            "discussion": "",
            "body": "This proposal came too late to be one of the options in the [Akita, a path forward](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM) poll, which at the moment is leading with \"Sell 10%, stream 90%\" and \"Liquidate 100%\" so I will propose it as a further discussion on the merits of how to implement it. This was posted on June 1st as a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1399892313007083522?s=21) and gathered some positive feedback from many of the community representatives.\n\n## The issue with the two main proposals\n\n* There's not enough market depth to liquidate all Akita tokens without losing a lot of value for Gitcoin. Even if there are serious doubts about the long term viability of the Akita community, we have a responsibility to maximize the value gained for Gitcoin. \n* Locking Akita on Sablier doesn't put that capital to good use, and if the market crashes and recovers and crashes again during before the stream is over, then there was a missed opportunity.\n\n\n## The Proposed Implementation\n\n1) Sell 10% of Akita in any exchange, put it in the Gitcoin treasury\n2) Sell yet another 10% into ETH. \n3) Create a Scheduled Balancer pool with the 10% ETH obtained in step 2 and all the remaining Akita.\n4) Set up the pool controller to programmatically change the ratio over a period P so that it inverts from a 10% ETH 90% AKITA into a 90% ETH and 10% AKITA\n5) After period is over, the community can decide what to do with the remaining tokens. \n\nThose types of pools are usually called **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** and are often used to launch new tokens that don't have liquidity. In this case, the token has launched but it would still bootstrap the liquidity. You can read more about LBPs on this article about [Radicle](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/radicles-new-record-lbp-sale-shows-that-lbps-are-here-to-stay-4c81e15a4d4d).\n\nTo make sure the market doesn't dump immediately, we could do step 1 and 2 using [Gnosis Auctions](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-auction-launch-390124d56248): this would take off some buy pressure immediately and then make sure the starting price of the LBP is closer to what other market makers have.\n\n\n## The end result is that:\n* At the end of the period, Gitcoin will have sold most of their Akita, at a fairer market price, similarly to a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy\n* Akita community gets a much more liquid market, a \"billion\" dollars deep (emphasis on the air quotes). This will reduce the impact any single seller can have on the final price.\n* All trades that are executed against this pool will earn fees for Gitcoin, so in periods of high volatility Gitcoin is leveraging its massive Akita Holdings to generate Yield\n* There will be a constant sell pressure on Akita, but it's one that is scheduled and known\n\n\n## Variants and Risks\n\nBalancer Pools are quite flexible and we could do other options like having a pool that starts at 91% Akita, 3% GTC, 3% ETH and 3% DAI. Or we could add all the dog tokens into a big billion dollar pile of dog ~~poo~~ money.\n\nPools also don't necessarily need to be locked: we can add a smart controller so that Gitcoin DAO can accelerate the schedule at a later vote, or simply change it completely and use the [Pie DAO](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-pie-smart-pools-85a77a2dc22e) so that ratios can be changed at the will of GTC holders. Also, at any point, Gitcoin could vote to take the liquidity out of its own pool and receive it in either token of the pool.\n\nIt's also important to note that **LBPs are different than just selling a token**: the pool wants to keep a constant ratio at all times to reach its target, be it 10%, 25% or 90%. So it means that *the pool will both sell and buy akita for ETH* to keep the target ratio\u2013that's how AMMs work. A LBP changes that target ratio slowly over time, but it also is reacting to the market in real time. It means that, if akita drops to near 0, then the pool will automatically be buying akita with ETH until it reaches the desired balance, so almost ETH would be drained from the pool. But that ETH came from the Akita sale in the step 2, and the end result would be the same if the strategy was to stream or liquidate it anyway. On the other hand, if the market goes up again, that will mean the pool will start selling the cheap akita it bought back to ETH (plus the fees it got during the period) which is why pools make money from volatility. \n\nDisclaimer: I work for Balancer labs, but if the community wants to they can use other solutions. Balancer also has a \"LBP referral program\" but I am perfectly willing to either not claim it or to donate the BAL gained to Gitcoin.\n\n## Period P\n\nThis proposal leaves the P period open. The ending date of this poll is after the resolution of the [\"Akita - a path forward\" poll](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM), so votes should take the result of the other snapshot in consideration.\n\n1) Stream: a LBP of duration of 2 years\n2) Intermediary: make the LBP last 1 year\n3) Liquidation: a short LBP over 1 week\n4) Do an LBP but in [another configuration](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-liquidate-akita-for-eth/4255) or platform\n5) No LBP: just lock it Sablier or dump it all in uniswap, depending on the results of the Akita poll\n\n",

How the ETH is used is not apart of this proposal. =========================================  Proposal Update #2  After some conversations with the Akita community it has become clear that the best path to maximize our ETH outcome is to enable some form of participation with them. Highlights: There will be a buy back and burn program that funds the AKITA LBP, for every 1 akita purchased X will be burned(economics still being finalized). The ETH raised here will be put into the LBP with a time of completion set for 3 months. Based on our conversations I propose the following: Option 1: We split the LP Tokens as follows: 40% to Gitcoin 40% to Akita (streamed over the length of the LBP through Sablier) 20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale. Option 2: We split the LP Tokens as follows: 80% to Gitcoin 20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale. Option 3: We don\u2019t split the LP Tokens We agree to burn more Akita via Sablier by streaming to the 0x000 address Y tokens for each X Akita in the LBP. Without a serious burn or a share of the ETH being raised, AKITA is most likely to dump their token or fork us out entirely. Snapshot vote  Proposal Update #1  After today\u2019s Spaces call to discuss some of the proposals and based on some comments by Alex Van de Sande With the help of James Hancock we have adjusted my proposal to include a high level overview of the means by which the $AKITA would be liquidated to ETH. This process will be carried out by the DeFi Treasury Mgmt Workstream for ratification by the multi sig signers.  The what: A balancer smart pool will be created that is setup to supply the $AKITA:ETH Better for Gitcoin  more likely to get more capital for public goods. To liquidate now would get a ceiling of 2 million, done overtime in a less harsh matter is more likely to get more out of those tokens. avoids negative PR around dumping a project  Better for the Akita Community  Day 1 nothing changes It is usable liquidity for the duration of the pool. Predictable: The Akita community will know predictability what is happening mitigating fears of the unknown. Discouraging a \u201crun on the bank\u201d of akita to get out before Gitcoin does.  Things to work out after the proposal.  How to handle exposure to the token over the entire period. Is it worth withdrawing the pair token, or building a Smart pool with some custom ability to handle this. It would be best to avoid complete collapse if Akita went to zero in the middle of the transition.  At a ratio of 0.1%:99.9% ETH/AKITA shifting the weight linearly over time to 99.9%ETH/0.1% AKITA Snapshot Poll ",

                    "content": "This is getting popular in the rollup Snapshot poll of options, and I personally am favoring this proposal. I don\u2019t fancy gitcoin continuing to deal with this controversy over the next two years and I think it\u2019s important for us to set a better precedent than taking speculative positions on any tokens that happen to be sent to the multisig. It seems like people who are voting for this are favoring the option to dispose of 100% of the tokens while capturing some of the value, in the shortest possible time However, if what Scott said in the other thread is true, it sounds like \u201cdispose of 100% while capturing some value\u201d would require us to still integrate some of the other proposal options. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here. Scott says:  there doesn\u2019t appear to be an efficient way to sell more than 10% even using a variety of methods due to liquidity constraints. So in some sense if you believe the community should vote to sell, for short term purposes (say in the next 3-6 months) a proposal to sell 10% is equivalent to a proposal to sell 100% just without removing the potential for future disposition.  As discussed in that other thread it would be beneficial if we could talk through exactly how this liquidation happens. If it\u2019s only possible to liquidate 10% immediately, then what about using Simona\u2019s proposal to put the rest in a 5/95 pool and simply leave it? I\u2019m looking for more specificity on how we accomplish this to give this proposal more credibility. ",

So apparently only the public goods deemed worthy by gitcoins leaders are what matters. You\u2019re in essence going to rug pull a very large community just to better help your own needs. Why would it not make more sense to help the community that allowed you to even receive these funds? Without the strength of the community that was built around Akita, those tokens would be worthless. So you\u2019re going to crush a community just to add liquidity to your guys projects. Seems like exactly the opposite thing you guys are trying to stand for. I can only see this negatively rippling through Gitcoins future and forever tarnishing your reputation. Gitcoin will fall just as rapidly as you will crush Akita. Eye for an eye as they say. Great job mates. Cheers ",
