To streamline the collaboration further, and to make it as accessible as possible, I\u2019ve created a new Discord server meant for discussing many of the different elements of the Endgame Plan, including the Decentralized Voter Committees, Delegates, Endgame Products and MetaDAOs This will be a place for detailed discussions on how to understand the Endgame Plan and how it can be improved. It\u2019s also a place to look for opportunities in MetaDAOs by finding other people that have aligned ideas and interests. I will be filling out the different channels with various bits and pieces of information that can provide the basis for further discussion, or people can simply pop in and find categories that seem relevant and start asking questions and providing input. Looking forward to engaging with as many of you as possible. Please join and have a look if you want to be a part of designing Makers future:    Discord    Join the Endgame Discord Server!
