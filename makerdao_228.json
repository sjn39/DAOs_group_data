                    "content": "Before we get into the thread, I\u2019d like to clarify that based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, delegation is a big win for MakerDAO as a whole. It is also clear to me that the time the delegates spend and the possible legal risks they are accepting makes it important that we compensate them adequately. Finally, the current number of delegates is insufficient - we need more people to prevent centralization of MKR voting power. I think the community is largely united on all the above points. In this thread, I\u2019d like to raise some issues with the governance process being followed for the delegate compensation. There are two parts to this - the first is the trial compensation period signal request here and the second is MIP61. @LongForWisdom and I briefly discussed this privately but we both agree that it is better if more people engage on this issue to chart our way forward. I also believe that this is not the first time we will run into these issues with our current process so I\u2019d rather they be fixed sooner than later.  Timeline The first informal poll here on 07-Sep had options compensating delegates up to 120k DAI per year excluding SourceCred. The highest option that got a non-zero number of votes was 96k DAI per year and the winning option was 48k DAI per year. MIP61 was created with 48k DAI being set as compensation. Next came the signal request on 13-Oct for trialing delegate compensation with this iteration of MIP61 in mind. This poll is still live but seems like it will almost certainly pass. @LongForWisdom then detailed his new thinking around higher delegate compensation here on 16-Oct where he suggested a three fold increase in compensation to 144k DAI per year in MIP61. This was incorporated into MIP61 and since it changed, the signal request asking to trial MIP61\u2019s compensation for three months also changed today, 19-Oct.  Problems I think there are several issues with how we\u2019re following governance process  While I understand the logic behind proposing higher compensation, I do feel that this did not get sufficiently discussed in the forum. There were no polls or signal requests on this matter after the first one. Most people who voted on the signal request for trial compensation did so with the 48k DAI compensation figure in mind i.e. MIP61 v1. After a change that significant, it doesn\u2019t seem acceptable to claim that the signal request passed. If governance was ever evil, this would be a sort of bait-and-switch tactic. Usually, 1. and 2. would be okay because the only risk at that point would be that the on-chain polls would fail. However, in this case, delegates are voting to raise their own compensation and are capable of swinging that vote. If they act in their own self interest, this would be a problem.  Let me put it another way: @LongForWisdom could have suggested an arbitrarily large amount and if the delegates vote in their own self-interest, both the trial compensation and MIP61 would still pass. To make it absolutely clear, I am not suggesting that either governance facilitators or delegates are trying anything shady here. The intentions of all parties, as far as I can see, are good. But the lack of checks and balances in how we\u2019ve gone about this has exposed vulnerabilities in our governance process and that is the for me, is problem enough that it\u2019s worth bringing up.  Next steps I think that MIP61, in its v1 version, which most of the signal request voters voted for should be what is polled on-chain. In parallel, a signal request with higher amounts can indeed be made and should go on chain only if it succeeds. The other tricky issue is delegates voting for their own compensation on-chain. I really appreciated @PaperImperium\u2019s decision to abstain on his supplemental (non-delegate work) compensation poll because it was the right thing to do. @flipflopflapdelegate also reflected on conflicts of interest in this post. Personally, I think that is the way forward. There are is enough undelegated MKR in the voting contract and enough shadow delegates who will vote on the on-chain poll. This sets the correct precedent for this issue, as well as for future issues where delegates may have conflicts of interest.  Long term solutions I admit that I don\u2019t have a great one to fix everything here but I will say some things.   I know there are concerns about the speed of the process. Governance is unfortunately slow because consensus takes time. This is true in most countries and it should be true in a DAO as well. I think there is an element of trying to rush it that is happening now. This can be dangerous and to be very honest, I don\u2019t think delaying decisions like this one by a month or two should ever be seen as a negative.   Our delegate recruitment rate isn\u2019t great. On this, I think the issue is that delegates are discouraged (although not forbidden) from having roles in a CU due to possible conflicts of interest. I would encourage the community to think about this more deeply. I can imagine a system where such conflicts of interests can be raised and the corresponding delegate abstains from voting. It might not be perfect but our best people are already part of one CU or another. Many of them would make excellent delegates, if such an arrangement was not discouraged.   Happy to hear everybody\u2019s thoughts! Particularly from the @Recognised-Delegates. ",

As detailed in Long\u2019s post, the legal/regulatory uncertainty is the main issue and the elephant in the room that hasn\u2019t really been addressed in detail in any of the delegate compensation posts. I would think that based on legal advice, one\u2019s decision to be a delegate or not would be somewhat binary and thus increasing the compensation would not have an impact nor address the root of the problem. Would like to hear the existing delegates thoughts on the matter. Looking across the blockchain space, if this was a serious legal issue no project would be able to operate. I also find it difficult to believe there is significant legal risk given that Harvard Law\u2019s blockchain club is a delegate themselves in a protocol that\u2019s currently under civil investigation.     flipflopflapdelegate:  At the moment there\u2019s nothing attractive to onboard, or motivate new Delegates.

Legal already costing me more than I \u2018earned\u2019 from Maker in my whole time here, SC, grants, BT compensation.   I had to ditch a first attorney because in the end I felt he could not represent me properly and look for another. Second point.  Any earnings basically have to pay SSI, taxes etc.    As @PaperImperium points out anyone I (as a MKR holder) would want for this job is probably going to be valued by competition at ~75-100hr (at least).  Why?  Because to manage something like Maker you have to know far more than any single CU to do it effectively.   And you have to deal with the politics as well, then heap on legal concerns just for the shitty icing on what delegates have to deal with. I have one CU that wants to pay me to do a proposal for them agreed to my 100/hr rate and asked me to get approval from GovAlpha to do this work.    BTW:  I get paid that now for my current employ because I have decades of experience, great attention to detail, and basically not easy to replace.   I have much younger collegues doing same work for 2-4x my current rate in various fortune 500 companies.   I happen to be in a cheaper location, pretty much nearing retirement, I have a very good relationship with my current direct supervisor (who values my time such that I get basically free reign to manage myself as long as I get the job he needs done - far more valuable working <80hr/week for 2-4x the pay). I am still trying to figure out how to manage all of this as I near retirment.   The legal part of this is the biggest cost and hassle btw eating significant chunks of capital and time.   I have been right on the fence because of this one single issue. In the end with a sum total of 61 MKR delegated to me (<10 from myself) I look at all of this and wonder if someone else is probably a better delegate. I really don\u2019t have any answers here.   I do agree with @AstronautThis pointing out the real issues with how this was handled in governance and have been told repeatedly not just by GovAlpha but other CUs that once something mustered forum discussion polling that it was a done deal in a governance sense. I feel strongly conflict of interest here so have tried to sideline any real depth discussion on this.  More and more though I think delegates should have to muster past a poll with at least 10-20K MKR supporting them to be added to delegate roles.   This is basically to weed out people who may never actually capture any MKR delegation vote early rather than late. I do really want to know how Maker is going to handle delegates working with/for CUs btw as I see this kind of partnership as a good thing, but it does have some hazards particularly with a delegate that can pass their own greenlight polls with their own delegated MKR.

Perhaps we could also increase/modify SourceCred. This is definitely an amount that will attract quite a bit interest in the long run (if not from US, elsewhere, this is a decent salary in most of Europe, especially for a part-time job) If there are no delegates today, this is mostly due to the fact that as a community we are not attracting a lot of attention (little onchain participance, growing but still little forum activity etc).     PaperImperium:  Let me put it this way: I\u2019ve had offers to manage bags of other protocol governance tokens. Range from $80k to $150k+equity+bonuses.   You have mentioned this several times. Always in a opaque (imho) way:  who offered you this? Is it a DAO? If so, is there a reason to keep it secret? why didn\u2019t you accept?   And that\u2019s not pay that starts at best in December or January, pending a vote by people who are likely not super engaged   again, is this a DAO? Maybe we can learn from them if we have more info. You also mentioned elsewhere that a CU offered you a salary (for what? I am not sure). Which CU? Why haven\u2019t accepted? What would be wrong with that?  ",

The problem is that we have had no volunteers at that price point, and two of the delegates are no longer going to continue, and one is also seeking employment elsewhere. We need delegates to ensure effective governance. We aren\u2019t going to attract and retain delegates at the 48k max expenditure.     iammeeoh:  Me too. Perhaps we could also increase/modify SourceCred.   Yes, we will probably propose something like this too.  To be clear, I share many of your concerns. In our judgement we can\u2019t guarantee safe and effective governance without delegates. There is just not enough of an incentive for MKR Holders (large or small) to vote regularly and consistently. We need to attract more delegates. Offering higher incentives is the easiest and likely the most long-term effective way of attracting delegates.     SebVentures:  Until we get at least 5 delegates with more than 10k MKR from many backers, the whole delegation experience is a failure anyway.   This is more or less how we\u2019re seeing it. There is currently not a great choice for MKR Holders if they want to delegate, and this will cause significant centralization issues as soon as more MKR Holders start delegating.  With respect to the process. I made it clear in the trial signal thread that the point was to \u201cadjust the system over the three months as necessary to attract and compensate delegates.\u201d However, we\u2019re not going to start paying out anything until the end of November in any case. So I can put up another signal if people feel that it\u2019s warranted. Given that we haven\u2019t started yet, I was hoping to save everyone some time by wrapping it up into the first one. ",

I started having meetings last Friday and it\u2019s just taking a while to get to all of them. I will not be leaving Maker completely no matter what.

Given that it\u2019s obfuscated who the largest MKR Holder is, everyone assumes it\u2019s not them, and no one pays the costs. The only way to force cooperation is to have the protocol pay for delegates, such that the cost is divided between all MKR Holders. Is this unfair for smaller MKR Holders that actively vote? Yes, absolutely. But smaller MKR Holders that actively vote can\u2019t secure the hat or pass proposals without significant cooperation from other smaller MKR Holders - and again, it\u2019s not in their best interests to do so given their relative vote-weight. If we had sufficient smaller MKR Holders voting, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation where we need delegates. But that isn\u2019t the case.

If they stop bluffing and actually quit, eventually the market will find equilibrium and the MKR holders will be forced to pay for their delegates.     LongForWisdom:  It is game theoretically not in their best interest to do so with the exception of the largest MKR Holder. Given that it\u2019s obfuscated who the largest MKR Holder is, everyone assumes it\u2019s not them, and no one pays the costs.   I disagree, see above point. This is only the case for as long as delegates are willing to work for free.     LongForWisdom:  If we had sufficient smaller MKR Holders voting, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation where we need delegates. But that isn\u2019t the case. Unfortunately you\u2019re an outlier rather than the norm given that you consistently and actively vote @g_dip.   Then MKR holders deserve to be diluted. That\u2019s how the system was designed. If you don\u2019t want to participate, you defer your vote to those that do and deal with the consequences. Now this isn\u2019t to say that delegators can\u2019t pull this off and get subsidized compensation for their delegates, but I think we should all acknowledge that this is the consequence of the above game theory in action - if you don\u2019t vote, you deserve to subsidize the delegates because you\u2019ve deferred your vote to the people who are actually participating. I think the delegates should stop abstaining and vote for their own comp if other MKR holders are too lazy to come in and override it. ",

This was always possible with the previous contract (VoteProxy) as well - but it\u2019s true that the barrier to entry is lower now.     g_dip:  I think the delegates should stop abstaining and vote for their own comp if other MKR holders are too lazy to come in and override it.   I\u2019m inclined to agree on this. Our assumption has always been that delegates will vote in favour of their own compensation if given the opportunity. We can\u2019t operate under any other assumption than that, given that we can\u2019t guarantee delegates will be altruistic. If MKR Holders don\u2019t like it there are both active (undelegate now) and passive (delegate contract expiry) mechanisms to prevent abuse by delegates. ",

As it is voting that wouldn\u2019t be cast otherwise it doesn\u2019t impact the decision making, it only greases the system. You don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time on that. ",
