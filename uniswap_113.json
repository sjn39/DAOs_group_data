                    "content": "I woke up today to a lot of rantings about a decision by Uniswap Lab to remove certain tokens from the UI.    cryptodaily.co.uk    Uniswap Labs Imposes Restrictions On Over 100 Tokens The announcement comes as a cautionary strategy, with Uniswap Labs citing \u201cthe evolving regulatory landscape      There are a lot of views from both angles as to whether it is good or bad. One of the key factors of uniswap success is its simple UI. The UI is a key part of the protocol. And yet it isn\u2019t decentralized in the sense of the word.   twitter.com    Andre Cronje @AndreCronjeTech    My unsolicited opinion;  Uniswap, a company registered in the US https://t.co/qC63EcZHVi, a website owned by the US entity Uniswap smart contracts, decentralized code  The company should act in its best interest, including censoring the website where it is in their interest.   11:45 PM - 23 Jul 2021           348                30            So, my take is: maybe the community should build it\u2019s own UI ?  One that is owned and controlled by the community? one that doesn\u2019t have any particular party behind it for some powers that be to threaten it with regulatory weapons for it to bend a knee?  I don\u2019t know this is just a rant but what do you think? ",

I plan on making the ENS links uncensorable, but right now I do have the ability to redirect ENS so keep that in mind when using the ENS addresses. ",
