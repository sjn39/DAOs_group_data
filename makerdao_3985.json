                    "content": "I have all of the skill required here and a wealth of insight and knowledge in the applicable fields. I hold MKR and have guided friends and family through the process of investing in UNIv2 pools and subsequently opening vaults and reinvesting DAI to maximize yields. I am highly organized, methodical, and am one of the rare people who can move between working as an engineer or customer-facing presenter/speaker, interpreting engineering lingo to executives and customers simultaneously, and/or being a customer-facing employee. All the while, I am able to do this  while maintaining specific organizational priorities in mind. I have spent most of the last 15 years working as a Sales Engineer (aka Solutions Architect) which does precisely that, but my personal crypto investments have allowed me to focus narrowly on the DeFi, TradFi, and economics fields relevant to success at this position. I am extremely good with Visio and Excel and can produce turnkey solutions individually or on a team because of my diverse range of computer-based and finance-based skills. I view teamwork as crucial to the success of all organizations. I have no problem meeting deadlines because of my ability to utilize high wpm typing skills and shortcuts to maximize efficiency in using any application while not increasing susceptibility to error. Project management, video conference, Figma/Miro (I have expertise in similar products such as Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft Whiteboard or Mural), Excel and Visio are absolutely in my wheel-house, too. I focused on data security and storage as a firewall/security engineer for the Aruba/HP wireless line now called HP Wireless, and am very familiar with RFCs and EIPs from my time as a solutions architect and my own time as an investor performing due diligence (DYOR). I have done University research before and I could do great work with my background in econometrics and statistics, as I am familiar with using R for regression analysis. If given access to the appropriate data, I will conduct stellar research, continuously, or delegate it appropriately, as the Principle/Director level team member. If you are interested, give me a shout at 562 666 6974 or email me at [email\u00a0protected]. Thanks! ",
