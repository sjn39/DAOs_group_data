I would love to start a discussion about whether it is feasible to pay dividends to Maker token holders outside of just the standard Maker burning process (which is itself a form of a dividend). What I envision is that on a quarterly basis \u2013 holders of Maker could verify themselves as holders of a certain amount of tokens as of an Ex-Dividend Date (perhaps similar to how we use our tokens to vote on governance items currently). By verifying their ownership \u2013 they could receive their dividend distribution in Dai. Requiring this active process from Maker holders would accomplish a couple things: A) Improve the voting engagement of the Maker community. If they have to engage quarterly for dividends, perhaps they engage more often on other votes. B) Any unclaimed dividends could simply be used to buy back more Maker tokens in the standard burn procedure. Many institutional investors have a mandate that they can only invest in products that pay some form of dividend. If we offered a first of its kind dividend in the cryptocurrency ecosystem \u2013 I think we could attract some institutional investment that we have only scratched the surface of so far. The dividend doesn\u2019t have to be big (a number of publicly traded stocks pay a 0.5-1.5% dividend per year). The dividend would not replace the burning feature \u2013 just be an additional perk of holding Maker. That\u2019s the idea! I\u2019d love to hear feedback! Thanks! ",

Mainly because of the same incentives issue, because if you start to give those incentives, several factors may occur, such as:   A lot of interest in buying MKR, that will generate that it will be increasingly difficult for a common user who wants to participate in governance can not access MKR, although there may be the advantage of actively participating in the forum.   If these incentives are stopped, it can create a strong sales pressure for MKR.   Still better incentive than making the right decisions can make your MKR more scarce and valuable sounds better.       Leritu:  B) Any unclaimed dividends could simply be used to buy back more Maker tokens in the standard burn procedure.   If we focus on the second proposal, you could make MKR more of an asset, as I feel this can generate a lot of interest, not only from diverse communities but also from strong institutional players.
