Note: This is a MIP6 application being submitted by Anchorage Lending CA, LLC     Summary Terms:      Counterparty: Barrow Lending II LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company (\u201cBLII SPV\u201d), wholly-owned by Anchorage Lending CA, LLC, a California licensed commercial lender and Delaware limited liability company, wholly-owned by Anchor Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation.   The Real World Asset(s): Anchorage Lending originated loans and leases to crypto-mining operators secured by ASIC machines.

Such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed to Anchorage as part of the 1st disbursement.   Timeline Anchorage anticipates that the transaction can be signed within 3 months of an affirmative green light.    (A) Executive Summary This MIP6 is submitted by Anchorage Lending CA, LLC (\u201cAnchorage Lending\u201d), a California licensed commercial lender (License No. 60DBO-119768) owned by the privately-held holding company Anchor Labs, Inc (\u201cAnchor Labs\u201d).  Anchorage Lending CA, LLC is subject to regulatory oversight from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation of California.  Anchor Labs owns several subsidiaries including a federally regulated digital bank (\u201cAnchorage Digital Bank\u201d or \u201cADB\u201d) and is (through its subsidiaries) subject to the regulatory regimes of various bodies that include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the United States Federal Reserve (Fed), and the National Futures Association (NFA). Anchorage Lending proposes using a legal structure wherein BLII SPV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anchorage Lending and bankruptcy remote entity, enters into a Loan and Security Agreement with a Trust for the benefit of MakerDAO (the \u201cMakerDAO Lending Trust\u201d). Anchorage Lending will originate loans or leases made to crypto-mining business operators (which it originates) so that the operators can lease or purchase specific ASIC\u2019s (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) to grow their mining operations. Anchorage Lending will sell such loans (\u201cEligible Collateral\u201d) to BLII SPV. BLII SPV will pledge those loans as collateral security for the revolving line of credit provided by the Trust. Process wise, Anchorage Lending will originate verified compliant loans and sell them to the BLII SPV.  When the BLII SPV draws on the line of credit, the MakerDAO Lending Trust will advance an amount at maximum of 80% of the unpaid principal balance of the Eligible Collateral sold to the BLII SPV.  The remaining principal will have been funded by Anchorage Lending and will be subject to losses before the principal on the loan from MakerDAO Lending Trust. Each subsequent payment from the loan borrower will be distributed according to a waterfall of payments, codifying that funds will flow first for an agreed class of expenses and fees (e.g., taxes (if any), trustee fees, servicing fees), then to the MakerDAO Lending Trust to satisfy principal and interest due, and finally to the BLII SPV (paid back as dividends to Anchorage Lending). Compliant crypto-mining equipment loans are ones that: (1) are originated by Anchorage Lending according to its policies and guidelines, (2) have fixed rates of 10-20%, (3) have 12 to 36 months of term, (4) are amortizing (via a straight-line schedule after a 0-6 month interest-only period), (5) are typically issued at a maximum 75% Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio, (6) are senior secured by interests in existing equipment (the collateral) without other indebtedness or claims against them (for loans) or Anchorage held USDC security deposits (for leases), and (7) are recourse loans or leases, allowing Anchorage to pursue claims against the borrower or lessee (in addition to the applicable equipment). All loans originated by Anchorage Lending are done so during its ordinary course of business and comply with the Bank\u2019s policies and guidelines.  Furthermore, all loans to be sold to BLII SPV and used as collateral against draws on the revolving line of credit must meet all standard credit and risk conditions of Anchorage Lending described herein. Going forward, Anchorage, through Anchorage Lending and its affiliates, hopes to enhance its relationship with MakerDAO.  In addition to this potential line of credit, Anchorage already allows institutional clients: (i) to custody both Maker and DAI tokens at Anchorage Digital Bank, (ii) to participate in Maker Governance without sacrificing the safety or security of private custody, and to (iii) borrow against and trade MKR and DAI tokens through its lending and agency trading desks.  In the future, we will continue to work with Maker to determine future partnership opportunities.  We may have a need to find matched funding for fixed and open term crypto-backed loans for which Maker\u2019s current institutional vault product or another line of credit may be a solution. (B) Anchorage Lending Business Model Description Anchorage Lending operates mainly as a marketplace.  It facilitates the deployment of lender client funds into lending facilities (chosen by client lenders) to be distributed into loans with similar characteristics, namely the same lent asset denomination and level of collateralization.  In addition, Anchorage Lending vets both borrowing and lending counterparties by onboarding (having them successfully complete our KYC / AML processes), servicing (invoicing and communicating with them on margin calls and liquidations), and, only for borrowers, underwriting (from both a credit and risk perspective) them.  When Anchorage Lending deploys client lender funds into lending facilities, it does so on behalf of client lenders as an agent. On a very limited basis, Anchorage Lending does principal lending, including with existing capital providers as the junior tranche for a warehouse line against which mining related assets are pledged.  We also have from time to time deployed principal capital into our lending facilities as well. (C) Anchorage Loan Historical Volume and Performance Anchorage Lending has a strong track record of origination. Anchorage Lending has originated total loan volumes (including new and refinanced crypto and mining equipment backed loans and leases of all asset denominations) of over $2.5Bn. The weighted average interest rate for USD / USDC denominated, overcollateralized, crypto-backed loans has fluctuated between 4.6% to 8.7% over the course of 2022, respectively. Exhibit: Anchorage Quarterly Origination Volumes by Loan Denominated Asset  Chart1194\u00d7506 27.4 KB  Notes: Data includes mining loans and overcollateralized, undercollateralized or unsecured crypto-backed loans and refinanced loans to existing borrowers. Historically, Anchorage Lending client lenders have never incurred a loss due to, in large part, Anchorage Lending\u2019s conservative underwriting practices and strong loan servicing operations. Anchorage Lending has, however, performed many effective margin calls. During the last two market drawdowns in February and June 2022, borrowers topped up within 45 and 150 minutes on average after receiving notice. Anchorage Lending only performed one liquidation in those two time periods and for that liquidation event Anchorage sold collateral in excess of the loan amount. For mining-related loans, Anchorage Lending has originated over $170MM of term loans and leases to crypto-mining borrowers during the past year. These loans are denominated in both USDC and BTC and yield 10-16% and 5-12%, respectively. They have terms of at most 2 years. In addition, Anchorage has $200MM of immediate, inbound borrower (and lessee) demand for additional financing capacity. Anchorage Lending would like to expand its mining footprint and it already possesses the operation capability to do so, but it needs more term funding sources to match its projected origination volume. Generally speaking, Anchorage only lends to the highest quality institutions, who have undergone our rigorous, OCC-level KYC / AML onboarding process and credit and risk underwriting assessments. Crypto-miner borrowers must additionally be located in the United States or Canada, have strong balance sheets, a history of profitability, operational excellence, an existing data center with machines online, low cost electricity, and use mainly (at least 50%) renewables-based power sources. Illustrative Mining Loan Underwriting Case Study For reference purposes, we provide a description of the underwriting process for a hypothetical, idealized miner looking to finance the purchase of ASIC mining equipment.   Onboarding: The first step in the process is onboarding the borrower, which requires it to complete a credit questionnaire and pass a KYC and AML evaluation process.   Financial Review and Physical Site Visit: Next, Anchorage Lending reviews the borrower\u2019s financials to determine its financial strengths and weaknesses. We communicate with the borrower to better understand their current financial condition and future projections. We also visit the borrower\u2019s premises to inspect the facility. We have provided some sample financials below for the hypothetical miner for illustrative purposes.   Financial Modeling: Anchorage Lending models the cash flows resulting from the ASIC financing transaction using different BTC and hash rate scenarios. The goal of this analysis is to determine the projected financials for the company under the base case, where BTC prices and hash rates stay near current values, and the bear case, which specifies the estimated BTC price at which mining becomes uneconomic for the miner (where their operating income is approaches zero). Exhibit: Sample Mining Operator Financial Statements and Projections  674\u00d7985 51.1 KB    Deal Terms: We use the borrower\u2019s financial condition and these projections to set the terms of the loan, and determine the additional loan covenants the borrower can reasonably bear that serve to protect the lender in adverse scenarios. We have included an example of the types of terms and covenants Anchorage Lending would require for this type of borrower and transaction below. In this hypothetical example, Anchorage Lending will extend $10MM of credit (at a 12% interest rate for 24 months), the borrower will contribute $10MM of its own equity dollars and purchase $20MM worth of mining rigs (upon which Anchorage Lending will file UCC liens). Anchorage Lending will insist that the borrower maintain a collateral coverage ratio above 110% by contributing additional assets as collateral in the case the rig value breaches that threshold. In an adverse scenario (where BTC falls to a breakeven threshold of ~$11,000 and the borrower\u2019s operating profits are de minimis), Anchorage will insist the borrower maintain a level of unencumbered current assets to ensure it can cover the loan expenses (principal and interest) and operating expenses for up to 1 year (which it can do based on breakeven projections). Anchorage also requires that it will have approval authority over new borrower debt transactions. The terms and covenants are then presented to the borrower. If approved, Anchorage Lending completes a risk memo that must be approved by the Risk Committee before the loan is originated. Exhibit: Sample Terms and Covenants  818\u00d7814 47.5 KB    (D) Summary Line of Credit Terms Anchorage Lending is requesting a line of credit from MakerDAO to be lent to the BLII SPV. The BLII SPV will pledge Eligible Collateral to secure the line of credit. The requested initial debt ceiling for the first Loan and Security Agreement is two-hundred million dollars ($200M) lent against Anchorage Lending originated mining equipment loans and leases to be deployed over a period of up to thirty-six (36) months from inception. The line interest rate will be fixed rate. It is proposed that Maker fund the Trust up-front so that dollars committed but not yet disbursed to BLII SPV can accrue interest income for the Trust (i.e., Maker) vis-a-vis US treasuries (or similar). Anchorage Lending will be the loan and lease servicer utilizing Anchorage Lending\u2019s servicing desk, which runs around the clock and has handled billions of dollars of loan transactions since 2020. The total servicing fees will be equal to two percent (2.0%) per annum on the outstanding balance of loans pledged against the line of credit. At MakerDAO\u2019s option, for the purpose of scaling and diversifying real world asset collateral, MakerDAO could expand the scope of the this first Loan and Security Agreement or enter into additional Loan and Security Agreement with Anchorage Lending, with debt ceilings to be determined at the time of approval and issuance, allowing for the Trust to lend against additional mining equipment loans and leases or crypto-backed loans originated by Anchorage Lending with floating and fixed rates. These additional lines of credit are not included in the Loan and Security Agreement and are being highlighted as an option to increase scale and diversification of real asset collateral for DAI. Any subsequent Loan and Security Agreements will contain mutually agreed upon parameters between the MakerDao Lending Trust and Anchorage Lending, including that Anchorage Lending retain a minimum ownership sufficient to align its interests with MakerDAO.

(Answer 1.c.(i.-iii.)): How are interests aligned in the proposed structure? The proposed structure would involve a special purpose vehicle (BLII SPV) owned by Anchorage Lending containing the crypto-miner loans that would secure a line of credit from the MakerDAO Lending Trust (MDLT).  The line of credit would be overcollateralized and funds would be lent out at an advance rate. For this structure, there are no known conflicts of interests. All loans and leases will be originated in accordance with Anchorage Lending\u2019s policies, guidelines, and underwriting standards. The MDLT will always be the senior debt capital lent at (up to) an 80% advance rate (the final percentage to be negotiated) against the loan collateral and Anchorage Lending will originate and fund each loan used as collateral for draws against the line of credit. Monthly payments from the crypto-mining loan collateral will be used to pay down the senior debt principal and interest first.  The residual thereafter will accrue to the BLII SPV (and thus, Anchorage Lending, as the owner of the BLII SPV).  As such, Anchorage Lending capital will absorb principal losses first (20% of the loan collateral principal value) while MakerDAO benefits from Anchorage Lending\u2019s incentive to avoid losses and maximize yield. (Answer 1.d.(i.-iii.)): Describe Anchorage Lending\u2019s Business Units, Origination Team, Technology, and Leadership Within Anchorage Lending, the origination and servicing of loans and leases is handled by the lending and risk department\u2019s servicing desk which includes (i) the core Lending team of experienced lenders, business developers, and closing professionals, (ii) the core Risk team that includes a team of underwriting specialists and credit analysts, (iii) and the core Data Science team that includes a team of quantitative modelers and programmers. Anchorage Lending utilizes a suite of resources to support the origination and servicing of loans including: (i) an underwriting evaluation process, and (ii) a custom, in-house built collateral management system which tracks the status of outstanding loans, the value of loan collateral, and several real-time metrics used to notify borrowers of real-time alerts. (Answer 1.e.ii.(1(a.-j.), 2)): What is Anchorage Lending\u2019s credit rating system? Within Anchorage Lending, the origination and servicing of loans and leases is handled by the lending and risk department\u2019s servicing desk which includes (i) the core Lending team of experienced lenders, business developers, and closing professionals, (ii) the core Risk team that includes a team of underwriting specialists and credit analysts, (iii) and the core Data Science team that includes a team of quantitative modelers and programmers. Anchorage Lending utilizes a suite of resources to support the origination and servicing of loans including: (i) an underwriting evaluation process, and (ii) a custom, in-house built collateral management system which tracks the status of outstanding loans, the value of loan collateral, and several real-time metrics used to notify borrowers of real-time alerts. Anchorage Lending maintains a robust and comprehensive risk management framework, which takes into consideration client and product risks (amongst others) to determine appropriate rates, thresholds, and loan amounts for clients seeking overcollateralized and undercollateralized loans. This risk framework has different components, which are assessed in total and not independently. Descriptions of risk categories include:   Client Specific Risk: Client risk takes into account a client\u2019s financial information and health, financial metrics using a third party risk aggregator to verify financial statements (as applicable), and potential red flags identified during the general onboarding process (e.g. negative financial news). When a client opens an account with Anchorage, compliance conducts a CDD / EDD review on the client, which includes the identification of negative news related either to the client entity or individuals listed on the accounts (such as control persons or beneficial owners). Clients are provided with an Anchorage Digital risk credit questionnaire, which covers, in depth, questions regarding internal risk management and business / operational due diligence within the client\u2019s organization. Furthermore, a client due diligence meeting is conducted to understand the client\u2019s business practices and other concerns prior to issuing a loan. Based on a thorough review of a client\u2019s due diligence responses, the risk team determines a client credit rating, which maps to a corporate credit rating (e.g. S&P, Moody\u2019s rating).  Following client due diligence, a client\u2019s financial / risk profile may be assessed by the Risk Committee, which then provides final guidance on borrower loan terms to the Lending team.   Collateral Specific Risk: Anchorage uses a custom modeling suite and appraisal framework to rate the quality of collateral received, and determine the appropriate implications on loan terms. By using historical and stochastic models, as well as repayment models (based on customized assumptions) the suite helps determine the set of drawdowns in volatile markets. The suite also incorporates liquidation costs for a given collateral asset to determine loan terms, including the loan amount, interest rate, and initial, margin call, and liquidation thresholds for different types of collateral received.   Product Specific Risk: Product risk considers the implied exposure from the proposed loan term and structure. For example, an over-collateralized loan with more volatile collateral may be deemed of higher risk than an under-collateralized loan with less volatile collateral.   Market Specific Risk: During periods of market stress, Anchorage Lending further tightens its credit underwriting standards in an effort to accommodate client lender withdrawals and account for the fact that overall borrower creditworthiness is likely falling.   Mining-Specific Underwriting Requirements: Generally speaking, Anchorage only lends to the highest quality institutions, who have all undergone our rigorous, OCC-level KYC / AML onboarding process and credit and risk underwriting assessments. Crypto-miner borrowers must additionally be located in the United States or Canada, have strong balance sheets, a history of profitability, operational excellence, an existing data center with machines online (which must be submitted to an onsite evaluation), low cost electricity, and a mainly renewables based power source   (Answer 1.e.i.2): Describe the individual lending decision process, along with \u201capprovers\u201d and a \u201ccommercial loan summary\u201d. The process for underwriting a borrower is straightforward.  First, the borrower must sign Anchorage\u2019s MLSA or other loan documents (including a Master Lease Agreement or Equipment Loan Agreement) and be onboarded to Anchorage Digital Bank, which includes the successful completion of a credit questionnaire and KYC / AML check.  Next, the Lending team negotiates preliminary loan terms with the borrower and the borrower submits credit and collateral specific information to the Risk underwriting team.  At the same time, the risk modeling suite is used to determine collateral coverage ratios that are acceptable to the borrower. For crypto-backed loans, a non-binding, Anchorage Lending team-approved term sheet is issued to the borrower once agreement is reached.  Assuming the borrower passes the underwriting process, the prospective loan must then be approved by a majority of Risk Committee members, which consists of the Head of Risk, Head of Compliance, and Head of Finance.  Upon Committee approval, the lending team sends a finalized term sheet to the borrower, who then must approve it.  The borrower then sends crypto collateral to an Anchorage vault, where it is held for the loan term, and the funds are sent to the borrower.  The borrower retains title to the collateral, but Anchorage Lending has a security interest in it and is able to liquidate it under certain conditions. For mining loans, the process is similar.  First, the borrower must pass the underwriting process, which includes an assessment of the collateral, the company\u2019s financials, and an onsite evaluation of its data center.  After a period of negotiation, the Lending team sends a term sheet to which the borrower must agree.  Once that occurs, the proposal is sent to the Risk Committee, the majority of which must approve of the deal.  Then Anchorage Lending files a UCC-1 financing statement to perfect its security interest.  If the structure is a lease, then Anchorage Lending owns the ASIC machines until the lease is paid off (also known as a sale leaseback), which may include a final balloon payment equal to the security deposit amount. (Answer 1.e.i.3. & 1.f.(i.-v.)): Describe the procedures Originator uses to evaluate the portfolio at the loan and aggregate levels. As described above, Anchorage Lending uses a custom built loan monitoring system that tracks individual loan collateral coverage ratios.  The servicing desk utilizes this system to margin call and potentially liquidate borrower crypto collateral if borrowers do not respond to notifications in a timely manner. For all ASIC collateral, we monitor the equipment by having viewer access rights into the miner\u2019s mining pool, which allows us to ensure the machines are functioning and to monitor BTC rewards production. Additionally, Anchorage conducts a site visit at loan origination and may perform additional ad-hoc visits if necessary.  If the machines need to be repossessed due to a default, Anchorage Lending will pursue a legal process if the machines are not voluntarily made available. All borrowers must pass the stringent underwriting process described above, which includes a multitude of inputs described in the Market Specific Risk section. (Answer 1.e.(iv.)): What is the process for changing Guidelines and Policies? At a minimum, credit risk policies are updated annually; however, a few sections within the policy such as due diligence improvements and financial model updates are actively monitored and updated to reflect the current market environment. Generally, changing guidelines and policies should include the following:   Change purpose   Policy statement which includes specifications, supporting documents, approvals and revision history   Governance impact   Policy maintenance and decommissions   (Answer 1.e.(v.)): What is the process for transitioning to another Servicer? If Anchorage Lending, as Servicer (the \u201cServicer\u201d), is guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct the Trustee may appoint a new Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Agreement. In the ASIC lending space, we have seen that loan and lease originators also serve as servicers and servicing rights are typically not outsourced to third-parties. (Answer 2): Describe Anchorage Lending\u2019s historical performance. Anchorage Lending has provided commercial lending services since 2020. Anchorage Lending is in the business of making commercial loans to businesses globally.  Anchorage Lending has originated total loan volumes (including new and refinanced crypto and mining equipment backed loans and leases of all asset denominations) of over $2.5Bn.  The weighted average interest rate for USD / USDC denominated, overcollateralized, crypto-backed loans has fluctuated between 4.6% to 8.7% over the course of 2022, respectively. For the year ended 2021, Anchorage Lending\u2019s loan originations had no loan losses. In fact, Anchorage Lending client lenders have never incurred a loss resulting from participation in the program\u2019s history. Anchorage Lending does utilize leverage sparingly through its relationship with a warehouse line provider to finance term mining loans. However, this exposure is small at less than 5% of its overall outstanding loan book. (Answer 2.(a.-b.)):What are the Eligible Collateral assets that can be used to draw against the line? Anchorage Lending seeks to enter into a borrowing arrangement with MDLT whereby BLII SPV can collateralize draws on a line of credit provided by MDLT with loans (and leases) against crypto mining equipment in furtherance of MakerDAO\u2019s goals for DAI stability, collateral diversification, and yield. The Trust would lend in a senior debt position against loans (the \u201cEligible Collateral\u201d) that are originated by Anchorage Lending and are in accordance with the credit inclusion conditions specified below. Anchorage Lending proposes that MakerDAO, through the MDLT, consider loans in the categories to follow: Loans Against New or Existing ASIC\u2019s \u2013 These loans offer MakerDAO predictable, modelable loan balances and interest income due to the fact that they generally, but not always, have fixed interest rates and terms (occasionally we origination floating rate term loans). The MDLT would make a one-time advance once each loan has been originated and receive steady cash flows on principal and interest over the remaining loan term. These loans, generally, have a 18 to 36 month term, but may have a 0-6 month interest only period before a straight-line amortization period until the loan matures. Borrower collateral against the loans would be valued and remotely monitored by Anchorage Lending. Collateral will consist of newer generation ASIC\u2019s (e.g. a baseline of either Bitmain Antminer S19 or MicroBT Whatsminer M30s+ series). These loans would typically originate at a maximum LTV of 75%. If the LTV increases past certain thresholds, Anchorage Lending reserves the right to margin call the borrower and ask it to provide additional collateral. In addition, Anchorage Lending would have full recourse to the borrower\u2019s balance sheet assets. Leases of New or Existing ASIC\u2019s \u2013 Anchorage Lending also leases out equipment to qualified lessees. Generally speaking the equipment itself is always newer generation ASIC\u2019s (e.g. also a baseline of either Bitmain Antminer S19 or MicroBT Whatsminer M30s+ series). Anchorage Lending typically requires lessees to put up a security deposit on equipment of at least 40% of the lease\u2019s value. Leases operate in a similar manner to loans in that they amortize down over an 18 to 36 month period with a 0-6 month interest only period in some cases. The machines themselves are owned by Anchorage Lending until the lease is paid down in full. It is understood that the MDLT and Anchorage Lending will enter into legally enforceable agreements that will ensure the compliance of all pledged assets with the Real World Asset Core Unit\u2019s investment criteria. However, it is the sole responsibility of MakerDAO and the MLDT to determine that the arrangement complies with those requirements. Anchorage Lending makes no warranties or representations regarding compliance with any Investment Grade debt requirement. (Answer 2.(a.-b.) & Answer 3.b): What is the Collateral Eligibility Criteria for the line of credit? In order to expedite MakerDAO\u2019s loan review process, Anchorage Lending proposes offering collateral loans or leases that match the following criteria:   The loan or lease is denominated in USD / USDC, is in good standing with Anchorage Lending, has a term of 18 to 36 months, and has satisfactory expected cash flows to cover both interest and principal payments on the line.   The borrower or lessee has been in business for at least 1 year (including prior forms of business organization) and has undergone a satisfactory risk assessment for KYC from Anchorage compliance.   The borrower or lessee and loan or lease structure has been risk approved by Credit Risk Management, whose risk evaluation takes the following into consideration:   Borrower / lessee risk profile: All borrowers must submit audited financials (if borrower/lessee does not have audited financials, then unaudited financials or other disclosures may be used)   Collateral risk profile for ASIC (mining) backed loans: All borrowers undergo additional borrower risk profile considerations, which include a review of additional qualitative and quantitative financial characteristics, and an equipment valuation. Anchorage Lending typically originates loans at a maximum Loan-To-Value (LTV) of 75%.     For loans and leases used as Anchorage will cap single-entity borrower or lessee concentration at 33% of the total asset pool.   (Answer 2.(a.-b.) & Answer 3.b): What is the process for requesting an advance? Following initial review, approval, and documentation of the line of credit with MDLT, the steps for requesting an advance on the line include:   Upon Anchorage Lending presenting a participation opportunity, the MDLT will receive access to a secured online data room folder which will contain a copy of Anchorage Lending\u2019s underwriting memo and associated loan documents.   The MDLT will review and respond with a lending decision within five (5) business days.   Upon approval the MDLT will advance its funds within 24 hours via Fedwire in USD or USDC.   As monthly loan payments are received, Anchorage Lending will remit to the Trust\u2019s account all monies received and owed to it, less any servicing or other fees (such other fees to be agreed), in accordance with the Loan and Security Agreement. Anchorage Lending will remit said funds to the Trust within three (3) business days of receipt and reconciliation after the conversion from USD or USDC to DAI has been performed. Anchorage Lending will be the loan and lease servicer utilizing Anchorage Lending\u2019s servicing desk, which runs around the clock and has handled over one billion dollars of loan transactions since 2020. The total servicing fees will be equal to two percent (2.00%) per annum on the outstanding balance of loans pledged against the line of credit. The requested initial debt ceiling for the first Loan and Security Agreement is two-hundred million dollars ($200M) lent against Anchorage Lending originated mining equipment loans and leases to be deployed over a period of eighteen (18) to thirty-six (36) months from inception. At MakerDAO\u2019s option, for the purpose of scaling and diversifying real world asset collateral, the MakerDAO could expand the scope of the first Loan and Security Agreement or enter into additional Loan and Security Agreements with Anchorage Lending, with debt ceilings to be determined at the time of approval and issuance, allowing for the Trust to lend against additional mining equipment leases and loans or crypto-backed loans originated by Anchorage Lending with floating and fixed rates. These additional lines of credit are not included in this first Loan and Security Agreement and are being highlighted as an option to increase scale and diversification of real asset collateral for DAI. Any subsequent Loan and Security Agreement will contain mutually agreed upon parameters between the MakerDao Lending Trust and Anchorage Lending, including that Anchorage Lending retain a minimum ownership sufficient to align its interests with MakerDAO. (Answer 2.(c.-d.)): What is the historical performance of mining loans? For mining related loans, Anchorage Lending has originated over $170MM of term loans and leases to crypto-mining borrowers during the past year.  These loans are denominated in both USDC and BTC and yield 10-16% and 5-12%.  They have terms of at most 2 years. Generally speaking, Anchorage only lends to the highest quality institutions, who have all undergone our rigorous, OCC-level KYC / AML onboarding process and credit and risk underwriting assessments. Crypto-miner borrowers must additionally be located in the United States or Canada, have strong balance sheets, a history of profitability, operational excellence, an existing data center with machines online, low cost electricity, and a renewables based power source. Answer 2.(f.): Describe the annual and quarterly financial statements. Anchorage completed its Series D in 2022 and has received a total of $487M in funding to date. Our latest funding round was led by global investment firm KKR. Participants included Goldman Sachs, Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo, accounts managed by BlackRock, and several others. Anchorage is valued at more than $3Bn, is backed by leading investors, and serves hundreds of clients whose combined portfolios total in the billions. Answer 1.i.v.: Three year financial model including required funding The proposed initial debt ceiling for the MDLT warehouse line is two-hundred million dollars ($200MM) to finance up to $250MM of assets (80% advance rate).  The assets are Anchorage Lending originated loans (and leases) collateralized by crypto-mining ASIC machines. The asset loans will mature over a twelve (12) to thirty-six (36) month period from inception. MakerDAO and the Trust agree that the warehouse line will be adequately funded such that it can meet the funding needs of Anchorage Lending during the term of the warehouse line agreement.  Thereafter, Anchorage Lending and MakerDAO can pursue increasing the debt limit in a manner that is mutually beneficial. The line of credit yield to MDLT (for the benefit of MakerDAO) will be a fixed rate. (Answer 3).: Describe the transaction financial structure. Anchorage Lending intends to establish BLII SPV, as a Delaware LLC special purpose vehicle into which it will sell Eligible Loans.  MDLT will then lend to the BLII SPV and will have a security interest in the loans (and leases) purchased by BLII SPV. The warehouse line shall be adequately funded at all times to meet the funding needs of Anchorage Lending. The BLII SPV may contain a revolving pool of assets, where Anchorage Lending originates new assets to the BLII SPV and services the assets as they amortize. The Loan and Security Agreement will stipulate mechanisms to ensure that the new on-boarded assets meet the eligibility criteria and the BLII SPV will act to make sure the other representations and warranties it makes in the agreements are maintained. (Answer 3.a.i).: Describe the (DAI to USD to DAI) conversion process. BLII will draw from and payback to the warehouse line in denominations of USD / USDC. BLII will assume the conversion rate between DAI and USD / USDC is always 1:1 and that any risks or costs stemming from a deviation from that ratio will be borne solely by MakerDAO and the MDLT. (Answer 3.a.ii.): Describe the priority of payments. Anchorage Lending will remit to the Trust\u2019s account all monies received and owed to it by the loan borrowers and lessees in accordance with the Loan and Security Agreement. Anchorage Lending will remit said funds to the Trust on a specific date each month (such as the 15th of the following month or next business day). Payments from the collateral loans are applied as follows:   First to administrative and servicing fees,   Then to interest and principal due to the MDLT,   And finally residual cash flows go to the BLII SPV to flow as a dividend to Anchorage Lending.   When new loans are sold into the BLII SPV as collateral against the line, the loan payments (denominated in USD / USDC) will be submitted to a Collection Account of BLII SPV kept at Anchorage Digital Bank. Anchorage Lending has the ability to convert those funds to DAI for remittance back to the MDLT. Similarly when the SPV draws funds from the line, those funds will be converted (by a third party conversion agent or Anchorage Lending) to USDC and submitted to a Funding Account held at Anchorage Digital Bank. The BLII SPV and Anchorage Digital Bank will enter into an Account and Control Agreement with MDLT to govern the transactions in the Collection and Funding accounts. Recurring transaction expenses for the MDLT such as trustee fees shall be taken from interest remitted to the Trust. DAI slippage costs will be borne by MDLT and expressly not included in the waterfall (Answer 3.a.iii.): What are the account controls for the warehouse line? The borrowing entity, BLII SPV, will be a Delaware LLC that will be administered by representatives of Anchorage Digital. The MakerDao Lending Trustee will be a financial institution that is well capitalized and will have limited administrative and commercial decision-making power. Advances from the MDLT account to a third-party conversion agent DAI vault may be directed by Anchorage, Trust Sponsor, or the Trustee - all of whom may be listed as eligible to direct transfers of capital back to MakerDAO.  The advance will be deposited into a Funding Account, which will be governed by a Deposit Account Control Agreement specifying MDLT as the Secured Party and the SPV as the Debtor.  The Collection Account, to which payments from collateral loan borrowers and lessees will be deposited, will be configured similarly. (Answer 4. a-e): Describe the transaction legal structure. The legal structure proposed involves the interaction of several counterparties. The main interaction is between Anchorage Lending\u2019s BLII SPV borrowing from MDLT against crypto-mining loans and leases. A description of the parties appears below.   Barrow Lending II LLC (BLII SPV): A legal entity built specifically for bankruptcy remoteness, the BLII SPV will be the borrower from the MDLT and will contain Eligible Collateral that can be used as collateral against warehouse line draws.   Anchorage Lending: Anchorage Lending will be the originator and servicer of the Eligible Collateral and will wholly own the BLII SPV.   MakerDao Lending Trust: A Cayman domiciled entity that is lending to the Anchorage Lending SPV. The MDLT will have a security interest in all the SPV\u2019s assets, including the Eligible Collateral, bank accounts, and SPV membership interests held by Anchorage Lending.   Maker Dao Lending Trustee   Conversion Agent: In order to ensure secure transactions from DAI to USD and vice-versa, the address of a regulated broker-dealer will be encoded into the MIP21 secure conduit. It is only this entity which will ever touch DAI. The broker-dealer has irrevocable instructions from the Trust Sponsor to only exchange DAI for USD and vice-versa based on pre-agreed upon terms and may only send that DAI or USD to the Trust Sponsor\u2019s escrow account with the Trustee\u2019s bank or to the secure conduit. Exhibit: Proposed Entity Configuration  970\u00d7887 30.1 KB    (Answer 5.d.): MakerDAO Specific Issues: Mandatory and administrative decisions. The terms and the final Agreements for the MDLT will be approved by a vote of MKR token holders. Thereafter, decisions by all Parties will be in accordance with those Agreements and if the Agreements are ambiguous then clarifying amendments will be brought to an MKR vote or to a trusted third party appointed by an MKR vote.

We have on-boarded entities from Cayman and in the US in the past and so I don\u2019t see jurisdiction to be a significant bottleneck if this proposal gets passed.  Thanks. ",

                    "content": "Hi @CodeKnight - thanks for commenting.  I get your point on PoW mining being risky collateral.  The counterpoints I would make is that: (1) Anchorage Lending would underwrite and originate the loans, and (2) we would put up first loss capital. We have a track record of underwriting and servicing nearly $170MM of mining loans well.  None of them have defaulted and we have not passed on any losses to our lenders.  In addition, for this type of warehouse line arrangement, Anchorage Lending would put up ~20% of first loss capital (with Maker providing the senior ~80%, for example).  This means the loans would need to incur more than 20% of the lent principal as losses before Maker takes a hit.  It also means that Anchorage stands behind our loans with our own funds since we are most exposed to defaults. Hope that helps. ",
