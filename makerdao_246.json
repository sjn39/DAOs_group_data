There was a deal in place with Polygon to on-board the MATIC token in exchange for them monetizing a significant part of their treasury. Discussions ranged from 30M Dai all the way to 100M Dai. Polygon did not hold up their end of the bargain, and after being confronted both digitally and in-person recently in ETH Lisbon gave no indication they have any intention of doing so. The community should off-board MATIC on principle for reneging on the deal irrespective of the fact that the vault has been performing extremely poorly (3,627 annual stability fees). The COMP, AAVE, and BAL vaults have very attractive rates (1% SF) compared to competitor platforms and have had ample time to build up a user-base. However, no usage has materialized. The stability fees generated are quite poor (see below) and don\u2019t come close to covering the Oracle gas-costs. As such, I\u2019m recommending the community offboard the COMP, AAVE, and BAL vaults.

BAL users also prefer to farm on Balancer. Truth be told, there is not a lot of demand for other vanilla ERC20 tokens used as collateral, plus we have few limiting factors:  either they are very illiquid on-chain and we can not offer high debt ceilings those who are liquid and interesting are some recently hyped and heavily farmed tokens that are very risky on its own and haven\u2019t really went through a stress test (OHM for instance) Maker doesn\u2019t offer cross collateralization, which hurts users if they need to maintain every single vault. It costs >$400 to maintain your vault right now (withdraw collateral and repay).  It is probably only LINK, UNI and YFI where we truly saw some serious demand in the past. I think Maker should mainly focus on three categories when it comes to onboarding new crypto assets:  ETH and WBTC derivatives (different LR, fixed rates, stETH type of products, etc.) LPs (again mostly ETH and WBTC based) D3M type of modules  D3M type of modules are particularly interesting in my opinion. It is the easiest way to scale, at some cases we get other protocol\u2019s backstop and offboarding is easiest. At Rari Capital Maker could even create a pool with its own set of rules. Of course there are also downsides to it, one is that we need to monitor them closely all the time and we start increasing Chainlink oracle dependancy. ",

The challenges since then were mainly around chasing the multi-sig signers given that there are a series of transactions that require to be initiated to open a vault. During this time, we have always been in touch with the Maker team; now finally we got the first step done by doing a test transfer of depositing 100,000 MATIC, 16 hours ago. In the next few hours, we will execute the full amount transaction given the test txn is successful. Polygon is long-term committed to supporting Maker, and DAI. There are parallel conversations from the Maker team happening with different members of the Polygon team for the growth and support of DAI, and Maker across the ecosystem. We would request the community to consider this vote because DAI liquidity is dependent on MATIC. Still apologies for the delay, and thank you to the Maker team for supporting us at every step. ",

That may contribute to the cause, but the effect is that the vaults are unprofitable and hence we should offboard them. Once we have Maker deployed on L2s the community can vote to re-activate these vaults to see if they are more viable there. The Oracle costs on L2 are significantly lower hence the threshold will be much lower to reach profitability. I see no reason to keep them onboarded in the meantime. ",

I mean what we can do short term to push those vaults into a profit zone, maybe adjust parameters like for example reduce the LR I know its a risk problem so the tradeoff would be to increase the fee (be more dynamic) and encourage not to give up so fast on the products. Apparently there is an agreement with Polygon which turned out postitive in the end, maybe the other teams have similar intentions. When there is nothing else left to change the current situation then yes offboard them. ",
