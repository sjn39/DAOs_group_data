Specifically the issue is that the login form doesn\u2019t come up when trying to log on to the Maker Chat server, I just get a Github button appearing. When I press that button everything freezes up. I\u2019ve tried Brave, Chrome, Safari, and the desktop client and am having the same issues on each. Thanks in advance. ",
