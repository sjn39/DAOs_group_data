I would like to propose that we agree to set a threshold for each vault that will trigger the need for a poll the following Monday for a specified amount to increase. Proposal: If a vault reaches 90% utilization before Friday 12:00 UTC then a governance poll will go out on the following Monday to increase the DC. Do you agree with this proposal?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If Yes, what should the DC increase % be?     10% 15% 20% 25% 30%     0 voters     Next Steps: If passed, I will submit a pull request to have this proposal added as a governance poll on the Monday after expiry. Once ratified, Governance Facilitators would be required to enact these changes when necessary. This poll will run until 2020-09-08T04:00:00Z NOTE: I am currently writing up a new proposal to ensure certain vaults don\u2019t exceed specified global DAI supply thresholds, so please keep that in mind. Edit: After input from @Primoz and @LongForWisdom I have decided to add another set of polls asking which Vaults this rule should apply to. Which Vault types should this rule apply to? ETH-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     BAT-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     USDC-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     USDC-B     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     WBTC-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     KNC-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ZRX-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     MANA-A     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

I would also add that if a signal request (if added) or a gouvernance poll doesn\u2019t pass, the collateral is removed from the \u201cautomation\u201d list until next DC increase (which would be issued by the community). This is just to avoid saying no each week. I like the proposal. It doesn\u2019t do much, just avoid not having the discussion and waiting the 99% limit before moving.

It\u2019s also worth noting that this just automates placing polls on-chain in the usual way. MKR Holders are still free to vote against if they feel that the increase is not advisable. I would prefer that we called this out on specific tokens though, rather than having this be so general. Doing something like this for USDC and / or WBTC seems sensible.

I find it silly that the system cannot currently absorb a 20% demand increase without wrecking the peg. Voting on DC changes every week is not a good long term solution. My general thought is that DCs need to be much higher, and we actually have risk parameters that are meaningful to the market to manage DAI supply. I also don\u2019t think people realize how the DCs prevent arbitrage either. No whales are trying to meaningfully arbitrage the peg because there is not enough cap room to do it in a short period of time, and a new DeFi toy could come out tomorrow that could wreck them. ",

My take on the things we should focus on:  bigger risk team more collateral ratios, especially for eth (we should try influence collateralization curve, to be as linear possible) we should have more liquidation events (to earn fees and have more confidence in keepers/liquidation system) governance improvements (priority should be avoiding bundled executive voting, voting cost is not that important problem atm)  I am very interested if printing mkr (to build strategic reserves, to pay more people) would be acceptable to the community? I really think we need to aim for something like 10m dai per year of costs and it does not look we can\u2019t get it with fees, at least in short term. I don\u2019t think we should compete with compound, yearn etc\u2026 Our product is decentralized (fungible) stablecoin  and we need to build as bigger \u201cmoat\u201d as possible. What is our moat? Probably dai brandname (first mover advantage) and community. To achieve bigger and wider moat, we need to pay people to get us risk models, RWA, top developers etc\u2026 Then project is much harder to fork and the main danger would be internal split. ",
