Our legitimate project (created first, is this hard to check?): Defining Web3: An Off-Chain Collective Research Project | Grants | Gitcoin The fake one: Defining Web3 | Grants | Gitcoin I have reported this project a couple of times now to both Gitcoin and Github and am told it will be addressed in Discord, but then hear nothing. As a last resort I am bringing it up here. One to highlight the specific problem and two to show how difficult it can be as a grantee to get your voices heard about people copying your project. ",
