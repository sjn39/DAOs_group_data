Specifically to this MIP, I\u2019m curious why choose Keep3r Network? It\u2019s nice that they\u2019re doing pro-bono work, but I haven\u2019t seen their performance outside of Andre\u2019s own projects. On that note, Andre\u2019s recent close partnerships with Daniele Sestagalli have me concerned because the Abracadabra community has been hostile towards MakerDAO. I\u2019m not a fan of them actively cheering for our downfall and saying they\u2019ll replace us through things like byebyedai.money. I\u2019m honestly not sure where his fleeting loyalty lies, along with his supporters. ",

The nice thing about MIP63 is that this is built for redundancy. If one network misbehaves then the other networks will take over to fill their duties. If they do not resolve their issues we can give them the boot. Basically this means that a single misbehaving network does not threaten the security of the keeper network so long as we resolve things in a reasonable time frame. So really we should be adding any service as long as they are not complete scams or something. ",

In this case, have you or the PECU taken a look at Chainlink\u2019s Keepers? I learned about it by trying options on Premia, which did a good job automatically exercising my expired OTM options. I quickly reviewed the Keeper docs, and it looks like it\u2019s permissionless to register, which, if I\u2019m not mistaken, would fit nicely into our new MIP63 architecture as you described. The pricing is also in the docs to help determine the funding needed for a backup Keeper. There\u2019s also OpenZeppelin Defender, which I don\u2019t know much about, but they advertise it as \u201cfree*\u201d. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some upcharge plan, but it still might work for us as a backup. I\u2019d say both of those are reputable companies and not scams. I could submit these as MIP-63c4-SP4 and MIP-63c4-SP5, respectively, but I\u2019d like to have the PECU\u2019s expertise and input first  ",
