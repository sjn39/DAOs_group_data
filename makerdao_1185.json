                    "content": "Cabot Renewable Energy Key Terms, Structured Transaction Review, and Risk Assessment Introduction Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC (\u201cCabot\u201d) is wholly owned by Exos Capital LLC (\u201cExos Capital\u201d). Exos Capital is an affiliate of Exos TFP Holdings LLC (including its affiliates, \u201cExos\u201d). Exos was founded in 2017, and detailed information about Exos is available below and at https://www.exosfinancial.com/. Cabot will acquire and control approximately 3,000 Bitcoin mining machines to be co-located with other Exos crypto miners in Paraguay. Exos\u2019s purpose-built facility in Paraguay has direct access to renewable hydroelectric power making the facility both carbon neutral and highly cost-effective. Exos has been relocating existing miners from North America to Paraguay, and the Cabot proposal is an expansion of the mining capacity at this facility. Exos seeks to work with MakerDAO to expand and further decentralize cryptocurrency mining activities in a manner which is both cost-effective and environmentally sustainable. As detailed below, Exos seeks to narrow and prewire most aspects of the transaction to reduce MakerDAO\u2019s operational, monitoring, and build-out requirements. In particular, (x) Cabot will be organized as a limited purpose LLC domiciled in the U.S., (y) Exos Capital will pledge its interest in Cabot to MakerDAO (or its designee), and (z) mining machine valuations will be preset based on a 5-year final life. The following content is intended to supplement and clarify the \u201cMIP6: Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining\u201d collateral onboarding submission of June 2, 2022 on the MakerDAO Forum, consistent with MakerDAO\u2019s MIP67 and related guidance. Definitions and terms should be assumed to be consistent unless otherwise indicated. Transaction Overview An equivalent dollar value of $15 million of Cabot-owned machines will serve as the collateral for the proposed DAI amount of $12 million (i.e., an initial 80% collateral value). Collateral will be returned in equal installments over four years (the \u201cProject Term\u201d). For the purposes of the project, Cabot assumes that the collateral value of the machines will decline linearly by $3 million per year (20% of the original valuation) over each year of the Project Term, and Exos Capital\u2019s $3 million contribution will remain subordinated to MakerDAO\u2019s interest throughout the Project Term. Loan-to-values (\u201cLTVs\u201d) based on straight-line re-valuation of the collateral are projected as 75%, 66%, 50%, and 0% for MakerDAO on each anniversary of commencement of the Project as collateral is returned. For the purposes of collateral return and collateral valuations, the Project Term has a half-life of two-years, and the machines are assumed to have a half-life of 2 \u00bd years. The Cabot machines will be part of Exos\u2019s larger hydro-powered operation in Paraguay. Cabot will be organized as a limited purpose LLC organized in Delaware, and Cabot will maintain independent partners with services available in both the U.S. and Paraguay to assist with operational and logistical support. As detailed below, Cabot will fund a wallet for the purpose of covering the operational set-up, shipping, transfer, or liquidation of Cabot\u2019s miners in the remote event that MakerDAO acquires control of Cabot and its assets as a result of a collateral recovery or liquidation event. Cabot will be formed and organized prior to a final approval of the proposal. As discussed above, Cabot will operate as a limited purpose entity, organized solely for the purposes of collateral isolation and management. For the avoidance of doubt, Cabot will be restricted from activities not related to acquiring the miners, operating and maintaining its miners, and causing the payment of yield and return of collateral to MakerDAO (\u201cLimited Activities\u201d). Cabot\u2019s is restricted from borrowings or other indebtedness not in direct support of the Limited Activities. The credit support for the transaction will be a pledge of Exos\u2019 equity interests in Cabot, as described in [Q36] of Cabot\u2019s MIP6 proposal: \u201cTo ensure that MakerDAO has access to the collateral, Exos Capital will pledge its equity interests in Cabot to MakerDAO, which, at the direction of MakerDAO, may necessitate the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code naming MakerDAO or its designee as \u201csecured party\u201d. Exos will serve as the \u201cOperator\u201d of Cabot\u2019s Bitcoin mining assets. Exos anticipates performing the operational, settlement and day-to-day work with its in-house staff, drawing from its trading, operations, accounting/reporting, legal, and compliance personnel. As of June 30, 2022, Exos and its affiliates have more than 80 professionals worldwide. Key Transaction Terms  image1127\u00d71281 92 KB   Subject to market conditions, Exos can assist MakerDAO-MIP6 in identifying similar collateralization arrangements with other parties in other mining locations  Scheduled Valuations, Exchanges, and Cash Flows The table provided below illustrates the preset collateral valuations, returns of collateral, yield on outstanding collateral amounts, and MakerDAO credit support. As depicted in column \u201cMiner Machine PreSet Val. Schedule\u201d, for the purposes of both return of collateral and collateral support, machines will be valued with a 2.5yr half-life with straight-line preset value depreciation over 5 years; 5 years is consistent with industry consensus. Because the project term is 4 years, the original subordinated amount is retained throughout the life of the Project Term. Column \u201cDAI Collateral Return\u201d indicates the scheduled return of collateral. Annually, Cabot is obligated to cause Exos Cap to return the full amount of the preset collateral decline per year ($3m Dai) in addition to the interest payments illustrated in column \u201c6.00% Interest Payments\u201d. In addition to the transaction being de-risked through both preset collateral valuations and annual returns of collateral, the credit support to MakerDAO increases over the Project Term as measured with reference to both the original investment amount (\u201cInvested Amt Coverage Ratio\u201d) and the preset valuation (\u201cPreset Decline Coverage Ratio\u201d).  image716\u00d7143 13.5 KB  Transaction Detail Figure Time_1 Exos Capital, Cabot, and MakerDAO will execute the tri-party transaction depicted in Figure Time_1 where (1) Exos Capital contributes $3 million to Cabot, and (2) MakerDAO delivers 12 million Dai to Cabot in exchange for a contractual pledge over Cabot from Exos Capital (or at MakerDAO\u2019s election, a designee to take delivery of the equity pledge).  Figure Time_2 Following Figure Time_1, Cabot will acquire miners for cash, and miner acquisitions will be recorded on-chain with identifying collateral detail and the related return-of-collateral schedules. Beginning at (Figure Time_2) Step 1, Cabot will exchange Dai amounts for US dollars, in stages, in an aggregate amount of Dai 12 million. US dollar proceeds will be used to purchase mining machines. Moving to (Figure Time_2) Step 2, Cabot will purchase machines from vendors in one or more individual orders and transactions; mining machine orders will be grouped, staged and staggered based on market conditions and availability.  The composition of the mining machines will be subject to market conditions and will be approximately 3,000 Micro BT M30S+ machines (~95 Ths, 3,327W), or equivalent, with an acquisition value of at least $15 million U.S. dollars. Cabot assets will be comprised of: (a) a wallet for Dai (for both initial Dai and Dai repayments), (b) the mining machines, (c) NFTs which will serve solely as on-chain recording of each DAI-for-machine deployment and each DAI collateral return, and (d) the Unwind Expenses Wallet \u2013 see Figure Time_3 below. Cabot will record the deployment of DAI-for-miners on-chain through the minting of NFTs (Figure Time_2, Step 4). For simplicity, we have indicated that the NFTs are held by Cabot, but they could also be held by MakerDAO or a designee if MakerDAO prefers that arrangement. While the NFTs are not critical to success of the project or the return of collateral, the NFTs minted and burned to track to DAI deployments and DAI returns will conform with the ERC-721 standard and will be used solely for the purpose of on-chain recording. Moving to (Figure Time_2) Step 3, Exos\u2019s capital is in the form of U.S. dollars or mining machines pending delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, all US $15 million in machines will be recorded on-chain, but the subordinated amount ($3 million of the $15 million mining machines) representing Exos\u2019 equity in the project will be recorded on-chain without return of collateral details; this $3 million amount serves as \u201cfailure-to-return-collateral\u201d credit enhancement, but is not subject to repayment under ordinary circumstances. Figure Time_2, Step 4 indicates the on-chain recording of Dai-for-machines and is detailed below in Figure Time_2\u2019.  Figure Time_2\u2019 Concurrent with the delivery of mining machines, Cabot will cause on-chain recording through NFTs which will contain a listing of the individual machines and the corresponding Dai repayment schedule. As indicated at (Figure Time_2\u2019) \u201cC\u201d, recording will include dates, machine detail (e.g. manufacturer, serial number, make and model) and return of collateral detail. Since repayment will occur over four years, each Dai-for-miner deployment will be recorded as 4 NFTs (e.g., NFT N_1, N_2, N_3, and N_4) where \u201cN\u201d is the deployment identifier, and 1 through 4 indicate the annual DAI repayment obligation. Accordingly, the first deployment of Dai-for-miners is recorded as \u201cNFT 1_1\u201d, \u201cNFT 1_2\u201d, \u201cNFT 1_3\u201d and \u201cNFT 1_4\u201d and the nth deployment will be recorded as \u201cNFT N_[1-4]\u201d). As noted above, there are expected to be a number of deployments as the miners are expected to be purchased in a number of separate transactions. Following each annual collateral return, the corresponding NFTs will be burned (see Figure Time_2\u2019, \u201cB\u201d in diagram below).  Figure Time_3 To cover expenses associated with an unexpected liquidation of Cabot and/or the mining machines, Cabot will cause Exos Capital to deposit the first $250,000 of mining revenues generated by Cabot\u2019s miners in a wallet held at Cabot (the \u201cUnwind Expenses Wallet\u201d \u2013 see Figure Time_3, Step 1). Generally, mining revenue in excess of $250,000 (plus/minus true-ups) will be remitted to Exos Capital \u2013 see Figure Time_3, Step 1. The Unwind Expenses Wallet will hold approximately $250,000 in value, which may be a combination of cryptocurrency generated by the miners and stable coins including Dai. In the event that the value of the Unwind Expenses Wallet falls below $250,000, Cabot will cause Exos Capital to add additional amounts to the wallet in quarterly true-ups. Similarly, when the value of the Unwind Expenses Wallet exceeds $250,000, Cabot will cause Exos Capital to transfer the excess to Exos Capital. The Unwind Expenses Wallet will be assessed and, if needed, cured for any true-ups on a quarterly basis. The funds held in the Unwind Expenses Wallet are available to pay for the costs of liquidation of the collateral as detailed below. When Dai 12 million collateral (plus the collateral yield) has been fully returned, any claims MakerDAO may have over the equity interests of Cabot, including any claim to the miners and any amounts held at Cabot, including the Unwind Expenses Wallet, are extinguished.  Figure Time_4 The return of collateral is scheduled to occur in equal installments on each anniversary. On each of the four Project Term anniversaries, Cabot will direct Exos Capital to return 25% of the original collateral amount (Dai 3 million) plus the yield amount for the period (Figure Time_4, Step 1). Concurrently, Dai 3 million plus the yield amount will be returned to MakerDAO (Figure Time_4, Step 1\u2019) and Cabot will cause the related NFT(s), which recorded the scheduled return of collateral, to be burned (Figure Time_4, Step 1\u2019\u2019).  The Sponsor and Manager - Exos Capital Headquartered in New York City, Exos conducts diversified financial services and trading activities globally. Exos employs more than 80 professionals around the world including trading, banking, strategy, legal, compliance, and technology teams. Exos operates in a range of businesses and markets including in securities trading, commercial finance, asset management, alternative investments, technology ventures, and digital assets. Exos also operates world leading businesses and teams in AI (artificial intelligence), NLP (natural language processing) and other advanced data and computer sciences areas through its Claira team (link) and its newly acquired Pluribus Labs team (link). Exos operates both a registered broker-dealer and a registered investment advisor in the U.S. Detailed information on beneficial ownership, governance/control, and key personnel is available in Exos\u2019 Form ADV SEC filing (Form ADV 2) that is filed for the registered investment advisor, Exos Asset Management. Similarly, for the recently acquired Pluribus Labs LLC, more detailed information on beneficial ownership, governance/control etc. available in their Form ADV SEC filing (Form ADV Pluribus ). Exos was formed in 2017 and is led by Brady Dougan, formally Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Credit Suisse. The following diagram is an organizational chart of Exos and its affiliates.  image1868\u00d71049 52.2 KB  Operational and Local Partners Exos retains two partners relating to its mining operations for logistical, administration and on-site support: Navier, Inc. (link) and DeltaMining (link). Cabot is in the process of arranging for Navier, a mining operator, to provide operational oversight, security, and surveillance of the facility. While Navier is expected to provide these services for the foreseeable future, Exos reserves the right to replace Navier with a service provider who will provide equivalent services. In the event of a failure to return collateral under the Project terms, Navier will facilitate access to and liquidation of the Cabot miners. Alternatively, MakerDAO can designate an alternative agent to act as its service provider to facilitate the liquidation of collateral. While Cabot and Exos\u2019 partners may change over the life of the project, Cabot will maintain at least one independent partner with a working knowledge of the Paraguay mining site who is capable of assisting a MakerDAO auction, sale, transport, or operational transition of Cabot\u2019s miners in the unexpected event that Dai collateral is not returned under the terms of the transaction. Key Risk Factors and Risk Mitigation The principal risk of the Project is a failure by Cabot to return the collateral. The proposed transaction is arranged and structured to reduce the complexity of a collateral recovery while providing a range of recovery alternatives, as further discussed below. While not exhaustive, the following steps and alternatives to recovery are contemplated for the transaction:  image1127\u00d7519 53.3 KB  A second-order risk is a decrease in the value of the mining machines which proves more rapid than the preset valuation declines. While miners can have a useful life well in excess of 5 years, the project is assuming a full useful live of 5 years, a scheduled project termination at year 4, and a collateral half-life (return) of 2 years based on the annual returns of Dai. On the first anniversary, the scheduled return of Dai 3 million is based on a preset machine valuation decline of 20%: assumed aggregate machine valuation is revised from 15m to 12m, and the outstanding Dai is revised from 12m to 9m. If prevailing collateral valuations reflect an additional 20% decline (i.e. 40% in year 1, where [0.60 x 15m] now covers 9m) an impermanent loss may occur. Similarly on the second anniversary, the scheduled return of Dai 3 million is based on a preset machine valuation decline of $3m or 25% (i.e. $3m/12m or 25%). If prevailing collateral valuations reflect an additional 25% (50% in year 2, where [0.5 x 12m] now covers 6m) an impermanent loss may occur. In order to facilitate total transparency to Cabot\u2019s operations, Exos and Cabot will provide real-time monitoring including (1) public wallet addresses to observe the holdings and transactions of wallets held at Cabot (2) real-time 24/7 webcams on the physical machines (3) and real-time dashboard indicating which machines are on site. For completeness, we repeat the risks considerations outlined in Q36 of our MIP6 proposal below: The primary risk of the proposal is that collateral is not returned and the risk mitigation measures are insufficient to result in a full return of the collateral and payment of the expected yield. Competition: Cabot\u2019s obligations to MakerDAO are not reliant on the success of either Cabot or Exos generating any particular level of market share, business activity, or asset-based returns. That said, it is possible that overall lower levels of activity in Bitcoin mining and price levels (including in respect of other cryptocurrencies) could adversely impact the value of the mining machines and the associated mining revenue the project generates. General Industry Risks: An early and rapid decline in the value of mining machines and simultaneous failure of Cabot to return collateral could leave MakerDAO less well collateralized. To mitigate these risks, Exos has made its equity fully subordinated to the MakerDAO collateral return, and the preset annual returns of collateral progressively de-risk MakerDAO\u2019s exposure. Legal and Regulatory Risks: Bitcoin has enjoyed a unique regulatory position relative to other coins and tokens; we do not expect its regulatory characterization to change. However, there is always the risk that regulators may assert broader jurisdiction over Bitcoin and, in particular, transactions effected on MakerDAO, including the issuance of DAI. We also do not expect there to by any regulatory changes that would materially impact the operation of the machines. That said, it is possible that regulatory changes could materially impact the profitability of the machines or ability to operate the machines, in which case they could be moved to one or more alternative countries with a more favorable regulatory regime in the event of unexpected legal or regulatory developments within the original host country. Interest Rate Risk: Unlike a conventional borrowing arrangement, annual preset returns of DAI collateral reduce the interest rate risk. For example, on the second anniversary, only one-half of the DAI collateral remains outstanding and subject to rises in interest rates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, borrowing at a fixed rate opposed to a variable rate can expose the lender to additional interest rate risk if interest rates increase. Commercial and Market Risks: It is possible that market conditions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could negatively impact the profitability of this project. Further, if the market for mining machines drops dramatically early in the Project Term, the support provided by the subordinated equity will be diminished due to adverse changes to machine prices. Execution & Operating Related Risks: Our results of operations, including the levels of the project\u2019s net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our annual financial results include:   (i) the amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure;   (ii) fluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and   (iii) general economic, industry and market conditions.   Illiquidity Risks: The Collateral or the tokens evidencing rights to the Collateral may be or become illiquid which may affect MakerDAO\u2019s ability to exit such asset. Cyber-Related Risks: Cabot and its Operator, Exos Capital, and their third-party service providers are subject to risks associated with \u201ccybersecurity\u201d breaches. \u201cCybersecurity\u201d is a generic term used to describe the technology, processes and practices designed to protect networks, systems, computers, programs and data from unauthorized access or manipulation by other computer users and the efforts to avoid the resulting damage and disruption of hardware and software systems, loss or corruption of data and/or misappropriation of confidential information. Cybersecurity breaches may be the result of intentional actions (such as an attempt by a third party to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to Cabot, Exos data) or unintentional events. Any such breach could expose the arrangement to financial loss (including those associated with the forensic analysis of the origin and scope of the breach and costs of increased and upgraded information technology systems and/or cybersecurity countermeasures), the disruption of business, unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation, the dissemination of confidential and proprietary information or reputational damage. Disruptions in the market for DAI and the Ethereum blockchain: can alter the timing of collateral returns. In the event that transactions to either acquire or transmit DAI are subject to disruption (a \u201cMarket Disruption\u201d), Exos will notify MakerDAO of such disruption via the MakerDAO forum or alternative means. A Market Disruption means any of:   (i) transactions submitted to the Ethereum blockchain are materially delayed or failing,   (ii) the MakerDAO protocol is reported to be down or inoperative,   (iii) gas prices for a transaction on the Ethereum network exceed the equivalent of $200, as reported by Etherscan.io or a similar data source,   (iv) Exos is unable to acquire DAI for 1.00 US dollar (taking into consideration all historically consistent transaction costs).   Cabot reserves the right to delay the return of collateral and other payment obligations during a Market Disruption until such time such Market Disruption is remedied or no longer occurring. In the event that the Market Disruption (iv) is continuing for more than 90 calendar days, Cabot will convert Dai quantities to U.S. Dollars and remit a market equivalent amount of said U.S. Dollars in Ether. COUNTRY RISK As described herein, Cabot\u2019s operations and machines are expected to be located in Paraguay during the Project Term. While there is no certainty relating to national laws or regulation, Cabot\u2019s assets relate to the mining machines and not the physical site, and in the event of unexpected changes, Cabot\u2019s machines may be relocated outside Paraguay. Nonetheless, recent industry articles have reported a generally constructive national view of cryptocurrencies and mining activities. Neither Cabot nor Exos are representing any view relating to the regulatory environment in Paraguay or any other country. See \u201cParaguayan Bill Regulating Crypto Mining and Trading Moves Closer to Law\u201d, Coindesk, Andres Engler, May 25, 2022 (link). From the article:  \u201cParaguay\u2019s Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved by a 40-12 vote a bill regulating crypto mining and trading. The country\u2019s Senate in December had already passed similar legislation, and the bill will now return to that body with the Chamber of Deputies\u2019 modifications. Once the Senate approves the changes, the pending law would move to the executive branch, which hasn\u2019t yet signaled whether it will sign or veto. Speaking with CoinDesk last year, Carlos Rejala \u2013 one of the bill\u2019s authors \u2013 said the legislation aims to attract international miners to Paraguay, which has one of the lowest electricity rates in Latin America at around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. In the debate, Congressman Tadeo Rojas (ANR-Central) argued against the legislation, noting that the Chamber of Deputies\u2019 budget committee recommended rejection. He added the impact on job creation is low compared with the energy consumption required by mining companies. In favor of the proposal, Congressman Sebasti\u00e1n Garc\u00eda (PPQ-Capital) said the bill sets ceilings so that energy consumption is in line with availability.\u201d  DISCLAIMER This document has been prepared by Cabot Renewable Crypto Mining LLC (\u201cCabot\u201d), a subsidiary of Exos TFP Holdings LLC, exclusively for the benefit of MakerDAO.

                    "content": "The incubating Legal & Transactional Services core unit (\u201cLTS\u201d) has reviewed the Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining (MIP6 Follow On). Recommendation: LTS recommends that the Maker DAO community not greenlight this application. Rationale The MIP67/MIP6 application remains incomplete and leaves out important commercial and legal details. Exos Capital has not proposed a mechanism for Maker to integrate in the real world in respect of the loan or the proposed security interest over the mining machines. Exos Capital appears to leave this decision with the Maker community. Exos indicates that Cabot will own the mining machines. What is unclear from the proposal is whether Cabot (the Delaware entity) or another entity (a Cabot affiliate in Paraguay) will actually have ownership of the mining assets in Paraguay. It is not uncommon for a US entity to form a subsidiary in the local jurisdiction to own and operate the locally-based assets. Maker would not have direct access to the mining equipment itself as collateral security. This weakens the security package. Although I recognize that the membership interests in Cabot will likely be easier to foreclose. An \u201call assets\u201d security in regards to Cabot would be appropriate. The security interest would include the \u201cUnwind Expenses Wallet\u201d and the agreements under which Cabot acquires the mining machines. Without a doubt, any action to remove the machines from Paraguay will require some level of activity in Paraguay. Exos has not provided any direct visibility on the agreements for the operational, settlement, etc. of the mining machines. As a secured party, Maker will want to ensure that, in the event that it exercises its collateral rights, it will have the necessary contracts to ensure the on-going operation and/or removal of the machines. Exos has not provided an over-arching funds flow diagram that describes each step of the funding and repayment process. The mechanism to activate the assets in the Unwind Expenses Wallet is not clear. If Cabot has an obligation to pay Maker from this wallet and does not, what happens? What is Maker\u2019s recourse? The proposal requires due diligence of Exos\u2019 larger \u201chydro-powered operation\u201d in Paraguay. For instance, if there is a temporary shortage of hydroelectric power (irrespective of the reason), how will Exos prioritize its mining machines? Are all of Exos\u2019 machines curtailed on a pro rata basis? What happens if there is an insurable event in respect of the financed mining machines \u2013 does Cabot repay the loan immediately? How has Cabot arranged for its insurance coverage? Other than briefly, Exos has not addressed any potential political risk issues in Paraguay, particularly in respect of expropriation, permitting and the like. While an interesting proposition to marry DAI with Bitcoin mining, the proposed transaction has many of the features of a single-asset, project financing. The proposed transaction will require, in my view as an experienced project finance lawyer, substantial time for LTS and @Real-World-Finance to identify and mitigate the project associated risks and bring a transaction to fruition.

                    "content": "Maker Community Subject Matter Expertise & Embedded Optionality in Unexpected Recovery Scenario Based on the community\u2019s subject matter expertise and expected expansion of MakerDAO\u2019s real world activities, Exos believes that it\u2019s suboptimal to prewire a single recovery mechanism which would automatically trigger an auctioning, other selling, or miner operation without consideration of prevailing market conditions or potential real world finance synergies. Exos believes that providing agents and service providers throughout the term (rather than hard-wired liquidations) is likely to preserve beneficial options and reduce the possibilities for conflicts of interest.     CabotRenewableTeam:     The embedded optionality prescribed in this proposal provides MakerDAO with assurances, that in the unlikely event of default, the Maker Community can take comfort in the fact that Cabot assets can integrate with whatever strategy MakerDAO elects to pursuit within the crypto mining asset class. It is with care that we propose four clearly defined liquidation routes, opposed to one that is hard-wired and lacking in strategic considerations.    MIP6: Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining   So as I think about moving into this asset class. The logic is not: because the value of our collateral (ASICs, land, PPE, PPAs) will fall with BTC, an asset Maker is already exposed to, we should avoid it. But rather, is this an asset that Maker can have an EDGE in understanding and lending against. Most of our RWAs thus far have been imported from competitive TradFi markets. We should be thinking: what sorts of assets are UNIQUELY fitted to Maker lending rails?   To the point @teej raised in our original MIP6 (and quoted here), while we do not presently know Maker\u2019s \u201cEDGE,\u201d we do know that MakerDAO will have an EDGE when/if it chooses to deepen its ties to the crypto mining asset class. The remedy herein preserves that flexibility as MakerDAO\u2019s strategy within the asset class continues to evolve. Complete Security Package Consistent with the proposal, closing documentation would encompass a \u201ccomplete security\u201d package; Cabot owns all of the collateral including the machines and Unwind Expenses Wallet, and MakerDAO would have a pledge of Cabot and ownership of Cabot in the unlikely event of default. From the proposal-     CabotRenewableTeam:  Cabot will acquire and control approximately 3,000 Bitcoin mining machines to be co-located with other Exos crypto miners in Paraguay.       CabotRenewableTeam:  Cabot assets will be comprised of: (a) a wallet for Dai (for both initial Dai and Dai repayments), (b) the mining machines, (c) NFTs which will serve solely as on-chain recording of each DAI-for-machine deployment and each DAI collateral return, and (d) the Unwind Expenses Wallet \u2013 see Figure Time_3 below.   and     CabotRenewableTeam:  The credit support for the transaction will be a pledge of Exos\u2019 equity interests in Cabot, as described in [Q36] of Cabot\u2019s MIP6 proposal: \u201cTo ensure that MakerDAO has access to the collateral, Exos Capital will pledge its equity interests in Cabot to MakerDAO, which, at the direction of MakerDAO, may necessitate the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code naming MakerDAO or its designee as \u201csecured party\u201d.   Over-arching Fund Flow Diagram For clarity, diagram #1 illustrates the initial exchange of collateral and funds,     CabotRenewableTeam:     diagram #2 illustrates the deployment of funds including Dai     CabotRenewableTeam:     and diagram #4 illustrates the repayment.     CabotRenewableTeam:     Note on Closing Documents More Broadly Many of the points mentioned in this assessment will be easily clarified upon execution of legal documents. The Cabot team has considerable legal, financial, and technical resources at it\u2019s disposal to facilitate this process. We\u2019re also open-minded and sympathetic to the nuances in completing a first of its kind transaction with MakerDAO as it relates to crypto mining assets. We are grateful for the Core Unit Facilitator\u2019s time in reviewing our application and remain steadfast in our commitment to moving forward with a resolution. ",

I agree with @teej from a strategic perspective. And the Maker community\u2019s adoption of a strategic preference may include the assumption of certain legal and contractual risks. The Maker community needs to simply understand whether it is (or is not) assuming certain legal and contractual risks.     CabotRenewableTeam:  closing documentation would encompass a \u201ccomplete security\u201d package   What is a \u201ccomplete security\u201d package? As a project finance lawyer, my view of \u201ccomplete\u201d is a security interest in the equity of the borrower (Cabot), the underlying assets (the mining machines), Cabot\u2019s contractual rights, and any other asset of Cabot. Even though Cabot may own the machines, as a secured party, I will want to ensure that no other person could have a priority security interest in the machines themselves. A security interest in Cabot\u2019s equity does not guarantee this protection. I appreciate the basic funds flow. But there are outstanding questions - who is the proposed exchange agent? Does Cabot or Exos have the contractual relationship with the exchange agent? If Exos, how do you propose that Maker steps into Cabot\u2019s shoes to access USD/DAI conversion in the event Maker exercises its security interest in the Cabot shares? I am not an expert in the mining process, but who receives the mining rewards - is it Cabot or Exos?     CabotRenewableTeam:  Many of the points mentioned in this assessment will be easily clarified upon execution of legal documents.   I appreciate that the legal documents will clarify many of my questions. However, the purpose of this exercise is to clarify some of those basic questions now so that the Maker community has a better picture of what will be required to execute a transaction before MKR token holders vote.     CabotRenewableTeam:  We\u2019re also open-minded and sympathetic to the nuances in completing a first of its kind transaction with MakerDAO as it relates to crypto mining assets.   Thank you and I agree that crypto mining assets may be a first. However, this is a straightforward project financing where the repayment of the indebtedness is wholly dependent on the cash flow from the assets and, in the worst case, liquidation of the assets.

                    "content": "Cabot, some questions prior to my issuance of a Greenlight recommendation:      CabotRenewableTeam:  Exos operates in a range of businesses and markets including in securities trading, commercial finance, asset management, alternative investments, technology ventures, and digital assets. Exos also operates world leading businesses and teams in AI (artificial intelligence), NLP (natural language processing) and other advanced data and computer sciences areas through its Claira team (link) and its newly acquired Pluribus Labs team (link).   1. Experience: It seems like Exos has its hands in a lot of pots, a fox rather than a hedgehog. I recognize that Exos serves as the manager for Morgan Creek-Exos Risk Managed Bitcoin Fund, though I thought it was odd that this was not mentioned. Can you confirm for how long Exos or Cabot itself (directly, not through external partners like Navier/Deltamining) have been actively mining Bitcoin? How long has Exos or Cabot itself been operating ASIC operations in Paraguay?     CabotRenewableTeam:  An equivalent dollar value of $15 million of Cabot-owned machines will serve as the collateral for the proposed DAI amount of $12 million (i.e., an initial 80% collateral value). Collateral will be returned in equal installments over four years (the \u201cProject Term\u201d).   2. LTV: So the lender\u2019s attachment point against the asset is 80%, correct? i.e. MakerDAO\u2019s all-in LTV is 80% against the machines (really Cabot equity which owns the machines but let\u2019s keep it simple)? Then we can incorporate the $250K of cash trapped for \u201cUnwind Expenses\u201d as additional credit enhancement. Should your depreciation (5-year straight-line as per standard US GAAP) schedule be incorrect, it\u2019d only take an incremental 20% of depreciation to put our loan underwater. So our 80% LTV loan is contingent upon there not being unforeseen technological advancement in mining equipment, correct? In your professional experience is it market standard that a senior lender to miners underwrite at 80% all-in LTV against the physical assets? Same question wrt to rate\u2026is 6% market for senior secured leverage?  Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 10.18.05 AM1040\u00d7102 37.3 KB  3. Senior Secured or? As contemplated, Maker\u2019s security interest is in the shares of Cabot as opposed to the M30s themselves, as @christiancdpetersen highlighted in his review. In this case, other indebtedness could be incurred on the machines, other PPE, or unencumbered power generation, or hosting revenue, correct? As your group will hopefully know well, Maker is positioned as a senior secured lender. Does this opportunity in fact fit that bill?    MIP6: Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining   Prior to the next halving, we forecast a breakeven price of BTC of approximately 16,000. After the next halving, assuming BTC price remains at current levels until then, the breakeven price is approximately 25,500.   4. Mining Economics: In a previous post (pasted above), we discussed how Cabot\u2019s operation breaks even at $16K BTC pre-halving and $25.5K post halving. Compared to large miners like Riot, Marathon, and Core Scientific, this represents quite an an efficient operation. This efficiency will be driven by a few factors of course\u2014let\u2019s focus on two: (A) energy cost and (B) The M30s A. What is the meter rate for the geothermal source in Paraguay? (Apologies if this was answered, typing this on my phone) B. The 3,000 M30s have not yet been ordered\u2014this is what the proceeds of a prospective loan from Maker would be used for. Is this break-even BTC quoted contingent upon the delivery, installment, and incorporation of the new machines? Or does this break-even describe the Paraguay facility as is? What model rigs are currently installed and cash-flowing at Exos\u2019 operation in Paraguay? If the break-even does incorporate the new machines, have the machines already been ordered? What is the lead time on delivery?  Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 10.29.12 AM1394\u00d7518 43.1 KB  5. Size: What is the total size of Exos/Cabot\u2019s mining operations at this moment? How many machines total? Hashrate? (May have been answered) How much BTC mined on a T-12 basis? Thanks very much for answering my questions and for the thoughtful proposal.

Definitely not a straight forward exercise to parse the what, who and how of a structure that can give MakerDAO the right exposure here, but we should absolutely figure it out and, fortunately, have a cracker-jack team in place to help us!

Our exposure should be money good in a bear case.   Even though Exos Capital uses a five-year (full) lifespan assumption for the newly acquired miners, we\u2019ve structured the MakerDAO exposure to have a weighted average life of two years and a final term of four. As depicted below, where $15 million of newly acquired miners are prospectively valued with a $3 million drop-per-year, 50% of the MakerDAO amounts are returned by year two, and 100% of the MakerDAO amounts are returned by year four.  On Miner lifespans and depreciation, we further recommend separating financial reporting from real world or technical use. For finances and tax accounting, public companies, depending upon their country of organization, will generally adopt the fastest reportable depreciation for capital investments, including any available front-loaded or accelerated depreciation. Obviously faster front-loaded depreciation of capital investments will have the general effect of reducing tax liabilities, boosting net income, and increasing shareholder enterprise value. In our Q36 proposal we cited a number of sources directed at the technical lifespans which are more consistent with experience and that of our partners which do not take into consideration possible fiscal reporting objectives.

                    "content": "Appreciate the patience @teej, see below:     teej:  1. Experience: It seems like Exos has its hands in a lot of pots, a fox rather than a hedgehog. I recognize that Exos serves as the manager for Morgan Creek-Exos Risk Managed Bitcoin Fund, though I thought it was odd that this was not mentioned. Can you confirm for how long Exos or Cabot itself (directly, not through external partners like Navier/Deltamining) have been actively mining Bitcoin? How long has Exos or Cabot itself been operating ASIC operations in Paraguay?   Exos started mining in 2019 and has in-depth experience with managing mining operations over various and different regimes (e.g., crypto winter, etc) for the past 3.5 years, which is a pretty long track record in this business. We have placed miners in multiple hosting sites in North America, including Kentucky, North Carolina, Washington, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin and in British Columbia over various time periods. In each location, we were able to negotiate lucrative contracts to ensure that our mining operations remain profitable even in times of stress. We are currently in the process of consolidating all of these mining operations in Paraguay. We have owned and managed primarily two types of miners up to now: A9s and Spondoolies SPX36. The A9s were used to mine Zen and Zcash, while the Spondoolies were used to mine primarily Dash. The relocation to Paraguay will be our first deployment of dedicated BTC miners, and while we have never directly mined BTC, the value mined has typically run about $1mm/month when our operations were active. As of today, we have 2,236 A9s and 1,239 SPX36s for a total 3,475 machines. When we had written the MIP6 back in early June, in question #3 we had noted that:    MIP6: Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining   Critically, for knowledge of MakerDAO and members of the forum, the financing referenced in Question #2 and to which this application corresponds, will support the expansion of Exos\u2019 existing mining operations that have been successful and on-going since 2019. Currently, our initial shipment of 1,500 mining machines, which are not connected to this financing, will arrive in Paraguay by ocean liner in approximately 90 days. As it relates to the purchase of 3,000 MicroBT M30S+* mining machines, we believe it will take us 90 days to purchase, transport, and \u201cplug-in\u201d the machines from the time our application for Collateral Onboarding is approved by the MakerDAO community. Exos and its affiliates have been developing plans to shift the totality of their mining business to South America since late 2021. Since then, the Operator has worked with local contractors, developers, and other third-parties to secure the agreements necessary to begin operations.   *In the original MIP6 I had incorrectly type Micro BT M30, for clarity, our intention is to purchase Micro BT M30S+ As of today, our initial shipment of 1,500 machines arrived in Paraguay from British Columbia, and are in transit to our mining location. We expect the remaining machines to be delivered within the next 30 days, consistent with the \u201capproximately 90 days\u201d we had suggested at outset of our MIP6 application. Exos has also deployed third-party funds in miners and has developed advanced monitoring and management techniques and sophisticated monetization algorithms. In addition, as you noted, we have a franchise in algorithmic trading in crypto as well as facilitation lending, and we\u2019re currently working on a structured note investment that references the price of Bitcoin, which we believe will be a first of its kind. The product you spoke to, the Morgan Creek-Exos Risk Managed Bitcoin Fund, is only eligible for accredited investors and we did not want to be perceived as if we were advertising that product on this forum - though we are very proud of it, and its performance.     teej:  2. LTV: So the lender\u2019s attachment point against the asset is 80%, correct? i.e. MakerDAO\u2019s all-in LTV is 80% against the machines (really Cabot equity which owns the machines but let\u2019s keep it simple)? Then we can incorporate the $250K of cash trapped for \u201cUnwind Expenses\u201d as additional credit enhancement. Should your depreciation (5-year straight-line as per standard US GAAP) schedule be incorrect, it\u2019d only take an incremental 20% of depreciation to put our loan underwater. So our 80% LTV loan is contingent upon there not being unforeseen technological advancement in mining equipment, correct?   First, it\u2019s important to note that although the starting loan-to-value (LTV) is 80%, we commit to return 25% of the borrowed amount each year until the loan is fully paid off in year 4. So the loan will be only 60% of the initial purchase price as of the first anniversary and 40% as of the second. The market price of the machines can fall rapidly and nevertheless we can still maintain a favorable LTV. More importantly, given the nature of our mining operation, we do not think the mark-to-market value of the machines is especially relevant once we start mining. As discussed, we think of this business as manufacturing \u2013 we make bitcoins \u2013 and as a structurally-advantaged investment in bitcoin. We think crypto in general, and bitcoin in particular, will continue to be relevant for a long time and that manufacturing it will continue to be very profitable, regardless of short-term fluctuations in the price of bitcoin or of machines. For example, the recent decline in BTC has indeed moved machine pricing lower, which lowers our cost to mine each bitcoin and therefore makes this trade even more profitable (especially if you\u2019re bullish on crypto, as we are). But even if we had purchased the machines at the higher valuations prevailing a few months ago, the business would have been profitable and able to service the debt and return principal according to the 4-year schedule. It helps to think of this financing in terms of an operating business that manufactures an essential and relevant product, that generates revenues and earnings from that manufacturing process, and has an eye towards growth and expansion in the future.     teej:  In your professional experience is it market standard that a senior lender to miners underwrite at 80% all-in LTV against the physical assets? Same question wrt to rate\u2026is 6% market for senior secured leverage?   We don\u2019t know of any direct comparables to the structure we are proposing. Terms are typically 5 years and they are bullets (all the principal is repaid at the end). We think our proposal is better: around a 2-year average life since we\u2019re paying down the loan in line with the projected amortization. At the risk of belaboring this point, note again that machine pricing is about as accommodative as it has ever been right now so we\u2019re buying the machines at a good time in the cycle.     teej:  3. Senior Secured or? As contemplated, Maker\u2019s security interest is in the shares of Cabot as opposed to the M30s themselves, as @christiancdpetersen highlighted in his review. In this case, other indebtedness could be incurred on the machines, other PPE, or unencumbered power generation, or hosting revenue, correct? As your group will hopefully know well, Maker is positioned as a senior secured lender. Does this opportunity in fact fit that bill?   MakerDAO will have a senior unencumbered claim over Cabot and its assets; Cabot is a limited purpose entity and is prohibited from indebtedness of any activities not in support of protecting and isolating the collateral. The senior claim is limited to the miners inventoried through the on-chain recording process and the Unwind Expenses Wallet. Normally in project, property or equipment (the \u201cPPE\u201d) financing, the PPE is funded for its acquisition cost, and a combination of the PPE and proceeds thereon are used as credit support. PPE is almost never periodically marked down with corresponding early repayment obligations as in a financial futures contract. Cabot resets the PPE lower on each scheduled date, and redeems such projected decline in value. This markdown has the effects of shortening the lending exposure and increasing the relative seniority of the loan over time as illustrated in the materials.     teej:  4. Mining Economics: In a previous post (pasted above), we discussed how Cabot\u2019s operation breaks even at $16K BTC pre-halving and $25.5K post halving. Compared to large miners like Riot, Marathon, and Core Scientific, this represents quite an an efficient operation. This efficiency will be driven by a few factors of course\u2014let\u2019s focus on two: (A) energy cost and (B) The M30s A. What is the meter rate for the geothermal source in Paraguay? (Apologies if this was answered, typing this on my phone)   No worries, appreciate your hustle on-the-go. Approximately 4.5 cents, are the prices we have arranged for, with the ability for costs to move lower with scale. And of course, the power is 100% renewable.     teej:  B. The 3,000 M30s have not yet been ordered\u2014this is what the proceeds of a prospective loan from Maker would be used for. Is this break-even BTC quoted contingent upon the delivery, installment, and incorporation of the new machines? Or does this break-even describe the Paraguay facility as is? What model rigs are currently installed and cash-flowing at Exos\u2019 operation in Paraguay? If the break-even does incorporate the new machines, have the machines already been ordered? What is the lead time on delivery?   We have not yet ordered the new machines, though the break-even provided would reflect the integration of the newly purchased machines. On average, 4-6 weeks, for delivery of the machines has been communicated to us from our wholesaler. For model rigs we intend to install at the Paraguayan operation please see the below question 5.     teej:  5. Size: What is the total size of Exos/Cabot\u2019s mining operations at this moment? How many machines total? Hashrate? (May have been answered) How much BTC mined on a T-12 basis?   As of today, we have 2,236 A9s and 1,239 SPX36s for a total 3,475 machines. Since inception in 2019 the average Hashing Rate of the A9 and SPX36 are ~92.4% and ~74.1%, respectively. Bear in mind, we paused our operations in late 2021 in order to relocate to Paraguay; as noted in question 1 here, 1,500 machines have arrived in Paraguay, and are in transit to the designated facility. Our expectation for the remaining pre-existing mining machine shipments to arrive is approximately 30 days. While we have not directly mined BTC over our 3.5 year operating history, the value mined has typically run about $1mm/month during our active mining operations.  ",

                    "content": "Greenlight Recommendation RWF is comfortable issuing the following for the benefit of MKR token holders who may participate in the upcoming green-light poll: Summary: Though hash power-backed lending is of long-term strategic value to Maker (and I commend Cabot for recognizing and capitalizing on the intersection of Green x Hash-Power Backed Lending), the sector is significantly riskier than any of our existing lending activity, whether crypto-loans or RWAs. As such, Maker\u2019s foray into hash-power backed lending should benefit from fundamentals stronger than those inherent to this proposal. Maker has recently been approached by a number of players that are proposing significantly more suitable structures and terms for a similar product. Some of these alternative structures may enable Maker to build out a more scaleable engine for Hash-Power Backed Loan Obligations (HBLOs), a more composable and trust-minimized form of RWAs. We should be wary of jumping on the first HBL opportunity that arrives on our door-step, not because Cabot has done anything wrong but because there will be many more where it came from. Let\u2019s remember that the power dynamics have shifted: Maker has earned the right to be picky. As I will continue to say ad nauseum, for RWAs to be profitable and provide value to token holders (today), MakerDAO should be focusing on wholesale-esc relationships that scale. I.e. build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, underwrite the underwriter, and drip additional funding to them as the vault seasons and the underwriter performs. MakerDAO ought not to be a jack of all trades and master of none. It wants to empower specialist lenders to execute in their niches, not to build out a bloated and ineffective credit underwriting department. I believe that this proposal presents poor risk-adjusted return to the protocol, in both an absolute and relative sense. I recommend MKR token holders not greenlight this collateral. Risks   Ad-Hoc vs. Wholesale: For Maker to expand into hash-power backed lending, an esoteric space, it should do so via a wholesale, repeatable model. Instead of lending against a small, potentially one-off project (Cabot - Paraguay), we\u2019d like to underwrite an underwriter who is financially aligned and knows BTC hash-power backed lending well. A la the HVB deal, this allows Maker to take advantage of a more turn-key, aligned yield solution.   Size is a Feature: In all business sectors, especially during turbulence, the strong get stronger. BTC miners are in tatters right now, offering firesale asset opportunities for the well-capitalized\u2014Maker should ally only with the strongest.    Low BTC price tends to cause consolidation as the strong ingest (at a huge discount) and integrate the assets of the weak. Relative to other miners in space, Cabot is a relatively modest operation. Maker should, at least as a pilot, be backing miners who will (in the long-run) benefit from, rather than suffer in downturns. This means backing large existing BTC mining operators and operators flush with cash. Given Cabot\u2019s break-even BTC price of $16K and meter rate of 4.5 cents, Cabot is in a relatively strong position. The fundamental economics, to some extent, offset the smaller footprint.    Leverage Profile: Bitcoin mining risks are a derivative of BTC spot risks. As such, lending against machines with a certain productive potential (hashrate) to create BTC can generate a loss if the leverage is too high. The going-in 80% Maker attachment point (All-in LTV closer to 75% with Unwind Cash Trap) on the underlying asset is higher than the market standard and about equivalent to the leverage profile of a mortgage, a patently safer asset. The risk of principal loss is thus high as structured.   Though the loan is fully-amortizing, the year one principal risk is moderate.    Focus/Expertise: Exos does a lot of different things, including securities trading, commercial finance, asset management, alternative investment, technology ventures, digital investments, AI, and NLP. Though Exos manages a Morgan Creek BTC fund, this strikes me as a sophisticated, but generalist crypto financial services shop. For our pilot in BTC hash power backed lending, Maker should focus on long-standing specialists in the space.   Though Exos has been mining since 2019, the firm\u2019s focus has been on Zen and Zcash. Surely know-how is transferable, but not perfectly.    Jurisdictional Risk: It is unclear how strong Maker\u2019s rights and remedies as a senior lender would be in Paraguay. Again, Maker\u2019s foray into hash-power backed lending should entail relatively secure fundamentals to make up for the inherent risk of the asset class.   Term: Most hash-power backed loans have 2-3 year terms. Taking on a five-year term, especially fixed at 6% interest rate exposes Maker to repayment, duration, and interest rate risk. The fully-amortizing nature of the loan offsets the longer term to some extent.   Opportunities   BTC Mining: Crypto economies, digital states, are secured in no small part due to Bitcoin. As the Decentral bank of crypto, Maker\u2019s financing of mining is akin to national security spending. Cabot\u2019s MIP-6 provides Maker an opportunity to pilot a lending business within a sector that we could uniquely generate an edge in (unlike a lot of structured credit).   Profit + Sustainability: Not only are Cabot\u2019s miners powered via green energy (in this case geothermal), but Maker\u2019s financing of green energy in this case does not sacrifice profit. Paraguay\u2019s geothermal supply is commercially competitive if not cheaper than fossil fuel sources. This can be evidence in Cabot\u2019s 4.5 cent meter rate.   Management Reputation: Exos, Cabot\u2019s parent company, is headed by the former CEO of Credit Suisse, Brady Dougan.   Jurisdictional Diversification: As of yet, Maker has no RWA footprint in South America. Given the conciliatory stance taken by many South and Central American administrations, this jurisdictional diversification could strengthen Maker\u2019s regulatory position.   Fully Amortizing: as opposed to a bullet term, the Cabot financing structure contemplates progressive/straight-line repayment of principal over the course of the loan.   ",

                    "content": "Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC MakerDAO Real-World Assets Collateral Application 1.\tWho is the interested party for this collateral application? Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC (\u201cCabot\u201d) is wholly owned by Exos Capital LLC (\u201cExos\u201d). Cabot will acquire and control approximately 3,000 Bitcoin mining machines to be co-located with Exos\u2019 existing Bitcoin miners in Paraguay. Cabot will acquire at least $15 million in mining machines. Cabot will be formed and organized as a Delaware limited purpose LLC prior to a final approval of the proposal. Cabot will operate as a limited purpose entity, organized solely for the purposes of collateral management, including securing undeployed DAI, mining machines, and DAI pending return to MakerDAO. Exos Capital LLC is an affiliate of Exos TFP Holdings LLC (including its affiliates, \u201cExos\u201d).  Exos was founded in 2017, and detailed information about Exos is available at https://www.exosfinancial.com/. Exos will serve as the \u201cOperator\u201d of Cabot\u2019s Bitcoin mining assets (the \u201cCollateral\u201d). Exos anticipates performing the operational, settlement and day-to-day work with its in-house staff, drawing from its trading, operations, accounting/reporting, legal, and compliance personnel. The primary contact for Cabot is Edgar Ortiz ([email\u00a0protected]) and the primary contacts for Exos are Jason Hauf ([email\u00a0protected]) and Andrew Des Rault ([email\u00a0protected]). 2.\tProvide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Cabot\u2019s acquisition of approximately 3,000 machines will expand Exos\u2019 Bitcoin mining operations in South America. Exos has made investments in purpose-built facilities with direct access to renewable hydroelectric power in Paraguay. Exos has been relocating existing miners from North America to Paraguay, and the Cabot proposal is an expansion of the mining capacity at such facilities. An equivalent dollar value of $15 million of Cabot-owned machines will serve as the collateral for the proposed DAI amount of $12 million (i.e., an initial 80% collateral value), which will be returned over four years (the \u201cProject Term\u201d). For the purposes of the project, Cabot assumes that the collateral value of the machines will decline linearly by 20% per year, over each year of the Project Term, leaving an assumed 20% residual value for the miners at the end of the fourth year of the Project Term. At Cabot\u2019s direction, Exos will remit DAI amounts to MakerDAO annually, reflecting: (a) the annual projected decline in collateral value, plus (b) the collateral yield, plus (c) a final amount reflecting the decline in collateral value for such final year, which shall result in an aggregate Project Term principal amount equal to $12 million USD, inclusive of all previous returns of collateral. Our proposal and assumptions regarding the collateral value included in this application are based on our good faith and commercially reasonable estimates of the value of the mining machines and the information we have available to us regarding the rate of depreciation of such machines as of the date of this application. The following four-year schedule depicts the projected miners\u2019 value, corresponding DAI collateral value, the DAI collateral value as a percentage of the miner acquisition costs, and the return of collateral.  The miner collateral will be approximately 3,000 MicroBT M30+ machines (~95 Ths, 3,327 W) or equivalent Bitcoin mining machines with an acquisition value of at least $15 million U.S. dollars. We believe that the addition of the Cabot project is an attractive diversification to MakerDAO\u2019s collateral holdings, and the project directly supports the use of renewable hydro-electric power for cryptographic mining. For Exos, the Cabot proposal is an attractive avenue to scale its mining operations with an expert counterparty. Further, Cabot is a unique crossover collateral transaction which brings a dedicated hardware-secured mining operation into decentralized DAO collateral. Cabot will make annual remittances to MakerDAO in DAI. Annual remittance will be equal to the sum of: (x) the collateral return amount, plus (y) a collateral return amount equal to 6.0% of the outstanding DAI amount immediately preceding the remittance. 3.\tHow long has the project been live in production. The Paraguay site is the new location for Exos\u2019 mining operations, and the site is expected to be operational within 90 days of writing this application. The facilities, local labor, and energy sources for mining operations have been secured and contracted. Construction of the facility is currently in its final stages. Critically, for knowledge of MakerDAO and members of the forum, the financing referenced in Question #2 and to which this application corresponds, will support the expansion of Exos\u2019 existing mining operations that have been successful and on-going since 2019. Currently, our initial shipment of 1,500 mining machines, which are not connected to this financing, will arrive in Paraguay by ocean liner in approximately 90 days. As it relates to the purchase of 3,000 MicroBT M30+ mining machines, we believe it will take us 90 days to purchase, transport, and \u201cplug-in\u201d the machines from the time our application for Collateral Onboarding is approved by the MakerDAO community. Exos and its affiliates have been developing plans to shift the totality of their mining business to South America since late 2021. Since then, the Operator has worked with local contractors, developers, and other third-parties to secure the agreements necessary to begin operations. 4.\tProvide a brief history of the project. Exos began its North America cryptocurrency mining operation in 2019, primarily focused on mining Bitcoin, Z-Cash, Zen, and Dash. The multi-year operation has provided the team with critical knowledge and knowhow in operating a successful mining operation. Our experience covers the gambit of potential challenges associated with owning a crypto currency mining operation. This would include the traditional infrastructure work such as identifying the appropriate hosting site, negotiating contracts and vendor agreements with third-parties, and deciding which cryptocurrencies offer the most attractive mining returns. Importantly, and critical to the success of the MakerDAO arrangement, we have significant experience sourcing, evaluating, and acquiring mining machines. This expands further, past the point of purchase, in that we have the technical capabilities to ensure ongoing monitoring of machine performance that is further supported by procedures for identifying and troubleshooting problems that may arise. Aside from the technical expertise necessary to operate a crypto mining facility, we also have the necessary operations and trading personnel to facilitate currency conversions associated with this undertaking, including DAI-for-USD, USD-for-DAI, or any other conversions required to facilitate this arrangement. These functions are further supported by employees in compliance, legal, and accounting services that ensure seamless functioning for back and middle office operations. In late 2021, Exos identified Paraguay as a desirable venue for the expansion of its existing mining operations. Notably, the country is powered by 100% renewable hydro-electric power and has low import tariffs on mining machinery. Beginning in 2022, after finalizing the energy agreement with partners in Paraguay, Exos quickly moved to contract developers for the facility. Construction for the facility is in its final stages. As mentioned in Question #3, we expect construction to be complete within 90 days from the time of writing this application. Independent of the result from this application, Exos expects this portion of its mining operation to become operational soon thereafter. 5.\tLink the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Cabot will hold the collateral including an address for DAI (for both initial DAI and DAI repayments), the mining machines, and an address for NFTs which will serve as on-chain recording of each DAI-for-machine deployment and each DAI collateral return. Cabot will record the deployment of DAI-for-miners on-chain through the minting of NFTs (see \u201cA\u201d in diagram below) where an NFT will record a listing of the individual machines and the corresponding DAI repayment schedule (see \u201cC\u201d in diagram below).  Since repayment will occur over four years, each DAI-for-miner deployment will be recorded as 4 NFTs (e.g., NFT N_1, N_2, N_3, and N_4) where \u201cN\u201d is the deployment identifier, and 1 through 4 indicate the annual DAI repayment obligation.  Accordingly, the first deployment of DAI-for-miners is recorded as \u201cNFT 1_1\u201d, \u201cNFT 1_2\u201d, \u201cNFT 1_3\u201d and \u201cNFT 1_4\u201d and the nth deployment will be recorded as \u201cNFT N_[1-4]\u201d).  There are expected to be a number of deployments as the miners are expected to be purchased in a number of separate transactions. Following each annual collateral return, the corresponding NFTs will be burned (see \u201cB\u201d in diagram below).  image774\u00d7514 12.4 KB  DAI collateral payments from Exos to Cabot will be remitted to MakerDAO. 6.\tWhat type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token, etc.) Capital Asset: at launch, at least $15 million of Bitcoin mining machines with predetermined collateral value adjustments and scheduled collateral returns. Approximately 3,000 MicroBT M30+ machines (~95 Ths, 3,327 W) or equivalent Bitcoin mining machines. 7.\tHow is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights). As a Capital Asset, the mining machines will not have any rights or distribution entitlements which may be present in a token. Cabot will operate as a limited purpose entity, organized solely for the purposes of collateral management, including securing undeployed DAI, mining machines, and DAI pending return to MakerDAO. Cabot will not hold or own any mined currencies from the mining operations. 8.\tWhat is the market cap for the asset? The asset does not have a token market cap metric, but the value of the assets are at least $15 million USD at inception. 9.\tWhere does the exchange for the asset occur? 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth. N/A 10.\tIs the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)? The asset will settle off chain with two important features to simplify and track collateral return on-chain. First, the preset collateral value adjustments will result in a return of collateral to MakerDAO at prescribed times and in prescribed amounts without reliance on exogenous sources or data feeds. Second, Exos will reflect both the collateral deployments and collateral returns on-chain through the minting and burning of NFTs. The NFTs can be held in an address controlled by Cabot, MakerDAO, or a designated agent. 11.\tIf offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, processes, and estimated time. Collateral will be held by the limited purpose company Cabot. Cabot will be organized by Exos for the purposes of segregating, maintaining, and monitoring MakerDAO\u2019s collateral interests. While Exos will run the limited operations of Cabot, Exos\u2019 activities will be limited to the maintenance of a DAI wallet, the acquisition of the miners, and the return of the DAI collateral to MakerDAO. Because the collateral valuations will be preset and pre-scheduled, no delays are expected (see also Question #32 below). 12.\tList any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type. N/A 13.\tList any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type. The scheduled depreciation of the miner collateral (as shown above in response to Question #2) is expected to eliminate the need to liquidate collateral, and Cabot, through Exos, is expected to keep the miner collateral in constant use (see also Question #32 below). We are unaware of any parties that are currently interested in taking part of an associated liquidation of the collateral. Additionally, we do not intend to consult a third party to serve in this function. 14.\tWhat is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault? The DAI will be converted into US dollars for acquisition of the mining machines. As detailed in Question #2 above, DAI will be returned on each anniversary consistent with changes in the predetermined collateral value of the mining machines. 15.\tWhat is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated? $12 million USD equivalent as soon as practical following approval and acceptance of this proposal. $12 million USD should be regarded as the minimum amount. 16.\tWhat are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral? The Cabot project introduces MakerDAO\u2019s MIP6 to the direct support of the hardware and infrastructure which runs cryptocurrencies and digital assets with fully renewable energy. 17.\tWhat are the legal risks associated with the tokens? The Bitcoin miner collateral is not expected to introduce any new or novel legal risks. Further, since the bilateral NFTs are minted and burned solely to serve as a utility for on-chain record-keeping and because the tokens will not be transferred or distributed, they are also not expected to introduce any new or novel legal risks. The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission has taken the position, in some cases, that tokens are \u201csecurities\u201d under the U.S. Securities Laws and it may be the case that the applicable regulators in other jurisdictions take an equivalent position.  While we do not expect the \u201cpledge\u201d of the tokens to violate the securities laws (to the extent the securities laws are deemed applicable to the tokens), it is possible the applicable securities regulators could assert or invoke jurisdiction over the tokens in certain respects. 18.\tDoes one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Cabot will be organized in the state of Delaware with operations in Paraguay and bears all legal responsibility for the performance of Cabot\u2019s obligations with respect to MakerDAO. Cabot\u2019s day to day operations will be run by Exos with full transparency to MakerDAO. Exos is organized in Delaware with operations in New York. 19.\tHas the project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Because the Cabot proposal is limited to the mining of Bitcoin with renewable hydroelectric power, and the NFTs are solely used for the utility of on-chain record keeping, no legal opinions or memoranda are contemplated. 20.\tDescribe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 21.\tIs the issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)? 21.a If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity and jurisdiction? Centralized and trusted. Exos will provide the operational support for Cabot. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the disruption events listed in Question #32 below, in the event that Cabot fails to satisfy either a collateral return or collateral yield payment within 60 calendar days, after being provided written notice from MakerDAO, MakerDAO or its agent may initiate Collateral liquidation process. For the purpose of delivering notice, or any other communication to MakerDAO, Cabot and/or Exos may communicate via the MakerDAO forum and any such communication or posting on the forum shall be deemed valid notice by Cabot and/or Exos for all purposes. 22.\tLink any audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Within 90 calendar days of the receipt of the machines relating to a DAI deployment, Cabot will cause a recording and minting of the inventory of on-site machines (see Question #2 diagram, Item C) in the corresponding NFTs. In addition, Exos and Cabot will provide real-time, total transparency to Cabot\u2019s operations including:  24/7 webcams on the actual machines real-time dashboard indicating which machines are on site  Outstanding amounts will be evidenced by minted and unburned NFTs. NFTs will be minted for each DAI-for-miner deployment, and NFTs will be burned when DAI is returned to MakerDAO. 23.\tHas the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified? While the NFTs are not critical to success of the project or the return of collateral, the NFTs minted and burned to track to DAI deployments and DAI returns will conform with the ERC-721 standard. 24.\tDoes the asset follow a token standard? (e.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400) The assets underlying the DAI creation are the Bitcoin mining machines. ERC721 tokens will be used solely for the purpose of on-chain recording. 25.\tIs the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)? The Cabot assets will be operated and managed by Exos at Cabot\u2019s direction. MakerDAO will not retain beneficial ownership in Exos\u2019 mining operations, and accordingly, have no claim on the proceeds generated from mining activities. 26.\tDoes the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved? N/A 27.\tCan the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved? We do not plan to provide for a change or upgrade to the reporting token, however, if an alternative token format were preferred by MakerDAO, it\u2019s likely that Cabot would accommodate a change. 28.\tDoes the token contain debasing logic? N/A 29.\tProvide (a) proposed legal structure for the transaction Cabot will be the direct counterparty to MakerDAO, and Cabot will be formed and organized immediately prior to execution of the proposed transaction. Cabot will be formed as a Delaware limited liability company (LLC), and Cabot\u2019s limited purpose will be restricted to the receipt of DAI, the holding of the mining machines, and the return of DAI to MakerDAO. Following the creation of the DAI and remittance to Cabot, DAI will be exchanged for US dollars for the purchase of Cabot\u2019s Bitcoin mining machines. On each annual anniversary of the Project Term, Cabot will instruct Exos to obtain DAI via an exchange, who will in turn provide DAI to Cabot, and Cabot will transfer DAI to MakerDAO. 30.\tProvide details on the organizational structure of the interested party, beneficial ownership, governance/control, key personnel, capital/funding resources and past financial performance. Attached to this application we have included a detailed organizational chart of the interested party, in addition to descriptions of the various business lines operated by the interested party\u2019s Parent company. For more detailed information on beneficial ownership, governance/control, and key personnel we would encourage members of the forum to visit our publicly available Form ADV that is filed on behalf of the Exos affiliated and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered investment advisor, Exos Asset Management.  image882\u00d7548 83.4 KB  31.\tProvide detailed summary of the proposed economic terms of the transaction including without limitation, commitment term, principal amount, interest rate, frequency of principal and interest payments, disbursement schedule, equity amount, funding ratios (equity/debt pro rata, equity first, etc.) collateral security, coverage ratios, currency (if not DAI) and other material terms. The quality of the proposed economic terms will be a consideration for the prioritization process.  32.\tIdentify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address without limitation and to the extent relevant: market risks, commercial risks (e.g. diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc. The primary risk of the proposal is that collateral is not returned and the risk mitigation measures are insufficient to result in a full return of the collateral and payment of the expected yield. Because the collateral is machines and not an alternative token/coin protocol or asset-based cash flows which require service/performance in a competitive marketplace, most risks relating to regulation, commercial and competition are limited. Competition: Cabot\u2019s obligations to MakerDAO are not reliant on the success of either Cabot or Exos generating any particular level of market share, business activity, or asset-based returns. It is possible that overall lower levels of activity in Bitcoin mining and price levels (including in respect of other cryptocurrencies) could adversely impact the value of the mining machines and the associated mining revenue the project generates. General Industry Risks: An early and rapid decline in the value of mining machines and simultaneous failure of Cabot to return collateral could leave MakerDAO less well collateralized. To mitigate these risks, Exos has made its equity fully subordinated to the MakerDAO collateral return, and the preset annual returns of collateral progressively de-risk MakerDAO\u2019s exposure. Legal and Regulatory Risks: Bitcoin has enjoyed a unique regulatory position relative to other coins and tokens; we do not expect to its regulatory character to change.  However, there is always the risk that regulators may assert broader jurisdiction over Bitcoin and, in particular, transactions effected on MakerDAO, including the issuance of DAI.  We also do not expect there to by any regulatory changes that would materially impact the operation of the machines.  That said, it is possible that regulatory changes could materially impact the profitability of the machines or ability to operate the machines, in which case they could be moved to one or more alternative countries with a more favorable regulatory regime in the event of unexpected legal or regulatory developments within the original host country. Interest Rate Risk: Unlike a conventional borrowing arrangement, annual preset returns of DAI collateral reduce the interest rate risk. For example, on the second anniversary, only one-half of the DAI collateral remains outstanding and subject to rises in interest rates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, borrowing at a fixed rate opposed to a variable rate can expose the lender to additional interest rate risk. Commercial and Market Risks: It is possible that market conditions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could negatively impact the profitability of this project. Further, if the market for mining machines drops dramatically early in the Project Term, the support provided by the subordinated equity is diminished. Execution & Operating Related Risks: Our results of operations, including the levels of the project\u2019s net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our annual financial results include: (i)\tthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure; (ii)\tfluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and (iii)\tgeneral economic, industry and market conditions. Illiquidity Risks: The Collateral or the tokens evidencing rights to the Collateral may be or become illiquid which may affect MakerDAO\u2019s ability to exit such asset. Cyber-Related Risks: Cabot and its Operator, Exos Capital, and their third-party service providers are subject to risks associated with \u201ccybersecurity\u201d breaches. \u201cCybersecurity\u201d is a generic term used to describe the technology, processes and practices designed to protect networks, systems, computers, programs and data from unauthorized access or manipulation by other computer users and the efforts to avoid the resulting damage and disruption of hardware and software systems, loss or corruption of data and/or misappropriation of confidential information. Cybersecurity breaches may be the result of intentional actions (such as an attempt by a third party to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to Cabot, Exos data) or unintentional events. Any such breach could expose the arrangement to financial loss (including those associated with the forensic analysis of the origin and scope of the breach and costs of increased and upgraded information technology systems and/or cybersecurity countermeasures), the disruption of business, unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation, the dissemination of confidential and proprietary information or reputational damage. Disruptions in the market for DAI and the Ethereum blockchain: can alter the timing of collateral returns. In the event that transactions to either acquire or transmit DAI are subject to disruption (a \u201cMarket Disruption\u201d), Exos will notify MakerDAO of such disruption via the MakerDAO forum or alternative means. A Market Disruption means any of: (i)\ttransactions submitted to the Ethereum blockchain are materially delayed or failing, (ii)\tthe MakerDAO protocol is reported to be down or inoperative, (iii) gas prices for a transaction on the Ethereum network exceed the equivalent of $200, as reported by Etherscan.io or a similar data source, (iv) Exos is unable to acquire DAI for 1.00 US dollar (taking into consideration all historically consistent transaction costs). Cabot reserves the right to delay the return of collateral and other payment obligations during a Market Disruption until such time such Market Disruption is remedied or no longer occurring. 33.\tOutline the applicant\u2019s underwriting guidelines/policies, origination strategy (marketing, sales, channels), servicing strategy (charge-offs, collections), and historical asset performance. N/A 34.\tOutline the applicant\u2019s risk monitoring and operations guidelines/policies (e.g. chargeoffs, collection, recovery provisions, data collection and technology, etc.) Mining machines sites will be located at secure sites with 24/7 monitoring by both on site personnel and video camera live feeds. We will also provide a web accessible dashboard that will display the status of the machines (online vs. offline), utilization rates, and other operating metrics. Upon completion of the facility and receipt of the machines, Cabot will cause a local audit or law firm to perform an audit confirming that the inventory of on-site machines (see Question #2 diagram, Item C). Consistent with our historical mining experience, we will enter into a new insurance contract with a local insurance provider in order to secure coverage for the mining machines. We expect insurance to cover damages such as theft, destruction, or impairment from any number of sources. We expect the insurance policy to be secured at the time the facility\u2019s construction is complete. Policy details will be available to Maker DAO, in a confidential manner, once finalized. 35.\tDescribe the regulatory regime applicable to the underlying asset (if any) and the applicant\u2019s legal and compliance programs relating thereto. Because the Cabot proposal is limited to the mining of Bitcoin with renewable hydroelectric power, and the DAI exchanges between MakerDAO and Cabot are direct and bilateral, no new regulatory or compliance matters are anticipated. With respect to all conversions of DAI-for-USD and USD-for-DAI, Exos is expected to utilize larger and more established centralized or decentralized exchanges. 36.\tIdentify any 3rd party persons likely to be relied upon by the applicant to implement the transaction (legal, accounting, servicers, trustees, etc,). Exos anticipates performing the operational, settlement and day-to-day work with its in-house staff, drawing from its trading, operations, accounting/reporting, legal, and compliance personnel. Exos will engage an outside auditor or law firm to validate and confirm the mining machine details within each minted NFT. Exos will contract for 24/7 video surveillance of the mining site which will be made available on a Cabot managed website.

Hello and Thank You for submitting this MIP6 application. With regards to the value of the M30+ machines, I see them offered to retail at $1500 (on average)\u2013can you please provide more color on how you\u2019re valuing it at $15M USD?     CabotRenewableTeam:  Exos has made investments in purpose-built facilities with direct access to renewable hydroelectric power in Paraguay. Exos has been relocating existing miners from North America to Paraguay, and the Cabot proposal is an expansion of the mining capacity at such facilities.   Can you please provide a breakdown/comparable of income, expenses, and profit for mining in NA versus Paraguay?     CabotRenewableTeam:  For the purposes of the project, Cabot assumes that the collateral value of the machines will decline linearly by 20% per year, over each year of the Project Term, leaving an assumed 20% residual value for the miners at the end of the fourth year of the Project Term.   Are you able to provide visual evidence as to why the depreciation will be 20%, as oppose to a higher (maybe lower) percentage?     CabotRenewableTeam:  That said, it is possible that regulatory changes could materially impact the profitability of the machines or ability to operate the machines, in which case they could be moved to one or more alternative countries with a more favorable regulatory regime in the event of unexpected legal or regulatory developments within the original host country.   Can you please provide more color on how you plan to insure a DAI loan in-case the above  scenario plays-out? Will keep reading through your app, and let you know if I have any other questions.

Consequently, Paraguay is highly dependent on the hydrological conditions of the rivers that feed the main hydropower plants of the country. Paraguay is considered a net power exporter. In 2019, it sold 64% of the total power produced to Brazil and Argentina, equivalent to 31,748 GWh. Electricity sales to neighboring countries represented 6.0% of the GDP that year (VMME, 2020b).

And we would somehow have to take possession of and sell a bunch of Bitcoin mining rigs in Paraguay. This would turn the project into a huge money loser even if we can do all that.   Indeed. Ultimately, when underwriting these things the equation is pretty simple. Inputs: Energy, PPE, labor/overhead. Outputs: spot BTC. You\u2019d want to chart BTC within a historical price action range and understand with a few standard deviations the range of possibilities for your take-out. You\u2019ll then be able to back into into the break-even for the sponsor company you\u2019re considering levering up. If the break-even is notably below the 2 sigma lower bound, you\u2019re safer. Of course if BTC crashes, ASICs (a btc derivative) will suffer. But this is why understanding your borrowing counter-party is critical. Large, institutional miners may actually benefit from a low BTC price because it kills smaller miners with less favorable economies of scale. These smaller operations have a break-even that gets tripped more easily than scaled operations. So when BTC drops, scaled operations enhance their market position by opportunistically engulfing the land, energy, and machines of their smaller counter-parts. This is a function of all markets in disarray\u2014the strong get stronger. So as I think about moving into this asset class. The logic is not: because the value of our collateral (ASICs, land, PPE, PPAs) will fall with BTC, an asset Maker is already exposed to, we should avoid it. But rather, is this an asset that Maker can have an EDGE in understanding and lending against. Most of our RWAs thus far have been imported from competitive TradFi markets. We should be thinking: what sorts of assets are UNIQUELY fitted to Maker lending rails?     CodeKnight:  The loan isn\u2019t scalable or liquid. It will be a challenge to find a buyer if we need to sell.   In general we do want to avoid non-scaleable implementations. Interestingly, there are MANY players floating around who want to participate in these markets, on both the demand and supply sides. I\u2019ve spoken to a few of them recently. There\u2019s got to be a way to combine these disparate parties and plop them into a single scaleable structure. Exploring this now. To your second point, the markets are thin but not THAT thin. As mentioned previously, the biggest players are always looking for opportunistic ways to expand capacity. ",

                    "content": "    ChrisBlec:  How would liquidation of this collateral happen, if needed? How would MakerDAO obtain the collateral for liquidation? What assurances are there that the collateral would be available for MakerDAO to obtain? Who at MakerDAO would be responsible for this process? How would the collateral be sold off and to whom?   ChrisBlec, thank you for your comments, and we appreciate your patience while we have taken the time to provide an appropriate response. Relating to MakerDAO\u2019s access to collateral, Cabot is in the process of arranging Navier (https://navier.com/), a mining operator, to provide operational oversight, security, and surveillance of the facility. While Navier is expected to provide these services for the foreseeable future, Exos reserves the right to affect a replacement of an equivalent provider. In the event of a failure to return collateral under the Project terms, Navier will facilitate access to and liquidation of the Cabot miners. To ensure that MakerDAO has access to the collateral, Exos Capital will pledge its equity interests in Cabot to MakerDAO, which at the direction of MakerDAO, may necessitate the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code naming MakerDAO or its designee as \u201csecured party\u201d; Cabot will also pledge its ownership of the mining machines in a similar manner. To cover expenses associated with a liquidation of Cabot and the miners, Cabot will cause Exos Capital to deposit the first $250,000 of mining revenues generated by the Cabot miners in a wallet held at Cabot (the \u201cUnwind Expenses Wallet\u201d). The Unwind Expenses Wallet will hold cryptocurrency generated by the miners, and will true-up on a quarterly basis to maintain approximately $250,000 USD equivalent in available funds. By \u201ctrue up\u201d we mean that if there is an amount below $250,000 USD in the Unwind Expenses Wallet at the end of the relevant quarter, Exos Capital will be required to deposit the amount of such deficiency in the Unwind Expenses Wallet. Likewise, if there happens to be an amount of funds in the Unwind Expenses Wallet in excess of $250,000 USD at the end of any quarter, the amount of such surplus will be returned to Exos Capital. The funds held in the Unwind Expenses Wallet are available to pay for the costs of liquidation of the collateral as detailed below. At the point that collateral is fully returned, MakerDAO\u2019s claims to Cabot, including its claim to the miners and any amounts held at Cabot, including the Unwind Expenses Wallet, are extinguished. As part of the Project Terms, Cabot will arrange for its service provider, Navier (or any successor), to act on behalf of MakerDAO in the event of collateral liquidation in the manner detailed below. Alternatively, MakerDAO can designate an alternative agent to act as its service provider to facilitate the liquidation of collateral. Upon failure by Cabot to return collateral under the Project Terms, MakerDAO may direct Navier (or its alternative designated agent) to proceed with either (a) an auction of the miners, or (b) shipment of the miners to [a][such] designated agent. Absent instruction from MakerDAO, Exos would recommend that Navier conduct an auction and remit the proceeds to MakerDAO through its ownership of Cabot (i.e., by virtue of the equity pledge by Exos Capital, MakerDAO could take control of Cabot under the terms of this arrangement). In any such scenario, the funds in the Unwind Expense Wallet may be used to pay the costs of the liquidation of the miners, including administration, management, inventory, auctioning, shipping, freight and other related expenses. At the time of liquidation, MakerDAO may use Navier (or an alternative agent) to facilitate the liquidation of collateral as described above. Exos Capital estimates administration related expenses to be less than $100,000 and shipping related expenses to be less than $150,000. At the election of MakerDAO, and instead of a liquidation, it is expected that MakerDAO could continue the operation of the machines at the Paraguay facility in the event of a failed collateral return by taking control of Cabot pursuant to the pledge of Cabot\u2019s equity interests by Exos Capital.

Prior to the next halving, we forecast a breakeven price of BTC of approximately 16,000. After the next halving, assuming BTC price remains at current levels until then, the breakeven price is approximately 25,500. At current levels, and especially pre-halving, this project will generate a lot of revenue that creates a sort of reserve to protect against future drops. Furthermore, if BTC prices trade below our break-even at any point, we can strategically turn off the machines for a short period of time in order to preserve our profits. Finally, there exists an important relationship between the hashrate and the BTC price that is supportive of newer machines deployed in areas with low cost of power. If BTC were to drop precipitously, we would expect that many of the more inefficient miners (either in terms of specs or cost of power) to leave the network, thereby increasing our share of the network.
