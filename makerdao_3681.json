A ledger spreadsheet exists and will be shared in the near future, we\u2019re currently trying to figure out how much information should be shared publicly and how much should be obfuscated to maintain contributors and grantee\u2019s privacy. Multi-sig Address: 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73 Keyholders:   @LongForWisdom : 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69  @prose11 : 0xf3ED2bdeBa77940E6759B806cd55CE20cAE369BE  Per MIP47c1:   Governance must be able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time.   You can check the spending limit section here. The DSPauseProxy Contract is allowed up to 1B DAI.   Signatory requirements providing no less than \u2154 of listed signatories to sign off on an action.   It\u2019s a 2 of 2 mult-sig currently, with @LongForWisdom and @prose11 as keyholders.  All signers must be tagged on the forum and their willingness to be included in the Multi-Sig publicly confirmed.  Confirmed.  A representative for the Multi-Sig must be designated as an official point of contact.  @LongForWisdom is the primary contact.  There must be a clear and public explanation of the purpose and scope of the Multi-Sig.  Administering funds designated by Maker Governance to be spent to achieve the GovAlpha Core Unit mandate.  A clearly defined process for onboarding and offboarding signatories.  Facilitators of GovAlpha will be added as keyholders to this multi-sig. Signatory requirements will be adjusted as necessary to maintain 2/3rd signers wherever possible. In certain circumstances members of GovAlpha may be added as keyholders at the existing facilitators discretion to maintain an adequate level of security for administered funds.   A wallet address to be whitelisted.   0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73  Following an approved Governance action that involves a newly recognized Multi-Sig, the information provided will be added to a list of recognized Multi-Sig Wallets.  @MIP-Editors please add this to the list when appropriate.
