I believe that it would be very beneficial for the project and for the owners of the UNI tokens, that a group of experts be created to manage these funds and move them among the LP groups that generate the greatest profit at all times. Imagine that we deposit our tokens in a dynamic LP that automatically moves between those LPs that generate the greatest profit at all times. A kind of investment fund, with temporary possibilities, risk, etc., under the supervision of the group of experts mentioned above and with the guarantee and support of the UNI governance group What do you think?
