                    "content": "Hey all, D3M launched this week and has seen the debt ceiling fully utilised up to 10M DAI. @PE has received draft audits from ChainSecurity finding no issues. Finalized audits will be provided in the coming two weeks. Protocol Engineering is therefore comfortable increasing the debt ceiling to 50M (hedged by the Surplus Buffer). This post is therefore proposing a DC increase to 50M next week and will go on to explain some of the D3M risks so that decisions about further increases can be easier in coming weeks. On our side we\u2019d like to make a few comments on D3M risks, although the majority was already covered in our D3M Risk Assessment. Before I get into details I would like to share a dashboard we made that lets us estimate the amount of D3M exposure at particular DC and Target Borrow Rates which are both governance parameters: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica. We are also working on a separate D3M monitoring dashboard that lets us monitor credit risks on Aave v2 DAI market and coverage of their Safety Module. As already mentioned in the initial Risk Assessment, we recommend limiting the D3M exposure at 20% of the Aave v2 DAI supply market. This puts the D3M DC at around 400m right now. This is because in equilibrium, the DAI market is always about 80% utilized (because of the rate curve of which the slope increases at 80% utilization) and we want to assure we don\u2019t face liquidity risks if Maker wanted to shut down the module for some particular reason. In reality we would want a bit more buffer and we\u2019d probably recommend up to 300m DC. Few words on credit risks: Aave v2 DAI market is about 80% utilized and therefore about 1.6bn DAI is borrowed out of 2bn DAI supplied. DAI being borrowed is collateralized by other assets, and this is the credit risk we are facing. However, a large part of DAI borrowed is collateralized by DAI (recursive leverage DAI liquidity mining) and is delta hedged. We estimated that only about 250m DAI (17%) out of 1.5bn borrowed is collateralized by volatile collateral. And majority of this collateral is either ETH or BTC. There is one larger loan collateralized by MKR, but doesn\u2019t seem large compared to the exposure. This means the DAI borrow market carries relatively low credit risk, currently.  Chart1200\u00d7742 47.3 KB  However things can change fast and Aave still doesn\u2019t have a concept of debt ceiling implemented. For instance, if the last exploit at Cream happened at Aave, the DAI market could be drained. The biggest risk of D3M is probably the inability of the module knowing that something is wrong at Aave and instead of pulling money out, it would supply additional DAI because the rates would spike in a bank run/exploit scenario. This is why we recommend caution and extra safety that can be somehow controlled by DC-IAM parameters and instant access of shutting down the module if needed. Few more words on Target Borrow rate which is currently set at 4%. Because of the DAI interest rate curve at Aave v2, the rate tends to somehow be in equilibrium around 4%. This is because rate significantly increases after 4% and 80% market utilization and forces the market to either repay DAI or supply more DAI and push rate back down to 4% range. We have observed many occasions where the rate is either slightly above 4% or slightly below. This is however annoying for Maker, because the D3M exposure would either be 0 or a positive number, making it less efficient and earning less. This is why we would recommend lowering the Target Borrow rate just slightly to 3.9%. This wouldn\u2019t change the competitive angle by too much, but significantly increase D3M ability to have constant exposure and earn fees.  964\u00d71016 42.7 KB  Risk Core Unit therefore proposes:  Increase D3M DC line to 50m Increase gap to 25m Lower Target Borrow Rate bar to 3.9%  Unless there are notable objections from the community or other mandated actors, we would like to include these changes in the on-chain poll next week.

                    "content": "    Primoz:  Unless there are notable objections from the community or other mandated actors, we would like to include these changes in the on-chain poll next week.   I would like to object, actually. Mostly on grounds of size of exposure and some worries I have (outlined below). Aave Backstop There are some worrisome whispers (from folks forking Aave on other chains) circulating that Aave\u2019s backstop will not perform as expected in the event of a large amount of bad debt. I would request that @Protocol-Engineering take a peek if they have not already done so. Additionally, Aave is extremely thinly capitalized. Discounting the boatload of AAVE, they have only $4m in reserves according to this as of today which is down substantially from the ~$25m seen in @Hasu and @monet-supply\u2019s recent article using data drawn from the same source. ETA: Looks like Aave has $22m in non-AAVE reserves, but the $4m is probably more accurate because it discounts a-tokens. aUSDC, for example, won\u2019t be much use to them if the bad debt is USDC ETA2: Actually looks like only around $400k in unwrapped tokens. For reasons I wholly agree with, Monet and Hasu argue that buffers in a native token (whether staked or printed) should be viewed somewhere between \u201cworth something\u201d and \u201cworth nothing\u201d that is hard to quantify and should not be relied upon. More generally, their financials are fairly opaque and do not help shed light on what is happening here. It\u2019s not clear how much (if any) money they actually make. Aave Risk Management Aside from the lack of buffer, I do not feel Aave has as rigorous risk management practices as Maker does. The fact that their AMPL market has been a basket case for several weeks and remains unresolved is a good example. That this problem is one of economic design and not technical oversight \u2013 the AMPL token rebasing messes with their rate curve, which should be no surprise \u2013 is not reassuring. The quick removal of liquidity earlier in the week also shows the ability for deposits to be locked in place at Aave, and in a market downturn, I suspect Aave is \u201csafe until it\u2019s not.\u201d The cross-collateralization of different tokens should make things safer, but likely increases the odds of a cascading event if a major collateral has problems. This is unlike Maker where if a single collateral type falls out of bed, the other vaults should be unaffected unless DAI breaks peg. Competition with PSM for capital flows The D3M module mints DAI that is either unbacked or backed by Aave\u2019s debt, depending upon your preferred semantics. This is fine. But it does mean that it competes with the PSMs for managing the size of DAI\u2019s monetary base. Ceteris paribus one would expect that 1 DAI minted via D3M to result in 1 DAI unwound from a PSM. Real life is, of course, messier than that, but the direction of the pressure is correct. When it comes to the PSMs, they are excellent tools at managing the peg and absorbing/providing liquidity for capital flows into/out of DAI when demand for DAI != demand for vaults. More specifically, they are automatic. This is actually much more efficient than what actual central banks do. The D3M, on the other hand, is meant to target a rate and do so imperfectly (because the market at Aave may be frozen or experience random gyrations unrelated to Maker\u2019s actions), which is much more like what the Federal Reserve and other central banks do. Unless we are very clear that the D3M is used mainly for revenue and keep it sized accordingly, we risk the D3M taking the lead on peg management. Because it presents liquidity risk and (in my opinion) greater credit risk, I think we should steadfastly establish a policy that the D3M is strictly for revenue and not monetary/peg policies. From a monetary/peg standpoint, the D3M should be seen as a substitute for bonds/Treasuries/other parking spaces, and we need an institutionalized rule to remind us of that. Keeping all D3Ms at some percentage of all PSMs is probably the correct solution here, and I would ask @Primoz to think about what that might look like. If that is hard coded into our process here, we can simply perform regular sweeps on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to keep these two tools in balance. Raise D3M at all? For now? I suspect we can increase it a bit, but I think 50m is too much. In an unlikely, worst-case scenario, that would leave Maker with less than a year\u2019s operating budget on hand. Given that the only D3M at the moment is with Aave, a catastrophic Aave event would likely impact our other business lines as well, and we would want to have that cushion. Our estimated expenses on an annualized basis are currently around $40million \u2013 I think we should make sure we always have that + some actual buffer for bad debt on hand. TLDR -Aave\u2019s risk management is questionable in my opinion, and they are the ultimate borrower -Aave looks broke and their financials don\u2019t suggest that will change -I advocate for a rule that keeps all aggregated D3Ms to a fixed % of all aggregated PSMs so as not to present liquidity problems in the face of unexpected failure of D3M counterparties ",

                    "content": "    PaperImperium:  Additionally, Aave is extremely thinly capitalized. Discounting the boatload of AAVE, they have only $4m in reserves according to this as of today  which is down substantially from the ~$25m seen in @Hasu and @monet-supply\u2019s recent article using data drawn from the same source.   I think this $4m reserves data you got is wrong, but I won\u2019t dispute that their capital is not as large and liquid as we would want it to be. Their other most liquid part of capital is in Balancers stkABPT pool, which consists of $95m ETH. Even though this looks to be more than Maker\u2019s current Surplus Buffer, it isn\u2019t stable and it is questionable how much of that ETH disappears through AAVE token dump before potential coverage of loss.     PaperImperium:  Ceteris paribus one would expect that 1 DAI minted via D3M to result in 1 DAI unwound from a PSM.   I don\u2019t see a clear connection between D3M and PSM. Sure someone might borrow this DAI on Aave and sell it for something else and drain PSM, but same holds for every DAI borrowed from whatever vault type at Maker? Why would this be a special case at 50m DC? And also people borrowing DAI might just farm with it somewhere (which is the case mostly) and this wouldn\u2019t impact the PSM. EDIT: I see where you are going - keeping DAI rates on Aave too low would stimulate DAI borrowing and unwinding of PSM. True, we\u2019d probably not want to overshoot with a DC and I think we won\u2019t with these numbers. If PSM starts draining to dangerous levels we\u2019ll simply lower D3M exposure in time? I think PSM drainage has more implications on fixed rate vaults than D3M though. All in all I don\u2019t see how these concerns would make a good argument not to increase DC. I personally think this DC is within the risk tolerance compared to all the other vault offerings at Maker, but I let the community decide. It is true that any black swan event (such as the one at Cream) can lead to bad debt and questionable coverage from their reserves. But if we start assessing every collateral with a black swan probability, we should probably put on brakes at many collaterals. Yet I do think we need a discussion when we start increasing DC above that figure. In the post I made I haven\u2019t even counted all the other risk factors that I would want community to weigh in, for instance:  how do we feel about increasing exposure to Chainlink Oracles indirectly? do we want to hold off with this cadence of DC increase until Aave implements debt ceilings that were rumoured to be implemented at some point - the biggest missing risk mitigation parameter at Aave IMO do we want a bigger protection against liquidity risks and ask Aave to implement a rate curve that lowers the \u201ckink\u201d from 80% utilization to something lower? do we want a lower gap parameter that protects us to some degree in the bank run scenario (assuming DC isn\u2019t fully utilized)? This makes D3M less efficient though and comes with other risks.  ",

Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves here. You have one community member voicing their opinion. This will go to a formal vote and MKR holders will have the ultimate say. Personally I\u2019m in favor of the 50M DC increase. Audits have come back clean and D3M is a critical piece of our distribution strategy for Dai. D3M has the potential to generate an enormous amount of revenue for the protocol. Short term spikes in rates were something Maker could never actually monetize because of our governance processes being extremely slow. D3M changes that. I\u2019m looking forward to those days where a new farm gets launched and Aave borrow rates spike up to 70%. A DC based on the utilization curve makes a lot more sense than trying to constrain it based off of  Aave\u2019s balance sheet. You\u2019re not going to find any DeFi protocols that are as well capitalized as Maker (tbf we\u2019re not even well capitalized). Should our appetite for risk evolve over time? Absolutely.

That this problem is one of economic design and not technical oversight \u2013 the AMPL token rebasing messes with their rate curve, which should be no surprise \u2013 is not reassuring.   Worth noting that this only impacts AMPL depositors, not the integrity or solvency of the rest of the Aave markets. So I think this partly explains why Aave hasn\u2019t taken more forceful action to adjust the aAMPL market (although I hope to see this resolved in the near future).     PaperImperium:  ETA: Looks like Aave has $22m in non-AAVE reserves, but the $4m is probably more accurate because it discounts a-tokens. aUSDC, for example, won\u2019t be much use to them if the bad debt is USDC ETA2: Actually looks like only around $400k in unwrapped tokens.   IMO it\u2019s not problematic for Aave to hold their reserves in aTokens, if the protocol faced losses it could either (1) forfeit their aTokens to reduce pool liabilities, or (2) deposit their reserves to increase pool assets. It should have equivalent impact either way. I also think the competition for PSM flows is possibly a good side effect of using the D3M - Maker earns a very low return on PSM assets (potentially 0% return if proposal to remove fees passes), D3M may offer a better risk adjusted return and also gives the ability to maintain profitability even if we need to activate the DSR to maintain DAI demand.

Dunno how old you are, but whatever decade you came of age, there was a financial crisis caused by some central bank trying to do exactly what you describe. For me, it was the Asian Financial Crisis. Thailand\u2019s central bank was targeting an interest rate that caused their version of PSM to empty, their exchange rate was forced to float, and lots of countries had a really, really bad time, We can definitely use D3M as a supplement to the PSM. But targeting an interest rate is literally the worst thing we can do for peg maintenance because we have to (in real time) get it exactly right. Getting it wrong results in capital flight from DAI, and the more we empty the PSMs, the closer we are to going under peg. And despite what people will say about DSR, that also cannot be used to infinity because eventually the SB runs out of money as well. It\u2019s just very important that people understand that simultaneously targeting a fixed exchange rate and interest rates is what central banks do in the places we promote DAI as a solution today. It cannot be done for any length of time because it costs money. If we run out, we\u2019d have to print new money (D3M) to maintain it, which would of course make it harder to keep our peg and it all spirals out of control until bankruptcy or sharp currency devaluation.

But I disagree with the assumption that we must have the ability to withdraw it all at once, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at all just like we are not expecting to instantly liquidate all of our ETH-A vaults at once. I think we should eventually go much higher, and IMO try to enforce a borrowing rate of 1% above our ETH-A vaults on Aave, and later Compound We are getting the audits, and we need to observe this thing in a live environment for some time to build confidence. But beyond that, I really can\u2019t stress how much I believe this is not the time to be squeamish or get analysis paralysis. Maker needs to grow to build critical mass to handle all of the external shocks that will come. In addition to Staked ETH, the DDMs are by far the most powerful tool we have available to facilitate this expansion. Considering how much DDMs for Aave and Compound would allow us to boost the value creation of the protocol, we need to focus on pragmatic and realistic risk and practical actions we can take to avert it, and then move as quickly as is reasonable to capture that value.

This probably wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to AAVE because the point of the interest rate curve is to incentivize liquidity properly, which is less of a concern with D3M. In particular, I think setting optimal utilization and slope 1 higher of the interest rate curve would benefit D3M dramatically with little to no risk consequence for AAVE. The job of optimal utilization would essentially shift from AAVE to Maker, with AAVE\u2019s parameter as a backstop. ",

IMO micromanagement via signal request should be avoided as much as possible. Either the arguments from the community makes sense or they don\u2019t. The community can help provide input on what would provide greater value, but at the same time has very little knowledge about how long a particular task takes. So all in all in most cases the community has no business trying to micromanage core unit prioritisation and should instead focus on spelling out principles and values and let the CUs execute based on those. I\u2019m strongly pro compound D3M (of course, its pretty obvious that its extremely high value just like the aave D3M), but again it really should be up to your own expertise to prioritize based on your specialized knowledge in my opinion. Forum micromanagement just seems like it will take us in such a bad direction both in terms of workplace satisfaction, but also since it means core units wont really have to be held accountable for bad prioritization either since they can just blame the community for signal request micromanagement. Core units should take in as much input and feedback as possible when making prioritization decisions, but the final decision should ultimately be up to them. Maybe a more useful use of signal requests would be to have the community rank the expected value of different features that PE has on the roadmap, and then still let PE prioritize based on their knowledge of the workload required for each. So its not just saying yes to things we like, you have to realize that it\u2019s a tradeoff and when you say yes to one thing, you say no to something else. ",
