This will be a good opportunity for a longer hacking period, allowing for EIPs and ethereum long term issues to be the focus. Our friends at Colony have already had a great remote hackathon and to start I have forked their repo and began filling in the gaps. The reason I bring this up specifically before the Council of Prague is to allow for us to have the opportunity to invite people to join the hackathon during Prague Blockchain Week. To start it would be great if people indicate their interest in contributing to the larger organization of the hackathon. After we have a better idea of who wants to organize the hackathon, it would be great to plan a call for sometime next week. For now there are no concrete dates regarding anything. Thanks! ",

                    "content": "Hey folks! I have attempted to summarize @chrishobcroft\u2019s notes from our ring into a template/proposal for how a remoteHackathon could work. Intro The aim is to create a tangible template that reinvigorates our local communities - as some kind of valuable output of tangible energy back into our own local communities. Proposal As a starting point, I would like to expand on the previously stated 2 month hackathon timeline from a high level.  Split into 2 halves, the hackathon can begin with 1 month dedicated to local meetups.   The meetup period should be expected to have a minimum of two educational meetups dedicated to onboarding new developers, designers, researchers, etc\u2026 Meetups should also live stream these events to allow for remote participants to learn as well. By the end of the first meetup, participants should begin engaging in the wider remoteHackathon community, proposing hackathon project ideas that may be collaborated on by members of different communities. The intention is for these meetups to cater to the needs of local communities while engaging in the wider Ethereum ecosystem for support during the hackathon. Building relationships that could last a lifetime.   Hackathon   The hackathon period should have a minimum of two hacking sessions, where hackers and mentors can come together to solve problems. Hackers and mentors should be continuing the conversation online throughout the hackathon at ethereum-magicians.org allowing everyone to learn together from the problems being encountered. A decentralized group of mentors will be available to answer these questions.  Conclusion The intention for this is to create a template for a series of events that empower local communities to take part in, while allowing for wider Ethereum support. At the moment we have a repo forked from Colony (https://github.com/ChainSafe/remoteHackathon), this is by no means done, it is just a template to get us started. I will transfer it to the FEM github when necessary. Please join the conversation by adding to the proposal or making your own. We need people to turn intention into action by pledging to bringing this initiative to your local community. Notes from the Council of Prague ring that might be relevant \"Interest in how to connect into localized creative communities, outside the Blockchain space, which already have space / funding / shared community values - and seek to support these communities (example in Reno, Berlin). Aim to balance the focus of bringing a \u201chackathon\u201d ethos to building (fun, experimental), with real-life use-cases to support communities. Important to create some kind of vision, but also leave space for less \u201cplanned\u201d activities or objectives - i.e. accepting that we don\u2019t know all the answers yet. Spreading the teaching of the information about what tools exist in our community, and empower / enable others to build. In order to convince someone to go to a localised hackathon, there needs to be some kind of incentive. However, connection to e.g. ETH Magicians, can potentially help to bring some \u201cbig speakers\u201d to attract hackers. The travel / accommodation costs for \u201cbig speakers\u201d might end up being the only funding needed. Another thing to draw in hackers is to encourage participation from projects already building in this space, in order to provide skilled resources to help hackers when they get stuck etc.\" Thanks you everyone for your interest in this! As the last action item states \u201cTake this idea back to your communities - IT\u2019S UP TO YOU TO START TO BUILD THE MOVEMENT\u201d ",
