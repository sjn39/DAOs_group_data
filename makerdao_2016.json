Students are encouraged to explore and trailblaze on any potential new frontiers. As blockchain technology is still maturing and adoption is rapidly increasing, continuous education and development should be established. For mainstream adoption to be achieved, strategic planning as well as proper decision making and marketing is required. Therefore, by establishing a research lab (EPI) to synergise the growth of MakerDAO, by governance participation, with the exposure to blockchain technology and decentralised finance, this would provide a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship between MakerDAO and the University. The delegator will be led by a University researcher with student volunteers (Research lab), the research lab is expected to be fully vested in the governance of MakerDAO and communications with delegators will be communicated on a frequent and timely basis. The research lab will be solely responsible for Governance matters to MakerDAO with assistance from other Faculty members on other matters such as, Research, Education, Business Development and Web3 developments. HKUST-EPI has plans to participate in governance matters in other protocols. This research lab will share updates regarding new proposals internally and will discuss them before reaching a decisive vote. This decision making process will take place internally via simple majority either in person or via electronic communication mediums. Decisions will be made in time to ascertain full participation in the governance proposals. The governance initiatives are:  Active participation in discussion forums Initiating new improvements proposals Monitoring of news and updates Seek consultations with respective faculty members or with collaborating external parties Communication with internal team members Open communications and Q&A with delegators when time permits  HKUST-EPI sincerely encourages all MakerDAO stakeholders to delegate with the research lab to have a greater stake and voting power in the decision making process. By leveraging on our resources and connections to bring the protocol to greater glory. With our research lab of individuals with unique perspectives, industry experience and knowledge, rest assured that the choice of delegating with HKUSE-EPI, as your preferred recognized delegate, will be a positive experience.  Conflicts of Interest  Team members may have small stake in MakerDAO Consultations with other teams in charge of governance of other protocols Consultations with external collaborators  HKUST-EPI has read and agreed to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of liability By delegating to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, you acknowledge and agree that Hong Kong University of Science and Technology will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.

Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln We voted to support a 0.5M burn, as we view that the burning of MKR is beneficial to the existing MKR holders by returning some value back to the MKR holders by the protocol. As well as, providing certain confidence to them regarding the MAKER protocol. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal We voted YES to the poll to change the parameters:  WSTETH-B - Increase in stability fees will bring more revenue to the protocol. Inline with the end game plan to amass a store of StETH, beneficial to start charging a fee to borrow against it. In addition, we view that with an increasing stability fee imposed to the vaults would be a barrier to borrowers to maintain large positions. hence reducing overall risk to the vault during a crash in asset prices. D3M - Reactivation or increase in the D3M parameters will again bring more revenue to the protocol and it will be beneficial to utilise the short term rally in the market to increase these revenues. USDP - Increase of the entry borrowing fee would be beneficial to deter short term borrowers as the barrier of entry has been adjusted upwards.  ",

                    "content": "Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling  We decided to vote for the decrease of the GUSD PSM to 0DAI  The backing of the GUSD is unsecured and undetermined if it will be impacted by the Gemini Earn issue and investigations with the DOJ and SEC. Silvergate is also a bank used by Gemini which has been in a liquidity crunch due to a bank run. Hence, there is a risk to whether the FDIC will step in to insure the collateral. We expect this to be highly unlikely.    Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout)  We voted YES  To encourage frictionless closure of GUSD positions    Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment  We support the poll to change the parameters:  The clarification of the MIP63 documentation will lower the risk of any errors or unwanted issues when onboarding any new Keep Networks to maintain certain functions of the protocol.    Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14)  We voted NO  As we view that imposing a reimbursing fund like this will encourage litigation to CUs and Delegates. Hence depleting the funds at an accelerated rate. Therefore, reserves will be depleted if frequent top-ups are performed.    Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92)  We voted YES  The increase in revenue will be beneficial to MAKER, but the risk from smart contracts interactions and various possible attacks (oracles and flashloans, etc) should be assessed. the strategy with the bespoke vault need to be scrutinised as well, as no concrete strategy has been shared to the forums.    Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13)  We voted YES  We agree that the RWA requires a dedicated CU to monitor the deliverables and contractual obligations from the RWA arrangers or counterparties. As MAKER will be subjected to asymmetrical information due to any lapses in the obligations of the counterparty. We eagerly await the applicants and their budget requests.    Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5)  We voted YES  We view having Chainlink as a Keeper Network to provide maintenance for simple task for MAKER to be beneficial to the protocol. Voted parameters and updates on Oracles can be performed on a more timely basis using Chainlink as the form of automation.    Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13)  We voted NO  We agree that performance of all RWAs should be tracked and monitored including their submission of the contractual deliverables. But monitoring should not be siloed and should be covering all RWAs.    Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12)  We voted YES  We view that monitoring RWA is in urgent need. Strategic finance fits the role and has the skills to perform such matters on the entire RWA portfolio of the protocol.    Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (MIP14c2-SP2)  We voted YES  We view that the request for 43k for a 6months runway for the CU to operate is within reasonable means. Where the CU will transit into a METAdao which is excitingly inline with the Endgame plan.    Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1)  We voted YES  We view that the request for 139k for a 2 months runway for the CU to operate is within reasonable means. We look forward to assessing the revised budget in March 2023.    Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7)  We appreciate the efforts of the CU in providing bridging information from the various CUs and other governance members to the community.  We support the CU preferred parachute amounts.    Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32)  We support the endgame plan and we recognise that the limit is an issue.  Removing this issue allows for fund requests to be disbursed in a more timely manner.    Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3)  We agree that the MIPs are obsolete. It is appreciated to have regular housekeeping of MIPs.  Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2)  We disagree that the MIP14 is obsolete. The procedure and limits should be in place for the foreseeable future when more fund request will be performed for METADAOs and other protocol related functions and operations. The limits should be removed to cater for the increase in market rate for remuneration and expenses.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28)  We disagree with removing MIP51c4.  We understand that there is diversity in the community and more people can cover each other\u2019s tasks. As December has multiple holidays we believe individuals who do not partake in the festive cheers do utilise this time to relax or visit their family. It is only fair for them to be able to do so. Nonetheless, should any emergencies arise, urgent executive polling is always available.    Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29)  We agree with the ratification on both issues  Abstaining votes serve no purpose and benefit to the governance. View to be low effort delegates and leeching the funds from the protocol. Executive votes are important and voting power should be based on participation.    ",
