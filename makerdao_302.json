[12] For example, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission concludes the vast majority of their nuclear sites have already experienced flooding hazard beyond their design-base. [13] And a recent US Army War College report states that nuclear power facilities are at \u2018high risk\u2019 of temporary or permanent closure due to climate threats - with 60 percent of US nuclear capacity now vulnerable to sea-level rise, severe storms, and cooling water shortages.
