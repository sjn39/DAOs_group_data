Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more USDC which is deposited back into the strategy. GUNIV3USDC-DAI: Supplies USDC to Maker DAO Peg Stability Module to feelessly get the correct USDC-DAI ratio then it deposits to Arrakis Finance\u2019s Univ3daiusdc Vault 5, which autocompounds a Uniswap v3 DAI-USDC position. Afterwards, it uses this Vault token as collateral at Maker DAO. Flashmints are used to mint DAI from MakerDAO to flashlend and fold the position, boosting the APY. Earned tokens are harvested and sold for more USDC, which is deposited back into the strategy. GenLevComp v3: Supplies and borrows USDC on Compound Finance simultaneously to earn COMP. Flashmints are used to mint DAI from MakerDAO to flashlend and fold the position, boosting the APY. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more USDC which is deposited back into the strategy.  Deposit Limits: Each of above strategy should have a deposit limit of 1,000,000 PSM USDC. Therefore, in total, 3,000,000 PSM USDC limit.  Motivation As MIP92: Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield noted \u201cA list of investment strategies that the vault might adopt is proposed. Choices of which strategies to pursue, deposit limits, debt ratios, and corresponding risk profiles are controlled by Maker Governance.\u201d Considering MIP92 has passed, we believe that such onboarding should take step by step especially with strategies that the Maker protocol already has exposure to and thus can be understood as more \u201ccomfortable\u201d to deploy. And Maker already has exposure to both AAVE, Compound Finance, and Uniswap LP. ",

This subproposal recommends three strategies, each with a deposit limit of 1M USDC. In total, 3M USDC will be used by the three strategies. The three strategies are:  Supply USDC to AAVE to earn interest. Obtain GUNIV3USDC-DAI LP tokens using USDC and the USDC PSM. Deposit this LP token into Arrakis Finance vaults (note that these are under beta testing), which autocompounds a Uniswap v3 DAI-USDC position. Finally, use the DAI-USDC LP tokens as collateral to open a MakerDAO Vault. Supply and borrow USDC on Compound Finance simultaneously to earn COMP. All strategies take earned tokens and sell them for more USDC, which is deposited back into the strategy. Flashmints are also used by the second and third strategy to boost yield.   This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth.
