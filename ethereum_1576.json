EIP-649 established a delay in the difficulty bomb and reduced the block reward as part of the Byzantium fork. The bomb was originally included in the metropolis HF with the intent to provide leverage in the transition to PoS as there was not a clear governance process in place to enforce the project roadmap and was to be used to make mining increasingly unprofitable. In the interim 2 years the community has grown considerably and the transition to PoS is now a universally understood matter of \u2018when\u2019 not \u2018if\u2019. As it is currently implemented, under EIP-649, the difficulty bomb will soon begin to become a determent to network difficulty and block time again. As such, the Constantinople fork is the logical junction to implement a change in the bomb. Two opposed EIPs have been suggested, EIP-1234 and EIP-1227. EIP-1234 Abstract: Starting with CNSTNTNPL_FORK_BLKNUM the client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting around 6 million blocks later than previously specified with the Homestead fork. Furthermore, block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 2 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly. EIP-1227 Abstract: Starting with FORK_BLKNUM the client will calculate the difficulty without the additional exponential component. Furthermore, block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 5 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly.

Miners should have no issue with accepting this as it is in their interest - however, if we would also like to reduce issuance to 1-2 ETH then it would make sense to bundle this with a bomb delay.  As @dontpanic says, this is similar to 649 in that it is a give-and-take proposal. I have never seen any objection to the argument that issuance should be as low as possible while still maintaining blockchain security.  Reducing the block reward from 3 to 2 could cause security concerns if the price of ETH remains the same or falls.  If price of ETH increases to compensate the reduced block reward, we will not have achieved anything in terms of the fiat inflation rate of the chain (but this is clearly in the interest of investors). I do no think decisions about protocol changes should consider what is in the best interest of investors/money.  Thus, I can only see an issuance reduction as a potential security risk OR financially motivated with no real impact on inflation.  For this reason, I think the block reward should be a separate proposal form the difficulty bomb delay, so that I may support the bomb delay and not support the issuance change. ",

You can certainly frame things in which miners are the ultimate power though, in that economic participants literally cannot participate unless miners allow the blockchain to exist.  This is probably not realistic nowadays since mining is too profitable an activity to expect altruistic or irrational financial decisions form them. To expand on your point though, if economic participants are the primary driver for what exists and is worth anything, why do they have no impact on the actual development decisions?  Nick Johnson just said the other day quote:  Ultimately the only way the community can accept or reject a change is by running, or refusing to run, the code. There\u2019s no way to reliably measure the popularity of a proposed change (to the degree where you can be sure it\u2019s not worth implementing), and trying to do so would simply bog the EIP process down with a political process - most likely resulting in people switching to a new way to agree on changes that doesn\u2019t impose massive overhead.     reddit    r/ethereum - Changes are being made to the EIP process which remove the need for... 49 votes and 205 comments so far on Reddit      Where is the disconnect here?  Is it economic participants, miners, or core devs who call the shots?  Again, not the time or place to hash this out, but this is my broken record reminder that miners absolutely do have a say in what they mine, especially when the economic participants have decided that there are other profitable (and not that far off) blockchains to go mine with the same hardware.

If you split this, you end up modifying issuance. The goal of bundling it in one EIP aims at maintaining a stable issuance.   If the block reward is intended to be stable by time (not blocks) then the algorithm should be changed to not have difficulty as an independent variable and instead use time as the independent variable.  That could be an EIP just as easily as this one.  By conflating these two issues, you are conflating discussion about them.  As an economic participant, I am an advocate of removing the difficulty bombs entirely and also of reducing the block reward.  Rather than having 4 EIPs with all 4 combinations of such, we can have two EIPs that are isolated from each other and can be evaluated and discussed separately. We have seen discussions around block reward/difficulty bomb EIPs degrade in the past and this is partly because they keep getting proposed as two-in-ones like this. ",

I know you are trying to strike a balance to ensure the miner community accepts the mining reward changes and difficulty bomb. I have a solution that I think would make this a lot easier. To be quite honest most GPU miners are now barely breaking even after electricity costs due to the current state of the market and increased ASIC mining pushing up difficulty. Any reduction in rewards without a likewise reduction in difficulty would leave only ASICs on your network. I think I can speak for the mining community by saying we would be extremely open to outright reductions in rewards with the difficulty bomb reward removal if you were to include an anti ASIC POW mining algorithm change simultaneously. We know once ASICs are off the network we will again be on equal footing with other fellow GPU miners and profits should resume to where we are not mining for a loss. I realize Anti ASIC POW change was part of an EIP a few months back but you never finished the work but did agree it would need to be part of a fork with other EIPs. It seems this would be the best time to implement a POW algorithm change along side the reward reduction and difficulty bomb removal. I know you would hands down win over the mining community if you finally took serious the amount of profits ASICs are costing the community and forked them off. ",
