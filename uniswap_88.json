                    "content": "Previous Temperature Check Discussion Previous Temperature Check Snapshot Poll  TL;DR: Raise the quorum threshold to 60M. We believe that this would represent a measured raise in the quorum threshold that not only reflects recent turnout numbers but also takes into account the increased risks of delegate abstention as a substitute for \u201cNO\u201d votes if the quorum is raised too high.  Motivation Based on the Snapshot vote and discussion in the temperature check, there does seem to be some community support for increasing the quorum threshold in principle. The outstanding question, therefore, seems to be what number the threshold should be raised to. If we view the decision around raising the quorum threshold in the context of the UNI release schedule, which is pictured below, it is easy to assume that the number of delegated votes will only increase from here as investors and the team see UNI vest and as more and more Treasury UNI is distributed through grants and other programs.  1600\u00d71035 124 KB  Moreover, with both the vote for the Defi Education Fund and the lowering of the proposal threshold seeing over 90M UNI in participation, it is clear that the current quorum threshold of 40M is on the low side. Proven high voter turnout means that a higher quorum can quite easily be reached and so rather than making the passage of proposals more difficult, raising the quorum threshold would more so ensure that there is sufficient amounts of consensus before any proposal passes. A risk with a threshold of only 40M UNI, as it is in the status quo, is that lower quality proposals will have an easier time getting passed. Thus the quorum threshold should be raised to help ensure that proposals that pass reach a higher bar of quality. With that said, @derek raised a great point in our Temperature Check pointing out that raising the quorum threshold might result in delegates abstaining from voting to prevent a proposal from passing. This is not ideal because in the spirit of transparency, voters/delegates should own up to their decisions if they are against a proposal rather than being given the opportunity to abstain and hide their opinion. In short, a low threshold forces large token-holders and large delegates to be actively involved in the governance process. It should be noted, however, that this risk is arguably mitigated by the fact that tools like Tally, Sybil, and Boardroom provide transparency on delegate voting activity. This makes it possible to call out and delegate votes away from actors who continuously abstain. Keeping the above in mind, we therefore believe the threshold should be raised given, on balance, the benefits of raising the quorum to ensure proper consensus is met outweighs the potential harms of delegate abstention.  Specification: We believe the best approach is to raise the quorum threshold in a measured way to 60M. Given that all three successful Uniswap proposals so far have reached at least 60M YES votes, with turnout surpassing ~90M in the previous two proposals, 60M is a balanced quorum level that accounts for this higher turnout while also accounting for the increased risk of voter abstention.  Snapshot: The Snap Poll for the consensus check will be live for 4 days, from 22:00 EST on July 6th. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the next phase. A link to our snapshot proposal: Snapshot ",

How does this proposed increased quorum of 60M compare to the largest blocks of votes (in the five historical votes that were held)?

                    "content": "Thanks Pinotio.com for your engagement. Absolutely, would love to clarify. The proposal is not stemming from one specific incident, but rather a growing trend towards increased vote delegation and governance participation to the extent that a 40M UNI quorum is now too low as a bar to ensure proper consensus. Relevant to 2), historical participation stats on the five historical governance proposals ordered from most recent to oldest: DeFi Education Fund (June 2021): 79.6M FOR, 15M AGAINST Reduce proposal submission threshold (June 2021): 90M FOR, 0M AGAINST Uniswap Grants (December 2020): 60M FOR, 0M AGAINST Retroactive Proxy Airdrop (November 2020): 37.5M FOR, 1.2M AGAINST Reduce submission and quorum threshold (October 2020): 39.5M FOR, 0.7M AGAINST It is clear that the quorum must be raised from the initial 40M threshold in September 2020, given the recent participation rates of >90M UNI. Even back in December, participation had reached 60M. In response to 1), it would be great if you could clarify what you mean by a more dynamic approach. Currently, even if a proposal surpasses the quorum threshold, it must still achieve a majority FOR to be passed. For example, with a 40M quorum in place (status quo), if a proposal gets 50M FOR and 51M AGAINST, it won\u2019t be able to pass as it has not fetched a majority of all outstanding votes. We won\u2019t be changing this mechanism. The quorum threshold simply acts as a safety net. For example, with a 40M quorum in place, if a proposal gets 30M FOR and 25M AGAINST, despite achieving majority approval the proposal would not be able to pass as it has not yet reached the quorum.

This way, as we go out in time and more UNI is issued, there is less of a need to keep increasing the numerical value of the quorum threshold via governance proposals. For example, if outstanding UNI is 100M, the quorum is 51M. When it increases to 200M UNI outstanding, the quorum would automatically adjust to 102M UNI. Size of large UNI voters Do you have information on how big (measured in million UNI) were the largest blocks of votes in each of the five prior proposals? I think this is also useful information for deciding where the quorum should be. Thought on size of quorum I\u2019m not sure the quorum needs to be very large. There is a defined voting process that takes some days. So I don\u2019t see how small groups can easily get a proposal through. Ultimately, the rest of the community will know and can just vote against. Maybe I\u2019m missing a specific concern that you see? ",

                    "content": " TL;DR: Raise the proposal quorum threshold from 40M because recent voting participation is much higher and there is a lot of UNI that has been delegated  Summary: With around 183M UNI delegated at this time (which represents a large increase from even just 6 months ago), the original quorum threshold of 40 million now makes little sense since it can be easily reached through only a few delegates participating in a given vote. In addition, prominent members of the community have voiced their support including Hayden Adams.  Motivation: The underlying purpose of a quorum is to ensure there is a sufficient amount of community consensus before a proposal can be passed. A low threshold therefore allows proposals to be passed even without support from a majority of the community; given this, Penn Blockchain believes the quorum threshold should be raised. Although one could object that having such a high quorum threshold requires an overly optimistic level of voting participation and makes it harder for the community to pass any proposals, we have seen historically high levels of participation with over 90 million UNI voting on the last proposal to lower the proposal threshold; and the heavily discussed @HarvardLawBFI proposal to create the DeFi Education Fund will likely also see a large amount of voter turnout. This therefore means that a higher quorum can quite easily be reached and so rather than making the passage of proposals more difficult, raising the quorum threshold would more so ensure that there is sufficient amounts of consensus before any proposal passes.  Specification: We believe that a more appropriate quorum threshold would be in the range of ~60-70M UNI but this should be discussed.  Snapshot: The Snap Poll will be live for 4 days, from June 18th until June 22nd at 7:00 PM EST. If the poll passes with a minimum of 25,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the consensus check phase. A link to our snapshot proposal: Snapshot ",

Given the number of votes delegated has more than doubled, I think setting it to 75M or 80M would not be a bad idea. Perhaps it would be helpful to see how many votes the @HarvardLawBFI proposal see once it\u2019s posted and use that as a guide.  do think 75M/80M wouldn\u2019t be a bad move though. ",

One argument against increasing the quorum threshold is a lower threshold makes it more important for large token-holders to be actively involved in the governance process. Since the current quorum is 40m votes and majority vote (e.g., a 45m yes vote, 70m no vote wouldn\u2019t pass), keeping the current quorum may actually result in a more active, involved governance process. Increasing the threshold a large degree makes it easier for token-holders to abstain, which could be argued is undesirable. Overall, don\u2019t feel super strongly one way or the other here, but would be cognizant of the risks of raising the quorum too high. I\u2019m in support of this as a temp check (it\u2019s already passed), but worth discussing this aspect more in the consensus check. ",
