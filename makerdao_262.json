                    "content": " Multi-chain DAI-lights DeFi Fall\u2019s been bridge-centric, with each week seeing a new top off-chain Dai holder. This week was no different - DeFi\u2019s back, but with more bridges to cross and places to go.  Bridging Avalanche and Fantom have had a nice back-and-forth in a battle for liquidity, but this week saw some decisive action.   The Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge now holds around 330 million Dai or 98.6% of all DAI bridged to Avalanche.   The AnySwap Bridge isn\u2019t too far behind, with over 203 million in locked Dai - good for 89.6% of Dai bridged to Fantom.   In a multi-chain world - layer-2 solutions, bridge security, and Dai liquidity are topics worth further exploring. I\u2019m working on a separate post to dive into this further.  Avalanche Avalanche Rush apparently just started a bit late. After an underwhelming launch, the chain has fully rebounded - and it has Banker Joe to thank. Trader Joe launched an unannounced borrowing and lending market, throwing Joe into the money market mix. The news saw Joe lock in over $1bil in TVL and 98mil DAI. Despite the launch, Aave is still Avalanche\u2019s top money market, with nearly 182 million Dai locked into its contract - and through the protocol, users have generated around 607 million in leveraged Dai. Over 333 million Dai now calls Avalanche home, or 4.21% of the total supply.  Fantom The Fantom ecosystem is popping across the board - movement that\u2019s seen Geist retake liquidity dominance on the chain. The Aave-clone has over 118 million Dai locked in its contract, and through the protocol, users have generated around 536 million in leveraged Dai. After another week of decline, Fantom now holds around 227 million Dai or 2.8% of the total supply.  Circulating Dai by Platform As of October 28, 2021  By Platform576\u00d7639 28.1 KB   Notes Have anything you\u2019d like to see added to these breakdowns? Leave a message in the comments or DM me, @seth, or @JerryAG. Stay tuned for a breakdown on where to USE Dai on these chains. Thanks for reading! This is for informational purposes only.

For lending specifically, SCREAM is worth a look over Geist\u2026 but of course, not financial advice. Beefy\u2019s also stacking - currently over 72mil in pooled Dai. Another one worth keeping an eye on is Tomb, who found themselves on rekt.news back in September. Looks like they relaunched and are up to 238mil in TVL\u2026 ",

Need to look more into Beethoven - some interesting pools on there\u2026 That $200-300mil TVL range is pretty interesting for sure. Should be fun watching it all shake out. ",
