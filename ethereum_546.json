I create this topic connected to the project called @pando_network witch is currently developing a decentralized GitHub where each repo can be controlled by an AragonDAO. As the project is open-source https://github.com/ryhope/pando I thought it would be nice to create a dedicated topic A first description of the tool is available here : https://medium.com/ryhope-network/pando-b5e1a2af3152 And in more general way here : https://medium.com/ryhope-network/the-pando-network-ff385f2be05a This project contains many new features that can\u2019t be found on any other VCS that you may want to discuss. Such as \u00ab individuation \u00bb / \u00ab Lineage \u00bb and so on. You can take a look at those functions here:    Aragon Project blog \u2013 19 Nov 18    Nest: Pando Q3 Update This second milestone was quite busy       The project has also already implemented governance KIT for the collective management of repo such as DictatorKit (Enforce a maintainer-based governance \u00e0-la GitHub ) VotingKit (Enforce a Native Lineage Token-backed democratic governance to sort and valuate requests) These governance kits for the collective management of repo is a major step forward regarding to GitHub\u2019s workflow and I think that this will eventually lead to discussions or participations.
