For example, I\u2019ve contributed to Ethereum Genesis sale on ethereum.org, but lost access to the genesis wallets containing 3325.11 ETH, as described in [1], and [2]. So, basically, I\u2019ve contributed to the creation Ethereum, but I\u2019m left with nothing. I would like to create of a Genesis Ether recovery toolkit for ethereum.org website, that would allow an arbitrary Ethereum address holder to go into smart contract with the ethereum.org organization (where the Ether Sale happened), based on constructing a proof of one\u2019s identity based on oracles, like Bitcoin, Cryptsy and Gmail, as I still hold passwords and access keys to those systems, and would like to use them to prove sameness of human identity. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts on a protocol for Genesis Ether recovery based on external facts, because, as described in [1], [2], I had made the password really long (I guess approx 64 chars long), and split it into two parts, one part on a paper (that I still have), and another part on computer (that I lost irrecoverably). With such long passwords, I have no hope in direct cryptographic proof, and therefore the topic. Thanks! ",

The topic of fund recovery has been discussed at length in the past (see EIP-867). There is no desire to introduce a mechanism into the protocol that allows for stuck funds to be recovered. This is for many reasons, but we shouldn\u2019t rehash here. I recommend you read the prior discussions on the topic. ",

My immediate assumption was:   Ok, you ask me password for backups, because you\u2019ll be sending those backups to my e-mail address \u2013 I can understand that, \u2013 to prevent mail provider from peeping into my wallet.   But, what I had saved directly from ethereum.org is the wallet in pure unencrypted form (cause, why would one need to encrypt something from me? I\u2019m not the 3rd party like my mail provider is.)   The reality was:   They sent the encrypted wallets to mail provided.   They also encrypted the wallet before I could save it to my disk.   So, even after finding the original file, that I saved not from backup, but the very very original, I could not use it\u2026  UX: I\u2019m given the thing, where I thought I made password just for backups, but in reality, this password also was used to encrypt me the original. So, your generator never gave me the original private key! Which is, unfair\u2026 I paid for it, but did not get it. ",
