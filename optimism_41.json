BrightID might be a good option as one can get verified without providing any personal details, its not 100% full proof but its something.  Proof of Humanity comes under same category and but they require some initial fund and lot personal details which I dont support it. One thing is clear, it cant be on the basis of single thing. I am willing to attend and meet OP ecosystem conferences and meetups to prove my citizenship, here I believe my privacy is more preserved, but I am against creating a profile on PoH page as it exposes me to a unnecessary wider audience. Those felling comfortable, sure go ahead but what about audience like me ? Other helping factor might be involvement of the said citizen on this gov portal. I see citizens as someone who is part of the ecosystem and i would expect them to participate and show their involvement. Ideally, thats the end goal right? participation. ",
