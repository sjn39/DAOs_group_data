Experiential marketing is a highly utilized method for brand promotion and is employed by many companies and co-operations across all industries. This is a technique that takes time to measure results but with persistence and planning grows exponentially. Results can already be seen with our Twitter engagement (below). Associating MakerDAO and DAI with a positive experience is invaluable for the brand, existing clients and newcomers to the space. This is a tried and tested strategy that yields incredible results over time.  DAIvinity EthCC Recap For those who missed the event, we have compiled this recap video of the night.  Twitter - @daivinity   As you can see our impressions are growing rapidly since the formation of the CU to the EthCC Paris event. These numbers clearly show the interest in our events along with MakerDAO in the space of only 3 months. This trend will only continue upon the successful execution of future planned events.  Likewise, this can also be seen in our engagement rate. We have strategically been tweeting during the build-up to events to give away tickets. This subsequently has resulted in an extremely high engagement rate, translating to high demand for tickets to our events. In July you can see we had a total of 17089 engagements. During this month we had a total following of 1526.  As stated in other CU updates a target engagement rate % per month for twitter is around 1-2%. Anything over 5% is considered exceptional. We have yet to dip below 5% since May with the run-up to EthCC in June soring above 8%. As our Twitter presence continues to grow and our events create a continued buzz in the community we expect this engagement rate to continue. Our rapid growth is also being noticed within the space:  1202\u00d7912 153 KB   Roadmap Update  ETH Warsaw - Sept 1st DAIvinity Warsaw is set to take place on September 1.  This event has been coordinated with Eth Warsaw to be the official opening event of the conference.  The team has arranged for the event to be hosted up in the sky at Level 27.  As usual, there has been a high demand for tickets and being in eastern Europe will allow Maker to be exposed to a different client base.  DEVCon (Bogota) - Oct 13th The team has been working on this event for some time.  There is plenty of logistical issues which have been very challenging.  Despite these challenges, we have secured a venue and a date for the event.  Oct 13 DAIvinity will debut in South America!!!  We will be focusing the next month on the logistical details and partnership arrangements for this event.  Financial  CU Expenses (YTD)  1756\u00d71148 475 KB  *****The actuals for June are different than what was reported by SF,  This was my error.  This has been corrected here and I have notified SF of the mistake.  DAIvinity EthCC Revenue & Expenses From the DAIvinity EthCC event, the CU had total revenue of 64,000 DAI/USDC.  Our target is to cost split 50% of the event budget (110,000 DAI) with our partners so this revenue is exactly in line with our goals.  As stated before the revenue will be returned to the surplus buffer.  7,020 of this won\u2019t be sent back as it was essentially a wash as it was used to directly fund an extension of the event budget.  The budget extension was due to a high number of partners for the event so we extended the event capacity to the maximum.  This was funded from partnership revenue.  Here is a summary of the revenue and expenses for the event.      Expense/Revenue Budget Expense/Revenue Actual Differance     DAIvinity EthCC Total Cost -110,000 -117,020 106.38%   Partnership Revenue 55,000 64,000 116.36%   Total Cost -55,000 -53,020 96.40%    So where is this revenue currently?  Technically it is sitting in the surplus buffer.  What we have been doing is directing the revenue into our CU operational wallet and pulling expenses directly from that revenue.  This has had the result of us not pulling a vest from our DAI stream.  Eventually, 55,000 DAI will be pulled from the stream and then transferred it back to the surplus, effectively burning it from our stream.  Target is the end of Aug.  This will be the approach with all future revenue.  Overages YTD Higher than forecast but generally not an issue.  This is a result of some liabilities planned for Aug but moved to July.  The additional expenses were because of the following reasons;  AccountAble The CU\u2019s original goal was to avoid using Accountable.  We had discussions with a lawyer to cover ourselves legally.  Generally, the outcome/direction was very positive but due to the offboarding proposal put up for our CU, we needed to reevaluate our exposure.  The TLDR is we need to get approval from our Gov\u2019t on how we are taking funds which takes time and wouldn\u2019t have a definite answer until early next year.  This leaves us open to tax liabilities.  So given the current climate in the DAO regarding offboarding, we will be using AccountAble for the foreseeable future.  This is expected to have an impact of ~30k DAI of cost over the year, current expense of 6,220 YTD.  Tax Burden from Pre CU DAIvinity Related to how funds were channelled from the DAO to pay for expenses for the two events before the CU was formed.  This has resulted in a tax bill for one of my other companies.  The impact is 7,726 DAI and has been reimbursed by CU LLC.  Governance Voting Incentive Campaign The events team has decided to create a voting incentive campaign by means of using tickets to DAIvinity events as a reward mechanism. Demand for DAIvinity tickets has been extremely high for the last few events and this trend is expected to continue. By leveraging this demand, we believe we can attract small MKR holders to engage in governance voting by offering a ticket to a DAIvinity event as a reward for this participation. The team is currently a bit behind in our planned implementation.  We are sorting out some final details with the parameters for eligibility so people don\u2019t game the system. We will update the community with the results of the campaign once we have had time to evaluate its impact.  The current contest will run until Oct. 1 so this focused on DAIvinity DevCON. Full details can be found here.  Offboarding Vote This vote has now closed and offboarding of this CU has been rejected.  We would like to thank all who voted and showed support for our CU.  There is some good feedback we are reviewing to optimize the CU effectiveness for the DAO. On another note, we ask the community to be mindful when posting such offboarding.  The time involved for the CU and also the DAO is quite extensive to deal with such MIPs and takes time away from working productively and efficiently.  If there are concerns with a CU it is best to directly talk with the facilitator first rather than put MIPs to vote.  Our Cu is always happy to chat with anyone regarding concerns or suggestions.
