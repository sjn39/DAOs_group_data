Capital earmarked to buy Bitcoin wrapped up as a reserve (1.318B / +10B).  0a28a064-cc77-4cad-b7d6-4d09470dc61d1080\u00d7694 45.9 KB  Terra plans to buy $10 billion in Bitcoin, and that over the long term the value of that reserve will grow to back both new Ust issuances and existing Ust. Ust will now be backed by Luna and Bitcoin.  4ff5eb11-e999-420a-8597-dfc3627342801080\u00d7404 39.6 KB  The Luna Foundation Guard confirmed that they have raised $2.2 billion to invest in Bitcoin as a reserve for Ust. Terra will not sell Luna to build its reserves. Bitcoin reserves will be used to back Ust\u2019s near-term repayments and for a decentralized currency reserve. \u201cAccording to a recent conversation with Terra community members, there is approximately USD 100 million to $200 million of new demand for Ust per day.\u201d  befdb9db-29ad-477d-b6e9-7e0779a2ea2f960\u00d71280 93.5 KB  Kwon somewhat defiantly outlined that the project will continue to \u201cgrow its reserves until it becomes mathematically impossible for idiots to claim de-peg risk for Ust\u201d. The competition is starting to become fiercely competitive, Maker needs to pick up the pace of the work being done with RWA and RWF, work with greater diligence and performance than before, more aggressive growth decisions should be considered as is https://forum.makerdao.com/t/aggressive-growth-strategy/13958?u, otherwise current and future competition that is inspired by current projects and mechanisms with improvements on top of that, are going to make existence difficult for Maker. It is starting to be interesting the option of adding Ust as another collateral for Dai, because it would be like implementing in a way indirectly a combination of Bitcoin with Luna as collateral, we still have to see how it continues to develop, but it is smart to have it in our sights as the next collateral.

Core units all have mkr vesting as well but the dai salaries are already high enough that this can be perceived to be more of an added extra benefit at the expense of mkr holders rather than motivation.  If mkr simply exists for 4 years with little to no growth, members of the core units will still be doing very well.  It is good that mkr is transparent with budget and salaries but there are definitely voices out there that don\u2019t feel heard.  One weakness I find with decentralized governance is that it does not adequately consider the voice of those who have been driven away from the protocol for whatever reason and the losing perspectives slowly lose their say.

My point is that perhaps we should change the way we remunerate CU members. Instead of expensing DAI to CU members, we can consider structuring say 60% of their wage in MKR (to be released from the foundation) which will be locked and vested incrementally over a period of time. This forces CU members to be long term and long MKR - if MKR tanks, their wage tanks and they are stuck with us. TLDR; no more cash grab for CU members and only upside if MKR succeeds over long run. No price pumps and no lambo/ lavish lifestyle. ",

For example, setting up stability fee and debt ceiling used to be a big part of governance process but that has become more efficient now by allocating such responsibility to Risk team more for example. In terms of incentives and motivations, I think this is where many have been debating. I personally think the compensation and current vesting are sufficient but then there are several who point to how other protocols provide larger benefits to their members. At the end of the day, some inefficiency is needed to allow decentralization, discussion, and participation. For example, since we are talking about Terra ecosystem, CEO Do decided to provide additional funding to subsidy the rate for Anchor and then had a short poll for deciding how much. But for Maker community, if we had a similar dApp, it would still have taken quite some time as the proposal will need to be reviewed, discussed, and likely presented to the community in calls and etc to get approval. So don\u2019t think inefficiency is inherently a bad thing. But scaling the system to ensure ones that shouldn\u2019t take too much inefficiency to go through the process quickly is of course needed.

Exactly in some processes I think the analogy of the tortoise and the hare could be used. Maker in governance processes is a slow and sure tortoise, which does not care much what the market (the hare) says. But sometimes the hare is an advantage for arriving first and being the first fails, for example the integration of nfts in the protocol, the entire market (hare) would have wanted that integration. But if we had done it in record time, we would currently pay the consequences of that market that is not yet mature and that its sales fell by almost 80%. ",

We just saw Juno attempt to take funds from a wallet with governance, TFL can do that to any account at any time without needing a single additional vote. https://finder.terra.money/columbus-5/account/terra1dp0taj85ruc299rkdvzp4z5pfg6z6swaed74e6 This isn\u2019t even behind a multisig, if this wallet is compromised, then UST goes straight to 0. The reason Do Kwon is so generously giving some of his funds to LFG to buy BTC is because TFL cashes out at the same time. There is no way for him to cash out that much Luna without building a narrative, and \u201cdonating\u201d to LFG to buy BTC is just that. ",

Doo is right that hubris is a treacherous tendency (particularly in a stablecoin protocol), but Maker is hardly on the path of unquestioning hero-worship that characterised Terra. A different risk, particularly going into a bear market or broad recession, is that Maker\u2019s community loses faith in the protocol\u2019s achievements and ongoing progress. As @GFXlabs put it in their good piece today on DeFi: \u201cMakerDAO started with a simple idea: make a stable currency backed by a volatile asset. Single collateral Dai was an amazing achievement and \u2014 after extensive development \u2014 became the first tangible example of decentralized finance\u2019s potential. Since its inception, MakerDAO has evolved more than any other project and has consistently led DeFi in almost every respect: token locked value, collateral assets, assets borrowed, governance processes, organizational structure, and engineering development.\u201d There\u2019s a lot to be proud of.
