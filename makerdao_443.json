                    "content": " Unified Auctions UI Release v0.3.2 - December 10th 2021 Version: v0.3.2 Name: Sotheby\u2019s  v0.3.2 in a nutshell It feels good to write the first release notes as an official core unit. Our last sprint was under the motto: Pave the way. We made adjustments and refactored the architecture of our MVP. This paves the way for the development of further auction services. For example, notification bots or backstop keeper implementations. During the SES incubation program, we dreamt of a unified entry point for all auction related tools and services. With our new unified auctions portal, we want to establish such a go-to solution and pave the way for users to interact with auctions in one way or the other. We have also implemented additional features to our existing web app that allows participation in collateral auctions via flash lending. Mainly to provide the user with more valuable information while interacting with active auctions. This paves the way for more features and improvements to come soon\u2026 In case you wonder about the naming of our release: Just an affirmation to our dedication for auctions!  A closer look at changes and new features  Unified Auctions Portal  Unified-Auctions-Portal3104\u00d71974 498 KB  With the unified auctions\u2019 portal, we are aiming to provide a one-stop solution that redirects users to relevant resources related to auctions. This includes the different UIs to participate in either collateral, surplus or debt auction. But we also included auction-related analytics tools as well as existing keeper implementations. In doing so, we hope to streamline the auction related user journey. We also  hope to give more visibility to awesome tools that have been built by the broader community already. If you are missing your favorite tools in this list yet, please reach out via discord. We stuck to our approach to distinguish between an explanatory and expert mode. The explanatory mode provides extra information on the three different auction types. As well as a quick primer on what the other analytics tools and keeper implementations are good for. Adjustable outcome wallet  Adjustable-Outcome-Wallet1086\u00d7730 83 KB  While the default receiver address for profits from auction participation will always be the one connected to our UI. With this new feature, we allow users to specify the receiver address. The address needs to be inserted before execution of the flash lending functionality. This allows users for example to directly send funds to a cold wallet.  Architectural changes To enable re-usage of auction related functions in the backend, those parts of the code were separated into a reusable internal library. This enables us to work on notification bots, a backstop keeper implementation. It also enables to effectively share code between the client and server-side modules.  Sneak peek into an upcoming feature  Price Drop Animation  Price-Drop-Animation1434\u00d7614 45.6 KB  So far, we kind of keep the user in the dark on when the next price drop of an active auction is going to happen. With our new price drop animation, this will change. The user will have transparency on when the drop will occur and also what the next price point will look like. Still WIP but very close to being shipped. ",

Core of this release is the implementation of a twitter bot that informs about auction starts. Besides the bot implementation we further improved the UX of our collateral auction tool and did invisible improvements to our CI/CD pipeline. The french auction house Aguttes auctioned this week the first text message ever sent with the words \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d as an NFT. As SAS we obviously picked up this theme, named our release \u201cAguttes\u201d and wish the whole community a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and a happy new year.  A closer look at changes and new features  MakerDAO SAS Twitter Bot  Twitter_Bot2376\u00d7450 108 KB  The MakerDAO SAS Twitter Bot informs about each new auction getting started on mainnet and provides a seamless entry point to participate in a collateral auction via our dedicated UI. Clicking the link in the tweet will redirect the user directly to the respective auction. With the bot implementation we want to further lower the barrier for auction participation and raise awareness for Maker auctions in the broader community. We are planning to continuously increase the scope of the bot and for example tweet about auctions that are close to becoming profitable in the future. A positive synergy effect: Some technical features of the bot implementation like the server-side fetching of auctions will be leveraged for our planned keeper implementation. If you haven\u2019t done so already follow @MakerDAO_SAS on twitter and stay informed about started auctions as well as other updates from the SAS core unit.  Price Drop Animation  Price Drop Animation1384\u00d7550 31.1 KB  The price drop animation feature provides the user with information on the next price as well as when the next price drop is going to happen based on the step and cut parameters for the respective collateral type. With this feature we enhance the information base for a user\u2019s participation decision.  Devops From an infrastructure perspective we investigated and fixed an issue with our CI pipeline: Tests took forever and were partially crashing. By switching to a kubernetes (k8s) runner and adding monitoring, we were able to observe huge Memory and CPU needs and then adapted the test runners accordingly. In addition, we improved the whole CI/CD pipeline by moving more artifacts over to kubernetes - giving us insights via cool and helpful dashboards. This migration will allow us to monitor our pipelines and make it easier to find problems. Besides that we split up core and frontend testing in order to parallelise it for quicker runtimes. We also added the twitter bot test steps and the twitter bot helm artifact to deploy it. ",
