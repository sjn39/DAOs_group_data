Circulating Dai by Platform   Dai-lights We\u2019ve spent recent weeks tracking the growth of Avalanche and Fantom, but the dust has settled and AVAX came out on top. So, after a brief rundown of the latest AVAX and FTM happenings, we\u2019ll move into this week\u2019s theme: layers.   Avalanche  Avalanche just keeps rolling. While the competition stalled out, AVAX\u2019s TVL has climbed to $11 billion. The network now houses over 400 million Dai or over 4.6% of the total supply.   Fantom  Fantom\u2019s lived a monetary rollercoaster since the launch of the Geist AMM, and the swings haven\u2019t slowed. This week saw around 30 million Dai return to the network, adding up to a cool 231 million Dai or 2.71% of the total supply.   Harmony  Harmony aims to be a player in the future scalability of the Ethereum base-layer through its low-cost, sharded proof-of-stake network, though some implementations have come slower than expected.  Harmony outlook862\u00d7337 11.5 KB  That said, it\u2019s been picking up steam due in large part to the gamified DEX, DeFi Kingdoms. Despite offering only two Dai LPs, the chain\u2019s managed to lock in around 33 million Dai, or just over 0.38% of the total supply. The majority is held in the Euphoria and Viperswap protocols, though around 40.2% is still floating in wallets, apparently waiting for the right farm.   Moonriver  Polkadot, like Avalanche and Cosmos, aims to build a platform upon which any number of blockchains can be built. Currently, that number is capped at 100 parachains, so to divvy up their digital land Polkadot is holding auctions allowing users to stake their DOT in support of their preferred project. Moonriver was the first auction winner and aims to run atop the Moonbeam parachain as its \u201cpermanent canary chain\u201d, through which code is stress-tested before being shipped to Moonbeam. Here\u2019s a look at the parachain\u2019s current landscape:  838\u00d7337 9.29 KB  Though its primary use case is stress testing, its users have access to earlier launches than chains intended for battle-tested code. And degens rejoiced. A little over 17 million Dai has been bridged to the parachain or around 0.2% of the total supply.   Rollup szn A flurry of speculation surrounding Loopring saw it\u2019s price march to its ATH, but it\u2019s not the only layer-2 making headway:  At the time of writing, the Optimism network still only houses a handful of platforms, but has continued to grow to the tune of nearly 47% in the last two weeks.   Synthetix is the largest with around 29.88 million Dai locked in its protocol - good for 66.68% of the Dai bridged to Optimism.  Uniswap rounds out seconds place with over 7 million Dai held in its liquidity pools, which is around 16.32% of Dai bridged to the layer-2.  And last, but certainly not least, let\u2019s take a peek into Arbitrum. Just under 19.5 million Dai has been bridged to the layer-2 solution, representing a 9% decrease in circulating Dai over the last two weeks. But the total value locked in all tokens paints the picture very differently. Around 2.34 billion in locked value lives on the Arbitrum network, while Optimism hosts just over 345 million. All-in-all, the last 14 days saw rollup solutions grow by a net 66.04%, and they now hold a cumulative 63.22 million Dai or 0.01% of the total supply.

                    "content": " Multi-chain DAI-lights DeFi Fall\u2019s been a season full of Dai-bridging, and one bridge has finally taken a decisive lead - the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge. This past week also saw the NEAR protocol announce an $800mil liquidity incentives program, placing it in between Fantom and Avalanche as the second largest incentives program to date. The separator is that the NEAR incentives program emphasizes developer grants, while Avalanche and Fantom chose to attract a user-base through liquidity mining. So, NEAR might have it\u2019s day, but for now the people have chosen Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon as the side-chains of choice. So, our week\u2019s theme is familiar: bridge hopping for sweet, sweet gains.  Bridging Avalanche and Fantom had an entertaining scrap in the battle for alt-chain liquidity, but Avalanche finally pulled ahead this week in a decisive fashion.  The Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge holds around 325 million Dai or 96.95% of all DAI bridged to Avalanche. The Synapse bridge is also picking up steam. From experience, the slippage is a touch higher than similar protocols, but its users are given a small amount of a chain\u2019s native token upon bridiging. The bridge has only been around since late August, and currently has around 10mil Dai stored in its contract.    Avalanche Avalanche Rush saw an underwhelming launch but after upping the offering, users have returned in droves. Nearly 100% of Avalanche\u2019s on-chain activity has occurred on its C-Chain; the EVM-compliant chain.  Money Markets One thing separating Avalanche from other L1/L0 competitors is the breadth of Dapps already available. Avalanche has three established money markets:   Aave | $2.76bil TVL   Banker Joe | $1.88bil TVL   Benqi | $1.33bil TVL   Aave needs no introduction, but the others are newer names. Banker Joe launched as Trader Joe, the premier AMM on the AVAX network, but the surprise launch of a borrowing and lending program catapulted Joe into the list of top projects by TVL on the chain. Benqi is another money market and the first to launch on Avalanche. It\u2019s seen some growing pains as new entrants entice humble farmers with 4-digit APYs. That said, Benqi is more than holding it\u2019s own as all three money markets have locked in over $1bil in value. All in all, over 335 million Dai now calls Avalanche home, or 4.13% of the total supply.  Fantom The Fantom ecosystem has seen it\u2019s ups and downs, but zoom out a bit and you\u2019ll see that growth has been quite steady. The Fantom chain offers low fees, rapid finality, and is fully EVM-compliant, making it an interesting side-chain for the future scalability of Ethereum 2.0.  Money Markets   Geist | $1.26bil   SCREAM | $463mil   Fantom currently houses two money markets: the largest is Geist, a project launched with the support of the Fantom Foundation. Geist is unique in that its token is not used for governance but as a monetary incentive. Users can lock their Geist into a 3-month vesting cycle to receive a share of the platform fees. The other is SCREAM, a fork of Compound. The project has not caught on as quickly as Geist, but offers a much wider range of lending and borrow options - particularly for stablecoins. Dai can be used, lent, and borrowed on both platforms for some of the more competitive rates across any layer-1 solution.  SpookySwap Fantom also offers a litany of farming protocols, with the most popular being SpookySwap. The platform includes a number of Dai LPs, a native bridge to and from the chain via AnySwap, and a newly released NFT platform. The platform also announced a partnership with OHM or more specifically OHM Pro, to manage SpookySwap\u2019s DAO treasury. The move brings added utility to the BOO token, which can now be used to vote on changes to the protocol. Another week of slight decline now places Fantom at around 181 million Dai or 2.24% of the total supply.

Luckily AVAX isn\u2019t the only chain that\u2019s been busy, leading into our theme of the week: side-chains. Circulating Dai by Platform    Avalanche  Avalanche is establishing a comfortable control over the side-chain market, raking in another 80 million Dai last week. Pair that with a positive net inflow on each of those days, and it\u2019s tough not to talk about.  Daily Inflow/Outflow (all tokens)  816\u00d7437 16 KB  chart via Uniwhales That said, that kind of traction can come with a price. As of the time of writing, transaction fees on some protocols are greater than 10 USD. All told, the chain now accounts for over 482 million Dai or 5.35% of the total supply.   Celo Celo utilizes the Optics bridge, which was recently placed into Recovery Mode. A post on the Celo Governance Forum sparked a public dispute. The internal squabble saw over 9 million Dai leave the chain, or a 44.9% decrease in the past week. Around 10.6 million Dai are still hanging in there, or 0.12% of the total supply.   Rollups  Dai on Layer-2 Solutions  This week, the chart mostly speaks for itself. Loopring has continued to grow amidst speculation surrounding a Gamestop-led project on the network. Last week saw nearly 667k Dai move to Loopring, representing a 16.4% increase in on-chain circulating Dai. And then we have Optimism. Around 10 million Dai was bridged to the network last week, good for a 21.5% increase. The L2 now plays host to 50.2 million Dai or 0.56% of the total supply.  Notes Correction: The Klaytn figure from last week was off due to an error in a third-party listed conversion rate. The numbers have since been corrected, and week-over-week growth is now accurate.

                    "content": "Multi-chain Dai-lights - November 11, 2021 The overarching theme of the month has been bridging. As Liquidity mining programs dropped to the tune of $700bil, humble farmers hit the bridges. BSC and Polygon were sitting comfy, but with Fantom and Avalanche joining the fray they\u2019ve got new contenders - and a new king. AVAX is now leading the pack by over 100mil Dai.  Circulating Dai by Platform As of November 11, 2021    Dai-lights   Avalanche  Avalanche Rush started slow, but it\u2019s rolling now. Last week AVAX took a resounding lead in on-chain Dai, and this week was no different, as another humble herd of farmers bridged on over to AVAX.  The Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge holds nearly 380 million Dai or 97.7% of all DAI bridged to the chain.  Avalanche is EVM-compliant and features several of the same faces you\u2019d see on Ethereum, but it\u2019s the newcomers propelling the TVL. The network features four competing money markets, all with a sizable liquidity hold. We took a look at the first three last week, but this was Blizz Finance\u2019s week - and they took full advantage.  Money Markets  AVAX Money Markets849\u00d7401 24.1 KB  Banker Joe came on strong after an unannounced launch of a borrowing and lending market, but this space moves quickly. Less than two weeks later, Blizz Finance stole the spotlight. Blizz is a fork of Geist, Fantom\u2019s largest money market, which itself is a fork of Aave. What separates Geist, and now Blizz, from Aave is the incentives model. Aave rewards its users with the AAVE governance token. Blizz and Geist have no such aspirations. Instead, the platforms lean on high APY\u2019s and trading fees that trickle down to holders and stakers. In other words, they sacrifice long-term scalability to draw in users now, which speaks to how competitive the layer-1 scene\u2019s become. All in all, over 388 million Dai now calls Avalanche home or 4.4% of Dai\u2019s total supply.   Fantom  The Fantom ecosystem has seen some recent peaks and valleys, but it\u2019s still amongst the fastest growing side-chains. The network offers low fees, rapid finality, and is fully EVM-compliant, making it an interesting chain for the future scalability of Eth 2.0.  Money Markets  775\u00d7273 17 KB  Fantom currently houses two money markets: the largest is Geist, a project launched with the support of the Fantom Foundation, and SCREAM - a fork of Compound. An uptrend now places Fantom at around 202 million Dai or 2.3% of the total supply.   xDAI  The xDai chain hasn\u2019t seen much screen time recently, but Blockscout finally added an xDAI token list! I like to think it was for us. The chain now holds over 24.4mil Dai or 0.28% of the total supply. Here\u2019s xDAI\u2019s current landscape:   Notes Have anything you\u2019d like to see added to these breakdowns? Leave a message in the comments or DM me, @seth, or @JerryAG. Stay tuned for a breakdown on where to USE Dai on these chains. Thanks for reading! This is for informational purposes only. We do not endorse any of the projects referenced in this update.
