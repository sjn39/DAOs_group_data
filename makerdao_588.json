                    "content": "Hey all, given the fact that MKR has shown that it has a bit of an inversely correlated relationship with the overall crypto market during downturns (assuming there are minimal 0 bid exploits or other system failures), I thought that maybe adding it as collateral to the system might be an option as an inversely correlated asset might increase the overall health of the system. In addition to what we\u2019ve already observed, further incentives could be put into the system to increase MKR\u2019s inversely correlated relationship with the price direction of the markets such as setting rules which create more periodic burns (above and beyond the normal liquidation-related burns) during overall crypto market downtrends, thereby increasing buy pressure for MKR during these times and reducing the likelihood that MKR vaults themselves will be liquidated. This would create kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy for MKR as an asset. Overall, bringing in inversely correlated collateral in general to the system could help the system move away from its dependence on corporate stablecoins and perhaps the MKR token itself is one asset that could fit the bill for this. Maybe there is a flaw in my thinking here, but just wondering what others thought of this idea. ",

The difference between MKR and other examples is that there is an actual increased demand for MKR during overall crypto market downtrends (due to liquidation buy and burns). This is one of the fundamental characteristics of the MKRDAO system. CDO tranches full of mixed mortages on the other hand did NOT see increased demand when the overall real estate market tanked. Rather they saw decreased demand due to the weakening quality of the underlying assets that they held. The MKR system explicitly profits from other assets in its own ecosystem weakening. Can you show how one of your examples saw the demand for its own asset increase during the downturn of the ecosystem that it existed in? If this idea were considered, rules could be devised such that the height of the MKR asset debt ceiling was kept undersized with respect to the total liquidation of potential liquidation penalites and/or system surplus size.

So no matter what we decide to do, this risk is still present. One important difference is that MakerDAO would not allow any other entity to borrow said collateral to use in a governance attack against the protocol. A solid argument why this could be fruitful is you could allow said collateral to be used for governance while at the same time allowing some of the capital of that collateral to be used by the owner, lessening the disincentives to contribute to governance.

Regular market theory would indicate that if we offer a competing possibility that is somewhat attractive we should get portions of the market share. As Maker vaults do not allow the collateral to be borrowed by a third party it would reduce the available supply of MKR possible to borrow, making a governance attack more costly as you would have to buy the MKR over borrowing it. So in short. Yes I agree. ",

The same risk that we have currently with all of our current stable collateral as well as wrapped BTC, corr?   No, they\u2019re quite different and this isn\u2019t to do with regulatory or custodial risks. Emergency Shutdown exists in case there\u2019s a malicious takeover of Maker Governance. By shutting down the protocol, we ensure that DAI holders (and vault owners) do not get screwed. They still have the ability to exchange DAI for all the collateral that we hold. If you had MKR vaults and Emergency Shutdown was triggered, DAI holders would get partially reimbursed in MKR which would have zero value because the protocol has been shut down. So they are forced to take a haircut. You don\u2019t have this issue with any non-MKR collateral. TL;DR is that Emergency Shutdown needs to exist and will instantly kill the value of MKR when triggered. Having MKR vaults makes triggering ES equivalent to losses for every DAI holder. I do agree that it\u2019s important to have inversely correlated assets though and finding good ones that fit the bill would be very useful for the protocol. ",
