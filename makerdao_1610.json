Our story is very easy to understand and it\u2019s great to see MakerDAO\u2019 initiative. I spent 20 years on the consulting space (regulatory & risk management projects for Financial Service), Then in 2014, together with the former Head of Supervisory of Bank of Italy, I launched a couple of fintech initiatives. One of those was [email\u00a0protected] [email\u00a0protected] was different since we launched an Inventory Monetisation platform (when all the platforms were focussed on the receivables financing). Inventory Monetisation is NOT financing (basically a Corporation can sell the inventory to our platform and continue to use the goods for their operations without generating further debt). I was the first one who came in 2015 to the Regulators, leveraging our network, asking to tokenise inventories attracting the upcoming digital assets community and fiat investors. We didn\u2019t think about Covid, Ukraine, shortage of goods among supply chains \u2026 The demand for our service is now huge, across the globe. We hope MakerDAO can help the real economy through the [email\u00a0protected] Platform (basically a new RWA to fund leveraging the digital asset community). How we can work together? We would like to replicate the recent success story of SocGen, ConsolFreight, \u2026 Looking forward to progress the process! ",
