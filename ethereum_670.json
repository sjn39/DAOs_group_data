It would be great if we could have one list of all the projects and initiatives which had their beginning within Ethereum Magicians. The most interesting would be active projects and initiatives, whereas activity means one or more people working on it regularly and/or substantial budget dedicated to it. Let\u2019s create this list for our inspiration ahead of Council of Paris. Please, mention the project name, people running it and where/when it started with relevant links/info. ",
