As the later standards now derived from ERC-721 are showing, there\u2019s so much potential once we get past the naming convention. In any case, that\u2019s not necessarily my topic. I would just like to promote this ideological conflux which I\u2019ve come across; it returns us to the ecological notions of degree and sameness. Please examine these two related points: #1:   github.com/fulldecent/EIPs       Reconsider the word \"deed\"     by fulldecent   on 08:41AM - 23 Feb 18 UTC   4 commits   changed 1 files   with 148 additions   and 160 deletions.       and #2: https://erc725.originprotocol.com/#/identity/0x64453cE1CB78A5F3d918d0BA162FE084bD2b5405 The ERC-725 alliance seem to have adopted the Origin protocol, which contains self-sovereignty within a marketplace, via a \u201cmarket protocol\u201d or an interface (at least). I\u2019m pretty sure Plato would consider this some plain dealing in Chattel. @alexvandesande i like when things come full circle. in fact, if nobody else objects, then I suppose that I can freely code with this model myself \u2013 as it has been done outright already. This is interesting to me, as I\u2019d previously pitched such an idea to Biometrids earlier on (ERC-721 style) and, by way of the concept of UBI, to Makerdao as well \u2013 not directly, but through my inferred audience, of which you have now become a part. Thanks for your consideration. Peace, out. ",

Not to drag out the hypothesis that was interjected into the ERC-721 naming debate but to reiterate: to categorise (solely recognise) something new (unexplored) by its literal anti-thesis (e.g. \u201cnon-fungible\u201d) quit simply takes away from the possibly endless creative repercussions of really getting to the heart of the matter, i.e. using a proper name (as an explicit statement of utility) instead of a trite neologism or nickname. Don\u2019t get me wrong: nicknames are all well and good, as long as they refer to a real name \u2013 not to some ad-hoc nomenclature. To coin a neologism and morph that into its own nickname post hoc: this is an affront to language. As has already been noted elsewhere, much of the ERC token standardisation topics share common cross-purposes; the lines of difference and the far-reaching collisions of meaning overlap all over Github. Therefore, I would like to offer the following formal social signal: #tokenship cheers @alexvandesande @Jackdurose for the lead-in. be well, y\u2019all. ",

With this in mind, I\u2019d like to put forward the Sebeok/Bateson concept of information \u2013 more specifically, meta-information (inference even). I don\u2019t mean to throw up the existence of a neological under-current, however: there is a definite semiotic function in the nomination of such things. It entails culturally dynamic aspects of tokenship and token usership. Furthermore, I see an implied deontic matrix surrounding the body construction argument, as I predicated originally on the question of \u201cdeed\u201d.
