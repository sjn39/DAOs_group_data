I am by no means an expert on SNT so please correct me if I am wrong about anything. My concerns are mostly centered around the present lack of technical audits for the soon-to-be-launched V1. The existing technical audits are not so helpful as they date from mid 2017. But I do note that audits are ongoing for the V1 codebase. Based on this I would kindly propose that a review of SNT as potential CDP material is postponed until  V1 audits are passed V1 launch some time is allowed to pass after V1 launch for a slightly more realistic market value and some user base  A bit of the problem with SNT is that it is very much influenced by network effects. In other words it is likely to be a bit of an all or nothing type project. In the Maker community I have a tendency to be a bit gung ho about adding collateral but this is too much even for me. If the community decided to include SNT at this stage the debt ceiling could have to be crawl space for this to pass. My position is that we take a more thorough review of SNT sometime Q2 2020, with the upside that the debt ceiling could potentially be much higher if the project turns out to have real value. ",

There have been other audits done more recently on sub-protocols such as Usernames which was completed and deployed a year ago. You can also find more audit related information from the Status home page under security. I would post them but new forum user I\u2019m limited to the amount of links I can add to this post. @ginworkflow I\u2019ll attempt to make the case for why SNT makes a good candidate for MCD below. For starters I suggest reading the original whitepaper. It lays out the broad vision for why such a network should exist, the types of users it appeals to and how they will interact with it. In short it describes a social network that departs from the incumbents that are operated by an owner, and instead proposes a network owned and governed by the users that preserves user privacy and is censorship resistant. In order to achieve this artifacts of traditional social networks are built as protocols. For example usernames are no longer issued by an authority but rather a contract that will mint an unclaimed username in exchange for locking up some SNT, making the user the owner of the username asset. The lock up is there to disincentivize and prevent bad behaviors such as name hoarding but also creates a value accrual mechanism to help sustain the network overtime. In the case of Usernames, it has already been deployed and has use while Status is in beta. You can track the usage of Usernames and the other use cases as they come online at:  analytics.status.im  Status also has a page that describes some of the use cases and crypto-economics here: https://status.im/snt-utility/ These use cases are different in their appeal and usage from DeFi networks and as a result the value accruals to SNT should overtime have a low correlation with the value accruals of other networks. Having a basket of low correlated assets is an established method of reducing the total volatility of a portfolio and adding SNT to the collateral pool should bring the diversification benefit that reduces the total risk of the collateral pool. Finally I created a series of interactive notebooks to model the economic value of some of the use cases. You can change the assumptions in the combined notebook or individually to see how it might impact the value. You can find a link to it from the SNT utility page. Again, sorry for not posting all the links, I don\u2019t have permission to post more than two. ",
