Many have asked me why I am in support of the Endgame, and I laid out several reasons. In this short post, I want to share how the Endgame actually protects Delegates better than the current system as some seem to worry about delegates\u2019 role in the future once it passess. This is not about the pay but more about structural protections in the end. 1.The current Delegates are prone to attacks and pressure -Nobody likes their proposals and especially budget requests or new onboardings challenged. And as one of the delegates that often ask questions and are critical of such, I personally also get a lot of attacks and pressured to change my vote or be silent. And this is due to the nature of the asymmetry of decision. For delegates, voting action itself, beside researching about the proposal, takes 1-3 minutes to vote onchain. Meanwhile, the proposal can mean even millions in reward for the affected party. So it is indeed in such parties\u2019 incentive to pressure delegates to vote in support of them. While not bending to such pressure has also cost me many bridges burned better or worse, the new structure effectively prevents such. In such cases, I can ask Arbitration scope to deal with such, and there will be no taboo of sharing to CVC either as that is part of the path the Endgame community wants to move toward. In addition, the voting decisions are about following CVC\u2019s voting strategy. Therefore, even if they challenge each delegates, ideally, delegates should be less prone to such lobbying. 2.The current Delegates have to make choices that they are not experts of -This is especially applicable to RWA related proposals. Although some delegates are more knowledgeable about RWAs than other delegates, delegates themselves are generally not expert about RWA or very technical details related to Smart contract. Therefore, instead of pressured to make decisions with limited time and knowledge for such large decisions. The Endgame helps to relieve such, allowing DAO as a whole to make more informed decisions. Of course, each delegates\u2019 experience and opinions vary, but wanted to share these as a delegate to share some challenges and how Endgame can help to solve such. ",

They highlight two main issues with the current system: delegates are prone to attacks and pressure, and they have to make decisions they are not experts in. The Endgame proposal addresses these issues by providing structural protections and allowing the DAO as a whole to make more informed decisions. The post also addresses some common concerns about the proposal.",

MIP113: The Arbitration Scope Framework     5.4.4: CDs must respect their role as guardians of the security of the Maker Protocol and act accordingly, by not taking actions that could be perceived to put the security of Maker Governance into jeopardy through politicization of the CD role.     5.4.6: CDs may not be found to collaborate to influence Maker Governance in groups or structures outside of the CVCs.

There is still much to improve in the constitution and all the scopes. But overall the intention that delegates should not be political and instead should be more like a type of security role or constitutional judge, that support CVCs in making their decisions, and, in edge cases, prevent them from doing stuff that could be potentially dangerous. So marginal decision making should never be made by delegates, their discretionary powers to ignore CVC decisions will mostly only be used in rare situations. It will be very helpful to get input on how we phrase these things in the constitution so that the intention and the useful aspects are covered, while not creating second order problems or unworkable edge cases.
