                    "content": " MIP10c9-SP31: Subproposal to Whitelist Oracle Access to Oasis.app on rETHUSD Oracle  Preamble MIP10c9-SP#: 31 Author(s): Chris Bradbury Contributors: Chris Bradbury Type: Process Component Tags: oracles Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: 2022-10-03 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Specification  Introduction Oasis.app, a third-party application for accessing the Maker Protocol and wider DeFi ecosystem, would like access to rETHUSD Maker Protocol Oracle in order to support the full suite of Oasis.app features on the launch of rETH as collateral in the Maker Protocol, including it\u2019s stop-loss automation feature helping protect users from liquidation. We are aware that the rETHUSD Oracle is not yet deployed, but the hope is to have this sub-proposal approved so that the whitelist approval can be included into the same exec vote as the rETH collateral onboarding (currently scheduled for 19/10 based on the collateral status index). This sup-proposal is directly related to the previously approved MIP10c9-SP30 which is still currently active and used, and this proposal uses the same address as this currently approved one.  Oracle Names  RETH/USD   Customer(s) Oasis.app - [email\u00a0protected]  Whitelist Oasis.app - 0x55Dc2Be8020bCa72E58e665dC931E03B749ea5E0 - OSM   Requirements For each customer address to be whitelisted: - Is the contract source code verified on Etherscan? yes - Is the Oracle data used in a permissioned manner that would prevent parasitic behavior? yes - Is Oracle data written to storage? no - If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? n/a - If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? n/a  Fee In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees are waived for the first year and determined by MKR Governance after that.
