Hot Topics:  As we look back on a year of rapid onboarding, and get ready for the upcoming budget season, Kyle asks \u201cWhat should the DAO budget be?\u2018\u2019 As a starting point, \u201cIt is common to have roughly 60% of a tech startup\u2019s costs borne from development.\u201d With the recent passage of GPC\u2019s ~$1MM quarterly budget and about half of Moonshot Collective (another $200k) conceivably combining to form our development costs, that leaves $800k. Kyle suggests keeping 250k seperately carved out for Grants Ops to protect the DAO\u2019s ability to run quarterly rounds. Kyle and Lindsey visualize one potential option for the DAO budget, by workstream, below:   1600\u00d71175 175 KB    Owocki asks \u201cWhat can we learn from BrightID\u2019s Aura Sybil Defense Software?\u201d In this system, high-trust users are marked by BrightID founders or other high-trust users as a trusted seed, given some \u2018energy\u2019, and are able to traverse the social graph. They can mark others as honest or sybil and are rewarded with more \u2018energy\u2019 if they correctly identify sybil attackers.   Johnx25bd urges the Gitcoin community to move forward with the Carbon Neutral Policy Proposal and identify \u201dwhich carbon tokens we want to retire to offset historical emissions.\u201d He poses a few possible ways to make this decision including through subcommittee, twitter poll, or quadratic voting.   Simona shares an updated Budget Proposal Process for Gitcoin DAO that outlines a five-week process: each proposal would have two initial weeks on the forum as a draft for feedback, an additional week on the forum after integrating feedback, a week on Snapshot to vote, and a week on Tally to ratify. If a proposal does not pass then it can be resubmitted using a template which requires highlighting the essential Intents the workstream is aligned with.   Nate provides an update on how the GPC team is responding to Lefteris\u2019 proposal to remove lifetime funding received from gitcoin grants page. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to update the grant page to say \u201cEstimated lifetime funding received\u201d, to display the amount rounded to the nearest thousand, and to include a \u201cthis number should not be used for accounting purposes\u201d statement.\u201d   Owocki shares his updated Q3 steward delegations and emphasizes a few criteria which might dominate his thinking for Q4 including: Grants 2.0, Passport, empowering stewards who can get people out of the wrong roles, and decentralizing leadership towards up and coming leaders.   In a thread on flexible voting, Ben from ScopeLift shares details about the Open Zeppelin Governor Contract: \u201cBecause it\u2019s written in a modular manner, it allows for the developers deploying the DAO contracts to customize it by extending or writing extensions. This means if you want, you can definitely modify the OZ Governor to break that Bravo Compatibility to differing degrees, depending on how you choose to customize it.\u201d     Gitcoin Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream S15 funding request ratification [Tally]    Proposal Discussions:  Schelling Point Event Workstream Setup Proposal Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak  Carbon Neutral Policy at Gitcoin    Latest Completed Proposals:   Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15  Result: Passed      Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    We\u2019re working on reporting for Season 14 and preparing our budget for Season 15!   With GR15, PGF will focus on setting up the grants program for a transition into a protocol world. We will be more intentional about what sub-rounds we fundraise for and what constitutes a \u201cminimum viable round\u201d for side rounds. We will also decouple the main and side rounds, taking a step toward a permissionless protocol and improving our scalability processes, based on some of the challenges (e.g., tagging) in GR14.     Moonshot Collective    Passport Identity Staking: This week, we iterated on our staking contract, wrote goals based on our essential intents, and created a new passport stamp that verifies if you gave GTC staked. We also have a demo of what it\u2019s like to stake GTC on the goerli testnet and get that verified as a stamp.   Operations and Strategy: We gathered feedback on our S15 budget request, are getting closer to finalizing it, and will be posting on the forum next week.     Fraud Detection & Defense    FDD kicked off last week with a deep discussion on budget, roles, and outcome ownership for season 15. The core focus remains achieving a high ROI in our execution of fraud & defense detection across the grants round. We also aim to provide useful data insights to the Moonshot and Gitcoin Product Collectives to close the gap between Sybil detection and Passport identity.   Joe, Omni and Carl gave a presentation on how on-chain data (your NFTs, POAPs, Snapshot voting records, Lens profile, etc) can be integrated into Sybil detection and Passport stamps, and ultimately towards a protocol for decentralizing DeSoc data analysis. It also includes some fun data visualizations showing the grant preferences of different communities.    1346\u00d7704 86 KB      Merch, Memes & Marketing    We\u2019re getting ready for GR15 by clearly defining roles and responsibilities so we can build a strategy and timeline for execution. Our designers are hard at work creating original assets for the round. We\u2019re very focused on working closely with the PGF team and coordinating our efforts.   We\u2019re working on updating our brand identity and preparing for this to be an ongoing conversation that benefits with input from all sides. Emerging themes include \u201charmony\u201d and \u201cnetworked.\u201d   Our Grants 2.0 product marketing effort is really ramping up! We are synthesizing a lot of research into audience personas to help us position our messaging. We\u2019re also considering how we tell stories around our protocols and beginning content creation.     DAO Operations    Cross Stream DAO Ops (CSDO):  We put a switch to six month budget proposals on hold and are continuing with three month budgets. After season 15, we will reassess the budget term. We also discussed the best way to have conversations about budgeting, following Kyle\u2019s recent forum post, and whether a post like that should have been brought to CSDO before going on the forum. Instead of moving the post into a google doc, CSDO requested Kyle remove \u2018Proposal\u2019 from the title and we continue the conversation async. We talked about using WorkDAO to simplify the contributor experience regarding compliance, benefit availability, retirement accounts, etc. There is a 12% fee for each contributor and open questions about whether to use it and where the budget would be drawn from.      Gitcoin Product Collective    Grants Hub: We worked on a proof of concept that will allow us to encrypt and decrypt PII data (Personally Identifiable Information) in order to share with Round Manager. We also determined the requirements and userflow for verifying a project\u2019s Twitter and Github information. Now we\u2019re moving toward being dev-complete with Phase 2 of the project, and deploying to production.   Round Manager: We built a userflow for approving and rejecting grant applications. We also started using a new CI (Continuous Improvement) tool called Slither on the team. Now, we\u2019re moving toward deploying on Optimism.   Passport: We\u2019ve integrated LinkedIn and Discord as new stamps and identified a list of additional stamps for our backlog. We\u2019re also paying out hackathon prizes and refactoring passport.gitcoin.co to an SDK.     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on Discord!
