Make your voice heard  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  Please provide your feedback on the workstream budget proposals. Discussion has been extended to May 10th with Snapshot proposals going live on May 11th. GitcoinDAO\u2019s anniversary is right around the corner! We\u2019re requesting your input on what to include in our year-in-review! If you\u2019ve been a workstream contributor we would also appreciate if you could fill out this quick survey     Hot Topics:   The GitcoinDAO Governance Process V3 is the source of truth for details on how the DAO is governed. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of contributors, delegates, and stewards. It describes the processes used to move proposals through different stages so they can be agreed on and executed. This includes how new and existing workstreams can be funded. The process also includes details about the role of the CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) as a coordination layer among workstreams to discuss, review, and ratify DAO-wide initiatives.   Joe shares a Data Analysis for Season 14 Budget Proposals which compares season 14 to 13 in terms of each workstream\u2019s budget and requested amount. The data analysis highlights that PGF, MMM, and DAO Ops workstreams are asking for more funding than season 13 while FDD, MC, and dCompass are asking for less.   Owocki shares a S14 Voter Guide Template to encourage intersubjective consensus through stewards clearly articulating what they are voting for and why.   Vivek amends the S14 KERNEL Budget Request by lowering the funding request from $900k to $576k USD (a 36% reduction). This change is following specific feedback from @ceresstationand Linda.   The Season 14 Budget Request for dCompass by Huxwell features questions from QZ about how the funds from last quarter can carry over to cover most of the requested budget. The workstream only needs an additional 3.5k GTC to meet its S14 budget request.   The budget request for decentralizing Gitcoin Kudos has questions from Simona and Joe about the background of the proposed team and the need for soulbound NFTs. @ceresstation agrees with Joe about wanting to know how this fits into Gitcoin\u2019s product roadmap for Grants 2.0.   The overton window for Grants 2.0   by Owocki discusses how there is a window of time for Grants 2.0 to come into existence and that window is closing. We have a lot of (friendly) competition for market share that has more velocity than us yet we have way more resources than our competition.   Owocki requests proposals for ImpactDAO Category Creation and Impact Certificates. Creating ImpactDAO as a category means amplifying understanding of what an ImpactDAO is and helping ImpactDAOs be successful. Impact Certificates create legitimacy around who has created impact for social good and \u201ccould get really powerful if we were able to create buy pressure for Impact Certificates\u201d   Owocki shares his Practical Pluralism Essay Draft and requests feedback. Pluralism is the understanding that diversity within a given context generally results in better outcomes. For the Ethereum ecosystem to be antifragile, we need technological diversity of clients, RPC nodes, funding mechanisms and cultural diversity of people, communities, opinions.   8 Ideas for DAO Work @ Maximum Coordination \u2122 by Owocki explores how we can improve workstream budgeting, structure, and coordination. Three of the eight featured ideas (thinner workstreams, subDAOs, Orca pods) focus on creating smaller groups to allocate funding to. Another three of the eight (conviction voting, Coordinape, higher fidelity voting) focus on creating more granular governance processes for how to determine where funds should flow.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals      PGF - Season 14 budget request For $1.19mm USD / 198k GTC      DAO Operations S14 Budget Request For $989k USD / 179k GTC      MMM - Season 14 budget request  For $841k USD / 152.9k GTC      KERNEL: A GTC Workstream Proposal  For $576k USD / 96k GTC      Moonshot Collective Season 14 Budget Request For $564k USD / 103k GTC      FDD Season 14 Budget Request For $486k USD / 89k GTC      Decentralize Gitcoin Kudos For $200k USD / 33.4k GTC      dCompass - Season 14 budget request For $114k USD / 19k GTC     GR14 Round Structure & Future of the Main Round        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding   In our season 14 budget request, Linda and Simona ask for details around why the budget amount for the Public Library is as high as $90k USD for one season. QZ explains this is the same amount as last season and the library is also the primary source for onboarding new contributors. Kyle suggests a 45% budget reduction from 160k GTC to 88.75k GTC @ceresstation responds that it\u2019s bad principle to restrict the budget because it went unspent, the DAO workstream is gaining employees from holdings, the safe could be updated, and they are already taking the bear market into mind.    Moonshot Collective    In the collective\u2019s season 14 budget request, Kyle shares his sentiment that the budget should be reduced by 19.2% from 103.7K GTC to 83.8K. QEDK points out that Moonshot\u2019s mission is to be more than a prototyping workstream, it is to further public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole (such as by having contributors who are involved with regen projects like the Citizen House and Token Collective). Joe recommends focusing on finding solutions for problems faced by other workstreams at GitcoinDAO.   Do not miss this very special episode of the Green Pill Podcast hosted by Kevin Owocki! In this episode, Kevin is joined by Phoebe Tikkel (aka Solarpunk Girl) who is the founder of Moral Imaginations, an organization using collective imagination tooling to make a more harmonious world.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    FDD\u2019s season 14 budget request includes comments where several community members express their gratitude and excitement for FDD while looking forward to greater inter-squad cohesion. QZ asks for additional focus on Grants Policy communication, removal of FDD storytelling, and more inter-WS discussions. Joe responds that much of this highlights the need for increased communication, which storytellers can do. Kyle suggests a 43% budget reduction from 118K GTC to 67K and says \u201cGitcoin seems to be paying for the education and advancement of a number of ideas - Sybil DAO, Most of \u2018Evolution\u2019, Catalyst, etc. without any discernible increase in value being delivered back to the DAO.\u201d Joe points out FDD\u2019s role in solving problems which existentially affect Gitcoin\u2019s future, that quadratic funding does not work without sybil resistance, and FDD\u2019s focus on creating a decentralized protocol.   Mandates delivery report (open for feedback) by kishoraditya explores how to create metrics for processes within DAOs. These metrics focus on evaluating FDD core teams and/or functions such as Grants Investigation Agency, Sybil, and Project Management. The metrics were drafted through creating feedback loops with relevant SMEs to ensure high trust in the system.   The Rewards Modeling squad\u2019s OKR Report provides a solution for the community to not only own the Grants 2.0 infrastructure but also the structures which allow communities to meaningfully access it. According to Disruption Joe, we should \u201cnot only build the resource allocation infrastructure of the future with Grants 2.0, but ensure there are onramps for all voices to be heard.\u201d This system would allow for anyone to participate in moderating for grant eligibility, sybil users, and any other subjective decisions the community needs to make. If we don\u2019t want content moderation to be censored by a large company or single point of failure, we need to decentralize the inputs to the system.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    The MMM season 14 budget proposal has questions from Simona regarding if PR/Comms from YAP Global are needed. Kyle shares his sentiment that MMM should reduce budget by 21% from 167.7K to 132.5K GTC in order to cut out \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d. Joe supports the current budget but points out a lack of clear, measurable metrics. Sean updates the budget proposal to reduce the funding request by 9% from $923k to $841k USD by eliminating virtual events funding and decreasing the funding request for Content, Brand, and Ops substreams.   Memepalooza 8 is happening this Friday from 6 to 8 PM UTC. We\u2019ll be memeing on all things web3 & public goods in our discord with our friends from Prime DAO and CultDAO. You won\u2019t wanna miss this!     DAO Operations    Kyle proposes a 4% budget reduction from 115K to 110K GTC in our season 14 budget. Joe asks for outcome definitions which focus on connection to problems faced by DAO Ops customers (other workstreams) and more clearly defined success metrics. Jodi responds with a proposal to remove specific-to-accounting reserves and reduce professional development budget by 50% to lower the overall workstream budget by 5.4k GTC. She goes on to discuss how the workstream arrived at our OKRs, how we prioritize work, and how we attach accountability to people.   On our weekly CSDO call we decided to extend the time workstreams have before their budgets go to Snapshot, create an extra steward council call for budget discussion, and test a new Gitcoin Conflict Resolution Policy within the DAO Ops workstream.   In Treasury Diversification Working Group Updates, Kyle discusses the potential for a bear market and Gitcoin\u2019s role as the light that fuels the ecosystem. Because of that, Gitcoin needs to \u201creally focus on the core thesis that we are a protocol DAO with great impact (funding for public goods).\u201d The post takes the stance that Gitcoin budgets have grown faster than protocol development and we should consider new ways for us to continue to fund ourselves.   We are hiring! We are still looking for a qualified Support Lead. We also just put up a new role for someone to join us as a Community Management Lead!     Upcoming community events    Come make memes with us and our frens from Prime DAO and CultDAO! Memepalooza 8 is happening this Friday from 6 to 8 PM UTC in our discord!

If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!  The GPC workstream is led by Lindsey Thrift and Kevin Olsen. \u201cWe have been working in close collaboration with the DAO while residing in Gitcoin Holdings and are eager to fully integrate our work and operations. We will be bringing with us the foundational development of the Grants and Passport protocols and have ambitious goals to drive early adoption and validation of the designs in Season 15.\u201d says Lindsey. GPC\u2019s entry into GitcoinDAO comes shortly after CSDO ratified the DAO\u2019s purpose and essential intents, which include building Grants and Passport protocols.  Graphic by Octaviaan   Key actions for this week:   Sign the on-chain ratification of Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream S15 funding request    Help us improve the GitcoinDAO Digest by interacting with this pol.is! Add your own statements and vote on what others have put forward. Remember to check back regularly to vote on new statements. Thank you!      Hot Topics:   Kyle announces that the Gitcoin Foundation has finalized asset transfers from Gitcoin Holdings which means \u201cwe can start to formalize the relationship between the DAO contributors and the newly created operating company within the foundation.\u201d   There is a heated discussion around removing lifetime funding received from the gitcoin grants page. Thomas Rush comments that the number is super useful when deciding whether or not to donate to a grant and does not create a tax liability. Nate Gosselin, of GPC, says \u201cthere are still community members who find this indicator valuable \u2014 given that, we\u2019re not comfortable removing this feature.\u201d Lefteris, who initiated the proposal, claims \u201cThe data is inaccurate by order of magnitude as both my team and I have showcased\u201d and insists the current situation is unacceptable.   Chase provides insight into Moonshot Collective\u2019s evolving role in the DAO as the GPC enters to build the Grants 2.0 protocol: \u201cMC\u2019s priority is to help GPC make these protocols more accessible by being the first community to build on top of them.\u201d   The Green Pill Podcast with Kevin Owocki has had three banger new episodes drop:   Episode #27 is a deep dive into the governance and evolution of GitcoinDAO with four leading stewards: Linda Xie , Kyle Weiss, Kris Decoodt, and Simona Pop.   Episode #28 with Balaji Srinivasan discusses Balaji\u2019s new book on the Network State and how we can coordinate collective action.   Episode #29 with Austin Griffith talks about how the best way for builders to get started in the space is to Speed Run Ethereum, and the journey Austin\u2019s had through Web3 as an educator and builder.       GitcoinDAO Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream S15 funding request ratification [Tally]    Proposal Discussions:  Schelling Point Event Workstream Setup Proposal Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak  Carbon Neutral Policy at Gitcoin    Latest Completed Proposals:   Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15  Result: Passed        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Looking back on Season 14, we\u2019re proud to say:  We had 57% new partners as matching funders! Our cause round matching funds increased by 30% compared to Season 13 Our ecosystem round matching funds increased by 52% compared to Season 13 We closed our first mutual grant with Radicle!    The pgDAO (public goods DAO) is starting to come to fruition with our partners from other organizations.   We\u2019ve operationalized Hubspot as a CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) to help us manage, track, and grow our relationships with funders.     Moonshot Collective    Passport Identity Staking: We\u2019re moving quick and have built an initial smart contract and interface that allows users to stake and unstake. We\u2019re deployed on testnet and getting ready to iterate on a lean MVP.   Operations and Strategy: We\u2019re partnering with GPC to identify what builds would be the most impactful for season 15 and the upcoming Grants 2.0. With those priorities in mind, we also started drafting our S15 budget proposal.     Fraud Detection & Defense    This week we built a new API for data scientists to easily interact with Gitcoin Passport data using any language - specifically Python & R for our use cases.   We shared a starter tutorial for querying on-chain data relevant to DeSoc analysis.   Season 15 budget planning is underway. On Monday we will have a 3 hour session with core contributors to collectively build out our priorities and OKRs with the feedback from CSDO.   We started a \u201cContributor DNA\u201d analysis, which takes contributor donation data and provides a unique fingerprint that can be used for Sybil detection, DeSoc scoring, and more!     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We kicked off an effort to evolve our brand! We\u2019re keeping the work coming from GPC/Grants 2.0 in mind and ensuring all our designs across the DAO have a cohesive look and feel. For GR15, we\u2019re thinking about how we can incorporate more regenerative or networked themes.   We officially launched on Hubspot and sent our first email from our new platform!   We have completed an overhaul of the Steward Health Cards with improved automated data pipeline, and rebuilt our back-end architecture for faster future updates.We\u2019re excited to soon be releasing a set of new features, starting with the introduction of Workstream-cards.     DAO Operations    Cross Stream DAO Ops (CSDO): This week, we passed a proposal by Saf for DAO Ops to own our weekly DAO Vibes call, build a lively community experience, and create a structure of calls we can repeat each month. We also discussed our travel policy for reimbursing contributors as something that each workstream must own for itself rather than DAO Ops. Lastly, we discussed our compensation policy and how to balance managing the global nature of DAOs with location-based salaries. While compensation decisions currently vary by workstream, GPC is standardizing around US-based salaries and MMM uses a tiered approach based on experience.    Gitcoin Product Collective    Grants Hub: We completed phase 1 of product developmen and are moving into the next phaset! We\u2019re targeting to be dev-complete with phase 2 by August 1st. Right now, we\u2019re updating our designs based on partner feedback, conducting user research sessions, and evaluating the technical feasibility of verifying credentials with Round Manager.   Round Manager: We\u2019re aiming to have our MVP live in production on the Optimism chain by August 1st. In order to make sure our database of grants program is always available, public, and decentralized we\u2019re finalizing the development of our Subgraph. This will also give us the ability to retrieve data much quicker than we would otherwise.     Upcoming community events   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.    New to GitcoinDAO?    TLDR - What is Gitcoin?

If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  Vote on Snapshot to ratify foundation and governance process updates and begin a Gitcoin // Radicle public goods alliance.  Donate to your favorite grant before the round ends! Psst hey, did you know that all grant disputes and appeals are public and that you can flag any suspicious grant while you\u2019re looking for the best public goods to fund? Here\u2019s how you do it     Hot Topics:   Owocki announces he is Passing the Torch as Gitcoin Holdings transfers assets to Gitcoin Foundation and disaffiliates from the DAO. There have been over 119 threads authored by Owocki on the governance forum to help share his context. Now, he hopes this departure will help the DAO focus on \u201ccreating a culture where its members always seek to decentralize power, and avoid entrenching leadership.\u201d In parting, Owocki shares: \u201cGitcoin has been my baby for almost 5 years now, many ups & downs, and it is very bittersweet to see it growing up and \u2018leaving the house.\u2019\u201d   Bear Market Vibes from Kyle calls out that the DAO\u2019s impact matters and there is a need to ensure \u201cwe have the capital on hand to weather a global economic downturn.\u201d With Season 15 around the corner (~ 6 weeks), the DAO needs to reduce our costs, diversify our treasury, and explore new strategies. These could include \u201cincreasing depth of liquidity, increase volume of trades, increasing utility of GTC and exploring some passive yield generation opportunities.\u201d   Shreyas shares a Gitcoin Treasury Diversification Update proposing \u201cmoving $15 million of GTC (~4.6m GTC at time of writing) to a multisig wallet.\u201d If approved, $3M of this amount would be swapped into USDC by an agency desk while strategic partners are confirmed for swapping the remaining $12M.   GTC will be entered into the upcoming C.o.R.E 4 by Tokemak, shares Schlabach from Llamas. Collateralization of Reactors Event (C.o.R.E) is a competition to win a token reactor that would \u201cgenerate deep, sustainable liquidity for DeFi and future tokenized applications.\u201d   DisruptionJoe shares that Airdrop Farming is \u201cthe act of donating with the intention of getting an airdrop, not for the intention of signaling support for that public good in a QF round.\u201d Individuals who have made multiple accounts to airdrop farm are engaging in Sybil behavior and will be squelched to prevent the accounts from affecting matching fund distribution.   There is a lively discussion happening around compensation commitment within the DAO. The conversation focuses on whether the DAO should be paying high US salary rates, the current market, and the importance of salary transparency.   Listen to the latest episodes from Kevin Owocki\u2019s Green Pill podcast!   Episode #18 is a conversation on Collective Organization with Pia Mancini, co-founder of Democracy Earth and Open Collective, drilling into how DAOs can learn to govern more effectively, \u201cexit to community\u201d, and create new institutions for the internet generation.  Episode #19 is a panel about Grants Round 14 and the modular future of Gitcoin Grants featuring: Scott Moore, cofounder and PGF workstream lead; Annika Lewis, PGF workstream lead; Kevin Olsen, VP of Engineering; Lindsey Thrift, VP of Product; and Austin Griffith, GitcoinDAO steward.

In the midst of a hungry bear market, our contributors have shown up. GR14 has raised over $500k in the same amount of time as GR13 raised $200k. Regens unite!   We\u2019re making sure we close out GR14 strong in the next few days and keep things running smoothly. In the meantime, we\u2019ve already started fundraising for GR15 by forging community partnerships for raising matching funds.   Come find out more about public goods at our live events next week!   June 21st 7PM UTC: Public Goods are Good Twitter Space with DreamDAO and ImpactDAO.  June 22nd 3 PM UTC: Public Library call in our Discord! We\u2019ll be featuring Matt Prewitt, president of RadicalxChange. Reach out to Madison Adams if you\u2019d like to join!

Moonshot Collective    Gitcoin Passport: In collaboration with the Grants 2.0 workstream, we\u2019ve been super busy responding to the feedback we\u2019ve been getting from launching our alpha product in GR14! We\u2019re making upgrades to our Ceramic infrastructure to support the heavy network traffic.   Governance Operations Scaling: We\u2019ve drafted an initial, prioritized problem statement and proposed solutions. Now, we\u2019re making sure this is in alignment with the perspectives of our DAO stewards.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Community Intelligence: Our data scientists and analysts are working to find an optimal trust bonus weighting, looking into other Grants 2.0 protocol-based scoring models, and following up on our Airdrop Farming commitment.   Grants Intelligence Agency: We review thousands of grants each season to ensure the community\u2019s intentions are served. Here\u2019s a look at the process we use to review grants for eligibility before handing them off to the Grants Operations team to review the tags.   Data Operations: Our Sybil Account Detection (SAD) model has been running every 12-24 hours throughout GR14 to improve the user experience. At this point in the round, we begin to add data from the Sybil hunters to adjust to new information.   Operating System: Our workflow now includes two important meetings: Mondays at 5 pm is our weekly update which is open to anyone who wants to know what is happening in FDD. On Thursdays, our outcome owners (core) and trusted contributors participate in a process & decision-making meeting. The rest of the week is async with multiple work-in-public sessions. Check out our great Work Async Improvement Checklist by Tigress     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We\u2019ve been spreading the word about GR14 and our efforts are paying off! We\u2019re so excited for what our network of regens can accomplish together. This week\u2019s accomplishments include:  Having our second biggest day on Twitter EVER! (First was launching our token!) Seeing our website traffic increase by around 50% compared to GR13!    We\u2019re kicking off an effort to develop a primer for the upcoming Grants 2.0 to help with awareness and education around how Gitcoin is set out to decentralize and level up our Grants protocol   June 23rd at 7 pm UTC: Join us live in our discord for Fundapalooza! We\u2019ll be closing out GR14 with a fundraiser and celebration!      DAO Operations    CSDO: We\u2019re upgrading our CSDO calls to enable more work and deeper discussion to happen async. On this week\u2019s call, we discussed ratifying updates to our DAO purpose and essential intents, the need to educate our community about Sybil airdrop farming, and guidance on paying contributors in the bear market.   GR14 is keeping our user support team busy and we are closing out tickets as fast as we can. Most tickets are requesting help with the new Gitcoin passport, missing contributions, and log-in errors.     Grants 2.0    Gitcoin Passport: On the first day of GR14 we received over 1000 passport sign-ups! On the second day of GR14, our ceramic infrastructure felt the weight of that traffic. In collaboration with the Moonshot Collective, we are stabilizing our infrastructure to support the heavy user inflow and ensure uptime.   Grants Hub: We\u2019re excited to announce we are 100% dev-complete with our MVP! In the next couple of weeks, we\u2019ll be getting production-ready to meet our July 1st deadline.

Key actions for this week:  Celebrate one year of GitcoinDAO with us on this tweet thread! Provide your feedback on GitcoinDAO\u2019s Draft Purpose & Essential Intents     Hot Topics:   Jodi shares that CSDO seeks Community Input on GitcoinDAO\u2019s Draft Purpose & Essential Intents after \u201cseveral members of CSDO raised concerns that there was growing misalignment [\u2026] around the DAO\u2019s mission and methods.\u201d On May 6th, workstream leads and Gitcoin Holdings leadership met to have a strategy session, and develop a preliminary sense of the DAO\u2019s purpose and essential intents. The attendees then elected a subgroup to continue the effort and that group\u2019s draft is shared in this document. They state that the purpose of GitcoinDAO should be \u201cto empower communities to build and fund their shared needs\u201d and request community feedback on this as well as the four essential intents by Friday, June 3rd.   Philip proposes Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts from Governor Alpha to Open Zeppelin\u2019s implementation of Governor Bravo, reducing the delay on our timelock, and continuing to evaluate how to solve other governance pain points. The proposed upgrades would reduce the delay in turning around budget requests, and allow us to configure proposal parameters to remove or reduce restrictions. These restrictions include requiring 1MM votes to create a proposal, a user only being able to create one active proposal at a time, and having a minimum proposal vote threshold of 2.5MM votes.   In The Grants 2.0 Flywheel, Owocki begins by articulating that Grants is a three-sided marketplace among Grant Owners, Community/Ecosystem Builders, and Contributors. A virtuous cycle between these three market participants is described where any of them increasing will also cause the others to increase. Grants 2.0 will build on this by open-sourcing modular tools which enable increases in mechanisms, grants registry integrations, and governance utility to feed this virtuous cycle.   Schlabach and HelloShreyas from Llama share a proposal to Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak. Tokemak is a \u201cnovel protocol designed to generate deep, sustainable liquidity for DeFi.\u201d The benefits of using Tokemak could include increasing GTC liquidity across DEXs and earning revenue for the DAO. In order to do so, Gitcoin would need to win a Tokemak reactor in ~1.5 months by getting enough votes. Votes can be earned through advocacy, bribes, and/or a mutual grant.   Owocki shares an essay he wrote titled \u201cWhere is the fire around this fire?\u201d about how, at a small music festival, he noticed that some of the campfires had people around them having fun and enjoying each other\u2019s company, while other people just had the fire burning. In a time of transition, and a bear market, Owocki says \u201cI hope we keep the fire around the fire. And if we can\u2019t do that, I hope we can keep the fire burning. Because it\u2019s not just the GitcoinDAO fire that we are keeping alive. It\u2019s the mission. It\u2019s the impact\u2026And if we can\u2019t do that, I hope that some of the fire from GitcoinDAO is carried forward in each of you in whatever you do next.\u201d   In The Meta Trap, Owocki quotes \u201cIf you think a typical cause has very high impact, it seems quite plausible that you can have even higher impact by working one level of \u201cmeta\u201d up \u2013 working not on that cause directly, but instead working on getting more people to work on that cause. [The Meta Trap].\u201d He goes on to identify two particular meta traps that Gitcoin should watch out for as \u201cProbability of not having an impact\u201d & \u201cOverestimating impact\u201d and advises the DAO to consider these in their daily work. Owocki proposes that less meta work should be funded during times of scarcity and budgets may want to take this into consideration.   The latest episode of the Green Pill Podcast is live! This week Owocki speaks with Auryn Macmillan about Practical Pluralism and the essay they wrote together on this topic. Auryn is founder of clr.fund, a solidity dev, and a Gnosis Product Manager.

It shares some context about the four pieces of Grants 2.0:  dPopp, Grants Hub, Grants Explorer, and Round Manager. While the first two of these have been in development, Round Manager has just been kicked off in earnest in the last two weeks. We\u2019re excited to run 3 alpha rounds on the Round Manager MVP by November.    dPopp: We are 87% complete with our MVP goals for dPopp and on course to complete our MVP for GR14. We are working on GR14 branding for our alpha launch which enables Gitcoin members to test our product. We also have a new demo!   Grants Hub: We expect to finish testing our Grants Hub MVP by June 3rd and just released our new demo. We expect to be production ready by July 1st so we can prompt users to migrate to the new Grants Hub during GR14 claims.     Public Goods Funding    GR14 starts on June 8, which is just two weeks away! We have over $1.5M in matching funds confirmed! We are heads-down getting everything ready for this round including grants eligibility briefs and finalizing partnerships.   Our round structure governance post received a lot of comments and engagement. The proposal is now live on Snapshot for voting!     Moonshot Collective    We\u2019re thrilled to announce the brand new name for dPopp (decentralized proof of personhood passport) to\u2026 drumroll, Gitcoin Passport!   We finished the final iterations for key workflows for the Optimism Citizen House. We\u2019ve delivered initial workflows for a retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) grant explorer.   We\u2019re scoping how we scale governance operations and drafting user journeys for our stewards. We\u2019ve synthesized our discovery research to prioritize pain points stewards face and are prioritizing solutions to prototype. Expect a governance post soon!   We\u2019re focused on making the Moonshot Collective the place to be for builders in the DAO community. We\u2019re merging our community and Discord with the Builder Band (Gitcoin hackathon alumni) to form a talent pool that can learn, teach, grow, and build together!     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Our updated season 14 budget request is live for feedback on the forum. We present 4 options for stewards to choose from in determining how much to fund us and for which outcomes. These options range from the bare minimum needed for round execution ($200k) to the amount needed for improvement ($330k), and discovery around a sybil detection DAO ($390k). The most expensive of these options is still a 40% budget reduction from our initial proposal.   We\u2019ve added the levenshtein distance to our Anti-Sybil Operational Process (ASOP) and containerized the process to work with one click. \u201cThe Levenshtein distance between string a and string b is the minimum number of edits required to transform a into b.\u201d We can use this metric to identify low-effort sybil accounts by their username.   We completed our full backlog of grants applications since GR13 and began work with LexDAO to improve our appeal process and close liability gaps.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We\u2019ve finalized the assets for our GR14 marketing campaign and are ready to drive some hype around funding public goods! GR14 starts super soon: June 8th to 23rd!   Sean shares his thoughts on Gitcoin\u2019s Purpose and Essential Intents \u201cOur vision, purpose, mission & impact feed into our overall marketing strategy. They are what is used to create a channel & content strategy\u2026 We will use this clarity to speak with a unified voice to all of our audiences, thereby increasing awareness, comprehension & action.\u201d   We kicked-off a building-in-public channel and used it to develop our Season 14 content strategy in public. We\u2019re making sure we align on our mission and breaking our audience into segments for targeted campaigns.   We\u2019re celebrating one year of GitcoinDAO!

Check them out, and let us know if you have ideas for improvement:  GitcoinDAO: Governance & Financial overview GitcoinDAO: Governor Alpha & Timelock GitcoinDAO: GTC      DAO Operations    We passed two proposals this week in our CSDO:  A proposal to consolidate the Moonshot Collective and the Builderband while aiding in increasing participation at events and hackathons. A proposal to create and migrate governance forum topics into more fitting categories, add a new visual layout to the forum, and create tags.    We\u2019ve learned a lot from our season 14 governance process and are interested in shipping a version 2 to match our DAO\u2019s evolution.   We are hiring!

A huge, quadratic thanks to the amazing community who made Schelling Point possible: our speakers, volunteers, sponsors, and attendees!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!  We\u2019re back with another edition filled with the latest from GitcoinDAO, let\u2019s dive in!  Key actions for this week:  Check out the polis survey by DAO Ops to help us improve the governance forum Don\u2019t miss the Schelling Point recordings from Amsterdam Keep an eye out on the forum for upcoming Workstream budgets      Hot Topics:   Schelling Point Amsterdam was hosted on April 21st at the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky. We loved seeing you there, making memories together, and planning our solarpunk future. Check out the agenda with information about the recorded talks, workshops, and unconference sessions.   Scott announced the start of Constructing a Mutual Grants Committee to formalize the process behind mutual grant agreements. Stewards and members of the Public Goods Funding Workstream are invited to join the working group. Owocki raised a question about if the committee will also consider agreements between the DAO and Workstreams which may spin-out to go independent.   Fred shared a new dashboard from the MMM Workstream that deep dives into the GitcoinDAO Governor Alpha setup filled with some interesting metrics and information.   Puncar gives an update on the Gitcoin Forum Improvement Project, coalescing a vision for the forum as \u201can organized, easy-to-navigate active community space where people post their well-thought ideas to get feedback and build a consensus that lasts over time\u201d. This would include using high-level categories and role-tagging (e.g community, Stewards, etc.) to minimize complexity and maximize the reader\u2019s ability to find relevant threads.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     GR14 Round Structure & Future of the Main Round   Partnership and Mutual Grant with Wonder Result: Not Passed   dCompass Release Plan and Beyond        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    We are actively working on a framework for mutual grants (token swaps) to help ensure we are acting as effective metagovernance stewards.   Annika shares some preliminary details for GR14 Round Structure & Future of the Main Round to get community input. With Grants 2.0 coming soon to enable anyone to spin up their own QF round, the Public Goods Funding Workstream recommends not changing the main round and instead spinning up a Gitcoin-led Ethereum infrastructure round. The Workstream also recommends Stewards to ratify Gitcoin-led rounds, and plans on more clearly defining platform eligibility criteria.     Moonshot Collective    Green Pill Podcast Episodes 9 and 10 hosted by Kevin Owocki are live! Episode 9 features Greogry Landau, founder of the Regen Network \u2013 a Cosmos-based public goods project \u2013 and co-author of a 2011 seminal piece on 8 forms of capital. Episode 10 features Trent Van Epps, founder and steward of the Protocol Guild, in a fascinating discussion about funding for core protocol devs and designing networked systems.   Moonshot Collective builds prototypes of decentralized tools for DAOs. Are you interested in demoing Tip Party (reward participation) or Pay Party (vote on contributions) for your DAO, Workstream, or Team? Send us a DM on Twitter!     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    We are working on our Season 14 budget proposal and planning to go live next week. While doing so, we are also setting goals for ourselves 12-18 months in advance. The Workstream is especially focused on minimizing the effect of sybil attacks on Gitcoin Grants, improving the quality of data inputs and processes, and empowering contributors to help FDD sustainably deliver on outcomes.   We want to re-review the entire set of active grants in preparation for Grants 2.0, run three simulations to optimize our review system, and lower the cost per review by at least 50%.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Schelling Point Amsterdam was a big success and the work behind it was truly a team effort. MMM took part in planning, logistics, and running the event under the guidance of the amazing @pop & @gloria. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this magical event!   MMM Stewards are focusing on the budget and structure of the Workstream for the upcoming Season 14 budget request. As part of this, we are exploring a new substream structure and contributor types.   We have several exciting new developments in the works to improve our operational process and increase the amount of content we\u2019re creating. This includes a grantee showcase, website migration, and marketing automation platform.     DAO Operations    We are hiring! We need a Hiring Manager, and Support Lead.   We had a great strategy discussion in our leadership retreat and have drafted our S14 OKRs.   We are looking into proposing a process for increasing budget uniformity across Workstreams   We are comparing how Workstreams pay their contributors and creating documentation for payment tooling.     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET on Discord!

Attend the upcoming Twitter space featuring Kimbal Musk and Kevin Owocki all about quadratic funding this Sunday, May 15th @ 8 ET!    Hot Topics:   Season 14 Voter Guides are here! Check out these great resources where stewards go into detail and explain their thoughts and reasonings:  Kyle Kris Annika QZ  Bob Lefteris Griff    GitcoinDAO\u2019s Leon Erichsen, author of How Soulbound Tokens Can Make Gitcoin Grants More Pluralistic, contributed to Decentralized Society: Finding Web3\u2019s Soul by Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin.   With a backdrop of season 14 budget discussions, Owocki asks \u201cWhat would a Lean/Effective Gitcoin look like? \u201d This post provides four examples of stewards with \u201ca complaint about a lack of leanness and a lack of effectiveness.\u201d Owocki also shares his view that \u201c[the] DAO spends millions of dollars in tokens on things that just don\u2019t have ROI\u201d and that \u201cby pulling at these weeds we can have our execution meet our moment.\u201d   Does paying DAO contributors in GTC lower the price of GTC from those contributors cashing out? Fred and Ivanmolto have conducted a data analysis on \u201cthe correlation between GTC outflow from GitcoinDAO and GTC spot price.\u201d The analysis found that \u201ccontributors of GitcoinDAO are likely to hold their GTC and the average amount of GTC held by this group is increasing.\u201d There appears to be no correlation between GTC outflow and GTC price, however \u201cGTC is [\u2026] correlated to similar tokens in the sector.\u201d   In Hiring Freeze?, Kevin Owocki gives notice that he is proposing a Hiring Freeze to Holdings Leadership due to concerns about a bear market and a lack of DAO effectiveness. On the topic of GitcoinDAO, Owocki says \u201cI am just one node in the GitcoinDAO network. The DAO has no CEO. It is up to workstream leads & DAO leadership whether it wants to tighten its belts.\u201d   Roadmap to GTC Utility  by Owocki synthesizes the latest thinking on the possible utility of Gitcoin\u2019s governance token. Beyond being used to ratify proposals, GTC could also be a protocol governance token (\u201cby creating a widely used protocol\u201d) or a metagovernance token (\u201c[by] doing Mutual Governance Rights Grants\u201d).   Owocki shares a demo and prototype for a GTC Conviction Voting dApp built by Virax, 0xDarni, and AustinGriffith of the Buidl Guidl. This dApp could increase the utility of GTC by enabling users to adjust the sort algorithm of Grants through staking GTC. Grants which have more GTC staked on them could be shown earlier to funders. This dApp was built in just 3 days!   Keikumata provides more information about the MintKudos team background and amends the proposal to scale back the requested funding amount and season 14 scope. The new scope would involve focusing on product discovery and designs while incrementally building trust with Gitcoin. Annika says that while the MintKudos team\u2019s work is \u201csuper high-potential and exciting,\u201d she doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to be a workstream because of \u201cthe existing US-based entity & venture funding raised.\u201d     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals      FDD Season 14 Budget Request for $486k USD  Public Goods Funding WS Budget Request for S14 for $1.1MM USD      DAO Ops S14 Budget Request for $948k USD      MMM - Season 14 budget request for $841k USD      Moonshot Collective S14 budget request for $450k USD      KERNEL S14 Budget Request for $216k USD      dCompass - Season 14 budget request for $110k USD      MintKudos Workstream S14 Budget Request for $40k USD       Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Kimbal Musk will be hosting a twitter space about quadratic funding with Owocki this Sunday, May 15th @ 8 ET - tune in!   We are reducing our budget request for the \u2018publication\u2019 and \u2018impactDAO cartography\u2019 categories by 50% each for an overall 6.3% reduction in our budget from 198K GTC to 185.5K GTC (at $6/GTC). We believe this is consistent with other workstreams tightening their belts and focusing on core initiatives.   We have launched shortened URLs for GR14 to improve the user experience and shareability of Gitcoin Grants!     Moonshot Collective    As a reorganized collective, we have reduced our budget request for Season 14 by more than 20% from $564k to $460k. In order to reduce our budget, we have decided not to roll out a minimum base pay for \u2018Trusted\u2019 contributors or hire additional designers. We are also focusing on building for Grants 2.0 and GTC Utility, while stepping away from IOJ. We are committed to the priorities of the DAO and assembling a team to fully dive in on available opportunities.   We have a working product for 3 of 5 key workflows for our Optimism Partnership and successfully demoed this earlier this week! Optimism is identifying citizens to mint soulbound citizenship NFTs as we gear up for RPGF 2.   Episode 13 of the Green Pill Podcast hosted by Kevin Owocki is live! Special guest ManuAlzuru, founder of DoinGud, visits to share where his optimism comes from and talk about how NFTs can be used to empower creators to do good.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    We are working on a revised budget while reviewing community and steward feedback. We are aiming to post amendments, with input from Gitcoin leadership, on Friday, May 13th. This will be followed by 5 days on the forum for discussion on the new budget and then a snapshot vote. We are aiming to reduce our budget request by 20% while also better communicating our alignment with the Grants 2.0 vision.   We believe core to some of the disagreement about our budget stems from how we are preparing for Grants 2.0. At FDD, we believe Gitcoin should be building the tooling that allows others to run their own grants rounds. We believe there are two types of tooling that this will require: sybil defense and grants eligibility moderation. Sybil defense tools (such as dPOPP and ASOP) are already being built. We also want to build tools that allow communities to reach consensus on what grants should or should not be eligible in their rounds. If we do not build this, those communities may delegate to a single person (creating a centralized system), fail to adequately moderate, or be stalled on running a round until they build their own tooling.   Sirlupinwatson shares two posts about learning sybil resistance. A Sybil attack is defined as \u201ca scenario in which an attacker poses as many users as possible in order to infiltrate a system and succeed in secretly abusing it.\u201d Sybil attacks can be prevented by having strong user authentication, creating a network that encourages neutral interactions, and punishing those who violate network rules.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We revised our initial budget proposal to reduce the funding request by 9% from $923k to $841k. We are focused on really trying to strike a balance in achieving all of the ambitious things that the DAO wants us to do, and doing the things that really matter.   We are interviewing candidates for leading the content substream and working on our marketing campaign for GR14!     DAO Operations    We reduced the amount we\u2019re requesting from the treasury for season 14 by 4.2% from $989k to $948k USD. \u201c[We] anticipate that the initiatives and commitments we make in S14 will set up our team and the DAO for long-term success. We cannot predict the future, but we have big dreams for GitcoinDAO and in collaboration with our fellow workstreams, will continue to scale existing initiatives to meet the needs of the DAO. \u201c   Based on feedback from DAO stewards and CSDO, we are exploring how we can improve the budget proposal and deliberation process for Season 15. This will involve better guidelines, financial anchors, and evaluation standards.   We are hiring! We are still looking for a qualified Support Lead. We also just put up a new role for someone to join us as a Community Management Lead!     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.

Hot Topics:   Get ready for Grants Round 14 with this thread: \u201c We\u2019re kicking off #ReFiSummer with over $3M in matching funds including $1M in the main round\u2026 AND over $2M across a record-breaking 13 ecosystem rounds & 3 cause rounds\u201d   Nate shares details about the hard work of Prepping cGrants for its Final Voyage. The team has optimized the most popular checkout experience in terms of chain, wallet, and token options \u201cto handle the largest potential swath of traffic during a grants round.\u201d New features include support for Coinbase Wallet and short URLs for each round within GR14. A number of fixes have also been applied to our search, ops workflow, and site copywriting. These updates will allow the team to focus on building the next version of the platform: Grants 2.0.   Disruption Joe presents a model for Gitcoin sustainability which takes a long-term view on Gitcoin as a solution to a resource-allocation problem. Joe believes GitcoinDAO can achieve sustainability through essential intents which focus on clearly and measurably launching a successful Grants 2.0 protocol and increasing the value of governance. \u201cGTCs sole utility should be investing in workstreams, structured and unstructured, via Gitcoin governance. \u201c In order to do this, \u201cGitcoin should use quadratic weighted staking to reward people for governance participation\u201d and let staked GTC \u201cbe used to participate in the governance of the components of the Grants 2.0 protocol.\u201d   In Roadmap to GTC Utility, Nate informs us that members of the DAO met to \u201cbrainstorm ways to increase the utility of GTC.\u201d The reasons to do this include \u201cproviding legitimacy /longevity /viability for the DAO.\u201d The team explored ideas such as staking GTC in Gitcoin Passport, a Grants curation game, a Tokemak reactor, mutual grants, and liquidity pooling. The team will stand up a committee to keep working on this and present options to the CSDO.   Puncar shares details about the new structure of Gitcoin\u2019s forum and how to use it. The forum now has new categories and includes tags which \u201c are used to inform the right people that they should read and/or comment on some new post.\u201d You can now for example tag a post with \u2018stewards\u2019 to make sure your target audience can find it.   Bob walks us through how to ask a question on Gitcoin. He suggests doing your own research before asking by using the MEE6 discord bot for FAQ, checking the support knowledge base, searching the Discord and Google. If you can\u2019t find the answer, then seek support in the Gitcoin Discord server.   In a thread about how and why growing, idealistic movements increasingly conflict with one another, Vitalik says one thing we can do about this \u201cis to focus more on the newer and smaller sub-movements, that are more opinionated about their values. The \u201cregen finance\u201d movement in ethereum (big credit to @gitcoin, @proofofhumanity and now @optimismPBC, arguably @MolochDAO too) is one great example.\u201d   You do not want to miss the latest episode of the Green Pill podcast! In this episode, Kevin Owocki brings on Gitcoin\u2019s Leon Erichsen to guest host a discussion with Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlaver. They discuss the ideas in the DeSoc Paper authored by Puja, Glen, and Vitalik which Leon contributed to.

We implemented updates to our discord and governance forum which changed the organizational structure and should streamline the user experience.   We\u2019re working a retrospective on the season 14 governance process and looking to how we can improve for season 15. We\u2019re interested in experimenting with workstream assignment to allow stewards to gain deeper, rather than broader, context.     Grants 2.0    Gitcoin Passport: We\u2019re 93% of the way to our MVP! We recently added the POAP identity stamp and functionally integrated with the trust bonus score.

If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!  Key actions for this week:  Earn a POAP for helping FDD to test new software for reviewing grant applications. Can you solve the puzzle in the GitcoinDAO Year-in-Review and claim the 200 GTC + $100 Merch reward? Hint: ASCII and ye\u2019 shall receive!      Hot Topics:   We\u2019ve posted our Grants Round 14: Round Results & Recap! GR14 was a record-breaking round -with over 44,000 contributors who donated $1.7M to support 1,250 grants! These contributions also determined how to distribute the $3.2M matching pool using a quadratic funding algorithm. $4.9M in funding is going to fund public goods across our main round, 3 cause rounds, and 14 ecosystems rounds.   Janine wrote a proposal to ratify the results of grants round 14 and formally request the community multisig holders to payout matching allocations. The community can vote to either ratify the results or request further deliberation. The payout date for GR14 is currently set to July 15th.   Lindsey Thrift proposes a new DAO workstream, the \u2018Gitcoin Product Collective\u2019 (GPC) and budget to spin out of Gitcoin Holdings. The GPC has been working to build the core of the Grants 2.0 protocol, including the alpha launch of Gitcoin Passport. Now, they have their eyes set on building out the remainder of Grants Hub, Round Manager, and Passport. The GPC currently has 13 full-time contributors, plans on growing to 16, retaining consultants until then, and working closely with DAO workstreams such as MMM & Moonshot Collective. The GPC is requesting $1.44M from the DAO treasury. $984k of this sum is for a season 15 budget while the remaining $462k is for 60 day reserves.   Kyle Jensen provides the CSDO Monthly Decisions Summary, and will as of now be compiling a monthly summary of the decisions made in the CSDO operational calls to improve transparency into how the DAO is collectively deciding to move toward our goals.This month\u2019s summary highlights two June decisions.   The GR14 Governance Brief by DisruptionJoe and FDD reports a significant rise in sybil attacks from ~14.1% in GR13 to ~22.1% in GR14. A large portion of the increase is attributed to Airdrop Farming. Despite this, access to Metabase led to \u201ca storm of new reporting and models for identifying potentially sybil behavior.\u201d Further, FDD managed to reduce the cost per review by 39%, introduce a new grant reviewer quality score, and process 42 grant appeals. All in all, the FDD workstream\u2019s efforts mitigated $879k of Fraud Tax during GR14!   Sean shared an updated vision and mission statements based on GitcoinDAO\u2019s ratified purpose and essential intents. The current draft of our mission statement is \u201cWe envision a world where pluralistic communities thrive by funding their shared needs autonomously & with legitimacy.\u201d Sean also recommends we \u201cmake our essential intents measurable so we can track our progress against them.\u201d   Kydo, a contributor at Llama provides a specification update on a public goods alliance between Gitcoin and Radicle. Llama will write a smart contract to exchange RAD and GTC between DAO treasuries and assign a representative to be joined by two from Gitcoin to serve on a metagovernance committee. There will be a parallel committee, with the same structure, from Radicle. Llama will request $20k in GTC for their service.   Owocki shares an update in his thinking, based on conferring with Lindsey Thrift, that before Gitcoin Passport can support implementing DeSoc, it first \u201cneeds to be successful at creating sybil resistance on Gitcoin.\u201d   Last weekend, we co-hosted Funding the Commons with our friends at Protocol Labs! It was a gathering of regens and home to a special Schelling Point Unconference Pop Up. Catch up on the action over at Protocol Labs\u2019 YouTube, watch Priorities for Public Goods Builders in 2022 with Juan Benet, and check out some of our favorite sessions featuring Gitcoiners:  Interoperable Grants 2.0 Public Goods - the long and short of it Decentralized Societies Encoding our values into economic systems with Alejandra Borda Building a Regen Alliance      GitcoinDAO Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Ratify the results of Grants Round 14 and formally request the community multisig holders to payout matching allocations     GPC S15 Proposal     Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts     Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak      Carbon Neutral Policy at Gitcoin     Gitcoin Treasury Diversification Update        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    While we\u2019re still celebrating raising $5M for public goods with GR14, we\u2019re also keeping our heads down to finish our post-round tasks, including:  Communicating with partners, individual donors, and grantees Finalizing grants with FDD Confirming results    We\u2019re conducting a retrospective on GR14 to identify what went well and what can be improved before next round!   GR15 will be here before you know it and we\u2019re already drafting commitments with our matching partners including Aave, Filecoin, Zora, Loot, Aragon, and Alchemy!     Moonshot Collective    Gitcoin Passport: We kicked off a new initiative to do discovery and prototyping of identity staking! We\u2019re excited to see how we can make Web3 identity more secure and trusted than ever.   Governance Operations Scaling: Our research into Tally and Snapshot has been completed. With that, we wrapped up our wireframes for key user flows and voting on budget proposals with multiple options. We\u2019re working on a frontend prototype for the latter.   Operations: We\u2019re moving toward our scheduled contributor payment date of July 5th and making sure we have everything in place to execute. Additionally, the Moonshotcollective.space domain is now under our direct control and we\u2019re working on updating the site.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Grants Intelligence Agency: Our squad went hard for GR14 by successfully reviewing over one thousand grants with an average of 2.7 reviews for each grant! We also solved and sent results for all outstanding appeals and disputes. Finally, the Ethelo instance we stood up for dispute resolution has almost 400 people who signed up to help us review.   Data Operations: We successfully finished running our prediction model for GR14 and completed five rounds of human evaluation. Collecting data on flagged users is no small task and we\u2019re happy to have gathered that data to prepare our reporting.   Operating System: Our workstream came together to pass a proposal to create additional clarity across the workstream in season 15 by streamlining much of our documentation into a single file.   Community Intelligence: Data-driven intelligence is at the core of what we do. For GR14, we\u2019ve finished our search for the best weights across 27 billion choices to share. We also expanded our sybil hunting efforts beyond contribution analysis into the twitterverse by checking the number of twitter followers for suspected sybils.    Get a sense of how information flows through FDD by following the arrows in this animation.   Merch, Memes & Marketing    Our latest published blog post is about one of the original Gitcoin Grants: Ethers.JS. This open-source project has raised close to $300k on Gitcoin and was originally something Richard Moore built for himself to use when hacking on Ethereum. Now, it\u2019s an industry standard relied upon by projects like Optimism, Metamask, and ENS.   We published a blog post about our partnership with NounsDAO. NounsDAO releases one 32x32 pixel art character each day, with an average price of 92 ETH. In December 2021, we entered a partnership to fund public goods with NounsDAO contributing 169 ETH and a collection of five custom NFTs!   Our Steward Health Cards are undergoing upgrades that will introduce a web3-log in and give ownership of the cards over to each steward. We\u2019re also experimenting with the introduction of workstream-cards, with data from our Dune Dashboards.     DAO Operations    CSDO: We\u2019re rethinking our budget structure and are officially delaying budgets by one month, with the exception of the new workstream spinning up for the Gitcoin Product Collective (GPC) who are transitioning from Holdings.   We\u2019ve completed a DAO-wide spend report for Season 14 showing:  $67.8M in our treasury $2.9M spent on S14 budgets 5.8 years to burn on our current course and speed      Grants 2.0    Grants Hub: We\u2019re gearing up for our MVP by making enhancements to our contracts, setting up a pinning process, ensuring our product is mobile-friendly, and supporting image upload. We\u2019re also iterating on our application flow based on user research interviews and mapping our phase two user stories.   Round Manager: Our round manager can be thought of as three distinct sub-products. This week we focused on the latter two:  Round Manager dApp: the front-end that makes it easy for a community to operate a grants program without technical expertise Contract ecosystem: the constellation of on-chain contracts that record core information and provide key operational functions Program registry: the decentralized database that stores all relevant information about rounds on our Grants 2.0 protocol      Upcoming community events   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.    New to GitcoinDAO?    TLDR - What is Gitcoin?

Owocki announced further steps to decentralize Gitcoin Holdings work within GitcoinDAO and the renaming of Holdings to \u2018web3event.co.\u2019 One of the biggest parts of this will be moving the Gitcoin Product Collective who are building Grants 2.0 into the DAO as a workstream.   Elliot from Llamas shares a June Financial Report showing contributor rewards are up 76% from last month and attributes it to timing differences among workstreams. In addition, \u201cTotal Gitcoin treasury balance has decreased slightly from May, as a result of GTC token price depreciation.\u201d     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  $3 Million Treasury Diversification  Ratify the results of Grants Round 14 and formally request the community multisig holders to payout matching allocations    Proposal Discussions:  Gitcoin Product Collective S15 Workstream/Budget Proposal Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak  Carbon Neutral Policy at Gitcoin      Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    We conducted our GR14 retro (Miro Board, Notes) and identified key areas we want to improve for GR15. To help us scale, grant owners and reviewers should be provided clearer eligibility critera. Internally, we want better deadlines for each step of the round process: partner engagement, grantee onboarding, and crowdfunding.   The hype for GR15 is already building! We\u2019re locking down commitments with our partners, including drumroll please Aragon and Loot!   We rolled out new tooling for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in Hubspot and are developing fresh documentation.     Moonshot Collective    Governance Operations Scaling: Check out our demo for a prototype of what a new governance platform could look like that enables richer, deeper information flows. In this prototype, we\u2019re showing how enabling voting on multiple options and discourse integration could rocket us forward into a world of greater choice and discussion.   Operations: We\u2019re protecting ourselves against volatile market conditions by diversifying our treasury into stablecoins. Over 25% of our treasury is now held in DAI.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    GR14 Governance Brief:   Sybil Detection: We saw a significant increase in Sybil Attacks this round, likely due to airdrop farming, from ~14.1% in GR13 to ~22.1% in GR14. After flagging 16,073 possible Sybils, we narrowed this down to 9,916 likely Sybils and squelched their ability to direct matching funds thereby saving an estimated $879k in Fraud Tax.  Grants Eligibility: We completed approximately 3,000 reviews of 1,100 grants while reducing our average review cost by 39%. While doing this, we also implemented a new process whereby we review our reviewers to ensure their work is as precise, accurate, and high-quality as possible. From the outset, we announced that high-scoring reviewers could earn a bonus. The results of this process saved an estimated $80,000 in matching funds and cost the DAO $10,260.  Policy Recommendations: We believe there a number of areas which could benefit from clearer definitions. For example, while we are against outright airdrop farming, we have thus far allowed POAPs, and documenting a clear policy on Quid Pro Quo could make grant reviews easier in future rounds. We should also consider decoupling eligibility in the main grants round from eligibility in side rounds, to prevent any further situations where a side round owner request a grant be admitted that was not eligible for the main round.      Merch, Memes & Marketing    We completed our Gitcoin Technical SEO Audit to identify how we can improve our sitemap to show up stronger on Google. Our next steps will be to remove the \u2018issues\u2019 subfolder from our sitemap and clean up the identified dead links.   We\u2019ve been developing an internal knowledgebase to streamline our operations and onboarding. We\u2019re aiming for a soft launch of our new Notion area by the end of the week.     DAO Operations    CSDO: At this week\u2019s CSDO, we\u2019re keeping our eye on Season 15 (starts August 1st) and setting an intention to plan for it. We\u2019re also adjusting to the finalization of Asset Transfers from Gitcoin Holdings to the Gitcoin Foundation. With that, we\u2019re preparing contracts for contributors to sign to provide them legal protection and ensure the DAO holds on to any and all of it\u2019s IP.   DAO Tooling: We\u2019re sharing a list of currently used tools within GitcoinDAO, and performing a review of tool-owners and tool-cost.     Grants 2.0    Grants Hub: We\u2019re focused on engineering and finalizing our path to production for Phase 1 (MVP). At the same time, we\u2019re working on high-fidelity mock-ups and mobile designs for Phase 2 (Anchor).   Round Manager: We created the ability to deploy a round with an application, as well as building out core UI components. Now you can deploy an application with all questions required, but the next iterations will focus on making questions optional and providing the ability to remove questions.     Upcoming community events   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.

These will set the direction and priorities for the next quarter of active development (May 1st to July 30th). We hope you\u2019re ready for another edition filled with the latest from GitcoinDAO, let\u2019s dive in!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  Leave your feedback on the workstream budget proposals below! Take the polis survey by DAO Ops to help us improve the categories on the governance forum. Don\u2019t miss the Schelling Point recordings from Amsterdam.    Hot Topics:   KERNEL: A GTC Workstream Proposal by Vivek seeks 150k GTC in funding as part of a larger ecosystem request for $5mm in funding to transition KERNEL out of Gitcoin Holdings to an independent foundation. KERNEL is a web3 educational institution and trusted space where talented individuals can holistically explore their humanity. In this proposal, the KERNEL team outlines their immediate next two blocks (block 6 for project development and block 7 for new fellows) and an intention to build an endowment that lets them play an infinite game.   dCompass - Season 14 budget request by Huxwell features the dCompass workstream\u2019s final request for recurrent funding in the amount of 19k GTC, 2x less than previous budget requests. If approved, this would support the workstream\u2019s goal to deploy a beta on polygon, migrate Gitcoin quests, and onboard new projects.   Decentralize Gitcoin Kudos by keikumata requests 33.4k GTC to perform product discovery, iterate on designs, and deliver an MVP which builds on the functioning beta. The mintkudos platform enables community recognition through soulbound (non-transferable) tokens. The team envisions these tokens serving as on-chain contribution data that build reputation and integrate into Gitcoin kudos.   Layer Two (L2) Blockchains are an important part of scaling Ethereum so that it becomes more affordable for more people to transact. Starting May 2nd, Gitcoin is hosting the L2 Rollathon: a virtual hackathon which will focus on scaling solutions. What are you waiting for? Get rolling!   Optimism is an Ethereum L2 that just announced its native token. Have you checked if you are eligible for the Optimism Airdrop for Gitcoin Grants Funders?     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals      PGF - Season 14 budget request For $1.19mm USD / 198k GTC      DAO Operations S14 Budget Request For $989k USD / 179k GTC      MMM - Season 14 budget request For $924k USD / 167.7k GTC      KERNEL: A GTC Workstream Proposal  For $900k USD / 150k GTC      Moonshot Collective Season 14 Budget Request For $564k USD / 103k GTC      FDD Season 14 Budget Request For $486k USD / 89k GTC      Decentralize Gitcoin Kudos For $200k USD / 33.4k GTC      dCompass - Season 14 budget request For $114k USD / 19k GTC     GR14 Round Structure & Future of the Main Round        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding   The PGF - Season 14 budget request by Scott requests 198k GTC to support the workstream\u2019s grassroots community efforts, operations for Gitcoin grants, and management of community partnerships. Grassroots community efforts include weekly Public Library talks; Public Goods are Good Twitter spaces; community cartography, lore, and publications. Operations for Gitcoin grants include moving out of holdings into the DAO and sustainably scaling the number of grants raising more than $5k and scaling the number of side rounds. Community partnerships include increasing the average size of side rounds, formalizing a mutual grants committee and raising funds for an Ethereum infrastructure round.    Moonshot Collective    Lindsey shares the Updated Moonshot Collective Operating System which organizes the collective into concentric tiers of core, trusted, and community contributors. Core contributors will receive a salary. Trusted contributors will receive a tokenstream and initiative-based pay. Community contributors will only receive initiative-based pay. The OS also details an initiative workflow which gives teams budget and autonomy to self-organize so long as a core team member serves as an initiative lead, participates in regular check-ins, and reports progress weekly.   Moonshot Collective Season 14 Budget Request for 103k GTC by Lindsey details the collective\u2019s efforts for Season 14. This includes Lindsey Thrift taking over as workstream lead while Kevin Owocki and Austin Griffith step down, a focus on the Optimism partnership, building the Decentralized Proof of Personhood Passport, exploring the Internet of Jobs while discontinuing the Coordination Party toolkit.   Green Pill Podcast episode 11 hosted by Kevin Owocki is live! In this episode, Kevin is joined by Pet3r Pan, founder of MetaCartel, in a thought-provoking conversation about positive-sum play-to-earn games, building community, and the Infinite Garden.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Joe submitted the FDD Season 14 Budget Request for $486k USD. This request has top-level OKRs which are focused on preparing for Grants 2.0 while making the workstream sustainable and decentralized. We will accomplish this by adding 2 anti-fraud components applicable to Grants 2.0, lowering sybil evaluation & grant review cost, re-reviewing active grants, and improving contributor UX score.   GIA Rewards OKR Report by BFA explores several different models for incentivizing grants reviewers while optimizing for trust in outcomes and minimum review cost. Due to the decentralized nature of Grants 2.0, the intent is to arrive at a model which is generalizable to rounds of arbitrary size and scope. The team aims to solidify these conceptual models with quantitative studies by building simulations in Python.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Sean and the MMM stewards posted the Season 14 budget request for 168k GTC to lay the foundation for Gitcoin as a protocol, increase awareness of public goods funding, and elevate the brand experience. To do so, we will establish a workstream operating system and transition core contributors from holdings to the DAO. This budget includes positioning the identity layer of Grants 2.0, elevating Gitcoin\u2019s media profile, refreshing our visual identity, and defining a clear contributor onboarding experience.   Introducing Steward Health Cards 2.0 by sidcode and Fred announces that the newest version of the Steward Health Cards are live. These cards help increase transparency and accountability by gauging steward engagement and providing valuable metrics about each steward. The latest version was built in partnership with Karma, a reputation system for DAO contributors, and enables us to grab richer data and more granular metrics. Lots of exciting new features and a complete revamp of the backend provides more accurate data than ever!     DAO Operations    DAO Operations S14 Budget Request by Jodi seeks 179k GTC to operationalize Gitcoin DAO and offer non-binding best practices for workstreams. This includes defining best practices for DAO tooling, workstream accounting, payments, and treasury diversification. DAO Ops would also ensure the top stewards are engaged in holding workstreams accountable, while streamlining contributor onboarding, and providing clear, accessible People Ops guidance for the workplace.   We are hiring! We need a Support Lead.   We passed a CSDO (Cross-Stream DAO Ops) proposal from Joe to have 60 days of reserves built into workstream budgets.     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us. Afterwards there is the Gitcoin Contributors Happy-Hour starting at 13.30PM ET.   Community Onboarding Call! New to Gitcoin? The next event will be Monday, May 9th from 1:00 to 2:00 PM EST. We\u2019ll tell you all about how we\u2019re organized and how you can become an active contributor.

Hot Topics:   Get all the details on Grants Round 14! We have over 3 million available in matching funding, split across:  One main round ($1M+) 3 Cause Rounds (Climate; Crypto advocacy; Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) 14 Ecosystem Rounds (Ethereum Infrastructure, ZK-Tech, ENS; Polygon, Radicle, Open Gaming, Subgraph Scholarships, Web3 Social, Unlock Protocol, Aurora, Protocol Labs, Celo, Lootverse, Oakland)    Kyle provides an update on the Foundation established to represent GitcoinDAO. The Foundation has a draft of bylaws that define GTC token holders as beneficiaries of the Foundation and empowers a board of directors to execute DAO resolutions. In addition, three subsidiaries of the foundation have been formed:  one for holding intellectual property (trademarks, software), one for operations and payments, and one for Grants Multisig custody to handle KYC and AML requirements.    Elliot from Llama provides May financial statements for the DAO showing we claimed ~19M GTC from our time-locked vester account.   Kevin Olsen proposes we implement a carbon neutral policy at Gitcoin and shares a working doc from the team at KlimaDAO. The document estimates our \u201ctotal on-chain emissions to date, representing all trading of GTC, all donations made during our grants rounds, and our grants payouts across Mainnet, ZKSsync, and Polygon.\u201d This amounts to 2068 tCO2e, but \u201cless the amount already offset and in the treasury, we have 1862 tons to purchase. If we do this with NCT our offset for Phase 1 will cost $4.52 * 1862 = $8416.24.\u201d   Simona Pop writes and shares a reflection on DAO governance that quickly received over 150 retweets. In the article, Simona says \u201cEvolving DAOs feels like building a house on quicksand. During an earthquake. In the rain. It\u2019s all about balance. It\u2019s an extreme exercise in balance above everything else.\" Simona also points out four key pillars for maintaining balance in a DAO:  having standards of information flow, holding space for engagement, seeking equilibrium between extremes, and requesting responsibility.

We\u2019re keeping our communications lively, making sure projects get tagged appropriately, and keeping the whole machine moving.   Keep an eye out for upcoming live events about GR14! The next one we\u2019ll be hosting on our Twitter is: June 14th @ 7 PM UTC: GR14 Climate Round Panel w/ Ayowecca Uganda, Holly Grimm, William of Helios   We\u2019ve worked with our partners from Llama to put together a v1 framework for a mutual grant with Radicle. This grant would swap 500k GTC for an equivalent value of RAD to make each DAO a top 10 delegate in the other\u2019s governance. This framework proposes that each DAO create a 3-person committee (of 2 DAO members and 1 Llama member) to focus on metagovernance and voting.     Moonshot Collective    Gitcoin Passport: Partnering with Grants 2.0 workstream, we completed our MVP and launched it in time for GR14. We\u2019re continuously making UI/UX improvements as we learn from the feedback we\u2019re receiving.   Governance Operations Scaling: We\u2019re working on a draft post to share on the governance forum and seek feedback from our community. We\u2019re currently researching governance implementations and brainstorming prototype solutions.   Operations: We completed moving our contributor payment processes to Utopia Labs to simplify payment flows. We implemented a new, clean weekly progress format in our Notion.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Grants Intelligence Agency: We are super busy with GR14 but still approving grants in under 48 hours! We are using Ethelo to coordinate checking grant eligibility for GR14 side rounds.   Data Operations:  We\u2019re running our Sybil Account Detection model to keep GR14 as safe and secure as possible.   Community Intelligence: We\u2019re analyzing grants based on the wording and sentence structure to identify common patterns among those engaging in fraudulent behavior.   Operating System: We passed a governance proposal to expand the group of people (\u201coutcome owners\u201d) who have voting rights within the workstream. We did some spring cleaning of our Discord and Notion to keep ourselves looking and feeling fresh.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We kicked-off GR14 with a live DAO Vibes, a video tweet thread, and a recorded Twitter space for diversity, equity, and inclusion grants. We will continue to be super active in our engagement channels to amplify this grants round and #ReFiSummer   We\u2019re working to evolve our content strategy and developing a content strategy handbook.   We\u2019re running peer reviews among our most active contributors to gather feedback for improvement.     DAO Operations    CSDO: This week we discussed reworking the DAO\u2019s purpose and essential intents, not needing to spin up a formal workstream for Schelling Point, and the season 15 budgeting process based on the season 14 budget retrospectives.   Loie and Saf wrote a Compensation Commitment advocating for transparent salaries, U.S-based market benchmarks, approval requirements for core contributor salaries, and stablecoin denomination.   We are piloting Gilded Finance for financial reporting and will share our reflections     Grants 2.0    Gitcoin Passport: Together with the Moonshot Collective, we launched at passport.gitcoin.co in time for GR14! We completed the final stamp, for BrightID, and are making UX/UI changes as we gather feedback. We have a video demo live.   Grants Hub: We have built out all of our high-fidelity mockups in our dapp and are about 90% of the way to hitting our MVP milestone. Our latest demo is available   Round Manager/Explorer: We finished fleshing out our smart contracts and tested deployment on Goerli. We have a steel thread UI that we will begin connecting to contracts next week   Find more details in our weekly update thread.

Key actions for this week:   Vote on Tally for workstream budget proposals! If you\u2019re a workstream contributor please fill out this quick survey for the Year-in-Review!    Hot Topics:   Owocki proposes a weekly Grants 2.0 progress thread to \u201ccreate a drumbeat of progress\u201d and \u201callow for course correction (if needed) early.\u201d Leon quickly delivers. The thread highlights that dPopp is well on its way to having an MVP by GR14 and has a demo available. In addition, the Grants Hub \u201caims to be production-ready by July 1st when we\u2019ll prompt projects in Gitcoin Grants to migrate over\u201d and also has a demo available.   Annika\u2019s post on GR14 Round Structure and Grants Eligibility has forty-one responses in just three days! Much of the discussion revolves around whether grants with tokens should be eligible. Several posters point out that NFTs are tokens. Connor succinctly summarizes the opposing viewpoints:  \u201cOption 1: No token policy stays, but projects that want to can apply for an exception and can be approved after a review (case by case basis) Option 2: Token policy is updated with some general guidelines and thresholds, but projects still are applying anyway when opening a grant and are always subject to review and approval (case by case basis)\u201d    Owocki points out that GitcoinDAO\u2019s starting conditions are different from other DAOs because it started as a corporation. While DAOs can start as a \u201cstructureless primordial soup (like yearn)\u201d they need not so long as they \u201cprogressively decentralize over time.\u201d One consequence of starting as a US tech company is that salary compensation is higher than other DAOs. Owocki questions if GitcoinDAO can continue to pay these rates without a model for financial sustainability.   Owocki outlines a vision for GitcoinDAO\u2019s final form which starts with a clear north star of empowering \u201ccommunities to build & fund their shared needs.\u201d Our ability to do this will be expanded by Grants 2.0 which will make Gitcoin a ProtocolDAO and be built on \u201ca highly liquid grants registry, which can be interoperable with other registries of grants.\u201d By coordinating with other registries or DAOs, we scale our Impact Network, and \u201cthe end result is a DAO of DAOs. A densely integrated network of projects and contributors that all rise and fall together.\u201d This is \u201cMaximum Coordination.\u201d   Elliot from Llama shares the March and April 2022 treasury report showing a treasury with over 99% GTC, roughly 8.8M tokens, worth $40.1M at time of calculation. Using today\u2019s prices this shows a treasury balance of $23.7M   Sean shares a tribute in memory of GitcoinDAO\u2019s contributor Jemimah Jones who tragically passed from complications due to sickle cell anemia. Jemimah once said of GitcoinDAO \u201cI\u2019ve discovered the world\u2019s best workplace, guaranteed to make you laugh, cry (good tears), and scream to the skies that you\u2019re the happiest person on Earth.\u201d Sean asks \u201cCan we become the \u201cworkplace\u201d that Jemimah imagined we could be? Can we challenge ourselves to believe as strongly in ourselves as she did?\u201d We miss you Jemimah.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC holders and delegates.

We propose keeping the round structure split into three components:  A main pool (of up to $1M), Roughly ten ecosystem rounds (including one focused on Ethereum protocol devs), Three cause rounds (climate, advocacy, DEI).    We also recommend removing the criteria that grants must not have a token in order to be eligible for funding. In doing so, we continue moving in the direction of the community answering \u2018what is a public good\u2019 through what they choose to fund. We will gather feedback in the forum, then revise, and move this proposal to Snapshot.   We are excited to share that we\u2019ve secured just over $2 Million in funding for Grants Round 14 and have another $500k in outstanding, potential deals.     Moonshot Collective    We recorded a demo of our dPOPP (decentralized proof of personhood passport) project!   We\u2019ve begun work on researching and learning about conviction voting to explore how it could be used at Gitcoin. We are interested in increasing steward engagement and creating new mechanisms to incentivize active involvement.   We are expanding our community to include hackathon winners and ensure MC is the core builder community for Gitcoin   Episode 14 of the Green Pill Podcast hosted by Kevin Owocki is live! Special guest Ale Borda, co-author of the ImpactDAO Book, exudes regen in this discussion about what ImpactDAOs are, how to get involved with them, and why she entered the Web3 space.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    We conducted a snapshot survey of the squads and principles of our workstream to gather consensus on what is most important to the DAO. We\u2019ve updated our season 14 budget proposal with this feedback. We are giving stewards granular options on how much to fund us from the bare minimum needed for round execution ($223k) to the amount needed for improvement ($370k), innovation ($405k), or expansion of the workstream ($465k). The most expensive of these options is still a 17% budget reduction from our initial proposal.   Sirlupinwatson shares Learning Sybil Resistance (Work-In-Progress) Part.3 where he breaks down different types of sybil attacks and how to defend against them. A sybil attack occurs when \u201cone person creates multiple identities in order to masquerade as another user or group of users.\u201d Sybil attacks can be executed by using bot accounts, posting on multiple accounts, leaving fake reviews, and submitting fake votes. Sybil attacks can be defended against using trusted identities that a person can only have one of or by using just-in-time authentication.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Did you catch the Wired Magazine article about EthDenver featuring Gitcoin and Owocki?   We\u2019re ramping up for GR14 and have prepared designs with a theme of \u201cReFi Summer.\u201d We are also launching the beginning of our marketing campaign   We\u2019re building out an awesome year-in-review for GitcoinDAO\u2019s first birthday!

Key actions for this week:  Vote on Gitcoin Product Collective\u2019s Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15!    Hot Topics:   Gitcoin Product Collective\u2019s Budget Proposal garners support and drums up excitement across much of the DAO. Some stewards comment on the high budget being requested ($1.44M when including 60 days reserves) but declare that it\u2019s well worth it for the future of Gitcoin. Additionally, Lindsey shares a deck with details about how the team will seek partners to help design the future of the protocol.   Schelling Point Event Workstream Setup Proposal receives widespread support from members and stewards within the DAO with several people raising the question \u201cwhat is a workstream lite?\u201d. Simona answers: \u201cessentially it means that it does not carry bulk. It is an agile, streamlined workstream that comes together twice a year then dissipates and that it funds itself. There will be no budget proposals from this workstream.\u201d   Owocki invites the community to provide feedback on how he should update his delegations in an effort to create more transparency and provides his tentative updates. Kyle also shares his updated steward delegations for Season 15. Both delegations reflect a shfit toward emphasizing Grants 2.0 and the leadership of Lindsey Thrift and Kevin Olsen.   In Llama\u2019s Gitcoin Treasury Runway Analysis, myceliumcoordinator and epowell101 enter the fray to criticize the analysis for not doing enough. Coordinator requests an analysis that includes different confidence intervals for each outcome. Powell points out that the analysis assumes the treasury has a static value of $134M when the current circulating supply of GTC is only $32M and says \u201cthere is no way that our treasury can actually be worth 4-5x the entire circulating market cap.\u201d   Owocki updates on the result of his request for Impact Certificate Proposals. The top 5 proposals each won a $2k reward. Congratulations to Digital Gaia, Protein, Ethelo/Ashoka, Impact Oracle, and Crowdmuse! Gitcoin is also \u201cin the early stages of forming a partnership with Protocols Labs\u201d to identify how Gitcoin Grants, Impact Certificates, and other primitives can be a part of a thriving public goods funding ecosystem.   Ben from ScopeLift introduces flexible voting, \u201can extension to the Governor contracts that enables delegates to split their voting weight across For, Against, and Abstain on any given proposal\u201d   Check out the latest episode of the Green Pill Podcast, where Kevin Owocki brings on Daniel Schmachtenberger, a founding member of the consilience project. This episode features a deep dive on the metacrisis facing our species and how we can find a way out.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15    Proposal Discussions:  Schelling Point Event Workstream Setup Proposal Upgrading the Gitcoin Governance Contracts Improve GTC Liquidity with Tokemak  Carbon Neutral Policy at Gitcoin    Latest Completed Proposals:   $3 Million Treasury Diversification   Result: Passed    Ratify the results of Grants Round 14 and formally request the community multisig holders to payout matching allocations  Result: Passed        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    On July 15th, we officially made GR14 matching funds available for grantees to claim.   We\u2019re gearing up for GR15 by locking down matching fund partners and outlining a clear strategy and timeline for our operations.     Moonshot Collective    Governance Operations Scaling: We\u2019ve made the difficult decision to put this initiative on pause. Although we still see value in building a tool that enables fluid, granular, and informed voting instead of binary decisions, we recognize that in the current market downturn the DAO needs to be focused on work that is more closely aligned with our purpose and essential intents.   Passport Identity Staking: We\u2019ve kicked off a new initiative to aid our Sybil Resistance efforts by allowing users to stake on identity. We\u2019ve completed initial inception and discovery work. Now, we\u2019re moving quickly toward building a prototype with Scaffold-Eth.   Operations: We\u2019re gearing up for Season 15 by clarifying timelines, preparing for budget season, and working on drafting our OKRs. On the compensation side, we paid out all active contributors and are writing a standard compensation policy.   Emu writes Moonshot Accountabilities; a contributor joint outlining the level of accountability for core, trusted, and citizen contributors. Core contributors \u201cproactively participate in the strategic planning of the workstream, while also driving the execution of work towards our initiatives.\u201d Trusted contributors are considered for initiative teams but are not continuously staffed, and allowed great flexibility. Citizen contributors are the most common, sometimes staffed, and are invited to participate in context calls.     Fraud Detection & Defense    The FDD Review is a new communication series calling for honest critics to inform the community about what goes on inside FDD and provide feedback. This initiative comes \u201cafter a difficult restructuring and realignment sparked by the Season 14 Budget Request process, we learned that our communication was subpar.\u201d   Joseph Cook authors the first post in this series: Rethinking FDD in which he makes the point that \u201cFDD should stop asking \u201cHow do we stop fraud\u201d? and start asking \u201cHow can we optimally allocate capital\u201d?\u201d One solution is measuring how well capital is allocated by surveying the community on what they\u2019re interested in seeing funded and comparing it with the actual outcome.      Merch, Memes & Marketing    This week, we conducted our retrospective on Grants Round 14 and identified a need to create a content marketing strategy, start grants round marketing earlier, and tighten our partnership with the PGF workstream.   We\u2019re continuing the migration of our email and website to Hubspot and are excited about the new features this will unlock!   CoachJonathan shared our methods and early results from Experiments in Governance at MMM. In order to improve the clarity and process of our decision-making, we have implemented a three-phase system for proposals to become governance.  Phase 1: Proposals are conceived on discord or google docs. Phase 2: Proposals go on Murmur where we ask questions and decide if it should pass. Phase 3: If a proposal passes on Murmur, it is codified in our knowledgebase.      DAO Operations    CSDO: At this week\u2019s meeting, we discussed our preparation for Season 15 including timeline and proposal process. The CSDO will discuss budget drafts internally over the next two weeks with drafts going on the forum by July 25th for comments. Season 15 will kick off August 1st and budgets should be proposed on snapshot by August 15th. Then, funds should be in workstreams multisigs by August 29th.    Grants 2.0    Grants Hub: We are finishing up the last pieces on our path to production: implementing pinata.cloud as a storage solution, and auditing our smart contracts. We\u2019ve also conducted two user research sessions to identify what works and what doesn\u2019t work for our users. Lastly, our latest demo shows off the user flow for reviewing and creating new projects!   Round Manager: We\u2019re focusing on ensuring our product creates a publicly available record of all grant programs and rounds. In order to do that, we\u2019re utilizing an IPFS pinning service and storing a link to our pinned files in our smart contracts. Additionally, we\u2019ve made our smart contracts upgradeable to ensure we don\u2019t lose any links. Lastly, we have created high-fidelity designs for our MVP and are aiming for an August 1st launch date!     Upcoming community events   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.
