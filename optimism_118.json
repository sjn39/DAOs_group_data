USD+ stablecoin can be instantly minted and redeemed to USDC 1:1. USD+ includes 3 components:  Pegged to USDC 1:1   100% collateralized with assets immediately convertible into USDC \u2018Risk-first portfolio\u2019, i.e., assets are picked primarily to avoid losses on a daily basis (3-4 sigmas away from 0), no exposure to algorithmic stables USD+ can replace USDC in pools and lending protocols   Yield generating   Collateral consists of yield-bearing strategies, including lending and stable-to-stable pools Portfolio allocation decentrally controlled (community proposals, veto power by token stakers/insurance providers) Portfolio strategy executed decentrally via smart-contracts Profit paid out daily in USD+ via rebase   Insurance (soon)  Optimism alignment: Because of its cutting-edge technology and the Optimism collective\u2019s overall mission, Overnight sees Optimism as one of the most promising scaling options. It\u2019s fascinating because this can develop a story beyond just producing money. We consider Optimism to be the ideal basis for creating the most cutting-edge decentralized exchange in the world. The magic of USD+ is that this extends to Liquidity Pools and makes Yield-Farming even more profitable. This opens the gateways to a new era of Yield-Farming and reduces the reliance on Gauge Pool rewards (farming tokens) as a primary incentive for LPs as USD+ contributes to making them more lucrative:  Users provide liquidity into USD+ pools and get USD+ yield on top of LP fees and rewards Everyone can pair token with USD+ and passively grow token\u2019s price thanks to the USD+ yield-bearing nature.  Liquidity Pairs with USD+ have an advantage over other stablecoins like USDC owing to the APY generated via its Yields. Think of USD+ as essentially USDC, it\u2019s liquid, hassle-free, pegged to USDC but with an added bonus of passive income. When paired in Liquidity Pools, USD+ generates increased returns for Liquidity Providers. Overtime, increased returns on Liquidity Pools can be increasingly rare and at often times, unsustainable \u2014 this gap is filled by USD+.  0*zXYu143K1UpT2M-L1400\u00d7787 231 KB   FVgQt5tUYAEye3Y1920\u00d71281 156 KB  As well USD+ achieved #3 on Polygon dApps with the highest weekly trading volumes (a net of max. ~$5.1M). We believe that USD+ on Optimism will lead to an increase in trading volumes on both the Velodrome (following the example of Dystopia) as well as on Uni V3. Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? OP tokens will incentivize LPs USD+ pairs on Velodrome, such as USD+/USDC, USD+/OP, and USD+/ETH. This consists of adding extra incentives on top of the auto-compounding LP tokens and USD+ rebases. This will provide above-market APYs to the pools and be seen by Overnight users, making them want to bridge to Optimism. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? USD+ is designed to make liquidity mining makes even more profitable. Offering USD+ rebases, and incentives specifically on Optimism will encourage users to move their assets to Optimism for better return rates. Since USD+ acts as an add-on for many projects, people coming to USD+ are not only using the USD+ platform - They\u2019re interacting with DEXs, liquidity protocols, and more. That means users have a breadth of usage on Optimism, not just on a single dapp. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Liquidity Provisions are ever-more profitable with USD+. LPs with USD+ reap APYs from USD+ as well, massively increasing profitability and returns on Yield-Farms. USD+ APYs result in both sides of tokens with the said LP increasing in $ value. This auto-compounded effect increases LP token quantity allowing you to grow position and earn more rewards from Gauge Pools with the very same set of LPs without any of the leg-work involved. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We cannot set a deadline for distribution because it is directly impacted by the fees the protocol generates. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Overnight\u2019s stablecoin, USD+ is a yield-bearing asset generating rewards for its holders on a daily horizon via a rebase mechanism. These rewards are financed via Overnight\u2019s carefully selected Yield-Farming strategies ",

USD+ is USDC that pays the users\u2019 yield daily via rebase. The advantage of yield-generating stablecoins is that nothing is required from the holder \u2013 no staking, nor unstaking \u2013 the yield just accumulates in one\u2019s wallet daily via positive rebases. USD+ offers increased returns & unique benefits for Yield-Farmers & protocols respectively as USD+ is a self-appreciating token via its rebases. More info: The + in Liquidity Pools: Why Liquidity Pairs with USD+ are more Capital Efficient | by Overnight | May, 2022 | Medium So, the answer is no. With the grant we can provide APY above average. Our co-incentives are to generate yield with USD+ rebase to OP users and the high trading volume for protocols. ",

I went to your website and tried to understand how the system works.   2022-07-09_23-20897\u00d7548 62.7 KB  What do you mean by assets immediately convertible to USDC? Which assets are that?  2022-07-09_23-21918\u00d7600 61.6 KB  Drilling further it seems that these assets are other yield bearing tokens? Like say cUSDC and aUSDC in Compound and Aave respectively? Can you explain the \u201cProfit paid out daily in USD+ via rebase\u201d a bit more? So you wrap various yield bearing tokens in a new token. You call it USD+ \u2026 and then how do you generate more yield for your users on top of the standard yield that they would get from the normal yield bearing tokens? \u201cVia rebase\u201d does not really explain it. EDIT: Okay for this question got some answers in Twitter: https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1545884720914890753  Why not wait with the proposal until you are live on Optimism? Why not wait when you can offer co-incentives? You mention you will have a governance token soon.  ",

Stable-to-stable pools tend to generate higher yield than things like AAVE, but also involve certain costs that require careful portfolio management. Yield generated by the collateral is paid out via rebase, meaning that when the value of the collateral exceeds 100% of USD+ in circulation, the USD+ is rebased for the collaterization to reach 100%. Below is the picture of USD+ portfolio on Polygon - we run online mark-to-market valuation of the portfolio and contrast it to the amount of USD+.

We missed on veNFT distribution by Velo, otherwise we would be live by now. maybe, the way to go is approving the funding subject to our deployment? i.e. funds are disbursed only after the product is live on OP?   we planned on issuing the governance token but won\u2019t do that soon because of the market conditions. this has been delayed until the end of the bear market essentially.   when talking about incentives it is important to understand our model: we do give incentives to USD+ holders, simply in the form of the yield they receive via rebase. the way to think about it could be that rebase is actually an incentive in USD+ stablecoins. Users absolutely prefer stablecoin incentives to those in governance tokens. this is also important to understand why other stablecoins provide incentives, in particular, lending protocols like LUSD or Qi DAO. Their model is to generate revenue from lending and issuing the stablecoin is like issuing the \u2018variable coupon bond\u2019, i.e. the funding mechanism. They take revenue from lending and pay out \u00e7oupon\u2019 in the form of token incentives (or at least thats how it is supposed to work sustainably). Because of the differences in the models, we believe, a different standard in terms of incentive matching is appropriate ",

I\u2019ll also be voting No, on balance. I\u2019m not a fan of liquidity mining programs, but do appreciate that it\u2019ll promote growth on Optimism in certain cases. However, as others have noted, I\u2019d like to see your protocol deployed on Optimism and see what sort of activity it gains first. Your success on Polygon is promising, but we need more information about your commitment to Optimism. ",

People buy yield and for us it would be impossible to match the yield of those players that are already being subsidized by OP/Velo without this grant. this is a bit of weird situation, as we have an innovative and competitive product, but the grants/subsidies, despite being meant to stimulate growth, have created a major barrier to [our] entry ",

Asking the OP community to fund every new entrant up to the level of existing players is a very slippery slope. I acknowledge the uneven playing field, but I\u2019d rather move the other incentives down than bring everyone else up Going to be a no so far from me. However, if you can tweak your incentives to put OP in users hands another way, I\u2019m interested. Example: \u201cClick here to try Overnight.fi on Optimism and receive 100 OP!\u201d Open that up, once, to all your existing Polygon users. It encourages exploration of the L2 without dumping them right back onto the market. Locking the OP, or scaling up OP rewards by electing to lock instead of dump, etc. Those are also interesting pivots. As another member said, it would also show you\u2019re here (here specifically) to play. It puts your protocol in good light for further rounds of funding too ",
