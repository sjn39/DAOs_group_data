                    "content": "Centrifuge and @christiancdpeterson (and of course the RWF CU) have been working closely over the past two months to bring forward an updated legal structure for the benefit of the MakerDAO. We have presented this new structure to the community in a post here and at an AMA. The details of the legal structure are designed to support the goals of MakerDAO and the technical capabilities of the Centrifuge protocol. We at Centrifuge believe it is worth the time and effort and cost to get this right. With an agreed template, we can then roll this out with our first pools and we will then have a scalable solution that can provide the necessary protections to the Maker community . This solution would also be open sourced for anyone in the Maker community to use and iterate upon. Today, we want to delve a bit deeper into the details of this new legal structure to clarify some of its key elements: the trust indenture and the indenture trustee. What is a trust indenture? A trust indenture is an agreement typically used in a bond offering. It is a contract between the bond issuer and a trustee that documents the terms and conditions governing the trustee\u2019s conduct as well as the trust beneficiaries\u2019 (bondholders, tokenholders, etc.) rights. The trust indenture represents the interests of the bondholder by underlining a set of rules and responsibilities that each entity party to the agreement is obliged to follow. A trust indenture also includes certain directives regarding the circumstances that may lead to a default and the processes that need to be followed thereupon (examples below). In the context of the Centrifuge pools, the trust indenture we are proposing will represent the interests of the tokenholders particularly MakerDAO as DROP holders. What is an indenture trustee? The trust indenture creates the role of the indenture trustee. The indenture trustee is a third party intermediary that manages the relationship between an issuer and holders of the issuer\u2019s securities (or in this case tokens). The indenture trustee handles administrative matters relating to the securities such as payment processing and ensures that the issuer complies with the terms of the trust indenture governing the terms of the securities and the rights and obligations of the issuer, the trustee and the holders. Companies licensed to carry on the business of a trust company generally act as the indenture trustee. Examples of trust companies include WSFS, Delaware Trust, First State Trust Company, etc. Indenture trustees act for the benefit of the investors in a company\u2019s debt securities which in the case of the Centrifuge pools are the DROP and TIN tokens. In the United States, an indenture trustee role exists in virtually all bond offerings. As you can see, the use of an indenture trustee in conjunction with the Centrifuge pools will substantially decrease the risks associated with the collateral for the Maker community. In a non-default scenario, the indenture trustee will be able to provide assurance that the payment flows from the issuer to the tokenholders cannot be tampered with or diverted. Most importantly the indenture trustee will be able to act on behalf of the tokenholders in case of a default by the issuer. The types of actions that the indenture trustee would undertake in a typical default situation are:  Poll the tokenholders and obtain a decision whether there should be a restructuring or temporary forbearance Solicit direction from the tokenholder investors on selection of counsel and/or a financial advisor if necessary At the direction of the tokenholders, coordinate between counsel, the issuer and the financial advisor for the liquidation of the collateral Distribute the proceeds of the liquidation to the tokenholders  The specifics of the mechanisms for the above steps will depend on the precise default scenario and the type of collateral involved as well as the exact terms and conditions of the trust indenture. We hope that this explanatory post will allow the community to better understand the need for such arrangements and we expect to be sharing further posts on other aspects of the new legal structure.

It would need to be adapted for a non-US SPV depending on the trust rules in the place of incorporation of the SPV (e.g., Cayman, Jersey etc.) It is not different than a senior secured type of loan, but it is a structure more commonly used in the bond markets for example for asset-backed securities. Normally, in lending facilities a trustee is not needed because the lenders are already connected and can work together. A trustee is needed in bond markets where the bondholders need to have a third party act on their behalf. In case of default, the trustee would foreclose on the pledges and liquidate the collateral held by the SPV and then distribute the proceeds from the liquidation sale to the tokenholders based on the agreed waterfall. I don\u2019t know the ES process so I can\u2019t answer the last question. Maybe @christiancdpetersen can help with this. ",
