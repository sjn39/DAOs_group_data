How This Table Works Let\u2019s take January 2023:  image1359\u00d7105 9.74 KB  (Note that your displayed time may differ. I\u2019ve set my system to UTC to grab this screenshot)  January\u2019s Formal Submission Window spans Monday 2-Wednesday 4. If a proposal is first published in the forum on December 7, 2022, it will be eligible for Formal Submission on the very last day of January\u2019s Formal Submission Window, January 4. If the proposal is published after December 7, it will have to wait until February\u2019s Formal Submission Window (February 6, 7, 8). Remember that proposals must remain unchanged for at least one week before their formal submission.  ",
