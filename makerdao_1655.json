                    "content": "In this post I will go over the the basic timeline of the Endgame Plan, including when and under what conditions it is possible that Dai could go free floating. The most important takeaway is this:  Dai will remain 1:1 with USD for at least 3 years The timeline for free floating away from 1:1 with USD would be delayed if there is no immediate authoritarian threat The 1:1 peg with USD would remain indefinitely if the protocol can reach and maintain 75% decentralized collateral During the initial 3 years the protocol will actually double down on RWA in order to accumulate as much ETH as possible, increasing the ratio of decentralized collateral  The \u201ccollateral strategy\u201d is what determines the makeup of Dai\u2019s collateral assets, and decides how much RWA exposure Dai will have, including whether going free floating will be necessary. The Endgame Plan proposes 3 different collateral strategies, called Stances, that lie on a spectrum of high RWA exposure to 0 RWA exposure. More RWA exposure enables higher growth, but at the cost of less resilience. The three stances are called Pigeon Stance, Eagle Stance and Phoenix Stance  pigeons1124\u00d7619 338 KB  The protocol begins in Pigeon Stance, and the earliest it can switch to Eagle Stance is after 3 years. During Pigeon Stance the protocol uses all of its RWA to maximize its profit potential, and uses all generated surplus to accumulate as much ETH as possible. The protocol by default automatically switches out of the vulnerable Pigeon Stance and into the more balanced Eagle Stance after 3 years, to reduce risk based on the assumption that the authoritarian threat against RWA collateral will grow over time. This is implemented as a \u201cDifficulty Bomb\u201d - it is automatically triggered, but the community can choose to delay it by replacing it with a new difficulty bomb that is further out in the future. Delaying the switch to Eagle Stance and remaining in Pigeon Stance is safe if there is clear evidence that Dai is not in immediate danger of an authoritarian attack to seize its RWA collateral. This will allow the protocol to accumulate even more ETH and is the best choice for long term resilience, if the short term risk will allow it. If the protocol reaches 75% decentralized collateral organically from the accumulation of ETH during Pigeon Stance, then it can switch to Eagle Stance without resulting in Dai going free floating. Phoenix Stance which eliminates all vulnerable RWA exposure is triggered if there is clear evidence of an incoming authoritarian attack, or if one has already happened and all of Dai\u2019s RWA collateral has been seized. In the long run, the protocol can still do RWA collateral even if Phoenix Stance, but it has to be \u201cPhysically Resilient RWA\u201d that is not possible to simply seize through a legal or political order by a global authority. This can either be achieved through technical means, such as blockchain-connected, remote-controlled drone ships, or by achieving deep political integration in a stable democracy that ensures protection from selfish political moves through a voter backlash. For this reason, Maker should never stop attempting to do RWA projects, and should always maintain active efforts to evangelize DeFi, RWA and their benefits to people, as this will both enable it to remain in Pigeon Stance longer and become more resilient from ETH accumulation, and it will also enable to eventually deploy Physically Resilient RWA that is long term viable even in a world of severe authoritarian threats and instability.

On this point (emphasis added):     rune:  In the long run, the protocol can still do RWA collateral even if Phoenix Stance, but it has to be \u201cPhysically Resilient RWA\u201d that is not possible to simply seize through a legal or political order by a global authority. This can either be achieved through technical means [\u2026] or by achieving deep political integration in a stable democracy that ensures protection from selfish political moves through a voter backlash.   This latter possibility is genuinely plausible if DAI/Maker (and other DeFi protocols) is able to grow and eventually achieve widespread adoption. There are plenty of examples of this occurring with other technologies, both in the present and historically - it\u2019s a phenomenon in law and technology known as the Collingridge Dilemma. Essentially, when technologies are new and novel, governments struggle to regulate them because of information asymmetries - they don\u2019t understand the technology or its future impacts. When technologies become widely used, governments then struggle to regulate because social and political support for that tech becomes entrenched. Collingridge\u2019s own example of choice was the automobile. Maker has a long way to go, of course, but I agree with Rune that the possibility alone is a strong reason to continue work on RWA, and extolling the benefits of decentralized finance. ",

In the event of a crypto market crash, we could be forced to liquidate quite a bit of RWAs. This will make us less reliable as a business partner and means Dai cannot be a safe haven for capital during unstable markets.   If Dai loses market share in decentralized collateral(for example, Aave outcompetes us on providing leverage), then we will be forced to scale down the protocol instead of pivoting to RWAs.   ",

The risks of government overreach can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. And there are certainly other business opprotunities outside of real-world assets that matter.

Cuz if people are going to be exposed to a \u201cstablecoin\u201d that doesn\u2019t follow any certain value, don\u2019t you think DAI just will lose all its impact?   I\u2019m wondering about this as well.  I think in DeFi there will be a divergence in protocols as regulators catch up - protocols may either be \u201csuper clean\u201d (i.e., pegged to USD, for white-listed / KYC clients only, \u201cregulator-friendly\u201d) or totally algorithmic / agnostic to \u201cTradFi\u201d norms (i.e., not pegged to USD, for any client regardless of capital source).  To the extent regulators lay down the law on DeFi protocols, the former will outperform.  It could be worth maintaining the USD peg in the medium-term (longer than three years), since that\u2019s been core to Maker for so long anyway, and could end up leading to market share grab as other DeFi protocols fall behind.

What if authoritarian RWA seizures happen earlier, or if the protocol can develop attractive solutions to free-float DAI? Can Eagle Stance be activated before the three year mark, or is that a hard cap?   I have the same question that I would love to know the answer to. Three years is a long time, regulations will probably come before that time. What would be Maker\u2019s plan of action in case these regulations become too aggressive? Is there a contingency plan for this case? ",

The full Eagle Stance / Phoenix Stance dynamic can be understood as a proposed contingency plan. This might help, from the Endgame v3 overview (emphasis added):    Endgame Plan v3 complete overview   Eagle Stance is becomes active after 2.5 years of Pigeon Stance, or in a rare situation where it provides a clear regulatory benefit to not have a 1:1 pegged stablecoin. It is named after the Theodore Roosevelt quote: \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d Eagle Stance guarantees that Maker\u2019s exposure to seizable RWA is limited to no more than 25%, and to achieve this Dai in unpegged from the dollar if necessary. The result is that Dai is able to survive even the most severe regulatory crackdown or physical attack, but at the same isn\u2019t severing its ties with the real world and is still able to take advantage of RWA liquidity and Clean Money projects that demonstrate the positive impact of letting DeFi flourish.   I\u2019m still thinking about these questions and the extent to which Maker can truly shield itself from regulators (if even 20-25% of Maker RWA was \u2018seized\u2019, that still seems like a probable death blow to the protocol). But that\u2019s an answer to your question, still. ",

I mean, is it achievable in 3 years? -This 3 year minimum window for the depeg to take place, can we get some more clarification on how it was determined? Were the upcoming legal restrictions taken into consideration? I suppose they were, but 3 years seems to me to be a very long time. ",
