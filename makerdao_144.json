Dial In Details Zoom call Passcode: RWA-WG  Intro An open discussion where we discuss projects and potential assets for MCD, open for anyone to join. If you\u2019d like to present, check out this thread.  Agenda Intro by @Juan Presentation by TBD  REIF: Commercial Real Estate Fund \u2014 https://www.reif.finance/  MIP6: [REIF-DROP] REFI DROP: Commercial Real Estate Assets  REIF intends to establish relationships with a number of trusted and reliable asset originators across North America with the intent of supplying risk capital to finance and obtain loan assets backed by commercial real estate. These assets are expected to yield above-market risk-adjusted returns and bear material collateral coverage to protect the assets from downside risk. The REIF Pool will help finance value-add commercial real estate projects with an average loan amount of $10,000,000 (ten million) for the 1st position product and $500,000 (five hundred thousand) for the 2nd position product. The 1st position product is for acquisition, equity takeout, and refinancing of commercial real estate loans. The 2nd position product is for renovations, development, or leasehold improvements of the properties. The maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) leverage to be considered for financing of the 1st position product is to be 70% of the asset value and the maximum LTV leverage to be considered for financing of the 2nd position product is to be 80% of asset value. The asset values will be verified by a third party. The term of the loans will be 12 and 24 months as determined on a case-by-case basis.

On your chart, it varied from two months to four years. What are you aiming at?   38:42 - Eric: Is Coral involved in the transaction? I know that they are the owner of REIF. Is there any enough support being provided through Coral?   39:15 - Eric: Are you CEO of REIF? And you also have a senior role with Forge & Foster? If there became financial distress in an investment, you could wind up in two different seats. One is an equity investor, the other is a debt investor. How would you manage to have two sets of interests that are not always aligned?    40:33 - Eric: It feels like you will wind up fighting against yourself if there is distress. Are you comfortable with that? You would have to wear two hats that will not be perfectly aligned in distress.   43:06 - Eric: Are the tenants already lease-assigned when you do the deals? What is the occupancy when you close on a deal?   43:52 - Eric: In terms of your product, did you say that banks do not typically want to do it or they do not want to be in the first lien?   46:09 - Eric: In terms of portfolio diversification, how do you think about the different industries? I know there are not long exposures, but how much medical do you want versus another one, etc.?   47:04 - Eric: For this deal, could it be a single transaction, or is it going to be a series of different projects together?   47:54 - Eric: Is there going to be some concentration around industry exposure at the portfolio level? When you think about medical versus RV, etc.?   48:54 - Planet_X: I have a question with regards to the AAA lenders. What size of deals do you need to have to approach them?    49:59 - Eric: This is probably a Forge & Forest question. What experience have you had since your beginning around workout financial distress? If you have had any of those situations, how do you manage them? How do you typically structure a deal with covenants and triggers to get yourselves at the table on time to try to work your way out if something goes sideways?   50:51 - Eric: At the lease level, have you had tenants with who you have had to work beyond initial contractual terms? The underlying risk is the tenants. How do you deal with tenants in financial distress, and what is a typical approach in your experience? At the end of the day, these assets are only valuable if you have tenants that want the space and want to pay rent and can pay rent.   54:07 - Eric: What percentage of your tenants have issues where they are not making their total payments, and you have to deal with that in some way?   56:45 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the poll, there are four days left, and it was quite tight between the yes and the abstain. Unless you managed to really piss off well one of the delegates that are here tonight everything should go according to your plan.   57:37 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Ben, Joe, and Wenzel, what is the best way of reaching you?    Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 58:21  Thank you to everyone for coming. It was great having you. Have a nice one!   Credits   @Gala produced this summary. Kunfu-po produced this summary.
