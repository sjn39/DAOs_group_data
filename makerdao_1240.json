                    "content": " Motivation This Signal Request is inspired by a conversation on the MakerDAO Discord Channel, and community member @makercaesar who ask what is the current state of the AAVE Direct Deposit DAI Module. We believe it is important to ask what are the Current Risks of continuing to be exposed to another platform?  (100M at Risk for 1.4M in Revenue)  Overview The current market environment is too volatile and it is separating the stronger lending protocols everywhere, centralized or not, from those who have lower risk standards. Unfortunately AAVE is loaded with risk right now with a large exposure to stETH. AAVE also has a large surface area due to cross-collateralization (unlike Maker) where the locked collateral like ETH and WBTC in the protocol can be taken out by other borrowers. It also operates on multiple chains which means that is carries exposure to centralized bridge failure risk on all those chains as well. It\u2019s a risky environment in general to extend a 100M Debt Ceiling when the dominant theme is redemption. The AAVE-DAI pool currently has enough reserves right now for MakerDAO to withdraw. If the DAI reserves become empty, any periodic DAI repayments from other borrowers will be snatched quickly by bots and a protocol like MakerDAO will be locked-in for a long time. Similar to how Central Banks increase or decrease Money Supply, the D3M was originally meant to supply liquidity on a short term basis,  and MakerDAO can risk locking its liquidity up for a long time. It\u2019s a small percentage of total MakerDAO TVL, but the amount is large enough to cause issues to the surplus buffer.  PROS  Risk Profile is now higher (100M at Risk) and these new factors should be discussed. The Stability Fee rate in Maker and AAVE are already at parity which means we do not need this D3M to operate right now, so it can be turned off without causing any issues. MKR token owners, community members, and Delegates should gather data and analysis from folks who are monitoring various data points on this thread so that MakerDAO can make an informed choice.   CONS  Decrease in DAI deposits via the AAVE D3M Decrease in D3M will hamper 1,000,000++ DAI income to Maker( Source )     SET The AAVE D3M DC Temporarily to 0 (Zero)  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Poll Closes on 20/06/2022 at 17:00 UTC ",

Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong but the main Aave Ethereum market has not been migrated to your new V3 codebase, which means governance does not have the ability to set debt ceilings for any collateral types? Whether it is under your control or not, Aave governance has let stETH become the largest collateral type on the platform. The recommendations from your risk team to handle this issue seemed to have spooked some of your own users already.  In a protocol like Aave where bad debt effects all pools/users I\u2019ve been surprised and extremely disappointed to watch this play out. As systemic risk builds you continue to loosen stEth\u2019s risk parameters. It seems Aave has managed to recreate the system of socialized bailouts - increasing risk for all users to try to protect a few whales. Because of this around a week ago I closed all my positions from Aave for the time being. I am a hard NACK on changing anything at this point - I already think you\u2019ve made multiple missteps and this is just another bad decision trying to play puppeteer.  link to comment: Staked ETH and AAVE Risk (June 11th Update) - #6 by bred - Liquidation - Aave Key point here is \u201cfor the time being\u201d.

We are talking about a possibly existential risk to Maker for nominal revenue. We just cleared a considerable amount of liquidations as income this month. This possibly existential risk is in addition to the reputational risk to MakerDAO from which recovery would be unlikely. Look at the current MKR price, it is already irrational based on solid past performance of Maker. What would happen with some bad PR and sentiment? The best thing we have going for us right now is our value as a solid, conservative, and reliable protocol. It would behoove us to take steps to protect this market position. From the MKR holder perspective the risk/reward brings concerns. It is very easy to turn the D3M back on if conditions make it desirable ( a simple signal request), it is near impossible to clean up a mess or put back any damage once done.

I think it\u2019s worth considering just quite how much needs to go wrong in order for Maker to be negatively affected here.  stETH price needs to break down to the point where liquidations start to happen. Liquidations need to happen at a rate that results in Aave taking bad debt. Aave needs to be unable to cover all of that bad debt out of its surplus. Aave needs to be unable to cover all of that bad debt using their Safety Module. The market needs to lose confidence in Aave to prompt a bank run. Aave needs to be unable to convince some VC/Whales to provide a bailout. MakerDAO needs to write-off the remaining bad debt from Aave \u2190 FIRST POINT MAKER PROTOCOL TAKES LOSSES The MakerDAO surplus buffer needs to not be able to cover the bad debt. MakerDAO needs to be unable to recover sufficient DAI using the flop mechanism to balance the bad debt. \u2190 FIRST POINT MKR HOLDERS TAKE REALIZED LOSSES The market needs to lose confidence in MakerDAO to prompt a bank run. MakerDAO needs to be unable to convince some VC/Whales to provide a bailout. \u2190 POINT MAKER COLLAPSES  Secondly, it\u2019s worth considering how much value is actually at risk in Aave due to the stETH thing, and how much bad debt can be absorbed by the existing layers of defence in both Aave and Maker.  There are 450M dollars worth of ETH borrowed. Some percentage of that ETH is not collateralized by staked ETH. stETH is not going to significantly and durably break from ETH price absent an issue with Lido. Say Aave ends up with bad debt equal to 33% of 450M - that\u2019s 150M (and is frankly a large overestimate) Aave had 40M of non-AAVE reserves in March (presumably more by now) Aave have ~100M of AAVE reserves. The Aave Safety Module has 120M of AAVE reserves. (note only 30% of this can be used for one event) The Aave-Balancer Safety Module has 86M of liquidity tokens as a reserve. (note only 30% of this can be used for one event) The Aave market cap is 835M. MakerDAO has 82M of surplus buffer. Maker has market cap of 760M.  Numbers are rounded judiciously, but you get the point. Layers of defence are how we reduce the risk of problems affecting us significantly to negligible values. We do this in Maker as well (over-collateralization, liquidation penalty, surplus buffer, MKR market cap, etc etc). (View my own, not GovAlpha\u2019s) ",

                    "content": "After today\u2019s proposal by Gauntlet our team believes Maker should disable D3M for the time being. The proposed 90% liquidation threshold is a risky move, even though there\u2019s some rationale behind the proposal. The reason we believe this is risky is because out of 200m DAI borrowed on Aave Ethereum v2, 100m DAI is being borrowed by Celsius and collateralized mostly by stETH. Although the 90% liquidation threshold can have some benefits against stETH/ETH depeg, it presents a high risk for users borrowing stablecoins collateralized by stETH, especially when knowing Celsius is under stress right now.  1600\u00d7732 177 KB  This Aave governance proposal hasn\u2019t passed yet and there is a possibility that it won\u2019t since part of the community objected to the proposal. That said, we believe that Maker should proceed with caution in this case, especially now when already the low revenue (1.40% APY) from this exposure doesn\u2019t offset the potential tail risks. Depending on the developments in coming weeks, @Risk-Core-Unit will present their view on the situation at the next MOMC meeting in about 2 weeks (and potentially suggesting to enable D3M back on). We therefore propose to disable Aave D3M (set DC to 0 and bar to 79%) in the executive vote tomorrow. ",

While I tend to be more conservative than most on more issues I have long advocated Maker taking on some risk when this is balanced against the SB eating losses. Why DC 0 here vs. going to something like 50-100M? You talk about disabling D3M but you don\u2019t give a real risk analysis of how much Maker could lose with various DCs and event situations?   This is one thing I find lacking from Risk generally is a graduated approach to risk reports.    Like given a DC level and a list of risk situations what is the loss hazard. Now it might be better to put these decisions in a larger global context (i.e maybe Maker is better suited to focusing on bonds and RWA). and or whether this decision has implications for other D3Ms (Compound). My point is can we get from Risk CU some better grain and quality on these decisions so governance can make a real risk, reward judgement here vs. a binary we suggest this, yes/no. Thank you in advance. ",

Is this concern about stETH/ETH ratio or just an ETH price in general that the stETH/ETH price may move too fast for the buffer between stETH/ETH to be able to liquidate and contain losses? I guess given the market at this time prudence would say just get out of the way here, especially if DAI borrowing rates are not attractive.  Personally I would think if the markets thought there was an issue DAI rates would climb pretty dramatically on AAVE in response to this hazard (people would be pulling DAI like Maker Risk is suggesting).

Aave accepts Chainlink data with no sanity check or circuit breaker of any sort. If Chainlink sends bad price data for any asset, or if Chainlink\u2019s 4-of-9 multisig is otherwise compromised, all lending positions on Aave would immediately find themselves incorrectly liquidated.
