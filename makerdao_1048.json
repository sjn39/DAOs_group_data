What is a Trust Indenture Our work is complete and we are aligned on the cornerstone agreement to enable on-boarding at scale of RWAs via the Centrifuge protocol. The Trust Indenture Agreement is that cornerstone agreement. Centrifuge - Form of Trust Indenture @elidco and @christiancdpetersen will hold an AMA to provide an overview of the key components of the Indenture Trust Agreement in the coming weeks. Our joint thanks to everyone in the Maker community that provided feedback, supported this process, and/or demanded results. The collaboration will generate a positive outcome for RWAs in the Maker ecosystem! @Real-World-Finance @luca_pro @elidco @spin @martin @roollie @ctcunning ",
