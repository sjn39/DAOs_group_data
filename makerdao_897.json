In order for the automation features to be trustless and verifiable on-chain, Oasis.app is requesting whitelist access to the following OSMs listed below to allow its automation smart contracts to read the current and next price of the relevant Oracles.  Oracle Names  ETH/USD WSTETH/USD WBTC/USD RENBTC/USD YFI/USD UNI/USD LINK/USD MANA/USD   Customer(s) Oasis.app - [email\u00a0protected]  Whitelist Oasis.app - 0x55Dc2Be8020bCa72E58e665dC931E03B749ea5E0 - OSM   Requirements For each customer address to be whitelisted: - Is the contract source code verified on Etherscan? yes - Is the Oracle data used in a permissioned manner that would prevent parasitic behavior? yes - Is Oracle data written to storage? no - If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? n/a - If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? n/a  Fee In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees are waived for the first year and determined by MKR Governance after that.  Changelog 8-Apr-2022 - Split BTC/USD Oracle into both WBTC and RENBTC for clarity ",
