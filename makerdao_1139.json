But I also think I heard in Discord or @rune\u2019s calls or community call that most delegates are just part time. Does anyone know if this is true? I think someone said @flipflopflapdelegate and @GFXlabs and maybe another couple are full time and the others all just do it as a hobby or part time gig? Can the various delegates maybe chime in so we know which are working on Maker every day and which are just focused on knowing a few aspects? If not full time, which parts of the DAO do you try to be \u201cexpert\u201d on? For simplicity, let\u2019s call an average of 40 hours a week full time. Big thanks in advance. I think it would help small holders know who to delegate to. Also, it would be helpful to know what to think about the pretty high level of pay. ",

Wouldn\u2019t call myself an expert on something (most Germans would be hesitant to confess\u2026), but I guess I do have some good knowledge on the core protocol and  since I am coming with a computer science background I guess I am one of the few people who are actually reviewing the weekly spells before voting  So I would say the protocol itself and its various knobs to turn (parameters, stability fees\u2026) are my main interest while stuff like RWA is totally out of my domain.

We are a full-time Governance team focused on many L1s (Ethereum, Terra, Solana, Osmosis) and DAOs - concurrently beginning to expand into L2s. Maker is very time-intensive and is difficult to balance with other responsibilities. We believe in the merit of being involved in the governance of other DAOs and building valuable cross-network knowledge. We commit one full-time hire to focus on MakerDAO as a key responsibility for about 20 hours a week. As a Data Analytics organization and Governance team, we focus on decentralization, growth strategy, DAO infrastructure & tooling, and making Maker more accessible for all. We also view Maker as a luminary that can be shared as a model for other growing DAOs. Feel free to reach out for more! ",

Many including myself and @PaperImperium also work on educating various players (such as traditional finance and government officers) and promoting Dai and MakerDAO in several ways. Though to be honest, so far I never felt it like a job but more of a movement and a duty. In 10 years, we will be remembered. But in what way? As an interesting experiment that failed?

I think its important to list the reasoning behind the votes, which I see people do.

We are in the process of converting to a decentralized, community-owned services DAO (we call our flavor of DAO a \u201csatellite DAO\u201d). I work full-time 24/7 300% in Web3 as the founder of ACREinvest and co-founder of a tokenized community we sponsor called ACRE DAOs. ACRE DAOs is in the social DAO space comprised of folks interested in regenerative finance (ReFi) and how DAOs can use crypto asset investing and permissionless peer-to-peer markets for positive change in the real world. Being compensated as a Recognized Delegate is not a \u201cjob.\u201d My personal time spent is an investment as an entrepreneur in a business proof-of-concept around a new industry of crypto governance services. A successful business model for the provision of such services will need to be found for any DeFi protocol or other DAO with significant Treasury resources to function productively and soundly at scale. My activities in the space are accordingly integrated and chosen strategically so that by cross-pollination and aligned contributions, ACREinvest can add meaningful value within all the ecosystems where I am active. Bringing \u201creal world\u201d Wall Street credentials and decades of experience as a New York admitted attorney - summary here, the compensation paid by the protocol is in no way comparable to my individual opportunity cost for what I would charge for legal services or salaries I could command in the private sector. Allocation of my time that is task-oriented for MakerDAO is dynamic and dependent on what\u2019s needed to meet the minimum level of obligation for the Recognized Delegate role, plus whatever additional time makes sense in the grand big world of opportunity and long term impact I\u2019d like to contribute to the project. Generally speaking, there are not the financial incentives currently in place to support the level of full-time engagement and subject matter expertise the DAO needs urgently today and in the future for governance and accountable C-suite type leadership. In terms of leadership, we have to radically re-think what accountable leadership looks like in a decentralized organization. I just did a Tweet storm sharing some resources and thoughts on this point.  twitter.com    kianga.eth \ud83c\udf0d 1000 ACRE DAOs in 1000 Days @fhomoney  Who (i.e., what kind of actor) is in the best position of trust to be responsible for understanding everything that\u2019s happening & capable to communicate the information legibly to the various stakeholders in the@MakerDAO ecosystem (not just MKR holders)? forum.makerdao.com/t/acreinvest-d\u2026   12:54 PM - 27 May 2022       Hope that\u2019s helpful to the discussion here in this thread! Thanks for the opportunity. ",
