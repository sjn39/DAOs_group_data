Motivation Working on the Risk side of things at MakerDAO together with Cyrus and the team now for one and half years, I believe I have a very good overview of the challenges in front of the Risk Domain. My main focus going forward would be:  Maximize Protocol self-sustainability and robustness Scale Risk Teams:  Build a independent structure of Risk analysts responsible directly to MakerDAO and compensated by the Protocol Onboard additional regular contributors through mentoring and tasks Make contributors specialize in Risk Domain fields i.e. monetary policy, peg & liquidity, collateral risk assessments, RWA, etc.   More agile and effective collateral onboarding, focus on RWA Simplify Rate and Debt Ceiling setting process that enables collateral type scaling Enhance monitoring tools for Portfolio risk and DAI/Vault related metrics Address and monitor systemic DeFi risks  Work Credentials Work Experience:  MakerDAO Risk related work since March 2019 Development of General Model for risk premium and debt ceiling SCD dashboards Past relevant analyses:  Collateral risk assessments Various analyses on Vault metrics and behaviour SCD to MCD migration Auctions & Liquidations DAI liquidity analysis Maker Capital evaluations for solvency Other MakerDAO / DeFi related Research   Certified FRM by GARP Distressed Debt Senior Analyst at Elements Capital Risk & Asset Manager at Alpen Invest  Relevant Information   Rocket Chat Account: @doopson   Github Account: @doopson   MakerDAO Forum Account: @Primoz   Twitter Account: PrimozKordez   ",

However, in this case, I think this should move to Formal Submission and be included in the September governance cycle. The reasons for this are as follows:  We essentially don\u2019t have a Risk domain team currently due to Cyrus departing the Foundation. Primoz is covering Cyrus\u2019s responsibilities already, given this is the case, it makes sense to confirm that MKR Holders are happy with this state of affairs as soon as possible. The emergency action process for risk is awkward currently given Primoz hasn\u2019t been ratified. We need to fix this asap.  ",
