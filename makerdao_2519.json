The debate was centered around whether the peg ($1.033 on Coinbase as of poll creation) required emergency intervention, or whether it will organically decrease with the unwinding of YFI mining (estimated to be completed Saturday ~1030 UTC) This poll will help signal whether to expedite the ongoing signal request to adjust USDC-A vault parameters.  Should the community take emergency action?     Take emergency action by adjusting USDC-A parameters No emergency action at this time Abstain     0 voters     Notes:  The poll will run for 24 hours or until the Risk Team intervenes  @LongForWisdom mentioned that a winning option would require > 50% of the vote  ",

Please consider the following points as you vote:  This poll won\u2019t complete until after 16:00 UTC, meaning that the result here will miss the regular Friday executive. Even if a collateralization ratio change was included in the Friday executive, I think it\u2019s unlikely it would be implemented and have much of an affect before Saturday 10:30 UTC We are struggling to reach consensus in the other thread on a particular CR, this makes me worry about bundling this with other changes in an executive. We are struggling to reach consensus on this thread as well, with many choosing to abstain. The monthly MIPs executive is scheduled for Monday and seems to have general support. Having multiple executives active at once is not great in terms of system security.  Even if the community does want to expedite the collateralisation ratio change on USDC-A, it may still need to happen next week and it\u2019s going to be awkward to fit in with the regular governance stuff, and I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to skip or postpone the regularly scheduled governance votes (ie the MIPs exec).

USDC vaults are still being opened and the risk parameters do not seem to be a big detriment to their use. The amount of USDC available is also not enough to restore the peg. In a world where a new DeFi token is introduced and consumes $125m DAI liquidity in 5 days, the market just flat out needs higher debt ceilings of scaleable collateral assets to adjust. Literally 99% of DAI liquidity is being used for DeFi projects right now, and the true demand side there likely goes many multiples higher than what we are providing. I know we want diversity in collateral assets, but ETH is the only thing we have available now that scales up to these numbers. ",
