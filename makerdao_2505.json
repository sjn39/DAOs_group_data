Maker Token Holders have expressed an intention to compensate vault holders, but a sufficiently specific and agreeable plan has not yet emerged. The Vault Compensation Plan Proposal, a community effort which described a multi-stage process to determine compensation and the means to deliver it, was not approved by Maker Token Holders. Meanwhile, many are dissatisfied with the length of the process and uncertainty of the results. To help ensure that Maker Token Holders, who can vote to enact a compensation plan, and affected Vault Owners are on the same page, I ask that you reply and share exactly what you consider to be the fair level of compensation for your affected vault, and how you arrive at that amount. I believe that if we can identify this value for each vault, Maker Token Holders are very likely to return the shortfall to affected Vault Owners. In an efficient liquidation auction, what would have been the dollar value of your remaining collateral after the auction completed? ",

Returning 100% of the collateral the vault had at time of liquidation would mean 100% debt forgiveness.   The protocol charges a 13% liquidation penalty, which you have not accounted for.   Even in an smoothly running, efficient auction, participants bid to make a profit, so one should expect bids to be less than full value.   It seems to me that in a well running and efficient liquidation auction, your vault could not possibly have been left with all of the collateral it had before the liquidation. ",

I will point out that the vault owner by deciding how much collateral to deposit and ultimately how much DAI to borrow that set their liquidation value directly. For ETH given Liquidation Fee of 13% and Liquidation Ratio of 150% the nominal collateral return runs about 24.8% unless a keeper overbids (which does happen from time to time). So only under the best circumstance could one hope to get back approximately 25% of the collateral simply because when the price went against you and you got liquidated the value of your collateral + 13% liquidation fee was 75% of your total equity value.    When markets are dropping the OSM will be higher than the real market value, only if markets are rising would the OSM be low and if a vault was in the process of liquidation might it fetch more value. One thing I posted about is that if markets are not dropping that fast or lets say a the OSM just reduces the CR below the LR IF the liquidation system could auction off the collateral in a vault sequentially IF any collateral is returned this would improve the remaining CR so that the rest of the collateral would not need to be auctioned.    I posted about this elsewhere as an idea to reduce liquidations but would only have allowed more time for the auctions to be stopped and many vaults to have some collateral saved vs. peeling off what happened at 0-bid.     A Liquidation System Redesign: A Pre-MIP Discussion Proposal Ideas       Folks a quick note regarding an some thoughts on the liquidation system that led to an idea.  A quick example that illustrates the idea:  Lets say OSM is at $200USD/ETH (just for easy calculation) and a new vault owner opens with 300ETH a vault for 20K DAI.   So their CR on inception is 300%.   All fine and dandy.   Now OSM drops to $100 putting them at the liquidation point.  So now they come under liquidation gun here.   The system as it is currently designed liquidates everything returning an\u2026     I want to remind vault owners that the network was under a mempool attack at the time as commented on here.    blog.blocknative.com    Evidence of Mempool Manipulation on Black Thursday: Hammerbots, Mempool... Explore findings from Blocknative's Mempool Archive that shed light on the CDP Liquidations of March 12 and 13. Learn about vulnerabilities that every crypto company should plan for.      And that finally out of the total liquidations (off top of my head something like 13M DAI) Maker system ate 5.3M of losses.   So it isn\u2019t just vault owners that lost out but MKR holders as well.   In a more centralized system this probably would have been dealt with sooner, but in this pretty inefficient and slow decentralized one it is dragging on. Every time I see ETH climbing I cringe thinking of everyone here and how Maker still has to improve not at liquidating but at reducing liquidations because I don\u2019t feel massively safe here except in the USDC facility with liquidations turned off or at CRs so high as to not be immensely useful against the pricing risk and network tx risk we saw not just in Black Thursday but variations of this going on today driving up Ethereum network tx costs to as high as Black Thursday.   twitter.com    Philippe Castonguay (PhABCD)  Turns out the numbers are concerning.
