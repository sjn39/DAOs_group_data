In that period, we created the following tutorial series for Tron which is still the most popular educational source for Tron developers on YouTube with a like/dislike rate of around 96%.

At the end of this project we expect at least 75K-80K unique targeted developer audience. From which at least 4000-6000 (5%-7%) will be regular Optimism content viewers and developers.    Where are you drawing these statistics? Are you able to share with us your average viewership? What is the average conversion rate to subscribers on a weekly or monthly basis? From what I\u2019m seeing on the youtube channel, it\u2019s 6.27k subscribers, less than projected target amount. Granted, other non-subscribers can account for the conversion, but if we look at the previous two complete projects you\u2019ve posted (Optimism NFT Tutorial and Polygon NFT Tutorial), there is a decreasing amount of views per video. Optimism NFT Tutorial: Tutorial 1 had the most views with 1.5k, Tutorial 2 had 190 views. This continues to decrease with videos at 62 views, 49 views, 38 views, 41 views, and 39 views respectively. Lower amounts than the initial post. Even if we assumed these were all unique individuals, it only totals to a little over 1.9k viewers. Polygon NFT Tutorial: Polygon Tutorials experience a similar drop off, Tutorial 1 has 6.3k views, Tutorial 2 has 2.4k, then 557 views, 280 views, 142 views, 130 views, 118 views, 128 views. Again assuming unique individuals, this totals 10k views. What is the viewership timeline? Given its been 3 weeks since the Optimism NFT Tutorials, do you see most viewers closer to publication or is it a week or so after? Polygon NFT Tutorials have been available for 2 months. \u2013Now maybe the NFT Tutorial Series is not too big right now because it\u2019s new and hasn\u2019t paid its dividends yet. Maybe the dApp videos will perform better.\u2013 Ethereum dApp Tutorial: Comparing to the Ethereum tutorials for expected reference, these videos experience the same drop off. Tutorial 1 has 16k views, Tutorial 2 has 4.3k views, then a slight uptick to 5k views for Tutorial 3, then 2.7k views, 1.4k views, and 1.6k views. The videos total ~31,000 views, accumulated over 2 years ago. \u2013Now here, let\u2019s assume \"okay, we didn\u2019t market this, let\u2019s use the channel\u2019s best playlist \u201cBest Tron (TRX) DApp Tutorial Series for Beginners\u201d\u2013 Tron dApp Tutorial Series: This playlist has 19,135 views. It experiences the same drop off from 33k views and levels around 2.0k - 4k views later. If I assumed all unique users, again, the total is 78,100 views. This accumulated from the past 4 years posted. It is only now reaching its mark of the Optimism\u2019s proposed 75k-80k views, and you received Tron partnership to perform the same services, correct? Questions: I think to sum up, can we get more information on the viewing activity for videos? What do you plan to use for strategies for marketing and PR campaigns? Suggestions: You may want to decrease the amount of videos posted per focus because of the decline in viewership. This may decrease the fund proposal request as well and could make the project more feasible. I hope this post isn\u2019t too much information, just trying to justify my reasoning and thinking. Looking forward to your response. ",

                    "content": "Hi, Thanks for the comments. Let me answer your questions one by one. Where are you drawing these statistics? Are you able to share with us your average viewership? What is the average conversion rate to subscribers on a weekly or monthly basis? This is the average statistics for any YouTube video series. Around 5-7% of the viewers tend to stick to the content. Also, regular content viewers doesn\u2019t mean they have subscribed to the channel. Content viewers and subscribers are two different things. From what I\u2019m seeing on the youtube channel, it\u2019s 6.27k subscribers, less than projected target amount. Granted, other non-subscribers can account for the conversion, but if we look at the previous two complete projects you\u2019ve posted (Optimism NFT Tutorial and Polygon NFT Tutorial), there is a decreasing amount of views per video. Sure, viewers will decrease with each advanced video. We only advertise first 2 videos of the series and all other views are organic. That means people who got engaged through advertising watch them as they get time. Just last week we worked with Flow team for tutorial series (link here : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5pYVd8AWtStx6jrAKKgJPjEznpqYbJh ) and you can see that there are around 1K viewers who have completed the course and the number will increase within next 2-3 weeks. The Optimism NFT Tutorial and Polygon NFT Tutorial has not been advertised through, hence there are low views. (please go through the milestones where we have mentioned PR campaign for the same.) What is the viewership timeline? Given its been 3 weeks since the Optimism NFT Tutorials, do you see most viewers closer to publication or is it a week or so after? Polygon NFT Tutorials have been available for 2 months. Please go though the milestones : Series will be advertised through various sources to get at least 25K-30K unique viewers. Budget will be spent for a 1 month long period. Expected 25K-30K total views. (Around 1K viewers/day) Again Polygon NFT tutorials have not been advertised. We have just entered into partnership with Polygon and will start working with them from next month. Please look at Flow tutorials, as we are currently actively working with them. Tron dApp Tutorial Series: This playlist has 19,135 views. It experiences the same drop off from 33k views and levels around 2.0k - 4k views later. If I assumed all unique users, again, the total is 78,100 views. This accumulated from the past 4 years posted. It is only now reaching its mark of the Optimism\u2019s proposed 75k-80k views, and you received Tron partnership to perform the same services, correct? No. The terms were different at that time. We didn\u2019t advertise the Tron videos. All views are completely organic. You can see by searching that our videos show up at the top of the search on YouTube as well as Google. Flow tutorials terms are same as Optimism. So please choose Flow tutorials as a basis to compare. You can see that we developed tutorial series as well as developed Tron based android game with them. (link here : https://www.candycrunchdapp.com/) I think to sum up, can we get more information on the viewing activity for videos? What do you plan to use for strategies for marketing and PR campaigns? We use Google, Facebook ads as well as we have collaborations with other YouTubers, who will promote the video. You may want to decrease the amount of videos posted per focus because of the decline in viewership. This may decrease the fund proposal request as well and could make the project more feasible. As you can see, our channel has all of the videos of length around 8-12 mins and all of the series have around 8-12 videos. Our viewers are accustomed to it and it would be good if we keep the same format throughout. I hope I have answered all your questions. Please feel free to ask more if you need more information. Thanks!  ",

Budget will be spent for a 1 month long period. Expected 25K-30K total views. (Around 1K viewers/day) Although it is stated as around 1K viewers/day for 30 days, which counts 30K views in total, we might get views faster than expected. For eg. 2K viewers/day for 15 days. In case of Flow tutorial series, we got around 20K views in around 10 days, which counts for 2K viewers/day. We are still getting views but now with slower rate. We expect to get around 30-35K views till March end for the series, which is actually more than expected. In short it is a bit flexible and depends upon response from viewers, although I can assure you that series will get more views than given in the proposal. But for the sake for conservative estimate, I have given 25K-30K views per tutorial series. Also, once you get around 30K views, the tutorial series will be listed at the top of the YouTube search results. Hence it will keep getting organic views as days pass by. You can search with \u2018flow nft tutorial\u2019 or \u2018flow dapp tutorial\u2019 or \u2018flow nft dapp\u2019 or \u2018flow nft dapp tutorial\u2019 or similar phrases and you will see that now our tutorial series has been at the top of the search results (Or at least in the first 5 results depends upon the region and user YouTube history). I hope I have answered your question. Thanks! Let me know if you need more clarification.  ",
