It is our view that we are in a nascent stage of crypto, and controlling as much future market share as possible is critical for the survival of this project. Our focus is on practical solutions to achieve the objectives listed below as quickly as possible. Perfection is the enemy of progress. We aim to find solutions that work first and backfill decentralization / resilience later.  Short Term Objectives  Capital raise to solve cash flow problems and increase surplus buffer to improve risk tolerance. This may be done through a combination of equity and debt instruments. Multi-chain expansion to grow our user base with a focus on meeting retail users where they are/going to be. This includes boosting DAI liquidity on as many chains as possible. Positioning Maker as a credit wholesaler from which third parties can get access to durable, affordable credit. Start earning interest on the stablecoin supply with short-term treasuries and other low-risk strategies. A focus on enabling the DAO to hire and retain talent via initiatives such as conference and hackathon sponsorships.   Long Term Objectives  Grow the interest-bearing DAI supply such that we can re-activate the Dai Savings Rate. Marketing DAI as the sustainable stablecoin that gives you an implicit savings rate. Fly-wheel growth via higher DSR \u2192 More DAI Demand \u2192 More Capacity for Loans \u2192 Sustain the DSR.   Anticipated Spends: Fundraising Roadshow & Promotion  Conference sponsorship to get speaker access. This will allow us to deliver keynotes, guide hackathons, etc. This will help us both on the hiring as well as the partnership front. DAO-wide offsite in late summer with training sessions from core units, talks, activities in an effort to align the DAO on long term objectives. This will foster trust and community within the DAO. Hire a lawyer to review possible capital raise structures Any other ad-hoc expense that is useful and cannot be covered by the scope of individual core units.  Please note the associated fund is a request for delegated authority to spend in a discretionary way to help meet the objectives of the Task Force. It\u2019s entirely possible this fund goes unused, but it is our preference to have it available and not use it rather than being unable to execute on something due to governance overhead. ",

The idea is to give the teams a bit more autonomy to call the shots for medium-sized spends. We could continue to use the SPF process, but there is a large amount of overhead that comes with that. Also, there is 2 months of uncertainty where we cannot execute on things. In the past this has lead to things like core units pitching parts of their budgets when things need to get done outside of the scope of any particular CU. This is sort of like optimistic SPFs. Give us a little slack and if we totally don\u2019t use the funds in a way the DAO wants never give us another budget again. ",

Maybe we need something like working groups or committees with multi-stakeholder participation, but these should be quite limited, narrowly focused on a single issue and if there\u2019s funding needed then that funding should flow through the appropriate CU budgeting processes.

Often in negotiations we need to have the authority to make agreements and credible threats. We cannot effectively do this if we have no formal mandate to be negotiating on behalf of the DAO. This proposal mostly formalizes this, such that the DAO says okay go ahead you can come to arrangements with the DAO\u2019s counter-parties and communicate the proposals to the delegates to see if it\u2019s desirable. The current system continues the negotiation phase into the forum where counter-parties are able to get concessions due to the non-uniform stance of the DAO. This is largely to our disadvantage and sometimes means we cannot arrange things at all as sometimes deals span many different aspects. Sometimes MakerDAO may have leverage that the counter-party is unaware of and broadcasting the details of that leverage in a public setting completely defeats the point as they are now aware. This is why we need private negotiations otherwise we just cannot achieve anything of practical use. Working groups also exist, but serve a more narrow purpose as you say and are unelected. This is a bit broader and saves the overhead of having to go to governance for every initiative. For me I\u2019d much rather be spending my time working on delivering MCD on L2, D3Ms, striking deals, etc instead of on the forum. I don\u2019t think this proposal is going too far as there is still the public MIPs process where anything over the top or malicious can be opposed. Does this answer everything? ",

First, what are the broader level initiatives you mention where that off-forum initiative/agency is required (and what is the extent of delegation of power that goes into that from Community to agents). Second, what are the kinds of initiatives that working groups play in. And what is the level of agency they have (if any). If you could map those out, I think it would go a long way in understanding what this proposal is about. Just a suggestion. ",

This is completely hypothetical, but for the Institutional Vaults working group we may be presented with scenarios where the counter-party is wanting a certain rate that is too good for them and not good enough for us. We are left with the decisions, do we say take it or leave it? Present the options to the DAO? etc. It\u2019s entirely possible there is private information that allows us to know they will for sure take a certain rate. How do we present this in public? Again this is hypothetical, but there are similar situations. So far these sort of decisions are in a murky grey area where we are just making ad-hoc decisions on what is governance\u2019s domain and what is the unelected working group\u2019s domain. I would like to formalize this with a mandate as per this proposal. I understand there are a few things muddled together here. Writing well thought out proposals is not my strong suit nor my interest. I see SES coming up with a much more robust long term proposal with political parties or Rune\u2019s MetaDAO thing. I\u2019ll leave it to them to figure that out and have no problem switching over when they are ready. To me this is just knocking down some barriers, so we can execute and deliver the objectives listed above to the DAO as fast as possible. I will stress again that this doesn\u2019t really formally change much beyond reducing a 3 week freeze period to 1 week and some discretionary funds for ad-hoc expenses. Also, if people don\u2019t like the money part it\u2019s not the most important thing. Feel free to pick the option where we form a Task Force, but don\u2019t get funds. ",

If we need flexibility in the mandates to allow for work across core units, let\u2019s talk about that.  But why do we need extra funds to do that?  Are people getting paid more to work functions that aren\u2019t specific to their CU?  Do you get extra money on top of what you are being paid for being part of a working group?  That would essentially equate to asking for a raise.  I think that\u2019s the part that isn\u2019t going over too well\u2026especially in a down market where DAI demand is down and MKR recurring revenue is slowly going down.  The margins are much thinner and there\u2019s much less money to fling around.  Maybe one way to better present this request is to somehow exclude use of funds for personal benefit of participating members. MKR has performed very well but it doesn\u2019t seem like the time to start spending more.  If anything, the downfall of terra gives the protocol more time to figure things out and get things right.  Going down the path toward unprofitability takes that luxury away and puts us in a more precarious position. What we really want is to be able to trust that CU members are not working for their own benefit more than the protocol\u2019s benefit.  That they can work harder and smarter without continuing to ask for more so that we can all benefit together rather than feeling like we\u2019re all competing for a piece of the pie. ",

Since we cannot \u201csee\u201d what work is being performed that adds value to the protocol, maybe a better way of coordinating would be to use something like coordinape. MKR holders vote on the number of points allocated to each recognized delegate. The delegate gives these points to contributors of the protocol, but cannot reward themselves. Points are redeemed for DAI. This system puts delegates in charge of paying other contributors for their proof of (off-chain) work while developing (on-chain) reputation. If a delegate stops accruing points or is accruing way too many, then they can have their role revoked and a new member added as a recognized delegate. This creates a decentralized workforce with some checks and balances through retroactive funding of labor already performed and trust in fellow Maker contributors. ",

I would like to formalize this with a mandate as per this proposal.   Most of us MKR holders are not in the weeds with the CUs and are underrating how frustrating it is to be making decisions when your authorities are so murky. I personally hate working under a manager who doesn\u2019t clearly delegate, and I can\u2019t imagine working under several hundred MKR holders doing the same. We need to set our CUs up for success by either creating some routes for delegation, or create clarity in the decision making process. Based on the exponentially increasing complexity of Maker\u2019s operations, I think the former is the only option, so I think this proposal is worth exploring. Hexonaut, as you mentioned, I think we should consider the mandate section of this proposal separately from the budget. The goals of the proposal in it\u2019s current state are too miscellaneous to justify a budget, even with detailed post-hoc reporting. Could we focus this proposal to one or two intertwined points from your short term objectives and tie those to some areas of decision making that the task force needs leeway on within those short term objectives? I think this would remove some of the items folks find objectionable and/or help us find another solution to the more precise problem. I\u2019d be happy to brainstorm or contribute to drafting something if I can help. To me #1 and #3 seem the most intertwined and possibly require the most discretionary decisionmaking. ",

So, I do understand why other here on this thread are concern and feel like a $1M ask is unjustified, when Core Units have their own budgets and folks like myself and others are compensated via the Surplus Buffer. You couple that with the current economic environment and I think you and the others in this committee, should understand why this is a tough pill to swallow for many. With that in mind\u2014Let\u2019s do a breakdown of the short-term initiative (after all the community is going to think \u201cshort-term\u201d = fast results)     hexonaut:  Capital raise to solve cash flow problems and increase surplus buffer to improve risk tolerance. This may be done through a combination of equity and debt instruments.   Is it fair to say that meeting with interested parties (folks looking to put capital to work) can be done while attending a conference? I imagine that the majority of the expense will come from hiring firms for Legal work/review. If so, I think early-on your proposal should have stated such. But even then, legal reviews/M&A/deal structuring fees can run somewhere around $150k-$300K. This alone can eat up to 30% of the budget ask. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense to do a SPF (MIP55) assuming MKR token holders approve a capital raise ?     hexonaut:  Multi-chain expansion to grow our user base with a focus on meeting retail users where they are/going to be. This includes boosting DAI liquidity on as many chains as possible.   I imagine the majority of the expense here comes from audits, perhaps outsourcing some of the work to other CU team members (they\u2019ll need to be compensated), etc.\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be clever here to ask some of these chains to incentivize MKR token owners to make such a move? In other words, perhaps asking someone like Polygon to make an investment in the MakerDAO ecosystem? Or, ask them to fund such initiative?(thinking of ways where money can be saved)     hexonaut:  Positioning Maker as a credit wholesaler from which third parties can get access to durable, affordable credit.   Playing devils advocate here\u2014Correct me if I am wrong, but I think this is already part of the mandate for the Growth CU? I imagine their current and the next budget should support initiatives (business development) correlated to positioning Maker as a wholesaler of credit via Maker Vaults? Please expand\u2014perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding.     hexonaut:  Start earning interest on the stablecoin supply with short-term treasuries and other low-risk strategies.   This sounds similar to MIP65, and there\u2019s also MIP72, can you please expand further on how this differs? From the outside looking in, the community might think you\u2019re preaching the same gospel.     hexonaut:  A focus on enabling the DAO to hire and retain talent via initiatives such as conference and hackathon sponsorships.   While I agree that hackathons are super necessary and desperately needed, if you search in this forum for \u201chackathon\u201d \u2014 there have been many budget proposals to do such by teams ranging from the Growth CU, to Data Insights, to the Oracles CU, etc. \u2014 looking from the outside-in, one would think this is already a mandate by many Core Units. Can you please expand on why  this task-force can make hackathons come into fruition more efficiently? Thanks in advance\u2014trying to see the playing field from the community\u2019s point of view.

I think I can answer almost all of them by saying the funds are not necessarily going to be used to achieve those goals. It is a discretionary fund to be used for unexpected opportunities as they arise. Most of the goals are already being worked on and fall under existing CU budgets/mandates as you say. If something is outside any CUs mandate and we think is a good opportunity then we can fall back to the discretionary fund. Cap raise will mostly be debt based at these prices, so I\u2019m not expecting lawyer fees to be too expensive, but it\u2019s useful to get expert opinions. ",

I am curious how a law firm can advise on the capital raise because MakerDAO is not a legal person. Attorneys must have a \u201cclient\u201d to represent. It\u2019s a topic I have discussed with several peers and herein is a difficult reality we face. Who would be the client when attempting to engage counsel for the capital raise? Lawyers also are very mindful of who can rely on their advice. What\u2019s in the best interest of one MKR holder vs another, or a Core Unit or Delegate\u2026 each has a particular situation and set of risks/benefits in any scenario. I\u2019d be extremely caution of any firm claiming they can give overall advice about what the DAO should do. I further suggest before allocating any budget for such legal costs, there first should be a governance vote approving some scope of what the capital raise deal would look like, or several alternatives to evaluate. A lawyer is not going to be able to give any useful advice (even if the client issue is solved) without certain facts specified. It would be imprudent to pay hefty fees advising on various structures before narrowing the high-level scope via community consensus. Overall, I\u2019m still leaning against supporting this. I\u2019d like to see the relevant CU mandates and budget line items amended as needed instead to address the additional flexibility you need to coordinate, and that any budget implications follow the established control process.

I have not focused on the \u201cGrowth Task Force\u201d proposal, so my observations are limited strictly to the question above. Overall, I (through North Lakes Legal) have had mixed results engaging legal counsel. Many firms struggle with who is the \u201cclient\u201d . . . clearly Maker DAO . . . but then who is Maker DAO . . . the Maker token holders . . . who are the Maker token holders . . . you see the issue. After I explain the overall governance structure and explain the facilitating role of the Real World Finance Core Unit, some firms get comfortable. Others do not. This is ignoring attorney-client privilege, attorney-client communications, and professional liability insurance concerns for larger firms. Law firm hours (lawyers bill hourly) can be easily spent and the figures add-up very fast. So, my recommendation would be for there to be general alignment on the proposal and then, only then, consider legal engagement with a very defined scope of work. Lawyers are only happy to investigate each and every issue posed to them. The client is often the reason that bills are large (putting aside billing rates at $1,000+ per hour). I do not know who is the \u201cclient\u201d for the Growth proposal, so I cannot comment on who/what is best to be the \u201cclient\u201d to engage lawyers. Hope this is helpful. ",

To respond to this specifically, I\u2019m not sure the SPF process is suitable for what this proposal intends to achieve. By definition:  A Special Purpose Fund (SPF) is used to fulfil a narrow, specific, or temporary objective  By design, Task Forces have the freedom to make their own business decisions and set their own objectives without needing as much Governance oversight. This wouldn\u2019t be achievable through the current SPF framework as it doesn\u2019t meet the requirements, they are not narrow, specific, or temporary in nature. That said, specific proposals that the Growth Task Force wanted to submit to MKR holders may be suitable for the SPF framework, in isolation.  E.g. an SPF to get a legal opinion on a specific action as part of an overall growth strategy. ",

This \u201cTask Force\u201d is presented as a way to foster core unit communication, but in practice is just the opposite. Contrary to fostering inclusion, this is an exclusionary group that has already been meeting privately and outside of the greater body of Facilitators and Mandated Actors. A vote in favor of this MIP is a tacit approval and condonement of this behavior. As a self-selected group that is in alignment this group could more appropriately be considered the DAO\u2019s first political party. There is nothing in the existing mandates that prevents these participants from coordinating, however, they expect to \u201cmove fast\u201d by sidestepping calls for stability and security from parties not represented here. I would entreat the DAO to encourage all core units to work together, and while we can\u2019t prevent participants from aligning on shared goals, we should not officially recognize these parties at the DAO level.

Doo_StableLab:  It\u2019s true that the industry moves fast but then considering this involves 1 million Dai transfer, there should be very fine details similar to the level when CU asks for budget increases. Because once transferred, the Task force will use it with their own decisions and won\u2019t ask the community for feedback. In other words, there will be less accountability and transparency compared to the existing model.   ",

Aside from that, the DAO should never be entrusting such large amounts of funding to a multisig without any real oversight. For these reasons, I plan to vote against. P.S. I do like the idea of an in-person offsite for productivity purposes. However, I don\u2019t think that this is the right context for planning it. ",

I think is very cool to see lot of people from many Core Units joining forces to bootstrap even more the MakerDAO protocol. From my point of view, the only push Maker needs since a long time is to be on other chains, but for this need to improve Governance and Oracles (I think??), cuz you forgot one of the biggest crowds in DeFi which are the retail people. Maybe also by reactivating the DSR Maker could be great again among lot of users. Now, following @ChrisBlec concerns, I think this are moments to start thinking of growth, while everyone is on the floor Maker is still a Money Maker Machine, would be very smart to thing on bootstrap our actual tools, and develop many more, but as you say, don\u2019t feel confortable with the speaker access thing or giving so many power without a trully transparence from this group. I\u2019m up for the growth of the protocol, but with more transparency and a future little more clear. ",
