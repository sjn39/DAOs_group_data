                    "content": "We are going to host Ethereum Magicians Virtual Summer Sessions - an amazing virtual event scheduled for July 29, 2020.  The gathering will feature moderated Zoom calls for discussing EIPs and coordinating, and a game-like social experience for the \u201centrance hall\u201d\u2026 where you can voice-chat with others based on proximity. A key feature of the conference software that we\u2019re using will enable us to place \u201cposters\u201d describing a paper or EIP around the entrance hall. We will be able to gather around the entrance hall. We will be able to gather around a topic and discuss it in small groups, similar to what we might do in hallways outside of talks. Join this event to get to know about latest updates that following groups have, get answers to questions about how those groups started, their progress and ask questions.
