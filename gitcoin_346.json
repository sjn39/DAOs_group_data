                    "content": "Grandiose is a Gitcoin grant discovery and exploration tool, aiding users in their quest to find and donate to grants and give an insight to what is present in the grants ecosystem. This is done by experimenting with novel ways to gamify the search for new grants. The app can be found over at https://grandiose.app. The project\u2019s focus is currently on delivering a minimal viable product. The following features are currently live:  An overview of all grants (using a test subset at the moment) A like / dislike matching algorithm Leaderboards Grant of the Day Some cute KPIs / stats  Core features that are not yet done but are considered a requirement for the MVP:  Shopping cart with support for zkSync. There\u2019s no use in using Grandiose if you still have to leave the app and go to the Gitcoin website where you manually have to find your grants again. Collections. A great feature present in the current version of Gitcoin. People want to share what they like. Flash grants. Yeeted the idea from the flash deals you can find in some online game stores. You get shown 4 different grants, and every 6 hours one of the 4 grants gets (randomly?) replaced by a different one. Other leaderboard types / KPIs. Not a hard requirement though.  With these features I feel like the app would be ready to offer users a proper and satisfying first experience. There\u2019s no possible way this can be completed by GR10, meaning I\u2019ll have until GR11 which should give some extra time. This is a side-project I work on after my normal working hours, so that extra time is a nice boon. Why? There\u2019s two reasons why I\u2019ve decided to create this app. The first reason is that whenever a new funding round kicks off, people are presented and overwhelmed with an enormous collection of grants they might contribute to. You can search by terms and tags, but you still have to manually browse through a big list, which isn\u2019t very fun. What usually happens is that people ask around, seeking grant recommendations from people they know and trust. This leads to funding becoming a popularity contest where a lot of hidden gems might not get the attention they deserve. The goal of this app is to introduce gamifications that not only should make exploration fun, but also provide a better experience overall where projects will get the attention they so rightfully deserve. The second reason is that Gitcoin wants to be a credibly neutral platform and focus on solving the problem of public goods (funding), not necessarily showcasing users what grants should be to their likings. Such algorithms could also be accused of being biased in some way or another, damaging Gitcoin\u2019s legitimacy. This app could relieve Gitcoin from that duty. Will it be open source? Naturally. I\u2019m planning to release the source together with the MVP when it is deemed ready. For those interested, the front-end is made with Vue + Typescript. The back-end is written in C# with .NET 5.

The app is \u2018just\u2019 a website with a small back-end that runs fine for now on a $5/mo VPS. Scaling is not a problem yet. The app\u2019s also living on the very outskirts of Ethereum so it doesn\u2019t really interact with the blockchain at all, aside from the shopping cart I\u2019m working on right now using zkSync. In the future I also might use somebody\u2019s Metamask to store personal settings but that\u2019s about it. I was planning on just dogfeeding the project by having a grant up on Gitcoin itself. Of course I\u2019d be happy to connect with other people if they have any ideas, suggestions or need help in general! ",
