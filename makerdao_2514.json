My hope was to see a working group form on this and give a report. I really think this topic needs a revisit and while I am posting this thread as a reminder I am not offering to spearhead this (family/work other issues too demanding of my time atm). Here are the links to what I could drag up.     Governance Initiative: DeFi Consortium on Emergency Shutdown Criterion Governance       What is happening?  A handful of MakerDAO community members are congregating a DeFi Consortium. The group is intended to be open to members from other DeFi project communities, and gather diverse opinions on Maker protocol topics. The first topic will be on the decision criterion, technical execution, and larger community risk mitigation plans surrounding the MakerDAO\u2019s Emergency Shutdown (ES).  Why is this happening?  Simply put - there is an opportunity to mitigate risk in the larger DeFi envi\u2026         What about Emergency Shutdown - Why Have we Ignored This Mechanism? Governance       Heeding @cyrus and @MakerMan words we need to be prepared for possible scenarios.  Everyone sees ES as catastrophic, but we need to engage with that mechanism to understand our options.  Potentially it will be much less catastrophic if initiated before losses get extreme and while the system is still collateralized.  Determining what is extreme is the question. Aka COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS of ES. Without ES as an option we risk really destroying dai holders, vault owners and/or mkr holders. It is c\u2026         Emergency Shutdown Governance       Emergency shutdown marks the end of any value to the MKR token. MKR holders should be willing to consider almost any other option. My recommendation is that code is written to allow the protocol to buy ETH directly on the market using newly created Dai, which will restore the peg.         Questions/Discussion on the Emergency Shutdown Governance   @LongForWisdom Fair enough. My intentions were based on bringing attention to the subject, and not letting people skip-out/dodge the question. But I get your drift.  Circling back to what\u2019s more important, with regards to @iammeeoh and question A., I believe we should get some further clarifications\u2013so I\u2019ll leave you with this from an interview in January 2019, as it\u2019s the only guidance that I\u2019ve been able to find with regards to such question:  Laura Shin:  And I\u2019m sorry, in the case of a troll\u2026     I want to say while this topic is a complex one that the community should revisit I think it needs to be revisited particularly in light of the future of Maker.   My thoughts on this was a general why can\u2019t we just put halts in pieces of the system we are concerned will be compromised like we did with the auction system.   My point here is I would like to revisit this with an angle.   Can we just halt the key system components to do \u2018maintenance work\u2019 and have that Maker features are \u2018in maintenance\u2019 bubble up to 3rd party interfaces.   Is this doable?  What are the hazards?   Can we eliminate or mitigate the whole ES as an attack surface as well as mitigate issues that might crop up in an ES with certain types of collateral.   ",

The Emergency Shutdown (correct me if I am mistaken) is a leftover from the TheDAO disaster in 2016. Lesson learned: there must be a way to shut down a system that has serious vulnerabilities or is outright malfunctioning. On paper Emergency Shutdown worked, but the world of crypto has moved on since then. In 2016 the various blockchains and teams were more or less operating independently with the major problem being faulty code. In 2020 coding errors are fewer and crypto is rapidly integrating across both projects and blockchains - and in the case of Maker even starting to bridge into real world assets. The net effect of this is that the negative consequences of an Emergency Shutdown have increased hugely and is something that should be avoided at nearly all cost. It is generally a much better option to use DarkSpells or Emergency Voting for handling serious situations. Emergency Shutdown, while still possible, is gradually slipping lower and lower down on the menu of options. ",

Admittedly, there was an interest from myself and a couple of others from the DeFi community to understand the full extent of what an ES meant. However, things move quickly in this space, and we all have divided attention (at least I know I have). Personally, I think @Planet_X makes some good points. The crux of the problem tho is that ES isn\u2019t commonly understood and there are other tools that could be used in different scenarios. I can\u2019t speak to the efficacy of each or what future scenarios look like, but part of the discussion is to have all things considered ahead of time lest governance is scrambling to get on the same page were a new crisis to arise again.

Will there be manipulations by whales to DAI price (ES conditions) before, during and after the ES? \u2026  As a guideline, I would set the condition for the ES to:  DAI price for 3 months constantly above the peg (done) DAI price>$1.015 for more than 10-30 days (waiting for that condition)  ",

We just haven\u2019t been able to successfully meet the demand for Dai to bring the peg to perfect equilibrium. One idea is to  create a standard deviation for \u2018the peg\u2019 that\u2019s acceptable, which changes throughout the roadmap of Dai, with a narrower band of acceptable deviation from the $1 peg as the product matures and time goes on.  If we stray from the defined band for a certain period of time, we could consider more drastic action.  With a larger supply and more diverse collateral, we will naturally convene at $1 over time; IMO we should be forgiving in the short term. I know this seems dramatic or dismissive to some, but the market doesn\u2019t seem to care that the peg is off by a bit.  In fact, adoption, usage, demand, and liquidity for Dai has been the highest it\u2019s ever been despite the peg being off.  The foundation has mentioned the peg being off hampering credibility/adoption of Dai, but the market is telling us otherwise.  We have some serious network effects and adoption like we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of Dai.  I think when we get into the 10-20% territory consistently or start behaving like AMPL\u2019s price we will start to lose complete credibility\u2013and it will be obvious that we need to shut down. Dai is nascent and growing experiment and compared to the volatility of it\u2019s underlying collateral, is performing exceptionally well.  We must continue to grow aggressively, not shut down. ",

Failing keepers means adding a bigger risk for those who ensure the peg is maintained. In the long run, that will simply add problems and lost of credibility to our DAO. The current demand for DAI doesn\u2019t care about the value being 3%, or maybe even 10% above the USD, and that\u2019s because they earn 500% farming YFI, or any other of those incentives at the moment. That\u2019s not always to be the case. But once again, those who are working to keep the peg, generating DAI and buying back USDC with the hope of it going back to at least 1.01, we are directly damaging those at this precise instant. I don\u2019t support an emergency shutdown at all. But we shouldn\u2019t ignore (even for a few days) the value of DAI skyrocketing (BTW, it seams nobody worries when it goes up that much, for those who doesn\u2019t know a thing, when they will have DAI and the price goes down, I\u2019m sure their opinions respect to what is DAI and how it keeps its price will be quite different than our) ",
