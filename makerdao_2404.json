One of those activities is a proto-Governance communications group. Starting back with our project plan posted by Mitote to a recent chat from cryptowanderer. There have been mentions, doc templates, and ideas swirling around a \u201cDecentralized Governance PR-team\u201d or \u201carchive-all-the-threads-website kinda thing\u201d for a bit. A small team has taken some initiative to help scope and frame these ideas but we\u2019ve hit some roadblocks along the way. Ergo, we\u2019ve got this form to ask everyone who participates in Governance about Governance communications. Consider this form a call for more insights and more members. We have a group in rocketchat and a weekly call to try and build towards some sort of cadence if anyone is interested in joining ping me. We welcome everyone\u2019s feedback so we can get a template for \u201ccomms-at-a-glance\u201d agreed upon and build a network of contributors that help improve Governance communications every other week.
