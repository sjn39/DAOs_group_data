DEVs utilizing some type of Consensus of Attention mechanism will at least give a leg up from standard Best-Effort public-messaging\u2026 where you just wait/pray for node adoption\u2026 If there was some type of Consensus of Attention mechanism utilized before vulnerable information was released\u2026 then this would delay things just long enough until a majority of node runners were AWARE anything was happening at all\u2026 Thus once you know you have a Consensus of Attention then you can divulge the fix/error/info accordingly and give the GOOD actors enough time to make sure the upgrade has a higher consensus than the older SW. In the current release, you can see this is NOT the case\u2026 1.10.6 is leading the pack\u2026 1.10.8 marginally 2nd\u2026 with COA you either would have converged faster\u2026 or possibly not have forked\u2026 If we simply gain Consensus of Attention before releasing upgrades/announcements then even a forked chain wouldn\u2019t have much traction. Don\u2019t let your efforts die in vain\u2026 gain Consensus of Attention before future releases please  PLEASE UPGRADE GETH:   GitHub    Release Hades Gamma (v1.10.8) \u00b7 ethereum/go-ethereum Geth v1.10.8 is a pre-announced hotfix release to patch a vulnerability in the EVM (CVE-2021-39137).

The lack of attention to simple upgrades can lead to vulnerabilities and chain forks. The proposal suggests that utilizing a COA mechanism will give the good actors a fighting chance to overcome the threat and adopt the hard work and development efforts.
