Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: October 15th, 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: We did a great job for the Optimism NFT community by launching mint only for OP token and sold it out less then in 24h. We attract a lot of new members from other chains as well. Our goal is to make OP NFT market to another level by providing a top-tier community space, utilities and ecosystem products. We will become not only an NFT collection but a space where new minters and builders can get knowledge, exposure, connections and other support. This will make Optimism NFT more easy to enter and more attractive comparing to other L2. This funding opportunity is a way to support the whole OP NFT community as OAYC is on of the most active and valuable projects of the ecosystem. Incentivizes will be used not only to support current community but to attract new users from other chains as well. Number of OP tokens requested: 100,000 $OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No Proposal for token distribution: 60% \u2013 Staking pool Concept: We will use OP rewards to create staking pool and provide rewards for these holders who lock their NFT in stacking contract. Maintain the $OP NFT ecosystem alive and live, attracts a new buyer and liquidity to the ecosystem. Terms: 1 month to launch KPI: decrease listings (<6%) and attract new buyers and liquidity. 40% \u2013 Community missions rewards Concept: We will motivate community to complete missions and receive OP rewards. This will help us to promote OAYC itself and OP NFT market in general. Typical missions: content sharing, testing, participation in votings, etc Terms: 1 month to launch KPI: 30 000+ twitter followers, +500 unique holders Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability: NFT contract: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0deaAc29d8A3d4EbBAAa3eCd3cC97C9deF00f720 Opense link: https://opensea.io/collection/optiapeyachtclub ",

I would like to add that I have had originally reached out to this team to see if I could offer proper guidance on a proposal. Beyond our original conversation I never heard back and had a very hard time trying to reach any official team member after that point. Having community support is great but it really needs to be more formal for governance. Is there a way to see any examples of bounties or quests from the OAYC project that was distributed from the OP token that everyone minted with? I believe there was 100,000 or more OP raised from the initial mint and would love to see a dune analytics chart or some official metrics to see how much of that was used to create previous initiatives within the community of the Optimism network since the original mint. That would help provide clarity to fellow governance members on how the OP tokens from a grant might be distributed to the holders or outside of the network to help onboard other individuals from outside the ecosystem.

Regarding previous initiatives, OAYC has launched dozens of community giveaways and marketing campaigns to bring more people to the Optimism NFT and keep the current community active. It helped us to reach almost 500 ETH trading volume in 2 months and +2000% ATH floor price. We need some time to sum up the number, examples, and performance of these initiatives. And we have already made a forecast of the results that can be expected from the use of this grant in the future. You can find it in the proposal. ",

I am hearing concerns from other members within the community about the most recent mint from the Oayc project and whether the funds from minting the project are involved with any retroactive donations. I am curious as well to hear if there has been any contributions to the Optimism ecosystem since the launch of the project. Approximately 80,000 more OP tokens were just collected from a secondary mint so I am not sure why more assistance with funding is needed if that is the case. Please provide any data using DUNE analytics from the project that can help show the other members of the governance the statistics of the previous mints, the way the original mint funds were used for public goods, or any initiatives led by the project team in a clear & transparent manner.

Please, OAYC is absolutely not a fake project from BAYC, this is totally a different and new project especially born for Optimism, so please kindly help us, the sucess of OAYC will also be the sucess for the Optimism, I don\u2019t see any great NFT so far in other L2 projects. Optimism will be best L2, OAYC will also be the most important NFT project in OP ecosystem. ",

You are not showing the OP governance the proper information to help support this grant at the moment and help reassure members of the community that the funds will be distributed in a proper well thought out manner that is displayed in the token distribution schedule of the grant proposal. Please remember that it was also asked that you stop having members who are not involved with the OP governance delegation process to stop comments here. They continue to interrupt the forum which was intended as a place for a valuable conversation based around the presentation of the grant with other delegate members. It is great that your project did well in sales but that is not enough info to approve this proposal. Also in the last sentence you mentioned that if you had the funding you, \u201c will make community better and OP NFT space stronger. \u201c What happened to the original funding of the project and how was that not possible with over 180,000 OP tokens raised in the past 4 months of your project ??? Something does not seem right about a project which raised such a high amount of OP token for their project and at the same time they are not able to submit the proper information necessary for a grant proposal. Especially when asked numerous times after hearing concerns from other community members within the OP NFT space. Now the ask is 100,000 tokens but with zero data on track history from the project treasury. At this time I can not support this proposal with the lack of metrics provided and will ask once again to have members of your community please refrain from using this forum as some sort of social media platform to try promoting your project.

My question now is, what did you do with that money? how did you spend it on the community and roadmap, these things should be made known to us the community members because we have a right to know and if granted this fund from OP how do you intend to judiciously utilize it. That money is different from total volume, so there should be so much money in the vault. I remember when the community members said you should reward me as a lot of them joined OAYC because of the constant shilling i did, and you told me to open a ticket and instead of doing the right thing, you condemned me for raising a riot i knew nothing about, fast forward till now, where are the whales that first came, they left because of lack of proper management.

                    "content": "As you can see here there was a social media post driving traffic to the forums and if you continue on reading you will see in the forum where I asked kindly to not have their users directed here. The request was ignored as well as any additional information that was requested about the metrics and track record of the project to help show members of the governance why the project should be considered for a grant. If the applicants do not understand the code of conduct on the governance forums and do not respect the request of other governance committee members by ignoring them and continue to do so then the chances of receiving funding are much less likely. I suggest to keep any community members commentary separate from the forums unless they themselves are a delegate of Optimism governance and have something valuable to add to the conversation such as statistical data or facts about the project and it\u2019s current standings.     MinimalGravitas:  Please can you not brigade threads like this. There is no benefit to encouraging your followers to spam comments here that do not discuss the specifics of a proposal. Dozens of new users posting nothing but general support for something does not make for useful conversation.   ",
