Needless to say, Maker is not going to scale unless the organization is first functional. With functionality, I refer to directions that if left untouched will not damage Maker in the foreseeable future. It is a good-enough approach - not perfection. Accordingly, issues such as governance overhead and organizational focus have me worried. This is also why I believe we need to nurture softer aspects like community spirit and culture carefully. Building a community capable of continuously attracting talent is the goal. With regards to scaling, I am an out-of-the-closet shameless enthusiast. When I refer to scaling I do not mean to settle for the slow organic growth of a few assets per month, I am talking about configurations capable of eventually handling thousands of collateral types per month.  Naturally, this is not doable with a system depending largely on human interaction which is why I am a big believer in things like automation, incentives, and staking. Examples of articles by me involving scaling: Staking 1 Staking 2 Staking 3 Staking 4 Vault topography Avoiding Ren Protocol\u2019s mistakes Examples of articles involving functionality: Governance overhead Dependence on major token holders Shareholder vs Tokenholder Other work: Not afraid to sometimes do a hard but necessary job Telling it like it is Trying to be constructive What you get when you delegate to me:  Full-time crypto enthusiast, an investor in Maker since 2016. Near-total interest alignment, basically looking after my most substantial investment anyway. High attendance rate  Conflicts of Interest I hold other cryptos in addition to MKR, but the relative amounts are such that I do not think it will impair my judgment. If significant portfolio changes are made, I will notify the community. I hereby agree to the Delegate Code of Conduct ",

EDIT 13 Aug 2021: The ask is less than 1x - I should have looked at the \u201cPrincipal Deployed\u201d figure. Assets - 120db loans are secured, tax credits are example of assets that can be resold if necessary. The deal is not similar to unsecured business loans. ",

I think the onboarding process could be streamlined to only vote on asset onboarding after both initial screening and risk analysis have been completed. Later assets could be auto-onboarded provided they meet certain criteria. Adjusting Auction Parameters for ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, and WBTC-A - September 20, 2021 - yes. The argumentation presented to the community for auction parameter adjustment was very solid. Increase the System Surplus Buffer - September 20, 2021 - no. I voted no on this proposal because:   The protocol is presently running an operational loss and so will not fill up the Surplus Buffer to even the previously agreed DAI 60 million any time in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, filling the Surplus Buffer up to DAI 100 million is a theoretical question only. This signal should not even have made it onto the poll.   If anyone is worried about the SEC the poll wording could have been changed to \u2018never mint or burn as long as the Maker status with SEC is uncertain\u2019. That is a valid argument, but it is not the question being polled.   ",

I\u2019ll try to break them down here to give insight into my future decision making. Expanding DAI supply and market share - I firmly believe that Maker can\u2019t be financially sustainable at its current scale. We\u2019ll need a substantially larger DAI supply before we can cover our fixed costs and reach a point of positive unit economics. With this in mind, I\u2019m ok to invest into growing our supply and market share even if this leads to negative cashflow in the short to medium term. I see Maker sort of like Amazon or other platform economy companies in the early 2000s - we should be comfortable investing in growth even if this requires raising capital or selling MKR, because this is what will allow us to become financially self-sustainable in the future. That being said, we need to stay focused on cost control so we can reach this crossover point as soon as possible. Building bridges between Maker and other communities - Beyond competing on price, Maker also competes with other lending or stablecoin offerings based on relationships and narratives. We should focus on building strong ties with other communities, so they can feel invested in our success and have the confidence to incorporate DAI as a key part of their protocol. This goes beyond token listings, and could include co-sponsored grants, self regulatory organizations, or other shared initiatives to drive the space forward. Minimize risk of DAI holder losses - In my view this is the most important responsibility of the Maker protocol. We offer the safest stablecoin available today, with diversification of collateral, sound governance, and a credible risk backstop from MKR holders. This gives us a huge benefit where people are willing to hold DAI without any intrinsic subsidy from MakerDAO (such as the DSR, which is currently at a nominal 0.01%). Maintaining this focus on safety is not only the right thing to do for users, but also benefits our economics (greater net interest margin for any given stability fee we charge) and regulatory positioning (a safe and sound system is less concerning to prudential regulators). Decisions that benefit MKR holders at the expense of DAI holders are likely to be self defeating over a long enough timeframe.  Conflicts of Interest I hold financial stakes in a broad range of tokens and crypto assets. Most holdings are in my public ENS account monetsupply.eth. I also hold small amounts of BTC plus assets from Cosmos, Polkadot, and Solana ecosystems. Holdings include Maker protocol competitors such as COMP and AAVE. I have made investments in certain projects / companies on terms not available to the public. This includes:  10 ETH investment into LidoDAO LDO tokens (terms posted publicly here) Investment of less than $10,000 into Rabbithole (private funding round) Employee stock package from Tally   I\u2019m a core contributor to the Risk Core Unit, and receive income from MakerDAO in this capacity. I also receive employment income from Tally. In the future, I may take part time / contracting work with Aave as part of their proposed risk team. I\u2019m a reviewer on the Compound and Uniswap grant program committees. Uniswap is planning to begin compensating committee members for their time, so I may receive income from Uniswap Grants in the future. I participate in several governance protocols beyond MakerDAO. Most of my protocol activity can be seen on Tally here. My voting power currently exceeds the proposal thresholds for Uniswap and Compound governance. I will make best efforts to update this disclosure statement when there are any material changes. Furthermore, I\u2019ll recuse myself from participation in any cases where I feel I\u2019m unable to make an unbiased decision. I have read and agree to the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of liability By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.

But abstention doesn\u2019t really solve the problem. Voting is politics and in any political system there\u2019s an implied or overt practice of vote trading. Basically if you were a delegate, we would need to trust you to act against your incentive.

I\u2019m not sure what we would do for constituents that wanted opposing positions on a poll you were personally recused from, though.   In my view, delegates\u2019 responsibility is to share their perspective and expected voting behavior transparently, and then vote owners are responsible for selecting a delegate that aligns with their preferences. So if a vote owner wants to be sure that their delegate would participate in all polls involving the risk core unit, they shouldn\u2019t delegate to me. I will listen to and value constituent feedback, but will not be taking directions from delegators. So I\u2019m not so concerned with what my delegators want specifically, more with what in my view is best for the Maker Protocol and MakerDAO.

So long as we are aware of the potential conflict of interest, voters are informed and can decide appropriately how to manage their individual MKR holdings.

Delegate compensation seems reasonable, although I support efforts to make the participation rate cutoffs a bit more forgiving. The GUNIDAIUSDC2-A vault (0.01% fee tier) will be a valuable addition, and I\u2019m glad we were able to pivot so quickly after trading volumes began to decline in the 0.05% fee tier (GUNIDAIUSDC1-A).

Community greenlight poll GUNI-DAI-USDP - Abstain    Generally I think onboarding additional stablecoin GUNI pools is a good idea, as it will improve DAI liquidity on Uniswap. But this proposal is specifically for the implementation on the 0.05% fee tier, while most liquidity and volume for DAI/USDP is using the 0.01% fee tier (so this particular GUNI implementation likely would not see any use). I\u2019ll happily support onboarding a pool based on the 0.01% fee tier (although operating expenses could be problematic if pool trading volume isn\u2019t high enough).  Community greenlight poll aUST - Voting against    Yield on UST deposits to Anchor (represented by aUST) are very high, currently nearly 20%. Maybe this could leave enough yield potential for MakerDAO to compensate for platform and stablecoin risks. But overall I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. The UST algorithmic stabilization mechanism is vulnerable to bank run situations (the peg almost broke in May of this year). Anchor also faces additional lending risks, including concentrated exposure to bLUNA collateral (tokenized staked LUNA) which has a relatively small liquidity pool for trading or faces 21 days unbonding period to return to LUNA.

Decreasing the gap (target available debt) helps reduce risk of undercollateralized debt during crashes, particularly important for a token that has historically seen some very large flash crashes.

In the future, I\u2019d like to set up some \u201cpass through polling\u201d mechanisms to allow delegates to ask their supporters on sensitive issues such as delegate compensation, where delegate voting could create the appearance of conflict of interest.

While I\u2019m a bit concerned that this could undermine Maker\u2019s core vaults by making Aave more competitive, the magnitude of the change is fairly small and we\u2019ll be able to change course if this creates a problem. Additionally, we\u2019ve recently seen the D3M module have periods of 0 utilization, which represents the \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d (not earning revenue, but still exposed to black swan risks of Aave protocol losing money) - slightly lowering the target rate will lead to more stable utilization and better compensation for D3M risks.  Dai direct deposit module (D3M) debt ceiling targetting -     First choice: 25% of real DAI supply   Second choice: 30% of real DAI supply    Limiting the maximum size of the D3M helps address competitiveness concerns about lowering the target borrow rate / bar parameter - the largest borrowers would still get the best rates from MakerDAO because D3M liquidity supplied to Aave is limited. For this reason, I prefer the relatively smaller debt ceiling increase to 25% of real DAI supplied (roughly ~210 million DAI). ",

Aave or Rari Capital. It also offers significant token incentives for DAI usage, and I think offering a D3M would offer a good risk/reward ratio while helping reduce DAI generated from stablecoins.  Raise the emergency shutdown module (ESM) threshold from 75,000 to 100,000 MKR  I\u2019d previously voted against an increase to 150,000 MKR, but I think 100,000 MKR strikes a better balance between reducing risk of shutdown attacks, while still ensuring ES can be triggered when necessary and providing for minority investor protections.  Increase the dust parameter for select LP token vaults  LP tokens require relatively higher gas costs to liquidate, and certain tokens (for example stablecoin-volatile Uniswap LPs) also have very low liquidation ratios which give less buffer for liquidations. These factors require higher dust limits to ensure Maker doesn\u2019t book losses on small value vaults.  Recover DAI locked in Optimism escrow  Considering that the DAI in question is clearly unrecoverable by the user, there\u2019s no risk of loss or double spending for Maker to help the user recover the funds. I\u2019d like to establish a scalable process for DAI recovery, but considering the large amount in question I think we should try to help out even before our recovery process has been established.  Ratification poll for modify core unit budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs)  The proposal is really thorough and explains all of the cost drivers for Maker\u2019s oracle expenses. I\u2019m comfortable reimbursing the foundation for costs incurred since August 2021, as the foundation has already demonstrated good faith action to the DAO through the transfer of most of their remaining MKR tokens.  Ratification poll for onboarding tech-ops core unit (TECH-001)  Techops / devops is a critical part of any technology org. Having a dedicated team will help avoid unnecessary duplicate infrastructure and work across core units.  Ratification poll for the strategic finance core unit (SF-001)  This core unit will bring a bunch of important benefits to Maker. For operations, this could help MakerDAO make better resource allocation and budgeting decisions based on data. I also expect this core unit could help us develop a more sophisticated policy for managing and investing the surplus buffer, and managing higher order portfolio risks like asset-liability duration mismatch (which will become more important as we scale up RWA and other fixed rate borrowing facilities). I think this will be really good value for money spent!  Ratification poll for collateral offboarding process (MIP62)  This is a simple MIP, and will help avoid future issues of vault users being unaware of collateral offboarding. Over time this should help Maker maintain good PR and relationships with users large and small, without significantly increasing work required for asset offboarding.  Ratification poll for core unit budget, SNE-001  By all accounts Starknet Engineering Core unit has been delivering on their mandate so far. I\u2019m happy to support their further work and also appreciate Starknet\u2019s coinvestment into these efforts (costs split 50/50 between Maker and Starknet).  Ratification poll for bug bounty program for MakerDAO critical infrastructure  Proposed payout tiers seem reasonable, and ImmuneFi is already building up a strong reputation for bug bounty program management.  Ratification poll for Maker keeper network (MIP63)  Maker has often taken a \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d approach to keeper incentivization, but the economics of providing these services are pretty challenging. I think the proposed mechanism could significantly improve resilience and economic sustainability.  Ratification poll for facilitator onboarding for RWF-001  Will Remor has deep credit experience and I\u2019m confident he has what it takes to do this job well.  Ratification poll for Development and UX core unit budget - DUX-001  No changes to actual budget amount, this is just a process improvement to streamline intra-DAO payments.  Ratification poll for modify core unity budget - sustainable ecosystem scaling (SES-001)  Same as above, the process changes seem reasonable.  Abstain votes:  Prioritize DAI direct deposit module (D3M) for Maple Finance  Maple offers high rates of return (looks like most pools are offering 7%+ APY), but also high risk. If any of the trading firms involved run into financial difficulties, I\u2019d bet Maple LPs would be last in line for repayment (after collateralized lenders, other trading firm counterparties, or anyone else who has greater leverage over the borrower). I\u2019m not sure if the returns justify the risk.  Community greenlight poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings)  The proposal is fairly well thought through, and in general I think real estate loans can be good quality collateral for Maker. But Robinland\u2019s explanation of liquidation safeguards doesn\u2019t make sense to me - they mention Maker having a put option on the RBL token collateral, but then explain this will be executed purely on a best efforts basis and basically Maker can only exercise the option if Robinland is able to find another buyer. I don\u2019t see how this provides any protection.  Community greenlight poll - TUSD-PSM  I would support onboarding a \u201csell only\u201d PSM to move our existing TUSD holdings into a more suitable vault mechanism. But I\u2019m not interested in accepting additional TUSD collateral until Trusttoken provides a satisfactory, non-evasive explanation of their ownership structure.  Ratification poll for offboarding content production core unit  From a personal perspective, I enjoy content production team\u2019s Multichain DAI-Lights a lot. But I agree with the criticism that OKRs (objectives and key results) should be more clear. The cost vs output also seems relatively high.  Voting against:  Community greenlight poll: OGN (Origin Protocol)  OGN has relatively low liquidity and market capitalization, and I don\u2019t think Maker would be able to reach profitability on an OGN vault type. Beyond this, I\u2019m not confident in Origin\u2019s long term success - it seems like they pivot to the next hot crypto vertical every few months without finding product market fit.  Community greenlight poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar)  There is significant credit risk from underlying USDT holdings. I don\u2019t think this stablecoin offers any additional value to Maker to compensate for the risk. Currently most OUSD is farming CRV due to high gauge weight bribes, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of organic usage or adoption.  Community greenlight poll - USDap (BondAppetit)  The proposal is underspecified. We\u2019re missing details about the composition of underlying bond portfolio (credit risk, duration, etc). From what I read it also looks like USDap is issued 1:1 against bond collateral at current market price - this doesn\u2019t make any sense to me because fixed income assets can fall in price depending on interest rate, credit risk, and liquidity conditions. The mechanism also makes it seem like bond interest is paid out to governance token holders instead of USDap holders, so it\u2019s not at all clear to me how this asset could support the proposed 3% stability fee.

For the put option for the RBL tokens: key elements of it was borrowed from an approved proposal (peoples\u2019 company) but we do recognize your concern. We want to emphasize that in case where Maker would like to execute the put option, we will \u2018continue this process until Maker\u2019s demand is satisfied\u2019 so the process will continue until all of what Maker wants to sell is executed. The only reason why we didn\u2019t promise a specific timeframe is that how soon the RBL tokens get sold depend on the market condition. In normal market condition, we don\u2019t expect this process to be long, as these are security tokens that represent high quality loan assets generating steady interest returns. Robinland will not only reach out to institutional buyers, but also list them on popular security token exchanges such as Securitize, etc. Thus we are confident the sales can be executed successfully within reasonable timeframe. Another aspect we want to highlight is the part on \u2018Liquidation\u2019 in the last part of the proposal. There are 3 layers of protection for Maker provided by Robinland. Most notably, given the real estate industry connections our COO Venus has (developed in her 7 years of career in the industry), we are in a network of buyers of such real estate debt projects, so if we were to sell the underlying asset, the sale can be executed quickly at reasonable price as well. So if we had to, we could also execute the sale of the loan such that we have the ability to buy back the RBL tokens. Really appreciate your comment and hope the above addresses some of your concern!

MOMC Parameter Changes, Decrease the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio - January 21, 2022  Voted in favor : MOMC rate reductions make sense (further broad reductions may be necessary given market downturn), and collaterals with reduced debt ceiling will still be far from full utilization so there\u2019s little risk of missing out on demand. The GUNI liquidation ratio and rate changes are reasonable and should help facilitate migration from the existing 0.05% fee pool.

I\u2019d like to continue working with NFTX and other NFT projects to see how Maker can efficiently and safely extend credit against these assets. *** I\u2019ve fallen a bit behind on sharing voting reasons for previous weeks!

Polls Ending March 28, 2022  Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent - Invest in Short-Term Bonds (MIP13c3-SP12) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : The devil is/will be in the details, but in principle investing into short/intermediate term fixed income assets is probably the best, lowest risk, and most scalable way to increase our RWA exposure and reduce concentrated stablecoin holdings (which earn 0% yield so by definition have negative expected value when accounting for risk). We can benefit from the investor protection and credit rating infrastructure already in place within traditional finance. As a declaration of intent (with exact details still tbd), I\u2019m happy to support this.  Ratification Poll for Facilitators Offboarding (MDS-001) (MIP41c5-SP5) - March 14, 2022  Voting against : This CU doesn\u2019t cost us anything, so I don\u2019t see any reason to force through offboarding. If another group believes they can offer a better service to MakerDAO, they are welcome to present themselves for consideration. Also interested to see if this group could become more effective living within the strategic happiness core unit. But I see no reason to rush this.  Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : Budget seems completely reasonable, and I feel Gov Alpha is consistently meeting/exceeding expectations. Happy to support.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : The budget request, particularly budget line item for professional (probably mostly legal) services seems objectively very large. But I have been really impressed with RWA team\u2019s professionalism and if they think this will help accelerate Maker\u2019s RWA initiatives in a safe and sound way I am prepared to support them. With such a large budget request, I think there is an even greater responsibility than normal to have maximum transparency and demonstrate to the community the value that this is bringing - I look forward to seeing the outputs over the coming months so we can decide if this outlay is really good value for money. Ideally, this larger budget for professional services will help us break the current deadlock on RWA onboarding and legal risks so we can begin to make serious progress; it\u2019s time to fish or cut bait.  Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : IMO gov alpha is performing well and this MKR compensation seems reasonable.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network (MIP63c4-SP3) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : Gelato team is great, I had the pleasure of chatting with them at Eth Denver and I think they will be a great addition to improve our resiliency.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP2) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : I\u2019m less familiar with Keep3r vs Gelato, but they\u2019re undoubtedly an OG of this sort of tech ops work and happy to see them added as a keeper as well.  Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) - March 14, 2022  Voted in favor : This will improve scalability for governance (less voting on very small expenditures), Immunefi CU has proven to date they are responsible with payouts, and it will also improve experience for hackers (less time waiting to get paid) which should on balance lead to more participation and better system safety.  Ratification Poll for Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) - March 14, 2022  I have not voted yet, but I intend to vote in favor  shortly before the poll closes. It feels like a conflict to vote on something that impacts delegate pay as a delegate myself, but on the other hand most active voting power is in the hands of delegates currently and it seems unreasonable to let a (imo high quality) proposal die if everyone just votes \u201cabstain\u201d by default. I\u2019m receptive to hearing any negative perspectives on this proposal and will adjust my vote accordingly if there are convincing arguments why this should not go through. ",

Polls Ending March 31, 2022  Short Ratification Poll for SPF ETHAmsterdam Event (MIP55c3-SP3) - March 28, 2022  Voted in favor : While it can feel like wasteful spending, I think hosting events can provide good value for money by maintaining Maker\u2019s presents and mindshare within the Ethereum and Defi communities.  Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge - March 28, 2022  Voted in favor : Proposed initial risk metrics look good. Will be interesting to see if 5M DAI is enough to maintain an orderly market (not have peg break to upside, etc).  Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) - March 28, 2022  Voted in favor : Housekeeping. These changes seem sensible to me.  Investigate Implementation of a Notional Finance D3M - March 28, 2022  Voted in favor : I feel strongly that we should only onboard fixed rate instruments as part of a wholistic strategy (have seen this sentiment in the forum thread). This should consider available providers (Notional, Yield, Element, etc), mechanism (eg. D3M vs TLM), and also see how this fits into Maker\u2019s overall portfolio management. I don\u2019t think we should commit significant resources to onboarding Notional until we\u2019ve done this prep work, but want to vote in favor to show interest/enthusiasm for integrating with fixed rate protocols in general.

Polls Ending April 7, 2022  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - April 4, 2022  Voted in favor : These changes should help Maker improve competitiveness on key products including stETH based vaults. Revenue impact is limited and well within Maker\u2019s financial capacity.  Launch Maker Wormhole With Optimism and Arbitrum Domains - April 4, 2022  Voted in favor : I\u2019m excited to see Maker come one step closer to achieving our cross-domain vision. Limits are conservative and well within Maker\u2019s capacity to absorb losses in a worst case scenario.

Thanks to other delegates and voters for promptly passing this to ensure safety of the protocol. I\u2019ll try to ensure a faster response in case of future emergency/unscheduled proposals.  Executive Vote Scheduled April 15, 2022  https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-offload-tusd-and-dai-transfers-april-15-2022  Voted in favor : Happy to see the TUSD vaults finally offboarded. Auctions cleared with minimal loss to Maker, and data from these auctions may help with offboarding other stablecoin collaterals in the future.  Polls Ending April 21, 2022  Short Ratification Poll to Amend MIP64 to allow more flexibility in scope (MIP4c3-SP3) - April 18, 2022  Voted in favor : This seems like a low risk change.

Whitelist Oasis.app on Multiple Oracles (MIP10c9-SP30) - April 18, 2022  Voted in favor : This should hopefully improve Oasis\u2019 functionality with no costs or drawback for MakerDAO. Easy yes.

Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : PECU has been performing well and budget request seems reasonable considering their workload and deliverables.  Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : I believe the mandate updates are positive, and move Maker towards a matrix organizational style common in successful companies (overlapping functional (horizontal) and product (vertical) groups that can specialize and collaborate effectively).  Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : The increased budget seems reasonable. Less than $2M per year total cost for a data organization is well within industry comps. I would prefer to expand the budget now and then trim scope/budget in the future if performance does not meet expectations or deliverables are better served within other CUs.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP62) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : Govcomms provides mission critical support to the DAO and budget changes seem reasonable given good past performance.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) - April 11, 2022  Voting against : I think PR manager would be more appropriate to live under a separate core unit (eg Marketing or similar). I see the govcomms team as having a more internal focus (eg members/contributors/stakeholders in MakerDAO) and externally focused comms (targeting non-maker affiliated persons, general media, etc) could be better served by an independent team.  Ratification Poll for Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh (MIP39c2-SP30) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : I\u2019m supportive of this mandate refresh (with understanding that outward focused PR duties included in the mandate cannot be fulfilled without corresponding funding approval for a PR project manager).  Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : CES has done a lot of work to streamline the collateral onboarding process and I think it makes sense that they are formally considered a collateral onboarding domain team.  Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : The changes provide a lot of improvements vs existing application form, including better coverage for trusted collateral and questions to help determine the business case for onboarding.  Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : I had the opportunity to attend both Daivinity events (Denver and Amsterdam) and they were both really well organized and professional. While the value of events is somewhat intangible, I think this is well worth the expense and will help ensure Maker retains mindshare across the defi ecosystem.  Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022  Voted in favor : The proposal seems sound, and should help standardize RWA onboarding (versus existing state where certain originators/counterparties have tried to end run the process and RWA domain teams in ways I feel are inappropriate).  Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) - April 11, 2022.  Voting against : I believe strongly in the value of open source innovation. I don\u2019t think the conditions for productive discussion and collaboration are in place at this time.  Polls Ending May 2, 2022  Community Greenlight Poll - sETH2 (Stakewise Staked ETH) - April 18, 2022  Voted in favor : I think onboarding multiple ETH staking derivatives in addition to Lido stETH (eg. Rocketpool rETH, and Stakewise sETH2 considered here) can help reduce Maker\u2019s counterparty risk exposure, while also creating positive externalities for Ethereum as a whole (less risk from liquid staking monopolies or validator centralization). Liquidity is still much lower than stETH so we will need to carefully review risks and parameters.  Community Greenlight Poll - HVBANK (Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Collateral) - April 18, 2022  Voted in favor : This RWA structure seems fairly well aligned between Maker and the originator. Initial risk retention of 50% is far above industry standards, and terminal 5% risk retention meets typical securitization practices. I\u2019d prefer deals that place Maker in senior position vs originator, but overall this deal seems to be sound from structuring perspective. I look forward to further analysis from RWF contributors if this greenlight passes. ",

For example, our Auction Assessment report. Gauntlet is a platform for risk management and parameter optimization for protocols. As such we will seek to provide insights into quantitative decisions with a focus on market risk. Gauntlet aims to elide ourselves from emotional and politically charged votes that do not readily admit quantitative analysis. Gauntlet will look to support measures to maximize risk adjusted protocol income through parameter changes, onboarding collateral, or other means. Gauntlet will look to support measures that do not materially impact the risk of insolvent debt for the protocol. Gauntlet generally support proposals for protocol development which further ecosystem growth, research, security, and novel use-cases. We (Gauntlet) have read and agree to the Delegate Code of Conduct. Conflicts of Interest  Gauntlet has and will continue to deploy our platform on other protocols and DAOs. Gauntlet holds token positions from prior work including but not limited to COMP, LQTY, SUSHI, and BAl. Gauntlet\u2019s investors may hold positions in MKR and other protocols In a Gauntlet capacity, I sit on the Aave Grants DAO and Compound Grants Program as a reviewer. Myself or additional Gauntlet employees may participate in other governance councils or DAOs in the future. Gauntlet is an active delegate on Compound and Uniswap.  ",

As a matter of priority, improving the \u201cusefulness\u201d of MKR by pushing for lending protocols to support it is a lower priority than improving the core protocol. However, improving the usefulness over time does help drive investment into MKR - this makes it a better backstop for the protocol. Using MKR just as collateral is beneficial to MKR holders as it reduces the circumstances in which they would be forced to sell. Now it is rare that people use an asset just as collateral, and there is a risk to governance if MKR is borrowed and lent as well. That being said, MKR should focus on trying to harden itself against these sorts of governance \u201cattacks\u201d - you can\u2019t rely on other protocols to do this with things like borrow caps etc. ",

Making one small update to \u201cconflicts of interest,\u201d we are now also delegates on Fei Protocol and dYdX. Regarding active proposals- we won\u2019t be participating in the ones that end Monday as we have not had enough time to run an analysis to form an opinion. We plan on participating in the next batch and thereafter. Please don\u2019t hesitate to respond with any questions/comments. Looking forward to being an active delegate within the Maker community.

Gauntlet voted YES for DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Net Rates Spread - Gauntlet\u2019s analyses show this is an efficient strategy for DAI distribution with the caveat that the Maker team should continue to be careful as it pertains to risk when expanding D3M usage. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier - In line with our stated voting philosophy, Gauntlet abstained from this poll as a quantitative analysis does not render a clear decision. Delegate Poll communication for polls ended 20 Dec 2021: Gauntlet voted NO for Community Greenlight Poll - aUST (Anchor TerraUSD) - Our analyses found several risks including UST market risk, Anchor lending platform market risk, and risks in bridging aUST from Terra to Ethereum. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Community Greenlight Poll - G-UNIv3-DAIUSDP (Gelato UniswapV3 DAI-USDP LP Token) - Gauntlet is generally supportive of greenlighting additional assets but our analysis revealed extremely low levels of liquidity in the 5bps pool. Delegate Poll communication for polls ended 13 Jan 2022 Gauntlet voted YES for Prioritize Onboarding a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - Compound maintains a strong risk management function and our analysis indicates that diversifying the D3M module to include Compound and the revenue Maker will earn from this is the optimal way forward. Gauntlet voted YES for Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults - Gauntlet is supportive of this adjustment as it ensures that liquidators can liquidate the vaults profitably by taking gas into account. Gauntlet voted YES for Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow - Our analysis indicates that these funds are currently unrecoverable by the transactor and that there are no risks to Maker in helping recover these funds. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance - Similar to other RWA proposals, Gauntlet abstained from this poll as a quantitative analysis does not render a clear decision. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold - In line with our stated voting philosophy, Gauntlet abstained from this poll as a quantitative analysis does not render a clear decision. Delegate Poll communication for polls ended 3 Feb 2022 Gauntlet voted YES for PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - Gauntlet\u2019s analysis of current market conditions after last week\u2019s volatility indicates that it is acceptable to systematically lower interest rates noted in this proposal. Delegate Poll communication for polls ending 7 Feb 2022 Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-NOTE (2 to 10 Year Duration US Treasury Securities) - In line with our stated voting philosophy, Gauntlet abstained from this poll as a quantitative analysis does not render a clear decision. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-TBILL (US Treasury Securities Up To 12 Months Duration) - In line with our stated voting philosophy, Gauntlet abstained from this poll as a quantitative analysis does not render a clear decision. Delegate Poll communication for polls ending 9 Feb 2022 Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial - Gauntlet abstained from this poll to avoid conflict of interest. Gauntlet ABSTAINED from Offloading TUSD-A - The decision to offload TUSD is related to strategic priorities for the Maker protocol and as such Gauntlet believes this decision should be made by the broader Maker community. A major consideration is resourcing around protocol development work and as this is not something where a quantitative analysis renders a clear decision abstaining keeps us aligned with our stated voting philosophy. Gauntlet voted YES to Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper - As this poll doesn\u2019t affect burn rate, rather just introduce a rate limiter, Gauntlet is supportive. ",

Gauntlet\u2019s analysis indicates that the GUSD debt ceiling can be safely raised to better align with USDP. It\u2019s notable that the current GUSD PSM utilization is low (21%), so the debt ceiling is not a limiting factor for issuing DAI through GUSD PSM. ",

Delegate Poll communication for polls ending 4 April 2022 Gauntlet voted YES to PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - Gauntlet\u2019s analysis of the rate changes is largely positive, except for GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A. That said, we voted yes since that one change does not adversely affect the risk of the protocol and our analysis agrees with the other proposed changes.

Maker has unique financial \u201csuperpowers\u201d that can best be used at scale, which requires the protocol to grow exponentially from its current position. In five years, I want Maker to be well known in all circles of power and finance, and in ten years to be well known in most households. We have an opportunity to do much good in the world, and reap the profits that come with fulfilling that mission. Maker has a destiny, and I am committed to making that destiny manifest. Maker currently wallows in capital inefficiency and an imperfect method of bridging the real world markets and the protocol. It is as though the world was gifted with Excalibur, and instead of changing the very landscape of the financial world, the legendary blade is left in its sheath, the edge dulled and its potential unfulfilled. Addressing these problems is my top priority, and have announced a plan to safely allow Maker to move into the publicly traded financial markets, create constituencies to defend Maker politically through a tidal wave of charitable giving financed by vast holdings of governments\u2019 own debts, and scale the supply and reach of DAI by at least an order of magnitude. Maker should only accept rates commensurate with the risk it shoulders, and providing safe sources of revenue to complement our core businesses should be at the forefront of our thoughts. Profits and scale bring with them security. At the same time, Maker\u2019s messaging and profile must undergo similar changes. Maker is no longer a quirky, anti-establishment crypto project. I brought a senior representative of the Federal Reserve to speak with us, and also a member of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Central banks and international finance organizations now approach us for data. US Senators make their advisors available to us to answer questions about upcoming legislation. Who else has so diligently labored to secure Maker through diplomacy? I need your support \u2013 directly through delegation or indirectly through voting your approval of the initiatives Maker requires \u2013 to ensure Maker sits at least as an equal alternative to central banks, governments, and the traditional financial order. We have outgrown discussion panels in ivory tower cloisters and now require a seat at the table with the powers we are increasingly interacting with. The world will continue to evolve, and it is vital that we harness that evolution to serve the world and the protocol. Maker offers a different, more benign, path than the existing financial order, and it deserves to be treated as a peer and partner for financial stability and growth \u2013 not feared because we have done a poor job of introducing ourselves to the world. Maker deserves to move freely in the real world, and its growth will be stunted if it dawdles inside the crypto financial sphere. Crypto is not enough. We should be financiers to governments, crowned heads, corporate titans, and tomorrow\u2019s innovators. The crypto markets are simply too small for this amazing machine we call Maker to realize its full potential to directly alter rates of growth and inflation, while providing a counterbalance to politically incentivized central banks and international agencies. It is imperative we demonstrate both our value as partners for, and our capability to act independently of, established centralized finance. Maker has many opportunities before it, but it also requires steady hands to avoid unforced errors. There will be enough challenges in front of us without inflicting them needlessly upon ourselves. By delegating your MKR votes to me, I can make sure professional, rigorous processes will be used by all operational core units. When messes are made, I will ensure they are cleaned up and that lessons are learned. The diffusion of responsibility within the DAO structure makes it difficult to ask hard questions when a hand is held out seeking funds. I have a history of asking those uncomfortable questions, and will continue to do so. Being a steward of voting power is a responsibility I take seriously. It is not a small thing to relinquish decision-making power to another party. But I need your support \u2013 either directly through delegation or through voting for initiatives in the plan outlined above \u2013 to help Maker become the beating heart of the world economy. It does not matter which, as long as you share my vision of what Maker can become. I am always available to speak in more detail about any issue or concern, and am already well practiced at listening to the privately voiced concerns of MKR holders and community members. Do not hesitate to reach out to me with ideas, problems, new information, or simply to vent. Communication is important, and that is especially so when some positions are nuanced. Anyone interested in delegating or coordinating votes for a common cause may request inclusion on a weekly summary of position on recent and upcoming votes. You may delegate voting power to Field Technologies, Inc. (aka @PaperImperium) here.  Conflicts of Interest   My personal holdings include mainly technology and real estate related assets, with no major  investments in financial services. I will recuse myself from any issue relating to a company that represents >1% of my liquid net worth or >2% of my total net worth (currently Apple, Alphabet, and Gladstone Land).   Field Technologies, Inc. has no substantial financial holdings, and has historically operated in the cultural resource management consulting space. I will recuse myself and Field Technologies. Inc. from any issue relating to a business partner. Without naming specific companies in advance, these are likely to be limited to large engineering firms and other infrastructure-related construction services providers.   I have read and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of liability By delegating to Field Technologies, Inc., you acknowledge and agree that Field Technologies, Inc. will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO. You may delegate voting power to Field Technologies, Inc. (aka @PaperImperium) here. ",

It contains CU budgets, a few prudent parameter changes to rates and DCs, and also some changes to ilk registries to make them more transparent (which is a request I have received twice from academic researchers attempting to learn more about Maker, so I know it will be useful) I have abstained on the poll for B. Protocol, but with the intention of coming to an informed decision before the poll ends in two week. I have voted yes on the poll for the Dai Foundation CU. They hold vital IP, and will need financial support. Any details that are still in the air can be worked out later, but there is no alternative to supporting this CU and helping it coordinate with the DAO. I have voted yes on the poll for the MKR vesting plan for Growth CU. I am generally opposed to any unnecessary dilution of MKR. But in this case, the relatively low DAI-based budget for this CU combined with its excellent track record of over-delivering, and the modest MKR request plan has convinced me to vote yes. I have voted yes to greenlight RWA-120db for further consideration as a collateral asset to onboard. This is an interesting asset and I see no reason not to hear more specifics and proposed terms from Risk. If you would like to discuss these or other proposals in detail, please DM me here, on RocketChat, or email me. If you would like to delegate MKR to me (which would also boost the weighting of polls that have not yet closed), you may do so here. ",

                    "content": " My Next Medium-Term Priorities To Grow Maker   Our real-world assets (RWA) program is finally entering full swing with a $15m debt ceiling for 6S Capital, a clear path forward to iron out issues with Centrifuge, and the prospect of financing the Solar X project. These will provide us ample opportunity to renew efforts to show how Maker and DeFi are integrating positively with the real-world economy. More details to come in the next few weeks.   The proposal by Deco Protocol has opened the door to a powerful new way to solidify DAI as the bedrock of decentralized finance. The proposal itself is somewhat complex and I encourage you to read it, but the main benefit for Maker is not the ability to offer fixed rate vaults, but as a way for Maker to easily finance both zero-coupon (and thus fixed return) and variable-rate offerings. DeFi lacks such high-quality collateral from high-quality counterparties akin to Treasury bills. DeFi also lacks the functional repurchase market that kind of collateral enables. Both of these products (yield and zero) look like they could fulfill vital roles in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and would have the key quality of making denomination in DAI as the default everywhere. In short, I see this as a powerful weapon to take DeFi market share from USDC and expand the moat around Maker. I am not qualified to evaluate the code, and will yield to the opinions of our own experts. Should Deco Protocol not perform as advertised, I\u2019m certain we can find another way to do this. But this is an idea worth pursuing.   For a number of reasons, Maker is increasingly the financier to institutions and whales. We have simply not succeeded in getting DAI as the method of payment \u2013 much less the unit of account \u2013 for a cup of coffee or for a gallon of gasoline. I want us to find and partner with stablecoins that have a tight geographic focus. This would be beneficial to both Maker and the smaller, regional stablecoin. Maker could provide oracles, technical expertise, and capitalization to ensure a defensible peg. The regional stablecoin could provide DAI locked into a smart contract as backing (and thus continuously earning fees to the extent it is from vaults) and tackle getting smaller merchants, local payment processors, and peer-to-peer transactions to a scale where that regional stablecoin can become viable. This frees Maker to continue to focus on its strengths of serving institutions, while also revisiting its mission to bank the unbanked and serve those in hyper inflated countries. It would also serve as a bulwark against the growing Chainlink ecosystem, and what would be a relatively minor investment of DAI by Maker would likely pay large investment returns by allowing smaller, regional stablecoins to focus on growing retail transactions instead of reinventing their back end.   Continue outreach to academics. We need external, reputable eyes to publish more about Maker. In particular, I am keen to see \u201cstress tests\u201d done on both our balance sheet and peg. This will both highlight our strengths \u2013 overcollateralization, transparency, and compatibility with Federal Reserve policy \u2013 and position Maker as the responsible adult while USDC and Tether squabble about what counts as a cash equivalent to back their tokens.

It was never designed to raise revenue, and this is a marginal improvement to the DAI ecosystem to make this tool free to use. I have voted yes on Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type. I believe this deal is most risky in the very first tranche \u2013 which is ~$3.25 million \u2013 before the PPA is in hand. While this is not ideal, the land this tranche would be used to purchase is itself valuable, and protects us against total or major loss, which means Maker is unlikely to suffer any material loss even in worst case scenario. Additionally, the SolarX project is of a digestible size, and provides (as I requested early in the process and am glad to see) debt service reserves and positive exposure to higher interest rates in the future in the form of 550 bps above SOFR. Equally important, this is a project that can be used as a tangible, relatable example of the benefits of MakerDAO to the real world financial system. The construction will produce jobs, and the project is one of renewable, environmentally friendly energy. This will provide a powerful counter to the narrative being pushed in some policy circles that crypto is merely a casino or tool for speculation. My support for the SolarX project should not be construed as general support for a project finance program or the RWA Foundation structure. I concluded to support this project on its own, individual merits, and some risks were offset by the limited nature of catastrophic loss and the substantial political benefits of this project. If you would like to delegate MKR to me (which would also boost the weighting of polls that have not yet closed), you may do so here.  ",

How do we move this process from, hey, this is a cool collateral to onboard and delegate the work to a DAO team vs. actually doing the work before proposing the collateral. I think we would end up with a much shorter list of high-quality, Dai generating collateral types and refocus the expended time/energy to the appropriate party. It\u2019s still a community-driven process since the people interested in onboarding a collateral type actually do the work. Our enablement model is to provide the process/tools/guardrails, get out of the way, and allow others to put skin in the game including a risk/reward model. There is a collateral incentive discussion that is needed and I\u2019ll be teeing that up shortly. To be clear, this doesn\u2019t mean CES sits idly by and wait for the community to propose collateral. There are the current collateral operations, real world experiments, and a lot of work that needs to go into creating the enablement model. One of the goals is to ensure the collateral bottlenecks are removed\u2026hopefully, for good.  ",

I voted yes to onboard Gelato USDC-DAI as a collateral type. LP of two stablecoins. No reason not to try it. I voted yes to Adopt the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for PSM-PAX-A. This is a best practice, and should be implemented. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit Budget Q4 2021 to Q1 2022 (MIP40c3-SP29). Routine budget, no surprises. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Risk Core Unit MKR Compensation (MIP40c3-SP25). The instance of \u201cretroactive\u201d MKR should not be considered an endorsement of this approach in the future. I am open to considering it on a case-by-case basis, but am generally opposed to it. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (MIP40c3-SP31). Routine budget, no surprises. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, CES-001. I will monitor how this CU delivers value in its first few quarters, but want to note that a major reason that I support the concept of this unit is the principle of parallelism within the DAO. At present, there is no alternative reservoir of talent to swiftly move in should PE go dark for legal, financial, or personnel reasons. This CU is an opportunity to build more talent within the DAO that is capable of stepping in for our most basic duties if needed, and as a way to develop more talent that may want to start future CUs or move into existing ones. The service of collateral onboarding is also something that the DAO can use, and an updated, streamlined process would probably be an improvement in the rapidly changing crypto/RWA landscape. I have abstained from Ratification Poll for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001. I intend to vote yes or no when I have more thoroughly developed opinions. If you care to lobby me privately for/against this CU, please feel free to do so. I am actively soliciting input. Update: I have changed my vote to yes. This is not a large expense with high potential payoff. Even if it results in zero utility for the protocol, the expense is reasonable to take a risk with. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit, DUX-001. Their work done while incubated has been good. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001. This is an inexpensive CU and the facilitator is for the most part working for free. Like SourceCred, it is a good way to get new DAO members to engage with the community until they find something here they are passionate about. I have abstained from Ratification Poll for RWA Foundations (MIP58). It seems redundant with MIP21, and no reason to introduce superfluous MIPs that could have some unintended consequence down the road \u2013 like conflicting with other MIPs. MIP58 is concerned with legal structure and details that should mostly be in the articles of incorporation (or their equivalent) of a legal entity doing business with MakerDAO. If we decide to tweak something in the legal arrangement addressed in MIP58, would we then need to go through a process to amend the MIP first? I\u2019m open to input to change my vote. I am not outright opposed to it at present, it just seems unnecessary and I do not want to introduce something into the system that will prove irritating later. ",

Like the executive, these changes are technical in nature and do not appear to be very controversial. Field Technologies voted yes for Increase the System Surplus Buffer. I am generally in favor of Maker holding onto cash when possible. Perhaps most importantly, the unclear regulatory environment makes me extremely wary about MakerDAO issuing anything other than DAI. Should MKR be determined a security, all currently existing MKR was minted under the Foundation. I don\u2019t really the DAO to be on the hook for issuing MKR in the manner we would typically do it. Hopefully we can get some legal and regulatory clarity. Note that this has implications about my stance on the upcoming Deco Protocol proposal. Field Technologies voted to abstain on both Community Greenlight Poll - SB-DDC (Solid Block Detox Digital Coins) and Community Greenlight Poll - REIF-DROP (Commercial Real Estate Assets DROP). This represents a break from my stance to always vote yes on green light polls. My reasoning is still the same \u2013 they do not appear to have any real effect on the process of assessing and onboarding collateral. We should just scrap the green light polls. My default stance is now to always abstain from them unless there is some very egregious red flag to cause me to vote no. Field Technologies is in favor of learning more about both of these proposals, as I am about most applications. Note that regardless of its individual merits, I will still move to block any additional Centrifuge collaterals until the legal structure of those deals has been updated. My understanding is that this is already in progress, so it should just be a matter of waiting for that to be done. ",

This has been a runaway success, and thank you to @hexonaut for pushing for this collateral. Abstain on Greenlight Poll for Curve LP stETH-ETH. My policy is to abstain on green light polls unless there are major red flags, as I don\u2019t think these polls do anything of substance and should be discontinued. No on Deco Protocol. This was a tough decision, as I like much of the product that is proposed. But the safety of Maker Protocol and DAI holders has to come first, and yield-bearing instruments should not be issued by Maker at this time. I encourage the Deco team to come back in 6 months or a year when there may be more regulatory certainty, but I want Maker to attract as little attention as possible, since we currently engage in few or no activities likely to bring regulatory scrutiny. Yes on Data Insights Core Unit. We need this yesterday, and the team also made extremely reasonable edits to their scoped budget after constructive input from @Planet_X. No on Maker Labs Core Unit. This application seemed a bit rushed, and I encourage the applicants to reapply after some more time to build a road map or even consider an incubation with SES. EuroDAI would be very valuable, but it would be such a critical product that it probably needs active assistance from veteran PE members, and a plan for the maintenance of that new product \u2013 it has the potential to be so valuable that we really need to get execution correct the first time. But this needs an articulated way to hand off new products without abandonment or adding them to the PE Core Unit\u2019s duties. Yes for MIP59 (DssCharter). I think this one is fairly uncontroversial, especially given my support for the Nexo Institutional Vault. No for Content MKT-001 budget proposal. I have been reviewing a number of budget proposals more closely, and those that are consistently coming in under budget just need to do some tweaking. Content appears to have in excess of 56k DAI on hand, and an undrawn 71k DAI in streamed support, and will be fine with a delayed budget. I apologize for not giving this more attention when it was still in RFC, but anticipate a revised budget will not impact their operations. Yes for Growth GRO-001 budget proposal. I have only closely inspected the bottom-line total, which seems reasonable for the deliverables Growth continues to provide. ",

Even with things as they currently are, I\u2019m not sure how a policy of Abstain vs Vote Against is better than Vote For vs Vote Against. It only makes it more likely that good collateral type gets accidentally rejected at this stage because a small number of voters vote against it while large holders like delegates abstain. Does this change your mind on abstaining from all greenlight polls (unless the collateral is terrible) as a standard policy? Happy to chat about this and see how to fix it, both in the short and long-term. ",

This is with the assumption and strong desire to see Deco operate in an architecture such that users are not interacting with yield tokens that are not their own (hedging their own vault) rather than available on the open market for speculation. This is, of course, as a conservative, precautionary stance towards regulating entities (such as the SEC) that would trigger a legal need for AML/KYC. We want to give these regulatory agencies a wide berth. While this may hamper the possible applications of Deco Protocol, I am now convinced that it is flexible enough to operate within these boundaries in a way that can still add value to Maker. ",

There is also some non-public information that also influenced the decision to sit on the sidelines for this one. Field Technologies voted Abstain from green light polls for CSC and TM2-DROP. These polls seem to be vestigial and unnecessary. I look forward to learning more about both proposals as risk assessments come in and discussion picks up. Field Technologies voted Yes to the green light poll for OFH (the SocGen proposal) out of an abundance of caution that our governance process not inadvertently derail this deal. Field Technologies voted Yes for the latest MOMC proposals. They were uncontroversial and have already passed. ",

This is literally the kind of thing I had requested funding for in the compensation poll that was defeated last week (which had $10k earmarked to get legal services). Note that we have had CUs come back for multiple proposal iterations in the past. So the stakes for a defeat are most likely to be that of delay. I share your frustration, believe me.

No. GFX will receive compensation based on their average delegated MKR over the rest of the month. If tomorrow an MKR holder delegates them 20k MKR then this will be taken into account.

This is similar to the ETH-B vault type, and the rapidly increasing exposure of Maker to WBTC makes it worthwhile to offer different levels of leverage to different users. This should also provide diversification of timing of liquidations in a sudden downturn. GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A Parameter Adjustments Yes.

NS-DROP Covenant Modification No. These requests may be reasonable. But increasing exposure or concentration in Centrifuge assets should be on hold until the upgraded legal framework is in place. Recognised Delegate Compensation Increase Yes. If Maker wants delegates who are actually informed, it will need to compensate for the immense amount to time spent on communication, education, and investigation. Increase the WSTETH-A Debt Ceiling Yes. This is a new collateral type that has been very popular. Deferring to PE and Risk, it seems safe to increase our exposure to this ilk, especially as it carries a higher yield to offset risk above and beyond ETH. DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Parameter Adjustments Yes.

People are important, too. Secure, Sustainable and Scalable Systems.  Importance of Data Analytics to Goal achievement and problem solving.  Delegation Statement My service to Maker involves the following commitments:  In good and bad economic times, look out for the all the important Maker work-economic stakeholders (MKR holders, vault owners, DAI holder and users, MakerDAO, DeFI in general etc.). To looking at the system of Maker from both the internal microcosms of contracts, people, operations to the greater macrocosms of DeFI and the real world in terms of governance, law, and finance. To creating Safe, Scalable and Sustainable Systems as Simply and Efficiently as possible. To growing Maker in a way that is Sustainable for the long term. To use Data driven analytics to drive decision-making to achieve goals.  Look towards the future by analyzing the past and present.  I arrived at Maker just as the transition from Single Collateral DAI (SCD/SAI) to MultiCollateral DAI (MCD/DAI) was occuring in November 2019.  My goals are to consistently to ask the hard questions, look towards building a sustainable future, and doing this by looking at the system from the perspectives of all players using any and all available data.   My ideas tend not to be implemented immediately because they break the mold of the \u2018what-are-we-doing-today\u2019 mentality that almost every organization I have been a part of does.   Therefore, I look for the things that yield the greatest return in the shortest time for the least cost that is good for all stakeholders and the entire ecosystem.   I see Maker as rapidly approaching the scale of many smaller nations financially, and so it is going to have to work at a fully international scale and view to navigate deep and difficult waters as it grows from 10B to 1T in assets under management.  Maker desperately needs a diverse set of greater minds to focus efforts, both to be efficient, effective and forward thinking.   In the highly competitive crypto/defi environment Maker needs to move faster, do it more efficiently, and above all, be willing to be first. This will mean some possible mis-steps, and some potential losses, but with proper management, Maker can continue to stand as a key leader and mover in the fast-paced blockchain Decentralized Finance space. My goals:   Grow Maker to becoming a $1T entity with a focus on anti-fragility, decentralization, reducing systemic and user risk, using data/analytics to drive goal achievement. Continue to work to drive Maker into being one of the most secure, reliable, fully transparent protocols in the space. Exemplify excellence, integrity, honesty, and openness in the space with action by looking at both the microcosm of the DAO and system of contracts, and Maker integration into the larger DeFI ecosystems as well as how it will integrate into greater Real World of assets, finance, law and politics.  My introduction to Maker was started with a new forum thread where I encouraged people to introduce themselves and to learn the Maker basics. Is there a thread here to welcome new forum members? leading to The Official Welcome Thread I have a few hundred posts on various topics related to my above core values above that can be reviewed here.    MakerMan    Joined September 14, 2019    Key highlights.   After BlackThursday(BT) the effects on vault owners were still not recognized.  I started up a thread for vault holders to vent, which lead to my work spearheading the Black Thursday Report for the community and an initiative regarding compensation for affected vault holders. https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-vault-owners-report-thread https://forum.makerdao.com/t/compensating-vault-holders-that-liquidated-at-0-bid https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-mcd-ethereum-system-liquidation-report-and-black-thursday-compensation-analysis While BT compensation failed to compensate affected vault owners, it allowed everyone in the community to speak and laid the issue to rest for the vast majority of the community. Hence was a success from this perspective. For various reasons, I burned out on the Maker community for a time and took a break. Without compensation at levels above my current employ, my ability to work will be limited to what is strictly necessary to steward over the Maker system to fulfill the above commitments.  As a delegate, I promise to be respectful even if I vehemently disagree with a view, listen to all parties no matter what their views, to be a fair decision maker, and open with my views.   Good data or cogent argument can and will change my mind on any topic.  I also pledge near 100% poll participation unless acts of God interviene.  I will stand by all executives to secure the system unless I have strong opposition toward them, in which case, I will make my views publicly known. Potential Conflicts and Alignments of interest.  I have a vault and typically borrow from time to time. I am a MKR owner my ownership percentage is small relative to my total portfolio. I do hold DAI most times in various contracts. Not employed by Maker Foundation or MakerDAO and hold no position in the DAO.  Income from Maker (DAI)  4K for the BT report (5/2020) 6.3K for work on the BT compensation group. (1/2021) 8.4K via SourceCred DAI rewards. (inception to current.)  Finally will do my best to communicate with the community regarding my views and positions on upcoming polls and executives, make myself available via e-mail and private forum communication.  I also agree to the Maker delegate Code of Conduct https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct as posted 20210816. Waver of liability.

People seem to be concerned over legislation.  I know a number of players in the US cannibus industry.   This industry is not going away and have growing lobbying power due to the growing financial size of the industry and growth potential.  Put simply cannibus for decades has been a lost business opportunity not just due to the significant medical benefits, but also the recreational use aspect.  If we manage DC and risk via SF there shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  My only issue with these DROP/Tinlake structures is I am not seeing a clear legal analysis of the contract structures as I am of the 6s structures.   I hope that we control these DCs until we get a solid legal opinion/analysis report on the DROP/TinLake legal structures by independent legal consultants. A general note here. I will try to put up my \u201cIntended vote positions\u201d as early as possible so supporters and detractors can make their cases to me here for a possible vote change.  I also want anyone delegating to me to be able to see my intended vote and make their case for why they are supportive or against my position. ",

Update on DROP/TinLake.     On-Chain Securitization Roadmap / New Silver audit Real World Finance   Summary This roadmap is based on an initial review of the New Silver Tinlake legal structure by Shearman & Sterling and from our own internal monthly audit process. It provides action points that will lead to a secure on-chain securitization mechanism.   Motivation The initial DAI generated by MakerDAO for RWA was done on April, 21th and invested through New Silver DROP for real-estate bridge financing. Since then, we are now at 6M DAI invested in RWA. We enjoyed significant PR and first-mover \u2026     I think given the still open issues here it would be prudent to limit DC until critical path legal structure contract issues are settled. Stance on MKR Compensation and CU compensation generally is that Maker should move to a model where full competitive salaries are paid in DAI, and MKR is given as a bonus in direct relation to the DAI protocol revenue during the periods of interest.  If MKR doesn\u2019t make money contractors shouldn\u2019t get bonuses, but in every case no matter if MKR protocol makes 0 DAI, worst case Maker should flop MKR to raise DAI to cover contractor salaries in DAI.    Goal here is a clear optics by CUs building their own longer term DAI reserves so they have good handle on at least 1 and preferrably 3 years of contractor budget into the future.  Put simply if MKR compensation is strictly a bonus compensation that is tied to protocol making net positive DAI revenue this is both good for contractors (known terms) and for the protocol (by not giving out MKR bonus compensation when protocol is losing money) is Sustainable into the indefinite future.  This model fully aligns both contractor needs and bonus incentives between all stakeholders. ",

                    "content": "Poll votes: Flash loan fee to 0 - yes. Solar x Proposal - no. I want to be clear.  I want to see more solar proposals, but ideally these should be brownfield developments not greenfield ones, or converting roofs of large building complexes in cities, where ever.   Also I would like to see these more concentrated in the southwest.  I welcome the proposer to bring more projects but would encourage them to have some skin in the game.   The land owner being \u2018part of the project\u2019 just means everyone else is laying off the land risk part of the deal on someone else. I don\u2019t see the players have sufficient investment stake or commitment.   From what I hear the only reason they are proposing this deal to Maker is to \u2018make more money\u2019 because they could have sold it to blackrock.  So if I don\u2019t care about the merits, sustainability and I just want to beat blackrock to some nice deal I might just say yes.   Unfortunately beating blackrock to win a project isn\u2019t my sole reason. I come back to core principles stated in my platform. Sustainability Integrity Stakeholder recognition The reasons I am saying no to Solar X project are as follows: Not sustainable  Greenfield solar development the least sustainable model.   There are many better places one can do solar developments (brown fields, large buildings, deserts, anywhere but highly prized farmland needed for food production).  See a 2008 article from Scientific American which shows what I believe is the best plan for the US to move forward sustainably on Solar energy.   At the time this article came out the US government response was too costly and therefore not politically viable.   Since then the US debt has grown another 15T (still growing btw) with the \u2018infrastructure bill\u2019 tossing another $1T over 10 years and a paltry 65B of that to upgrade the US electrical grid and invest in renewables far short of what is really needed and clearly not what is suggested in the SA article.    Scientific American    A Solar Grand Plan By 2050 solar power could end U.S. dependence on  foreign oil and slash greenhouse gas emissions         World Resources Institute    US Infrastructure Bill Is Good, but Not Enough to Transform the Electricity Grid The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684) is a good start, but doesn't invest enough in modernizing the grid and deploying clean energy.      As is usual government falls far short on planning, finances and political will to do the right thing. Given well respected scientists have given a vision for the future now 13 years ago.  Government, and Maker would do well to reject what is not sustainable, and support what is.   Stakeholder recognition   When I started researching the pros and cons of converting farmland into solar I found quite a bit of community political backlash which makes one wonder not just if this is a good idea generally but whether this is something communities want.   (will fill with links later - but I found enough articles, references, referendums, and communities strongly against various proposals to be concerned zoning would not be granted on this but if one searches one can find anything.  My problem was this stuff came out rapidly not in some extended digging).   One thing I will say given political connections with significant experience in these zoning arenas is that there have been many cases where a whole community has been completely against a project and the project was still passed by the elected officials to the utter dismay of the people.    Ask a question - why if this project was so good would the farmer continue to farm part of the property and transform the rest.  If this was so wonderful for the community and they were welcoming to this would the farmer and developer even bother to farm part of this property.?   All of this is contingent on permit approval.  Not entirely clear to me what happens to this loan if this doesn\u2019t materialize.   I have other concerns and think Maker can pick better projects (particularly in solar) and what is worse if we signal to RWF that we will take on any old project and put up not even the slightest hesitation on any of these(for any reason) that Maker will find it self dealing with a deluge of projects with higher and higher risk eventually putting the system at risk.

I have some issues with coupling MKR rewards to salary vs. bonuses and would like a more sustainable approach to these rewards models that decouples MKR bonus from salaries proper.  I also have general concerns over a massively growing Maker system cost via growing CUs and growing CU budgets.  For now I am going to let this run, and then deal with the issue when revenues do not meet expenditures\u2026  Lets just hope we can continue to grow DAI and revenues from it. More later\u2026 ",

This might not seem like a big deal but every little bit counts.   In fact I would feel much better getting to 25,000 MKR via 100 or 1000 or more people.   Feel free to comment here or private message me with issues, concerns, ideas as this will help me be a better delegate. This in conjunction with my own work on MKR governance participation rewards gave me some interesting ideas.    I now have my hands on some data thank you to @tmierzwa for looking into the quality of the data and getting me datasets so I can do some governance analysis that hopefully will lead to some nice governance analytics and a State of MakerDAO governance report.

Intention is to vote yes to onboard Gelato USDC-DAI as a collateral type. Intention is to vote yes to Adopt the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for PSM-PAX-A.   I want to make a single statement about the PSMs in general.   The PSM was only intended to be a short term approach to dealing with DAI PEG and provide DAI liquidity.   My understanding also is that during an ES these will no longer function, oracles on prices are permanently set to 1 (basically disabled).  A solid PEG might be good for developing business but when I examine the price fluctuations of all other stablecoins - not one has a PEG as tight as DAI.   This is a very strong constraint and in conjunction with my post on the Maker Trilemma - ala Impossible Trinity means Maker must follow market rates or face a carry trade driving capital into or out of the PSMs should Maker rates diverge from Market.  Limitations on collateral in the future could have significant implications for the PEG generally (both up and down).   This also has strong implications regarding any and all fixed rate proposals and Institutional Vaults Intention is to vote yes to Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit Budget Q4 2021 to Q1 2022 (MIP40c3-SP29). Intention is to vote yes to Ratification Poll for Risk Core Unit MKR Compensation (MIP40c3-SP25). I am decidedly against including retroactive rewards on a CU by CU basis as these should be pooled together so everyone can be treated fairly.   I also believe MKR rewards should be bonuses related to system performance-profit to be sustainable. Intention is to vote yes to Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (MIP40c3-SP31). Intention is to vote yes to Ratification Poll for Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, CES-001.  Given that Maker intentions for growth are RWA and Institutional Vaults I have some concerns of overlap between CUs but I am convinced duplication of effort is a potential quality assurance.  I have stated in the past to get both competition and quality in a decentralized business will cost 2-3x more than in a centralized business.   There are key issues with having a single CU or group of individuals solely responsible for carrying on DAO functions.   Single sourcing in any business for services is generally bad and leads to higher costs and greater inefficiencies.   The best model is to actually offer up tasks for bid and to seek ways to develop a healthy market for sources for business services.   There are many reasons a decentralized entity should be looking to create such a model.  Here we can do it by having additional CUs with overlapping functions. I intend to abstain from Ratification Poll for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001. I don\u2019t have any real informational background on why this CU is necessary, nor whether anyone else can carry on its services should this unit go dark or offline. I intend to vote yes to Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit, DUX-001. So far work of this unit looks good.  I would like to see some development of a broader market for services as stated above. I intend to vote yes to Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001.  I like the idea of generating both PR and someone keeping an eye on general status of the DAO from a satisfaction standpoint.  I think the return for the cost likely will be higher than expected but intend to monitor approach.  It would be interesting for this unit to develop polls, and/or measurement metrics to monitor status using a scientific data driven approach. I intend to abstain Ratification Poll for RWA Foundations (MIP58) . My concern here is that while this appears reasonable, it also appears to duplicate a number of efforts of our RWA\u2019s.   There is no real analysis presented as to how this MIP potentially could conflict with not just other MIPs as @PaperImperium suggests, nor a co-ordinated statement from our currently onboarded RWAs as to whether this structure negatively or positively impinges on their own already created structures.   In short I don\u2019t have a good handle on why this is necessary, or whether it affects current RWAs or is just looking to provide a framework for future RWAs. 20210914_0707 Update.

                    "content": "I voted yes to  Offboard USDT Collateral Types - September 27, 2021 . I voted yes to  Community Greenlight Poll - SB-DDC (Solid Block Detox Digital Coins) - September 20, 2021 . A comment here.  I agree with other delegates that I think how we are using greenlighting polls are such that in \u2018most cases\u2019 (see below) I am going to greenlight something so we can have this reviewed by CU teams before I am going to be able to say yes or no.   In general I think there is a productivity hazard here.   That if we basically greenlight everything it means CUs will have to do more work before governance can be informed enough to approve/deny a MIP6 application in particular.    There is another hazard that MIP6\u2019s once worked on will be expected to be approved otherwise the work will be a waste, so there will be a tendency to approve these vs. denying them   I think this kind of workflow has a conflict of interest between productivity lost vs tendency to approve (so work done isn\u2019t wasted).   Some discussion around intentions for MIP6 greenlighting and initial work by CUs to only bring forward MIP6 candidates that governance can pass, vs. just bringing forward any and everything hoping somehow where bad candidates will be weeded out before the final approval stage is probably appropriate. Which brings me to the next one I seriously was considering voting no on. I abstained on  Community Greenlight Poll - REIF-DROP (Commercial Real Estate Assets DROP) - September 20, 2021  like a large number of delegates (notice this one only passed because of one delegate @Planet_X with sufficient MKR voting power - there was another supporter @flipflopflapdelegate so it could have only taken two with combined 10K MKR if I remember right the amount needed to pass.)  This is mostly because most delegates like myself voted to abstain.    The primary issue here is this is a MIP6 related to adding more New Silver Centrifuge assets where @SebVentures has already flagged issues with an audit On-Chain Securitization Roadmap / New Silver audit - #5 by g_dip that as far as I know still have not been addressed. Looking at how basically a single delegate basically can greenlight whatever they want here brings up a delegation hazard.  I have often wondered whether delegates should only be allowed to have some maximum MKR delegated to them.  The idea we could get one delegate with 50K or more MKR doesn\u2019t seem as appealing as forcing this 50K MKR to spread between a number of delegates.   More on this later\u2026 Other notes.   A 3 day poll came up that I missed due to two family situations.  I would hope that in the future we could have every poll have at least a 7 day period as 3 days is likely too short if someone has family or health issues. I missed the following poll  Increase the System Surplus Buffer - September 20, 2021 . I read the discussion here and have long been an advocate for increasing surplus buffer to at least 2-5% of outstanding DAI.   One point I found interesting made by @cmooney    [Signal Request] Adjust the Surplus Buffer (September 2021)   flaps during market pullback are not accidental. When they happen, they support the MKR price in a market downturn. As MKR falls, the protocol buys it back supporting the price. The only risk I see is that we flap too much. That is, that the keeper market isn\u2019t strong enough to support a large number of flaps. I would also say that people should check reddit for the PR fallout from not burning. If we are going to take a pure growth approach, that should be articulated continuously to MKR holders as actions like this are breaking the MKR burn narrative. Minimally, this is the reason for lerping to these targets, it is the compromise with MKR holders that want a burn and those that don\u2019t.   Buying while markets are dropping via using some fraction of the liquidation fees is really a great way to continue to burn.    I would support a proposal to take some fraction (25-50%) of liquidations and flop with it. It was the when the whole CU MKR compensation came up and enhanced by the whole legal issues around minting MKR for the compensation vest to cause me to consider altering the MKR buy and burn behavior for multiple reasons.   A brief outline of what I have been considering proposing below. I asked in various places (and now here) whether it would be possible @makerburn to get a chart of DAI the system has earned as a function of time since inception of the MCD system.    What I am considering proposing is:  Change when the system flaps MKR to using a signal like liquidations to use DAI profits earned in the period to buy MKR.  Once this signal triggers: Provided DAI earnings are positive and doesn\u2019t put the SB below some low water mark.  Take some fraction F1 of DAI profit earned by the system in the period window and allocating it to buy back MKR (call this total MKR bought = BM). BM is used to fill required MKR vesting schedules for all CUs during the period etc.    Lets say during the period the system bought 100MKR but 200MKR is needed to fill the vesting schedules.   Then during this period this 100MKR would be split at a 50% level to all vesting schedules and a vesting deficit of 100MKR recorded.  If for example the BM for the period was 400MKR then I would want to fill the vesting schedule with 200MKR and guaranteed burn some fraction of the extra 200 (say 50% which would be 100MKR here) and then set aside the remaining 100MKR into a MKR vesting fund to fill any future vesting holes via some vesting deficit filling model.  Doing (1-3) above accomplishes a number of key goals for Maker.  Makes the MKR compensation vesting system - sustainable long term. Ties all MKR vesting to system profits.  When the system doesn\u2019t make DAI - no-one gets any MKR (they just build up vesting deficits to be made up later when the system earns more or partially filled via a MKR vesting deficit fund increased when system profits were high in the past.) Some MKR is purchased on the market based on the Fraction F1 of the DAI profits rather than a fixed SB buffer limit.   This will basically set the MKR price for vesting for the period as well vs. using some made up number based on average price for the period.  It will be an actual cost to the system in DAI which matches the DAI value given the the compensation via the vest. Completely eliminates ever having to mint MKR for vesting schedule. If MKR purchased exceeds the MKR vested there is a guaranteed burn component. Aligns the interests of everyone for the system to be profitable.   No-one gets their full vest component unless the system earns enough DAI to purchase enough MKR to fill the vest, and then and only then will the system guarantee burning some MKR no matter what the SB buffer level is.   (this behavior can be altered if the SB buffer gets too low btw). If the SB ever hits the high water mark then basically all MKR purchased goes through to vest and build a buffer to vest and some fraction will burn.  (this will be a reason to just punch the SB up to a reasonable large maximum value as a % of the outstanding DAI and just leave it there permanently). Part of the 84K MKR can be put into the vesting accumulator to provide for an initial MKR deficit filling fund.  ",

(20211001) https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-offboarding-usdt-collateral-core-unit-budget-distributions-october-1-2021?network=mainnet#proposal-detail Regarding the following polls: I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP37) - October 11, 2021. So far work of this unit looks good. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) - October 11, 2021. I have a general concern over expenditure growth, headcount additions, CU applications.   Put simply all we have here is DAO looking over the larger picture and us basically all doing it on our own.  Maker desperately needs an oversight unit which I would honestly prefer being delegate based since delegates are the most informed and the voting DAO the ultimate responsibility. I voted yes to Ratification Poll for Implementation of DSS Charter (MIP59) - October 11, 2021. Really want to get going with Nexo and other IV users for next 12 months until DAO can get a more global IV solution model constructed that coupled performance commitment with a refundable bond and to think more about how to manage \u2018DAI policy\u2019 against or last remaining control knob \u2018rates\u2019.   This is even more important now that legislators are looking at return instruments where regulators/legislators may take away the DSR knob from the DAO. I voted [yes to Ratification Poll for Adding MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) - October 11, 2021(https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmV44i6E?network=mainnet#poll-detail).  Thank you @Nadia for chiming in so I could support this.  (MIP39c2-SP21: Adding MakerLabs Core Unit - #14 by MakerMan) I voted [yes to Ratification Poll for Adding Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001) - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmR7fMc6?network=mainnet#poll-detail)  I am excited to see this CU get off the ground and to work with @tmierzwa  to produce analytics not just useful for Maker but all other DAOs and to possibly turn this unit into a profitable enterprise for Maker.  @tmierzwa has already provided me with governance data I am working to digest to produce a kind of GovAlpha report and responds very quickly to data requests.    I am buried in other paperwork at the moment and hope to complete the coding work to be able to put the GovAlpha data into a more report friendly form to produce a report in the next 4-8 weeks. I voted [NO to Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) - October 11, 20211] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmZyjR4t?network=mainnet#poll-detail) - There are multiple reasons I am against all the fixed rate solutions being offered.  Maker doesn\u2019t get out of the Impossible Trinity as I have discussed in multiple places. Maker over short periods can take on the rate risk and doesn\u2019t need to lay off the rate difference. Given legislators are looking hard at crypto instruments that both define a return and those that make a claim on assets and are likely to come down on these as securities.  Let others offer these fixed rate instruments and deal with regulatory uncertainty and burden.  I have nothing against the team here just from the way I am looking at this Maker protocol doesn\u2019t need to recode for fixed rates anything, governance simply has to make a commitment to them and honor those commitments.    BTW:  There is nothing about laying off these fixed rate instruments that will help us with DAI policy here with respect to the Impossible Trinity issue as DAI can\u2019t be manufactured by anyone except a user with collateral deposited into the protocol (at least for the time being). I voted [yes to Community Greenlight Poll - CurveLP-stETH-ETH (Curve stETH-ETH LP Token) - October 4, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmd1qpHU?network=mainnet#poll-detail)  Unless I am missing something this just looks like another ETH vault but it has return so basically looks reasonable.  My concern here is we are going to do this work and find this vault doesn\u2019t mint much DAI but willing to give it a chance. I voted [yes to Increase the GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A Debt Ceiling - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmU6fTQx?network=mainnet#poll-detail)  - absolute yes here as this fits my ( DAO DeepLiquidity - 1Hive) Thesis  where Maker should be looking to add significant MC projects via Token-DAI Uniswap V2 type LP.   I am working on a proposal to work with our Institutional Vaults here to encourage them to create (for example) NEXO-DAI UNISWAP V2 LP and Maker to add such a vault so NEXO could pair with DAI and mint more DAI using their own token as an additional way for their users to get return on owning NEXO and for the DEX NEXO trading liquidity to be as deep as possible.  Right now there is <3M of total Uniswap NEXO liquidity. Uniswap Info   Imagine if there was 100-200M NEXO-DAI LP. I voted [yes to Add the Aave Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmexUjoD?network=mainnet#poll-detail) - I need to look at this more carefully but saw no reason to say no to this atm.  Still reviewing. I voted [yes to PaperImperium Supplemental Compensation - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmdmeUjv?network=mainnet#poll-detail) - please see my comments in the thread.   Two key points here.  I think this sets a bad precedent generally and MakerDAO should consider having a above and beyond recognition grant award that requires a nominator and nominee and 1 supporter or some other model to handle acknowledging and rewarding people for recognized significant contributions. I voted [yes to Nexo Institutional Vault Onboarding - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmU41X9v?network=mainnet#poll-detail) - While I want to see some changes to details of these IV deals and believe there is an understanding terms on these are likely to change in 12 months I am highly supportive of NEXO.  I have been a long time NEXO user and really like what they are doing.  They are a great addition and partner to the protocol.  I honestly would love to see some cross investing here if it could be done (MakerDAO vote to swap some MKR for some NEXO and NEXODAO do the same).   This would assure cross commitments.   Expect more on how to develop these cross DAO relationships to Building DAOnetworks -  Ideas - 1Hive specifically for Maker from me in the future. I voted [yes to Add stETH (Lido Staked ETH) as a new Vault Type - October 11, 2021] (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXXHpYi?network=mainnet#poll-detail) - I think interest bearing instruments are the way to go, but be cautioned there may be regulatory hurdles here.  Frankly I consider these kinds of instruments to be the future of collateral. Thats about it for me for now.   I am hoping to stay on top of votes and now that I have switched to a Ledger for voting hopefully this will keep my gas low. One general comment at the end here.   I keep wondering if GovAlpha job is to basically vet proposals so they pass governance I wonder what the real job of governance here is after the fact.  What exactly are we supposed to \u2018stop\u2019 that we might not stop.   I have a general concern that the system is basically designed to rubber stamp things once they get through certain governance stages so I wonder exactly where governance is supposed to stop a proposal since once a proposal makes it to polling or executive the expectation is it should pass. Is the place where governance scrutiny supposed to be the highest on poll discussion?  If so we need to formalize this as the place to have the hard discussion, to do the hardest vetting, because once we pass this hurdle the reasoning to say no to something becomes more difficult. I am also rapidly coming to the conclusion that MakerDAO governance side (from the delegate and governance voters) needs its own CU unit to provide us with analysis and information.  It is getting harder to do this from my own seat.  The idea I can do proper governance quality assurance and not become a rubber stamp without assistance is growing more and more ludricous given the sheer number of \u2018polling\u2019 and discussion activities going on. I don\u2019t know about other delegates but it is easy to become overwhelmed and just say yes to something because it is easy vs. getting into \u2018debate\u2019 trying to find a reason to stop something.  It becomes tiring to be the \u2018bad guy\u2019 so everyone else can beat up on you just to try to tease out potential issues for the DAO. ",

RWA Strategy Update - Being more strategic Real World Finance       I have been saying this for almost the past 1.5 years.   That you can\u2019t get to 1B 10M at a time (adding various tokens vs. being focused and improving ETH and wBTC deposits - which still has not been a focus), nor can you get to 1T easily at even 1B at a time.    Primary goal I think for the protocol is to get as much DAI out there as possible.  This along with PEG management is priority #1 (at least from the CUs I talk to).    Earning a decent return for the risk taken on is probably priority \u2026     A few notes.  Was sorry to see @PaperImperium supplimental compensation proposal dropped.   It is likely we will lose him and his incredible energy.   I believe the DAO can do better by taking .1% of MC or 1000MKR value equivalent and reward all governance participants equally based on governance wallet participation metrics.   Use something like a 50% pass through to delegates on this reward and we can both encourage small MKR holders to delegate, and compensate delegates as well as everyone with a linear, vesting reward component related to MKR MC.    I believe if we want to compensate for governance participation we should reward it based on what the protocol needs.  Assumption here is that delegates that don\u2019t must sufficient MKR will move aside for those who can, and that everyone based on their participation level in governance should have access to same rewards level.  delegates presumably will have very high participation so this would be a way for small MKR holders to get governance exposure, earn 50% rewards level and not have to pay gas except for their first transaction.

My concern is that raising the ES it basically makes MKR mostly unable to act in a reasonable time if necessary, and the GSM it is not clear to me whether this number needs to be 2, 4, or 7 days honestly and this coupled with a basic analysis of how long it would take to muster 75, 100, 125 or 150K makes me want to throw this back for discussion so we can get better consensus on what actual values and why. I voted Yes to [  Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial - October 25, 2021] - I have been torn on this. bouncing from abstain, to yes, to no, to yes again.  I am aware of the significant conflict of interest in voting yes here.   When I personally thought about it as a small MKR holder, even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate I would be voting my MKR as yes on this proposal.  Why?  Because I think even 48K/yr isn\u2019t that much for what delegates are expected to do and every time I turn my own competing compensation proposal I end up with similar numbers. My own proposal involves rewarding ALL governance participants a fee for their vote from a rough allocation of 1000MKR/yr value to compensate all poll and executive voters. I come up with similar compensation (from 30-120K/yr) for delegates or governance participants with 5-10K MKR and near 100% participation. BTW if 1000MKR is the reward value for a years worth of governance (.1% MC cost/yr btw) (2.3M as of today) and 50K MKR is in governance this works out to a 2% return to that 50K, and a .5% return to 200K MKR.    I think this is really cheap price for decent governance.   BTW 2.3M spread across 10 delegates is 230K/yr at 20 is 115K/yr and at 50 is 46K/yr. Hence the numbers in the above proposal are probably low and any proposal that compensates all MKR voting in governance on a price per MKRvote is going to land at a similar cost value for the DAO - 2.4-4.8M/yr or 200-400K/month to muster between 50 and 200K MKR to participate in governance. Last note.   I think MakerDAO needs to offer compensation for governance, this is a function only MKR holders can provide and when laid against returns for cost here I think even 1000 MKR value is cheap when compared to the relative importance of the return to the system.   1Hive pays over 10%/yr for HNY holders in celeste (about .5% inflation on total float) to offer themselves up to render judgements on disputes in celeste. It costs people ETH to even vote (I paid $30 in ETH fees just to post the above votes). ",

                    "content": "I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this. I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:  Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal. Simple governance compensation proposal that aligns and satisfies governace participation goals. Use a reward bounty per poll and per executive.  10MKR/executive 2MKR/poll delegation split - bounty split equally between a delegate and delegator. Rewards can be paid out after the poll or executive closes and can be paid in DAI or MKR.  The value equivalent should be in in MKR but could also be a fixed value in DAI.  I used MKR because it was easier to think about this from a MKR inflation perspective as a system cost and as a APY/ROI on MKR performing a service.  If we take 200polls/yr and 50 executives we end up with 900MKR being allocated for governance rewards with above scheme (or 2.07M $$ equivalent value, not a lot when compared to CUs and given the importance of governance in the system - particular with executives). What the actual bounties are can be debated.  I chose the above numbers because then one can work out math to determine what returns look like. Some calculations using above numbers to put this proposal into perspecitve. Return on 50K MKR with 100% participation using above proposed numbers. .004% return/poll .02% return/executive or maximum .8%/yr return doing all polls (or 400MKR) maximum 1%/yr return for doing all executives (or 500MKR) 900MKR currently worth 2.07M 50K MKR 100% participation   Delegated MKR Total Delegate Holders \t2.3K/MKR   20K 360 180 180 828K   10K 180 90 90 414K   5K 90 45 45 207K   1K 18 9 9 41.35K   100 1.8 .9 .9 4.135K   100K MKR 100% participation   Delegated MKR Total Delegate Holders \t2.3K/MKR   20K 180 90 90 414K   10K 90 45 45 207K   5K 45 22.5 22.5 103.5K   1K 11 5.5 5.5 20.7K   100 1.1 .55 .55 2.07K   200K MKR 100% participation   Delegated MKR Total Delegate Holders \t2.3K/MKR   20K 90 45 45 207K   10K 45 22.5 22.5 103.5K   5K 22.5 11.25 11.25 51.75K   1K 4.5 2.25 2.25 10.35K   100 .45 .225 .225 1.035K   I have gas costs at current rate on above at 100% participation to be roughly 2K on polls and 4K on executives. A number of people have wanted to skew these numbers away from one particular holder getting too much reward and others to get too little.  Given the Hat mechanics in particular I believe doing anything other than a fully linear to MKR being voted reward will simply cause people to separate their MKR when what we want to see (this is particularly true) is MKR to congregate.   If anything we should encourage MKR to congregate by adding a small MKR size bonus.  Skew or no skew in rewards has in general been contentious and it complicates the proposal.  I leave this as is due to leave the simplicity intact. What the above accomplishes.  Very simple easy to understand model for rewards. Complete easy control over governance rewards as a budget. Easy straightforwards way to compensate delegates. Completely fair rewards to all governance participants, shadow or just plain MKR holders. Encourages smaller holders to delegate MKR gas compensation for governance participation MKR gets returns from other protocols for providing liquidity why not in governance.   There is sigificant precident for offering a return for liquidity. The rate of return based on above numbers IS NOT that high. Should be relatively easy to implement. If there is issue with delegates or individuals with too much MKR - then simply cap rewards to them (which will only force them to divide their wallets).  We can control this for delegates but not for MKR generally.  In this way we can control how much MKR a single delegate can control as well as their compensation. Rewards increase when participation decreases, and decrease when participation increases. Rewards are only given when a vote is made hence the above model automatically tracks participation. Rewards for polls and for executives independently controlled. The above model is exceedingly simple in concept and aligns incentives generally. The gas, rewards breakeven cutoff is roughly in the 100MKR range which is about right given MKR distribution (80-85% of all MKR is held in wallets with 100MKR or higher).  The remaining 15% in smaller amounts likely would delegate.   Wallets with below 1MKR I don\u2019t believe would cost benefit the system (cost to enter and rewards distribution costs probably would outweigh the return) Above numbers targeted 100K MKR participation  The biggest issues around this will be:  Contract implementation for how to distribute rewards in delegation contracts and cost profiles to collect/disribute rewards. Past politics around governance compensation. (whether to be linear to MKR or not, or whether to do it at all).  ",

People believe this is good, when in fact it is likely to lead to negative market and liquidity implications.  Interestingly this move counterintuitively might actually decrease the DAI in circulation vs. increase it  I believe we need to go to 20tin/tout and slightly increase the spread. ** Community Greenlight Poll - MDI (MD Irradiance LLC) - November 1, 2021** - abstained becuase I agree with @PaperImperium in that some thinking about how MakerDAO handles greenlight polls is appropriate.  I honestly would rather CUs be the ones to bring these forward or stop them.   I don\u2019t want to consider things unless one or MORE CUs has co-sponsored a proposal for the DAO. ** Community Greenlight Poll - OHM (Olympus DAO) - November 1, 2021** - I had to think a lot about this poll.   I am not convinced Olympus products (OHM) are sustainable at this time.  Perhaps in a 3-6 months I may change my view.  I also just believe that Maker needs to focus on onboarding collateral and vaults that can lead to B\u2019s of DAI minted with the least correlated risk exposures.  The fact that OHM is already using DAI heavily is something to monitor carefully. ",

                    "content": "Delegate Communication: Executive blocking vote: ** Parameter Changes, Core Unit Budget Distribution - November 5, 2021 ** - I am voting my 5K MKR on on the ** MOMC Proposal, August Core Unit Budgets, Housekeeping - August 6, 2021 ** proposal to attempt to block the current PSM tin/tout set to 0 by taking my 5K away from supporting current Executive and supporting an old Executive raising the needed MKR to pass current Exec to 51.65K MKR. Reasons are straightforward and as follows:  Setting PSM tin/tout 0 signals that Maker wants DAI price below 1 and when the PSMs empty it is going to swift.   We are already down almost 1B in 30 days on the USDC PSM.  If this isn\u2019t a wake up call to MakerDAO I don\u2019t know what is. If more PSMs are added Maker will become the defacto Monopoly stablecoin trading platform where all Maker PSM stablecoin prices (regardless of risk) will trade at $1.   USDP and USDC will be the first to have locked prices.   IF for any reason there is a market loss event that is traced to Maker price fixing stablecoins via the PSMs it likely will lead to the end of Maker and DAI. PSM spread to zero will basically eliminate stablecoin trading fees in vaults like GUNIV3USDCDAI etc.   I would rather us open up the tin/tout to 20bps and these trading markets to get more liquidity and be more robust than killing stablecoin trading on curve and uniswap in one fell swoop by taking away trading fees.   This may take a while for markets to digest but in time it will. If this still passes it will mean a greater agreement with MKR holders to support this.  Hopefully causing people to consider more carefully what MakerDAO gets from passing this, and what it hazards. Locking DAI PEG through stablecoins was originally intended to be an \u2018emergency\u2019 measure but has become the defacto method of choice to maintain the PEG.  Liquidity into and out of the sides of the DAI with some spread away from 1 IS critical.  We have used low price of 1 and high price > 1 at some point we will seriously want to consider bracketing a bracket < 1 and 1.  I have been just advocating we always have a fee away from 1 proper (both tin/tout > 5bps) vs. what this proposes =1 on both sides of the PEG.    tin/tout=0 setting will coil up the maximum possible financial energy should the PEG have any real financial reason to deviate from 1.(I have listed numerous ones).  Having a spread acts as a financial cushion, LP in pairings acts as the liquidity source(s) for immediate trading.  I want to be clear I am for everything else in this executive.  MOMC fee and parameter changes, core unit budget requests (even though I see many of these funding requests being high - I am pleased to see initiatives by various core units to return excess funds).   But I feel strongly enough to push those changes to next executive to stop the PSM tin/tout 0 from passing and being enacted. I don\u2019t like to use the MKR delegated to me to block a proposal but there are times when you are so sure something is wrong that you want to do everything reasonably possible to stop people from doing something that has a great potential to harm their own business and other people\u2019s livelihoods.   To be sure if this passes the effect probably won\u2019t happen immediately but when the PSMs are finally drain it will happen quickly and governance will not be able to act fast enough to stop the outflows and a PEG dropping rapidly below 1.

These types of vaults allow for a more staggered liquidation should prices drop. GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A Parameter Adjustments - November 8, 2021 - voted YES even though PSM tin/tout to 0 over time is going to kill fees here.   Mostly because I am expecting the DAI PEG to break 1 - and will bring fees back.   The use of this vault is going to depend heavily on whether Maker can maintain PEG at 1 or not and fees. NS-DROP Covenant Modification - November 8, 2021 - voted NO on these changes.   Simple upshot here is that while work is being done to correct issues with Centrifuge structure until the structures are more suitable for Maker (for example a senior secured credit agreement seat) there is a general consensus not to modify these to/and/or extend new credit.    There are significant issues going on with RWF in general well that are creating additional opacity making these difficult to deal with. Recognised Delegate Compensation Increase - November 8, 2021 - voted YES Even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate I would have voted my MKR for this.   I believe the work being done by delegates justifies the compensation.  I do believe given the level of compensation there should be a solid set of measurable requirements.   I am also concerned that there is no cap on MKR that can be delegated to a single delegate. Increase the WSTETH-A Debt Ceiling - November 8, 2021 - voted YES to the increase here.  We really want to encourage collateral that earns return. DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Parameter Adjustments - November 8, 2021 - voted YES to the increase here.  I have wanted Maker protocol to take advantage of earning return on DAI and this is one of many ways.  I do have concerns over implications on liquidity, security and if DAI runs off PEG. Executive:  Parameter Changes, Return Unused Budget to the Surplus Buffer - November 12, 2021 - Supported Increases GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A DC from 50 to 500M, decreases the LR to 102 - basically going to 50x leverage from 20x.   SF decreased from 1% to .5%.   I am positive on these types of vaults for multiple reasons.  One thing to point out is that this v3 liquidity is concentrated into a very narrow band.  If for any reason the PEG drops below this band this LP will earn no fees and people will need to reposition.  While unlikely to see a 200bps drop DAI below PEG here could cause this vault to become under collateralized.  Hence like all the stablecoin vaults that have stablecoin values PEGGED to 1 create some systemic risk should underlying stablecoin collateral drop significantly below $1 for any reason. WSETH-A DC increase - very much needed and likely will be used. AAVEV2-DAI Aave D3M - While there are some hazards at least the protocol is now earning fees using DAI in these DeFI projects.   About time honestly. It was nice to see some surplus budget returned tot he surplus buffer but as can be seen later there are some CU accounting issues to be addressed. Last notes. USDC PSM down over 250M in past 5 days.  Puts us on track to empty by year end. Also concerned over the turmoil going on within the RWA unit around @SebVentures and Cenrifuge slowing down RWA growth Beyond this we are about to hit top end of surplus buffer and DAI holding at 8B earning over 1% in aggregate. Upcoming Polls Community Greenlight Poll - MDI (MD Irradiance LLC) - November 1, 2021 - probably going to abstain as I agree with Paper the process around these greenlight polls needs to be changed. Community Greenlight Poll - OHM (Olympus DAO) - November 1, 2021 - still a No on Olympus OHM. Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) - November 8, 2021 - Honestly there are so many issues around Deco.   If this unit came on as a parallel PECO to work on what governance wanted and set aside this fixed rate stuff I would be more supportive.   Setting aside my issues around fixed rates:  Maker can fix rates all by itself. It doesn\u2019t need to do this in the protocol Maker by creating fixed rate instruments increases the likelihood of regulation being applied to the protocol. Won\u2019t do dink to get us out of the rate issues in the Impossible Trinity   Put simply this particular deal basically gives Deco a huge benefit from the protocol, while the protocol takes on all the risk.   No government, no institution would give away so much to get so little and take on such risk.  As structured Deco is a bad deal for Maker.   This idea that if we don\u2019t do it, DECO will be upset and take their marbles off the table is concerning to say the least.  It is as if some inside deal was done here and governance is just supposed to rubber stamp a yes.   I have various folks both inside and outside Maker lobbying me on both sides of this deal with valid reasonings.    I am still willing to hear a cogent argument for why this is good for Maker vs. what we lose if we don\u2019t do it.   I have never liked a business deal which was a lose-lose proposition if I didn\u2019t do it.   Tells me the deal is structured badly because in any good deal saying no just means things stay the same (no-one loses - we just don\u2019t gain). Ratification Poll for Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) - November 8, 2021 - Going to support with YES this.  Don\u2019t know what I ended up at the first time I looked for this but after finding this and reading it a resounding yes. Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) - November 8, 2021 - Leaning to YES here mostly based on discussions with other CUs etc.   We need to grow a bit more with manpower and this unit will manage some other key MakerDAO issues.  Really want to see expenses come in line.  Particularly the MKR vesting since we are seeing MKR being vested for unfilled positions in a number of CUs now. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP39) - November 8, 2021 - First glance is to support this because we really need RWA to get moving and I see this CU as needing really qualified and experienced people and these don\u2019t come cheap.  Honestly moving to side with PaperImperium here regarding wanting these to be resubmitted with MKR vesting for current positions not vacant ones. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40) - November 8, 2021 - Probably going to support this. Ratification Poll for Real-World Finance Core Unit MKR Compensation, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP38) - November 8, 2021 - in principle for MKR compensation but I don\u2019t like seeing this vesting for empty positions.  I also would like MKR compensation to be tied to net DAI profits and MKR being continually purchased from these profits and held to fund DSSVest. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) - November 8, 2021 - Generally going to support (same comments as above).   Still looking at budgets somewhat. Ratification Poll for Adding Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit, SAS-001 - November 8, 2021 - Yes here as it is my hope to have a single unit looking over all the details of auctions.  My issue here is this unit appears to have a analytics cost component that I would expect should be offloaded to the Analytics CU.   We really need to focus all data analytics needed for CUs through this CU vs. everyone doing their own stuff.   This is also true of UIs. ",

I also hope these units co-ordinate data with the CU-Analytics unit. Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - Agree with PaperImperium that we really need to address budgets and especially MKR compensation allocations to positions that are not filled. Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) - November 8, 2021 - voted NO I am for another parallel PECO unit.  I have multiple sources telling me that doing tokenized fixed rate derivatives WILL bring us squarely into regulator cross-hairs.  My statements for why I am against DECO are above.  Bad deal for Maker and a bad precedent as well. Still deciding on the rest of the polls. ",

Some thoughts below, even though I think it\u2019s ultimately @GovAlpha-Core-Unit\u2019s call on how to implement this.  Although the proposed incentive scheme seems simple, in reality I think the actual long-term incentives and outcomes are unknown. It\u2019s an interesting situation from a game-theoretical perspective where the total rewards are static but the Maker governance landscape is dynamic\u2014thus the incentives will be difficult to predict. If we end up doing this, let\u2019s at least start with a trial for a set amount of months. If we commit to this scheme and somehow the results aren\u2019t satisfactory, I think removing the scheme could lead to critique (again, it\u2019s all about the incentives) I believe this scheme is subject to a power law dynamic that we\u2019d rather prevent imo. @LongForWisdom mentioned a quadratic tipping trial that sounds like an interesting way to mitigate this.

                    "content": "Delegate Poll/Exec communication 20211120_1102UTC Poll votes: Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP39) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - This is a budget continuation so no actual changes other than MKR vesting to the CU vs. contributors.  I agree with @GFXlabs general assessment statement and recommendation regarding changes to how MKR vesting happens.   At this time though I don\u2019t see a strong reason to reject the budget modification.   If this MKR vesting is not addressed in the next set of budget cycles I will likely change my vote here from Yes to No. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - There is a moderate increase from 486 to 515K (about 6%) pertaining to travel and events.   I want to make a comment here that I would rather see a general accounting CU address these budget issues with all CUs within a report so governance can address the global budget more effectively and have some budget quality assurance checking happening.   As a delegate or voter micromanaging budgets at this fine grain is both time consuming and annoying.    One thing we can see is that accounting errors can be easily made when every CU has to do all of its own internal accounting.  I really want to put into place an accounting metric via an accounting CU that all CUs can follow so they don\u2019t have to spend precious resources for their own internal accounting units.   I see this happening generally btw, where CUs will spend time gathering their own data vs. using the data analytics unit and I wonder how much time has been spent doing accounting or analytics work vs. specific CU work. Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - This proposal seeks to add a CU that includes one MakerDAO contributor + Immunefi (a private company) to manage bug bounty program, opsec, and emergency response planning.  I agree this appears to take on responsibilities managed by PECO and that anything we can offload from PECO should be helpful to their productivity.    I want to re-iterate with respect to MKR compensation to CUs we should be doing this on a per hire level vs. a CU level and these should not be retroactive to empty positions.   I voted yes here because I don\u2019t believe now is the use MKR compensation at a CU level vs. hire level to stall addition of CUs.  In the future If this does not change I will likely be voting no on budget renewals. Ratification Poll for Adding Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit, SAS-001 - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - This is a CU with a pretty high price tag.  1.13M annual budget + about 250 MKR worth about 750K at current market price.   Even though this is a rather high budget, I know we will need it to retain productive experienced talent.   The basic issue as elaborated above is the MKR compensation again is retroactive, and to potentially empty FTEs which needs to be addressed.  In general while I am likely to change my view later as these budgets renew I don\u2019t see this as something to  stop the addition of needed CUs. Ratification Poll for Real-World Finance Core Unit MKR Compensation, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP38) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES mostly for consistency here.  I didn\u2019t want to single out RWF with their MKR compensation from other units.  This will change on the next budget requests if these MKR compensation components don\u2019t move away from CU level based to filled FTE requests. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES This is a request for 6 month budget of 425K DAI.   Again there are some accounting issues here with respect to clawing back some overbudget that an Accounting CU unit could help address.  Hopefully in time we will get this Accounting CU to help smooth over some of the over/under budget inconsistencies and errors in reporting.  We are going to need this both on DAI, on the MKR compensation and operations expenses. Ratification Poll for Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) - November 8, 2021 - voted YES - Maker has uses a single template for all collateral onboarding applications.  This template has not been updated to include RWA.  This modification is the first MIP which will include a set of new questions specific to RWA.   This is the first of a number of changes and modifications we will need for RWA and I am glad to see them added. Community Greenlight Poll - SB-frOGI (SolidBlock Red Frog Digital Coin) - November 15, 2021 - voted to Abstain Not entirely sure greenlight polls are useful except to stop protocol work.   It is difficult to asses anything about a collateral type before some analysis is made.   It would be nice to re-assess how governance greenlight polling.    Another general issue on these greenlight polls is that I would like to have statements from all CUs whether and how going forward or stopping a particular greenlight affects them would be helpful. Community Greenlight Poll - MONETALIS (Monetalis Wholesale SME Green Growth Lending) - November 15, 2021 - voted YES to this greenlight.   Comments above regarding greenlighting still apply.  I expect this one would still have gone through unless there was a significant no vote to stop it, with the heap of abstains I felt it was important enough to greenlight this to get it to the next stage. I am going to reiterate an important point here on greenlight polls on anything. I really want some statement from all CUs on these on whether/how they are affected by these moving forward or not.    I am having a hard time grappling with lack of CU statements of position on these and am getting a growing feeling that there are distinct views, opinions and needs going on within CUs that are not propagating up to the governance level.   At some point I am going to make a formal poll regarding a request for CU leads to write up some summary report regarding how pushing forward or not on a particular greenlight poll affects them so governance can have some information from Maker CUs before making their own decision. Current executive:  Onboarding WBTC-B, Increasing WBTC-A Stability Fee, Change of Covenants for P1-DROP, Offboarding Collaterals - November 19, 2021. - supported.  I am against DROP modifications the changes in rates wBTC-A going from 2.5 - 4% should give us a good read on pulse of wBTC A users with respect to fees. ilk.hole increases on ETH (A-C), wBTC-A and wsETH-A were well explained. Offboarding of BAL, COMP, AAVE, and changes to offboard LRC-A, BAT-A, ZRX-A, and UNIV2LINKETH-A vaults that are not significantly used will save us oracle fees. Onboarding wBTC-B just confirms my old thesis that multiple vaults on significant collateral types are useful and we can look forward to ETH-D, E, ,etc. and wBTC C, D, E\u2026 etc.   At some point I expect governance will finally make PSM-A, B, C, D, E which if used with different tin/tout spreads and DCs can by itself create a dynamic PSM spread and fees.  Some color on previous executive.  Parameter Changes, Return Unused Budget to the Surplus Buffer - November 12, 2021 - some more detail on my support of the previous executive.  Increasing GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A DC and changes to LR and SF are all reasonable.  I expect at some point the competition between PSM tin/tout 0 with this vault will make it less attractive until the PSMs empty and the PEG drops below 1 and then fees will allow this to be utilized more.  I do have some concerns that in adverse market conditions the GUNI bots won\u2019t be able to operate effectively rebalancing these v3 vaults.   Time will tell. wSTETH-A increase likely will be utilized. D3M increasing the AAVEv2-DAI line - has some hazards but probably a good thing.  At some point this should level out.   I do find it interesting that with this we can then control external rates thereby allowing a neutralization of rates between Maker and rest of markets helping to modulate liquidity sources/sinks into/out of PSM to deal with impossible trinity rate disparity.   Maker also gets additional return using this so finally we can earn return on DAI just by minting and placing it into these protocols. Was happy to see the 218K returned to the surplus, but I think this highlights budget projection and general accounting issues that need to be addressed.  ",

I won\u2019t try to block these but won\u2019t be voting for them with tin/tout= 0.  I am for PSMs with multiple spreads and DC to effectively hard code a dynamic PSM but the tin/tout values need to be > 0.  Already elaborated on hazards of locking the stablecoin markets to 1 through DAI via PSMs with tin/tout=0. Increase the Aave D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling - November 22, 2021 - voted YES While I think there are significant unintended hazard risks, I believe the potential benefits at this point outweigh those risks.   Being able to manage DAI return rates by floating liquidity into these protocols to start reducing return I have felt for a long time was a viable option to managing DAI demand.    Governance will need to be able to act quickly on these so if it doesn\u2019t already have it a D3M IAM module might be well considered. Add WBTC-C as a new Vault Type - November 22, 2021 - voted YES here.   Long ago I posited that having multiple vaults with different LR, SF, and DCs would be a useful way to allow users to choose their risk tolerance against fees.  Given how Maker is going in this direction I expect to see more of these appear to manage liquidation risks, offer users an even finer grain.  With 3rd party solutions such vault \u2018stacks\u2019 might offer some unique vault liquidation management strategies and customized rates. Increase the System Surplus Buffer - November 22, 2021 \u2013 voted in order  Increase to 130M by 1M/week Increase to 90M by 1M/week Increase to 130M by .67M/week Increase to 90M by .67M/week  I am a fan of burning because DSSVest is going to mint approximately 7500MKR in the next year for CU MKR compensation so we might as well get buying back the MKR out of the way now while the price is low. I also calculate that at 127M/yr revenue is 2.44M DAI/week so the minimum DAI slated for MKR burn here will be for almost 1.5M/week.  This is still 60% of net DAI revenue.   We also grow the surplus at 1M/week so by the time we hit 130M (which will take 70 weeks with this proposal) we will have burned approximately 105M DAI worth of MKR - which even at 5K/MKR would be 21,000MKR or 2.1% Work done to consider adjustments to the flapper almost always centered around either a 50:50 burn to sb growth or 66:33 burn to SB growth.  At above revenue growth we pretty much come in at 60:40 even though we don\u2019t take 1/2 of the MKR going to the burner and save it to fund DSSvest. In principle Maker governance can \u2018by hand\u2019 make MKR CU compensation sustainable simply by allowing MKR to be burned. With regards to burn model.  I think it would be interesting to just let the Surplus Buffer fill indefinitely and to use income from things like D3M to buy MKR to burn.   The concept here is to tie MKR burn formally to interest on our accumulated SB.  as this would be totally sustainable and build the surplus buffer as fast as possible. Right now the surplus buffer is less as a % of outstanding DAI than before Black Thursday  I think general consensus is that we should have this be more like 2-5% of our volatile assets (100-250M) given VAs total about 5B.

Use the MakerDAO Treasury to Fund MKR Expenses - November 29, 2021 - vote Yes I have discussed in a number of places the idea to connect MKR compensation to DAI earned (net expenses) to make this fully sustainable long term.   The basic idea is to take some % of the MKR bought by the flapper and send it to a modified DSSVest. Add GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A as a new Vault Type - November 29, 2021 - voted YES to this.   Likely rates here will need to be low to compensate for the leveraging going on.   Also it will be interesting to see what happens if DAI should drop below 1 and PSMs exhaust.   Probably not a huge risk to the system, but more of a risk to the users levering up here. One Time Payment to the GovComms CU to Deal with Budget Issues - November 29, 2021 - voted YES to this.   It is a minor adjustment due to an accounting error after returning surplus funds to surplus.   Shows us that a real accounting unit to at least do quality assurance accounting checking is needed.  This is also true of the oracle budgets.  Honestly would rather have professionals focusing on budget work than each CU having to appoint one person to do their accounting and budgeting. Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - November 29, 2021 Stability Fee Increases  Increase the ETH-A Stability Fee from 2.5% to 2.75%. Increase the ETH-B Stability Fee from 6.0% to 6.5%. Increase the LINK-A Stability Fee from 1.5% to 2.5%. Increase the MANA-A Stability Fee from 3.0% to 6.0%. Increase the UNI-A Stability Fee from 1.0% to 3.0%. Increase the GUSD-A Stability Fee from 0.0% to 1.0%. Increase the UNIV2DAIETH-A Stability Fee from 1.5% to 2.0%. Increase the UNIV2WBTCETH-A Stability Fee from 2.5% to 3.0%. Increase the UNIV2USDCETH-A Stability Fee from 2.0% to 2.5%. Increase the UNIV2UNIETH-A Stability Fee from 2.0% to 4.0%.  Other Changes  Decrease the GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A Stability Fee from 0.5% to 0.1%. Increase the WBTC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 1.5 billion DAI to 2 billion DAI. Increase the WBTC-A Target Available Debt (gap) from 60 million DAI to 80 million DAI.  I voted YES as the changes are not unreasonable.  I do have some concerns we already have vaults not earning enough income to cover oracles in this list.  It is likely some of these may be pushed over the edge with these increases.    Also drops in GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A seems a bit extreme from .5-.1%.  I have long supported wBTC because I felt BTC was the prime candidate to mint significant DAI.  Here we are over 1B DAI from wBTC alone.   Hopefully Maker will add ETH/wBTC D, E, F etc vaults to fill the LR, SF gaps to help spread CRs, potential liquidations, and give users more choices of risk and fees. Add CurveLP-stETH-ETH as a new Vault Type - November 29, 2021 - voted YES I agree with @rune that Maker probably wants to have these staking vaults.  The concern here is that liquidity will fragment as more staking services come on-line and we may not get enough fees to cover the oracle costs as time goes on.   But I am willing to take the chance to bring these forward to see if staked ETH becomes the new dominant vault type.    What i honestly would like to see is staked ETH paired with DAI v2 LP vaults.   But the liquidity isn\u2019t there yet. ",

Pretty much support most of the above. I think the GUNI-A vault won\u2019t be sustainable at 1% - time will tell. Some of the rate changes will probably push vaults into the eliminate category.  MANA, UNI.  It would be nice when people make vaults at least on oasis a feature to add an e-mail or some contact so people can have \u2018a chance\u2019 of being informed of changes to their vaults to be able to take action. Lastly.   Regarding Delegate compensation.  Shut my mouth during the CC and have pretty much remained silent until this post on the issue of governance compensation, Delegate or Otherwise. There are so many points to be made here:  One would think compensation for performance would be coupled.  My voting performance 100% over the November period. The vote coupling formally the 90/90 performance for the compensation was not voted on until end of October and this was the prime reason compensation IS only for November and not going back to october. There is no formal definition of the performance metric (what time period this covers). The performance level being binary or having curves that just drop to 0 anywhere is arbitrary. The idea only delegates get compensated and no-one else voting in governance seems extreme and unfair to everyone else (shadow delegates and others) generally. There is no distinction between executive support or poll at all with these performance metrics.  I have elaborated two alternative approaches to governance compensation (one posted formally and the other here because I had hoped to get some basic comments from GovAlpha and a few others).  It is my impression rather than launch some MIP on the community for approval/disapproval to try to get some pre-MIP discussion going first.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:   Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal.  Simple gover\u2026      and    Suggested changes to Maker Delegation system. Governance       I was thinking about the Maker MKR delegate compensation and talking about this with a friend who is a former elected official.  https://forum.makerdao.com/t/delegate-compensation-informal-poll  As a delegate my own conflict of interest on this poll is that I stand to gain some \u2018compensation\u2019.  Whether a delegate or not, as a MKR holder I think if a delegate can self elect and then delegate to themselves their own MKR to \u2018earn compensation\u2019 this will be a potential system abuse vector.  Governan\u2026     There are a number of other discussions around this topic too numerous to list.   Key take away points here is that at no point was there a real discussion regarding the actual goals and the many different ways to achieve them.  Why delegates should be treated differently in governance vs. all other participants. What are the tangible/measurable goveranance goals and how to achieve them. Button pushers who may not own one MKR deciding things for those who do own MKR, just to get executives passed, or what? Getting more participation and input via any other models, snapshot polling of MKR, vaults, DAI holders. What was historical participation? Information/report regarding current MKR holders, delegating or not, voting or not.  There also has been minimal discussion about how delegates \u2018self elect\u2019, nor time periods or mechanics to garner support, much less any discussion about the significant disparity in MKR delegated and not just how this affects compensation, but also how it affects governance. Put simply there are basically now 2-3 key delegates with lions share of the MKR delgated and everyone else in governance falls in the wash.   I have to wonder will @monet-supply who has 75% voting record - even if he voted 100% in the next 2 months would feel still not earning any compensation.   Or worse a shadow delegate who might vote near 100% with 5-10K MKR (I don\u2019t think these are, but how would we know? GovAlpha pretty much ignoring anyone other than delegates in their governance computations, much less give a historical governance perspective). I know @LongForWisdom was not happy with the outcome that I wouldn\u2019t be compensated in November, and guess what I also won\u2019t be compensated for December because 1 executive vote isn\u2019t going to be enough to push me over.   Even though I had 100% participation after a family event that put my wife in the hospital that caused me to miss an executive and 7-8 polls.   I honestly don\u2019t remember the details other than some polls only run from Monday to Thursday and if you miss them you miss them.    So if someone starts off as a delegate and missed (for any reason) they pretty much are hosed for one or more months until they get their \u2018lifetime\u2019 numbers up.    Yet someone who happened to start off and do 11 months 100% pretty much could take the last month off and still collect full compensation and since everything only runs 12 months, rinse and repeat the above. There is no concept of vacation, of illness, or anything else that goes with a normal job considered in these \u2018performance metrics\u2019 and in that sense and so many others (with respect to other governance players) are unfair, and inequitable. I find a general theme with Maker as a broad brush hard, and let the outliers lay when it comes to everything.  Rather than focus on providing choices and consequences, do what is simplest from a smart contract perspective or what is easiest\u2026   There is this general impression to ignore any other sides of anything, stakeholders included.   Vault holders have zero say unless they hold MKR, or participate in forums on anything, same with DAI holders.    I suggested long ago to offer a DAI reward to vault holders to answer some polling questions, same with DAI holders.    To be sure there is a lot to do at Maker, but each action or inaction by Maker has implications, not just on other communities, but on people and based on the above when changes are made or systems put into place I would like some group, some CU to take on the responsibility of looking at such changes from all stakeholder perspectives. Frankly I have grown tired of trying to remind this community that its actions have a broader affect and scope than just MKR holders and when I put my vote down to support delegate compensation, while being left out of this, it just tells me do less not more.   I think @PaperImperium distinctly felt this and many, many others who probably \u2018took it like a man\u2019 and haven\u2019t said a word, some who are still working in CUs, and others who basically have left Maker. It is my hope that in time MakerDAO grows more sophisticated and empathic about the entire community and not just focus its vision myopically on MKR holders. For now I am done with this topic, and going to take a general break from thinking and working on Maker ideas and enjoy the holiday times with my family, my coworkers and wish everyone,  MKR holders Maker workers Maker Delegates Maker Vault owners DAI holders the entire Defi crypto ecosystem(s) and the world  A Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year. Let us all hope, affirm and pray (whatever you do) for a 2022 that is better financially, personally, and communally for us all. ",

The concern here is what happens to these vault users should the DAI PEG break 1 by any substantial amount for any length of time particularly with the high leverage being applied. Community Greenlight Poll - aUST (Anchor TerraUSD) - December 06, 2021 - NO I have had my own experience on Terra network and I agree with analysis by @monet-supply [aUST] MIP6 aUST Collateral Onboarding Application - #7 by monet-supply regarding the higher than normal risk.  With rather low liquidity and price volatility I don\u2019t believe aUST is mature or robust enough from a risk perspective. Adjust MATIC-A System Parameters - December 06, 2021 - YES I very much want to support Polygon ecosystem as I feel like out of the many of the available sidechains that they have the most robust activity and growth.   The high MC of polygon (now almost 24B) means there is significant TVL that can be locked and a number of significant opportunities for both Maker and Polygon to build more DAI liquidity and availability on Polygon. Adjust wstETH-A System Parameters - December 06, 2021 - YES Seems like a pretty steep DC increase 50-200M so there is \u2018some\u2019 concern over added system risks but it is hard to see how this could be such a big issue other than further concentrating a very high ETH portfolio component by some moderate amount.

Please review the discussion thread to help inform your position before voting.  Replacing MKR Vesting Streams As per this successful governance poll, the following MKR vesting streams will be canceled and replaced by streams funded by the Protocol Treasury (Pause Proxy) if this executive proposal passes. 1,051.25 MKR will be streamed to the Oracles Core Unit (ORA-001) starting July 1, 2021 through July 1, 2022 at 0x2d09B7b95f3F312ba6dDfB77bA6971786c5b50Cf in accordance with their active budget proposal.

All team members have a 1-year cliff and will have their 995 MKR streamed over 4 years.  Nothing out of line with the above so I supported this.   I really would like to have MKR flapped connected to MKR rewards so this fully sustainable long term.  Fortunately the flapper has been active buying and burning (so far 3K MKR) so after another 6 months we might have burnt the MKR being vested from this executive. ",

DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Net Rates Spread - December 13, 2021 - YES I have some concerns here, but MakerDAO can reverse course should any of my concerns below manifest. Comments about D3M with AAVE related to both the above votes. The biggest issue here to my mind is that while we would like to source DAI through AAVE that inflation across the 3rd world is at 30-40 year highs and so rates will have to rise.   Also given Maker has been raising rates if via D3M we make borrowing more attractive than Maker on AAVE we basically will be killing our own business to enhance AAVE which is probably a good reason to hold the stkAAVE and to watch this carefully\u2026   People seem to believe that AAVE like MKR will back the system when it fails.   @LongForWisdom rightly reminded people that during BlackThursday MKR price went from $600-200 (66% MC drop) and I will add MKR flop auctions had to be halted for roughly a week before auction bidders could be located and the 6M DAI liquidity sourced before the MKR flop auctions could be successfully reenstated selling MKR at 250-280.   Should we have a more significant loss event AAVE may not be able to source sufficient liquidity.   This would apply to both AAVE and then quite possibly should Maker not have a sufficient Surplus Buffer to MKR\u2026 Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier - December 13, 2021 - supported with YES I don\u2019t like voting on delegate compensation generally due to conflict of interest issues, but even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate I would be supporting these.   I do think MakerDAO needs to adopt a different compensation model which rewards all governance MKR equally and fairly based on a poll and executive bounty model suggested above in my platform.   Then rewards are automatically based on performance and are tied linearly to the MKR voted, delegates getting a 50% pass through reward get compensation based on the amount of MKR they vote.    This would lower my own compensation btw but I think it solves various issues around arbitrary performance metrics.   Any alternative I believe should be based on a delegate election model and all delegates elected then should receive the same compensation no matter how much MKR they vote as all time and opinions then are equally valued.   This 10K MKR as the compensation value cutoff is also arbitrary and has no real performance averaging or buffer for delegates to achieve. My point here is if MakerDAO is going to compensate delegates it should do it via a model that is fair and equitable either by rewarding MKR based on poll, executive bounties, or equally by forcing all delegates to pass through some sort of election cycle and then no matter how much MKR is delegated to them get equal pay.  The idea that governance representatives should get compensated based on their constituency is almost absurd and leads to all kinds of governance abuses and forms of control (I will take your MKR away if you don\u2019t vote this way) that MakerDAO in the future may wish to eliminate.  To be sure there are complex issues to deal with in any form of governance, but the arbitrary nature of the structure of delegation as well as compensation I believe is not optimal.    As people like to echo here (I disagree with this btw) better to start with something than nothing.   This is a test, even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate I would be voting yes, and governance can change this model AT ANY TIME. ",

Honestly I am thinking we should also consider a USDC D3M module to attempt to normalize rates on both DAI and USDC across the space but this is a separate topic.   Given we have other PSMs we also could look at managing stablecoin borrow rates across the larger players in DeFI.   Of interest here would be a good look at rates on L2s and possibly sidechains as the costs and liquidity needed may be more manageable.   The idea of duplicating Maker functionality on L2 and potentially sidechains is attractive (with my previous caveats) mostly because fees on a number of these networks is so much lower.  Issues with sidechains is security but honestly if Maker were to commit to putting up presences on these and connecting them together UI wise (like sushiswap has done) this may actually give Maker a model to \u2018serve the underserved\u2019 again vs. what it is becoming (serving the whales, institutional players which has pros/cons). Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold - January 10, 2022 - voted YES - I stand by my comments here that GovAlpha has done nothing to test and characterize response.  There also has been no discussion regarding the potential negative affects a Maker ES would have to Maker, and DeFI in general.   Many people do not realize that the Emergency Shutdown is a forced repay of all DAI, withdrawal of collateral, and a restart of an entirely new system with DAI2 vs. DAI1, etc.   The implications here are significant.   I had hope to write up a post with a Poll on this issue to determine whether we still actually want the ES as an option or whether Maker and DAI are so integrated with DeFI that MakerDAO needs to come up with alternative models to \u2018pause\u2019 and then \u2018restart\u2019 Maker. Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance - January 10, 2022 - Abstained here mostly because I don\u2019t have a clear understanding of Maple.   Will defer to others in absence of information. Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES here.   I am personally a UNIV2ETHUSDC vault user and I think the dust increase from 15K to 60K is pretty extreme when compared to the 15-25K on what UNIETH etc.    It is not entirely clear to me the reasoning here especially with the 15-25K.   At some point Maker is going to pretty much clear the decks for any small Maker users on L1. FYI:   My own data suggests that uniswap v2 TOKEN-STABLECOIN vaults actually have much better return characteristics (almost 2x in many cases) than TOKEN-ETH and this is due to almost zero correlation (or even slightly anti-correlation) of STABLECOIN prices to TOKEN prices. Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow - January 10, 2022 - Abstained - I really don\u2019t want to deal with these in a one off mode.   I would rather governance deal with this with a policy.  Remember every one of us using blockchain has been warned or learned at one time or another - you send funds to a non-recoverable address your funds are gone.   I believe we need global refund criterion and a handling/punishment fee here to warn people using DAI (just like any TOKEN screw up at real hazard).  If they had sent this to a dead address would these people be asking us for 10M DAI gift to cover their loss (because the funds were lost)? The rest of these polls I simply put in a placeholder vote as how I see these now these polls run another 2 weeks\u2026   With more information I may be willing to change my mind Community Greenlight Poll - OGN (Origin Protocol) - January 10, 2022 - NO simply because Maker has offboarded higher liquidity and better distribution tokens due to inability to cover oracle fees. Community Greenlight Poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar) - January 10, 2022 - NO same as above.  The idea of the promise of 100M deposited while may be appealing takes away from the limited liquidity elsewhere.  in OGN this gets even worse.   This would put Maker as being a primary token holder.    This ecosystem just isn\u2019t large enough both from a user perspective as well as a liquidity one at least not to function organically and from an institutional level one just seems to risky for the limited rewards. Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings) - January 10, 2022 - Voted NO - my impression here is that this is just too new.  I have a number of concerns over tokenized RE.  The primary one is that at least in the US only Reg D investors can hold these which means any sort of liquidation will have limited players.   Honestly I am back to a basic issue on RWA MIP6\u2019s.  In the absence of tangible information I don\u2019t believe governance can make an informed decision about whether to move forward. Community Greenlight Poll - TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD) - January 10, 2022 - Abstained here.  My tendency is to approve this for green light and to get reports from CUs.  It is unclear whether TUSD will bring any real liquidity to DAI nor whether we want to onboard more of these.  If you are believer in the PSM model for PEG management you want more.  My attitude is that the PSM model of PEG management \u2018in time\u2019 will be found not to be sustainable.  Worse the 0 fees on both sides of this trade pretty much price fix all PSM stablecoin prices to each other.  This is the worst form of price fixing and if ANY SINGLE stablecoin in the Maker PSM umbrella is affected the risk will be the entire DC to the surplus.    Also this kind of price fixing, and market monopolistic tendencies usually are not looked at well by various regulatory agencies.   If there is a problem rest assured regulators will be taking a very hard look at Maker policies in creating the hazard. Community Greenlight Poll - USDap (BondAppetit) - January 10, 2022 - NO - This whole 100% LR with low SF is pretty much a risk hazard with no real reward.   Again on these RW MIP6s my tendency is to abstain and suggest to CUs/MakerDAO to come up with a better model to pre-filter these MIP6s and to add CU co-authors/sponsors so we know these have at least passed a cursory level scrutiny before being forwarded to governance. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) (MIP40c3-SP45) - January 10, 2022 - Abstain - I honestly wanted to vote NO mostly because of this 3M claiming to be owed to \u2018the Foundation\u2019 which doesn\u2019t exist and existed solely to pay for these expenses.   I have serious issues with lack of financial reports from the foundation \u2018of any kind\u2019 and the black box the non-profit Foundation was in terms of legal and financial structure.   For all we know those who owned the top level for profit the Foundation was under could be walking with 10-20-100M in assets and without any report or even the remotest look, we simply take statements \u2018on faith\u2019.  The fact these same people gave MakerDAO 84K MKR and then had the audacity to ask for 3M in oracle costs suggests people in that group can\u2019t do decent accounting.  I still to this day don\u2019t know what was \u2018borrowed\u2019 ETH or DAI or some combination, nor when this happened.   This is not what transparency is about.    I am completely for covering forward Oracle expenses, in fact I think the emergency fund is low and Maker should completely rethink taking cash and buying ETH and pairing it with USDC to generate return.   If the price of ETH drops we end up with more ETH,  if it rises we make USDC and lose a little ETH, but over time this UNIV2ETHUSDC generates about .08-.1%/day returns.   Also Oracles could actually use the UNIV2ETHUSDC Maker vault to borrow DAI and lever this up increasing the returns by 2-2.5x (from 25 to 50+%/yr).  In the end analysis I decided to tentatively abstain and let others decide this one way or another. Ratification Poll for Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES - Observations from a current 24/7/365 operations specialist that worked as a freelance consult and/or operations specialist in various capacities in operations directly for now almost 30 years now.   The 9 FTEs might be sufficient for 1 man 24/7/365 coverage with gaps, and companies with < 1K/hr revenues, but most companies earning > 10K/hr had at least 2 man deep operations coverage because 1 single outage event could cost them between 100-500K and affect business generally.   I also found interesting statements about what this group \u2018will not\u2019 do when taken in the context of experience that operations tends to be the dumping ground for all enterprise issues.   When I sat in hiring rounds for operations group leaders what we wanted to hear from prospective hires was \u201cl will do everything required to satisfy operational goals as long as properly funded and staffed\u201d not \u201cWhat I won\u2019t do.\u201d  Operations is a \u2018above and beyond\u2019 type of dirty business, not a pick and choose clean business. Ratification Poll for the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) - January 10, 2022 - voted YES - Will add more informed comments later.  My impression is that this is more of an accounting and quality assurance group.  Unclear to me how this fits but we definitely need a peripheral group looking at Maker overall and providing reports.   I honestly would like to see this group work as a delegate MakerDAO research and report arm. Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) - January 10, 2022 - YES - The hardest part of any organization isn\u2019t on-boarding people but off-boarding them.  I would like to see some standardization of criterion for offboarding than just someone deciding one or more people/CUs need to be offboarded.    I would like to see these have some form of complain/appeal system before they even get to governance as everyone in a job can\u2019t just be fired without cause unless they are in a probationary period.   Which itself should be considered for new CUs (at least a 1 year probation period where any individual or CU can be offboarded without cause.  This forces people to be on their best behavior for at least a year and after that then some real cause needs to be made to remove someone - even if this is a budgetary thing).   There are real manpower psychological issues here that need to be considered (how these approaches will affect hiring, or removing).   I consider this to be one of the greatest challenges of all DAOs to be considered and tailored with care.   This MIP at least is a start. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47) - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES. Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64) - January 10, 2022 - YES - Required to fund bounty programs. Ratification Poll for Maker Keeper Network (MIP63) - January 10, 2022 - YES - MakerDAO definitely needs to work on improving the keeper network. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) - January 10, 2022 - ABSTAIN - As one who has friends and peripherially worked in media production in the past I realize that 6 months probably isn\u2019t a fair look at what this group can accomplish.   Willing to give this group more time here but not enough to vote NO.   Put simply I don\u2019t feel like I have enough objective information to make a call one way or another here in such a short period. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES.  I have some conflict of interest concerns and can\u2019t speak for Will myself but trust @rune with respect to judgement.  I honestly feel Maker would be well suited to continue looking for someone who wants this position long term. Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit Budget - DUX-001 (MIP40c3-SP52) - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) (MIP40c3-SP55) - January 10, 2022 - Voted YES Some general CU budget comments:   I have some issues with how these budgets are evolving and lack of any KPIs being applied.  For the time being Maker has funds, at some point in the future we may not and when choosing between minting and selling MKR to cover expenses or tightening the belt it will not be pleasant time.  I hope CUs keep this in mind when managing budget requests.  It is nice to see some caps being applied and hope to see more of this in the future. ",

The primary one is that at least in the US only Reg D investors can hold these which means any sort of liquidation will have limited players. Honestly I am back to a basic issue on RWA MIP6\u2019s. In the absence of tangible information I don\u2019t believe governance can make an informed decision about whether to move forward.   Hi MakerMan, Thanks so much for your feedback! I\u2019m Scarlet Chen, Robinland\u2019s CEO, and I\u2019m here to answer any question you might have. I wanted to clarify 2 things:  Security tokens does not mean Reg D. Reg A allows any US non accredited investor to invest and Reg S allows non-US investors to invest. CeresCoin is a recent case where a crypto company was approved by the SEC to issue a Reg A fund. More importantly, retail investors are not involved in any stage of the process that Robinland is proposing. After tokenization of the real estate debt asset, Robinland will not sell the tokens to retail investors, but will pledge them entirely to Maker to access financing. In other words, all that Robinland does is a transformation of RWA into on-chain collateral, such that developers can access financing from Defi lenders to build a more sustainable physical world. This is actually an advantage of our proposal compared to other ones where retail investors are involved, because when there is no retail investor, compliance risk is minimal. This might bring question of \u2018what happens if Maker wants to sell these security tokens\u2019. In fact, MonetSupply has asked that question on his delegate platform and we\u2019ve addressed it there. We\u2019ve also posted the reply to our proposal.  Hope that this addresses your concern, and we\u2019re happy to answer any other question you or the community might have! ",

This is actually an advantage of our proposal compared to other ones where retail investors   This is the part that puts pretty high risk exclusively on Maker.   I share similar concerns with @monet-supply regarding liquidation or this put option.   The point here is that it is not clear Robinland will be able to source liquidity \u2018at price\u2019 to for these positions to be exited should markets shift against Robinland. It is not clear that the proposed structure scales well, nor who is going to be responsible for the independent auditing of the state of this tokenized bundled RE portfolio being built nor who sits with what assets as the first investors to lose should the value of this portfolio come under market pressure   My concern is that there isn\u2019t sufficient investment buffer to mitigate the significant and exclusive risk being presented to Maker.  I also have concerns about Robinland being in charge of the liquidations presenting a conflict of interest hazard. The point here is that in your reply you say:     Scarlet_Chen:  Security tokens does not mean Reg D. Reg A allows any US non accredited investor to invest and Reg S allows non-US investors to invest. CeresCoin is a recent case where a crypto company was approved by the SEC to issue a Reg A fund.   Yet Robinland is not going to sell one token to these investors, nor does it look like Robinland is going to allow markets to develop to trade these tokens enabling both a token pricing oracle to be created, as well as a market to liquidate them into.    I don\u2019t understand how there is benefit to tokenizing real estate portfolios (or even individual issues) if one isn\u2019t going to allow 3rd party markets to form to trade these.   In effect your company is complicating the what could be a more straight forward Arranger model and legal structure by tokenizing vs. simply presenting the portfolio to first some investor group for initial financing (to provide the loss buffer beyond this 90% LTV being proposed) and to approach Maker and other investors to pick up the rest there by diversifying the risk to multiple investor layers structured appropriately with reward against the risk taken. Hence my opinion here is the structure of the Robinland isn\u2019t mature enough (in your proposal said you are still working on legal details), there isn\u2019t sufficient investor diversification, and there is a over complication regarding tokenizing which would be useful when looking to seek investors in the crypto DeFI space, but not so useful if your company is going to offload 100% of these tokens on to Maker.  When I heap on that Robinland is also the liquidator this particular proposal looks to be significantly outside not just of the risk profile Maker wants to take on, but also will not be able to support the Stablity Fee that would be required to mitigate these pretty extreme risks. I would be much more interested if Robinland was more mature, had robust trading markets and large Market Cap and already had investors on board at various risk levels in front of the token holders here and would encourage Robinland to come back when the RBLD token and your business is more established.   Alternatively consider working a different structure than tokenizing as this is not required for Maker to be able to take on real world assets. This proposal honestly looks more like a solicitation for exclusive investment vs. establishing a borrow facility and Maker holding most if not all of these tokens is only going to earn SF and not get a return via RBLD tokens for making this investment.   So in the loosest sense Robinland gets all the upside while Maker takes on all the investment risk and Robinland sits not just as the presenter, manager of this business but also the liquidation manager.

                    "content": "Hi MakerMan, Thanks so much for the detailed response! We really appreciate it! It\u2019s the first time we received such detailed feedback which really helped us understand where the concerns are. Kindly see our answers below: First, we would like to clarify one key difference between Robinland and other models, which is how we deliver Maker the senior position for its lending. In other models, as you mentioned, they acquire financing from other sources (such as from retail investors) who serve as the \u2018first loss\u2019 tranche. and give maker the \u2018senior\u2019 tranche:  1600\u00d7843 83.3 KB  For these projects, the underlying asset are the entire capital stack of a project (such as the Centrifuge case and the REINNO case). Even though it appears that the \u2018structure\u2019 has given Maker a senior position, the underlying collateral is more risky. However, in the Robinland model, the \u2018senior\u2019 position of Maker is given by the underlying asset itself:  1600\u00d7793 72.9 KB  As you can see, our collateral pool consists of only the senior lien of a capital stack. Our senior lien debt also comes with full-recourse right over the entirety of the underlying asset, which is not something that other proposals deliver. In other words, we are actually more secure for Maker because the senior position comes from legal rights associated with the underlying asset itself rather than financial engineering. Let\u2019s raise a specific example:  Under other proposals: say for example there\u2019s a project sized $1mn with $800k senior tranche tokens pledged to Maker and $200k \u2018first loss\u2019 tokens sold to retail investors. If the project defaults and only $600k is retrieved, retail investors lose all of their tokens\u2019 value and Maker loses 25% of its collateral value ($200k/$800k). Under Robinland\u2019s proposal: we only finance senior lien debt with full recourse rights, meaning that Maker has claim over the entirety of the underlying asset and the right to go after the borrower personally until the value of the entire loan is recovered. Say a project is worth $1m, and its senior lien is only $200k, then we only get that $200k into our portfolio, and in turn to Maker. In case of default, we as the underwriter has the right to take any legal action to recover the full $200k (the individual is personally liable to repay the $200k in full).  Note: Another difference between us and most other projects is that we\u2019re funding real estate debt while others funding equity. The first has intrinsically less risk than the second for various reasons: (1) easier to price (2) smaller ticket size (3) there exists an extremely liquid private-placement market for first lien commercial real estate loans (4) shorter time horizon (6-36 months instead of, say, 30 years) and (5) less value fluctuation correlated with real estate market conditions (i.e. less \u2018market beta\u2019). Second, on the point w/ retail investors. One might be worried that \u2018no retail investor involved\u2019 brings risk to Maker because there\u2019s not an active market for RBL tokens when it comes to liquidation. In fact, not having retail investors involved is a benefit to Maker:  First, the SEC is mostly (or almost only) concerned with projects dealing with retail investors. There\u2019s a saying \u2018there\u2019s only compliance for retail\u2019. As the regulatory environment tightens around stablecoins, the less exposure projects that Maker onboards has towards retail investors, the less compliance risk Maker has to deal with Second, having retail investors trade the same token (RBL) as what\u2019s pledged to Maker in its collateral pool means systematic risk in the crypto market can be passed on to Maker\u2019s portfolio.  The underlying asset, first-lien commercial real estate debt, has very slow and small price movements (as a feature of that asset class). If RBL are solely pledged to Maker, Maker only has to deal with the value fluctuation of the underlying asset (commercial real estate debt), which is very slow moving. However, if RBL tokens are also sold to retail investors, then changes in sentiments in the security token secondary market will also lead Maker\u2019s collateral value to fluctuate. There are non-fundamental reasons in the crypto market that might lead to price movements of a real estate backed security token. Having retail investors to trade RBL means Maker is exposing its collateral to risks both in the underlying asset market and the crypto secondary market. This might induce unnecessary offloading of tokens when there\u2019s no change to the fundamental value of the underlying asset.    In fact, the team has contemplated another model (in previous iterations of the proposal) to (1) include retail investors in the structure and (2) potentially mimic other proposals in having 2 tranches, as follows:  957\u00d7524 32.7 KB  As you can see, Maker\u2019s funds and retail investors\u2019 funds go into the same SPV to fund the project. If Maker prefers such a model, we can definitely amend our proposal to reflect that, but we believe our current plan is better for the following reasons:  As mentioned above, we believe this brings Maker more risk in the value of its underlying collateral, which outweighs the benefits in having retail investors in the case of liquidation (addressed in the next section) If we are to offer such a structure + 2 tranches, we are legally obligated to offer retail investors choices of both tranches as well, and there might not be enough buyers interested in the \u2018first loss\u2019 tranche Given the same underlying asset (i.e. one real estate project), if we are to financial engineer it to form different tranches, this means we need to create 2 different risk-return profile, i.e. carefully allocating the underlying risk & return into 2 parts. This is a job that requires much finesses, and based on what we see during the 08 crisis, a recipe for large systematic risk Note: If \u2018other sources of financing\u2019 in the previous comment refers to banks, then it\u2019s almost surely that banks will not take the \u2018first loss\u2019 tranche as they always seek the most secured part of a capital stack; if it refers to other Defi lenders such as Maker, then it\u2019s unlikely that they have very different preference than Maker does, i.e. both would want the same tranche; if we are to seek financing from traditional lenders such as real estate PE, then (1) the very high return they ask for will put Maker\u2019s tranche in danger as well (we will need to ask for higher LTV or lower rates from Maker given the same underlying risk) and (2) this also invalidates our mission of replacing traditional sources of financing for real estate developers  Third, on liquidation and why we want to create security tokens RBL. We are well aware of the fact that Maker can accept individual real estate assets as collateral and extend loans in the form of stablecoins. The reason why we decided to pledge RBL security tokens is two-fold:  Notice that RBL tokens are issued by Robinland Asset Management, an umbrella entity that holds all project-specific SPVs. This means we\u2019ve turned non-fungible, heterogeneous real estate debt projects into a fungible, homogeneous token. This means RBL (especially as we have more projects funded) becomes a representation of \u2018first lien commercial real estate loan\u2019 in general This way, RBL can be traded on security exchanges that are already out there, as it\u2019s a very generic asset. Security tokens will grow to $162 trillion in trading volume by 2030. The volume of commercial real estate is $1 trillion, and that of residential real estate is $2.5 trillion per year. As you can see, having the tokenized version of the underlying commercial real estate asset pledged with Maker provides it an extra liquidation option: it can be directly sold in the existing security token exchanges, which has a much higher potential volume than the market of the underlying asset itself as this market grows. However, in the previous response, we stressed the last resort of liquidity, which is that we as Robinland can execute the sale of the underlying asset to help Maker liquidate the RBL tokens it has on its hand. The reason why we emphasized that is because it is a strength of our team: with our COO Venus being in the RE industry for 7 years, she is plugged into a robust network of secondary market buyers of commercial real estate loans. We can place a loan as soon as in a week when Maker would like to execute such a sale Lastly, we want to address Maker\u2019s worry of \u2018conflict of interest\u2019. In New York, all mortgage foreclosures are judicial foreclosures (meaning that the foreclosing lender must commence and prosecute a lawsuit). We have to follow the foreclosure process complying with the relevant statutes, regulations, state laws, and local rules governing commercial mortgage foreclosures in state court in New York. Thus, the main reason to choose Robinland subsidiaries as the liquidation manager is simply because we will take care of the labor-heavy part of the work to handle the court and lawyers. After we finish the foreclosure process, we have the legal obligation to pay back Maker the amount we borrowed. The conflict of interest is not a concern as (1) the amount recovered is determined not by Robinland, but the court who acts as an independent arbiter (2) the amount recovered is completely transparent (i.e. open information) and (3) Robinland is required by the law to pay back the full amount recovered to Maker. If Maker prefers to take on the labor-intensive part of the process, we are more than happy to amend our proposal to reflect that, e.g. (1) let Maker appoint a third party to execute the sales and/or (2) let Maker appoint a third party to supervise Robinland\u2019s execution of the sales of the underlying asset  Fourth, on the point of oracle data source, a third party appraisal company is hired to determine the underlying value of each loan project - world-class global real estate consultancies such as CBRE, BakerTilly, JLL, and Cushman & Wakefield. We will use them as our certified data resources. The value of the security tokens issued by Robinland Portfolio Management SPV is the sum of the value of all such project specific SPVs, which each equal to the value of the underlying loan asset based on the third party appraisal report. Furthermore, these projects will be reassessed on a regular basis. All the documents produced in the process will be made available to any third party auditor appointed by Maker. Fifth, on the experience and track record of the team. What\u2019s worth noting is that, even though it appears as if Robinland has no track record, the team members have been doing the same underlying operational & legal process in their previous career: the process of borrowing from Maker also involves putting together a 506b or 506c Reg D fund. Its partner, Crowdfunz, is one with 5 years of track record, 0 default rate, and $100mn value worth of assets under management. Our COO Venus worked w/ the CEO of Crowdfunz for years in their previous career. This is extremely relevant because the market, the type of asset, the business model, and the industry connections carries over to Robinland 100%; the only difference is that instead of raising funds from traditional sources, like a real estate PE, we\u2019re raising from Defi lenders such as Maker instead:  Our COO Venus:  Structured 3 successful Reg D 506b fund, AUM over $100mn: $300mn Senior Loan Letter of Intent for real estate project during the peak of pandemic and rock-bottom of the RE market Reg A: designed and structured previous employer\u2019s first Reg A fund single-handedly and got approved by the SEC in 1 year (light speed by SEC Reg A standard)   Our project supplier Crowdfunz:  5 years of track record, 0 default, over 50 projects financed, $100mn value under management Over 4000 accredit retail investors as repeated customers with $20k min ticket size    To summarize, Robinland takes on all the heavy-labor and default risk (i.e. the downside) and provides Maker the upside (i.e. effortlessly including high-quality real world assets into its portfolio to diversify its own portfolio risk). We minimize the risk Maker takes on through both the design of our structure & providing the highest quality underlying asset:  RBL represents fractions of a portfolio of loans; mutual insurance among the loans minimizes risk of the overall portfolio. The underlying collaterals are full-recourse right senior lien debt, which is more secure than any asset we\u2019ve seen in other real estate MIP6 applications. The senior lien debt itself is equivalent to the \u2018senior tranche\u2019 in a capital stack MakerMan suggested. (See illustration in section 1 for details) The full-recourse right (again not present in other real estate MIP6 proposals) is the highest level of protection for real estate debt projects, as it means the entirety of the value of the loan can be traced back in the case of default. If we were to adopt the tranching method MakerMan suggested, defaults on the \u2018first loss\u2019 tranche can still affect the senior lien, as outlined at the end of section 1 in the example We provide 3 layers of protection for Maker: a put option (which we will execute until Maker\u2019s needs are satisfied) for the RBL tokens; full-recourse right given by the underlying asset; Robinland\u2019s industry connection with a robust secondary market for senior lien commercial real estate debt buyers We are taking on most of the labor-intensive steps in the process because (1) we have the right skillset, experience, and industry connections in our team to do so (2) which alleviates Maker from touching the dirty work (3) and achieves our mission of serving as a bridge between Trad-Fi and DeFi - as the financial service provider, we let all the transformation happen within, such that our partners - real estate developer & DeFi lenders can stay within their comfort zone There isn\u2019t a concern over \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 as (1) all the valuation and audit of the loan portfolio is conducted by industry-standard third party consultancies such as CBRE, BakerTilly, JLL, and Cushman & Wakefield (2) Role of the liquidator is purely to execute steps according to judicial process and state laws and all documentations and data involved in the process is out in the public (3) which we are more than happy to let Maker appoint a third party to take on and/or let Maker appoint a third party to supervise such process In fact, Robinland\u2019s role is similar to an Arranger: we\u2019ve set up a structure that is robust enough to include a large number of commercial real estate debt assets, mitigating Maker\u2019s risk as outlined above, and also saving Maker from labor-intensive work by taking on that in-house. This means we are a financial service provider that can serve as the bridge between Trad-Fi and DeFi specialized in the real estate industry for the benefit of both parties (project suppliers and liquidity suppliers)  At a more conceptual level, I see two ways of reducing risk for Maker (1) an automated system such as a DST structure (proposed in the 6s capital case) (2) high-quality inputs (e.g. first lien real estate debt that come with full-recourse rights) into such system. If I may, let me use concepts in Machine Learning for an analogy: a good model and good data are equally important for a good outcome, but if one has to choose, the input is more important (\u2018garbage in, garbage out\u2019 principle). As a data science practitioner in the past, I also see that even at top tech firms, ML are usually done with very simple model, e.g. a 3-layer tower, plus extremely good data. When it comes to Real World Asset, the principle is similar: a very well structured system definitely is an extra layer of protection, but if (not saying Maker will, just hypothetically) the Arrangers lacked industry specific connections/knowledge and brought in underlying assets that weren\u2019t of high-quality, the well-structured system would spend all its resources dealing w/ foreclosures and defaults. After all, a combination of a well-structured system + high quality underlying asset (brought in via industry experts) is the way to go, and if anything, having the latter is a more fundamental way of solving the risk problem. That being said, we can definitely see why Maker might prefer a well structured system over picking-and-choosing of asset, as it\u2019s easier (from a DAO perspective) to set up one structure and re-use it in all use cases, regardless of the underlying asset. The drawback is, as a result, such system has to be set up in expectation of dealing with the worst, even if it means the cost and complexity of such structure isn\u2019t really justified in most cases where no default happened. We are also in the process of exploring a DST structure (evaluating its time and cost), and in the process of contacting the proposed Arrangers such that if and when the Arranger model is in place, we can move quickly to submit a new application under the new framework. However, we still believe that the currently proposed structure contain all the elements that ensure Maker\u2019s risk control needs, and if Maker has concerns, we\u2019re more than happy to discuss further and amend it to achieve an agreement!

I have some concerns Maker is going to dust limit itself out of users but don\u2019t see a lot of options here other than getting on a cheaper L2. As to DAI recoery.  I would have preferred to have a real set of criterion, fee, and response regarding people who have lost DAI they want recovered for multiple reasons both legal, and PR wise. Regarding delegate compensation I am convinced Maker needs to do better here.  MakerDAO is not bringing in significantly new MKR to governance and I don\u2019t see that the compensation is representative to what people are doing.  (GFX in particular).   Performance criterion also do not account for people being sick, or taking vacation.  In effect there is no grace period and if people can\u2019t get enough MKR to delegate to them they won\u2019t get much compensation. There is also a significant issue with distribution of governance power being aggregated to two delegates and when I look at the fact that basically 1 player is solely responsible for more than 50-75% of this delegated MKR it shows a kind of favoritism even in governance power being centralized to a few individuals.    A significant number of \u2018shadow delegates\u2019 are not even participating. It is my hope that a historical governance MKR analysis both from a MKR held and governance participation would be undertaken so MakerDAO can come to understand MKR holders and holder activites generally. I also have hope (given SES has made this a priority) that MakerDAO is able to reduce or eliminate fees for polling so we can get a first look on whether reducing costs will increase polling participation.

I want to re-iterate something I proposed a long time ago that would solve this problem. MKR seasoning proposal for system control access  - I believe due to the above this should be revisited.   This idea that \u2018rogue\u2019 Maker can just enter governance without a seasoning period is a bad idea.  I also believe that Maker would do well to make changes along with the above so actions designed to change the system require a slashable stake of MKR be put up against MP proposals, and executives so some punishment can be exerted should governance actions be considered frivolous or downright malicious   (slashing should be a last resort governance action btw). PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - January 17, 2022 - voted YES - I support the OMC proposed changes.

Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) - January 10, 2022 - switched from Abstain to NO here.   I was already leaning toward a NO vote - discussion and events caused me to take a position against off-boarding MKT-001.  Put simply I don\u2019t believe this group has gotten a fair chance and the characterization by @Deimos and @flipflopflapdelegate was basically \u2018out of the blue\u2019.  I will be supporting changes both to on-boarding and off-boarding so that clear CU deliverables and timelines are established and agreed to so CUs get a fair and honest chance at MakerDAO.  If people have issue with a CU it is my hope that we can have professional discussions leading to change vs. this adversarial mode people are MakerDAO are taking.   We really need a different way to process operational criticism in a way that is healthier for the people and the DAO. ",

Forgot to comment on the Emergency Executive:  Temporarily Prevent Surplus (flap) Auctions and MKR Burn - January 24, 2022 This emergency measure is the response to the inefficient flap auctions kicked off after the recent market drop and liquidation of over 140M in collateral.   The goal is to shut off flaps until the flapper could be addressed.   BTW:  This action does not address flopper issues which still exist as well.   @ultraschuppi wanted this to be 1B which I would have supported.  Conceptually if one is going to take action do it decisively.  1B would have been more than enough to stop flaps.  250M currently will still allow flaps should Maker have another event that liquidates roughly 1.3-1.4B of collateral with 13% fee collected.     We have about 4B worth of collateral left which if liquidated would yield a SB of over 560M if liquidated with 13% fees (unlikely).   Hence Maker could still end up flapping poorly here if the protocol liquidated 1/3 of available collateral. Also if the DeFI markets experience another price shock it could lead to cascading liquidations and this could lead to surplus buffer losses and the need to flop.   No-one is addressing the flopper having to be halted for an entire week during Black Thursday (to source DAI bidders and liquidity) to cover a mere 6.5M DAI and how the same ineffective and inefficient system sits today as the means to recapitalize deficiencies in the surplus.  Core Unit Budget Transfers and Streams - January 28, 2022 - Executive Support everything except the Oracle budget repaying the Foundation.    To date there has been absolutely no information regarding the accounting for the Foundation, nor of the disposition of assets that belong to Maker into other \u2018companies\u2019.   This lack of transparency isn\u2019t just concerning but at least in the US possibly illegal.   There are many reasons these various entities have incorporated in the Cayman Islands\u2026 Interestingly I think there are good reasons the European Union \" On 7 January 2022, the European Commission adopted a draft Delegated Regulation (the \"Draft Regulation\") updating its list of \u2018high-risk third countries\u2019 (\u201cEU AML List\u201d) identified as having strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing (\u201cAML/CFT\u201d) regimes1.\" This lack of accountability and transparency by the Foundation, directors, and owners of associated affiliates illustrates directly how the directors of various interested Maker parties have avoided financial transparency.   This lack of transparency stands in stark contrast to the intention to help save the world from \u2018global climate change\u2019 and puts into question the kind of leadership Maker is intending for the space.

Stables are rapidly approaching 62% of all DAI which is concerning. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - January 31, 2022 - Voted YES -   People who use Maker vaults are not rate sensitive here and will generally NOT be minting more DAI or levering up.  In fact most of them are paying down loans because this is the best way to improve vault health because we all share a concern that Inflation (or the lack of CBs really addressing inflation) is going to overshadow markets.   There is a general concern that if we have one or more bad days with crypto already down 40% or more across the board off highs another 25-30% drop could put us into a cascading liquidation mode. The rest is pretty basic stuff I don\u2019t have too much issue with.   Raising the ES given the recent borrowing events to pass certain polls illustrates how easily governance could be manipulated by larger players.    There are significant issues that would crop up should an ES be triggered that should not be treated lightly.   I do believe when one has put in a important feature (like the ES) that one should test whether it can actually be activated in a timely fashion (particularly when changing the threshold) and the implications on all parties should it not be quickly triggered or whether it should be triggered at all. Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-NOTE (2 to 10 Year Duration US Treasury Securities) - January 24, 2022 - Voted NO Given the significant and growing exposure to stablecoins I welcome @GFXlabs work to bring these forward.  While I think longer term notes held to maturity are interesting and would give decent return there is some concern over holding longer term notes to maturity. Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-TBILL (US Treasury Securities Up To 12 Months Duration) - January 24, 2022 - Voted YES Supporting this greenlight does not mean this will get passed.  I honestly want to send a message to relevant CUs to start looking at something and feel shorter term notes should be easier to approach.   Cycling the capital through term expiring should be straightforward.  My only concern is cost to bring DAI back (my expectation is this cost is going to be between 5-10bps which is significant).   Even so I would like to send a signal for RWF and Risk to at least take a look.   The primary reason is that I don\u2019t see any discussion of anything for the DAO to offload some of the USDC risk from the protocol.   I understand conflict of interest concerns, as well as wanting a bigger more experienced player to take this on, but important Maker players have significant conflicts of interest across the board (much not disclosed btw), at least @GFXlabs has been quite forward about this, and I don\u2019t see any bigger players moving forward here.

In this case even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate I would have been voting my MKR yes here.  I agree with GovAlpha that governance giving delegates compensation shows it is serious about how important governance is to the proper functioning of Maker and compensating delegates is getting us governing talent that otherwise may be going elsewhere. Offloading TUSD-A - February 7, 2022 - After discussing this with @ultraschuppi somewhat I am convinced the quickest and easiest path for all concerned here is to - liquidating first, do nothing second, and PSM third which is how I VOTED here mostly because I\u2019d rather avoid engineering to have to get in here to maybe save us 100K when they have more important things which can yield a much greater value to MakerDAO on their plates at the moment.  While I am sensitive to the concerns of the TUSD team here it is my own opinion we move on from TUSD at the moment.   Doesn\u2019t mean we might not consider adding this again in the future, but right now it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep this on the books. Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper - February 7, 2022 - voted YES - Even though I am rapidly turning more for building a SB, DAO owned MKR-DAI LP than flapping IF we are going to keep the flapper active we should put in rate control.   My question is whether the flopper needs this as well?!   I also believe we should really look at a longer term plan regarding flapping excess cash as I see building Uniswap v2 MKR-DAI LP as a far superior way to effectively reward MKR holders than just sinking and burning MKR.  As we saw from black thursday if the protocol had 5-10% of assets in a DAO treasury we could have borrowed 6M DAI to cover losses instead of flapping 20K MKR with a 320M Market cap loss and paid this 6M DAI back in less than 6months saving the protocol over 10M DAI. Put simply Maker is rapidly approaching the point that liquidity is so limited and there is so much DAI out there that if we had to flop again we would lose at least 1B in Market cap to cover as little as 100M in protocol losses (flopping say 40M worth of MKR).

I want to thank GovAlpha and @prose11 especially for bringing the Signal Request forward [Signal Request] MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp and the overwhelming positive support to pass this from everyone.   If there was something to urge with respect to delegate performance here it is an idea that delegates should be able to get 1 or more passes on a particular poll set or executive.   Think of this like like sick or vacation time.  When you need it - you really want/need it and you want to know you won\u2019t lose community support if you absolutely need time off for any reason. Beyond that want to express a sincere appreciation for the Maker DAO as a community as people here really do express caring and concern for each other and that comes through more often than not.   This along with the sheer challenge of being in a DAO are the prime reasons I am still here. Community Greenlight Poll - PUNK (NTFX CryptoPunk) - February 21, 2022 - Voted NO on this mostly because of the additional PE work required and the fact even in the best case presented this likely can\u2019t/won\u2019t be profitable to the protocol anytime soon.   I think the NFT growth has been amazing but Maker has more important things to get going first (RWF/RWA) and increasing DAI adoption in the space in significant ways.   I really think RWF/RWA at this point should be our first priority and in time as Maker takes advantage of low hanging fruit and resources become available we can reconsider things like the above proposal.

                    "content": "Delegate Communication 20220226_1156UTC  GUSD PSM Maximum Debt Ceiling Increase, MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Compensation - February 25, 2022 Supported  - This proposal only has two elements GUSD DC increase from 10-50M, and my own compensation.   I saw no reason to abstain since the poll for my retroactive compensation passed, and while unfortunate that the GUSD usage dropped from being maxed out at 10M to near 0 usage not a reason to block the executive going up on the GUSD DC. A general statement about 3F blocking and a delay in my own compensation.  I am unconcerned about the compensation being delayed and a bit more concerned about a single delegate dictating flow.  3F had ample time to bring up concerns during polling and as far as I can see the only issue is that the DC which was maxed out at the time this poll was brought up has basically been drawn down.   Is this really a reason not to have a 50M DC.  Is there some new existential risk brought to bear here with GUSD that we were previously unaware of at 10M DC?   My concern is we send the wrong message to Gemini, but given the DC is low while unfortunate not the end of world from an operational Maker perspective.  From the Press and Optics one though probably more of a negative than a positive. I am going to make a general statement to reiterate my stance on the PSMs.   I believe that tin/tout of 0 was and is a bad move for Maker for many reasons elicited above.  I felt so strongly I attempted to block an executive.   I still feel the same way and will add that Maker by \u2018being the market\u2019 and not putting a minimum fee friction on these would do well to consider a D3M type approach to capture USDC, USDP, GUSD price drops below $1 on markets.   In fact such a beast would be a great service for USDC, USDP, GUSD open market PEG maintenance of other stablecoins (made by Maker for DeFI).   Actually use our own 0 fee reserves to arbitrage other stablecoin PEGs. I still believe a +/- 2-5bps tin/tout would be appropriate since if my numbers are correct Maker is going to rapidly be approaching not just being cash generation neutral but likely to go negative here (given the high expenses) within 4-8 weeks at current rate of loss on assets paying fees and the cost of oracles.   I can already see my only current vault UNIV2ETHUSDC going to be pushed out because it won\u2019t be generating enough revenue when in fact Maker should be seriously considering adjusting how oracles operate on assets that are coupled with stablecoins (which are price pegged to 1 in the protocol btw) when they have sqrt the underlying price volatility and a 13% liquidation price buffer (this turns into a 26% price change on the floating LP component btw - not one person both in risk or anywhere else realizing this key point about how the 13% fee is a 2x price change buffer on UNIv2TOKENSTABLES). The idea that @flipflopflapdelegate would stand against (by leaving his MKR on a previous executive to block the current) the current proposal is almost funny when Maker is losing TVL, and revenue, and DAI only hit 10B because we got to 5B of USDC, 500M of USDP, and at the time of discussing raising GUSD DC from 10M to 50M was also pegged at 10M. Perhaps it would be prudent for governance to look at the larger picture and take some firm stances on serious issues to the protocol than ones that do virtually nothing to the bottom line and actually take away from Maker the ability to partition stablecoin risk with more players. Last point on this topic.  I find it ironic the machinations Maker is going through on RWA to be \u2018perfect\u2019 when we have almost 6B of stablecoins in the protocol.   We have to debate ad nauseum whether to add bonds (these are tricky) vs. just adding a trustee that can take 4-5B worth of stablecoins and convert them to USD (or other useful assets) and steward over them for DAI holders reducing (and if possible eliminating) the existential risk to Maker and reducing the possibility of losses to DAI holders. Maker literally is now at the point that the biggest issue isn\u2019t growing DAI, but managing the growing centralization threat of the collateral backing DAI (from USDC, to wBTC, to USDP) to Maker existence.  As a vault owner who in the past shorted DAI when price was above PEG borrowing and selling DAI for \u2018other stuff\u2019 using collateral and a vault is the only way I can short the PEG as a DAI short.  I use the least risky vault to the protocol allowing me the possibility I can buy DAI should the DAI PEG (for any reason) ever fall through the floor.  So I can act as a incentivized automated agent to buy back DAI giving some minimum volume price support (at whatever price I choose and am able to cover my DAI loan).  But vault owners no longer have sufficient collateral ammo to cover the huge threats to DAI. Take away my UNIV2 vault and I will no longer be willing or able to be one of a few agents to support DAI to any significant level should (for any reason) one of these centralized threats materialize.   Also given MKR market cap is now below 2B I would not expect flopping MKR to provide more than 200-500M worth of loss coverage and this should be of significant concern to MKR as well as DAI holders.

Also changes to AAVEv2 D3M DC from 220-300M, gap 60-65M, and Target Borrow Rate (bar) from 3.5 to 2.85% These should all be positive for Maker as we are looking to grow collateral (staked ETH is good for borrowers to use because it has a built in return for them.  In general collateral types that earn return are good for vault owners, and the protocol as many of these earn a higher return than the current stability fee).  Regarding AAVE D3M changes these look to be good as they will bring D3M online with AAVE earning a decent return. It is my hope that Maker focus on doing a Compound D3M as well because this appears to be the next low hanging D3M fruit.   After that it would be AAVE on Avalance as over 1B DAI there are earning a combined 4% return right now. Adding Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions - February 28, 2022 - supported - YES This will improve flap auctions so that should the protocol end up with excess Surplus (right now we have to be over 250M) we will get better flap performance. A general comment regarding flapping and Maker surplus and budget.   Maker revenues are slated to decline between 1.2-2.5M/month within the next few months as Nexo moves its borrowing to the institutional vault.    Expenses (removing liquidations) and including MKR vesting is now running almost equal with revenues.  Put simply in very short order here Maker is going to be looking at a shrinking surplus buffer and if MakerDAO + CUs don\u2019t find ways to either reduce expenses or grow revenues we are going to be looking at flopping MKR to pay expenses. I have been a strong proponent of building a treasury of assets that we can use with vaults as an additional DAI resource to backstop flopping.  Until we build such a treasury and/or the surplus buying MKR is literally the worst thing MakerDAO can do with spare cash at this time.   The surplus buffer is what we pay expenses, and as the buffer to risk events and until MakerDAO realizes building a treasury (to have collateral earning return that we can borrow DAI against) it is our only capital asset at this time (beyond MKR in the treasury or via mint). All of the above in the face of increasing expenses is not setting a good trajectory for Maker financially and will need to be dealt with sooner not later with expense reductions. ",

Continuing the process for offboarding TUSD.  : A firm no on reinstating the surplus buffer LERP Reinstate surplus buffer LERP For a long time I have been not just an advocate of an expanded surplus buffer, but building a Treasury as a secondary surplus buffer.   If Black Thursday taught us anything it is that having assets to use in the protocol to borrow DAI to fill a hole is much more cost effective than flopping low and flapping high which is precisely what these are doing.   Maker has wasted not just time debating but now 10\u2019s of Millions of DAI basically expanding and then trying to contract Maker float for MKR holders. I want to be clear here.   I understand MKR holders want to see the platform buying MKR.  As of today our revenues are rapidly on the decline and growth is confined predominantly to non SF paying PSMs while our ETH market share in particular is decreasing.   Maker in the success of reaching not just 1B DAI but 10B DAI seems to be lost in a daze of success that really is bounding on failure.   The failures are the inability to adapt and to take advantage of changing market conditions (put simply Maker is not nimble or quick), and there is a distinct inability to look at the bigger picture as there is no single CU tasked with any form of managing Maker from greater perspectives in time, and effort. Everyone is poking the Maker horse in different ways, this creates a distinct directionless feel to the increasing activities draining everyone\u2019s productivity in the attempt to deal with giving energy to every poke, vs. being focused on Maker\u2019s low hanging fruit or working in a well coordinated fashion on long and short term goals. My own take on the surplus here is that Maker needs to grow this but it isn\u2019t going to grow because expenses are going up (dramatically so) and revenues are dropping (almost dramatically so).   Hence the reasons for bringing to CUs now the question of how to deliver critical services on 1/4 to 1/2 their requested budgets much less why NOT to grow now.   I want to grow but we need to do this in a more cost effective manner. I don\u2019t want to buy 1 MKR with DAI at this point. In fact I want to be creating a MKR-R rewards token with something like 10B-1T float.  Back a v2 UNI MKRRDAI with about 5-10M DAI and about 5-10M MKR-R (for a launch price determined by MKR to be 1DAI/MKR-R) to give Maker a rewards token that:  Finally breaks Maker out of the capitalization trap potentially freeing us from the flop/flap value model. (not being able to issue more MKR, much less sell it to raise DAI) Creates a reward token with a 10B to 1Trillion book value that can be used to incentivize vaults (in particular TOKEN-DAI UNI v2 types) Can be used to construct negative interest rates without devaluing or diluting DAI collateral backing. In conjunction with a larger plan for vaults (2) as well as new initiatives to grow DAI, create a new buzz around the Maker ecosystem. Demonstrate to the DeFI world that Maker can float and back a 1Trillion value token while supercharging DAI and revenue growth to sustain it.  In summary MKR-R farming token would finally put Maker on the yield farming Map and it gives governance and risk another independent knob to manage capital flows and a fresh token start to manage tokenomics around Maker.  Using MKRRDAI UNISWAP v2 liquidity management against all other uses (novel governance, tokenomics, rates, TVL increase, DAI borrowing increases, etc.) would bring another much needed tool and significant value increase to Maker. The end analysis here after being swayed by the many voices desiring to burn Maker is that I now believe Maker is not generating value by flapping for MKR holders but in fact wasting this value.   Maker needs to focus less on the MKR value and focus more on building protocol value - so we would never need to flop again and instead of buying MKR we build robust markets to sell MKR and MKRR into to be able to raise capital.   Then put together liquidity so Maker buys MKR and MKRR low and sells it higher. This is why at this time I will no longer support bringing back the burn.  In fact at this point I considered even doing the PECU lerp work a waste of resources because I think we can construct far better ways to buy MKR low and sell it high. Example: a Uniswap v3 vault paired with 8M DAI set to buy MKR down to 1000 and sell MKR all the way through 10000 as a way for the community to earn some return, provide liquidity across a price band.   Given the limited liquidity in v3 doing this in the .05% feel price band would probably incentivize much greater trading.  Couple this with a vault for MKRDAI v2 and MKRR rewards for such a vault and this is a fabulous way to kickstart trading.    BTW:  I am still for a v2 MKRDAI vault because this is designed to have liquidity across the entire price range (up and down). These are examples of how Maker can do much better with respect to creating MKR liquidity for trading, and to build a treasury that can be used to borrow DAI to fill any surplus holes.   I am also convinced this strategy should be used for ETH as well since Maker uses ETH not just for oracles but all other work \u2026 ",

My biggest concern with a growing documentation and promotional material base will be maintenance and consistency across documents.  Hence I encourage a versioning number on each document that include a document master date code with a document version number (ccyymmdd.master_version code-ccyymmdd.slave_version) as well as a slave date codes and version number\u2026   The point here is to track inconsistency in the documents not assume consistency.   Using a master/slave version with datecodes provides all the relevant information to a user about whether a document is up to date with the current master or not.  Support Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount (MIP4c3-SP1) - March 14, 2022 - This suggests a language change (remove no more than) to clarify bounty amounts on a particular class of critical bug bounty from <=50k to =50K.  : EDITED 20220328_0156UTC Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) - March 14, 2022 - Original:  The process is sufficient for larger bug bounty payouts but needs to be changed for smaller bug bounties.  This MIP includes language to support faster payouts for smaller bounties.   Faster payouts on smaller bug bounties will encourage people to look for and report smaller issues.  In the end this makes for better Maker portals. Edited: While I support the fast payment of small bug bounties (which is why I first voted yes) I missed the significant increase in budget slid in with this proposal. I agree with @GFXlabs it is entirely unclear why it costs an additional 1.38M to pay out small bug bounties. In short this is a significant budget increase without justification so I switched my initial yes vote to a no vote.  Support Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) - March 14, 2022 - The budget request here is probably asking for the lowest yr/yr increase (about 3%) 1076800 to 1109793 and is switched to an annual request.   This budget request lists deliverables and timelines.  GovAlpha has been the only CU to return excess DAI funds twice now.   This unit works tirelessly in a high demand state to keep the glue of MakerDAO governance turning and has done so consistently since Rich was here @LongForWisdom  is one of the most level headed, well stated CU facilitators that is both proactive and reactive to the changing dynamics of the DAO.   While at times there has been some - off the cuff dramatics - in general the GovAlpha CU has and is doing a fabulous job with the budget given.   They have been expansive in goals, but conservative in budget.   It is why I am supporting this proposal and the next one.   The MKR vesting being asked for is the lowest of any of the CUs and demonstrates to me the real eye GovAlpha has towards being a long term sustainable and reliable CU.   While there are a number of other Core Units that I feel similarly about this one with the 3% raise (below inflation as a total) is keeping on track.  If there is one CU that I feel like would and could take a pay cut and still be extremely effective it is GovAlpha. I have only one request on budget requests - please include a summary statement of the previous budget request + actual spend as compared to the new budget request in a matrix format as it helps me understand all changes from past to current when I see them as line items in a matrix.

Struggling quite a bit with what to do about some of the significantly expanded budgets so I am still reviewing requests.    I have started a thread/post regarding the issues with budgets and suggestions for straight foward changes to the polling process around budgets to give governance some better control over the on-going costs vs. the costs to grow/expand.     RFC Budget request MIP - Break on-going from expansion budget requests. Budget Polling to RCV Governance       Dealing with budget requests.  I want to be clear here.   It is my preference to have sufficient funds to fund a lot of growth.    At some point if we don\u2019t have funds not just for growth but also for ongoing operations we are going to have to find expense cuts.  I did not write this as a MIP because I believe it needs discussion first but the intent is to turn this into a MIP that alters the budget request and polling process.

Not Supported Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) - March 14, 2022 - I have a number of issues.   Size of increase - lack of any real report regarding costs against what has been done.   There is between 5-12 projects in various states.  Two of which are claimed to be able to come on line within the next 1-3 months which indicate current funds are adequate for quite a lot of work.   I still don\u2019t have any resolution regarding status of Centrifuge and 6s, are these winding down,  are the DCs going to expand.  which, when and how.   To put this as simply as possible I keep getting replies but I don\u2019t appear to be getting answers that provide clarity. This is a huge increase in budget that is not backed by any material data regarding ability to execute, nor given the size of this increase is there any remarks regarding return to the DAO for the huge increase in expense.   Worse this is coming at a time that revenues are shrinking.   I would have preferred a measured increase with a set of actual deliverables over the next 3 months vs. what was proposed.  I would encourage RWF team to resubmit a 3month budget with a lower amount.  Supported Declaration of Intent \u2013 Invest in Short-Term Bonds I think MakerDAO will find that investing in bonds will prove hazardous in different ways (liquidity cycling, and overall fees/costs) BUT I believe it is important to task CUs to looking at this.   In short I don\u2019t expect this to provide much revenue (and in fact may cost Maker depending on the implementation) but we need to take a look.  Supported Facilitators Offboarding: SHOP-001 - Switched from Abstain to Yes given the facilitators appear to want to voluntarily step down anyway.  Supported Onboard Gelato to the Keeper Network  Supporting this proposal as it would add Gelato to the MIP63 Keeper Network.  This included a 1000DAI/day budget (365K DAI/yr).   While gas costs are currently low they would likely be much higher when liquidations are needed.  The costs of having a keeper network would be subsidized with a maximum 20K DAI buffer.  Given what happened in the past with Black Thursday we know the importance of incentivizing keeper networks.  SupportedOnboard Keep3r to the Keeper Network  - See comments regarding Gelatio while this keeper network runs on its own formally adding this network and providing some support will help the keeper network generally.  Changed previous YES to NO Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties  - While I support the fast payment of small bug bounties (which is why I first voted yes) I missed the significant increase in budget slid in with this proposal.  I agree with @GFXlabs it is entirely unclear why it costs an additional 1.38M to pay out small bug bounties.  In short this is a significant budget increase without justification so I switched my initial yes vote to a no vote.  Abstained MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation  - To be clear I support MakerDAO delegate compensation even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate.  I believe the work done by delegates is needed and in fact compensation is still too low for the work many delegates do.  I would have switched from Abstain to Yes to pass this, BUT I believe when it comes to conflict of interest voting such as this proposal it is the IOU/MKR holders that need to vote and decide these polls NOT delegates.   My intention is to abstain from these kinds of conflict of interest votes in the future because I believe delegates should not be put into conflict of interest positions.  Point of note here I am still waiting for a polling mechanism to be created that uses some form of snapshot so we can determine if MKR voting is a cost issue or not.   We could use this snapshot to poll MKR holders directly on conflict of interest issues for ALL delegate issues. Lastly:  Supported Authorizing the ESM on DssFlash and Adding Support for TUSD Implementation - March 25, 2022 - This executive has two primary components - disabling the ability of governance to enable the flash loans during executive shutdown, and re-enabling TUSD support.   Two comments here.   I thought it was interesting that PE missed the ES component on the flash loans on first pass (suggests PE can still miss some things), but that the fact it was caught so fast shows PE is constantly looking over Maker smart contracts.  Tells me two things.   People can make mistakes, but that Maker is constantly effectively auditing to try to catch this stuff.   As to TUSD I think it is great we catch these kinds of changes.  Being one that caught the bad end of the Gnosis Chain bridge token contract fiasco by losing funds in Agave such hacks show how important it is to review token additions to any network. ",

I honestly would have come down with a NO.   Reasoning.   That it was clear that CUs already committed MakerDAO to this event, with the asked for funding\".   I agree with @JustinCase that inherently saying yes to this sets a bad precedent that CUs can do what they want and that governance just will rubber stamp their choices.    If this comes under CU independent action and mandate then perhaps the funding should have come out of the relevant CU budgets instead of a governance budget request.   Reasoning on abstaining is that a yes approves this kind of budgeting behavior (which I consider to set a bad precedent), No would say that I don\u2019t want to see these events.  Neither of which is my stance on this issue.

Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp3-ethamsterdam-event-spf/13781   Sentence Summary The purpose of this sub proposal is to a\u2026      Supported Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge - March 28, 2022 - I felt this 5M DAI limit wasn\u2019t really supported.  I also have some concern that if these funds are lost in the bridge that Maker will be asked to \u2018compensate\u2019 for losses which is the reason I would have like to see some comment on what the minimum was.   I support proceeding with StarkNet bridge, but I want to be clear that no real justification for the 5M was made anywhere AFAIK.   If Maker is not going to be on the hook for loss of funds then this is a non-issue, if MakerDAO IS going to be on the hook here then some discussion of why 5M was the minimum necessary liability for inception should have been brought forward.    Put simply I didn\u2019t feel these issues were sufficient to say no to initial parameters and these ofc can be adjusted.  Which brings a question of whether the limit can be lowered below the amount of DAI in the bridge while the bridge is processing.  Supported Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) - March 28, 2022 - This is just some MIP housekeeping to remove references to off boarding a specific CU (MKT-001).  Abstained Investigate Implementation of a Notional Finance D3M - March 28, 2022 - If I was to come down Yes/No I would have come down with a Yes.   Reasons.  This poll was to simply \u2018investigate\u2019 vs. \u2018prioritize\u2019.  Though honestly even the handling of the wording of this poll throughout process was non-standard imo.   I found that an extra 30-50K MKR that came out to weigh both Yes and No on this proposal itself to be interesting as well as informative as to the state of Maker governance.  I was personally lobbied to vote one way or another on this issue by more individuals than on any other issue.   In the end given this was simply an \u2018intent\u2019 which should lead CUs to produce a set of reports both risk and technical (not an actual onboarding.  ) that I expected to go into the already long CU work queues the sheer interest, both pro and con here, was almost over the top from a political perspective given the actual implications to the protocol.    This gives me significant concern about what happens when even more important issues that divide the community need to be decided. ",

The original report didn\u2019t have much supporting data.  Subsequent comments did, but it still looks like Maker is losing the competitive edge to Aave, etc. Some good comments from @GFXlabs    GFX Labs Delegate Platform   A wider discussion about fiscal discipline is necessary in the face of market headwinds.   I am going to add here that while discussion regarding how to handle budgets is going on, and a new MIP40 is submitted that I believe it is time for at least one delegate to put their foot down on these constantly expanding CU budget requests.    Here on out I will be voting NO to all budget requests that ask for expansions in headcounts, funds, new things whatever.    REASONS:   Every CU acting in their own self interest when promoting a new expansion is fine, doing it within their own on-going budget requests is absolutely out of line.  Bundling these requests with on-going budget requests doesn\u2019t allow for the DAO (CUs, delegates, and governance proper) to discuss and prioritize where to grow the protocol in a collaborative way but is instead a free for all on which CU can either bully or coax governance to accept their pet expansion request.   ALL expansion requests need to be gathered quarterly or semiannually into a \u2018CU wish list\u2019 and ordered with a cost component, time to complete, what we get, and how we measure success (KPI, etc.)   Point here is everyone should be able periodically to put ideas into a how we need to grow bucket, with details of costs, execution time, and KPIs as well as ROI so the entire DAO can mull these over and do a ranked choice poll on what we feel is important.  Then these can go to governance formally.  Put simply it is fairer if the community look at growth from a community point of view vs. the singular CU point of view on their own interests.   There is absolutely no way to get on-going expenses under control, much less what is actually being done for the expense being paid.  Until Maker formally breaks expansion budget requests from on-going we will have absolutely no way to know how to balance costs much less reign them in.  IF it takes governance saying no to expanding budgets to get CUs in line, then so be it.  I want CUs to put forward ideas, but I want CUs to be maximizing what they do with what they have now before asking for more, which has become the constant budget meme.   Finally, when I look out as what Maker has planned, being worked on, at a minimum governance needs to see a list of all the things being worked on, along with some cost estimates for work upcoming to complete by relevant CUs (i.e. % of total budget allocated to get item X done, by when?) and then for someone - anyone (one or more) to come up with actual ROI estimates on what completing these will give as a return in 12months so governance can formally use a RCV to prioritize CU efforts on tasks, as well as think about new tasks to lay before CUs. I also want to see every MIP have a basic discussion about IF implemented what this MIP will provide in terms of a 12 month ROI, and when being evaluated or commented on how much it will cost each CU to investigate/implement, as well as a wall clock time estimate (inside and outside) for how much calendar time it will take for CU to complete their work.  Supported Launch Maker Wormhole With Optimism and Arbitrum Domains - April 4, 2022 - With 2M total 1M+1M for Optimism and Arbitrum seems reasonably conservative for the launch.   I think the ROI here is likely low for the effort but I support the wormhole initiative in the hopes that it could become a better bridge with a potential for real revenue generation, vs. just a way to promote DAI (PR vs. real revenue generator).

Supported Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022 - I have some questions regarding the mandates of CES but I am in support of formally adding this team.  My hope is this team keeps a laser focus on operating budgets and their role as mandated actor in the MakerDAO ecosystem.  (These are initial comments here and may be updated/edited)  Supported Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022 - While not perfect, and could use some work, is a nice next step in the types of information needed when onboarding collateral.   Expect more on this topic as I review more carefully these changes looking to give input on the next iteration of the process methodology and informational criterion required for a MIP6 application.  Supported Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) - April 11, 2022 - Like GOVCOMM updated mandate.  I support improved CU mandates, but at this time for reasons below will be denying expanded budget requests. Let\u2019s get the easier No\u2019s out of the way.  Not Supported Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) - April 11, 2022. - I was quite vocal against DECO.  My reasons were that Maker could easily do fixed rate vaults for clients, and Maker didn\u2019t need to open up a regulatory rats nest by providing a fixed rate instrument (this comes directly under SEC jurisdiction in the US, which would mean geofencing of the product).  The price like Deco comes in very high at 8M in MKR, and 15% fees, for something that very few seem interested in.  Put simply it is a product that Maker doesn\u2019t need, that has a very high price tag attached, that has little interest from investors at this point.   I am always willing to hear cogent arguments against my views but so far have not heard any really good reason.  The fact we already are paying Deco is like - if we have one - why do we need two fixed rate products? Now to a whole slew of expansion budget requests that I am denying on a matter of principle.  I have requested that CUs break on-going from expansion budgets and only one CU did this (David I want to thank you for doing this and will explain why I voted no to your on-going request after these). I believe that MakerDAO the ORG of CUs, delegates, and MKR holders (as well as DAI holders even if we don\u2019t hear from them) should have a say so in every quarter putting forward ideas for where to grow.  These I consider \u2018expansion requests\u2019 as distinctly different from on-going operations.  This involves all kinds of new ideas.  My Maker3.0 proposal, The aggressive growth strategy, Singularity project, Events, DIN growth, PE growth, COMMs growth, anything that is adding to current things Maker does, or added features (like say delegates ask for a MIP to include travel funds, SSI, MKR vesting, health benefits etc for delegates - I mean like why not right).   The point here is all of these better things should be put before everyone at least 1 month before the quarterly review, and we all sit down and look at what the global budget should do, and whether we have room for an expansion budget. Then MakerDAO can do two things  If there is no expansion budget shelve all expansion requests to next quarter. If there is an expansion budget have the DAO in the forums rank choice vote on all budget expansion requests (these should have a time frame to completion and ROI estimates if implemented - even if negative).   Do the same RCV on expansion budget.   Take the ones and amounts that make \u2018consensus\u2019 and put them up for on-chain governance poll to be approved for implementation or not.   I would like my RCV 100%, 95%, 90%, etc funding levels to be included.  Point above is that I believe it is unfair for the DAO to consider these expansion requests independently and believe they need to be put together into a package so PE can look at what GOVCOMMs is asking for, or DIN, or EVENTs, etc. and look at these requests in conjunction with funding so WE ALL can decide as a collective how much, and where to grow next. For the above reasons I am rejecting all budgets that have growth components and requesting all CUs to resubmit their on-going budgets and to put forward their expansion requests for the next quarterly evaluation either on 6/1 or 7/1 this year. I also am letting the community know that while I am making a definitive statement about process here I am going to back it with NO votes until CUs and the DAO brings forward at least a first version of budgeting process here that segregates on-going expenses from wish list expansion budget requests. Hence for above reasons of fairness, and seeking a better process I am rejecting ALL of the following budget requests.  Not Supported - Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - April 11, 2022  Not Supported - Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) - April 11, 2022  Not Supported - Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) - April 11, 2022  Not Supported - Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022 Now to the harder ones I voted NO on.  Not Supported - Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022 - I appreciate the work done by RWF here with the proposed Methodology for SFT and think this was a fantastic step forward.  The sheer length of this document and the short RFC period made it impossible for me to comment in detail to get some clarity in this document and to deal with some issues.   The clarity is about what is a SFT - I don\u2019t think these were well defined in the document, and one other issue that stuck out was in the methodology that was related to RWA Asset Originators having a significant history (thinking if we adopt this it will basically kill Centrifuge/NewSilver, 6s, and certainly Monetalis).   After looking at this lengthly comprehensive document I realized I would have to spend more time on this before I could even make commentary.   One thing I think everyone has to realize here.  RWF documents - pretty much across the board require at least 10-30x more time to review than almost every other document.  Put simply I could spend a week or two going through these documents and associated links and then another week or two just thinking about them before being able to make decent suggestions on change.  The fact so few people commented and there was so little time to me means while important these do need a bit more time.  Is it a reason to say no.  Not really.  It was basically the concerns that if we adopt this methodology that the lack of clarity in some respects will lead to gaming and other issues later, and that some statements stood out as red flags to toss out our currently approved AOs with vaults give me pause for concern.   It is likely I will add here as I read through these more carefully but will likely post in the threads. Finally - David I promised I\u2019d come back to why I voted NO on your on-going budget request (thank you for taking initiative on this - GOVCOMMs along with GOVALPHA pretty much are high on my list of CUs really trying to do right things and I wanted you to know from me I appreciate this very much!)  Not Supported Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP62) - April 11, 2022 - Why?   30% budget increase red - flagged me here.   It made me look a lot more carefully at why a 158K increase on a 515K previous budget.   The standouts.  8-80K for operations.  This is a 1% to almost 16% cost component that really is huge. This seems like a huge jump here (while you try to explain it - the sheer size of this one component needs to be dealt with in some other way).  It made me wonder what the hell happened last year (do that again or something).   Then heaped in here is taxes (which I presume is SSI or something like it), and we heap on top of this a 8% salary raise and 25K on 1FTE part time from 45K to 70K.   Then you bumped travel, while taking off legal.   When I look at this budget it feels like there is some padding going on beyond the contingency that is excessive.  If Maker has to deal with 30% on-going budget increases from all CUs - just to run here.   If you had somehow gotten this down to 15% with these contingencies and taken a hit somewhere to make it work while explaining I could swallow that budget even if I didn\u2019t like it.   30% is just over the top, and while I have other reasons to deny your expansion is yet another reason why I would not approve your expansion.  You are already adding to your expenses dramatically. I really want to urge CUs with these on-going budget requests - get your house in order now - if you messed up - you are going to have to take a hit so you don\u2019t end up submitting on-going budget increases of 15% or higher.  I want to see on-going budgets settle in to no more than COL or inflation adjusts so we can finally nail down the yearly budget so we all can figure out not just how much money we need to grow but how to spend that to get the ROI growth in revenues we need to cover the on-going costs associated with such growth. I apologize for length of this.  But as a delegate who see\u2019s himself as the governor for MKR holders I have to stick my foot down here on this out of control CU expense budget growth and the only way I know how to do that is by saying NO to requests that I feel are out of line and ask CUs to go back to the drawing board.  I realize other delegates may not support me.  I don\u2019t have enough Maker to dominate governance with my decisions but I am going to take what I do have and vote it as I see is in the best interests for ALL parties, not just MKR holders, but CUs, when it comes to fairness, and sustainable growth and I hope everyone appreciates the hard stance I am taking here and that MKR holders/delegates will support me in this move.   I am not warming up to get rid of CUs but I am putting CUs on notice - start getting your financial house in order, and yes please I want you to come forward with expansion requests and ideas, but back these with how this benefits us all and allow us all to weigh in together on how we grow this protocol.  It is time for us to come together as a community to create the tools we need to work in unison vs. 100\u2019s of people rowing at different rates in all different directions. ",

Regarding the PE request, we put quite a bit of effort into the team\u2019s plans, rationale, and justification on how to approach this growth - much of which was outlined in the PECU Workstreams post, in support of the Budget Request. It is interesting to note that the team\u2019s initial plan was to pursue an equivalent 2021 budget in 2022, however from forum discussion this year and subsequent in-person meetings in Denver, there was overwhelming support for the outlined initiatives, which I tried to capture in the above links. If yourself and other delegates are opposed to our approach and rationale (which is contingent on finding new hires in the specified areas) I would love to hear more feedback so we can ensure continuity in some form or another as there is much work underway as described across the various recent team posts.

                    "content": "Derek appreciate the comments. I think I have been very clear. I believe that all expansion requests by the entire DAO need to be put together into a quarterly bucket so the entire DAO can review them while also discussing on-going budgets and how much money can be brought forward for any expansion efforts  Expansion needs to be done via entire community, quarterly.  Ongoing - as it comes. Everyone gets all happy when they think they have a lot of money to work with and Maker at this point in time, without selling MKR or borrowing DAI, has a shrinking revenue pool to work with to grow much less back the system in case of losses.  Since ETHDenver the protocol has lost what 25-30% of revenue, and has seen expenses climb by almost the same amount (with no end in sight btw). I had to think about what to do here and I believe breaking on-going budget requests from expansion/growth requests IS THE ONLY way to get budgets under control and to bring the DAO together on growth initiatives.   I honestly DO NOT believe I will get enough support and this DAO is just going to keep increasing spending until we literally have to flop MKR low to raise cash or borrow DAI and by then things are going to get horribly ugly around this DAO unless a ton of cash falls on Maker from somewhere.   I have done this more times than I wish to admit with various intentional communities, and co-ops and am going to do everything I can to head this off now, and try to reset MakerDAO course financially to something \u2018manageable\u2019 that is NOT going to lead to \u2018financing crisis\u2019 if at all possible. I want PE to think about the manpower that frees up once D3M work is done, and perhaps L2\u2019s may not need to come in as quickly (I just don\u2019t think these are going to provide significant revenues so ROIs on L2 initiatives aren\u2019t going to be that high).   I see RWA/RWF as the critical side and Maker is throwing so much money there without too much real return in sight I don\u2019t see why Maker needs significant growth here much less where we get it from.   How much work will be needed by PE in this RWF arena, what are the other real initiatives that will require PE work coming up.  Maker3.0 actually was a longer term plan - as resources free up to work on something new while streamlining Maker2.0 btw. give everyone with idle time to propose new things to work on and talking about how to really supercharge Maker via incorporating new ideas in wide open Maker3.0 initiative. What Maker2.0 needs is \u2018Efficient growth\u2019, and growing as much productivity out of our limited funds.  If MakerDAO seriously considered my Maker3.0 initiative we\u2019d probably have significant opportunities to raise DAI via MKR3, create some new excitement around doing a second Maker that has a different focus on DAI (i.e. what DAI3 could be as well as MKR3) with some clarity on what markets thought and if Maker2.0/MKR governance found they had a significant asset on the books to build some DAI resources, a means to build a cooperative second future Maker3.0/DAI3 that had strong synergies and differences to current Maker2.0/DAI perhaps I would be more inclined to grow PE and a few other CUs btw.    I don\u2019t see any clarity here or any really serious initiatives to grow Maker to not 100B but to 1T and get us 1-10B of assets to work with (via surplus cash, and a real treasury earning 8-12% returns in defi like Karpatkey is doing for Gnosis). I am looking at bigger pictures here and I understand people have different views.  Been there done that for decades.   I see some difficult times ahead unless Maker gets its house in order, and the rowers pulling together vs. however, whenever and in whatever direction they want. I have not replied but I am a strong supporter of KISS principles and really liked what @iammeeoh  posted here.   Minimality - KISS principle There is so much going on everywhere it is becoming difficult just to keep up on it all (apologies luca for not having time to really review details on MIP67).   If we just keep doing this free for all on ideas and DO NOT start to separate what Maker needs to do from what everyone might want to do, this DAO, this project will get buried not being able to do anything.  I hate writing long posts explaining myself.  I like to keep things as short as possible, I no longer try to write up any proposals unless I feel they have a criticality and a significant positive result potential (high ROIs) that are easily actionable, most bang for the FTE buck.  Work insanely hard at one-page posts and limit these to maybe 1/day. I want to do things that are good for the world, but I am also aware that you can\u2019t do good, if you can\u2019t even pay the bills or keep the lights on.  I want to see Maker hunker down on what it needs to do, put CU/DAO ideas into a quarterly pot of initiatives so we all can discuss and rank these, decide, timelines, ROIs, funding and then move forward together.  Right now I see too many competing interests, too much \u2018incubation\u2019 and too little real execution on what we need and wish lists growing exponentially.   To be fair this isn\u2019t because of PE - I know your team is working its ass off with a heavy plate of stuff atm.   But I feel like this should ease up here, because I see nothing dramatically big that is coming up for PE to work on to justify hiring extra staff only to what have to lay them off in a year?   Explain what will require so much work once D3Ms are done and L2 briding/wormhole is pretty much done?   The rest of this will just be details of how to reach to an increasingly fragmented TVL space via more and more L2\u2019s sidechains, whatever. I personally would like to see a greater focus on Maker3.0 (don\u2019t care how it evolves) and how Maker can do a different and better DAI ala DAI3 and focus on using what we have now with Maker2.0 to be efficient.  Maker3.0 is freedom to finally so something really new, and big without any limitations, Maker2.0 has significant legacy and has the potential to be a reliable financial engine, DAI PEG to the $1USD has significant use.   Decouple two Maker systems and I am convinced the pair can be significantly stronger and much bigger, faster than the one. Until I see some real collaboration on the greater picture and, significant sustainable funding, I am putting the brakes on growth. ",

Pretty much everything coming from RWF here doesn\u2019t answer my simple questions, and leaves me with pages, and pages and verbosity, detail, to wade through.   To be fair much of it is important, and this requires some real time vs. the flash in the pan - I read it - its great - lets go and maybe one or two \u2018maybe change or consider this\u2019. As written by @iammeeoh I want to encourage everyone (I take this seriously myself) to focus on simplifying as much as possible, focus on the key issues, the minimum we need to move forward in the maximum ways possible.   This was why I was tempted to either abstain or put a pass on MIP67, but there were things that flagged me on caution - mostly a concern as to how methodology applied to current AOs with vaults would pretty much put them all out of the picture and some lack of clarity on what exactly is the definition of SFT is I simply decided to push pause here. Is this critical - probably not - so I am less concerned about governance just going against me here with caveat Maker really needs to consider carefully how to manage what we have, vs. tossing the old only to bring in the new.   I just have some significant concerns about how Maker is treating AOs generally, from the processing of them with some CUs not connected to RWF that has the goal to find the successful path, or letting them know graciously/professionally that what they bring is not a fit for MakerDAO and RWF team basically doing their hard work to either gate them in or gate them back to their steward with a real tangible, addressable list of items that IF addressed gets them an approval. Anything else is just more time, more verbiage, and more cost and frustration for all parties.  When I look at MIP67 I think how can this be clearer, simpler, shorter? ",

                    "content": "Thanks @MakerMan, I share your desire for simplicity and effectiveness myself. During the most recent months of my engagement with the community as prospective facilitator of Lending Oversight, I have tried to install in the teams what I have learned from 15 years in sophisticated finance. This includes the importance of good checks and balances, an open yet careful eye to what borrowers are proposing, and a pragmatic approach to \u201cget things done\u201d. Structuring and negotiation is way more boring than painting a bright decentralised and profitable future on forum, but not less important. For this reason, we have tried to educate, communicate, analyse, accelerate, as much as possible what was on RWF\u2019s table, in order to position the DAO in the best possible place to (i) avoid nasty surprises, (ii) growth in a healthy way by onboarding new real-world collateral. However, at the same time, as you know well, RWF-001 and others have been accused of lack of transparency over process and methodology, and lack of communication over prioritisation and existing activities. It is a difficult balance, but either one or the other. For this reason, the existing MIP67 (and underlying methodology) that I incentivised RWF-001 to put together and that I grandfathered in its content, goes in the direction of sharing what is happening behind the curtain while RWF-001 and others work on a proposal. We hope that this would act as a map for prospective counterparties who want to know what is Maker looking for with clarity and detail. We have received feedback that it does. Ultimately, we remain open for feedback and are looking forward to improve what we propose to the community. Independently from the outcome of MIP67, we will continue to do so. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - HVBANK (Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Collateral) - April 18, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight)  - Given the situation with existing RWA vaults and that this one appears to the the most likely to succeed it seems prudent to give CUs a greenlight to DD on this for the community.   Unless I see some significant issues within RWA proposals and the status of the pipeline I am going to greenlight whatever seems suitable for Maker and that has the greatest likelihood of succeeding.   I am going to turn down any proposals that don\u2019t look like they could complete in the market.  (i.e. proposals with really low return value relative to what I believe the Market looks like - on rates)   Realize with interest rates on debt increasing dramatically and likely to continue it is probably a very bad idea for Maker to take on long term debt in a fast moving and rising rate environment.  It is likely these loans won\u2019t be liquid if necessary to force them to close, and Maker will end up taking actual losses trying to recover principal much less principal + interest. Short Ratification Poll to Amend MIP64 to allow more flexibility in scope (MIP4c3-SP3) - April 18, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  - only reason I abstained here is that based on my reading while I understand the changes being made, it is entirely unclear how this will clarify the situation in the future. Whitelist Oasis.app on Multiple Oracles (MIP10c9-SP30) - April 18, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  - This seems reasonable and probably a better process should be involved.  I mean if Maker is going to whitelist to obtain revenues from others using our oracles this process seems reasonable.  But if doing this whitelisting has no other reasons then perhaps it is better if oracles just handles whitelisting internally vs. having the DAO approve of each whitelisting change.  Not entirely clear to me the implications of just removing whitelisting and perhaps adding a blacklist.

                    "content": "Delegate Communication 20220425_1123UTC  Update Change to vote on MIP62.  Supported Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP62) - April 11, 2022  - I still believe the 80K/yr for Accountable is an extremely high expense for payroll services.  I found three that could be utilized.   Claim by this CU is accountable is the \u2018only\u2019 solution out there it isn\u2019t.   This increase in budget could have been handled much differently by delaying the 8% increase in salaries 25K, and the 25K increase in the part time FTE and even a slight adjustment to accountable which could have been caught up during next budget raise.    This is what I mean by creative accounting to reduce expense increases.   IF this CU or other CUs keep coming back with > 15% budget increases expect that I will NOT be \u2018changing my no votes\u2019 on these in the future. Payroll services run no more than $100-200/FTE/month not $1600/month.  I am going to urge MakerDAO to consider spinning up their own payroll unit, issuing tokens MMPAY and start making money with a competing business unit to \u2018accountable\u2019 if this really is the only way to pay people in crypto. MIP62 likely would have failed if not for my promise to flip here with the condition this CU\u2019s on-going budget would not be increasing.   We will see if this CU lives up to their promise to me in exchange for my promise to them to change my vote and don\u2019t expect that I will be as likely to change these votes in the future as I don\u2019t think MKR holders are going to be happy to be flopping MKR below $1000 to pay for operations expenses in 12-18 months with these types of ongoing budget increases. I want to thank @Davidutro for reaching out and putting together two different budgets (one expansion and on on-going), At least one CU did what I asked and I felt it was important not to punish them when virtually every other \u2018expansion\u2019 budgets this run were passed by governance.  What this voting cycle showed is that MakerDAO governance is more willing to pay for \u2018parties\u2019 and massively expanded budgets PE, DIN, EVENTs than to approve the significant increase in the on-going GovComms budget which itself speaks volumes to me about the inconsistent state of MakerDAO governance generally. One other point.   This waiting till the end of polling period to at least put in an initial vote so interested parties I feel does a disservice to the DAO.  Sure we can and should discuss issues when these come up but when it comes to a vote, waiting till the last 24hrs precludes ANY lobbying or final discussion between interested parties and Maker Delegates.  I mean at least having delegates to discuss with is a step forward from unknown MKR voters that would vote last minute.   Time for delegates to step up their game by voting as soon as they can or at least posting how they intend to vote in their platforms giving interested parties time to lobby for good or for bad. ",

I happen to have many family connections into various parts of the Arabic world royal family and other.  The proposed DC is reasonable though we may not be able to come to terms on SF (which should be 5yr+100bps at least)\u2026   I think it would be nice to get some exposure to this part of the world with a \u2018kinda green\u2019 project. Community Greenlight Poll - IPCL (India Power Green Bonds) - May 2, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer)  My problem here is the time frame, the complexity of the structure and the fact it is massively priced below market.    I will add that India being regulatory and legislatively anti-crypto is a turn off.   I believe Maker would do well to add to the list of criterion a clause that the jurisdiction our money is going into has to be pro and not ANTI-crypto sending a strong message as we move on these to anti-crypto countries that YOU will not get any funding from MakerDAO if you are anti-crypto.    The prime reason is that these countries could pass another law forbidding any projects within the country to support DeFI which in effect would be like a blacklist forcing borrowers to give reason NOT to pay and basically making the collateral Maker has \u2018worthless\u2019 to us. Investigate Implementation of a TrueFi D3M - May 2, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight)  - I have some concerns here but support the idea of CES and other CUs spending the effort and taking a look. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - May 2, 2022 (thread)  - Voted: Yes  - I basically looks like rates are being normalized between wBTC and ETH but it has been my stance that rates don\u2019t appear to be the key driver.  Lowering certainly didn\u2019t increase demand.   In fact my biggest issue with OMC approach to markets is they haven\u2019t once done the opposite of what they think they should do with intention to reverse later to collect data on whether rate changes are even having any effect on our vaults (I honestly am becoming more skeptical that rate changes are dominating our vault borrows as the vast majority of DAI borrowed is by larger vaults and would like to the the OMC actually come up with a rate change approach that can give MakerDAO a real data signal.   Go down then up, whatever - anything that shows us a real signal)   Another point here is that if we can claim 50, 100 or even 200bps without too much change in vaults this revenue is important for Maker so we really need to get some real data, vs. just guessing and hoping.  Unless I am mistaken Maker is going to lose roughly 6M in revenue with the move on wBTC-A. What I find most interesting here is rates going down at Maker while rates in real world are up at some point money is going to find its way to higher rates and as many of us now have pointed out Maker with PEG at 1, no capital flow control, is stuck matching rates or facing the PSMs emptying and then MakerDAO is going to be left with DSR and/or increasing rates anyway.

Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold - May 16, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQgab4a - Abstained for the many reasons I have been vocal about for quite some time now.  [Signal Request] Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold - #14 by MakerMan  Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate Limited Flapper - May 16, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmREdTJK - Supported as I feel if Maker brings back the flapper (Personally I think taking DAI and putting up a Uniswap MKR/DAI v3 position would be a better use of flapping funds btw) the rate should be limited.  One thing I want to say about buying back MKR.   I really, REALLY would prefer Maker take some of the SB to build a SPF as this will give the DAO the ability to borrow against treasury assets and to earn return on those treasury assets.  What I personally have wanted to do is to have Maker build a treasury and to take 1/2 the treasury returns to consistently buy back MKR.  I also believe the entire community and DAO would be well served to start building a MKR-DAI Uniswap v2 LP position instead of burning MKR.  In effect MKR put into such a contract becomes \u2018inaccessible\u2019 because of the structure of the v2 LP.    But I don\u2019t believe MKR holders or the DAO will do anything along these lines due to the fractured and differing views.  Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWZvSpa - Supported.

Ratification Poll for MIP40 Budget Process Amendment (MIP4c2-SP19) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXVjbWG - Absolutely supported and as the idea originator and contributor feel this is a necessary step to getting some control to the out-of-control CU budget increases.  Please support this delegates.  Governance desperately needs some measure of budget controls that go beyond the binary yes/no Some comments on polls I have not decided yet but am formulating final opinions on.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis Clydesdale, Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution (MIP65) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXHM6us and  Ratification Poll for Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending (MIP68) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmS7UyQT I have multiple problems with Monetalis.  The rune association leads to distinct conflict of interest.  Rune may have pulled his investment but given he was an investor I still believe there are behind the scenes conflicts of interest that I would Maker rather avoid.   I have nothing against the team, I wish them success, and I appreciate their patience here but I don\u2019t believe it is in the best interests of Maker to take on this team. Personally I have read Monetalis post regarding how they would handle a increasing rate environment.   Put simply unless you are probably retired no-one in the current business has ever seen what happened during 1979-1981 and the recession after.   Put simply trying to buy bonds to get return in a rising rate environment is fraught with hazard that I think teams with even 25 years of experience have never seen.   I think everyone in this space is likely to get broadsided here with events people only have seen maybe once or twice in a very long lifetime. Maker PSMs have been draining as pressure comes on these markets.  LUNA/UST basically got buried.   Maker continues to ignore the reality that the PSM liquidity should have multiple brackets in price and hence fees on both sides.   Everyone continues to ignore my points on this matter and \u2018at some point\u2019 (This is not an IF folks but a when) the USDC and USP PSMs empty and the bottom drops out of the PEG, risk and the DAO will wake up to the fact that we blew a really good chance to make money with the PSM, but to structure it as a liquidity provider of last resort vs. first resort.   I am going to stop beating this dead horse because no-one to care, or people who have never seen really distressed markets don\u2019t seem to care.   Maker with this 0 fee PSM has basically killed the decentralized PEG managers (vault holders) and hazards that borrowers will have cash to put to work to repay loans should the PEG drop significantly off 1.  Given the whole stablecoin issues lately.   This could lead to significant hazard to DAI and to Maker should DAI fall off PEG significantly.  I have warned Maker and am warning DAI holders.   I am have done everything I could on my own.   The PSMs have emptied almost 3B since the peak the idea we\u2019d pull .5-1B here means the PEG is at higher risk sooner.   There is a problem that if Maker needs access to this USD liquidity as USDC we won\u2019t be able to get it back quickly or easily (and we might have losses as well). Main comment.  This team and this project has no experience (as a team as a on-going endeavor) so there is no historical performance context.  I would prefer we go with a manager that has at least 20-25 years of real experience.  My intention at least as of writing this is to vote against these for the reasons above.  Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQkxx16 I want to be clear.  I have never met A. Burban but have spoken with him quite a bit.  The guy is probably one of the most diehard Maker and longest term supporters I have ever known.  If there was a person who deserves this the most it is him.   My problem here is that there is no coherency between Events, SH, and any other PR.   I want to see all of this come under one coherent, well structured banner of Maker Public Relations with a reasonable budget.   Given Maker at this time lacks even a coherent vision I believe doing this piecemeal is problematic.   I had repeatedly urged A Burban to bring this budget under .5M and I might support it (even then I still have the same consistency problems).  He just seems unwilling to bring this budget into line here.  My intention is to vote no even though I would like to vote yes just to support A. Burban.  But when it comes to business while I feel personal relationships are important, I also believe being reasonable and responsible on budgets and demands brings a two-way street relationship.  My concern here is this relationship has been one way for too long, saying no here will burn the relationship with A. Burban, but saying yes basically is going to lead to a .77M budget with little direction and hardly any accountability growing to a 1M or 1.5M budget.   I really want this guy supported (and compensated for his past free work), but I want it to also be win-win for the DAO.

Please allow me to add a some colour for your consideration on your \u201cMain comment\u201d - i.e. the team and its ability to deliver results. I hope I can show you we have not taken the team-building for performance lightly, but taken quite considerate steps to ensure we have a performing team. Firstly I\u2019d like to differentiate between MIP65/Clydesdale and MIP68/Lusitano, because the skills required to do each well are a bit different, but overlap: MIP65 requires Monetalis to:  Setup an appropriate operational structure (legal, trustee, 3rd parties, reporting, monitoring, cashflow structure setup, etc) approved by LTS and acceptable to a top tier asset managers Execute a bond allocation strategy that is approved by SF with substantive Maker community input Allocated accordingly to a set of top tier professional asset managers for the actual investing and management. The asset managers, so far, we have convinced to design and consider potentially executing an investment strategy for Maker are Baillie-Gifford, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.  So certainly the actual asset managers doing the investing (and the proposals they make to Maker) should reasonably meet your requirement for a \u201cManager with 20 to 25 years real experience\u201d I\u2019d think. But does Monetalis have the skills to execute and operate this TradFi/Maker integration point? And help evolve it over time for Maker? And can we convince good asset managers to work with us/Maker? And do we know how to help Maker monitor investment performance and integration point? Well - personally I have setup many complex structures and got them to work as part of my private equity career - and I have worked with quite a few insurers on developing and operating appropriate asset allocation strategies. Other members of the team certainly also have complex structuring and operating experience from structured credit. So far, the asset managers we have found and got to collaborate seem appropriately top tier and engaging. And our collaboration with SFCU and LTS is well on-track. So all in all, I\u2019d venture we are well set for executing, succesfully, on MIP65. MIP68 contains a repeat of the TradFi/Maker integration point from above and so I won\u2019t go over again why I think we can execute that succesfully. But then, more importantly, MIP68 contains the building out of a non-bank wholesale funding business aligned with Maker\u2019s clean money vision. Now, the team we have collected to execute this business is, in my most humble opinion, excellent - and all with many years of proven performance and track record in this particular industry. I would be very happy to present the team in detail to you, but, If I understand you correctly, then your concern is not so much about the individual team members experiences/track record, but whether they will be able to perform as a team? And it is an excellent question! It was, in fact, one of the first I asked myself when building this team. Allow me to explain. Some years ago, after many years in private equity and investing, I decided to try and setup my own private equity firm - I found a team and started a search for institutional capital. And thats when I heard your question the first time - and it was repeated by every single institution we met in the capital search: how could they know these skilled and experienced individuals would be able to perform as a team? (this story btw has a happy ending as we did find some big financial institutions that believed the team would perform). In this process I found out that the most common investment team dysfunctions that institutions worry about are roughly the following:  PARALYSIS: team gets overwhelmed by finally being at the helm of a fund and so worried about becoming the best performer ever that they pass on all investments put in front of them as \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Money is not getting deployed. OVERENTHUSIAMS: the opposite of the paralysis situation. Team so hungry after investing that they just deploy quickly in a half-hazardous manner. Money getting deployed, but not well. Usually this type of team will under-manage their portfolio companies. HALF-BAKED: The team has not in advance reached a common set of values/ideas of what desirable deals look like and/or their individual roles and format of work. Creates infighting and lead to limited money deployed and often some very odd portfolios with varying degree of good management.  With this knowledge at the back of my mind I built the team out. For example: we have a youngster with only 15 years experience we really like on our team and with great credentials/track-record - I think he could potentially be \u201coverenthusiastic\u201d - so I put in a credit committee member I know he respects and I know won\u2019t be overenthusiastic at all - also I know they won\u2019t step on each others feet in terms who does what. And after building the team out we have been \u201crunning the team\u201d to ensure it operates as it should without any signs of deterioration or distortions to prevent anything half-baked. Basically you start building the pipeline and start running the credit facility approval processes to its natural ends (approved/not approved) on the pipeline. And then we do honest team reviews along the way. I can tell you, in this process, over the past almost 12 months, in fact, at least one senior person was removed and replaced due to these reviews. In addition we have also made a choice to run our business exactly as all other wholesale funder does it. This further decreases chances of being \u201chalf-baked\u201d - as everybody in the team then from the get-go knows core processes and roles etc. So all in all we feel quite good about this teams capacity for performance. It has been deliberate built for it - it is not just a random set of persons with strong track records put together. Perhaps a tell-tale sign to consider is that we have over the past month been able to build a fairly large pipeline, a good catalogue of partners and, in fact, a larger institutional capital partner willing to provide us substantive amounts of junior capital (USD 20M to start) and now also working with us on a program to acquire the senior debt portfolio we would build for Maker (to accelerate the capital cycle). These parties have all worked with the Lusitano team and been sufficiently impressed to decide to continue such work with the team. You might say you are only as good as the partners and customers you\u2019re able to attract. And I think the team has done terribly well in that respect. So, all in all, I believe, the team put together to execute MIP68 will perform. This was a lot longer than intended, but you had a very good question that deserved a full answer. I hope it can help you a bit in deciding how to cast your vote. Please do let me know if you have other concerns or questions. ",

                    "content": "@Allan_Pedersen I felt your well thought and kind response deserved an acknowledgement and comment.   I have always appreciated your well thought out and professional comments.  Your general patience and approach with Maker I have always felt was \u2018top notch\u2019 in terms of engagement and professionalism. If this was just an issue with a \u2018new team\u2019 and group it might be a more simple matter.   I have covered with my various posts my issues, but have not collected the sum total of issues.  But I can make a simple list.  Rune as prior investor and associated with Monetalis (historical conflicts of interest were disclosed but still weigh generally when it comes down to \u2018access\u2019 and \u2018prioritization\u2019.  While disclosed this didn\u2019t give a +1 to your case and isn\u2019t a 0 now but still a -1 to me. Concern that a new business will come up against financing or other issues.   This could be particular issue if we get into a high rate environment where loose money starts drying up. Structure of the \u2018deal\u2019 where Maker gets 1/2 the rate difference, might be attractive to another financier (it is just too easy to work the books so Maker doesn\u2019t get this bonus).  There was sufficient non-standard issues in the deal with Maker as to put the deal itself into a \u2018special category\u2019. While work is going on to get some equity backing it is just not clear to me this is sufficient. When considered against other possible deals (quality of the RWA managers) I just don\u2019t think Monetalis offers some significantly better deal, nor has significantly better terms, backing, etc.   In fact in almost every real metric I can come up with Monetalis is something that Maker should only do as a higher risk type of investment that should have significantly better terms for the higher risk Maker potentially is taking on. Monetalis wants to position itself as an Arranger so is looking to use Maker to build a portfolio.  Personally Monetalis looks to not be able to scale the way Maker would need because it is a newer player.    IMO Maker should focus first on moderate sized deals with very high quality players, that could ramp to substantial size easily (without delay or other issues) because they already have the historical relationships and capital to do so.  There is a general temptation on my part to want to do something with Monetalis, smaller in size (like 50M) but I consistently get the feeling Monetalis doesn\u2019t want to start small, and also that it simply is so raw/new that it will be too easy for Maker to be a dominant part of Monetalis.  I would prefer to start with 50-100M with a player that already has Billions in other deals going, that could ramp easily to 500-1000M and not have Maker be a substantial part of their portfolio.  I don\u2019t think this serves Monetalis, or Maker. Monetalis is just too new, and playing in an environment that is very competitive and I am not convinced Monetalis is going to be able to bring the best deals to Maker, nor be responsive to changes in capital allocation (like if for some reason Maker wanted to move on a larger deal). As a small part of our portfolio ( say 50M) I am ok with it.  At 200M or more out of the gate give or take I just am not as comfortable as I would be with SocGen, Huntingdon, etc\u2026 I can\u2019t emphasize enough Allan this is nothing personal against Monetalis, absolutely nothing against you or your team, but simply a view from my seat that Maker probably would do well to start doing deals with the most qualified, experienced, players in the space vs. taking on a new player.  I feel like Maker should have an equity position to do this but then if we take that on, we have conflicts of interest\u2026 Fortunately my position only is backed by so much MKR and so my vote alone won\u2019t likely push this one way or another.  I just can\u2019t in good conscience for MKR holders vote in the affirmative on either MIP65 or MIP68 and this is mostly due to my impressions regarding Monetalis and overall terms of the deals.   When I toss in the close rune affiliation I believe it is better to let Monetalis prove itself within the traditional space and to revisit any deals with your team after some time has elapsed. ",

On top of the issues already listed when I look at the quality of applications with my limited view I think Maker can and should do better than a new, unknown player in the RWA space.  Perhaps over a year ago Maker without too many potentials could and would have taken on Monetalis, at this point I think we have better choices.   I would be irresponsible to various Maker stakeholders to choose a sub-par RWA originator here.   @Allan_Pedersen I just can\u2019t support Monetalis \u2018at this point\u2019.   please do go and get some business going and I will be more than happy after your team has built books and executed to review a resubmission (should you and your team wish to go through this again).   I just want to see your team build its own portfolio in the space independent of Maker before I consider approving Monetalis with Maker.   I really like you and your team.  I can\u2019t stress enough the \u2018top notch\u2019 professionalism, patience and attention to details you have shown Maker/MakerDAO.   Fortunately or Unfortunately other players that I feel would be better suited are in the queue here and I really want to focus on getting some deals done now, so when/if Monetalis comes back,  Maker/MakerDAO can welcome Monetalis into the Maker fold.  Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) - May 9, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQkxx16 As per above.  I finally put in my NO vote here.   Given the further drop in revenues and likelighood (according to my own internal projections) of Maker going revenue neutral to negative by August I believe it is even more important to get expenditures under control.   I support Burban, I just believe SH, Events, and branding, whatever else needs to come under it\u2019s own CU with distinct goals and measurement metrics as well as driving vision (I don\u2019t think Maker even has a clear vision at this point).   The above is a continuation stand regarding expanding budgets with no end in sight and not a swipe at SH or Burban.   30-35K/month ends up being that .5M/yr and that is really where I wanted this to land before even thinking about supporting it.  Community Greenlight Poll - FEI (Fei USD) - May 16, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmbzebcq - Voting no on this.   I read up a bit.  Saw @SebVentures was the one who posted the MIP6.   Seriously folks Maker has a lot of work in the queue already for the next 3-6 months.   Can we only bring forward very important requests because even if this passed nothing would happen on it for many months.   I really have issues with anything connected to Olympus, and I am just not convinced if we have oracles on FEI (which we should on all the stables btrw) we will make our money back.    There is this desperation to get DAI out there, can CUs please focus on the best and biggest projects here vs. just grabbing at everything and anything?    It takes a lot of time to bring these forward and review these.   I want to focus on proposals that have revenue generation potentials > 1M/yr and ideally more like >5M/yr AND significant DAI growth.

                    "content": "Dear @MakerMan I appreciate the acknowledgement and candour. I particularly appreciate you setting out your thoughts and concerns so clearly. Allow me a few thoughts on them for your consideration. I here follow your numbering   As you mention, Rune is no longer an investor. His shares are put to the benefit of Maker - all proceeds accruing to his shares would go to the Surplus Buffer.  However, it is a plain fact that Rune and I remain largely aligned on thinking about Maker & RWA - after all - we spent some time discussing this. MIP65/68 are largely specific expressions of some of these thoughts over time. Any support in the forum from Rune - in the past or now - are merely consequence of alignment of thought and strategy and nothing else. I am rock solid confident Rune\u2019s alignment in all actions remains solely with Maker.  It is a reasonably tough pill to swallow, when being somewhat aligned in thinking with Rune gives you a \u201c-1\u201d straight out of the gate. But fair enough.   I worry that you may be thinking about us a bit like a new tech startup. We are not quite that. We are a professional, experienced, investment team and have plentiful access to patient, cross-cyclical private investors from the investment/asset management world.  However, and in fact much more important in my view, MIP65 and 68 are designed, as all credit engagement should be: they are designed to be immune to manager failure. I.e. If Monetalis keels over, the Maker trusts remain intact and, for MIP65, any purchased bonds under MIP65 remain the ownership of the trust and can be disposed of as is seen fit by the community. For MIP68, any wholesale funding extended, remains in the ownership and control of the Maker trust - and automatically a pre-agreed backup manager is appointed (that has been shadowing the business since inception so they hit the ground running) and Maker can choose to run it off or potentially appoint another Manager to run it. This \u201cemergency\u201d process is then further smoothed out by the Delegated Maker Committee structure that we and LTS/RWF have been contemplating and designing over the past months.  Basically, in my view, all credit arrangements Maker sets up should always be designed to perform irrespective of manager health. Without having checked it, I am certain that current arrangements are in place, such that, for example should 6S or Centrifuge expire, all credit extended continues to perform to spec.   I wonder if there are some misunderstandings here. To be clear on the compensation structures in the MIPS:   MIP65:\t0.15% of AuM fixed fee to Monetalis p.a\u2026 I.e. 500M x 0.15% = 750K MIP68: \t1% AuM fixed fee p.a. + 20% of profit after 2% to Maker. I.e. for example: 50M @ 6% portfolio return means Fee: 50M x 1% = 500K Profit share: 50M x (6% -1% - 2%) x 20% = 300K  I am hard pressed to see how these are particularly unfair or non-standard.    If I understand this point correctly, then I think my thoughts on 2. address this. Forgive me if I misunderstood.   I, of course, have considered how we compare to other deals on the forum - current or prospective. At the current moment, I would venture that both MIP65 & 68 should score quite well on risk, return, strategy and market conditions etc.  MIP65: We set up a safe structure w/LTS approval, ensuring money is allocated to top tier asset managers on good negotiated terms w/SF approval. The community is involved in the selection of asset managers and bond strategy to execute/mandate. I honestly see very little risk here. Not sure how this can be accomplished faster/cheaper/better - particularly given how far along we are with this project\u2026 MIP68: I have written so many details about this project over the past 8 months in the forum, that I really can\u2019t add more to it. I know you have looked at the \u201clines of defence\u201d note and it didn\u2019t seem to carry the day, but I assure you it is quite a high bar we set there - not many will be able to reach it. You can try yourself and measure other deals against it should you find it interesting - you may be surprised by the results. Perhaps one note on the Manager vs Team: performance follows Team, not Manager - it is just a fact of the investment industry. We have a very good team - it will perform as any high-quality manager with a good team - and outperform one that might for a time be saddled with a mediocre one (which isn\u2019t an unusual situation as a manager go through teams - the high performing teams have a financial incentive to go out on their own).   I think you have two point in here, let me take them one at a time: a/ \u201cNew = Not scale fast enough\u201d: I don\u2019t think I can reasonably agree on this. MIP65 is infinitely scalable from day-one of operations. You can go from buying 500M worth of bonds/mandates to 10B+ within a day. It is specifically designed as such. That is somewhat the whole point of the exercise of putting down the appropriate infrastructure for doing so safely via MIP65.  MIP68 is deliberately set in a segment that allows small, high-quality investment teams to develop large manageable, high-quality portfolios at pace. We have presented a pipeline of many 100M\u2019s in detail. We have conducted due diligence on many to have the portfolios ready to go. We can scale quite rapidly - and continue to grow into the billions staying in this segment over the years.  b/  \u201cBetter Strategy = start medium sized w/High-quality managers and ramp up because they have capital and relationships to do so\u201d. Let me address this a bit later in this post.   In the section below your list, you make a number of good statements well worthy of commentary/clarification. I will use a quote and response format here for simplicity: \u201cThere is a general temptation on my part to want to do something with Monetalis, smaller in size (like 50M) but I consistently get the feeling Monetalis doesn\u2019t want to start small,\u201d : MIP68 is exactly 50M with a possibility of moving to 100M. We listened to the community and did start small as requested. MIP65 is 500M - but that is a bond purchase execution program - rather different. \u201cand also that it simply is so raw/new that it will be too easy for Maker to be a dominant part of Monetalis.\u201d: I am hard pressed to see evidence anywhere of single source capital players in our industry under-performing. Rather I have seen some logic and argument that single source capital allows for further control, alignment and focus - note the terms of the bond acquired by the trust - the control points and involvement is above market standard to provide Maker with a better structure. I am guessing we are here talking about MIP68 rather than MIP65, because surely it doesn\u2019t matter how many partake in the bond execution program - should have no impact on results whatsoever\u2026 \u201cI would prefer to start with 50-100M with a player that already has Billions in other deals going, that could ramp easily to 500-1000M and not have Maker be a substantial part of their portfolio\u201d: I just don\u2019t clearly see much evidence of why this is a better strategy - quite the opposite. Firstly, I find it a risky strategy to work only with regulatory sensitive players where Maker is but a drop in the bucket. They can say goodbye any day of the week as regulators move in on stable coins. Secondly, the TradFi/Defi integration point is very young work in progress - very important to work with parties that are willing to deliberate work on improving this point and aligned to not take advantage of any loop holes. Thirdly, performance remains embedded with investment teams rather than managers - including access to unique portfolios - no particular protection in a Manager without the right team. Fourth, the ability to ramp up is not necessarily driven by size of the Manager, it is often, in segments more so driven by the investment team, the structure of the segment and the team\u2019s access. Fifth, all the issues of working with Maker and processes around it and the need for having a \u201cbuffer\u201d element between TradFi and DeFi (such as we are doing in MIP65 and MIP68). I think we stop there - we can have a very long conversation on this point if you would like at some stage. I dont think there is a right or wrong answer on this btw - merely an evolving strategy that will only become clear in action (\u201ceverybody has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d). \u201cMonetalis is just too new,\u201d: MIP65: I see no evidence that this would be better/cheaper/faster accomplished by say a \u201cfund-of-fund\u201d - the hard part is the TradFi/DeFi integration point, which in fairness is not something many have experience in. And we have gotten quite far in getting this project done. In this we cannot reasonably be characterised as \u201cnew\u201d I think. MIP68: We deliberately chose a segment to enter where it is common that senior teams move out and build their own portfolios with no loss of performance - such that the consequence of being \u201cnew\u201d is of no performance consequence. \u201cand playing in an environment that is very competitive\u201d: MIP65: Not sure how \u201cthe execution of bond investment mandates\u201d can be seen as very competitive? I don\u2019t really think it is. MIP68: A rather vast, and definitely unproductive, oversimplification of the market dynamics. Many factors play in your competitiveness in this market: long-term relationships with lenders, lenders need for diversification of funding sources, the current pull-back by banks from the market, credit class focus, your speed of execution, consistency in deployment etc - we are competitive today, as proven by the pipeline size and characteristics. \u201cand I am not convinced Monetalis is going to be able to bring the best deals to Maker,\u201d: MIP65: We would not propose the best bond strategies from the best asset managers? I think this is not quite a fair assessment of the status quo on this. MIP68: We have a large pipeline. They are all being negotiated to industry standard spec. We will scale and perform exactly as any high-quality wholesale senior secured funder in the UK. For someone being active in this segment that is exactly what one can hope for as bringing \u201cthe best deals\u201d on to Maker. There is absolutely no sign anywhere that we would be bringing a subpar performing portfolio to Maker. \u201cnor be responsive to changes in capital allocation (like if for some reason Maker wanted to move on a larger deal)\u201d: MIP65: We can liquidate mandates within a day with the bond managers and bond strategies that are being considered. And we can move into new mandates the next day. That is about as fast as you can ever want to make changes in capital allocation I\u2019d think. MIP68: This is a senior secured wholesale lender funding in the UK business. If we had the vault size and Maker wanted to provide a specific senior/super senior secured facility to a large Bank or Credit fund in the UK or EU, we would have the infrastructure to execute this - and very likely manage it. \u201cAs a small part of our portfolio ( say 50M) I am ok with it.\u201c MIP68: It truly is 50M with a possibility of extension to 100M we are requesting. At 200M or more out of the gate give or take I just am not as comfortable as I would be with SocGen, Huntingdon, etc\u2026 MIP65: I am merely executing and focusing on the TradFi/DeFi integration point and engaging asset managers - the actual investing/asset management is to be done by top tier asset managers. I think those I have proposed so far: Baillie-Gifford, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, should amply satisfy your requirements for quality investors for a 500M portfolio. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough Allan this is nothing personal against Monetalis, absolutely nothing against you or your team,\u201d I am definitely not taking it personally. I very much appreciate you writing this and being specific. Only way we can get to the bottom of confusion and have factual, evidence-based, first principle discussions. Apologies for now again providing a long answer, but you covered quite a lot that deserved some more detailed comments and clarifications. It seems to me, that there is some \u201cgap\u201d between your reading of what we are proposing in MIP65 and MIP68, and what we believe we are proposing in them? I do sincerely hope we decreased this \u201cgap\u201d a bit with the above clarifications and comments. And produced some extra food for thought. We remain available for further questions, of course, over Sunday and Monday. We absolutely aspire to make it possible for you to vote on as full and complete an information-base as possible. Again, thank you for your very specific and direct comments. I think that is very productive! ",

                    "content": "Delegate Communication 20220527_1424UTC  Investigate Implementation of an Antalpha Institutional Vault - May 23, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmNpELvR - Supported.  Proposal was unclear on the rate, once this was straightened out easy to support.  I will point out as Maker users become predominantly institutions this means as these IV players \u2018rebalance\u2019 expect Maker revenues to bounce around quite a bit.    Maker borrowing is growing significantly more centralized with less players minting the lions share of DAI.  Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH - May 23, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQRhmQa - Supported. I agree with concerns that Maker already is in effect long ETH/wBTC via vaults and putting treasury to work in ETH may have hazards.  But this is a poll to \u2018investigate\u2019 not to deploy.  I have suggested the best way to earn return is via ETH-USDC v2 LP (though one could also do a v3 or some combination).   Point here is that given Maker has oracle gas costs in ETH it would behoove the DAO to actually have investments in ETH.  The v2 LP reduces investment volatility to sqrt(ETH) is 100% liquid and earns currently > 10%.   Bonus here is the DAO actually can borrow DAI against the position which is also useful.    While I have suggestions for what to invest in, I believe it makes sense to at least investigate the risk/reward to the DAO.   I have long been a supporter in Maker building a treasury of assets it can also borrow against using our very same protocol as this gives the DAO a direct way to sop up or let loose some DAI liquidity if needed.  Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmahjYA2 - Supported.  I still wonder why in the heck this is being limited to 1basis vs 1.1 or .9 etc.   I hear @PaperImperium comments about friction with interest but I believe that it makes sense to be able to implement fees, and to have some out of the gate vs. just providing a free service that costs Maker to maintain.  Fees can go to zero later if this has some measurable benefit.  I have also advocated fees on the PSMs as well as bracketed liquidity.   People seem to believe that somehow fees will make people not use something.   I suggest if you don\u2019t have competitive alternatives you will, also that any ETH transaction always has network access fees.   Ask yourself if competitors are going to do this feeless, why Maker should even enter the bridging services as it will cost us money in TechOps to monitor, and money in Protocol Engineering to maintain/upgrade.  Community Greenlight Poll - FEI (Fei USD) - May 16, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmbzebcq - Voted NO.   This vault is only going to be used by the protocol and I honestly don\u2019t think it will earn Maker enough to cover maintenance costs, oracles, etc.   There is a lot on engineering plate to boot so I think even if it passes will be buried in the large heap of work remaining to be done.  Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold, MKR Vesting, Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate-limited Flapper - May 25, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-raise-the-esm-minimum-threshold-mkr-vesting-adjust-the-lid-parameter-on-the-rate-limited-flapper-may-25-2022 - Already been vocal in my comments here.  Considered just not voting on this proposal but imo better if Maker effectively can\u2019t be shutdown.   I am pretty sure that if there is a problem it is going to take a significant amount of time to bring 150K MKR to bear in the ES if it is needed.  Likely governance will act faster than the ES. ",

This LP on Uniswap has 1/10the liquidity of ETH-USDC and gets 1/20th the volume.  Maker could have done some moderate incentives via MKR-R or MKR3 rewards to see if we could have kept this vault around.  It is just really sad that DAI couldn\u2019t find traction with users via ETH-DAI v2 LP and that is why I couldn\u2019t vote YES on this one.   It shows how Maker has completely ignored one of my main ideas - incentivize Uniswap v2 Token-DAI LP (via DeepLiquidity thesis brought up and discussed in many places) even with moderate 1-2% sustainable farming rewards.

Add rETH as a new Vault Type - June 13, 2022 - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfMswF2 - Supported  I struggled with this a bit because the Market cap seemed low, but when I looked at the thread I saw a couple reports of MC and it looked to be growing pretty dramatically.  I also had some concerns about loading up more work for CUs when Maker is pretty saturated work wise.  I stand by idea that CUs can just wade through the work as they see fit and trust they will coordinate on priorities.  I think in the end we want to bring rETH on, but I have concerns that we will lose money for a while on oracle costs.   In the final analysis it makes sense to queue rETH up and see what CUs have to say.  Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT - June 13, 2022 - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQD5mao - Supported  I had a number of issues here.  My biggest one is that I don\u2019t see most of these LP rewards models as sustainable, not entirely clear here how/why velodrome is somehow better than Uniswap, Balancer, or any number of other potential places to provide LP.   I am ok with OP/DAI but always have to wonder about why stables need incentives (when the incentive value could never be recovered by fees).   Just not sustainable.   In the end I didn\u2019t see a reason to vote against I just don\u2019t see how these really high APRs are long term sustainable.  Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWCy8Bc - Supported  At first I thought this was a general action in that MKR wouldn\u2019t just be burned.   But when I looked at the price of MKR the market cap and surplus and the rate proposed (33K/day) it made more sense to actually test such a system before we consider whether to burn (or burn 1/2 or 1/3 say) and use 1/3 to build LP (MKR-DAI v3) and/or to save the MKR for dssvest.  At some point the DAO is going to have to start buying MKR to cover MKR vesting and at $750, the 4K MKR vesting/year is roughly $3M.  In my mind it made sense to spend $3M now to buy a years worth of MKR vesting (seems cheap compared to looking at a 12-16M vesting bill when MKR was 3-4K a few months ago).   General note on my view on burn.  I have been against this for a while as I believe Maker would do far better building LP (v3 0-infinity + other approaches) than to just burn MKR but I keep coming back to idea that having \u2018some burn\u2019 even if small on a consistent basis (unless there is some financial emergency) is important for a large amount of people and so I am changing my view to having some burn even if it is 100K/month\u2026  Community Greenlight Poll - KREDIKA (Kredika LTD) - June 6, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWTfWad - Not supported I think there is enough on Maker CU plates at the moment.

Community Greenlight Poll - XSGD (StraitsX) - June 6, 2022 - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmd4RbRq - Not Supported  Again already enough on Maker CU plates here.  Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmbs5Kx5 Not Supported I could spend a lot of time explaining all the reasons.  Plain and simple here is I expect this kind of work to happen under the associated CUs and is within their mandates and existing budgets.  I don\u2019t think a clear case has been made illustrating the issues and why this particular proposal solves them.   I would have rather had a discussion of the problem so the entire DAO could suggest and get behind a solution.  This is another example of CUs stepping beyond their mandated actions, trying to get more money and authority to do whatever they want, whenever they want, with some slush fund.  Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) - June 13, 2022 https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXbgVGz - Supported Generally I am going to be supportive of keeper initiatives if the costs to the DAO are reasonably low.

Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001 - @psychonaut (MIP41c4-SP34) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: @psychonaut has been nothing but courteous and respectful as well as helpful to me.  As one who has a lot of experience managing and working with others I tend to place high value on others who I respect.  A number of these people I do respect have unfortunately been pretty vocal against psychonaut.  In this case I am voting to abstain vs. coming down for or against.  I simply don\u2019t have enough information to make a decision and wonder if a facilitator is even needed to manage Immunefi. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to DIN-001 - @tadeo (MIP41c4-SP35) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Looks like DIN isn\u2019t going to move along the path I suggested (to take a part of the DIN funds and develop general purpose Data dashboards all DAOs might need and try to develop an income strategy by also being a general DAO data insights service for DAOs along with providing specific Data to Maker.  I also would like to see other CUs that use DIN actually have a line item for DIN services so the DAO can begin to see who is using DIN for what and how much this is costing. Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Personally I believe any oversight could be done better by SF and would rather see SF budget increased to include a general RWA oversight/analytical subgroup. Ultimately I am sensitive to comments that any single CU could act as gatekeeper vs. just performing analytical functions.  I am not even sure how to implement oversight in a way that firewalls in such a way that interests of such a unit at all times and under all circumstances are aligned with MKR holders. Ratification Poll for Task Forces (MIP75) - June 13, 2022. (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Not hot to give a blank check here for increased autonomy and discretion via funds.  While this had a RFC period I don\u2019t think sufficient discussion pro/con was generated and this appears to be the case when the vote is considered.  I believe what this group wants to do is within their own CU roles and responsibilities (particularly Growth btw) and sufficient justification has not been given for me to support the need and the method here. Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I supported this because I have for a long time pushed for Maker to build a secondary reserve - start somewhere somehow because Maker doesn\u2019t just need to generate income from assets but needs to diversify the collateral portfolio.  My goal with this was to start earning some stable return so Maker could use the profits from investments to pay for a sustainable burn.  I also believe Maker is losing opportunity by not building MKR-DAI LP (v3, etc).  Investing in ETH (our gas for operations) so we can also use our own collateral to borrow DAI and earn return is a lost opportunity. ETH-USDC v2 has been consistently earning over 1000bps for the past 16-24 months.  I hope the DAO someday decides to move in this direction.  I understand there are numerous hazards in such an endeavor.  Expect more on this in my Maker3.0 presentation in the coming weeks. Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This just generally makes sense and formalized the changes already made. Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: 3M to potentially buy 4K or more MKR which covers MKR vesting for all CUs for 1 year seems like a deal honestly.  Sure it burns 3M DAI but in the grand scheme of Maker finances this wouldn\u2019t be a mistake.  I would have been more for putting up a v3 with say 4K MKR and 3M DAI spanning a range from 400 to 2K since worst case is we set a floor price with 3M liquidity between 400-700, and sell 4K MKR between 700 and 2000 which should net us about 50-60M DAI which could then be added to the surplus.  In effect this becomes a fund raising operations on the upside, and a buy 3M worth of MKR on the downside.   This was not specified in this MIP though.  Even so I support the idea here and with MKR at 750/MKR is probably one of the best times to buy MKR. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve increased budget 2nd choice: Approve existing budget only (business as usual) Reasoning: I actually read over both budgets and on first glance was like - why does this group need more funding (32% vs what 43%).  SF and GovAlpha are two of my highest rated CUs when I was working on my own CU grading report (almost completed).  I have been impressed not just with the quality of the work, but the scope/reach.  I am impressed with what this group has accomplished and when I compare their budget and accomplishments with something like growth below I think the modest 300K increase from about 800K for what they are doing actually is \u2018cheap\u2019 relative to the value they perform. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget 2nd choice: Approve existing budget only (BrandlessGrowth) Reasoning: Honestly when I graded the CUs (coming soon) growth didn\u2019t rank highly.  They may do a lot behind the scenes but honestly when I look at their budget, what they have accomplished and how many times they have tried to offload what I see as their own mandate (Events, SH, Branding, etc.) and have basically asked for significantly more resources I think the money could be better used elsewhere.  Over the past 6-12 months I honestly have not really seen significant growth beyond adding wBTC (and this was pushed my many people including myself).  I don\u2019t see any real new growth initiatives that focus on DAI use, LPs, etc. and feel like most of the growth initiatives are coming from PE or CES.  Perhaps growth doesn\u2019t communicate very well, or I am missing something but this is my honest personal subjective view here.   While working on aspects of what is now my Maker3.0 proposal spke with Growth initially they were excited to have someone working on a new growth proposal but when I had something done and was seeking input I hear nothing from growth, dead silence.  If I had a choice to lower growth budget 5-10% I would have chosen those over out rejection. ",

We have been working actively on improving transparency on what we do, posting updates on the forum and using our Twitter account to talk about it. You can read a summary of GrowthCU\u2019s accomplishments during the last year and the usage of our budget in this link. I\u2019m happy with all growth we have pushed into the protocol, of course, it is not a GrowthCU only achievement, as everything in the DAO is thanks to work between various teams (community, delegates, CUs, MKR holders). As you said, onboarding wbtc was a great decision pushed by different people from the community and implemented by PECU. As with any collateral, our job is to find users for that ilk, educate the ecosystem about it, and use our force to spread the word (through partnerships, pr, social media, events\u2026). Last year we saw a rise in its usage coming from Nexo and Celcius (  ). We have been talking with bitcoin miners (check ant alpha IV proposal) and institutions with large crypto treasuries about Maker Vaults, of course, the market impacts everything. Still, we are in an interesting position as a lending protocol, so we need to convert that into a narrative and showcase it everywhere. With the Makerv3.0 proposal, I agree with you about increasing liquidity because that will help our growth. LPs are outside our mandate, but we can bring partners to the protocol to offer these solutions with their unique implementations (wintermute, truefi, maple, karpatkey) And regarding events+SH+brand, we hear you, but we started with brand, as we think it\u2019s an essential piece for the GrowthCU mandate. We support ecosystem events, but we don\u2019t organize parties: that\u2019s why we sponsor HackMoney2022 to find teams to build on top of Maker, we try to get a speaker slot on the main events, and have been organizing small-size dinners/lunches during the main conferences with our partners. Thanks again for your feedback, I hope we can talk soon to try to find a way to improve how we communicate what we do! ",

I was tempted to add Reject as my second choice but when I considered my real stance here I wanted a choice to lower the Growth budget slightly.   My reasoning is both due to dropping revenues, and to the fact crypto decidedly isn\u2019t in a growth phase.   Seriously where other than already decided initiatives is Maker going to find significant growth in collateral assets leading to DAI that would justify such initiatives.  Branding, Events, etc. really going to lead to growth?   Now something never mentioned and @aburban90 pointed out to me what that Maker through swag, and or events has actually gotten staff.   I won\u2019t name names because I think it would be good if people working for Maker could actually comment themselves on whether it was reach out initiatives like SH and Events that actually introduced and brought them to MakerDAO.    So in some way I think initiatives like this are important, but they should be measured balanced and well coordinated with some sort of tracking/rewards to measure effectiveness both in a hiring of talent sense, and a brought business to Maker sense (or even if Maker gets positive articles/press).   To my mind MakerDAO is adequately staffed for growth for the short term (6-12 months) and where I see actual tangible growth is already being worked on (D3M, wormhole, RWA).    The whole additional work on the \u2018aggressive growth proposal\u2019 seems ill thought out and doesn\u2019t take into consideration the current environment in DeFI.     MakerMan:  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 (thread)   Changed vote here to a single choice:  Approve existing budget only (business as usual).  In many ways I appreciate what SF is doing both in terms of looking at budgets and looking at Maker from strategic point of view.   Various initiatives I have been a promoter of for a long time.   While I think Maker has enough money to grow various units given the state of the markets, the general uncertainty in budget accounting, and projections it makes more sense to look to normalize on-going budgets vs. adding more headcount until Maker has a better handle on exactly where finances are going.  I also am back to all budget \u2018growth\u2019 initiatives coming into a quarterly outlook cadence vs. every CU asking for more and tossing their requests at governance.  Put simply I want to see a better methodology for managing a global budget, how to claw back funds into a staff only surplus buffer (as independent from CU wallets and SB).  How to track budgets better.  How to give governance a choice and reasonable methodology to signal the desire to decrease a budget vs. eliminate it entirely (choice between - approve existing and rejecting simply put is not good enough for budget management because it does not allow for any reasonable budget reduction choices 5-10% say).   Because of all these factors while I might want to increase SF so we can get more eyes on budget issues, my concern is that SF is reaching pretty far with scope here and if the budget is increased might simply cause scope creep.  I really want this unit to nail down budget and finance reporting and governance itself to seriously consider addressing how the DAO in a fully decentralized fashion (no multisigs and software only controlled by governance) be able to build and manage a treasury, LP, etc.  See comments below.     MakerMan:  Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 (thread)   and     MakerMan:  Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 (thread)   Changing votes here from Yes to NO: I want to thank fellow delegate @ChrisBlec for helping me clear through the muck in my own thinking.  I have been wanting MakerDAO for a long time to start building some secondary reserves both to earn some return, but also as a collateral/funding buffer to cover CU operations (to have a formal cash run in a place independent of the Surplus Buffer) that also allowed for some DAI liquidity management (via being able to use the collateral in Maker vaults to add or remove DAI liquidity via some sort of governance controlled open market operations).  The problem here is that in my zest to get something, anything going in this regard I disregarded what I consider key features of such operations.  Decentralization, security, and transparency.   The point here is that IF MakerDAO starts doing investments via multisig actions with limited actors deciding this in effect centralizes features of the protocol potentially bringing Maker under regulatory scrutiny and legislative action, additionally there are fund security concerns with multisigs generally.  This is particularly true of the Makershire SPV.  With respect to the Open Market Operations to buy and burn MKR.   I believe the DAO should have a real discussion of not just the conditions and amounts on funding burn, but the time frames and methods of execution.  Dsskiln acting in an automated fashion is useful but I believe we should revisit the methodology of how Dsskiln acts.   I would like governance to have conditions to start to operate, limit the amount and rate of DAI to be used, and to be able to construct a queue of items to examine when making a decision of where to put DAI.  In the end I want governance to have control over both the list of things to invest in, the amount of DAI to transact, the frequency of action, and conditions of actions.   Once these variables are set this Treasury function should be able to run independently of governance with the exception of how and when DAI funds are added or removed.   Because I believe I have acted with haste to get anything done on starting up MKR burn, and to create a secondary surplus buffer or treasury without considering the ramifications to Maker I am changing my vote to NO on these with the hope that the DAO will have a longer and better discussion of how to achieve the goals of both of these initiatives in ways that maintain, security, decentralization, transparency, using somewhat automated methodologies (i.e. smart contracts/software directed by governance).

Issue here is that without long term vision and strategy profitability can\u2019t be decided.  EVERYONE will always want to be profitable.   The problem here is that while I was the first one long ago to signal to the DAO to pay attention to budgets and CU growth, I am going to be the first one here suggesting NOT to go overboard on cutting budgets to become \u2018profitable\u2019.   Given the strongly cyclical nature of crypto and Maker\u2019s dependence on SC for revenues, not RWA it is likely at least for the next 6-12 months Maker may have to run at a deficit.   My rough numbers here is that expenses (without new CUs or expanded budgets) is running 30-35M/yr, revenues still falling at 15-20M,  CU excess DAI is 15M, SB 80M.   If I set next 12 month expenses to NOT exceed 40M, and revenues to be 10M, this leaves a surplus deficit of 30M.   Given CUs have 15M excess this \u2018should\u2019 mean no more than 15M extra expenses which means the surplus buffer drops to 65M MARK the above because I suspect it will be closer to reality in 12 months than anything else What this means is that by this time next year Maker should have > 65M in the surplus.  I consider that anything below 50M in the surplus poses increasing risk to the protocol but this number is arbitrary.  Certainly most people would agree that 10-25M Surplus with 1B in crypto assets, even 100-500M RWA has higher risk to the protocol.   Having closer to 100M surplus would be better. Ignored in above analysis is any liquidations, and huge expenses not accounted for and has at least 5-10M excess spend head room just for contingencies. All in all Maker should be proud to have gone from 100M in DAI to 10B DAI in 2 years.  crypto assets paying 18M in fees is a significant achievement.   This idea that Maker is financially strapped, and needs to cut expenses dramatically is coming from people who either don\u2019t understand cyclicality, or would rather put profits, over people and continuous business operations.   Where Maker is now IS PRECISELY why I put my budget foot down so strongly now at least 3-6 months ago.  I think Maker can do better on how we manage budgets, and I also think working at Maker in a CU given this whole budget governance knee jerking environment would make me personally start looking for a different job (as a backup at least). This particular poll doesn\u2019t take into account the kinds of scenarios I could envision and is looks FAR too ahead into the future (3 year run, honestly crypto barely can look past the end of the year).

Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qma3P8v9) - Abstain.  My first thought was to reject this to force this group to come back with a 12 month budget without the exemption.  I am convinced if the budget with exemption passes it will set a precedent and governance can expect to see more of these \u2018exemptions\u2019 emerge in future budget requests.   On the other hand, perhaps it is a win for contractors, at expense of ability of governance to restrain budgets.  In the long run the choice between the different accept budget  proposals here irrelevant when put in the context of a reject which doesn\u2019t look likely to happen even if I voted for it.  Time for someone else to figure out a palatable approach to budget control/management as my views to tap the breaks when things were good, to accelerate a bit when times are bad vs. this overboard reaction (cut budgets, end CUs, fire people hard when times are difficult, and try to grow like crazy and hire everyone, throw money at everything when times are good) more balanced budget approach has been consistently contested.

While a sponsor of the original there has been a lot of controversy around the DAO doing any kind of secondary surplus, treasury, or for the DAO to own/manage collateral assets (earning or not).   I will say MakerDAO has consistently done worse that a lot of much better DAOs when it comes to \u2018treasury\u2019 or \u2018surplus\u2019 management as witnessed by floppy friday, and many of these votes.   Perhaps in time when METADAOs come on line Maker and all the DAOs will finally end up with good treasuries and management of DAO assets to maximize performance.  Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmTNaLnY) - I honestly am against EVENTs as its own CU\u2026  Saw this as a part of a larger marketing department I felt should be handled directly under growth.  governance chose to on-board this.   I want to say as perhaps my last poll as a delegate that it should be a minimum requirement for new contractors to the DAO to have an initial 12-month funding commitment that goes along with clearly written and measurable performance goals to be met in the period as a show of good faith by MakerDAO to new contractors.  This idea of on boarding one month and 3-6 months later off boarding without a formal list of \u2018shall nots\u2019 that would be \u2018cause\u2019 to initiate off-boarding (at ANY TIME) is abhorrent to me and will not be a plus when trying to recruit and engage new contractors.   Abstaining atm as this could go either way and I would be ok with either result at this point.  Comments A few general comments as to state of MakerDAO:  It was nice to see @Juan and SES come forward with some kind of alternative for DAO work via project management (will add link later). Implications of US sanctions on Tornado Cash I think are significant in the space.   I personally believe building a anti-fragile, decentralized, financial system using blockchain when considered in the context of TradFi from US regulatory perspective appears impossible.   Likely this is going to fragment blockchains and crypto generally into \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 which really is an unfortunate turn of events.  It is my hope that legislators will bring forward workable crypto legislation that will create practically realizable standards.  In the absence of that US citizens will be further marginalized and much of the world will begin moving away from the US Dollar - for good reason. Regarding the state of MakerDAO and governance/RWF in particular.  It has been sad to see battle lines being drawn between idealogies that are leading to various sorts of dysfunction and partisanship.  RWF is a classic case of serious and real dysfunction.  No matter how I look at this governance literally between rock and hard place with RWF.   When I attempted to kindly suggest to @williamr about making some sort of form post on RWF status and state of affairs I was told to \u2018talk to Rune\u2019.    It honestly would have been nice to see @Rune show up to at least one G&R call or even a Delegate Call but I guess that is too much since he can\u2019t command the \u2018stage\u2019.    I see tons of people getting onboard the EndGame train and people even planning for it to come to pass like it is already passed,    Feel like I missed a signal request or poll on this subject.   Also I listened to hear the Hasu, Rune debate (not even sure I want to promote this debate) as I was pretty disappointed in both of them.  Rune definitely has a better command of Maker, Hasu made a number of statements that suggested lack of understanding of the protocol to my mind.   Neither case was succinctly made or well explained in the somewhat long debate imo and the views are distinctly opposed in some key areas that I don\u2019t see being easily resolved. Lastly in my final days as a delegate I want to express my appreciation for the time I have been allowed to be at MakerDAO.  Many of you very kind and considerate towards me as well as helpful. The generally high quality of people, diverse views, and \u2018with some minor exceptions\u2019 the high level of quality discussions/debates and overall interpersonal respect.   It is my hope that some middle ground can be reached between the Hasu/Rune views and politics and best wishes to all working at Maker.  MakerDAO is one of the most unique DAOs and one of (if not the) most important part of the DeFI ecosystem and if any group of people can build anti-fragility, decentralization, sustainably it would be MakerDAO\u2026  Best wishes and paths to success MakerDAO Maker Man ",
