                    "content": "Olympus DAO, as one of the largest DAI holders, is honored to submit the following application for the DAO to consider wsOHM as a collateral to be onboarded. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Olympus DAO 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Olympus is a Decentralized Reserve Currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FRAX) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Olympus also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. At a high level Olympus DAO features a single token, OHM, which is both the system\u2019s stable asset and its governance token. OHM primarily draws its value from its underlying basket of collateral, which at launch consisted solely of DAI and was then extended to hold FRAX and ETH. OHM can be staked in return for sOHM which allows OHM holders to accrue protocol profits as well as participate in Olympus DAO governance. When the Olympus DAO treasury distributes profits to the staking contract, stakers\u2019 sOHM balances rebase up to match the new amount of OHM in the contract so 1 sOHM always equals 1 OHM. In this way stakers receive compounding yield without them manually harvesting and reinvesting their profits. Users interacting with Olympus can i) buy OHM from Sushiswap with DAI, ii) buy OHM from Uniswap with FRAX iii) Bond DAI or FRAX for OHM at a market regulated discount. Olympus pioneered the bonding concept for two main purposes.   Reserve BOND. Bond offered to users that increases Olympus Reserves to back the intrinsic value of the token.   Liquidity BOND A bonding mechanism that allowed the protocol to own 100% of its liquidity pools. LPs holders bond their shares, in exchange for OHM at discount.   Olympus Pro   Olympus Pro is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions. Olympus Pro solves for liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee. Instead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the partners protocol\u2019s governance tokens at a discounted rate. Within a week of launching Olympus pro, has been able to secure 750K for its first 6 partners. (More details will be provided in the Olympus Pro proposal)  Picture1876\u00d7610 72 KB  Since launch in March 23, 2021, the protocol has accumulated 301 MM in net worth, distributed among treasury holdings and protocol owned liquidity of which as of August 31, 2021, 36.1MM DAI are in the [treasury] and 99.5MM DAI in the OHM-DAI v2 pool in sushiswap making Olympus hold 136MM DAI, a top 8 holder. !  Picture2936\u00d7638 77.7 KB   Picture3936\u00d7396 35.4 KB  We strongly believe that there is a natural synergy between Olympus and Maker. Adding wsOHM (the wrapped Staked OHM) will allow DAI to extend reserves to one of their largest holders and promoters. Our current OHM-DAI pool is Sushi has been top volume and liquidity for several weeks.  Picture5936\u00d7296 55.6 KB  3. Provide a brief history of the project. Olympus DAO was announced on February 1, 2021 and launched on March 23, 2021. The project was launched with an IDO (Initial DAO Offering) to all Discord active members that joined the community before March 3. An initial 360 members (Ohmies) participated of the IDO, investing 200,000 DAI. Today our community is the most vibrant of all DeFI with 22K Members. In its short life Olympus growth has been explosive being the protocol with the highest revenue in the industry, with an annualized revenue of approximately 3.5B.  Picture6740\u00d7548 138 KB  Even though at launch backing per OHM was 1:1 the growth in treasury and mainly DAI holdings increased backing almost 34 times. More information can be found at Dash Board 4.

Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Audits: Peckshield: Omniscia: 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Discord: Medium: Forum: Twitter: 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? Currently the applying collateral is used to participate in Olympus and in the growing ecosystem of partnerships.  The token allows user to be exposed to auto compounding APY in the DAO. User can participate in all DAO Decisions. User can post sOHM as collateral in Rari and take DAI loans. DAO is actively working with 33 potential partners. OHM is a fraction of Olympus DAO Treasury that allows user to participate in the protocol revenues by staking their OHM.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Olympus is fully Decentralized. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Exchange occurs in Sushiswap, Uniswap, OlympusDAO.finance, Rarifuse Pool #18 and Pool6 (as collaterals) 10. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. The are no regulatory registration or interaction with regulatory authorities. 11. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Olympus is currently listed in chainlink as the pair OHM/ETH and OHM/USD in Matic. ",

I will try to address some of these statements. OHM is a Ponzi No it\u2019s not. A ponzi scheme draws participants in by rewarding early members with the money given by newer members. There is no true profit in a ponzi - only \u201cmembership fees\u201d disguised as profit. Obviously this is non-sustainable as there is only X amount of people on the planet to make members. When the last member joins, there is no more \u201cprofit\u201d to onboard and the scheme collapses.  OHM is a fully backed reserve. The protocol can only mint 1 OHM if it is fed 1 RFV (Risk Free Value) token. This token can be FRAX, DAI, ETH - more assets are added to the treasury after being voted on by the DAO.  So, 1 DAI : 1 OHM. This simple rule means there is intrinsic value backing every single OHM created (unlike Bitcoin which has 0 intrinsic value apart from its community belief). This means OHM can never drop below 1 DAI in value. However, LIKE Bitcoin (and unlike stables that peg or closely follow the dollar price) OHM\u2019s upper price has no top and is decided by the market. This is where its unique bonding mechanism comes into play. Bonds are issued by the protocol whenever it see\u2019s wild speculation by the market on its token value. For etc if the market decides that OHM is worth 800 DAI the protocol will offer bonds below market price at (for example) 750 DAI. These bonds are how the protocol captures REAL profit (unlike a ponzi) because the protocol is the only institution that can mint new OHM. So, if Chad buys 1 OHM at bond for 750 DAI the protocol gives him 1 OHM and creates 749 new OHM which it stores as new supply. How to control inflation? Well, that new supply is rewarded to stakers (3,3) who keep supply off market to draw from these high yielding rewards. Over time as supply thickens, the yield APY drops (akin to the Bitcoin Halvening) making new OHM supply more scarce. Stakers (3,3) even harder as they continue to keep compounding which drives speculation etc. It\u2019s how commodity-backed money used to work before the gold standard was abolished in the 70\u2019s.

Generally, when talking about collateralized assets, it is in reference to stablecoins. The fact that 1 USDC is backed by 1 USD is a good thing, because we need it to be worth 1 USD. If USDC were backed by less than 1 USD it would be bad, because then there is a risk that 1 USDC is no longer worth 1 USD. OHM does not need to trade at any given price. It behaves more similarly to assets like ETH and BTC. If you want to make the backing argument here, it doesn\u2019t work very well. Yes, OHM is only partially backed but wait, ETH has no backing. Obviously a terrible collateral, right? OHM\u2019s backing, partial as it may be, is especially valuable in this case because a large portion of it is DAI. When this forum deliberates on new collaterals, the conversation at the forefront should always be \u201chow could this make DAI fail?\u201d The most significant risk any asset carries is that liquidations overwhelm the market and Maker is unable to take in enough DAI to settle vaults. Olympus is a significant DAI holder. The OHM-DAI Sushiswap pool, which is owns, is the second largest on-chain liquidity source for DAI on Ethereum (almost first!). Its reserve holdings exceed balances on many bridges and protocols. Both of these serve to mitigate the risk of OHM as a DAI collateral. Any time a liquidation need occur, there is a massive pool of liquidity to source the repayment. Another thing that is possible, but would require coordination between our communities, is an Olympus repo market in which it backstops liquidations with its own reserves in times of stress. All of this is to say that, in my opinion, OHM\u2019s partial DAI collateralization makes it likely the best DAI collateral you can find. ",

Pros for accepting OHM as collateral:  There\u2019s strong demonstrated borrow demand, as seen in Rari capital pools where users are frequently willing to pay double digit interest to borrow against their OHM OHM is a big DAI user, and while this doesn\u2019t outweigh risk considerations I think it makes sense to favor projects that are supportive of DAI in general OHM has significant DAI liquidity that is unlikely to be removed in times of stress (because it is owned by the protocol rather than users), which helps reduce downside risk  Risks of onboarding OHM / blockers:  OHM currently only trades on a few DEX venues with no CEX coverage - this could make it more difficult to create a safe oracle price feed (generally Maker is not willing to use Chainlink feeds) Significant admin priveledges are controlled by a multisig, with many of the signers remaining anonymous and without public reputation on the line. In a worst case scenario tokens could be minted or treasury assets removed, rendering the outstanding OHM tokens worthless OHM trades at a very high multiple to book value (20x or more), which suggests greater downside risk if market enthusiasm for OHM declines. Maybe Maker could account for this risk by adjusting liquidation ratios or capping the OHM oracle price depending on price/book value ratio.  Personally I think it should be possible to onboard OHM as long as we have suitable risk parameters. For example one of the Rari pools gives sOHM a 33% LTV (equivalent to 300% liquidation ratio) - this gives a lot of room for accommodating downside risk before MakerDAO would lose money. I see the admin and oracle risks as the biggest issues standing in the way of integration for the time being. If any OHM community members could clarify the multisig admin powers and any limits/safeguard in place (eg timelocks, mechanisms to cancel malicious actions, etc) this would be helpful! ",

This token can be FRAX, DAI, ETH - more assets are added to the treasury after being voted on by the DAO.  So, 1 DAI : 1 OHM. This simple rule means there is intrinsic value backing every single OHM created (unlike Bitcoin which has 0 intrinsic value apart from its community belief). This means OHM can never drop below 1 DAI in value.   In that case it makes sense to consider 1 DAI as the maximum amount you can mint using 1 OHM. Though it wouldn\u2019t be possible to liquidate such loan, so perhaps something like 2-3 DAI per 1 OHM will work better. ",

I see this as a great move that benefits both DAOs, reasoning below. Pros for Maker   Helps Dai stability by allowing it to borrow backing from other decentralized algostables without direct exposure (OHM will continue to expand its bonding program to a variety of good collateral stables and reserve assets like LUSD, FRAX , wETH and eventually Fei, Rai etc).   Helps users like me who avoid keeping 100% realized profits in Dai due to its centralized backing risk from USDC.   I think this is a great opportunity for Maker to diversify backing of Dai away from centalized USDC, and think the objections raised so far around \u201cponzi schemes\u201d and partial Dai backing make little coherent sense. OHM follows the well known central bank model to create a liquid reserve asset that other DeFi liabilities can be traded against, the people who have called it a ponzi scheme seem to not understand economics in general, let alone cryptoeconomics.

In no way is OHM better collateral than ETH. The protocol owned liquidity is a large portion of the DAI that Olympus \u2018owns\u2019 and I love the bonding mechanism I think that is a real innovation for defi but much of that DAI can easily be lost if everyone sells their ohm after realizing they paid 900$ for something backed by 30$ or whatever the RFV currently is. This \u2018liquidity\u2019 can dry up fast especially considering the amount of unrealized gains that stakers have right now and how much of the borrow demand from rari is to just buy and stake more OHM. Add to this the fact that a multisig of anons can mint ohm at will, I think this poses a large risk to maker for not much benefit. On the other hand this proposal would massively benefit olympus, by expanding further and making them a systemic risk to defi, they become too big to fail. If OHM is onboarded as collateral to maker the LTV should be extremely low (as low as the RFV) and we should also onboard renDoge as collateral since were backing dai with memes now ",

This is in regards to the OHM ERC-20 contract itself. I\u2019ll just copy a few of my own messages from the OlympusDAO server that I posted when I noticed this during my own review of the contracts:  Original message  I really don\u2019t want to be annoying but I think the issue I previously raised with ownership of the OHM ERC-20 contract (0x383518188C0C6d7730D91b2c03a03C837814a899) is more severe than I really conveyed. Since its owner  (0x763A641383007870ae96067818f1649E5586f6DE) is a single key (not a multisig), if this single key is compromised, it can call setVault to an address it controls to be able call mint (which is behind an onlyVault guard) to mint as much OHM as it wants to any address as the recipient. It would probably be a very good idea to update the owner of the OHM contract to one of the dev-controlled multisigs (like 0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B which controls the treasury) very soon. Alternately, the owner of this contract could be set to the null address which would mitigate this, but it would be come impossible to call setVault if the vault needed to be migrated to a new contract for some reason   Message #2   The risk is stated in my original message, but to summarise:   The treasury itself is a lot safer, it is controlled by a developer multisig, as detailed in the docs (and I confirmed that this is the case on chain too)   The sOHM contract is controlled by a single key, but the damage it can cause if compromised is limited, largely limited to messing up the index in rebase events logged which will make analytics harder, but as far as I can tell, the index value in this contract is purely informational, it\u2019s not used by the actual rebase calculations   The OHM contract is controlled by a single key (different from the one that controls sOHM). If compromised, setOwner can be called to update the owner to another address, and to call setVault to change the treasury contract address to an address the attacker controls. The main point of concern here is the address set as vault in the OHM contract is able to call mint to create new OHM and assign them to any address of it\u2019s choosing. Were this key compromised it could not steal treasury funds or token balances, but it could dilute the OHM supply outside the defined parameters   The follow on from this, is since an attacker could mint OHM for free, they could use this free  OHM to crash the price and drain any LP pairs containing OHM. This means the LP tokens in the treasury could be devalued, but the dai, frax & weth in treasury are still safe in this scenario  The response I received to this is that the key in question was irretrievably lost (faulty hardware wallet without backup) and that there would be a migration to a new token contract at some point in the future, as any methods beyond an onlyOwner guard on the current contract can no longer be called, if the key in question is truly lost.  Regarding the treasury itself As per the documentation, the treasury is currently under the control of a four-of-seven developer multisig (a Gnosis Safe instance). As such, the project is not currently trustless - the developers retain a privileged position until such a point where the project migrates to on-chain governance. I personally feel the risk of malicious actions to be extremely low, in large part due to all the efforts to integrate with other projects and to build relationships & partnerships in the wider defi ecosystem. These are not actions I would expect a project intending to rug pull or otherwise scam to undertake. ",

Don\u2019t care what anyone says 1 key here and the entire system compromised.   This one point alone is sufficient to deny this MIP6 application. Oracles going to be a key issue.  I don\u2019t see how this is overcome in the short term.  I actually looked over the documentation linked here. Some interesting quotes to take into account the realities of this.  \" OHM is backed, not pegged.  Each OHM is backed by 1 DAI, not pegged to it. Because the treasury backs every OHM with at least 1 DAI, the protocol would buy back and burn OHM when it trades below 1 DAI. This has the effect of pushing OHM price back up to 1 DAI. OHM could always trade above 1 DAI because there is no upper limit imposed by the protocol. Think pegged == 1, while backed >= 1. You might say that the OHM floor price or intrinsic value is 1 DAI. We believe that the actual price will always be 1 DAI + premium, but in the end that is up to the market to decide.\" Hence by definition the system is \u2018capturing\u2019 value when OHM is > 1 anyone who buys OHM above 1DAI in price is basically giving their money away to the system.   OHM to pay out its high rewards is a rebasing token.   So for each 1% you think you earn by the rebase the price in the LPs is dropping.  So far money is moving in filling the coffers, LPs and causing postiive rebases.   Just look at the reasons for buying and the whole return statements in the document.  2%/day APY and up to 100000% APYs - seriously folks this is the new monetary policy that you want the world to be based on?   Lets forget about every other asset in this system and just look at using DAI to back OHM 1:1 - if you thought about this system from just being one kind of stablecoin OMH being backed by another stablecoin DAI - you\u2019d just say this is a rehypothication of DAI to OHM.   Ask yourself what is the product being offered here. The document has the answer: \" Is OHM a stable coin? No, OHM is not a stable coin. Rather, OHM aspires to become an algorithmic reserve currency backed by other decentralized assets. Similar to the idea of the gold standard, OHM provides free floating value its users can always fall back on, simply because of the fractional treasury reserves OHM draws its intrinsic value from.\" \u2018fractional treasury reserves\u2019 and no it isn\u2019t a stablecoin because unlike DAI and Maker that did not seek to profit from DAI PEG running high (which we do to some extent with PSM tin/tout but not to the extend OHM is doing) we try to keep the PEG at 1+/-tin/tout this protocol seeks to profit from this price disparity.   BTW:  This whole 1OHM = 1DAI idea flies flat in the face of another statement made in that document. \" Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting using stablecoins knowing that they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. But this is a fallacy. The dollar is controlled by the US government and the Federal Reserve. This means a depreciation of dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. OlympusDAO aims to solve this by creating a free-floating reserve currency, OHM, that is backed by a basket of assets. By focusing on supply growth rather than price appreciation, OlympusDAO hopes that OHM can function as a currency that is able to hold its purchasing power regardless of market volatility\" Yet as quoted OHM is backed by 1 DAI + \u2018something\u2019 which related to a staking, bonding model of behavior that is supposed to manage value accrual to the system beyond 1DAI per OHM. The big argument for OHM is that Bitcoin and ETH basically are backed by \u2018nothing\u2019 so hell why not OHM. Maker stands in stark contrast to this and other models by being fully liquid in the collateral, and DAI backing value is overcollateralized.  Maker offers clients the ability to borrow a token that yes trades with $1US value (I know there probably were a lot of debates why this value was chosen and not some other defining value basket and defer this argument for another thread) but is fully backed by collateral value exceeding the DAI notional value in $$.  This system is not fully backed especially at these 20x book valuations. What I see this OHM system doing is presenting the user with massive returns, to get them to buy OHM at prices far over what the backing value is at the time, so the system can bank some of this value difference which is only going to buy back the tokens when the OHM value drops below 1DAI.    This is straight up a hype value sink designed to trap people high and exit them low. Not one single person in their right mind should pay more than 1DAI/OHM and if I were to add if Maker decides to onboard OHM it should basically treat it as a stablecoin.   1.2OHM can maybe borrow 1DAI because that is what the actual OHM system says the intrinsic value is,  in fact that system is designed to move that value eventually to that 1OHM = 1DAI + \u2018this not so defined\u2019 something.     Right now you could basically look to buy OHM at or below book value and maybe try to play a speculative game but in the end the way this system is constructed is that if you are paying more than 1 DAI per OHM you will eventually find yourself diluted so that eventually 1OHM is basically worth 1DAI.  Now will the rebasing returns you got actually offset the OHM reduction in value.    Depends on when you bought and whether the system is still getting inflows or outflows. Ultimately the individuals earning the maximum value are the early stakers while as time goes on there will be less and less pie to share and the OHM price will start dropping.   Look at the parabolic rise in those charts at some point all liquidity would run out and the fuel to sustain the growth and hence the returns is going to stop and this will lead to a supernova type collapse that the system is designed to handle, BUT ONLY when the OHM price is below 1DAI/OHM. So I am not going to say ponzi.  I am going to say unsustainable by design.    I am also going to say there are significant issues not to onboard OHM at a minimum that would need to be cleared up. Also like @monet-supply suggests we can certainly onboard this and put a very high LR and even a higher LF to buffer the system here against losses.   In the end I have another concern and this is regulatory. I am not saying OHM is some illegal ponzi, but what if MakerDAO didn\u2019t see through an addition that basically rug pulled using DAI and trapped a whole bunch of people in something.   I can see such an event would be like a light to the regulator mosquito - urging them to bite us. I have often had this concern about what happens if a blacklisted address were to drop wBTC or ETH into the protocol and mint DAI.   As far as I know Maker can\u2019t do one thing about this and in this sense Maker becomes complicit in criminal activities and brings the protocol under huge scrutiny.  It is why when we weigh collateral additions via MIP6 the community and DAO has to have significant scrutiny. One thing I have wanted to change with MIP6 proposals is that at least one CU should have to co-sponsor them.   This way we have some accountability and control within the protocol CU structure over what proposals are even submitted and these create a lot of churn and discussion eating up valuable community productivity.  I want to see these but I also want to know at least one CU is in favor of them because they are good additions already basically vetted by at least one person in the protocol before put up for consideration by the community.

Lets break that down so we can analyze what risks OHM poses to Maker Dao. You may have seen the (3,3) which is a reference to Olympus Dao\u2019s game theory.  It states that if I don\u2019t sell and you don\u2019t sell then we both will benefit.  There\u2019s a special name for this type of game and it is called the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.  The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma shows why two rational people may not cooperate.  Olympus has managed, so far, to keep everyone cooperating.  They initially accomplished this by limiting the first tokens to their discord community.  They continue to accomplish this with the (3,3) peer-pressure campaign and the promise of massive staking APYs. What is Olympus Dao\u2019s product?  Originally there wasn\u2019t one.  Oympus sells OHM with the promise that buyers can stake OHM for huge APYs.  Where did the APY come from?  It comes from the money new investors put into the protocol when they buy new tokens.  Some people call this a ponzi scheme, but there\u2019s nothing clandestine, Olympus Dao is perfectly transparent about what they are doing. Olympus likes to claim the OHM they sell as revenue which is exciting because revenue comes from selling products.   But selling new equity in your company is not revenue, its equity, and its dilution. Olympus aspires to be the reserve currency of crypto.  It reminds me of another popular reserve currency \u2013 the US Dollar.  The Olympus treasury and dao are controlled by a 4 of 7 multisig, kind of a like a federal reserve vote.  OHM has no supply cap and new supply is currently hyperinflationary.  I thought we all got into crypto for the decentralization and sound money, is this some sort of sick joke? Olympus recently launched OlympusPro.  OlympusPro is a real product with audited and tested smart contracts.  It is exciting and other projects are using it.  Olympus managed to bootstrap themselves for several months on nothing but promises.  They\u2019ve released their first real product and hopefully they can deliver or its only a matter of time before the prisoners kill each other. Recommendation \u2013 Do not accept OHM as collateral on Maker Dao.  Wait for the project to become decentralized, their OlympusPro product to mature, and their inflation to taper. ",

If we take the market value of Olympus\u2019 treasury, OHM market cap is 5x levered over treasury (was 7x until yesterday), and probably 25x if we exclude amounts in the liquidity pools, so let\u2019s say it\u2019s somewhere in between. I think DAI represents 70-80% of that treasury. What that means, de facto, is that OHM is a levered play on the DAI by a factor of c. 10-20x. DAI, itself, is a currency backed by a certain amount of diversified collateral with a certain measure of (over)collateralisation. By using OHM as a collateral, DAI would amplify the implied leverage of its balance sheet in a way that Maker cannot control, leaving to others the ability to impact its economic policy and making in general such balance sheet more levered/ riskier. I don\u2019t think that doing that is a good idea. But I would be open to be convinced otherwise. ",

Depending on jurisdiction, there could be significant tax advantages to borrowing funds from MakerDAO versus selling a portion of their holdings. So for these users, minting DAI with lower rates and a higher collateral ratio could be a good deal even if Fuse offers a higher leverage / lower collateral ratio option. On another note, Olympus just published this update on v2:  twitter.com    OlympusDAO \ud83d\udd4a @OlympusDAO    We are very excited to share with you...Olympus V2 olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-ol\u2026   11:55 PM - 14 Oct 2021           1.2K                290            This upgrade looks like it includes on chain governance of treasury assets and bond mechanism, along with migration to new contracts to remediate security risks of OHM v1. I think this would help with the case for onboarding when these updates are in place. ",

                    "content": "I wanted to respond specifically on this thread about Field Technologies\u2019 vote No on green lighting OHM as possible collateral. (NB: Typically Field Technologies votes Abstain unless there is a compelling reason not to) Several things about the design of OHM concern me from the standpoint of accepting it as collateral. The first is the faulty contract that can mint OHM that has been detailed upthread. I have been told this contract will be retired soon, but it is an obvious red flag until that actually occurs. Probably more intractable is the (very clever) business model of OHM. At first glance, this looks like a common Ponzi scheme. New investors are required to pay old investors who wish to exit. But there are several qualities that make OHM different from a Ponzi scheme. Here are my takeaways (some good, some bad, some merely ugly):   It pays in its own scrip. Olympus DAO can never run out of \u201cmoney.\u201d   That scrip (OHM) is backed but not pegged by around $1 in assets. Any price deviation above $1 is based upon ???   The marketing of OHM has been pretty clever \u2013 you even see celebrities like Grimes doing the (3,3) thing. It appeals to people\u2019s idea that they are smarter than others, can collude in a type of exclusive club of similar minds, and you slap the name of Greek deities on it. Everything that I\u2019ve seen to date is actually done out in the open, but the documentation, explanations from key members, and marketing materials all tend to make things more complex than they need to be. That makes me feel that obfuscation is a goal, but not to the point of fraud.   The OHM supply is expanding rapidly. This is by design, but probably not the design that most people assume. A separate, special type of OHM, called pOHM, was sold to investors via private placement. pOHM functions as a call option on OHM at a $1 strike. There is a limit of 11.8% of all OHM supply being converted pOHM, apparently. I am unclear if or how quickly this 11.8% parameter can change. 450 million pOHM were sold or awarded to investors and Olympus DAO insiders. As you can see, any price above $1 allows for 100% of all pOHM to exit profitably once OHM supply hits around 4 billion. It is also notable that the pOHM generally all vests by the time a 100% exit is possible.   Number 4 combined with Olympus DAO\u2019s novel staking strategy lead me to conclude that OHM is by its design intended to be a bubble/Ponzi whose purpose is to aggressively market to unsophisticated/trusting users, use unit bias so that large APY can obscure the extreme dilution, and then provide an exit for pOHM holders. True to their famed game theory, the pOHM doesn\u2019t vest until the bubble is fully inflated, thereby maximizing gains for all pOHM holders. The (3,3) meme is most appropriate with regard to the insiders holding pOHM rather than regular OHM holders, whose purpose seems to be to provide gains in a zero-sum game to pOHM holders.   Conclusion: This looks to be like a slow-moving, cleverly designed ploy to transfer wealth from OHM holders to pOHM holders in a zero- or negative-sum game. It\u2019s very clever, and perhaps will find a way through other product offerings to be useful, but the core product looks like a very slow moving, probably legal rug pull. That strikes me as a bad user experience by design. Leaving aside the supposed $1 floor in value for OHM, I don\u2019t think Maker should be doing business with collateral that is designed for this purpose. We may as well onboard all dog money if we are that mercenary and callous towards holders of a collateral asset. I\u2019m posting these concerns here so they may be addressed. Note that Field Technologies\u2019 vote not to green light OHM as collateral will not change until the OHM-printing contract is rendered harmless, but these other concerns about the very design of Olympus DAO would need to be addressed fully even without that suspicious contract.

Gavin in 2010 vs OHM That\u2019s Olympus today. 10 months in, 70k+ community members, 11k+ DAO members. Distributed team. On and On. Very unfair comparison as BTC was starting an industry, so 10 month in it was way more centralized than what OHM is now. We all learned during this 12 years. My only point is that you should never rush conclusions or victories. Let\u2019s see in 2033 and compare OHM 2033 with BTC 2022. ",

That\u2019s why I mentioned that I didn\u2019t think it was fair to compare OHM with BTC, because it\u2019s obvious the big difference. The most you could do was to do it with CURVE. I hope you reread again and can see what exactly I mentioned . ",

Also, a more substantial doubt is if the value goes down because of the treasury, what would back up that OHM? As I have seen from the comments of its own creators, they point to a rational market, when we know that the cryptomarket is very emotional. ",
