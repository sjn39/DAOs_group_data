This will also be true for our Member Directory. For deeper integrations, we will provide API support for read/write operations to various aspect of the CharmVerse use case. Team Who are your founders?: Alex Poon (Co-founder, CEO) Alex is responsible for growth, product and BD at CharmVerse. He is a 3X founder. Prior to CharmVerse, he co-founded [x.ai](http://x.ai/), an AI-powered personal assistant (raised $45M, exit), and Visual Revenue, a real-time predictive analytics platform for editorial teams (exit). He holds a patent on a content placement algorithm. Earlier in his career, as an engineer at Lockheed Martin, he built software for unmanned aerial vehicles. Matt Casey (Co-founder, CTO) Matt is responsible for tech and product at CharmVerse. He co-founded [x.ai](http://x.ai/) with Alex and has been working with Alex since 2012, across 3 companies. As the CTO of [x.ai](http://x.ai/), he architected and built the initial product and scaled it to the company\u2019s exit. Prior to CharmVerse, he taught himself solidity, wrote a smart contract, minted, and sold a set of NFTs. What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: We are experienced founders who have a track record in shipping production-grade projects. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): We are a team of 11 builders and growth marketers. Besides the founders, our head of product is the founder of PurpleDAO, a DAO that supports the Farcaster ecosystem, and a Noun delegate. Is this your first Web3 project?: Yes though we have been around for 1.5 yrs. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post : [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: Yes, we have about 2+ years of runway Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? CharmVerse is a complex project with many code paths that support various use cases. To properly integrate Optimism, we need to apply significant design, engineering, and QA resources. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: For each feature, we will  Create low fidelity mockup/prototype Conduct user interviews/research Create high fidelity design Code Deploy feature in our staging environment with testnet QA Deploy feature in our staging environment with mainnet QA  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) N/A Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Yes. We are a big fan of the Optimism ecosystem and are eager to be part of it. Though the partnership should be a two-way street. A grant from Optimism is the first step toward an impactful, long-term relationship. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: CharmVerse is committed to holding OP for a period of 1 year. After a period of 1 year or after unlocked, CharmVerse hopes to cover costs associated with the areas below in completing this project:  Engineering - 60% Product Design - 15% QA/Support - 15% Marketing - 10%  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. Milestone 1: Net increase of 100 users since the approval of the OP grants Milestone 2: Net increase of 500 users since the approval of the OP grants Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Milestone 1: In the staging environment, users can earn/lose role(s) based on OP token/NFT holdings in their wallets Milestone 2: In the production environment, users can earn/lose role(s) based on OP token/NFT holdings in their wallets Milestone 3: In the staging environment, users can pay bounties/grants with OP tokens. Milestone 4: In the production environment, users can pay bounties/grants with OP tokens. Milestone 5: In the staging environment, users can select OP NFT as their PFP and choose to showcase OP NFTs in their profile Milestone 6: In the production environment, users can select OP NFT as their PFP and choose to showcase OP NFTs in their profile Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Optimism communities are currently stuck with disconnected web2 tools like Discord and Discourse combined with fragmented web3 protocols. It is difficult for communities to onboard and engage users who have a limited attention span and expect excellent UX. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: The CharmVerse platform provides a seamless experience for OP users to build relationships, collaborate, and vote. It does this while giving users access to the superpower of web3. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: CharmVerse enables both crypto-native and crypto-curious users to onboard and engage communities. As we enable more users to build communities in Optimism, more builders will be excited to build here. Furthermore, CharmVerse has a track record of integrating with other web3 platforms/tools. Our success in the Optimism ecosystem will benefit other community tool builders. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We are very committed to the Optimism ecosystem and see this integration as a first step of a long and fruitful relationship. Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Optimism communities are currently stucked with disconnected web2 tools like Discord and Discourse combined with fragmented web3 protocols. It is difficult for communities to onboard and engage users who have limited attention span and expect amazing UX. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: The CharmVerse platform provides a seamless experience for OP users to build relationships, collaborate, and vote. It does this while giving users access to the superpower of web3. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: CharmVerse enables both crypto-native and crypto-curious users to onboard and engage communities. As we enable more users to build communities in Optimism, more builders will be excited to build here. Furthermore, CharmVerse has a track record of integrating with other web3 platforms/tools. Our success in the Optimism ecosystem will benefit other community tool builders. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We are very committed to the Optimism ecosystem and see this integration as a first step of a long and fruitful relationship.
