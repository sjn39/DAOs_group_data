As you mentioned, you are quite new to this. Maybe spend some time to understand why various parameters are set the way they are before accusing people of scamming. Regarding stability fee. We had them all set to zero for some time, it has very little effect on the peg in comparison to 2-4% and it has a huge downside (that we cannot start to decentralize the protocol because there is no money available to pay anyone to do anything.) You can find some background on that decision here. If you feel Maker and DAI are shitcoins and don\u2019t want to take the time to understand why parameters are set the way they are then please find another group of people to annoy. ",
