Why am I even bothering you with this? Because he was kind enough to also include a Maker-Badge in the generator so you are able to create something like this:  As I did some testing I was having access to a special link to mint before the launch. I am happy to share it with you, so you can be ahead of the wave - no financial advice  The app takes a origination fee of 0.005 ETH, no royalties on opensea. Enjoy! ",

I had three main reasons why I started this project:  I\u2019m a total generative arts fan and wanted to build something again that has (at least a little bit) to do with art. I became aware of CryptoPunks super late, but I liked the punks themselves. To be honest: not for todays price   I wanted to do another project that interacts with a smart contract, and deploy on mainnet for the first time.  I always appreciate feedback! The elements are not set in stone: If anyone has requests for more elements or improvements I\u2019m happy to add them. Have fun with the punks! ",
