While you are welcome to attend both, the objective with having two calls is to accommodate for expected scheduling conflicts for many in the community. The objective is a robust discussion into the legal structures, the money flow, the secured nature of the transaction(s), how this can scale, and of course the underlying projects and business model (and specifically why it is a good fit for MakerDAO with regard to risk profile). Tenatative Agenda  Background on being an off-chain lender (e.g. differences between secured and unsecured) - 10 minutes  30,000 ft overview of the proposal and the business behind it - 15 minutes  Detailed step by step of the MIP - 20 minutes  Extended Q&A - however long the community wants to keep asking questions   Scheduling Conference calls are being schedule after both the community call on Tuesday and after the governance call on Thursday. Zoom Join us via Zoom Meeting ID: 863 1227 6278 Each meeting is planned to be recorded. The recordings will subsequently be shared in this thread thereafter. ",

The calls will cover legal structures, money flow, scalability, and the business model behind the proposal. The author will also provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of the MIP. The meetings will be recorded and shared in the thread. The post mainly falls under the category of 3rd party asking questions about the proposal, but also includes the author explaining the proposal, 3rd party giving constructive criticism, 3rd party or author wanting to collaborate, and 3rd party auditing and reviewing the proposal.",
