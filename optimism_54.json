What needs to be done is issue them to the ones that were apart of the project that did not receive the airdrop. Why is OP here? Why are they helping with the scaling of Ethereum? Whales can afford to use and pay Ethereum fees where most daily users can not. So I believe the ones that used the bridge and paid crazy high eth fees to bridge over to be a part of this ecosystem should be treated the same as the rest and they should receive the left over tokens from airdrop. That is my belief not only because I was one of them people but also because I believe in fairness and that if you want your ecosystem to continue to grow we would want everyone involved and none left out. If you notice more and more of these people are flocking to other eco systems like bsc or pls. It is  because these other chains are targeting these people wanting them apart of it and create equal opportunities for them to be apart of there community. If not nothing will change, and you will continue to just drive those groups away. Imagine this will be pushed off but in fairness is the right thing to do. These are my opinion and you don\u2019t got to reply to tell me yours! Opinions are like buttholes everyone has one. ",
