Highlights  Nearly 9.5 million DAI was bridged to Optimism last week, begging the question: rollup szn? Over 12 million DAI was bridged to Solana last week. This despite the blockchain\u2019s CEO shutting down the network for nearly an entire day. The sources are yet to be determined, but one wallet currently holds 99.9% of DAI circulating on Solana. BSC\u2019s top mover was\u2026 Binance Hot Wallets, which saw an influx of over 82 million DAI last week. Is this simple wallet aggregation or is DAI leaving the comfort of cold storage to hit exchanges?   Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  917\u00d7376 47.6 KB  This week saw slight decreases across the board, outside of minor upticks in the \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Treasuries\u2019 categories. \u2018Other\u2019 is an aggregate of Aragon, Tornado Cash, and PulseChain - and \u2018Treasuries\u2019 represents Olympus DAO.

                    "content": " Dai on Different Networks #13  If you missed last week\u2019s update, here\u2019s a link to Dai on Different Networks #12.  Dai on Different Networks: The Dashboard (soft-launch)  I created a dashboard to track some of the stats I\u2019ve been reporting in real-time. Dune Analytics currently tracks Ethereum and Polygon proficiently, but databases for the other L1s and L2s are limited or non-existent - BUT more are being added every week. As more information becomes available this dashboard will be updated! With the dashboard now available, we\u2019ve made some changes to the format; namely, an extension of the highlight section and a pivot to focus on any anomalies seen over the course of the week. Hopefully, this format will prove to be a more valuable week-to-week format. As always - we\u2019re open to any and all suggestions.  Now, on to the meat and potatoes.  Highlights Liquidity Mining Incentives have become the new normal in our multi-chain world, with each announcement boasting a higher and higher total. This can be seen with Polygon\u2019s $40mil program, Algorand\u2019s $300mil program, Fantom\u2019s $370mil program, and now Avalanche Rush - a $700mil program bolstered by an inital $180mil from the Avalanche Foundation, as well as large contributions from Aave and Curve. As the Rush began a slew of announcements came from the AVAX team, including:  Trader Joe, the network\u2019s top DEX by volume, launched a $20mil incentives program to be used for yield rewards and a bug bounty program. Trader Joe already has over 1.25bil locked in its protocol. Kyber Network, a decentralized liquidity hub, is allocating $5mil to launch the network\u2019s first Dynamic Market Maker(DMM). Yield Yak will receive a $100k incentive to be disbursed to network developers. Avalanche claims this will be the first developer-centric liquidity allocation. While no date is set, the Aave team has confirmed an upcoming integration and has hinted at stout liquidity mining incentives.  In the wake of the news another 12 million Dai was bridged to the network, primarily into Benqi and Trader Joe. On the other hand, Solana saw a massive drop-off of over 11 million Dai or an 81% decrease in week-over-week circulation. The timing comes after the release of Solana\u2019s native Phantom wallet, a Metamask competitor, which has seen over 500k downloads since its release. So one possibility is Dai is now being stored in Phantom wallets. A second is Huobi\u2019s release of a SOL-USDC pair. Solana now claims to hold over $2bil in native USDC. Whether DAI was rotated into USDC, or held in Phantom wallets - it\u2019s movement to keep an eye on. The xDAI chain is holding steady at around 22mil bridged DAI, totaling around a 67% increase over the last three months. And last but not least - let\u2019s address Rollup szn. Still definitely underway with another 14% increase in Dai circulating on Optimism, as well as over 7mil in Dai bridged to Arbitrum. For perspective, on August 12th, Optimism only accounted for just over 4mil Dai. Rollups are growing, and fast.  Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  916\u00d7370 55.2 KB  This week brings a few changes to the Overview, courtesy of @SebVentures, including the addition of a \u2018Bridge\u2019 section, as well as updates to the CeFi category. We also had a large drop in total Dai held on custodial exchanges which coincided with increases in Dai circulating on DEXs, Lending Protocols, and Bridges.

This influx comes in the wake of the Avalanche Rush Liquidity Incentives Program. All other L1\u2019s saw decreases in circulating Dai, though Polygon\u2019s volume has stabilized at around 300mil DAI.

With so much activity happening on-chain, we\u2019ll continue to track Avalanche\u2019s top wallets as the network grows. To start, here\u2019s a brief rundown of Avalanche\u2019s three-chain network:  The Contract (C-Chain) chain is EVM compliant, allowing devs to copy/paste projects and enabling easier bridging for end-users. Platform (P-Chain) chain controls validators and creates \u201csubnets\u201d or sharded side-chains. The Exchange (X-Chain) chain is used for the creation and exchange of assets.  We\u2019ll be focusing on the C-Chain, where nearly all the network\u2019s current Dapps are housed.

Curve has maintained the top wallet, but second place has been a revolving door. This week was a great example of this as a combined 34 million Dai exited Curve and SpookySwap. The primary on-chain benefactor is the Scream protocol, seeing a cool ~16mil Dai flood the platform.

Highlights  After a brief trial run, I can confidently report: definitely Rollup sznnn! As a whole, Rollups saw an increase in circulating DAI of around 865% in only seven days. Avalanche is growing and fast. Another 20mil DAI flood the network, and the chain\u2019s seen its TVL grow from 0.5bil to around 5bil since the beginning of August. Klaytn is continuing to stack massive real-world partnerships. After its recent announcement as the chain of choice for the Bank of South Korea\u2019s CBDC pilot program, the good news just keeps rolling. This time it\u2019s Maekyung Media Group, which aims to spearhead a new wave of Korean digital media innovation.   Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  918\u00d7374 47.3 KB  Not a lot of movement this week, but we did see a slight decrease in Dai used for Lending and an increase in the \u201cOther\u201d category - with  \u201cOther\u201d being an aggregate of Dai in Aragon, Tornado Cash, and PulseChain.

BSC and Optimism were recently added and functionality is slowly being fleshed out. Getting conflicting information on various Avalanche explorers, so the current total reflects total DAI and DAI.e and includes BENQI\u2019s current DAI.e supply. We\u2019ll be aggregating the borrow/repay queries, and digging deeper into internal BSC movement. Have anything you\u2019d like to see added to these breakdowns?

Highlights  MakerDAO now accepts MATIC as collateral.  The Avalanche C-Chain saw exponential growth in recent weeks, jumping to over 282 million in circulating DAI. The current top wallets include Trader Joe (kudos to @ElProgresso), Snowball, and Pangolin. The number of Dai on Fantom grew by around 76% over the past week, due in part to several announcements, including a 370 million FTM incentive program, and an increase in NFT-fueled traffic. Klaytn Announces the Klaytn Foundation.  Solana announces a global hackathon.

Highlights  Fantom continues to grow, positioning itself as the fourth-largest EVM-compliant network. In the last two weeks alone, we\u2019ve seen an 80% increase in circulating DAI on the platform. Wouldn\u2019t have guessed that it would be NFTs that sparked the multi-chain movement, but here we are! Uniswap\u2019s dominance of the DEX market has begun to show signs of fracturing, as money moves to various chains. On the Binance side of things, Quickswap has been moving up the charts and is now firmly entrenched as the second-largest Dai holder on the chain.   Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  918\u00d7373 47 KB  This week saw a healthy increase of around 1.5% between DEXs and Lending protocols and another 1.2% decrease in \u2018Other\u2019- which is an aggregate of Aragon, Tornado Cash, and PulseChain.
