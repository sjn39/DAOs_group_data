Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Rocket Pool is an Ethereum 2.0 Proof of Stake infrastructure service. rETH is a redemption token representing staked ETH. Without a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions. Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the wealth threshold. Abstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership). \u2018Our Vision\u2019 Blog Post  3. Provide a brief history of the project.  2017 - Rocket Pool proof of concept based on the specifications released for Casper in the Mauve paper by Vitalik Buterin. Today there is a great team working on Rocket Pool passionately alongside a fantastic community. Both have helped Rocket Pool run two public betas with over 50,000 ETH (testnet) staked and hundreds of users participating over the last 1\u20132 years. With the transition to PoS on the horizon, Rocket Pool propounds Ethereum core values, advancing decentralized staking.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Website - rocketpool.net Whitepaper GitHub Repository FAQ  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.   EDDC - Consensys Diligence Sigma Prime Trail of Bits  These are the audits and then this has fairly accurate liquidity numbers - https://forum.abracadabra.money/t/rfc-adding-a-reth-cauldron-to-abracadabra-lending-markets/1862 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Rocket Pool Governance Forum  Discord - Public discussion group  Blog - Announcements / FAQ / Public disclosures. Twitter Node Operators Guide  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used?  rETH is used as a commodity by people wishing to passively provide stake in the Ethereum network. rETH represents a claim to ETH deposits and staking rewards in the Rocket Pool protocol.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Brisbane, Queensland (QLD)  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?  Uniswap, Balancer It is intended that rETH will be able to be exchanged wherever ETH is exchanged.  Liquidity (End of year 2021) rETH 37,719 Total supply $135m Market capitalization Snapshot of rETH liquidity positions:  Uniswap: $6.12m total liquidity with 86 ETH (Uniswap Info) Balancer: $680k total liquidity with 104 ETH (Balancer) Rocket Pool deposit pool: $5.6m liquidity with 1,596 ETH   The Rocket Pool deposit pool is funds waiting to be matched with node operators, it provides liquidity for those wanting to exit rETH positions and has the benefit of no trade slippage. L2 positions:  Uniswap Arbitrum - $1.99m total liquidity with 101 ETH  Uniswap Optimism - $399k total liquidity with 66.99 WETH  Uniswap Polygon - TBC but we are are expecting 200k liquidity to be included in the next couple of days  ",

Back to the correct rETH from Rocketpool, with which I also have some concerns;  At current supply of 29k tokens, which brings us to $120m market cap, we will likely not be able to issue a large amount of debt, assuming we don\u2019t want to hold a considerable amount of total supply. This can lead to the vault type being unprofitable due to costs related to maintenance. To my knowledge the only market is Uni v3 with $4.5m rETH liquidity and $5.38m rETH/ETH pair liquidity. There is much more rETH (1100) than ETH (230) in the pool, which results in a situation where you can only sell 230 rETH. Based on this situation the debt ceiling would need to be below 1m dai.  Until market liquidity is significantly increased I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to add rETH as collateral. ",

I realize the importance of the ETH ecosystem and I am a supporter of the innovation happening with staking solutions. For the Maker protocol, there are specific requirements and guidelines we need to meet before onboarding a collateral type. Yes, the past was a little different and now, we\u2019re committed to doing a better job of communicating the guidelines upfront like market cap, liquidity, and costs like Oracles. And, there is always the strategic consideration that comes into play when onboarding collateral. Others can debate and decide on whether Maker is in the position to drive rETH like WBTC and stETH.

Depth and breath of liquidity for rETH is now a key focus for the core team and community. rETH is now at 37,719 supply and a market cap of $135m. Here is a snapshot of our rETH liquidity positions:  Uniswap: $6.12m total liquidity with 86 ETH (Uniswap Info) Balancer: $680k total liquidity with 104 ETH (Balancer) Rocket Pool deposit pool: $5.6m liquidity with 1,596 ETH   The Rocket Pool deposit pool is funds waiting to be matched with node operators, it provides liquidity for those wanting to exit rETH positions. It has been quite consistently above 1k ETH for the last 4 weeks. Long-term we believe this trend (high rETH demand vs node operator supply) will continue, providing a significant source of liquidity. The Rocket Pool deposit pool also has the benefit of no trade slippage. For reference, in case it is relevant I have included our L2 positions here:  Uniswap Arbitrum - $1.99m total liquidity with 101 ETH  Uniswap Optimism - $399k total liquidity with 66.99 WETH  Uniswap Polygon - TBC but we are are expecting 200k liquidity to be included in the next couple of days  Is our current level of liquidity acceptable? - particularly if we are able to include the Rocket Pool deposit pool.

                    "content": "Hey @darrenlangley, Thank you for providing these details! In the case where liquidity in the Rocket Pool deposit pool can be used without restrictions - waiting time, quantity vise and that anyone is able to use it - the pool can be considered equal to any other permissionless on-chain liquidity sources like AMM pools. We just want to be sure that rETH used as collateral can be sold in a timely manner without a large price impact. L2 & sidechain liquidity will be much more relevant once MCD is deployed on them, but also currently that liquidity is not completely irrelevant, but we generally do not consider it directly, because it can not be used in flash loan transactions, and there can be a time delay when withdrawing assets back to L1. As a rule of thumb, we aim for the asset to provide 20-30m dai or more. Now obviously, there are assets currently in the protocol which have much less than that, but at the time of onboarding, it was expected that demand would be larger as it actually turned out to be and conditions were different. As a consequence we had to offboard various assets which many consider as blue chips in the space, such as AAVE, COMP, ZRX, BAT, BAL, which generally have $1b+ market caps. Even if we assume, that half of current rETH would be used as collateral (which is considered a maximum exposure we want to have towards one specific asset) with a healthy debt weighted collateral ratio of 250% (current state of Lido stETH vaults), we would come to 27m dai issued. This would be acceptable, but it is very unlikely that half of all rETH would be used in Maker. Assuming the above, this means we potentially have to liquidate more than 10k+ tokens in the case of a large market crash. Such an event would produce large price slippage on ETH itself, due to all the unwinding and liquidations in various lending protocols, so the rETH/ETH slippage should be as small as possible and is added on top of the ETH slippage. That said, it is fair to say that current liquidity is not sufficient, and considering that we are dealing with ETH, the rETH/ETH should really be minimal. Specific number for liquidity is relative to various conditions in the markets, Maker system, Ethereum in general and will change during time. For example, if transacting on Ethereum becomes much cheaper than it is today, we would have no problems with much lower issued debt from collaterals. Because of this I don\u2019t want to state a specific number which can be used as a condition, before such guidelines are officially issued by MakerDAO, but based on the hypothetical example above and current conditions, we (risk CU) would likely be comfortable with 10k+ ETH or equivalent liquidity to start with the asset, with the assumption that the ecosystem will grow and liquidity increases over time.

It is also the oldest ETH staking project and it\u2019s team is extremely Ethereum aligned. I understand the limited liquidity may lead to some hesitancy in supporting rETH at this time, but it is rapidly growing. If we are slow with implementation, by the time they have higher liquidity that it minimizes concerns, rETH holders will likely find have found homes in on other DeFi protocols and be difficult to re-capture. I believe for a high quality, fully decentralized, ETH yield bearing asset such as rETH, it is important for MakerDAO to be more risk tolerant and onboard it ASAP. ",

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. renDOGE is a tokenized representation of DOGE on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an ERC20, and backed 1:1 with real DOGE locked in RenVM, a decentralized custodian. It is redeemable at any time for real DOGE. RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that provides ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC. What makes RenVM unique is that it does all key management and rotation using its sMPC based protocol that the team has pioneered. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs (e.g. ECDSA private keys) are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it. This allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets, making it possible to mint or burn tokenized representations of these assets on external blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized manner.  3. Provide a brief history of the project.  Q1 2018 - Decentralized Darkpools Ren (Republic Protocol at the time) sold out a $35mm ICO. The original mandate was to build darkpools for digital assets - a way to prevent front-running and price slippage by trading large amounts in a private, decentralized manner. This idea placed the project in the \u2018interface\u2019 layer of the stack. Rather than just building a single darkpool,  the intention was to provide infrastructure for third parties to build multiple dark pools, pooling liquidity and providing a better end-user experience. RenEx and SwapperD were built and delivered (Q4 2018)  Q1 2019 - Republic Protocol Evolves to Ren Ren team realizes that what they have built applies to much more than Darkpools, pivots down the stack to an \u2018interoperability (+ privacy) protocol\u2019 and RenVM is born. Rather than operating a single darkpool, or allowing multiple dark pools to build and connect, the protocol will now provide key interoperability infrastructure for DEXs, OTC desks, loan & leverage platforms, liquidity pools, NFTs, dApps, etc.  Q3 2019 - Formal RenVM Testnet: August 2019 - Present  This is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. The RenVM Mainnet Rollout Plan articulates the steps for testing and gradual decentralization of the protocol. Follows the recommendation of Progressive Decentralization from Andreessen Horowitz. (Published September 2019)  Q4 2019 - RenVM Chaosnet | RenVM Mainnet Unaudited  Formal RenVM Chaosnet: November 2019 - Present The sole purpose of this was to put RenVM Mainnet through as many stress tests as possible prior to Mainnet release. The Ren team believes this prudent approach (a 6 month testing period) to RenVM\u2019s security (in addition to formal verification from security auditors) has been crucial for its robustness and subsequent success. Chaosnet is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. (Published November 2019)  Q2 2020 - RenVM Mainnet | Subzero  RenVM Mainnet is released May 27th, 2020. RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats)  Q3 2020 - Open-Sourcing RZL MPC  One of the most important technical goals for the project is getting to a stage where the team is comfortable open-sourcing the implementation of the RZL MPC algorithm. Over the last month, the Ren dev team has begun decoupling the MPC implementation from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to iterate, test, and understand. As a part of this, they have been implementing new optimizations, building multiple versions of some parts of the codebase to gain even more confidence in its correctness, and moving to a new design centered around easy-to-understand state machines. All of this comes together to make a codebase that is simpler, safer, faster, and easier for everyone to test/review/audit. An overview of this logic, can be found here. The Ren team has engaged with several auditing teams to review these changes, and once they are completed, will be ready to make the codebase available under the GNU GPL v3 license. This is planned for release by the end of Q3 2020, depending on the timeframes of these audits.  4.

Link to any active communities relating to your project. Telegram Twitter Reddit Medium  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? renDOGE is a one for one representation of DOGE on Ethereum via RenVM. As an ERC20, it is/can be utilized in a variety of capacities within the DeFi ecosystem; lending, leveraging, trading, etc.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No, decentralized protocol  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Individuals can acquire renDOGE by minting it with real DOGE via OpenDAO. The same minting process can be achieved on other 3rd party platforms who choose to integrate RenVM (as its SDKs are permissionless). Further, renDOGE is an ERC20 and can be found throughout the DeFi AMM ecosystem.  10. Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A  11. Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A  12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Dogecoin has been in existence for seven years, hence it is listed on many centralized exchanges already supported by setzer including Binance, OKEx & Karken.

MakerDAO ultimately should have ALL collaterals. The problem is that embarking new collaterals is costly (risks evaluations, oracles, smart-contracts, etc), so we need to prioritise the choices. But, in principle, if they bring value (fees), why not? Regarding the \u201cmanipulated\u201d (and therefore risky): this can be handled by the several parameters of a collateral (SF, max col. ratio, etc). Example: If Dogecoin holders are willing to pay 25% SF (just a crazy example) and accept a max col. ratio of 250% (another crazy example), then why not? ",
