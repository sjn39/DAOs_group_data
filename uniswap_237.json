            "body": "Post: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-community-governance-process-changes/19718\n\n~~~\nOn November 21st, we posted a Request for Comment 5 on a series of proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process. Thank you to everyone who has provided their comments! Based on community feedback and discussion, we are making some adjustments to our proposal. We will keep this proposal outstanding until next Wednesday December 14th, at which point we will post a Snapshot poll on the changes.\n\nThe changes to the RFC based on feedback are as follows:\n\nRevisions and updates to RFC\n\nIncrease the new \u201cRequest for Comment\u201d process to be a minimum of 7 days rather than our originally proposed 3 days. We agree with Alana Levin 2, GFX Labs 1, and others that a minimum of 1 week ensures that the community will have adequate time to digest each proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback.\nIncrease the quorum for the new Temperature Check, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to 10M UNI rather than the originally proposed 5M UNI. As pointed out by Deven Matthews 1 from Blockchain at Berkeley, 37 delegates meet the 2.5mm threshold \u2013 proposers would only need to garner support from 2 of these delegates to move to the last governance vote with a 5M quorum. Increasing quorum to 10M UNI increases the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support.\nWe highlight two suggestion from Toby from Other Internet to 1) standardize Snapshot language, particularly by formalizing the use of \u201cNo change\u201d rather than other more biased language in Snapshot polls, and 2) reach out to popular governance platforms where the governance process is listed to update it, if the vote passes.\nWe are now planning to post a Snapshot Poll to vote on Wednesday, December 14th. The voting parameters will be 7 days and a 40M UNI quorum.\nIn addition to the above changes, we also pose the following question to the community. We originally proposed that changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process be votes on through an off-chain vote on Snapshot. GFX Labs 1 brought up the point that custodians do not allow voting off-chain - which means many voters may not be able to participate in those votes. Should these changes be voted on on- or off-chain? Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine!\n\nBelow, we provide an updated version of our original post.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOne of the goals of the Uniswap Foundation 1 is to reduce the amount of friction in the community governance process. In that spirit, today we are proposing changes to that process to improve its efficiency and efficacy.\n\nWe propose the following changes to the community governance process:\n\nRemove the first off-chain Snapshot poll, and replace it with a \u201cRequest for Comment\u201d post. The first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. We also believe two off-chain votes introduces unnecessary friction.\nIncrease quorum for the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll in the second phase to 10M UNI. The purpose of this off-chain vote is to gauge community sentiment prior to the governance vote. We believe the 10 million UNI quorum will act as a better signal than the lower quorum requirements in the current process.\nWe also propose to formalize a process for future changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process, like the changes discussed in this proposal. As mentioned above, we are now welcoming feedback from the community on whether these changes should be voted on through an on- or off-chain vote. If you keep your UNI at a custodian, opine below!\nSummary\n\nUniswap\u2019s governance process is a core input to the community\u2019s ability to steward its ongoing maintenance and growth in a fair and transparent manner. The design of the process should optimize for the dissemination of information throughout the community, for thoughtful iterations on proposals, and for signaling from the community prior to on-chain votes. While the governance process put in place today has, for the most part, been successful in achieving those goals, we believe improvements can be made to reduce overhead and to enhance off-chain signaling prior to the final governance vote.\n\nThese process enhancements were previously discussed in the forum here, but the simplifications were never implemented. We have decided to bring them back with minor changes.\n\nBelow we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change.\n\n\n1297\u00d7842 65.2 KB\nCurrent Process\n\nA detailed outline of the current process can be found here 1.\n\nTemperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 25K UNI yes-vote threshold.\nConsensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 50K UNI yes-vote threshold.\nGovernance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address.\nProposed changes to community governance process\n\nPhase 1: Request for Comment\n\nRename: Temperature Check \u2192 Request for Comment\nRemoval of Snapshot off-chain vote requirement\nA minimum of 7 days before moving forward\nWe believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions \u2013 and not require going through the friction of one of two off-chain votes. The RFC Phase should last for at least 7 days to give the community ample time to formulate opinions on the proposal and provide feedback.\n\nPhase 2: Temperature Check\n\nIncrease the required quorum from 50K to 10M UNI\nFor this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing the Snapshot poll yes-vote threshold to 10 million UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final phase, while being low enough for higher quality proposals to garner enough support and move on to the final phase.\n\nAs suggested by Toby, we also strongly suggest the standard usage of a \u201cNo change\u201d option in these Snapshot polls.\n\nPhase 3: On-chain Governance Vote\n\nNo changes\nProposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process\n\nAs mentioned above, we are looking for more community feedback on this topic\n\nIn her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states \u201cOn-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes.\u201d An on-chain vote is unnecessary and requires users to pay gas, so should not be required for off-chain process changes. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy. We thus originally proposed that changes to off-chain processes be voted on through off-chain votes on Snapshot with a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum (original RFC here 5).\n\nHowever, GFX Labs 1 made the point that custodians do not allow UNI holders to vote off-chain, which may mean some UNI is precluded from voting on those changes. We would like more community feedback on whether these kinds of changes should be voted on on- or off-chain. Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine!\n\nConclusion and Next Steps\n\nIf no new serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll on Wednesday, December 14th for the community to vote on these changes. If the Snapshot receives a quorum of 40M UNI votes, the community is indicating they are in favor of these changes.\n\nThe UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and work with other platforms where the Uniswap governance process is defined to make updates as well.",

Below we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change.  Group 1 (1)1729\u00d71138 87.1 KB   Current Process  A detailed outline of the current process can be found here.   Temperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll with a 25k UNI quorum.   Consensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll with a 50k UNI quorum.   Governance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote, tied to on-chain executable code, is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address, and there is a 40M UNI quorum requirement.    Proposed changes to community governance process  Phase 1: Request for Comment  Rename: Temperature Check \u2192 Request for Comment Removal of Snapshot off-chain vote A minimum of 3 days before moving forward  We believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. The RFC Phase should last for at least 3 days so the proposers can gather adequate feedback to take into account for the next iteration of the proposal. We are also removing the friction of two off-chain votes. Phase 2: Temperature Check  Rename: Consensus Check \u2192 Temperature Check Increase the required quorum from 50k to 5M UNI  For this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing quorum to 5M UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final on-chain vote, while not creating additional friction. Phase 3: On-chain Governance Vote  No changes   Proposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process  In her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states \u201cOn-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes.\u201d We agree with this. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for off-chain process changes to have legitimacy. Thus, we propose a formalized process \u2013 intended to signal community support and acceptance \u2013 to change these off-chain components in the future. Specifically, we propose an off-chain vote with the same parameters of the final governance vote. Right now, that is a 7 day vote period and 40M UNI quorum. These are the parameters we plan to use to pass all of the proposed changes in this proposal.  Conclusion and Next Steps  We welcome all feedback from the community on these proposed changes, and will incorporate feedback into the proposal where sentiment is strong. If no serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll in 3 weeks, on Monday, December 12th for the community to vote on these changes. This vote will last for 7 days and require a quorum of 40M UNI votes. If the vote passes, the UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and elsewhere. ",

Switching the temperature check to a 3-day RFC sounds like a good improvement. It might be nice to make that a week instead; however, we don\u2019t see a reason to delay the Snapshot Poll if the proposer believes they can rally the votes. We do think it is worth considering to increase the Snapshot further than the proposed 5m. As @devenmatthews pointed out, 37 wallets meet the 2.5mm threshold. With that in mind, maybe we should set the quorum to 10m, or more? Ultimately it isn\u2019t super important since the poll is not codified and is only socially enforced. As for the second point regarding a formalized off-chain governance process. Snapshot voting should not be used for decision-making because a large amount of UNI cannot participate in Snapshot due to custody providers inability to vote off-chain. All governance decisions should be decided on-chain. ",

Reaching quorum would then indicate that the proposal is either an absolute home run or that the proposer has done the leg work to get it in front of enough delegates to get buy-in from the community. 10m seems a reasonable number. I wanted to raise one more item here. While in general I\u2019d like to avoid the scenario where the DAO must decide the best option out of several, it\u2019s reasonable to think that we\u2019ll run up against it at some point. Given a recent personal run-in with ranked-choice voting, I strongly believe that it\u2019s a superior method to first past the post voting (despite having lost the vote in question!). That said, it\u2019s not super intuitive to understand the implications of your vote in RCV and I\u2019d like to avoid a situation where we\u2019re explaining it to stakeholders while a vote is happening. It\u2019s not easy to envision a scenario where we\u2019re making such a choice given the DAO\u2019s current structural constraints, but I do think it\u2019s worth there being a bullet point in both the Phase 2: Temperature check section and the Proposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process section that indicate that in the event of a choice between several options, RCV will be the methodology used.

Framing of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d votes could use particular attention (here are three different  polls  which each have different phrasings for yes and no votes \u2014 some do not show up in the UI properly). Using \u201cno change\u201d as a standard for no votes, at the very least, would be a reasonable starting place.  Still think that this would be useful language to add to a governance process update. The current process has been enshrined in several third party apps like Boardroom. We\u2019ll need to make a list of these projects and reach out to ensure the process documentation is correctly updated. Lastly, not opposed to a 5 day RFC minimum. Not opposed to increased quorum.

                    "content": "Updates to original RFC, which can be found here On November 21st, we posted a Request for Comment on a series of proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process. Thank you to everyone who has provided their comments! Based on community feedback and discussion, we are making some adjustments to our proposal. We will keep this proposal outstanding until next Wednesday December 14th, at which point we will post a Snapshot poll on the changes. The changes to the RFC based on feedback are as follows: Revisions and updates to RFC   Increase the new \u201cRequest for Comment\u201d process to be a minimum of 7 days rather than our originally proposed 3 days. We agree with Alana Levin, GFX Labs, and others that a minimum of 1 week ensures that the community will have adequate time to digest each proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback.  Increase the quorum for the new Temperature Check, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to 10M UNI rather than the originally proposed 5M UNI. As pointed out by Deven Matthews from Blockchain at Berkeley, 37 delegates meet the 2.5mm threshold \u2013 proposers would only need to garner support from 2 of these delegates to move to the last governance vote with a 5M quorum. Increasing quorum to 10M UNI increases the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support.  We highlight two suggestion from Toby from Other Internet to 1) standardize Snapshot language, particularly by formalizing the use of \u201cNo change\u201d rather than other more biased language in Snapshot polls, and 2) reach out to popular governance platforms where the governance process is listed to update it, if the vote passes. We are now planning to post a Snapshot Poll to vote on Wednesday, December 14th. The voting parameters will be 7 days and a 40M UNI quorum.  In addition to the above changes, we also pose the following question to the community. We originally proposed that changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process be votes on through an off-chain vote on Snapshot. GFX Labs brought up the point that custodians do not allow voting off-chain - which means many voters may not be able to participate in those votes. Should these changes be voted on on- or off-chain? Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Below, we provide an updated version of our original post. TL;DR   One of the goals of the Uniswap Foundation is to reduce the amount of friction in the community governance process. In that spirit, today we are proposing changes to that process to improve its efficiency and efficacy.   We propose the following changes to the community governance process:     Remove the first off-chain Snapshot poll, and replace it with a \u201cRequest for Comment\u201d post. The first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. We also believe two off-chain votes introduces unnecessary friction.  Increase quorum for the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll in the second phase to 10M UNI. The purpose of this off-chain vote is to gauge community sentiment prior to the governance vote. We believe the 10 million UNI quorum will act as a better signal than the lower quorum requirements in the current process.   We also propose to formalize a process for future changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process, like the changes discussed in this proposal. As mentioned above, we are now welcoming feedback from the community on whether these changes should be voted on through an on- or off-chain vote. If you keep your UNI at a custodian, opine below!  Summary Uniswap\u2019s governance process is a core input to the community\u2019s ability to steward its ongoing maintenance and growth in a fair and transparent manner. The design of the process should optimize for the dissemination of information throughout the community, for thoughtful iterations on proposals, and for signaling from the community prior to on-chain votes. While the governance process put in place today has, for the most part, been successful in achieving those goals, we believe improvements can be made to reduce overhead and to enhance off-chain signaling prior to the final governance vote. These process enhancements were previously discussed in the forum here, but the simplifications were never implemented. We have decided to bring them back with minor changes. Below we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change.  1297\u00d7842 65.2 KB  Current Process A detailed outline of the current process can be found here.   Temperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 25K UNI yes-vote threshold.  Consensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 50K UNI yes-vote threshold.  Governance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address.  Proposed changes to community governance process Phase 1: Request for Comment  Rename: Temperature Check \u2192 Request for Comment Removal of Snapshot off-chain vote requirement A minimum of 7 days before moving forward  We believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions \u2013 and not require going through the friction of one of two off-chain votes. The RFC Phase should last for at least 7 days to give the community ample time to formulate opinions on the proposal and provide feedback. Phase 2: Temperature Check  Increase the required quorum from 50K to 10M UNI  For this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing the Snapshot poll yes-vote threshold to 10 million UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final phase, while being low enough for higher quality proposals to garner enough support and move on to the final phase. As suggested by Toby, we also strongly suggest the standard usage of a \u201cNo change\u201d option in these Snapshot polls. Phase 3: On-chain Governance Vote  No changes  Proposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process As mentioned above, we are looking for more community feedback on this topic In her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states \u201cOn-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes.\u201d An on-chain vote is unnecessary and requires users to pay gas, so should not be required for off-chain process changes. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy. We thus originally proposed that changes to off-chain processes be voted on through off-chain votes on Snapshot with a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum (original RFC here). However, GFX Labs made the point that custodians do not allow UNI holders to vote off-chain, which may mean some UNI is precluded from voting on those changes. We would like more community feedback on whether these kinds of changes should be voted on on- or off-chain. Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine! Conclusion and Next Steps If no new serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll on Wednesday, December 14th for the community to vote on these changes. If the Snapshot receives a quorum of 40M UNI votes, the community is indicating they are in favor of these changes. The UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and work with other platforms where the Uniswap governance process is defined to make updates as well. ",

However, because the polling is off-chain, it isn\u2019t a required step of the governance process and is only socially enforced. For example, GFX Labs could instantly make an on-chain governance proposal, and so long as it reached the required 40m votes in favor, it would execute. We wouldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s not socially acceptable, and we don\u2019t want to damage our reputation, but it\u2019s best to unambiguously codify what are and are not rules when possible. Additionally, we\u2019re aware of several funds that utilize custodians and thus cannot participate in off-chain votes such as Snapshot. In conversation with the Foundation, we proposed the idea of bringing polling on-chain, making polling a requirement to the governance process, and enabling all parties to participate in votes. Effectively, this would be a junior and senior governance structure. The junior governor would have its own proposal requirements and could feature a lower proposal threshold and quorum threshold. Upon success, the proposal could be passed onto the senior governor, likely requiring a higher quorum threshold to be executed. In addition to the benefits already listed above, there would be a third primary benefit. This setup could be used to lower the proposal threshold significantly, making governance more accessible, while maintaining the security of the DAO. For example, the proposal threshold for the junior governor contract could be set to 100k and have a quorum of 10m. Improving upon the existing 2.5m threshold. However, only a proposal that achieves a 10m quorum would proceed to the senior governor, where the execution would occur if it reached the full 40m. For those who are familiar with Community Autonomous Proposals (CAPs), which allow individuals without the necessary votes to make miniature-like proposals, this system would be a massive improvement. CAPs were unsuccessful at gaining traction because they require votes to be delegated, which is unrealistic when votes cannot be relegated. If this is something voters are interested in seeing, we could formalize the structure and apply for a grant to develop and implement the new smart contracts. ",

For instance, the ability to go straight to an on-chain proposal can cut down on time, and if it passes, what would be the problem with there being no prior poll?  It kind of seems to add more complexity as well as potentially more surface area for attacks. ",

                    "content": "To best answer this question, lets clarify the purpose of polling in the governance process. Plenty of DAOs don\u2019t utilize polling and function perfectly fine. When Uniswap Labs launched UNI and introduced the DAO they proposed a governance framework that consisted of a forum post, temperature check, consensus check, and on-chain vote.  Only the final step is functionally important to the DAO; the first three exist to give the proposer a framework to gather support and feedback on their proposal. The framework allows forum posts to start as ideas and progress into implementation. The framework does not prevent proposers from creating on-chain proposals which skip the traditional steps. If UNI holders want to adjust the framework to guarantee voters have time to review proposals before they progress to an implementation vote, then the protocol should codify the requirement on-chain. In addition to guaranteeing time to review the proposal before implementation, there are two other benefits. First, by implementing the proposed junior governor setup, the number of possible proposers could increase significantly because it effectively lowers the proposal threshold while maintaining the same quorum requirement. Second, it doesn\u2019t put the protocol and its voters in the position of being reliant on Snapshot. ",
