                    "content": "Overview: Over the past month we have seen the burn kick back into action. This has given us some data as to the efficiency of the burn auctions and how the system handles burns over some time. Examining the data it is shown that there is some inefficiencies when it comes to how we buy back MKR. For the auctions in November/December 2021 the average price of bought MKR was 3,62% over market price and the median was 3,47%. Due to a few outliers the median seems to give the more correct picture. The auctions are by design meant to go over market to compensate keepers for gas cost and the price risk they face by locking in their MKR in a 30 min window. This is achieved by having a minimum bid increase (beg) of 4%. Comparing this to the data we can see that most auctions are rewarding the keepers close to the current beg. There might be room to change the level of this reward. One way to do so is to lower the beg. Lowering the beg makes it less attractive to take part in auctions due to gas cost. To compensate we can increase lot size which makes auctions more gas efficient. Lowering the beg was also mentioned as a possible future change in this signal request Proposed Changes I would propose to lower the beg to retain more value to be burned. In order to offset some of the disadvantage I would at the same time propose to increase the lot size. Expected pros and cons of decreasing the beg: Pros:  More value retained from the auctions to be burned More granularity in bids  Cons:  Greater risk and less reward to take part in auctions Risk of auctions having to run multiple times due to lack of kick     Change the beg parameter  2,5% (-1,5%) 3,0% (-1,0%) 3,5% (-0,5%) No change Abstain     0 voters     Expected pros and cons of increasing the bump Pros:  More gas efficient which makes auctions more attractive for keepers Less auctions overall makes them easier to track and could increase competition for them  Cons:  Higher lot raises the bar for individual actors to participate Fewer overall auctions could lead to less monitoring available auctions     Change lot to  40.000 DAI (+10.000) 50.000 DAI (+20.000) 60.000 DAI (+30.000) 75.000 DAI (+45.000) No change Abstain     0 voters     Next steps This poll will close on 2021-12-30T23:00:00Z.

It hurts those auctions are running so inefficient and are prone to really large discounts by the current mechanics on multiple running flaps. To you points  The costs to participate (gas for the auction, recycling the DAI to MKR) are already quite high and  the 30 minute ttl (which was already higher!) makes it necessary to provide quite a big discount. I think lowering the beg is risky, we might loose keepers by doing so and we already don\u2019t have a lot In the current situation I think raising the bump makes sense. Always a bit sad as it locks out small participants, but it will make the auctions a bit more efficient  ",

As long as there is profit to be made, economic actors will be there to pick up. I also think there is a fundamental difference between the burn auctions and the liquidation auctions in that there isn\u2019t really a big downside to failed auctions. As long as it\u2019s not a permanent failure, a failed auction merely means a delayed auction.

                    "content": "@makerburn I\u2019m afraid I disagree completely with many of the assumptions that form the basis of your argument.  As @ultraschuppi points out, in your estimates of profitability you\u2019ve forgotten about the leg that takes the keeper from DAI back to MKR\u2026 they don\u2019t just accumulate it infinitely and never sell it  . That\u2019s a critical omission because hedging is the most important and usually the most expensive part - gas cost (sometimes very substantial) + 0.3% uniswap fee + market impact of the trade depending on its size (again, often very substantial depending on liquidity). Furthermore, this expense is sometimes DUPLICATED on the occasions when a keeper gets outbid due to the market moving, because they then have to unwind the trade they just did and sell the MKR they just bought back into DAI in order to not have any risk on. Here is a typical example of a keeper using this strategy - buying MKR and kicking an auction in one transaction. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9a961115be5ef39c5d9c3498e4d64433e5fde6073c4bd59d7923dd60ba8ceb9f As you can see that alone already costs 800 dollars. But depending on the keeper this obviously varies and is often not visible, as it\u2019s done in separate transactions.  Once you factor all that in, your figure of 2.3% becomes not even 1%. Reducing the beg from 4% to 3% would make it 0, or negative. You don\u2019t have to take my word for this however, because\u2026  There is at this point essentially only 1 regular keeper. That\u2019s because a couple of the entries in your list of keepers are actually the same keeper. For example, 0x008C\u2026 and 0x0017\u2026 call the same contract. Same goes for 0xa816\u2026 and 0x489E\u2026 . So basically, there are only 3 people that have ever kicked more than 1 auction. Of them, one stopped kicking regularly a week ago, and the other stopped kicking regularly a month ago. Clearly this would not have happened if you were correct in your assertion that flaps are highly profitable.  This then leads to the situation we had on the 4th of December, where some auctions went for 30% offside precisely BECAUSE there are not enough interested keepers with eyes permanently on this market. So basically, issues are arising because the role of keeper is already too unattractive as a function of the effort and market risk required, yet astoundingly people on this forum are permanently convinced that the way to fix them is to make it EVEN LESS attractive. On this note, for completeness I should add that, 3) it is a complete fallacy that increasing the bump to 50k would be positive for keepers. The average keeper already faces a very unattractive ratio of variance to edge - making just 100 or 200 dollars on average on the auctions they win, yet standing to lose 1k or more on the (admittedly rarer) ones where the market goes against them, in which case they lose either directly if they have risk on, or through gas fees if another participant dimes them and their kick was for nothing. (Because as I explained on several posts and community calls in the past, there are far more participants willing to be parasitic and dime a keeper, than there are willing to risk their own money and kick. So no surprise there is not much interest on the keeper front). Increasing the size of a single auction would simply make this ratio even more stressful. And yes there would indeed be economies of scale on gas, but as mentioned in point 1) this would be easily offset by the less efficient hedging of such a large clip of MKR, which is not at all liquid. So increasing bump and decreasing beg is NOT a balanced action, it would in fact be more of a double whammy for keepers. More risk for less edge  I don\u2019t deliberately set out to come across combative. Yes it IS tiring that we are discussing the same misconceptions from scratch for like the 4th time in the last couple of years. But that\u2019s part and parcel of governance in a DAO. I also don\u2019t mind that we are in a situation where important decisions could be pushed by people that have never tried to participate in a flap auction, yet set out to analyse them, and therefore may end up doing more harm than good despite meaning well. Again, that is part and parcel. What IS frustrating though, is that as I say I remember being on a community call over a year ago now and talking about this exact topic. Back then I was still a semi regular keeper, and I warned that the incentives of the system were misaligned in such a way that the sweet spot for a keeper to be profitable was vanishingly small, and we would eventually lose most keepers. It is therefore very frustrating that this is exactly what has come to pass, yet people are STILL discussing measures that will make the situation worse still. To finish on a more positive note\u2026 where I agree with everyone in this thread, is that the solution is LIQ2. LIQ2 will address the issue at its root, in a way that endless tinkering with the current parameters never will. ",

As one of the people who did not have the same level of exposure to past discussions of the same type your post has really helped me see a different perspective. I fear with the rapid developments in crypto we\u2019re still going to be discussing some topics over again as time marches on. Hopefully we can teach and guide each other as a community. My main takeaway from this discussion is that the introduction of Liq2.0 for the burn auctions should be the priority. With current parameters we stand to burn quite a bit of MKR and should they improve we\u2019re likely to burn even more. It seems even more urgent given that so much apparently hinges on a single keeper. That being said I want to offer some counter arguments when it comes to the lack of keepers. In regards to your point 1.; that describes one possible strategy. It is still possible to do a trade without the hedge in the case where an actor wants to do a permanent switch from MKR to DAI or from MKR to another asset. This ties in that there is no urgency as such for MakerDAO to conclude the burn auctions as opposed to the liquidation auctions. This should provide at least a little market incentive to participate in auctions as an alternative to do straight up swaps on other platforms. In regards to point 2.; Another factor to consider is that burn auctions have been inactive for a long time and just recently got started with some regularity. Setting up and monitoring is another cost that comes into play. This also creates a barrier of entry for other actors as they need to be able to compete to get to kick. With auctions at 30k and the dust limit of ETH-B vaults at 40k and ETH-A vaults at 15k, there should be a fair amount of overlap between vault holders and actors with the financial capacity to partake in the auctions, so it is possible there are other reasons than profitability holding back the availability of keepers.

All regular keepers that are fully decentralised have left this market as they are unable to extract a worthwhile profit. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to explain why this is a bad situation. Not only is using centralised exchanges more time consuming, higher risk, more capital intensive and just generally higher barrier to entry than doing everything on chain, which means our pool of potential keepers drastically shrinks\u2026 it\u2019s also just generally a poorer alignment with our community, since obviously one would expect a MKR user to be both happier and more competent hedging their risk on chain. Is this what we wanted to achieve ? (For the avoidance of vagueness or argument, I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s impossible to kick auctions and make a profit hedging purely on dexes.

If a person is able to get more return on those things from other opportunities in DeFi, they won\u2019t want to be a flap keeper.

Just look how handsomely we pay our developers, oracles, etc. Providing reliable, orderly participation in auctions should be viewed as a service, and therefore a legitimate expense on the part of the DAO, to be paid at the market rate. That\u2019s why we call them \u2018keepers\u2019 and not \u2018arbitrage bots\u2019 or something more negative/extractive. However much the current (lest we forget, right now, the one and only) keeper is actually making after costs etc. appears to be, for better or worse, not a single cent more than that market rate.

But I think in most people\u2019s experience, every time we get a large number of auctions in parallel, they\u2019re not orderly. That essentially is what this thread boils down to - we\u2019re comparing 2 different types of risk. It\u2019s apples and oranges, there will never be a perfectly scientific method to compare them. One is the risk, brought up by the OP, that we are giving away too much money by having a beg that is too generous. The downside of having a beg that is 1% higher than necessary is perfectly quantifiable and fixed - 300 dollars times the number of auctions. The other, precisely as @Jiecut said, is about tail risk. That one isn\u2019t easy to quantify. It\u2019s very hard to state a probability of a black swan event in crypto prices, it\u2019s very hard to model how many vaults will be able to save themselves in such an event (given potential state of the network and everything else), it\u2019s very hard to predict how keepers will behave in such an event. But it\u2019s pretty obvious it\u2019s incredibly easy to see how such an event could cost millions, given it only takes 33 auctions to go for zero to cost 1m. (And to state the other obvious thing, when any professional organisation makes provisions for this type of risk, they leave big margin for error. They don\u2019t just do estimated chance of event * estimated cost of event and then say \u2018well that\u2019s that covered\u2019). Maker, of course, DOES take these provisions very seriously, hence its conservative policy with constant increases of the surplus buffer, which I absolutely support. However, there is another measure that can improve the safety of the protocol in addition to a huge buffer, and that is having a healthy and thriving ecosystem of keepers. A measure which, I should add, not only has the advantage of being much cheaper, but also being preventative rather than remedial. So yeah, I always find it confusing how people are happy to plough tens of millions into the surplus buffer, yet flinch at the thought of a number several orders of magnitude smaller than that heaven forbid going to a keeper somewhere. As it stands our flap keeper ecosystem is already anything but healthy, it hasn\u2019t been since the very start, yet we are once again discussing how to make it even less healthy in the name of saving 1% on an auction. @Zarevok I don\u2019t know how you understood my last post to mean that a keeper using a centralised exchange is a bad thing, because that\u2019s clearly not what I said. I said that centralised keepers being dominant is a SIGN of an auction setup offering too little edge, which has caused decentralised keepers to leave the game, because their arbitrage bots aren\u2019t efficient enough to compete with centralised hedging for the very thin margins on offer. No one is going to spend time and effort running and fine tuning a bot if it never trades, they will just turn it off and move on to another market, hence we end up losing many pairs of eyes that would otherwise be on this market 24/7. Hence I said \u2018our pool of potential keepers shrinks\u2019. If you have many regular keepers, in a chaotic market they can all watch each other, and will compete with each other and drive the price down. By contrast, if you have few regular keepers, in a chaotic market not only are they under no pressure to be competitive, they will ACTIVELY try to take liberties because they know they can (and because it\u2019s probably their only good chance to make some decent money) - exactly as we saw on the 4th of Dec.

I don\u2019t necessarily speak for everyone on the team, but I wanted to give my own opinions here as someone who has been with Maker for over 2.5 years (including Black Thursday), wrote the initial implementation of Liq 2.0, and has been observing Flap auctions and these governance discussions for some time. My thoughts as a PECU member: I strongly agree with the points made by @dmitri.z . Obsessing over a few % slippage on Flap auctions is counterproductive. The dearth of Keepers is a real concern. If governance is committed to continuing to burn MKR at some level in the short-to-medium term, we must prioritize moving surplus auctions to a Dutch auction mechanism like the collateral auctions to lower barriers to participation (or explore other mechanisms, like the TWAMM designed by Paradigm\u2019s researchers). My personal thoughts as an MKR holder/DAO member: burning is currently a poor use of capital. Serious and existential questions face the protocol like how to overcome the scaling challenges of decentralized blockchains, how to safely onboard RWAs, how to integrate DAI into the real economy beyond the circularity of DeFi farming, making DAO governance more effective and efficient, and ensuring we don\u2019t become victims of mis-informed regulation. Besides all of that, we need to be ready for the next big crypto crash\u2013our Risk team has provided what I think is excellent guidance on that front. Survival and growth should both come before direct enrichment of token holders at this stage. BUT, if we\u2019re going to burn, we should definitely do it more robustly, per my professional opinions above. ",
