The organizational identity of Gitcoin is changing - given the language and championing around the regen movement, it\u2019s clear that a renewed focus on impact is emerging. Are we signaling our commitment to being a forward-thinking impact-driven organization through our visual representation, the visual assets we use, our brand aesthetic? Is there room to broaden the visual identity of Gitcoin as a new overall brand identity (i.e., values, focus, vision) emerges? Moreover, in the past months, we have seen inconsistency in Gitcoin\u2019s external-facing branding. How we represent our products is incongruent. For example, the way we visually represent grants rounds and the graphics that we use to promote events is completely different. In MMM\u2019s work to update the brand guide, we have reached a point where we now have questions on what next steps to take in how we represent ourselves as an org. Naturally, we think that this should be a discussion through the community. This leaves us with the question: How can we create a visual brand that is streamlined and cohesive? We believe it is important for Gitcoin to consider this question as we work to be industry leaders and galvanizers in Web3. Our shared mission, our org culture, our voice, is best signaled with a consistent aesthetic. Our relationships to external stakeholders, our growth efforts, our organization\u2019s focus (internal and external) will be supported by a consistent aesthetic. In order to move this effort forward, we propose the creation of a brand council to meet and workshop on some of the following topics: -Pulse check on current branding -Emerging themes & brand alignment/expansion -Creating and enforcing a point of truth for visual assets at Gitcoin @Viriya & @seedphrase  MMM Workstream  ",

While they\u2019re all unique and beautiful in their own right, it\u2019s obvious there is a brand cohesiveness missing. There are likely more examples in language as well - these are less obvious but for instance: conversations around fighting Molach & emphasizing coordination seem to be less prevalent lately. Public goods and regen themes like green pilling & human thriving have been more prominent. My wonderings: I wonder how/if this reflects an evolution of focus within the DAO? Or is it just a trend? I wonder how/if this reflects a lack of cohesive DAO identity? (see image below) I wonder if folks think visual cohesiveness is important?  If not, how will we maintain an overall brand cohesiveness (beyond just visual brand but also our identity as a DAO) despite a lack of visual signal of this? If so, how might we align, create and govern cohesion?   BrandIdentiy1920\u00d71237 51.8 KB  ",

As we tackle that question, perhaps we could also consider how we can build a brand that supports our mission & impact - And also that builds GitcoinDAO\u2019s legitimacy. Being more cohesive may be one way to get there, but it may not be the biggest opportunity. These are just a few thoughts - to be super clear going forward while I\u2019m happy to provide my thoughts on future concepts/direction , the Gitcoin brand identity is very much in your (the DAO\u2019s & MMM\u2019s!) hands to steward! Oh and btw, @seedphrase and i chatted a bit about Solarpunk vs Lunarpunk vs Quadratic Lands at the retreat.  IMHO they are narratively compatible (and visually complementary)\u2026 My Ethereum is solarpunk deck has some examples of how I think these interweave, but I\u2019ll just briefly repeat here:   Solarpunk - a world where our economic system is focused on sustainability/harmony & we\u2019ve solved our contemporary coordination challenges  Lunarpunk - same definition as solarpunk, but dark mode/nighttime (and also more focused on privacy)  Quadratic lands - a world in which the laws of economics have been rewritten to support the commons/public goods (visually the same as lunarpunk)  ",
