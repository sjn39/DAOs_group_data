For all attackers they go into detail on exactly how it was determined they were an attacker, which I mean is actually very morally important. There lists are freely available on github, and I mean if you want you can reward Hop users/Sybil finders for the work like Hop has done if you don\u2019t just want to rip off their list. I was reading threw all of there Sybil attack notes and it did seem that a great many if not most were geared at optimism and arbitrum. Its always good when alot of work is already done for you. Here is a ling to their github: Issues \u00b7 hop-protocol/hop-airdrop \u00b7 GitHub ",
