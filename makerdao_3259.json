                    "content": "After observing the USDC PSM in action for over a month now, it is becoming clear that the fees in the DAI \u2192 USDC direction are uncompetitive. So far the PSM has only produced ~$100 in trades going in the DAI \u2192 USDC direction. The Rates Working Group would like to propose lowering the tout parameter on PSM-USDC-A to encourage more trade volume. There are a few considerations to make in what the new rate should be. I\u2019ll do an overview of each:  Competition Implications Currently Curve provides the best rates when DAI = USDC for any trades around the ~10M or less mark. This is because their fee is 0.04% whereas ours is 0.1% and they have very little slippage around that level. As you increase the trade size, the Curve slippage increases so the PSM becomes more competitive, but there aren\u2019t that many trades at that size. By lowering the fee we will begin to eat into the market share of Curve and increase trade volume / revenue. Around the Curve fee there is an asymptotic effect that we need to take into as well. Since the PSM does not have slippage, we will be strictly dominant over Curve if we set tout to 0.04% (assuming 1 DAI = 1 USDC). This is potentially undesirable as it may cause liquidity on Curve to dry up although it\u2019s worth noting that most of the APY is coming from CRV farming so it may not matter that much. Curve may also decide to lower their fees in response. There is likely a \u201csweet spot\u201d where we can improve volume for the PSM without affecting Curve liquidity.  USDC Implications The closer we get to a 0% tout, the quicker the USDC will drain from the Maker collateral pool. This may be more or less desirable for some.  Peg Implications By tightening the tout parameter we will end up draining the PSM faster than if we didn\u2019t. This will provide less of a buffer in the event of a sudden DAI demand drop-off. It\u2019s unclear if this is a problem, but it\u2019s a consideration none-the-less.  Poll    Should we lower the PSM-USDC-A tout parameter?  No, we should leave it at 0.1% Yes, we should lower it to 0.075% Yes, we should lower it to 0.05% Yes, we should lower it to 0.04% (Curve Fee) Yes, we should lower it to 0.025% Yes, we should lower it to 0% Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until Thursday, February 18th to be included in an on-chain vote the following Monday, February 22nd if any options gain >= 50% of the vote (ignoring Abstains). A ranked choice vote will be used if multiple options are >= 50%. ",

We should not be looking to aggravate the CRV community as they are a great DAI sponge and are helping subsidize Maker\u2019s scaling.   Calling tout a fee is a misnomer, rather it\u2019s a discount applied on $1. Ignoring technical limitations, there is no reason tout couldn\u2019t be negative and MKR holders would still make money. The question we should be asking ourselves is not \u201cWhat is the right tout fee\u201d but rather: \u201cAt what price levels do we want to slap our massive buy and sell wells?\u201d Or put another way, what spread are we trying to capture?   The ideal scenario would not to be have 1DAI = 1USDC hardcoded but rather have a sliding scale between 0.99X and 1.00X similar to Curve\u2019s liquidity provision curve. We are leaving a lot of money on the table right now while still taking on the full USDC risk of the PSM.   Long term, I would like to see us move to a variable pricing PSM, similar to Curve\u2019s structure. In the short-term, I think we should be lowering tout to 0.02% so we still capture a 12bp spread but we also manage to empty the PSM now and again. ",

Does it want to continue with higher USDC backing and try to increase stablecoin trading return by applying \u201cjust about right\u201d tin & tout all the time so market share is increased, or does it want to prioritize lower USDC backing (higher tin & very low tout) at all costs? If the decision is to increase trading revenues, are we going to be ok to be changing both \u2018tin\u2019 and \u2018tout\u2019 dynamically based on DAI price and order book depth observed on AMMs? Don\u2019t forget Curve can also change both \u201cA parameter\u201d or fee being charged. Also, despite Curve LPs making most of the yield from the rewards, this can quickly change if CRV dumps and we might not want to decrease liquidity there by over competing. Based on discussion it feels like the goal is to simultaneously 1) maximize trading return 2) have healthy peg 3) have appropriate amount of USDC in backing and risks compensated. It is going to be hard to increase PSM trading and maintain it and at the same time try to lower the exposure to USDC so DSR can be increased at one point. Maybe first some sort of agreement is needed about how much of the USDC backing community prefers, define some sort of range, so we know whether we want to stimulate DAI to USDC path or USDC to DAI path. Would also help if we had stablecoin vaults already liquidated into PSM. ",

Lets start here.   The goal with this was for PEG management.   If Maker wants to earn return we can do much better by pairing the USDC with DAI and dropping it into curve - even in a 1 off event by governance.     hexonaut:  After observing the USDC PSM in action for over a month now, it is becoming clear that the fees in the DAI \u2192 USDC direction are uncompetitive. So far the PSM has only produced ~$100 in trades going in the DAI \u2192 USDC direction.   So what?   The PSM is a PEG stabilizer and nothing more and I want to echo something @LongForWisdom repeats because I am going to repeat it as well.     LongForWisdom:  Another point is that the PSM is bounded by how much USDC is present. If the tout is lower than tin and the PSM empties, it can\u2019t take any more volume until more USDC is traded in   Without USDC the PSM on the low side is useless.   Sure we can raise SF and then the DSR but honestly keeping USDC on hand in case the DAI PEG goes whacky on the downside is a \u2018good problem to have\u2019.   Maker already earns enough fees, implementers are happy with a well managed PEG.  Honestly @hexonaut how much more do you think the PSM is going to earn going to a .04% profit?   on 100M this is a pizzly 40K if I didn\u2019t slip a decimal here.   Lets be real - the PSM was and IS NOT (at least IMHO) designed or needed to compete with these markets it was to stabilize the PEG plain and simple.   Even so we have not seen this battle tested in any way, nor have we come to consider how a few hundred million USDC on the books might be a really good thing. I keep hearing how hard it would be to utilize this as liquidity to earn what 19% return.  I mean god folks if you want to do anything, capture even part of that 19% with 100M and you have almost doubled Maker revenue.   You could pay 4 people 250K/yr just to work on that one little problem and still bank 18M. Lets focus on low hanging fruit in terms of effort until we have people diddling around with nothing to do and all the low hanging fruit gone.     monet-supply:  I\u2019m fairly certain lowering fees to 0.04% or below will not be well received from a PR perspective.   Agree with this.  There will be other unintended hazards as well I expect.     Primoz:  It is going to be hard to increase PSM trading and maintain it and at the same time try to lower the exposure to USDC so DSR can be increased at one point. Maybe first some sort of agreement is needed about how much of the USDC backing community prefers, define some sort of range, so we know whether we want to stimulate DAI to USDC path or USDC to DAI path. Would also help if we had stablecoin vaults already liquidated into PSM.   I want to echo a few of @Primoz points here.  Deal with USDC vaults before even considering messing with this.    Lowering USDC exposure - as far as I can tell DAI is growing at a massive 1000%yr/yr here (maybe higher honestly).  I do not see people avoiding Maker because of USDC and there may come a time where this massive DAI demand reverses dramatically and we might just want to have a tiered USDC backstop to a PEG driving hard and fast not just down to .99 but possibly below (this will especially be the case when the PSM runs out of USDC on the bottom when it won\u2019t be able to manage anything). I am back to the same proposal type and comments regarding the PSM generally.   We want to provide tiers of capital backstop for PEG management not just when times are good, but when times go bad or get crazy.   Once we run out of USDC all we have left is SF and DSR and as I have stated in the past governance is often too slow to act, and always overshoots.   It is why I advocate for forms of dynamism - as advocated in multiple vault LR, SF, tiers (to spread risk and pricing exposure), dynamic facility usage based rate curves, multiple PSM layers (to manage the PEG but not clamp it so hard and to focus on managing liquidity on both sides of the PEG price particularly during distressed market times).  I also advocated for the same layers softer hand approach on the PSM. Lets be clear here.  The PSM was basically a stop gap desperation attempt to manage the PEG.  While it has worked, many people would agree that it is a heavy handed solution that is likely to be overrun at some point probably to the downside.   I am against using the PSM to compete with other exchanges as I don\u2019t see any positive reason for Maker to do this and the change in return is negligible for the hazards it creates. ",

There will be other unintended hazards as well I expect.   Actually, Curve has a way better algo than us, I am not really sure curve is not going to be happy with a dai at peg 1:1. The curve main issue is a dai that is not at peg as it messed all their algo. They are using 3, 4 or more asserts any move on any of them create incentive on the others. They also have multi pool with multi gas price/ assert price. Even with a PSM at 1:1 they should be happier than without PSM. Instead of speculated on feedback they are going to get. Why don\u2019t we ask them as an informal question \" which rate you guys would you consider as ideal for you?\" Then we can make a decision. @LongForWisdom  is there a PR role in maker? Edit : adding @charlie_eth from curve. Would be great to have his opinion on it. ",

Right now there is such a growth in defi that the teams just barely compete with each other. That is going to change the minute the next crypto downturn sets in. Just think 2018-19 with 10 teams competing for each lender. It is going to be murderous. Same with the dexes - there are way too many already. Curve is well advised to focus on pairs that PSM cannot touch. Long before the next downturn begins I feel we should build out PSM to cover all realistic stablecoins and lower fees to zero or near zero just to build gravity. ",
