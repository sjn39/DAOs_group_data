            "body": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would issue a grant of 40k GTC (0.008% of the GTC treasury) to CLR.Fund, a project with a similar mission as Gitcoin (fund public goods) but with a complementary product.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCLR.Fund is another prominent Quadratic Funding project in the Ethereum ecosystem with a mission/ethos that is similar to Gitcoin. This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund.\n\nSecondarily, this proposal if passed would\n\n- Extend [previous friendly contact](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1383481998417678342) between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions.\n- Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other\u2019s users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs.\n- It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the [Decentralize Gitcoin workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180) gaining speed.\n- By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThis proposal met the minimum number of days for deliberation having been posted on August 15.\n\nRead the full proposal details and the discussion here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240",

                    "content": "Hey Gitcoin Community, Philip Hutchins here to propose a new workstream focused on decentralizing the core Gitcoin platform: the Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream! This post serves as my resume for the lead position and as a means for you to hold me accountable to the high bar you would expect from a workstream this critical to Gitcoin. Though I am relatively new to Gitcoin, I am definitely not new to open source or the decentralization space. My intro to crypto and decentralization was when I joined BitPay in 2014. Reading Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper was an eye opening experience for me just as it has been for many of us in this space. I later went on to work for Storj Labs transitioning into the CTO role and leading the effort to redesign the product and rewrite the codebase to be scalable and decentralized. I later joined a team in the supply chain space designing and building a POC to enable competitors to turn into collaborators, and work together through sharing and utilizing excess resources. Now, a \u201cDecentralize Gitcoin Workstream\u201d sounds super cool but what does it actually mean? Well, Gitcoin is focused on growing and sustaining open source software, much of which is decentralized technology. The whole mission of Gitcoin is centered around giving back to and sustaining the communities around open source software. These are foundational parts of our internet infrastructure, and to promote antifragility, credible neutrality, and to grow funding for public goods it makes perfect sense to decentralize Gitcoin! Currently Gitcoin is built like a web 2.5 app. It\u2019s built on top of a few web3-era technologies utilizing smart contracts on-chain where possible, but also hosted in a centralized manner like a web2 app. For this reason, Gitcoin cannot yet be credibly called decentralized from a technical perspective. Starting with Gitcoin Grants, I propose we work to make the grants system permissionless so that anyone can participate and fork the project, and be credibly neutral to ensure that no one person or entity directly controls the outcomes or direction. The goal of the Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream is to guide and drive the project that will result in us not only being able to call Gitcoin itself a DAO, but Gitcoin Grants (and perhaps even other products) fully decentralized protocols. I could see this workstream evolving in these phases   Phase 1 (we are here) - Gitcoin APIs are available but centralized.  Theme: Design & Documentation This working group\u2019s focus is on  Decentralized Grants Protocol and Architecture Design Formally documenting API, and Protocol      Phase 2 - Decentralized protocol and API is designed, documented, and documentation released  Theme: Implement and release Beta Decentralized Grants API This working group\u2019s focus is on  Decentralizing and documenting data availability. (in a privacy preserving way, of course) Decentralizing the Grants API      Phase 3 - Gitcoin Grants Beta APIs are available, well documented, and decentralized.  Theme: Iterate and move Decentralized Grants from Beta to Production and begin decentralization of Hackathons This working group\u2019s focus is on  Iterate on Decentralizing Grants moving from Beta to Production supporting the \u201cpublic goods prototype workstream\u201d.      Phase 4 - Decentralized Gitcoin Grants in Production.  This working group\u2019s focus is  building a well oiled DevRel machine, which means on evangelizing the mission + APIs + documentation as widely as possible, enabling developers worldwide to create value by building on Gitcoin\u2019s dataset and protocols.      Phase 5 - Serenity - Decentralized Gitcoin Grants tech is humming.  Get involved by joining the discussion here on the Gitcoin forum. ",

Firstly, we need to ordain the current Gitcoin team as the the maintainer of Production and the current stack.   Secondly we need to incentivize an entirely new \u201cradical\u201d dev team that is working an entirely new stack that tears Gitcoin apart and rebuilds everything mobile first.   Finally, I believe strongly that Gitcoin should become a protocol where our data(social, professional, economical) is allocated for stewardship and subsequently mined for value that is redistributed back to the owners of the data and community.(opt in of course) I think this area is quite ripe for exploration, the internet is going back to the edge from once it came, as we radically decentralize more and more of our applications and stacks, decentralizing the social layer become increasingly clear. Count me in for the journey! ",

Personally, I believe in global first startups and companies - so having a fairly decentralized approach and I\u2019d like to propose the introduction of semantic analysis tools to Gitcoin, the Documentation, Discourse as well as Discord, to improve the overall visibility of knowledge within the DAO. The aim of this exercise would be to have semantic maps of topics individuals are working on and long-term \u201calert\u201d individuals at the right time to be able to contribute at the right moment. That\u2019s a fairly high-level proposal but I\u2019d like to get deeper on this, since once applied on the level of the DAO, scaling it to general efforts and mapping out the efforts taking to create public goods, this might enable the better use of multiple resources in a more efficient way. Is someone interested to join me on this mission? ",
