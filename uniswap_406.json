Afterall, they have the biggest interest - vested team tokens. I\u2019d love to hear what the rest of you guys think. P.S. If a moderator decides to lock this thread (which is very usual of him to do), I would appreciate a heads up how this post could be altered so that some discussion could take place, regarding this matter.

Respect is important especially in order to operate a forum like this one well. When a moderator locks your post best not to take is personally I have seen a lot of people have outbursts to their posts being locked which I can understand how being seen to have your post locked can be frustrating and feel silencing in a way but the purpose for moderators choosing to lock posts is usually because it is either \u201coff topic\u201d, \u201cspam\u201d, \u201cduplication\u201d or a topic not related to governance and more so a support question which should be moved to discord as again this is a Governing Forum not a general forum. Duplication of the same topic across multiple posts really limits conversation and requires people to find all the posts their conversation related to and post across multiple posts and is also just more work for a probably already overworked moderation team. Better to have 1 post if possible left open with open discussion on the 1 topic that way making the discussion both easy to follow and easy to moderate. An admin will probably lock this again, again not because its personal but because the topic you\u2019re discussing is best appropriate in this post below as mentioned previously by the admin. I\u2019m sure if you post the above as a comment in the post below people will still follow your conversation if they so feel they want to     Proposal: Reduce amount of UNIs required to submit governance proposal Proposal Discussion       10M UNIs are required to submit governance proposals, that\u2019s insanely high. That\u2019s like ~$65M worth by today\u2019s price.  Proposal: reduce it to 10k. The community is already wanting to make proposals but they won\u2019t go anywhere with this limit.  It\u2019s understandable there are risks given the airdrop, but the team, their backers, and the wider community can surely thwart any  obvious attempts to weaponize governance.  [index]     ",

This is the purpose of this forum to discuss governance topics and to have those discussions exactly as you describe above. If you know someone who has a view a governnace idea link them to  this forum or an article it is more than just the team that has a say in this as a governnace token its also holders of UNI who will ideally have a say on proposed changes. It\u2019s the people making the ideas that should be pushing them out and gaining the attention of UNI holders if they they believe their idea to be a good idea. Having centralised social media account picking and choose what to share would just come with controversy. Again would stick to admins advice and move this to the correct forum as it more than likely will end up being locked as it could be seen as a repetitive post. Hopefully I\u2019ve helped cleared some things up for you around how your post may seem linked to where the admin suggests the topic should go ",
