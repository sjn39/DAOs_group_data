We have 4 smart contracts running but they deal with ETH: For example, a property owner sells his property on vave.io Now, investors will purchase parcels of that property during the crowdsale stage, and they would preferably pay with Stable DAI to avoid fluctuations during the crowdsale. As soon as the crowdsale ends, the investor gets his ERC20 Real Estate Tokens, and this will allow the investor to get monthly rental revenues to be cashed out, and this should be done with STable DAI, now we use it but with ETH which can break the process because it fluctuates, we absolutely need STABLE DAI and preferably STABLE DAI EURO Can we use stable dai to distribute rentals dividends to real estate erc20 token holders? We have a total of 2 smart contracts (out of a total of 4) that handle ETH for now but we need them to use Stable DAI (Smart contracts: KYC Whitelist + Token + Crowdsale + Dividends distribution) Is there a pre made solution (open source code) for this?
