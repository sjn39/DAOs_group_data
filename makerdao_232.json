However, I don\u2019t think that MKR has enough utility. I know rune suggested ideas like locking your MKR for years to get free loans but those are not things that people in Defi tend to do, specially with MKR performance during this bull-run being quite boring. I think we can say you get x% discount based on your MKR balance during the time you are borrowing money and when you want to repay the loan the weighted average of the discounts is reduced from the interest. something like this can be good: 1 MKR \u2192 5% discount 5 MKR \u2192 10% 10 MKR \u2192 15% \u2026 5000 MKR \u2192 50% You get the idea. In the future when asset managers like yearn finance want to borrow DAI to put it in use in big volumes they will be incentivized to own MKR. I think this idea solely can have enough benefits for MKR holders that maker burning wouldn\u2019t be much needed (although right now it doesn\u2019t seem to be burning either, less than 1% of the supply has been burned since the beginning). This way, vault owners will be ingrained in the community too. Another idea that I have is allowing big MKR holders to run their own debt pools. They can put up MKR as collateral so if they don\u2019t manage the pool well their MKR is auctioned. The pool managers can allow people to mint DAI with riskier assets like LP positions or new defi coins. This is kind of like Rari-Capital and can put maker in a position that abracadabra.money can be implemented as a single debt pool on maker. If enough pool managers exist the competition and risk tolerance can make makerdao move faster, for example to list an asset like OHM maybe all the community doesn\u2019t agree with the safety but an individual decides the potential benefits outweigh risks and lists this asset in their own pool. Of course most of the fees generated by these pools can be kept for their managers and some of it given to maker itself so there are huge incentives to run these pools if you already have large amounts of MKR. There are many things that need to be tuned for this idea though, like deciding who can run pools well by the community etc\u2026 But I think it\u2019s doable and can reduce the pressure of reaching consensus among all community for each single change. In my opinion a Maker 2.0 is needed to allow us to benefit from all new defi developments and increase maker\u2019s dominance in the lending market so we can all brainstorm about new features that can make makerdao more interesting to use.

The proposal aims to incentivize asset managers to own MKR and allow big MKR holders to run their own debt pools. The post also suggests that a Maker 2.0 is needed to benefit from new DeFi developments and increase Maker's dominance in the lending market.

This means that each MKR holder, at each block, should get a dividend proportional to (B) above, depending on how many MKR they hold vs total MKR in circulation. Then I propose: the discount on the SF of a vault should just be equal to this dividend (in that specific block). Motivation: It just makes sense to directly discount the SF of a Vault of a MKR-holder from the amount of Money that they are rightfully expected to get as dividend from the SF on their Vault. Example: Suppose I have 1k MKR, and that there are 1m MKR in circulation. Suppose I have a vault and the SF accrued in the next block is 1 DAI. Then I get a discount of 1k/1m = 0.001 DAI on the SF of that block. So I just get to pay 0.999 DAI, instead of 1DAI. ",

Here the MKR represents a discount though, which one could argue is not the same thing. I think Nexo uses this model and I am unsure of its actual utilization. To me it feels projects have been implementing this primarily for regulatory reasons - again, utility tokens hypothesis\u2026 I do support implementation of mechanisms where borrowers get certain benefits, but in return they should provide something that lowers risk of their exposure. For instance, I\u2019d certainly like more to be rewarding (or offering discounts) for high collateralization ratio vaults, or vaults subscribed to protection services. This though wouldn\u2019t solve the \u201clack of MKR utility\u201d addressed in this post. I do think if people locked MKR/DAI LPs or MKR/ETH LPs to get SF benefits, this should have positive effects in a situation where we\u2019d have to potentially cover loss with MKR dilution, because MKR liquidity would be more robust in tail scenarios if part of MKR LP liquidity gets locked. It is basically the same model that Aave employs, but in this proposed case you would be rewarding vault users and not only MKR token holders. So it is not a bad idea from a risk point of view (adjusted for locking in MKR LP liquidity instead of only MKR), just not sure of its actual utilization in practice. It can also get very complex when trying to price this, because it is hard to measure risk benefits. ",

By doing this you will incentivize them to hold MKR because even if you have a 1M$ Dai loan which you have to pay 20K interest for it, you can just buy 1 MKR and pay 19K interest per year which makes buying that MKR very attractive and basically free if you want to hold that position for more than 2 years. I\u2019m sure there are larger vaults who would be willing to buy much more MKR. This will make vault owners own mkr and become part of the DAO too which is very beneficial long term. By the way $dydx has really took off and the only functionality of their token is this. You can\u2019t simply throw in a bad example and say the model is bad, at least consider the benefits and then provide valid counter-arguments. ",

Biggest point is that the vault owner would have to put the MKR into governance - or actually better pair it with DAI and toss it into Uniswap or sushiswap v2 LP (which also should be a possible way to deposit MKR into governance btw - so governance and liquidity issues don\u2019t compete). Realize this is just a kind of feed forward of the DAI they would have paid on interest back to them. A cleaner way to accomplish this is to basically use a rewards token like my MKR-R and then basically the user gets MKR-R rewards for depositing collateral in a vault (a deposit return of some small value), borrowing DAI,  a borrow reward multiplier related to CR relative to LR (from 0-1).  Here what you can do is give a rewards multiplier on any or all of the above if the wallet has MKR deposited into governance and maintains some participation level. This is all cleanly doable with another token and in fact we can even put a drip and vesting component on all of this to align all incentives to longer term participation total value locked, whatever (possibilities are really endless here). Couple in ability to pair MKR with DAI in sushi or uni v2 LP vaults and put that into governance and we could have a very powerful system\u2026   This is the kind of stuff I was thinking about when I looked at @rune sagittarious engine\u2026 ",

If they already beleive this they have an incentive to hold MKR already as long as they beleive that maker profits will be distributed to MKR holders through the burning mechanism. This proposal would just increase this incentive slightly. If they do not beleive this, they would not buy MKR just because of the discount.   This proposed discount seems to favourise large players, meaning that large players would get a proportional larger share of the profit (both discount in proportion of MKR holdings and regular profits through the burning mechanism). As such, smaller players could actually be less incentivised to hold- or purchase MKR. As long as we want a diversification among MKR holders, this risk should be taken into consideration.   In general I think we should be very carefull with implementing changes in the MKR tokenomics that could reduce the transparency or the belief that each MKR receieves its share of the profit. As long as MKR holders have this belief they will allways be inventiviced to hold- or purchase MKR as long as they beleive the maker protocol will generate more profit than the current MKR price implicitly says ",

My second idea in this post gives a solution for that too but it seems no one bothered to read it. Oh and by the way! The burn mechanism is so hilarious!

But agree, we probably do need \u201cadded features\u201d to MKR so that new DeFi tokens don\u2019t make bluechips such as MKR irrelevant. I am sure @rune is working on his updated model. Instead of simply locking in MKR to get cheap loans, I was thinking of an OHM style bonds approach where you create a special ETH vault with 0% fees where only users who lock MKR/DAI liquidity can use it. This liquidity then protects Maker in bad debt events. This way the users actually provide something in return for zero fee loan. I think such tokenomic model is healthier than the free-riding approach some token models employ lately. But again, I have no idea how many users would utilize this and if there is enough of a incentive\u2026This model could also backfire - a whale sees this opportunity and sells half of his MKR into DAI. So maybe its a bad one, but I\u2019d like we start thinking in the direction of how we can increase risk buffer by offering lower fees. ",

Besides stating that MKR have underperfomed against ETH I can\u2019t see that you actually adressed the concerns I listed? Regarding your critisism of the burning mechanism it is also my opinion that it is possible that the low level of burning perfomed up until now, combined with several discussions around possible changes in the tokenomics, have made some MKR holders doubt whether they actually will be entitled to their proportianal share of the profit made by the protocol. So while I agree that it makes sense to build up a surplus buffer for risk and growth purposes I think it is important that there is in place a transparent policy regarding the proportion of profits that shall be burned, and that this is not changed every time the protocol actually starts burning.

My main concern with this proposal is that strategic players would not buy MKR unless they beleive the current MKR price is low compared to their own estimate of future cash flow from the protocol. A discount based on MKR holdings would only shift this incentive slightly since the discount they receive would have to be insignifcant compared to the total cash flow for the protocol.

Pumps tactics are just a waste of time and focus.   These are not pump tactics my friend. While i believe long term growth is important I think tokenomics for MKR can benefit from improving. I actually don\u2019t know any one holding lots of MKR but if I myself did I could see myself running a debt pool. Why? because defi always has new things and for new things to be approved by all the community it takes time. Look at someone like tetronode. They can very well manage a large pool on rari capital. You think people won\u2019t do that if the issuer of dai provided this feature? I somewhat agree with your point about discounts though, but you\u2019re viewing people as bots who want to optimize a function for profits saying \u201cDiscount is just allocating resources from those not using the discount to those using it.\u201d Discounts will also incentivize vault owners to own mkr and add some value to the project if they feel like it in the future. Why do you think abracadabra is doing staking and sharing profits with people who stake their spell? It\u2019s not just to pump the price IMO, it is also to form a strong community. Why do you think defi protocols give airdrops to people? Because it\u2019s just nice to give back to people and people see that and like you more. All i see on crypto twitter about makerdao is that there is lots of USDC backing it up, and the only users of makerdao are very OG defi users or whales. Go watch Taiki Maeda video about makerdao vs abracadabra. He says I don\u2019t see anyone using makerdao and he\u2019s right, at least the people I know don\u2019t use it either. ",

I would say that Airdrop is more of an advertisement to spread awareness. It\u2019s a purely promotional product sample, a marketing tool, nothing more.  Even if it creates a liking for the product and the company, it can be very random and easily fleeting. I think that with Sourcecred, Maker can achieve more targeted, useful giveaways than just sprinkling these Dai with Airdrops because it rewards real participation. ",
