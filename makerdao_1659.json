                    "content": "This forum post serves as notification for legal text changes within the HVB Master Participation Agreement (MPA). HVB has proposed clarification amendments to the Master Participation Agreement. Maker legal counsel and Ankura Trust have reviewed the proposed amendments and find the changes acceptable and consistent with the general Loan Eligibility Criteria. The proposed amendments clarify the types of loans intended to be broadly captured by each loan category. These clarifications are the result of several back-and-forths with Ankura Trust Holdings (the calculation agent) and are necessary to enable them, in their review and approval/rejection of loans for sale to the RWA Master Participation Trust, to have greater specificity in loan types and sub-categories. Without the greater specificity, Ankura Trust will likely reject the proposed loan participation as not meeting the eligibility criteria, thus excluding loans that were intended, by the broader categorization, to be included.  The following is the Executive text: If this Executive Proposal is passed, MKR token holders hereby approve of the amendments to Annex I and Annex II of the Master Participation Agreement between Huntingdon Valley Bank and RWA Master Participation Trust dated July 12, 2022, and authorize Zedra (Directors) Cayman Limited, as sole director of RWA Foundation, to execute and deliver such agreements, and provide Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (as trustee of the RWA Master Participation Trust and in its capacity as Verification Agent) such instructions, in each case, as may be necessary, to give effect to the amendments.  Reference  Current documents, these are being voted on: Redlined Doc, v2 - IPFS Final Doc, v2 - IPFS  Past documents, for historical purpose: Redlined Doc, v1 - IPFS Final Doc, v1 - IPFS ",

                    "content": "For @Recognized-Delegates, MKR Holders, and the broader community I wanted to give some insight as to why this Governance Path was chosen. TL;DR: The updating of the agreement will go to poll on Monday, September 5th for consideration. If passed it will be included in the next compatible executive proposal, likely to be up for a vote on Sept. 14th. Some might rightfully inquire why this item is being requested for a poll rather than executive inclusion (we had a legal agreement update up for vote a little over two weeks ago that went straight into the executive). For minor updates and housekeeping, a facilitator exercising their right to push the amendments directly into an executive makes perfect sense. They are a housekeeping matter in need of nothing more than a stamp of approval on our end. Since facilitators can be directly removed from the DAO for misconduct or not upholding the protocol\u2019s interest, this expediency can carry high consequences if not used for minutia or urgent/emergency circumstances. This particular situation skirts the edge of what could be included (as detailed below) so after talking it over with @monkey.irish we decided to go the more conservative route. @monkey.irish as the facilitator of CES-001 felt that the community should have ample time to consider this update; I agreed and recommended this course of action. By going to a poll, Recognized Delegates will have to present their reasoning on the matter, allowing the need for additional clarification to surface before we wrap it into an executive bundle.  For a bit more detail on the situation above, @g_dip has explained that there was a mismatch between what was negotiated in the body of the terms on the RWA-009 (HVBank) deal and the resulting annex that was attached to those terms. Because the items are being executed by a trustee, only the more conservative description of the terms will be acted on. Thus, at present HVBank are unable to deploy the full range of loans negotiated until Annex I and II are updated via an executive vote. Normally, a mismatch/potential clerical error on our end would go straight to an executive if a facilitator noted the issue and recommended a fix. However, this fix does represent a noticeable change to the status quo of the operating vault, one that might have ramifications on the risk profile of the facility. Previously, GovAlpha would turn to the @Real-World-Finance Facilitator to process a request like this and detail the potential changes to the community. @collateral-core-unit has an overlapping mandate in the area of RWA Collateral, so while it is fully appropriate for @monkey.irish to request this be sent straight to an executive vote, this path allows any further questions from knowledgeable members of the community to be addressed beforehand. I hope that by tagging the involved parties and Recognized Delegates, we will be able to sort out any risk considerations before this item is up for a vote. Please keep in mind that the current portfolio of loans could be riskier than the full list negotiated in the body of the agreement. This is not a risk on/off paradigm. Rather, we have an attestation that the agreement needs to be amended from our counterparty and no involvement from Core Unit that most closely fits the required work to process it. @monkey.irish has stepped in to bring the item to consideration as (potentially) the only other appropriate party to address the matter without a broader governance action that would take much longer to resolve.

Therefore the way to view this amendment is as adding the necessary detail to bring the annex in line with the term sheet and the agreement. For example, the annex quotes credit scores. But which credit score? What if there\u2019s three? In HVBs normal operations, they will generally use the average. The redline above further clarifies that.

To explain this to the Maker community in simple words:  An ANNEX to a contract is one or more documents, that constitute an immediate extension of a contract.

I kept it simple as the rationale is simple. From postings, there appears to be some misunderstanding as to the nature and rationale of the request that I will address below.     flipflopflapdelegate:  However, one of the Legal Domain Teams acting on behalf of MakerDAO made a Human error and did not update the FINAL Term Sheet and Agreement, therefore Ankura cannot act since the requirements were incomplete? (needs clarification)   This is not correct. HVB, Ankura Trust and each of their respective counsel reviewed the Master Participation Agreement and the Annexes. HVB and its counsel \u201ccontrolled the pen\u201d in the drafting of the Master Participation Agreement, including the Annexes. To pin responsibility for \u201chuman error\u201d on the \u201cLegal Domain Teams acting for MakerDAO\u201d is inaccurate and revisionist. The MIP6 application Here and the Term Sheet described in the Risk Assessment Here are consistent with Annex I and Annex II in the executed Master Purchase Agreement.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Ankura did the right thing for the benefit of MakerDAO   Sure. They are following the guidelines set forth in the Annexes.     prose11:  @g_dip has explained that there was a mismatch between what was negotiated in the body of the terms on the RWA-009 (HVBank) deal and the resulting annex that was attached to those terms   Annexes I and II are the Loan Eligibility Criteria. There is not a mismatch.     prose11:  Because the items are being executed by a trustee, only the more conservative description of the terms will be acted on.   Yes, but to be clear, it is not the trustee that makes a decision. Ankura, in its capacity as calculation agent, will review the proposed loans and give sign-off or not. WSFS, as trustee, will only follow what Ankura tells it to do. I recognize that this may seem a small difference. But it is a crucial difference as Ankara\u2019s role in the Master Participation Agreement is critical to ensure trustlessness.  In some form, the MIP6 application, the Term Sheet and the Master Participation Agreement all provide the following: \u201cAll loans originated or purchased by HVB in its ordinary course of business and that in all factors comply with the Bank\u2019s credit policy and loan origination guidelines shall be considered to be eligible for Participated Loans.\u201d Each restate the Loan Eligibility Criteria in Annexes I and II. In my view, the proposed revisions build upon the above language and clarify, as needed, what is meant by \u201cordinary course of business\u201d and \u201cBank\u2019s credit policy and loan origination guidelines\u201d. For instance, under the heading \u201cCommercial Construction and Investment Real Estate Secured Loans\u201d, HVB will likely have more varieties of loan instruments than a \u201camortizing commercial mortgage (not interest only)\u201d. And, given the broad \u201cordinary course of business\u201d and \u201cBank\u2019s credit policy and loan origination guidelines\u201d language, the clarification language appeared to be acceptable. I fully support both @monkey.irish\u2019s and @prose11\u2019s approach to have Maker token holder review and consideration. While I do consider the revisions to clarify the intentions described above, I believe that thoughtful consideration and transparency is important. ",

                    "content": "As asked by @0xbocaJ , here is a quick take on the modification on the Loan Eligibility Criteria was asked to Strategic Finance CU. This is not a professional work and should be viewed as just one uninformed opinion.  Context The original signed Master Participation Agreement (being updated here) can be viewed here and was linked here. The risk assessment, which was used to inform MKR token holders, is here followed by the term sheet. The risk assessment is in line with the original signed Master Participation Agreement.  TL;DR The changes are, in my view, increasing the risk profile, but remain in line with the spirit of both the MIP6 and the original signed Master Participation Agreement. MakerDAO needs short-term maturities (max 5-year here) which makes construction loans and bridge loans more suited to fit our needs. HVB has skin in the game with a remaining 50% partition in the loans. The first 2 loans accepted under the agreement are 5-year maturity. For the time being, we cannot scale with that, especially if we want to prepare for an eventual depeg in 3-years. On a side note, this investment is not riskless and MKR token holders should monitor the interest rate, maturity and duration of this investment.  Main changes  Scope of loan types The scope of acceptable type of loan is extended. Initially it was only:  Amortizing commercial mortgage (not interest only) Revolving line of credit  The new version adds more types.  Bridge loans were added. Those are of a shorter maturity but they are riskier as there is a refinancing risk. For construction, LTV is limited to 75% which seems good. The added risk means a higher yield for MakerDAO as we are participating. By their nature, bridge loans might be a good source of origination fees for HVB for which MakerDAO gets no share. Nevertheless, as our appetite is on the short term for which bridge loans are a good fit. Amortizing commercial loans with an interest-only part are now allowed (the \u201c(not interest only)\u201d was removed). This is an increase in risk as it increases the exposure at default (as the principal of the loan wasn\u2019t already partially repaid). Nevertheless, this is in line with the term sheet which didn\u2019t have the not interest only part.  Financial covenants This section was added and seems to be related to the change in the scope of loans.   Credit score If a principal has many scores, it will now take the average, which was undefined before. If there are many principals, it will take the lowest one, it was undefined before. No analysis of volatility of credit score was performed, neither do we have the list of credit score providers. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a big difference, it\u2019s more a clarification.   Concentration limits The concentration limits have changed as well by removing the Commercial Real Estate Investments from Industry to Investment Real Estate. From the Risk Assessment, we can see that the loan book of HVB is mainly commercial real estate of which half is construction loans. We don\u2019t have the part of CREI but one can assume it is significantly more than 25%. The segmentation seems more clear this way and, in my view, matches the spirit of the discussion.  ",

Understood. However, not sure how community members who review it on the forums are responsible for making sure Ankura got All the ingredients. But okay, all good \u2014 totally get it. Just hoping that this model can somehow be streamlined into an automated onboarding application that others can use in the near future. Thanks bud.     christiancdpetersen:  To pin responsibility for \u201chuman error\u201d on the \u201cLegal Domain Teams acting for MakerDAO\u201d is inaccurate and revisionist.   Errr, \u201crevisionist\u201d is a bit harsh don\u2019t you think. And I was referring to the Legal Team that some of the work was outsourced to (I think it was Latham & Watkins, or the other firm who\u2019s name skips my mind) not a MakerDAO team member, or CU. Anyhow \u2014 thanks for the clarifying\u2014 as I stated above\u2014I was personally hopeful that this HVB onboarding model can somehow be streamlined into an automated onboarding application that other RWA arrangers can use in the near future.     SebVentures:  Bridge loans were added. Those are of a shorter maturity but they are riskier as there is a refinancing risk. For construction, LTV is limited to 75% which seems good. The added risk means a higher yield for MakerDAO as we are participating.   I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Not the biggest fan of construction loans even at 75% LTV \u2014 but totally appreciate your analysis & input here.  ",
