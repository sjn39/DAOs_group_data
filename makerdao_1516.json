                    "content": "Today and tomorrow I will be presenting some new content related to a concept called the Target Collateral Portfolio, which is a central feedback loop of the Endgame Plan that in the past I haven\u2019t focused on so much (it was covered briefly under the Farm Balancing Lever), but I have learned that it is very helpful for people to understand the point of the plan and make it \u201cclick\u201d, so I am reworking the communications to use this concept as the starting point to understand the other elements of the plan. Additionally, I will also talk about a simplification of the tokenomics that removes most features of the Midgame and Endgame (that have yet to be posted on the forum) - so more or less everything that I have already explained at this point are the totality of all features and complexity of the Endgame Plan. Then with this additional context and clarification, we can continue the practical discussion of how to actually cluster the MetaDAOs and how to holistically reorganize the workforce and deal with things like budgets, with the Endgame Plan in mind.
