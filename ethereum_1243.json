I expect we would see more state cleanup in the gradual scenario.   @timbeiko: Generally agree, although 1m blocks (~1y) seems very long, especially given the \u201cadvance warning\u201d w.r.t. this actually hitting mainnet. IMO if we\u2019re planning to, say, have another upgrade around Q4/Q1, we should aim to have the refund at 0 by then, and then we can maybe simplify a lot of code on the next fork. So, in other words, ~1 year from today seems fine, but not ~1 year from London hitting mainnet  ",

I would suggest 64 over 50 for a rounder number, but if they must be removed by the following major upgrade, 1,900,000 is a reasonable timetable. For 64 it would be 1,216,000 blocks, about 7 months. There were 1,789,000 blocks (282 days) between Constantinople and Istanbul, and Istanbul/Muir has gone for almost 3,000,000. For theoretically larger intra-tx refunds such as the 19800 specified by EIP-1283, I would not suggest to wait the full decay period since the refund was not stored between transactions. For that case it would be sufficient to go forward with an upgrade that replaces the remaining intra-tx refund with some negative-gas mechanic. From Github:  GasTokens are effectively an exploit  As a speedrunning enthusiast I wouldn\u2019t categorize any feature being used in a way the developers are aware of and call a net-positive as an exploit.  It\u2019s not our fault that certain people hoarded them against this advice. And most certainly it shouldn\u2019t lead to stretching out selfdestruct phase out.  I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve been hoarding them. We use hundreds to tens of thousands per week depending on congestion, and the amount we hold is reasonable for our business. We have to hedge against the gas price volatility and insure against the worst-case. It\u2019s easy to criticize us if you don\u2019t participate in PGAs or need to use the network in peak congestion, but refund usage is not optional, and our gas reserve is rational. If refund removal cannot be delayed for whatever reason, core devs might prefer the cleanup-and-compensation alternative I am currently writing up, tho that will be more work for them. ",

I don\u2019t think 5 months would be enough time to burn even half of them, especially without the diminishing efficiency. This is also fairer to refund holders, especially illiquid refund holders who can\u2019t just dump on some poor AMM LP. On a 5 month schedule I would suggest cleanup and compensation, where all of the refund contracts are replaced by EIP similar to the DAO fork, and refund holders receive freshly minted ETH at some fair gas price, perhaps totaling several thousand ETH. But the real cost of this would be developer time. ",
