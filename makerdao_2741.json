While investors rush to give us USDC to keep the peg at/below 1.01, they\u2019re abandoning their CPDs (and getting a free option if DAI drops below 1). This is very effective at keeping DAI pegged to 1-1.01 USDC, but does lead to us relying too heavily on another stable coin (and probably stable coins in general imo, but that can be another discussion. From a stability point of view DAI is currently strictly worse than USDC, since a collapse of USDC could not be made whole be MKR, since the MKR market cap is roughly equal to our USDC holdings and would surely fall quite a bit if USDC collapsed. I propose limiting any given collateral source to have a debt ceiling at most 1/5 of MKR market cap (or some parameter settable by Maker, ideally something lower than 1/5 over time). This could be done in real time independently/in addition to our current debt ceilings, through the use of price oracles that check at some reasonable time interval. Collateral would have to clear all debt ceilings (if we kept our current ones in addition) in order for more debt to be added, but ceiling changes wouldn\u2019t mess with/liquidate existing debt. I also propose having debt ceilings for asset classes overall (so that we could say that at most 1/4 or 1/3 of our assets come from stable coins). However, this seems less pressing to me. ",

It is correct to strictly restrict certain debt ceiling ratios, especially the ratio of volatile assets. Because volatile assets usually have black swan events (for example, the ETH black swan event in March caused us serious losses). Fortunately, we have a \u201cMKR\u201d mechanism, otherwise the consequences are unimaginable. I think the ratio of stable assets to unstable assets of 1:1 is more appropriate. This ratio will make DAI more stable. If volatile assets account for too much, DAI will return to its previous unstable state (whenever the market fluctuates sharply, DAI will fluctuate). ",

In fact, almost all assets fall into this category. Unfortunately most assets we will ever onboard have at least the custodial risk of hard pegged stablecoins. It may make more sense to split maker custodial vs noncustodial assets 50/50. We could even have a number of evenly weighted types, though this becomes complicated pretty fast. Broadly I think we could split assets up into 6ish asset types organized from low to high volatility:  Fiat-Like (stablecoins, the True currency tokens, SUSD, maybe in the future RAI and other algorithmic stablecoins) Bond-like (treasuries, emerging market bonds, liquidity provider tokens(especially stablecoin pairs)) Commodity-like (paxg, other gold backed tokens. Hopefully there will be other kinds in the future) Equity-like (real estate tokens, maybe in the future tokens for the s&p and other major indexes) Crypto native tokens (ETH, WBTC, most ERC20 tokens) Other: options, swaps, advanced derivatives that only crypto can support, whatever you can dream.  We should probably do our best to diversify across these asset categories. Atm we only have vaults for Fiat-like and Crypto native ",

But I suspect that rather than a strict rule (or even, an algorithmic one enforced directly by smart contract code) it would be better to have just a declaration of intent. For example the DAO could approve by voting something like:  During ordinary circumstances, we will try to limit our exposure to a single collateral type following the \u201c1/5 ratio rule\u201d.  Or something like that. The reason I am saying this is obvious. Nobody here is very happy about having so much USDC onboard. But we were literally forced to do that, to get peg close to 1:1. Hopefully this will change soon with RWA or other developments in DeFi. But I think it\u2019s good to keep some flexibility and not limit ourselves too much with strict rules. ",

In general I would like to see something like this implemented by the community, but at this time it probably can\u2019t, and won\u2019t happen, for many practical as well as political reasons. It is something we should review though as RWA comes on line.   One of my concerns is that we end up with DAI outstanding far and away greater than the MKR cap which will expose the system but there is nothing we can do about MKR market cap. BTW:  The above and many other considerations went into the reasoning why we should start issuing MKR to compensate farmers and then to increase BR.   To start to get everyone used to the idea of using MKR for all kinds of things and to create a more dynamic economy.  FYI - provided the price wouldn\u2019t collapse a slow MKR inflation really would be good to increase MKR cap.   There is a reason that stocks split and that is because average joes are not going to go for .1 Bershire A at 250K/unit - which is why there is a Berkshire B that is a little cheaper etc. I keep coming back to issuing a MKR-R reward token that has a plan to be included in governance as well as exchange for MKR proper to take advantage of the whole farming hype and to possibly give Maker another token that could have additional cap to be used to fill system shortfalls. Imagine that MKR-R is used first when flopping for DAI to fill a shortfall.  ",

Right now I expect the community to feel forced to expand the USDC debt ceiling again later this year, which seems concerning given what that means DAI is turning into in my mind. Separately, I think the community hasn\u2019t fully appreciated what it means to have a liquidation ratio of 1.01. I\u2019ll make a prediction now that there\u2019s a substantial possibility that a lot of this USDC collateral gets sold at a price that values DAI at >1.01 USDC and loses Maker money, getting us a temporary relief in the short term that\u2019s more costly than we realize.
