Optimistic Bunnies NFT was the first NFT collection to deploy on Optimism. The 4 collections have around 9000 holders combined, making it one of the largest NFT communities on Optimism. We also donated more than 6ETH toward Optimism Public Goods Funding. We look to continue our collaboration with other dapp projects in the Optimism Ecosystem. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: As the first NFT deployed on Optimism, we have one of the largest communities of NFT holders on optimism. A lot of our NFT holders are actively participating in other communities on Optimism as well. The team has also demonstrated integrity by delivering on its project roadmap. The team has built a lot of good will with many communities on Optimism. The project will find success by continuing to develop good will and partnership with other communities on Optimism. How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: There are 4 NFT collections in the Optiland NFT series. There are around 9000 holders of the NFTs based on Etherscan token tracker Optimistic Bunnies:    Optimistic Ethereum L2 Explorer   Optimistic Bunnies (Bunny) Token Tracker | Optimism Optimistic Bunnies (Bunny) Token Tracker on Etherscan shows the price of the Token $0.0000, total supply 3,898, number of holders 2,367 and updated information of the token.

Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: The grant will be used to incentivize program participants to learn more about the different dapps on Optimism through a series of \u201clearn and earn\u201d. As program participants become more educated about the dapps, they will most likely start to try out those dapps, potentially increasing their participation in the Optimism ecosystem and drive OP token and gas usage. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them. We will target current Optiland NFT owners, users of other dapps on Optimism, and Ethereum users from the main net. We will aim to increase both the number of users (breadth) and also the depth of their involvement in the Optimism ecosystem. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: NFTs are often the gateway for onboarding an user with an ecosystem. In 2021, Opensea accounted for a large volume of gas usage on Ethereum main net, which is one of the main reasons that drove L2 adoption. We will use the OP tokens as an incentive for program participants to interact with the Optiland NFT tokens plus the Optimism dapps that we will introduce to the program participants. As participants learn more about the dapps that exist in the Optimism ecosystem, they will be more likely to try those dapps; thus increasing the likelihood that they will stay engaged within the Optimism ecosystem as a power user. The program aims to create a group of Optimism power users who would stay engaged in the Optimism ecosystem.

Please link to code audits (if any): No audit Team Who are your founders?: Cryptofox and distractionboy What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? Both Cryptofox and distractionboy has been involved in the Optimism NFT ecosystem since its inception. We both have demonstrated integrity and delivered on key milestones as outlined in their roadmap. We will both continue to deliver on our project and the grant proposal. Is this your first Web3 project?: No If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): distractionboy worked with the collab.land team to implement its discord bot to support Optimism network. It\u2019s used in almost all Optimism NFT projects. He also helped to build Optichads NFT Grant Request What is the size of the grant request?: 20,000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: We plan to distribute the grant over 16 weeks, making 1,250 weekly distributions to the Optiland NFT community. Given the potential for thousands of participants in the project, the size seems appropriate. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: How will the OP tokens be distributed? Over what period will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Proposal for token distribution:  We will use quest3 as a platform to set up weekly \u201clearn and earn\u201d quests to program participants. 100% of the tokens will be distributed to participants over 16 weeks. A different Optimism dapp will be selected each week for participants to learn. Participants would need to write a short description of what they learned about the dapp to qualify for the weekly OP reward. A manual review will then be taken at the end of the week to verify the validity of the participants\u2019 submissions.  See mock quest example: Learn and Earn Examp The weekly quests will aim to create a community of power users within the Optimism ecosystem. Learning about the different protocols selected during the weekly quests is the first step toward increasing the usage of different protocols in the Optimism ecosystem and will likely bring more users to Optimism. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Milestones can be measured on:  Milestones will be met weekly and will include a weekly quest and a review of the quest from the previous week.  A new quest will be launched every Sunday and publicize it on Optiland\u2019s Twitter and Discord accounts.  Public metrics such as how many users attempted a quest and completed a quest will be published every week.  Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Critical Milestone is:  Publish an update on this thread that details the quests initiated to date, how many users attempted each, how many successfully completed the quests, and how much of the grant was given out. This will occur no later than 6 weeks from receipt of OP tokens. If the grant plan needs adjustment based on learnings from the first 6 weeks, those will be communicated clearly in this update.  The team\u2019s wallets will be excluded from both rewards and any key metrics being measured. If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: The stickiness of the Optimism ecosystem is dependent on user engagements. The program will attempt to create a community of educated and power users of the optimism ecosystem who are likely to stay engaged in the Optimism ecosystem and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem after the incentive period. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Same as L2 recipient address Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Optimism is one of the largest Ethereum L2 network with a growing ecosystem. Optimism has released the OP token in 2022 as a way to incentivize participation and growth in the Optimism ecosystem. Growing the ecosystem requires participation of many different stakeholders from various communities to work toward a common purpose to move users who are priced out of Ethereum main net to Optimism. The OP token is a great way to incentivize participation in the Optimism ecosystem. OP tokens will be used to incentivize the Optiland NFT community to learn more about the different dapps that exist in the Optimism ecosystem including defi, NFTs, bridges, Wallets, Onramp, and tools. Learning about the different protocols that exist in the Optimism ecosystem is the first step toward onboarding users to those protocols. The distribution program aims to increase participation and engagements in the optimism ecosystem. The program aims to drive up OP token adoption and gas usage which will ultimately benefit the ecosystem and further increase the adoption of the Optimism network.

Is there is a requirement to hold multiple collections in order to participate in some of the educational quests by creating a tier system for the holders who have more than one collection? This may increase the stickiness of the project and provide a higher level of on chain recognition for the most dedicated members of the ecosystem in Optiland Quests token rewards program. Resulting in larger rewards for users of this caliber and prevent mercenaries from purchasing the cheaper collection out of the four that are a part of the program or opening multiple wallets to farm the token rewards. Any other mechanism to increase the impact of one user who is easy to identify on chain rather than the profit many will try to make from farming.

Not strictly necessary, but is there a past or draft version of one of these that we could see as an example?     Cryptofox:  Milestones can be measured on:  Milestones will be met weekly and will include a weekly quest and a review of the quest from the previous week.    We recommend more specificity. For example, your benchmark milestones could be, \u201cLaunch a new quest every Monday and publicize it on communications channels X, Y, and Z\u201d and/or \u201cPublish metrics that include how many users attempted and completed a quest every X weeks.\u201d     Cryptofox:  Please define critical milestones for this project.
