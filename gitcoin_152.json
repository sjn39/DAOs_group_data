First things first, we are renaming Gitcoin Holdings to supermodular.xyz soon.  We are making this move to make explicit our renewed focus on Virtual Events + to disambiguate with any Gitcoin related activity (henceforth it should be assumed that the brand Gitcoin refers to the DAO)  TLDR henceforth in this post I will refer to this entity as supermodular.xyz + would encourage you all to make the vocabulary update ASAP too\u2026 I will now list off the things that I\u2019m aware that supermodular.xyz does for the DAO.  People from the DAO should feel free to (1) list off the work that they know of & (2) pick up or not pick up that work - up to you. Ideally this thread becomes a schelling point for the proactive communication about the transfer of said work.  Big Stuff (as of July 5 2022)  Building Grants 2.0  [moving to GPC workstream] Maintaining Gitcoin Grants 1.0 [moving to GPC workstream]   Minor Stuff (as of July 5 2022)  I administer the gitcoindao.com server [anyone want this?] I update the TLDR - What is Gitcoin? \ud83e\udd16 [Aug 2022] post monthly. [anyone want this?] We have maintained the ENS/DNS for Gitcoin related activities [moving to Gitcoin Foundation] We have maintained several SAAS tools (AWS, sentry, fingerprint.js, notion, etc) for the DAO [moving to Gitcoin Foundation] Hosting DAOVibes weekly [moving to DAO public speaker group] I host a quarterly podcast episode about Gitcoin Grants (here is the most recent one).  [unknown, i suppose I could still do this, just as an outsider looking in?] Probably other stuff, list it below if you are aware of something not listed.   How should supermodular.xyz team members show up in DAO-native spaces ?    Passing the Torch    Once these assets are transferred to the Gitcoin Foundation, Gitcoin Holdings will be formally disaffiliating from \u201cleadership\u201d in the DAO.   The line that we set up in Passing the Torch \ud83d\udd25 was that supermodular.xyz team members would be disaffiliating from \u201cleadership\u201d in the DAO.  This means that they\u2019re not running any of the spaces or core projects of the DAO, but they are still welcome to show up in these spaces in a social or advisory capacity. I am open to feedback on the above. ",
