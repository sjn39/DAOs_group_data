                    "content": "Hey everyone, The Public Goods Funding workstream would like to seek community input on what folks would like to see in terms of structure for GR13. GR13 will run from March 9-24, 2022. Context In prior rounds, the distribution of the Grants Matching Pool had been handled by the Gitcoin Core team (rounds 1-5), and later in consultation with the Funders League (rounds 6-9). In GR10-12, we moved to having distribution based on GTC governance, with matching pool allocations voted on by the stewards a couple weeks prior to round start. For GR13, as we continue on the path of decentralizing Grants Ops from Holdings into the DAO, we want to build the habit of bringing the community in much earlier in the process to provide their input on what they want to see with respect to the matching pool, rather than having a Holdings-proposed structure that stewards simply vote on. This post is an experiment in that spirit! Structure of Prior Rounds Prior to GR12, Gitcoin had typically used categories based on grant types to assign allocations based on a percentage of the total matching pool. More details in the GR12 governance post. In GR12, we ran a \u2018Single Pool Experiment\u2019:  The GR12 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,000,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $25k).  GR12 results to assess for yourself:  Finale event (with discussion of results) Results post Spreadsheet with raw data  Questions to the community  What do you want to see when it comes to the main matching pool in GR13? Is there appetite to bring back categories or do folks want to stick with the single pool approach from GR12? Is there any other experimentation that folks would like to see?  Your input is appreciated. Thanks! ",

And that is especially true of organizations that ask multiple times a year. (I\u2019m just sharing my real-world experience.) I feel like it might be beneficial to grant recipients (such as myself) if the grant rounds were either (a) spread out in time, (b) spread out by category. For (a) what I mean is that the grant rounds could be twice yearly or even annual. I\u2019m already seeing some donor fatigue, not to mention it feels like the previous round just ended and I\u2019m constantly \u201con the ask.\u201d I\u2019ve been told by close friends in private that it seems like I\u2019m constantly asking for funds. But\u2026if I don\u2019t ask\u2026my donations drop off precipitously. I realize that I could choose to simply not participate, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the intended design of the system, plus if I drop out, getting back in later is that much harder. In the case of (b) (spreading out by category), I feel like this is something we might experiment with. So perhaps the first quarter of each year is NFT and DeFi quarter. The second quarter is Infrastucture and Identity quarter. The third quarter is X and Y quarter\u2026and so on. In this way, any individual project would only have to focus once a year and have more time to focus on a clear messaging/marketing strategy. Also, each project would be competing in a smaller \u201cworld\u201d, so the donors might more easily find projects that they might not find otherwise. Also, the matching fund donors could \u2018specialize\u2019 and only match funds for particular categories more easily. I\u2019ve made these suggestions earlier, and I understand that momentum is a powerful thing, but I make this post to gauge whether anyone else is experiencing this \u2018donor/donation fatigue\u2019 that I, and maybe parts of my community, are feeling. As always, my comments are intended to be helpful, not critical, so I hope they are taken that way. Cheers. ",

I don\u2019t agree about running specific themes once a year, it puts teams at a significant disadvantage if their timelines don\u2019t match the schedule. Having the grants round is also a stewardship opportunity to feed back to the community that supported you. One way the regular charity world gets around the repeated ask problem is to sign people up for monthly recurring donations. I think many donors would be happy to say \u201cI\u2019ll give $2 every grants round automatically\u201d. We would just need to add that funcitonality. I like the idea of categories to highlight project themes or two enable better searching (it\u2019s much easier to say, I want to support projects based in Africa and have a category for it rather than scanning all of the projects), while leaving the round open to anyone to participate. Donors also tend to give small amounts each round because of the matching.

                    "content": "Thanks, Anne. I tend to agree with you the on the sentiment. One of the intentions when we first set the quarterly cadence was to ensure a project could be funded with a Gitcoin Grant for as long as they were active. The Gitcoin Core team has had an internal metric of trying to grow the number of grants that receive more than $5K USD in funding per round. This $5K number has been a watermark for whether or not funding received was sufficient to \u201cchange a dev\u2019s life\u201d and enable them to build and work on their project in the open web. I worry that any lower in frequency (less than quarterly rounds), we may see accountability of projects drop off. We already have problems where folks get funds to do something and then don\u2019t deliver. Having accountability checks but once a year seems like it would perpetuate that problem. Also, if someone misses the NFT round by a couple of months, it would be devastating to know they have to wait nearly a year before they would be eligible again. @annika - In the spirit of your question, I wonder if there is an opportunity to smooth some of the funding that has come in from the side rounds too. There were some pretty large matching pool amounts paid and I am wondering if that is a feature or bug. ie, should someone take $250k of a $500k matching pool? IMO, the goal of the matching pools is to encourage work/project development. Having projects get very small matching contributions because another project is getting a large sum is often discouraging. On the same hand, we often tout how successful some projects are based on their large matching fund grant. I am curious to get other\u2019s thoughts here. ",

You could still allow them to use the donation functionality of the platform, just not let them tap into the matching. Accountability is definitely critical.

Historically, different cause rounds or ecosystem rounds have not had a cap, like the main round did of 2.5% in GR12.

Instead, it operates in the Ethereum community, if I understand the official eligibility criteria from Gitcoin\u2019s Fraud, Detection, and Defence workstream. FFD is not just defending the main round against non-human attacks but moreover, e.g., against non-EVM/Ethereum and for-profit projects. I\u2019m not sure these are the specific rules. Still, in any case, there are a bunch of eligibility variables like this. Correct if I\u2019m wrong, @DisruptionJoe and @Sirlupinwatson? If we acknowledge eligibility rules like this, then \u201cmain round\u201d is probably a misleading coining for what\u2019s actually happening. This mismatch most likely increases the number of illegible grant applications, FDD\u2019s workload, confusion for grant recipients and funders, et cetera. Moreover, as @GlenWeyl noted recently, Gitcoin \u201cis not really a global system.\u201d Indeed, the Gitcoin Grants \u201cmain round\u201d is an ecosystem program to fund non-profit Ethereum projects or something along these lines. It\u2019s not a general-purpose program for \u201cpublic goods.\u201d And that\u2019s precisely why we have scaled the main round program so meaningfully. FDD has sufficient knowledge of the Ethereum community structure to apply bespoke mechanisms to police collusion and potential authentication fraud of funders/earners who try to game the system. (In contrast, strategic collusion/identity fraud are inevitable problems that truly global/individualistic Quadratic Funding programs would run into.) In turn, philosophically, we might better embrace and communicate a vision more faithful to what we do: Gitcoin builds ecosystems. Yes, bold notion on the plural. Similarly, the Uniswap grants round we operate is not a \u201cmain\u201d round. Accurately, we\u2019ve been calling that Uniswap program on Gitcoin Grants and similar programs like the \u201cClimate\u201d and \u201cLongevity\u201d rounds \u201cecosystem rounds.\u201d Hence my proposal: Let\u2019s consider rebranding the Gitcoin Grants \u201cmain round\u201d to \u201cEthereum round,\u201d and with that, we can probably get rid of the \u201cmain\u201d versus \u201cecosystem\u201d dichotomies more generally. Also, please allow me to loop in Gitcoin\u2019s Memes, Merch, and Marketing workstream (@seedphrase, @Fred, and @seanmac) because this is very much Grants Round structure marketing territory. ",

A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods proposal was really helpful to learn about public goods and the origin of the idea. Except the equations  My input won\u2019t be specific as much as the inputs above obviously. It can be considered as input about grants structure in general. My first impression of Gitcoin Grants was people place their web3 bullish projects and get funded by bullish web3 funders. As I hear \u201cpublic goods can be anything, it can be fresh air, open source software\u2026\u201d more in the community I researched more. What we want to refer to as public goods is what countries do with our taxes actually. But countries have template for it. Hospitals, schools, parks etc. these are all evolved by time and became like a template for anyone who wants to setup a nation.  In web3, we don\u2019t have such template obviously but we have reasonable amount of people that suffer in traditional world and can leave their input for public goods. I see there was an attempt here to find ideas about public goods. That\u2019s a great start I think but I concerned about how we handle/process the whole thing.  Even some luxury fashion brand send its employees to different countries to design new clothes and create new trends. As we all online, why not regularly collect requests about public goods from related persons/organizations? Similar to the what we previously did but in a massive scale. There may even be a squad for that. Currently, it looks like we left the whole thing to the web3 community. Sounds like dangerous :)) Current structure and our message looks like attracting degen web3 people. I know we try to filter them manually. However, I would split this \u201ccreate grant and get funded\u201d process into two subjects. People who express their request for a public good should be different from people who will actually make it. My point here is to make web3 more familiar with everyone. This way we may have more grants in variety and may slow down eager builders. I see there are categories like infrastructure, dapp, blockchains etc. These all look technical to me. Why don\u2019t we have categories by function such as healthcare, education etc. and user experience can be specific to those categories. I can create some infra tool for education for example. Functional category > Technical category. Each functional category has its own specific needs. So each of them should be handled in its own way. QF is a good idea in general but distribution of funds needs more work I think. I don\u2019t place a specific idea here about that but I know some charity organizations send funds partly on a regular basis.  ",
