                    "content": "For added context I\u2019ll share my experience as I represented DUX team in the aforementioned discussions with the whitehat hacker.  Context In February Immunefi CU notified us of three vulnerability reports that were related to the Governance Portal\u2014one of which was quite clear-cut (ie. not controversial and easy to classify) thus was handled swiftly. The two other reports were more controversial as the whitehat hackers were arguing for the vulnerabilities to be classified as critical, thus warranting a significantly higher payout. As DUX team we disagreed in both instances\u2014for one the impact of the vulnerability would not warrant a critical classification, and for the other the reported vulnerability could only have been exploited in case of a successful breach of a protected GitHub repository (the community repo controlled by GovAlpha). What ensued in both cases: A tiring and endless discussion on the classifications between me and the whitehat hackers, where they had a huge financial incentive to have the reported vulnerabilities be classified as critical. Common sense and/or increasing security of the codebase were not the focus of the discussions\u2014it was all about the classification. The discussions ended up in a gridlock where I asked the Immunefi CU to step in and make the decision, as I did not feel mandated to decide. Although Immunefi CUs decision on both reports are not final yet, it sure looks like the terms/scope described in MIP64 will be leading as opposed to the actual context of these reported vulnerabilities. imo this will result in disproportionate payouts to the whitehat and thus a net-negative for the protocol.  Problem Although we should respect \u2018the rules of the game\u2019 defined by Immunefi, on which these whitehat hackers operate, I do believe that Immunefi CU should be able to iterate on these \u2018rules\u2019 based on experience (such as the aforementioned two reports). imo the goal here is to minimize payouts that were disproportionate to the value of the reported vulnerabilities, and thus maximise the value of this bug bounty program to MakerDAO.     flipflopflapdelegate:  The last thing this DAO wants is for whitehats to start posting tweets on how they were underpaid, and had to go thru a wall to negotiate on the worth of their findings.   Agreed, but let\u2019s not forget that whitehat hackers are financially incentivised actors whose incentives are not (necessarily) aligned with MakerDAO.     Dairyman:  What discretion do you want but don\u2019t have? There\u2019s not any real limits on the spending now, right?   Although I agree that Immunefi CU should be able to iterate on the scope definition/terms based on experience I\u2019m also not sure what that would look like. Which permissions does the CU need in addition to the current mandate? I hope to see those being defined in this discussion, as opposed to running a simple yes/no poll. ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone, Thanks for all the time you\u2019ve spent reviewing this and discussing. I apologize for some confusion as it seems that our intent is misunderstood a bit. With MIP64c2, it\u2019s already part of it that the severity classification system of the program can be modified. This generally comes with a modification of the Impacts in Scope of the bug bounty program as well, but we discovered that this wasn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Accepted Impacts section and we want to make sure that it\u2019s there. There are downsides to this as, for example, we discovered that Injection of text was not clear enough, and so our new severity classification system clarifies that it has to be persistent injection of text since regular injection of text is generally not impactful. In essence, we are learning more about making sure bug bounty programs are clear as Immunefi carries on its existence and we want to take this new knowledge to the MakerDAO bug bounty program. Additionally, MIP64c2 already accounts for steward core unit feedback with reclassificaiton (i.e they can state that for their asset something can be considered Medium instead of High) but this isn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Accepted Impacts section as well. This change doesn\u2019t mean that IS-001 gets to change how any outstanding bug report is handled - because those get considered under the terms that the program had when they were escalated. We are not asking to have the ability to force reclassification of an outstanding bug report after changes are made. Additionally, steward Core Units will be consulted with the changes before they happen so that they can have modifications for the assets for which they are a steward. For example, they can say that Impact A should be downgraded to Medium from High for Asset X. When updating the bug bounty program, we would then make sure this modification is explicit in the program. The modifications can also be very extensive, even to the point of saying that only one specific impact would be accepted in the bug bounty program. I should add that the case being referenced to by DUX is one where this power is actually needed. We want to be able to remove impacts that are not desired, but during the process of the removal we discovered that we do not explicitly have the same amount of flexibility as with the severity classification system. That said, we have indicated restrictions already to the bug bounty program that achieves this in practice, but having text and then adding restrictions for everything is really inefficient and potentially confusing for hackers. It would be best if we could just remove an impact altogether. Lastly, this is also not a request to have IS-001 to have unilateral decision making on the severity of the bug report. What we want is greater clarity and the ability to do so before bug reports are submitted by having explicit freedom of modifying the Accepted Impacts section in coordination with respective steward core units, just like how MIP64c2 already has for the Severity Classification System implemented for the bug bounty program.
