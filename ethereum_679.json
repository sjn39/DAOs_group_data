From the outside looking in, there is a mess of different incentives at play, it is very difficult from a macro level to determine if it is a \u201cnecessary\u201d change to make, even after you dig through the tough technical points of whether it is sound (and it appears sound to me from my limited knowledge in hardware engineering). My points as a skeptic were much broader and more philosophical about whether it was a distraction, but I am with you now that this has a marginal enough boost to network security that it is worth the funding to move forward and protect the diversification of the mining ecosystem. Every time someone calls a skeptic like myself \u201cuninformed\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d, or claims that the proposal is \u201cobvious\u201d, it trips alarm bells in my head that lead me further away from the path to understanding why it is necessary, especially as someone who admittedly has very little hardware design experience to evaluate the proposal. What we need now is more facts and less \u201cprofessional opinions\u201d. I think that\u2019s what gets this across the finish line.  I\u2019m sorry if that is terse or rude, but it has been my experience that people who are for the proposal are getting exasperated instead of being patient and guiding people through it.

Just discounting something because you\u2019ve been called a name doesn\u2019t seem like a good solution either. Maybe people are yelling because they feel strongly about the security of the network and care about their investment in this technology. They see the train rolling down the tracks towards the bridge that has explosives on it. Agreed that it is hard to evaluate. My first reaction to it all was: \u201cWe need to make sure it is 110% necessary\u201d and \u201cWhy is Kristy such a drama queen?\u201d Once I got past that and decided to focus on the tech, it became clear that due to the focus on PoS and a distaste for PoW, a ball had been dropped. That ball is the understanding of the importance of PoW on the current network. Ethash has served well for so long that all the people supporting it are gone now. The deep understanding of the importance of mining and securing the network against 51% attacks, is gone. Miners have been relegated to a necessary evil, which is really the wrong way to look at the people who are securing the network today. At the same time, this has given ASIC manufacturers a chance to catch up with their solutions. The threat of losing the original mission statement of being GPU centric is real, especially now with the crypto winter and thirdening. Profitability is gone and GPU\u2019s are being turned off. Look at the difficulty levels (subtract out the time bomb increase), we are back at 2018 levels\u2026 a whole years worth of added compute power has been shut off. Everyone has had their eye on the PoS ball\u2026 even with the assumption that it\u2019ll just replace PoW. But, fact is that PoW isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. It will be around for years more. It will overlap with PoS for years after that is first released. PoW is not a distraction, a 51% attack is a distraction. It turns out that whatever personal motivations Kristy (or whomever) had to originally work on ProgPoW are not relevant now. The thirdening, crypto winter and Linzhi hastened things to the point of making these the relevant issues. Agreed. More facts. Less opinions. Let\u2019s get WB funded and working ASAP. I\u2019d argue that the EF should reverse their decision and fund these grants. It is embarrassing to effectively have to beg the community to fund this stuff. ",

It usually has the opposite effect on me, hence why my initial reaction to ProgPoW was to move against it, because it raised those types of flags. I agree that there seems to be the best alignment to move forward with it, but only after a personal accounting with my larger concerns that lead to this being a marginal enough benefit to be valuable (instead of an overwhelmingly obvious result).  \u201cASIC resistance\u201d as a concept is disputable, but we don\u2019t have the luxury of disputing it anymore because we can\u2019t guarantee a robust and fair marketplace for development of machines against an \u201cASIC friendly algo\u201d. We also have to be sure we are the top GPU mining coin, and that the value of other GPU coins is not comparable to our own so we remain untouchable by mercenary hash power. There are tons of macro level analysis that trades whether it is worth it to move forward with now, the eventual move to PoS is also something to consider as even though the Phase 3 (final) network is years away, the Phase 0 chain should hopefully launch within the year and we can use it to help secure the chain if we are smart!

The benchmarking will provide insight as to wether the 0.9.2 version of the spec or 0.9.3 version provides a not-too-unbalanced amd/nvidia performance difference, and also help us plan for what to expect on a block transition when the hashes/sec goes down 2x-3x.  (how long to get back to 15s blocks and how much sooner will the ice age be felt). What I want and likely won\u2019t get is some validation that this design will provide the desired limited upside to ASIC implementation.  As someone not trained in hardware the explanation sounds legit, but a corroborating opinion from a qualified neutral party would be better.  It sounds like all the qualified experts will all have conflicts of interest and won\u2019t be considered neutral, or are otherwise unavailable to comment.  I hope I\u2019m wrong on that mark. ",

There are multiple things going on and some of them are directly initiated by the cat herders and some are \u201csupported\u201d as in \u201cwe support what they decided to do\u201d. So as far as the audit goes there are 2 components: benchmarking and examination of how long/efficient a ProgPoW ASIC would be. Benchmarking is done to make sure that there isn\u2019t discrepancy between AMD and Nvidia cards performance. The other examination is to make sure it is even worth it to implement progpow or if ASICs can be made super quickly (like less than 9 months) and with more speed increase. Whiteblock wants to do the benchmarking part, but idk who will pay for it. They are equipped to do that piece of the audit imo. They have both a Bounties Network and Gitcoin bounty for their work. The more difficult part is the 2nd part which deals with figuring out the details of how an asic would be built, how long, and the effeciency increases compared to GPUs. I very recently got in touch with another group that isn\u2019t Whiteblock who wants to do the 2nd part of the audit. Once they have a solid proposal we will likely try to help them set up a Gitcoin or find sources of funding if they are legit. ",

CPUs and GPUs are themselves ASICs. Any algorithm that can run on a commodity ASIC (a CPU or GPU) by definition can have a customized ASIC created for it with slightly less functionality. Some algorithms are intentionally made to be \u201cASIC friendly\u201d - where an ASIC implementation is drastically more efficient than the same algorithm running on general purpose hardware. The protection that this offers when the coin is unknown also makes it an attractive target for a dedicate mining ASIC company as soon as it becomes useful. Therefore, ASIC resistance is: the efficiency difference of specilized hardware versus hardware that has a wider adoption and applicability. A smaller efficiency difference between custom vs general hardware mean higher resistance and a better algorithm. This efficiency difference is the proper metric to use when comparing the quality of PoW algorithms. Efficiency could mean absolute performance, performance per watt, or performance per dollar - they are all highly correlated. If a single entity creates and controls an ASIC that is drastically more efficient, they can gain 51% of the network hashrate and possibly stage an attack. ",
