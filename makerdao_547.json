As far as I know, the policy that most people agreed on is from September 2019 from @Cyrus: \u201cIn short, moving the debt ceiling up in 10 million increments leaving a buffer of 10-20 million is the safe approach IMO.\u201d I think this policy should be either confirmed or modified to reflect the current supply, circumstances (MCD) and to be consistent with the recent decisions of increasing the DC. Regardless of the policy, I want to hear your opinion on what the next ETH debt ceiling should be:     150M 175M 200M 250M more than 250M Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I think @Cyrus or the risk team should decide) Abstain (I think MKR holders should decide) Abstain (I don\u2019t understand the risks) Abstain (Just show me the results)     0 voters     I am doing this signal request for the first time - next time it will be better based on your suggestions  ",

It is important that we make decisions based on an understanding of the risks, rather than by popular demand. In the future, consider making signal polls multiple choice. This has a number of advantages, but mainly it allows people to express support for all acceptable choices, rather than only their favourite choices. This makes it easier to find a consensus option than if everyone can only vote for their favourite choice.  As an example for the second point, I would have liked to vote for both 150M, and also express confidence in the Interim Risk Team to make this decision. EDIT: I thought of a third point.  I feel like it\u2019s good practice to set expectations for how these polls are going to proceed. You\u2019ll notice in some of the other polls, the authors have said something along the lines of: \u2018This will be reviewed/closed on date X.\u2019 I feel like this is useful, and should be done more generally for all signals.

We can use the logic and information they provide us to come up with a number. So my opinion is 150 mil based on what I perceived from Cyrus about keeping a tightish roof. I considered a 175 ceiling, but were currently at 121 mil, a 50 mil gap would be pretty big (41% of current dai supply). ",
