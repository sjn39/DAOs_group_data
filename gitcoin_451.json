I\u2019m not going to discuss AKITA right now just because I don\u2019t want to get bogged down with it, and will instead pick a different example: Snapshot The proposal calls a vote on whether or not there should be multiple communities to support multiple languages, at least as I read it. What would this mean if it passed? Would the Gitcoin team be obligated to implement the portal described in the description? Who would need to do the translations? I suspect there is general confusion over what the DAO can and cannot govern. I know I\u2019m confused about that. I think there should also be some kind of process before proposals go to Snapshot, to review them, make sure they\u2019re clear, make sure what is being voted on is something in the purview of the DAO. I could make a Snapshot proposal voting if pineapple is a legit topping for pizza, but I do not think that pizza toppings are in scope for the DAO, nor can the DAO enforce its decisions on pizza eaters worldwide. I might make that proposal just to make a point. I think this should optimally turn into a concrete suggestion which is then voted on, something like:  a nomination for a review team a decision on what quorum would be needed to put something in Snapshot what a proposal should look like what can and can\u2019t be done with a proposal  ",

I personally would have thought proposals would be well discussed here on discourse before being put on snapshot. Maybe that should be enforced somehow?     wschwab:  What would this mean if it passed? Would the Gitcoin team be obligated to implement the portal described in the description? Who would need to do the translations?   Maybe I should not have assumed this, but I would have thought the people who voted for a proposal would be directly involved, one way or the other, in implementing that proposal. There are examples in the past where issues and new aspects of Gitcoin were organically introduced with minimal involvement from the Gitcoin core team besides maintainer reviews -e.g, mini-clr. I see no reason why not to put in place rule that if you propose something or voted on it, then you should be expected to work on it. I do not know how a review team will work, so I will wait to see more ideas. But I feel that steps for producing a concrete proposal should include the following as part of the discussion period before even going on to snapshot:  A list of committed people who will implement, organise, or manage whatever is being proposed should it be voted into existence A clear timeline if relevant How this will affect other areas in Gitcoin, be it the community, time resources taken away from something else, and overall what effects that are expected in the long or short terms.  If there is a review team, then they would take in consideration all of the above before moving it to snapshot. In my opinion, if a proposal does not have people willing to implement it, organise or manage it into existence once positively voted on, then it is no different than just sending a suggestion the core team or posting on the Github issue explorer expecting someone else to do the work. The only difference here, in such a case, is you just have people voting with their tokens showing their sentiment. Maybe that is the purpose of this DAO, but I think it should be more. ",

I might have not been clear enough: I didn\u2019t mean to equate the two! I think the language proposal is rooted in a very relevant and beneficial idea, whereas the pineapple proposal is not. The only point I was trying to make with the pineapple was that in the current setup, anybody can make any proposal, which makes for a chaotic Snapshot situation. The point I was trying to make with the multi-language proposal was not limited to it, nor a specific criticism of it. If anything, I was more familiar with it because I\u2019m trying to follow the different threads discussing (in English) the creation of subcommunities around language since it appears to me to be very needed. I think the same point can be made about a number of proposals, including the recent 7-option proposal which I didn\u2019t want to single out because I thought there was a non-trivial chance of the thread getting thrown off course. To directly comment on your bullet points, I think your first lines up with mine, I think the second (timeline) is a valuable addition, and same with the third. Apologies if I came across as disrespectful of the multi-lingual proposal! I think Gitcoin needs something like it, and look forward to seeing it. ",

So in short, topics on the forum can lead to formal workstreams, which lead to formal proposals, which lead to snapshot votes, all within around a week. This has been added to the process document here:     GTC Governance v0 \ud83e\udd16 Meta-Governance       This document is a suggested process for developing and advancing Gitcoin Community Proposals. It is a living document intended to be owned, modified and enforced by stewards and the overall community.  Before we get started, please note that if you have support questions,  our Discord here is the place to ask, comments not related to the proposal in this thread will be removed:     Governance Roles Right now there are two main roles in Gitcoin governance: stewards and delegates.  Becoming a ste\u2026     The general confusion over what the DAO can and can\u2019t govern definitely needs to be resolved and I\u2019d argue that\u2019s an even trickier question. Right now, Gitcoin Grants related topics are the main scope but anyone can propose other topics if they so choose and try to steer the community in that direction at will, so long as they fit into an existing workstream. I\u2019d love to see hard rules implemented on what to do with topics that extend beyond existing workstreams.

I wish I had the capacity to take lead on this, but unfortunately I simply don\u2019t right now. I can offer being a part of the process and trying to help streamline wherever I can, but in terms of actually getting the people and getting it off the ground, I don\u2019t think I can spearhead it. One potential suggestion to get this going would be getting the top 5 delegates to champion this. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the level of delegation they have received is a fair proxy for saying they have community trust, and that their positions as Stewards makes it fair for them to convene about this.

I think a vetting process like what @wschwab is proposing is the solution for the current problem. If raising the GTC to make proposals is needed in the future, then for sure, at that time let us do that. I do not know how it would look after people become more active in workstreams and earn more GTC, but perhaps at that time we can see what the average amount of GTC people have, and raise the limit to that. For now, I think we should not rise the barrier too high. Vetting proposals is the best solution at the moment I think. ",
