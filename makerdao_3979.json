Welcome to our Meet your Delegate #3. We have had two of these so far, with some of our Recognised Delegates. This week, we have two of our soon-to-be Recognised Delegates: Monet-Supply and Gauntlet.   Monet-Supply  Presentation 01:02  Intro965\u00d7539 53.2 KB   Delegate Platform960\u00d7541 105 KB   Conflicts963\u00d7541 104 KB   Discussion 10:10  Payton Rose: In terms of being on the Risk team, how would you handle a situation where you may feel differently than how the Risk team is advising the DAO?  11:32  Payton Rose: In terms of growing Dai supply but also being aware of regulators and working with them, how do you feel about RWAs at Maker?  14:24  Chris Cameron (from chat): What are your priorities when Maker enters into a business relationship with another entity, for example, B.Protocol, Centrifuge, Deco Protocol, etc?  16:49  LongForWisdom: In the future, the portfolio of assets that backs Dai, how do you see that breakdown looking between RWAs, decentralized assets, potentially centralized stablecoins? What do you want to see for that?  21:10  Seth Goldfarb: LongForWisdom has done a really good job outlining the potential benefits of implementing delegation. I see some risks as well, mostly around the potential formation of political parties. Do you see any risks with the introduction of delegation and if so what do you see yourself doing either on your own or with other delegates to mitigate these risks?  24:52  LongForWisdom: Do have any thoughts or opinions on scaling the DAO itself as an organization? Is there anything we should be doing better, anything that we are currently doing that we could improve, etc?  27:40  LongForWisdom: Any contact information where people can reach out?   Nick Cannon from Gauntlet Elite Growth  Presentation 28:38  Gauntlet logo600\u00d7600 829 Bytes   Discussion 32:55  David Utrobin: You mentioned you are also a delegate for Compound and Uniswap, what goes through your mind or decision-making process when there are conflicting proposals and things at play between these protocols?  34:26  LongForWisdom: You mentioned how you would abstain from votes that you thought were recharged or people were caring a lot about. From a delegate\u2019s perspective, why should someone delegate to you who only votes in a subset of proposals versus another delegate who says they would vote in all the proposals as I think makes the most sense?  35:43  Payton Rose: How do you plan to communicate your reasoning for votes to the Maker community and how much participation can we expect from the Gauntlet team at general Maker calls?  37:10  Payton Rose: Did you have a plan on how you would communicate why you voted on each proposal? Is that going to be done on the forum, are you on Twitter\u2026?  38:02  David Utrobin: I think it is so interesting that there are delegates who are proposing themselves as individuals and some of them as a team like Gauntlet. Maybe the individual who is actually doing the votes changes but the background, expertise, insight, and work you guys do will definitely improve the quality of your activity. I wanted to express my gratitude for you putting up a delegate platform!  38:44  Chris Cameron (from chat): What are your priorities when Maker enters into a business relationship with another entity, for example, B.Protocol, Centrifuge, Deco Protocol, etc?  40:04  Payton Rose: Is Gauntlet compensated at other delegation things for their vote delegation work? Do you expect the same to come true for Maker?  40:52  Frank Cruz: How would you reason about expanding Dai to other L1s? If we get five Gauntlets to be the top five Maker delegates, how do you think that would evolve when it comes to gradual decentralization?  44:23  Someone (from chat): What is the purpose of MakerDAO?  45:20  LongForWisdom: You talked a lot about the quantitative risk stuff, but there are a lot of internal DAO things that happen as well and stuff that affects the Protocol. One of the big things is onboarding CUs. We have onboarded many CUs in the last months and there are still proposals coming in, so it looks like we will continue to vote on onboarding other CUs. Is that an area where Gauntlet would abstain as you have described or is that something that you will attempt to quantifiably analyse to figure out how valuable these CUs are to the Protocol?  47:35  Seth Goldfarb: There are potential benefits of implementing delegation. I see some risks as well, mostly around the potential formation of political parties. Do you see any risks with the introduction of delegation and if so what do you see yourself doing either on your own or with other delegates to mitigate these risks?  50:22  LongForWisdom: For people that are less familiar with the work you do, could you briefly go over what it is that you do for revenue? How do you make profits, and do you think any of these things will conflict with voting in MakerDAO?  51:42  LongForWisdom: You did some work for the Maker protocol before, would you be incentivized to vote to do things that the Maker protocol might employ you to audit?  53:22  Seth Goldfarb: I have a vague picture of how you can apply the financial modeling to things like system parameters, but can you explain how you might apply the modeling to issues around governance?  55:14  LongForWisdom: Any last call-outs or highlights you want to finish off with? Any preferred methods for contact?   Closing Comment  LongForWisdom  Outro 55:59  Thank you very much for coming! Looking forward to having discussions with both of you in the future. Thanks to everyone else for coming as well and I will hopefully see you in the next one!   Credits   @gala produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.
