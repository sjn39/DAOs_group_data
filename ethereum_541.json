After some discussion, the group had consensus that:  Any storage protocol should be supported The protocol should be identifiable w/o additional context  The latest proposal for the ENS resolver is now EIP1577. It uses a new contenthash field, which supports multiaddr, and calls for deprecation of the content and multihash fields. @decanus and @Arachnid have updated PublicResolver.sol, and I\u2019d like to propose that the Ethereum providers plan to add support for this new EIP in the coming weeks. Should be a trivial change, and we can maintain backwards compatibility for DApps using the content field (rare, to my knowledge) until EOY. DApps moving to IPFS or Swarm will be able to follow this standard from the start. Thoughts @p0s @marcgarreau @bitpshr? ",
