                    "content": "Project Name: Thales Author Name: padzank Defillama TVL (at snapshot): $256,168 Transactions/day (at snapshot): 152 Tier: 3 Optimism native: Yes Revisions to metrics used: N/A Number of OP tokens to claim: 900,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0x489863b61C625a15C74FB4C21486baCb4A3937AB Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): As one of the first projects on Optimism and as an Optimism-first project, Thales has a direct interest in the overall success of Optimism. By receiving an allocation from the $OP governance fund, Thales will seek to increase not only its own user base, but the adoption of the entire Optimism ecosystem as well. How will the tokens be distributed? Thales\u2019 $OP distribution will be forward looking. The goal is to reward the usage of Thales products, liquidity providers for the THALES token and builders that are building on top of the Thales protocol. Thales Protocol products usage Amount: 495,000 $OP (55% of allocation) Dynamics: 40% (360,000 $OP) towards Thales products users and 15% (135,000 $OP tokens) as bonus rewards for protocol users that are also THALES stakers at the same time. Motivation: Thales has already brought a plethora of products to the Optimism network while even more still being in development:  Positional markets AMM - The flagship product of Thales. A novel and unique AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Positional Markets trading around various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets. Thales Royale - On-chain battle royale experience using Thales Market resolution mechanisms with evolving utility NFTs on Optimism as player profiles. Exotic Parimutuel Markets - Optimistically created and resolvable Exotic Parimutuel Markets, allowing anyone to create a parimutuel market around any fathomable event. Sport markets AMM - Upcoming decentralized and permissionless on-chain markets around Sport events. Sports data provided by Chainlink exclusively for Thales on Optimism network. Ranged markets AMM - Upcoming AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Ranged Markets, where anyone can position themselves on any specific price range of various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets.  It\u2019s vital for the Thales protocol to improve the adoption and usage of these products. Thales has seen organic growth in its user count without paying any incentives, in parallel with the overall growth of the Optimism network adoption. Thales Protocol plans to use the majority of OP token allocation as a powerful incentive for people to try out and participate in the aforementioned novel products. The goal is to increase the protocols exposure and interest towards these products by devising a system of incentives and show the world what the Thales Protocol is capable of in the best way possible. The overall plan is to distribute the Protocol Usage part through direct trading or participating incentives and as prize pools for Trading Competitions that will be organized during the distribution period. Additionally, Thales\u2019 inherently low risk of wash trading makes Protocol Usage part of distribution safe against any attempt of gaming the system. The way the Thales AMM works is that there is a Skew Impact mechanism that is put in place to incentivize keeping the AMM as market neutral as possible by adjusting the price premium of UP/DOWN tokens based on the amount of risk that the AMM is exposed to. The additional side effect of this is that it is not economically feasible for a trader on Thales to be market neutral against the Thales AMM while driving volume at the same time. Thales Protocol has the luxury of keeping this spread between BUY and SELL prices active across markets as our product offers really novel and exotic exposure towards supported assets based on probability calculations and traders are willing to accept it as they deem their risk/reward ratio favorable either way. Thales Protocol already has a Gamified Staking system in place that awards THALES stakers with additional bonus rewards of up to +30% of THALES token rewards if the staker is also using Thales products up to a certain threshold. With this in mind, there will also be an opportunity to earn a higher allocation of $OP tokens as Thales protocol user, if you are also a staker of the THALES token. The bonus rewards will be directly correlated to the amount of THALES tokens staked and certain thresholds of personal Thales protocol usage. This way, the users who are more inline with the Thales protocol and are staking, will be awarded with more OP tokens compared to if they were using the protocol without having any staked THALES tokens. THALES/ETH Liquidity Providers Amount: 315,000 OP tokens (35% of allocation) Dynamics: Emit 15,750 OP tokens weekly for 20 weeks towards \u0446THALES/ETH LP token stakers Motivation: The majority of THALES token liquidity and utility has been migrated from L1 Mainnet to Optimism network during Q1 2022. Even with LP incentives from the Thales Treasury, THALES token liquidity depth on Optimism never managed to reach satisfactory levels. To further incentivize deep THALES token liquidity on Optimism, Thales plans to use a portion of the OP token allocation as rewards for THALES/ETH Liquidity Providers. This would run in parallel with the currently running LP incentives program of 45,000 THALES tokens weekly. Builders on Thales Amount: 90,000 OP tokens (10% of the allocation) Dynamics: Ad Hoc Motivation: Allocation of 90,000 $OP tokens, or 10% of entire Thales protocol Phase 0 allocation, are to be used for incentivising campaigns that invite new users to Optimism via the Thales protocol and grants to builders building products or utilities leveraging Thales contracts. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? More Active Optimism Users With Thales providing incentives both in OP and THALES tokens for trying out and using novel and fun products that are exclusively available on the Optimism network, we are confident that this will benefit the adoption of Optimism in a significant way. With five separate Thales products living on Optimism, each catering to a different category of users, there is a significant likelihood of high user retention. Incentivized Liquidity Transition By having incentives in place for staking THALES tokens and providing THALES/ETH liquidity, we are drawing in more liquidity from other networks onto the Optimism network. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The biggest challenge for introducing new users to the Optimism network is to actually get them to bridge over their first funds and try out the protocol. After stepping into the fast, affordable and stable environment of Optimism and after trying out the quality, fun and novel products of the Thales Protocol, we are confident that new users will decide to stick around and continue to organically use the Thales products for their own benefit, even after the incentives run out. The OP token incentives are just a slight nudge to gain the attention of new users, getting them to bridge over funds for the first time and to get them accustomed to using Thales and Optimism.  From having no direct incentives and with limited beta-phase liquidity, Thales Positional Markets managed to garner a significant showcase of organic demand. The number of unique users, total volume and daily trades are on an uptrend. This can be correlated with the global increase of Optimism users and projections point towards further growth with the introduction of the OP token incentives. Minuscule amounts of gas needed for trading on Thales, when compared to L1 gas fees, will also make new traders feel more \u201clike home\u201d and increase the likelihood of them becoming a permanent resident of the Thales Protocol and the Optimism network. With present incentives for providing liquidity and staking the THALES token on top, combined with all additional incentives that will be in place from other Optimism ecosystem projects, Thales will be contributing to not just long term user retention but also large scale liquidity retention. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The target for distributing staking and liquidity provider incentives is around 5 months, while the distribution of protocol usage incentives will be depending on the timeline of releases of upcoming Thales products and on the type of mechanism for the distribution. As we approach the launch of the OP token, these intricacies will manifest more clearly as the Thales Core Contributors work together with the Thales Council to devise the best and safest possible system for protocol usage incentives, spread across various Thales products. How much will your project match in co-incentives? In regards to THALES token staking and LP incentives, Thales will continue with its in-house incentive programs to run in parallel with the new OP token incentives. The current program equates to 30,000 THALES distributed weekly to THALES stakers that are also using the protocol and driving volume, and 45,000 THALES distributed weekly to THALES/ETH liquidity providers. In time, these programs are subject to change at the discretion of the Thales Council. Additionally, it is expected that Thales Treasury continues to take part in protocol usage incentive programs in parallel with the OP token incentives. ",

With this subsequent Phase 1 proposal, Thales will request additional distribution of OP tokens to sufficiently bootstrap the usage of all relevant Thales products on the Optimism network that also have a large potential in increasing the overall adoption of the Optimism network. For example, one major product of Thales is going live on mainnet in the upcoming weeks from writing this proposal: Thales and Chainlink will bring world\u2019s first on-chain Sports Markets AMM exclusively to the Optimism network called The Overtime Markets.  overtime1269\u00d7807 151 KB  Thales was one of the first whitelisted protocols to launch on Optimism mainnet. All main protocol token operations and products are done exclusively on Optimism. THALES token is the first token to support Tipbot.cc integration with Optimism and deposits/withdrawals from a CEX (MEXC) directly to Optimism. Thales is also delivering a major effort towards making the onboarding process to Thales, and hence the Optimism network, as frictionless as possible for Thales dapp users. In the upcoming days, Thales dapp is integrating a direct fiat onramp to Optimism, bridge+swap aggregator and cex-to-Optimism solution. Thales users will be able to onboard without ever leaving the dapp, making a comfortable environment for easy onboarding to Optimism.  PHASE111334\u00d7889 120 KB  Thales architecture offers novel and unique cutting-edge products around price movement of crypto assets, price ranges of crypto assets, automated on-demand markets around Sports Events, permissionless prediction markets and sequential on-chain battle royale experience. While these products are exclusive to the Thales protocol because of its unique on-chain resolution architecture, that means they are also exclusive to the Optimism network as well. If users wish to use these products, they have to onboard the Optimism network first. Incentivising Thales product usage is in the mutual interest of both Thales and Optimism. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? The distribution goal is to mainly incentivize the usage of Thales products through direct trading/participation incentives and trading competitions. Aim is to draw new attention to the Optimism network and the Thales products, as the products have a high potential of capturing and onboarding a wide demographic of users that are not exclusively crypto native from the start. Additional goal is to additionally incentivise THALES/ETH liquidity provision and to have a healthy fund for grants towards builders building on top of the Thales protocol. We are positive that incentives are key towards getting users familiar with the simplicity of novel trading methods using Thales products, which are also primed to have successful user retention numbers after the direct incentives dry up. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Large part of distribution will be allocated throughout the Thales products as direct trading incentives in tandem with organised trading competitions. As incentives invite new users and participants to try out these products, subsequent results will be the increase of trading volume, TVL, transaction count and, most importantly, user retention. The following are Thales products that are planned to receive participation/trading incentives:  Positional markets AMM - The flagship product of Thales. A novel and unique AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Positional Markets trading around various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets. Thales Royale - On-chain battle royale experience using Thales Market resolution mechanisms with evolving utility NFTs on Optimism as player profiles. Exotic Parimutuel Markets - Optimistically created and resolvable Exotic Parimutuel Markets, allowing anyone to create a parimutuel market around any fathomable event. Sport markets AMM - Upcoming decentralized and permissionless on-chain markets around Sport events. Sports data provided by Chainlink exclusively for Thales on Optimism network. Ranged markets AMM - Upcoming AMM-based trading framework allowing for on-demand Ranged Markets, where anyone can position themselves on any specific price range of various Chainlink and TWAP oracle based assets. Thales Referrals Program - On-chain incentivized user acquisition and onboarding tool. If someone uses your Referral Link to start trading on Thales, you as a referrer get a percentage from each trade, paid in sUSD directly. This way, everyone has a direct incentive to onboard as many new users to Thales as possible and benefit from their trading volume.  Another portion of the distribution will go towards incentivising THALES/ETH liquidity providers on the Optimism Network. These incentives will subsequently increase the TVL of THALES and ETH liquidity and they will also complement the increase in trading activity and txn count of the products through the reflexive mechanism of Gamified Staking rewards. Gamified Staking is a system that awards THALES token stakers with additional bonus rewards if the staker is also using Thales products up to a certain threshold. This specific system is designed to align THALES stakers with the usage of the products themselves, and vice versa. The final portion of the distribution will go towards a Grant program that awards third-party builders on Thales. The protocol architecture is designed in such an elegant and novel way that there is an infinite amount of cool ideas and products possible on top of the Thales core architecture. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? As previously stated, The OP token incentives are just a slight nudge to gain the attention of new users, getting them to bridge over funds for the first time and to get them accustomed to using Thales products on a cheap, fast and reliable Layer 2 network that is Optimism. The goal is to get as many people as possible to try out Thales products. We are confident that the simplicity of Thales products is friendly for all kinds of users, fun and not possible on any other protocol because of the novel mechanics Thales introduced to the space. Users just need to get over the first onboarding step and do the first few trades/positions to get acquainted with the simplicity of mechanics and that is what the incentives are here for. Incentives for providing liquidity and staking the THALES token on top, combined with all additional incentives that will be in place from other Optimism ecosystem projects, Thales will be contributing to not just long term user retention but also large scale liquidity retention. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Tokens are planned to be distributed over a 12 months period of time from the moment of receiving them. This planned timeline has the potential to reassure the users of longevity of incentives and also give the protocol enough time to mature and transition to purely organic volume accrual and increase in user count. <h2How much will your project match in co-incentives? The THALES project will match the OP token incentives across all points of distribution with the continuation of in-house incentives that are already present. The quantity of matched THALES token rewards will be subject to adjustments during this time, from the Thales Council, depending on the initial data gathering of user participation. ",

We also don\u2019t want to reward any project that rushes to spend their Phase 0 allocation just so they can begin the Phase 1 dialogue faster. Let\u2019s evaluate the concrete proposal.  Is it a unique offering likely to draw in many new users to Optimism? Yes, on-chain sports markets are novel and noteworthy. Same goes for the other products listed. Are the funds reasonably allocated over time and products? Yes, the distribution is to take place over a full year and encompassing a wide range of distinct products i.e. catering to a wide range of users.  = Yes from my side. I suggest reviewers comment specifically on the proposal. If a reviewer\u2019s conclusion is to shut down the proposal because the early stage OP is in (i.e. Phase 0 distributions are yet to be distributed), that\u2019s really a separate conversation affecting the entire ecosystem and therefore beyond the scope of Thales\u2019 proposal.

And then I have 3 points that I believe should reinforce this as a no-brainer yes for Thales to be granted the tokens being discussed here.  \"The Optimism Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to growing the Optimism Collective. Not only are we writing software that scales Ethereum technology, we are also scaling Ethereum values by creating the rails for highly impactful projects that don\u2019t have a business model to succeed.\"  The single most important aspect of realizing this vision is getting tokens/economic value into the hands of the right people, so that results can be delivered. I love Optimism\u2019s take here because it is essentially saying\u2026 we know we can\u2019t do it all, so here is the platform\u2026builders - go build - and we will make sure the dedicated ones can keep going financially. It\u2019s very wise IMO. Thales is a small protocol, OP native, and has shown tremendous responsiveness, drive and ambition to demonstrate all the things Optimism stands for. I am naturally inclined to be 100% supportive of this request - and for anyone against it, also would remind you that there are larger protocols - Uniswap as 1 example, that didn\u2019t even bother to write an initial proposal by the due date if I recall correctly. Not that this is a terrible offense by them in any way, and also not singling out Uni either - but more so attempting to clearly demonstrate where priorities are\u2026 and it is actions like this that are revealing without a doubt. You want to incentivize growth? Tokens should be going to hungry protocols that have demonstrated a desire and capability of enabling growth on Optimism, as @padzank has shown here. Also I think it is important to keep in mind there have not been any distributions yet - although they are coming (soon I believe/hope) - of Phase 0 grants and so if we go down this route, by opposing this, you are really saying all Phase 1 OP protocols are essentially irrelevant right now. I would take the opposing view considering Arbitrum is absorbing massive TVL as these words are being written\u2026that now would be the exact time that any clearly dedicated and committed protocol should be awarded tokens to help them grow, whether it be Thales or another similar protocol. All things considered, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing for pretty much anyone since the Optimism launch by any means and I think we can all agree on that\u2026 I believe this proposal to be perfectly reasonable. I would also anticipate the Optimism Foundation to also respect and encourage more behavior like this demonstrated by Thales - it is one of the main reasons I became optimistic on Optimism in the first place: Thales, and so anything that would impede further growth seems counter-intuitive to me. I\u2019m completely in favor of this and again would even suggest some urgency be applied as well, due to the current state of markets. Great proposal, well written and Thales is certainly deserving of every bit of this in my opinion. Weston Nelson    ",

Comments regarding size of phase 0 grants (not that protocols had any influence on it) should be made in the associated phase 0 thread so as to not convolute this thread. No protocol has anything to show for efficacy of Phase 0 grants - they haven\u2019t been distributed yet, so there\u2019s no point in debating that further. If so, we should shut down all Phase 1 applications over the next many months. There\u2019s a chicken-and-egg issue associated with looking at current users to determine grant size. The whole point of the grant is to draw in new users, so I suggest we look at the existing and upcoming products and why they may or may not bring in newcomers to Optimism. That is essentially what Padzank\u2019s write-up is concerned with. Ultimately, the question we need to ask ourselves is whether we believe Thales\u2019 products and their associated OP incentives will draw in substantial users to Optimism. I think there\u2019s a good case to be made for that being the case in light of the novelty of the products in a crypto context (e.g. sports market with Chainlink feeds).  ",

Thales is rolling out new features and products that are truly industry firsts and I see massive potential here not just for Thales but the entire Optimism eco. Everything is and has been based on Optimism and this plan to use Phase 0 as well as Phase 1 OP rewards would be extremely valuable to accelerate adoption. In the very near term Thales will be releasing products such as Overtime that will very likely change a multi-billion dollar industry, but will require mainstream adoption of blockchain to reach the truly stratospheric levels, but can be done. This will result in unprecedented volume flowing in to Optimism. Thales/Exotic Markets/Overtime are just the base layer and just getting going. These are some of the most innovative and well planned protocols out there. Plus, the most decentralized and in-line with the ethos of Optimism. I am in full support and expect this to be a major catalyst for Optimism. ",

Also, liquidity (mining) incentives are one way to grow the ecosystem in the short-term but we do not see much value-add in co-incentivizing a specific project pair.

(Maybe a month now or so) - but they have NOT - been sent to the team. As in, 0 $OP tokens have been sent to the Thales protocol yet. It literally takes a click of a button to accomplish this so at this point I really have no idea as to what to issue is from the administrative side of things getting the $OP tokens sent. Not only this but in the time that has since passed, Thales could have been using the $OP tokens to produce some powerful results IMO. I have subscribed to real-time alerts for this specific wallet address that Thales reauested their original allocation be sent to on Optimism using Forta, and with 100% certainty I can tell you there has not been a distribution to them. There appears a serious disconnect between the voters/protocols/users/Optimism when you think about what I am sharing here\u2026 Anyways, my post was just to make sure you were indeed aware of this fact and hopefully we can find a better way to iterate on this process because at this point I truly don\u2019t think anyone would say it is working very well (the process in place).

Phase 1 largely relates to a new product suite (Sports AMM) which is launching shortly and may as well have been released by a separate protocol. It is the first chainlink-driven sportsmarket AMM ever, and it\u2019s launching on Optimism! If that\u2019s not conducive to bringing in new users, I don\u2019t know what is. Moreover, Phase 0 rewards haven\u2019t even been received yet. I understand the reasoning behind wanting to see the outcome of Phase 0 rewards before approving Phase 1, but it comes with a high cost to momentum. Launching the first Sports AMM ever with Phase 1 grants is a powerful way to bring new users over to Optimism. ",
