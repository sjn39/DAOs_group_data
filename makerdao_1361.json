Summary Should the stability fee for Gelato UNI .05% collateral be raised from 0 to 5 basis points. The GUNI .05% vault type is at/near record highs. With 570,392,000 DAI issued from this vault type, it seems obvious that Maker should begin getting some revenue for it. After discussion with others, I am signaling to raise the stability fee for this vault type from 0% to .05%. Annualized from current levels, that is 285,000 DAI in revenue. The main reason to institute a small fee is that Maker derives no revenue from it currently, demand is very high, and the token itself is revenue generating and can support some amount of fee. The main reason not to charge a fee is that it might negatively impact DAI supply from this vault type.    Raise fees to 5 basis points on GUNI .05% collateral type?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll was closed early because I withdrew this signal request ",
