As I tried to work out how this would work, I produced this document. All mistakes are mine, and the credit is theirs. I\u2019m posting this now because @monet-supply and @0xToes are steering the conversation towards NFTs again, so it might be helpful.  *** THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS, highlighted with a * on each step ***  Advantages  Users can now use any token (NFT, non-approved ERC20s, or any other item that might be auctioned) to mint Dai Possibility of becoming a major player in the NFT marketplace   Challenges  A huge distraction if the market is not big enough Double-collateralization of Dai is capital inefficient The auction system cannot be anything short from great for users to use it   Diagram  1600\u00d7618 87.1 KB   Process  Step 1 Ana  deposits a token (the token is locked until the auction date). defines an auction finish date.* defines the accepted collateral type(s) for the auction.* defines a minimum offer.* defines a \u201cbuy now\u201d price?* defines an auction finish date.*   Step 2 Bob  bids on the token (the collateral is locked until the auction date). cannot unlock the token unless he is outbid. can withdraw bid if no debt has been incurred by Ana*   Step 3 Ana  can mint Dai, based on:  current highest bid current collateralization ratio current Dai / Eth price     On Auction Date  Auction Successful  Ana accepts the highest bid.* Bob gets the token.

Bob gets the collateral back.   Before Auction Date  Vault becomes undercollateralized  Ana\u2019s debt position becomes undercollateralized (based on the value of the highest bid). Ana keeps the Dai. Bob gets the token. The collateral goes to auction.   * denotes open questions Others than the ones highlighted during the process:  Is Maker taking a fee on the auction?  ",

Bob is essentially replacing some collateral that we don\u2019t trust so much (an NFT) with something we trust much more (like ETH). So there needs to be some mechanism to reward that, can be either (or both)  Always have an auction, in which case Bob is rewarded by potentially getting the NFT at a low price - problem with this is that Ana might not want to sell the NFT, they might just want credit against it. Divert some/most of the stability fee to Bob.  Borrow fee generally would be quite high for NFT\u2019s I imagine. Actually, you could make it so it is an element used for bidding. Maker can set a minimum stability fee it will accept alongside a minimum CR for the type of collateral tokens Bob provides. Bob\u2019s can then offer Ana bids consisting of a combination of Stability Fees and Collateralization Ratio. This gives Ana the flexibility to tune for minimal fees versus minimal credit. Ana could take a small amount of credit for low fees, or a large amount for high fees. Something like that anyway. ",

Instead Ana pays Bob some portion of the stability fee.   Bob probably needs to include a length of time in his offer after which either Ana returns the DAI and he gets his ETH back or gets the NFT. Unlike regular vaults, Bob will not want to take on the risk that the NFT maintains its value in ETH terms indefinitely. It also seems reasonable to let Bob keep any fees exceeding the ETH stability fee since our risk is the same? Then, maybe Ana\u2019s stability fee will just be pegged to the ETH stability fee (with some multiplier) to ensure Bob doesn\u2019t get screwed if we change SF on ETH vaults. Finally, I guess it\u2019s worth mentioning that during Emergency Shutdown, Bob gets the NFT and Ana gets the remaining ETH. I really like that this avoids NFT oracle issues! Also, that it\u2019s Ana and Bob instead of Alice and Bob  ",
