Magicians, please review and comment!  \u201cThis proposal serves to describe more clearly the present process for acceptance and implementation of Core EIPs, while also proposing a more concrete process for non-core EIPs. This serves to alleviate EIP editor workload in cases where manual approval is not necessary, and ensures that outstanding pull requests will all represent work required by the editors, making it easier to identify what actions are required, and making the approval process more transparent to users.\u201d  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/956  Concerns that need to get resolved. (We can create new topics for these if necessary.)  For Standards Track Non-Core EIPs, the current EIP states that only one implementation is needed for the author to request a final call on the EIP. There are objections, pointing out that standards should require more than one implementation to be considered final. See the discussion.  ",
