Now that we are generating a lot of fee income from USDC vaults (and more coming), we need to enable liquidations to make sure the fee income is paid.  Also the 13% liquidation penalty could be a large source of income for MKR.   I would think this would be straightforward to do.  What is holding us back? ",

I guess there was no time to develop a reliable USDC oracle at the time of the USDC launch - but is it possible to do it now? I understand that liquidating USDC vaults incures loss for the system but  that is no excuse for allowing even bigger losses in the future. We have some surplus so it\u2019s a loss or not depending on your viewpoint. What\u2019s the status of the USDC liquidations? Are they disabled (meaning that it requires just one executive vote to enable them) or unsupported (requires coding)? ",
