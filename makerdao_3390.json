With the Foundation soon to dissolve and the DAO\u2019s realization of full decentralized management on the horizon, it\u2019s time for the Maker community to determine the direction of development grants. Read more about our grant recipients\u2019 success and what we\u2019ve learned on the MakerDAO blog. As one last act and in order to support community requests to create a formal DAO grants program, Community Development will submit a Call for Proposals for Grants. Anyone interested in exploring how MakerDAO may cultivate a grants program can propose their ideas for review by the community in the Call for Proposals. Community Development sends heartfelt thanks to its grantees, partners, applicants, and community members who have been involved in this journey! ",
