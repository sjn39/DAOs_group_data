While the Foundation releases a fantastic general weekly recap, we feel a governance-focused summary will be useful for delegates and voters due to the rapid pace of governance news and updates. When appropriate we\u2019ll also note a few specific areas for action on timely subjects. Within our weekly recap, we\u2019ll provide a look back at:  Proposals Governance changes Impactful operating suggestions, and Critical governance-related discussions across Discourse, Twitter, and Discord.  The recap is intended to provide an overview of what\u2019s happening in governance and easy access to the most critical information\u2014so that it\u2019s easy to stay up-to-date and make informed decisions. The first recap will be posted today. We\u2019d love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you have! ",

                    "content": " Week of August 15, 2022 TL;DR: Optimism is in the midst of a reflection period and considering significant updates to the governance process. See below for all the details.  Summary A brief recap of where we\u2019re at (it\u2019s been busy!):  Season 1 of Optimism Governance voting ended on August 3rd with Voting Cycle #4. We entered the second week of a reflection period during which ideas about and feedback on the governance process have been actively solicited. A special Voting Cycle #5 will be held from August 25 through September 7 to vote on proposed governance process improvements. Season 2 will begin on September 8 with Voting Cycle #6, which will enact any governance improvements passed in the previous cycle. See this governance update from @ben-chain for a full review.   Proposed Changes  Operating Manual Optimism\u2019s Operating Manual, which describes the mechanics of the governance process, is being updated by the Foundation in response to observations made and feedback received. Draft v0.2,  will go into effect with Season 2. Among the many changes contemplated:  switching from a two-week to a three-week voting cycle increasing to two the number of delegate approvals needed for a proposal to move to a vote changing the quorum from 10% to 30% of votable $OP supply   This is the time to provide feedback on the draft if you haven\u2019t already.  Proposal Template A new grant proposal template has also been put forward by the Foundation during this reflection period. The draft template incorporates a number of suggestions from the community and should make the merits of each proposal easier to assess.  Provide your feedback here.  Governance Committees In response to observations made of Season 1 and in keeping with their experimental spirit, the Optimism Foundation has proposed the use of Governance Committees in Season 2. The committees (five in different areas are suggested) are meant to help distribute the work of assessing proposals, which has been overwhelming, particularly for delegates.  The details of committee formation and responsibility are worth an attentive read. Proposals for committees are to follow a specific template and will be voted upon in special Voting Cycle #5 (which opens this week, on August 25). Here are the committee proposals that have been put forward:   @katie\u2019s proposal for a DeFi committee.  @Gonna.eth\u2019s Committee Proposal for DeFi  @MoneyManDoug\u2019s proposal for a DeFi committee  @Krzkaczor\u2019s proposal for a tooling committee Plus, a query from @OPUser about the utility of a \u201cconflict committee\u201d   In The Forums   Delegate updates: The Delegate Updates Thread collects communications directly from a number (currently six) of active Optimism delegates.  Delegate commitments: Keep your eye on this thread to learn more about each delegate.  Valuable observations: @raho and @tnorm provide productive commentary on Season 1 of the Governance Fund. They\u2019ve also created a spreadsheet that tracks the participation rate (among other things) of the top 50 delegates.  Pause for decentralization? @polynya suggests pausing Governance Fund voting cycles until \u201cminimum viable decentralization\u201d is achieved.  OP for gas? Long thread about whether to switch OP from being a governance token.   On Governance Calls Governance calls are an excellent way to stay up-to-date and contribute:   @katie is organizing and hosting bi-weekly governance calls, and they\u2019re open to anyone. Recordings of the first call and the second call are available. The next call is scheduled for August 30.   Download the .ics file, import it to your calendar, and read the previous call notes here.  On Twitter   Delegate dashboard: Michael Silbering points us to Optimism\u2019s dashboard on Dune.  Poor participation: @polynya argues that delegate participation \u201cis getting very low.\u201d  Token transfers: The Optimism Foundation explains recent $OP transfers from a multisig.  #OPSummer is heating up!

                    "content": " Week of August 22, 2022  Summary Season 1 has ended, and the reflection period is over. Welcome to Voting Cycle #5, which began on August 25 and runs through September 7 (7PM GMT). This is a special, two-week cycle dedicated to proposals meant to improve Optimism governance processes.  Proposals We have five proposals up for voting, each one for a Governance Committee (the purposes of which are described in full here):   @katie\u2019s proposal for a DeFi committee  @Gonna.eth\u2019s Committee Proposal for DeFi  @MoneyManDoug\u2019s proposal for a DeFi committee  @Krzkaczor\u2019s proposal for a tooling committee  @jrocki.eth\u2019s proposal for an NFT & gaming committee  Up to four committees will be approved for Voting Cycle #6. Committee proposals must first reach quorum, and then be approved by majority vote; the top four proposals that have met these thresholds will be implemented for the next cycle. Keep in mind that this could mean that fewer than four committees will be in place.  Vote now! (on Snapshot or on Boardroom) Season 2: Voting Cycle #6 begins on September 8 (7PM GMT) and will run for three weeks until September 28 (7PM GMT). The revised Operating Manual will go into effect with this Cycle; read through it carefully and take note of changes.  Provide your feedback on Governance Fund proposals being drafted for Cycle #6.  In Discord There\u2019s a new gov-temp-check channel with a bot that makes it easy to post your proposal for a temp-check. Should delegates vote for themselves? @millie asks whether delegates who are on the proposed committees above should be voting for themselves\u2014with all the voting power delegated to them.  In the Forums What about the self-delegation of tokens received in grants? @Defi_LATAM_axlvaz raises important questions (some of which were previously raised) about a recent case of self-delegation, and the discussion that follows reveals different stances about how a governance token like $OP should (and shouldn\u2019t) be used. The revised grant proposal template, which is now in effect, states that \u201cthe expectation is that token grants will not be self-delegated for use in governance\u201d; but if you plan to self-delegate, \u201cthis should be made clear in your grant proposal along with your reasoning.\u201d Debate on the potential effect and utility of governance committees continues. The committees are an experiment for Season 2, at which point they will be re-evaluated.  On Twitter The Optimism Foundation took stock: Check out the OP Summer thread here, read the summary, and examine the dashboard of ecosystem programs funded so far.  Governance Calls Calls are held bi-weekly. Put them on your calendar.  Join the next call, on Tuesday, August 30 (5PM GMT).

Remember that the new proposal template is now in effect, as are the new procedures outlined in the updated Operating Manual.  Proposals There are five proposals up for voting in Cycle #5, which ends this Wednesday, September 7 (7PM GMT). Each one is for a Governance Committee; the top four Governance Committees will begin their work with Voting Cycle #6 \u2014 later this week!  DeFi Committee [Group A] DeFi Committee [Group B] DeFi Committee [Group C]  Tooling & Infrastructure Committee [Group A]  NFT & Gaming Committee [Group A]   There\u2019s still time to vote on Snapshot or on Boardroom. Over 9,000 wallets have voted for each proposal so far   A new proposal rhythm will begin with Voting Cycle #6, following a three-week pattern as described in the Operating Manual:  Week 1: proposals labeled [Draft] are posted in the forum for community feedback (there\u2019s also a dedicated temp-check channel in Discord). Week 2: Delegate feedback. Two delegates with >0.5% of the current votable token supply must explicitly indicate approval of a given proposal in the relevant discussion thread in order for the proposal to move to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread in the forum. Week 3: Voting. Proposals in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread that meet the above requirements will be moved to Snapshot for voting.  As per the Operating Manual: \u201cEach \u2018week\u2019 runs from Wednesday at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) until Tuesday at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).\u201d The quorum threshold for Governance Fund (Phase 1) is now 30% of votable $OP supply. The approval threshold is 51%.  Provide your feedback on Governance Fund proposals being drafted for Cycle #6.  In Discord Given the high number of delegates implicated in the Governance Committee proposals for Cycle #5, Reformed_Normie asks whether \u201cabstain\u201d votes count towards quorum. @diligit pointed out in the forum that the answer should be specified in the Manual.  In the Forums Soulbound badges in Optimism? @0xbendo (from Otterspace) makes the suggestion. This recalls the \u201ccrown for delegates\u201d discussion \u2014 an idea to make it clear which forum participants are delegates with >.5% of voting power. See recent updates from @Bobbay_StableLab and @GFXlabs in the collection of delegate communications threads.  On Twitter @linda put up a poll asking whether DAO delegates should vote on proposals when there is a potential (disclosed) conflict of interest, and then observes some of the possible drawbacks to abstaining. Boardroom spoke with @fig and @GFXlabs about their proposal for a DeFi Governance Committee in the latest Roundup (brief proposal discussion begins around minute five).

                    "content": " Week of September 5, 2022  Summary We\u2019re now in the first week of Voting Cycle #6, with new proposals being crafted and set before the community. @ben-chain has summarized governance process changes from the reflection period and Voting Cycle #5, re-iterated the purpose and goals of the Governance Fund, and provided a look ahead to the full Season 2. Four Governance Committees have been established and will begin their work this Cycle. @lavande has provided guidance for the committees. Expect feedback from each committee before the third day of third week of this Cycle; committees will post their recommendations in dedicated threads, such as this one. This week\u2019s governance call (Tuesday, September 13, 5PM GMT) may include discussion of how the committees will distribute their work.  Proposals A number of proposals have been submitted for community review \u2014 collected in this thread. Those proposals that are marked \u201c[Review]\u201d by this Tuesday, 7PM GMT will enter the second week of the Cycle, which consists of delegate feedback. A retrospective and brief analysis of proposals approved in Season 1 has been posted by @jackanorak.  Provide your feedback on Governance Fund proposals being drafted for this Cycle.  In the Forums A serious, lengthy, and at times heated debate about Governance Committees took place in the forums and on Discord. It concerned, among other things, the level of expertise needed to participate fruitfully in committees, whether someone should be able to serve on more than one committee, and whether proposed committee members should or should not have abstained from voting on committee proposals.  Keep questions and considerations in mind as we proceed through Season 2. Governance Committees are an experiment limited (for the moment) to this Season, after which the community will reflect on their utility. Should protocols be discouraged from borrowing against their granted OP? @diligit asks that we use the filters on the the delegate information page to promote \u201cdiversification of voting power and more decentralization.\u201d  In Discord A quick overview of Season 2 Cycles and dates is provided by @lavande. There were issues in Voting Cycle #5 with certain multi-sig wallets not being able to cast their votes, and questions about how votes not counted would have affected the outcome. Given the above problem, there were requests to approve all five proposed Governance Committees. The Optimism Foundation ultimately decided to stay with the original plan of four committees, as explained fully here. Here\u2019s another good discussion among delegates about whether those who were on proposed Governance Committees should or should not have abstained from voting on committees.  On Twitter   Optimists are in Berlin for @dappcon_berlin and ETHBerlin. Here\u2019s where they\u2019ll be. The URL for the list of OP Summer incentives programs has changed.   Governance Calls  Join the next call, hosted by @michael, on September 13 (5PM GMT). The agenda is posted in this thread.

Here\u2019s a handy Google calendar for Optimism governance, created by @bobby. Need to review the proposal and voting cycle process? The Operating Manual is the ultimate source of information concerning governance procedures.  Keep an eye out for Governance Committee recommendations this week, and be prepared to vote on proposals that have made it into the Voting Cycle #6 Roundup thread.  Proposals Roundup: At the time of writing there are two proposals that have made it into the Voting Cycle #6 Roundup thread, which is reserved for those that have received explicit approval from two delegates with >.5% voting power. dHedge: dHedge describes itself as the \u201conly decentralized asset management platform currently on Optimism.\u201d This revised proposal asks for 350k OP to split across DHPT (dHEDGE Pool Token) Incentives (70%) and Liquidity Mining (30%) over the course of six months. Otterspace: Otterspace is \u201cbuilding a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use non-transferable NFTs\u201d (Badges), which have a number of different uses. The proposal asks for 100k OP, 70% of which would be used to incentivize user adoption, onboarding users to Optimism \u201cwith enough funds to mint their first badge and experiment with a few other transactions on Optimism.\u201d The remaining 30% would be used to incentivize integration partner adoption.  Provide your feedback on Governance Fund proposals being drafted for this Cycle (the relevant ones are tagged \u201ccycle 6\u201d).  In the Forums Report: State of Optimism Governance. @tnorm and @raho from Messari have written up this insightful report, which reflects back on Season 1. A helpful proposal process flowchart was posted by @OPUser in their delegate communication thread. Anti-rug pull suggestion: @ovetta wonders whether a phased rollout of funds to grantees, as they reach successive milestones, might be worthwhile. The grant proposal template was updated to include a field that asks the proposer to identify the voting cycle they are participating in. Aelin Protocl GF Phase 0 Token Distribution. @OPUser has raised the question of whether the protocol has significantly changed how it had proposed to deploy the 900K OP it received.  In Discord Optimism will be re-organizing the forum and moving it to a self-hosted site. Here\u2019s a productive discussion among Governance Committee delegates about how to sort proposals to review, and at what stage to review them. Governance Committee channels: the Tooling committee as well as DeFi committees A and C have dedicated discussion channels.  Check in on the #gov-temp-check channel to respond to proposals looking for feedback.  On Twitter This week in Optimism. Introducing OP Radio, a weekly Twitter Spaces event \u201ccovering a wide range of topics in the Optimism ecosystem.\u201d First on deck, @qx_app, on Wednesday, September 21, 3PM GMT. \u201cWTF is retroactive public goods funding?\u201d @binji_x lays it out. @flipsidecrypto highlights this Optimism dashboard by @SocioCrypto. (And, separately, all Optimism data has been backfilled at Flipside: \u201cqueries are now fully supported, from beginning to end infinity.\u201d)  Governance Calls The most recent call has been summarized by @michael. The conversation was lively, and included such topics as how the Foundation will handle voting problems going forward, creating the governance culture we want to create, and how the two DeFi Governance Committees will split their assessment work.  Keep your eyes peeled for details about the next call, which will be on September 27.

There was a flurry of activity (and some confusion) as teams got their proposals ready to be included in the Roundup and the newly formed Governance Committees got to work. Some proposals didn\u2019t make it in time for this Cycle, but you can still take a look at what\u2019s being put forward for the next Cycle.  Proposals Summaries of the dHedge and Otterspace proposals were in included in last week\u2019s recap (see above); here are summaries of the remaining eight: Across Protocol claims to be \u201cthe fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge between L1 and L2s.\u201d With this proposal Across asks for 750k OP, 75% of which will be used to \u201csubsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to Optimism.\u201d The remaining portion will be allocated as a reward to anyone who operates a relayer on Optimism. Across will also provide up to 320% ACX as a co-incentive for those bridging to Optimism. Across believes that the proposed incentive programs could create from $500m to $1b of volume on Optimism. Bankless Academy describes itself as a \u201cfree-to-access, open-source, education hyper-structure seeking to empower internet society with the information and tools necessary to achieve financial self-sovereignty.\u201d The Academy does this by creating lessons or \u201cquests\u201d that guide the user through the experience of using progressively more complex web3/crypto tools and platforms. This proposal asks for 33,000 $OP, 60% of which will be distributed to contributors building the lessons for onboarding Academy users to Layer 2s (including Optimism); the remainder will go to the community treasury to support future development of the Academy. Interest Protocol, from GFX Labs, ****is as a \u201cfractional reserve, overcollateralized borrowing protocol.\u201d Deployment to Optimism is predicted in the \u201cimmediate future\u201d should the grant be approved. Importantly, \u201cInterest Protocol is designed to allow tokens held as collateral to still be able to participate in governance via delegation controlled by the user,\u201d meaning OP holders could use the protocol without losing their ability to participate in Optimism governance. The proposal requests 31,764 OP to provide 50% of estimated developer costs to deploy the protocol on Optimism. Interest Protocol would then be able to accept OP as collateral, creating a \u201cdemand sink\u201d for the token without sacrificing the token holder\u2019s ability participate in governance. The Kromatika dApp was first active on Optimism in December of 2021 and is one of the few (if not the only) DEX protocols with automated limit orders and a swap aggregator on Optimism. As the proposal states, \u201cDEX trading is complicated, expensive and is limited in terms of convenience when compared to CEX trading. Kromatika hopes to solve this problem for the Optimism Ecosystem.\u201d Kromatika\u2019s goal is to make \u201cDEX trading simple, accessible, and affordable on Ethereum L1 and L2\u2019s.\u201d The proposal asks for 300k OP. OptiChads is focused on \u201cimproving Health & Wellness in Web3 through our art. We have a very active and passionate community of Chads focused on self improvement in and out of the gym.\u201d The proposal asks for 50k OP, 100% of which will be used to incentivize health and wellness behaviors through the use of Web3 quests. As a co-incentive, 50 OptiChad NFTs will be given to the addresses with the highest completion rate. The Revert Compoundor, created by Revert Labs, automates the compounding of fees for liquidity providers on Uniswap V3 \u2014 a function that can substantially improve returns for the user. The proposal asks for 240k OP to incentivize users to bring liquidity to Uniswap on Optimism (estimated to increase by ~20m USD) via the Compoundor. 100% of OP incentives will go to Compoundor liquidity providers over the course of three months. \u201cSocket is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains.\u201d The project aims to create \u201cseamless user onboarding,\u201d which is, as the proposal describes in detail, often complicated, onerous, and expensive. One million OP are requested, 60% of which would be used to subsidize 90% of fees for every user that onboards to Optimism via Socket. The remaining 40% is allocated to builders that integrate Socket into their UX or their dApps. Tarot is a decentralized lending and leveraged yield farming protocol that has been on Optimism since May of 2022. This proposal, which was initially introduced in mid July, requests 600k OP, 90% of which will be \u201callocated to liquidity bribes and incentivization mechanisms on Velodrome, Beethoven X, and/or other major DEXs on Optimism to incentivize TAROT-based liquidity.\u201d The remaining 10% is allocated to the Tarot team, which will pair the OP with TAROT to provide initial liquidity on Optimism for a minimum of 12 months.  Check out the Governance Committee Recommendations concerning the above proposals:  DeFi Committee A  DeFi Committee C  NFT & Gaming Committee Tooling Committee   Vote now! \u2014 voting is live only until September 28, 7PM GMT. That\u2019s Wednesday.  In the Forums Shadow Governance Committee: DeFi Committee B, which is not an official Governance Committee, has posted its recommendations, which are \u201cjust suggestions that we hope are coming from a helpful, informed perspective.\u201d This has been, unsurprisingly, controversial. Delegate communication. @polynya has updated their thread, outlining their approach to the new season. Another delegate commitment. @Tjark, on behalf of a collective of PoolTogether community members, has laid out their delegate case. A grant update from PoolTogether, \u201cthe front door to defi on Optimism,\u201d has been posted by @Leighton. Proposals for retroactive public goods funding. @Jonas has posted some recommendations for the next experiment.  In Discord Lots of discussion in #gov-general about seeking delegate feedback and approval. Formally signaling that a proposal is ready for the voting cycle is not an indication of a delegate\u2019s endorsement of the proposal itself. Should Governance Committee recommendations be posted earlier in the voting cycle? In the future, Governance Committee recommendations may be linked to in Snapshot. New and improved Gov docs have been put out there, incorporating feedback.  Check in on the #gov-temp-check channel to respond to proposals looking for feedback.  On Twitter This week in Optimism. OP Radio is a weekly Twitter Spaces event \u201ccovering a wide range of topics in the Optimism ecosystem\u201d \u2014 every Wednesday at 3PM GMT.

In Discord Do delegates have to explain when they vote against a Governance Committee recommendation? Resubmitting a proposal for Cycle #8 after changes have been made requires getting delegate approval again. Delegates to submit solutions to GitHub: See @lavande\u2019s post detailing an experiment to have delegates submit PRs for solutions to the last-minute-change-to-an-already-approved-proposal problem. Can OP received via governance fund grants be sold to fund development and R&D, if so stated in a proposal? Snapshot issues persist for some voters.

Governance Committees will be issuing their recommendations for all the proposals that will be up for voting beginning on Thursday, November 3 at 7pm GMT. Keep your eye on delegate communication threads as well. The #gov-general channel in Discord exploded last week, until @lavande stepped in and provided guidance. The Optimism Foundation is working on an \u201cenforceable delegate code of conduct\u201d; in the meantime, we should be adhering to the Discord and forum codes of conduct.  Proposals  Check out all the proposals in the Voting Cycle #8 Roundup Thread. Voting begins later this week.  In the Forums Season 2 Feedback Thread. Contribute constructive thoughts here ahead of the upcoming Reflection Period. Lots of insight shared already. Discursive health of DAOs. Here\u2019s a brief research survey to complete, about governance. Synthetix and Phase 0 delegation. This continuing thread is both contentious and important for OP governance. Take a read. Concerns about OP governance. @ScaleWeb3 provides some thoughts and an analogy: \u201cThe lack of meaningful governance activity in this governance delegate model and the cartelization/oligopoly around grants reminded us of a good old article: Lisk - the mafia blockchain.\u201d  In Discord If you have the capacity, dive into the #gov-general exchanges from this week. Then go outside and touch grass.  Check in on the #gov-temp-check channel to respond to proposals looking for feedback.  On Twitter Optimists at ETHSanFrancisco \u2014 see here. This week in Optimism and @jinglejamOP on this episode of OP Radio. What are the top apps on Optimism? 15k OP up for grabs in this metaverse hackathon.  Governance Calls A recording of the most recent Governance Call can be found here. There was an excellent presentation by @haonan and @MSilb7 dissecting the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the Governance Fund so far.  The next call is scheduled for November 8.

These two have seen record voter engagement so far, with over 20k wallets participating at the time of writing. Voting ends on December 21. Also important: Optimism governance will be transitioning to on-chain voting for Season 3. And even more important! The Optimism Foundation recently announced the first iteration of the Citizens\u2019 House.  Related: Token House badge-holder nominations are due by December 14 (20:00 UTC).  Proposals Grants Council (Snapshot | Discussion). This proposal intends to establish a Grants Council \u2014 made up of a council lead working together with eight reviewers \u2014 to manage the Governance Fund proposal process. Governance Committees will no longer be in place; instead the Council \u201cwill have full decision making authority as to which grants are made.\u201d If this proposal is approved, the Optimism Foundation will select the Council Lead while delegates will vote for the eight council reviewers (who must self-nominate). Reviewers on the Council will be split into two sub-committees: The Growth Experiments Sub-Committee and the Builders Sub-Committee. The Council will have a total seasonal budget of 5 million OP; budgets will need to be approved by delegates each season \u2014 if the Council itself proves a worthwhile evolution of Optimism governance. Protocol Delegation Program (Snapshot | Discussion). This proposal seeks to address the controversial protocol self-delegation issue by temporarily delegating a certain amount of \u201cidle\u201d tokens from the Governance Fund to protocols according to a specific criterion. This criterion is \u201cdesigned to be simple, objective, not easily gameable, and applicable across protocols\u201d: total gas fees generated on Optimism during the preceding Season. Multipliers and certain other important conditions detailed in the proposal. The maximum amount of OP a protocol can be delegated is 2 million (e.g. if a protocol already has 2 million in delegated OP, they will not receive any more through this program). Up to 15 protocols will be selected according the above criterion. An additional eight protocols may self-nominate to receive delegated OP; those self-nominating protocols will be voted on in Voting Cycle #9b \u2014 should this proposal pass.  In the Forums Delegate commitments. Six new ones have been posted since last week. L2BEAT\u2019s new Governance Delegate is @kaereste. Voting power grant proposal. @Jadmat.eth-DefiLatam suggests a framework for proposers who want to self-delegate granted OP. More on on-chain. @rshuel from a16z provides insight about on-chain governance.  In Discord Data from a Dune dashboard will be used to identify the protocols eligible for the delegation program (see proposal above).  On Twitter This week in Optimism. It was a big one. Gitcoin hosted a Twitter Spaces convo about Optimism\u2019s retroPGF round. And a thread on the same RPGF Round 2 by the Optimism Foundation.
