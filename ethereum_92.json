I feel the example for why separate functions are used for add and remove can be strengthened. \u201cthe token holder shall be able to add someone else as a lien holder but the lien holder of that token\u201d seems incomplete. Have you considered hasOtherLiens(\u2026) for a lien holder to check if it is the last lien?  In some lending cases to increase credit for the backed asset, the lender already knows the lien that they have put on the asset. They also like to know if there are other liens placed against the asset. The comment says \u201camount of debt\u201d shall be its own EIP. Do you have a draft for that? I feel these two might have to go hand-in-hand or go out as one EIP. ",
