                    "content": "Updated 8/8/2022: The following proposal was edited to include Steward feedback, including formatting and language changes. The proposal was also edited to include additional OKRs for Community Experience and Community Governance. Additionally, one KR was removed from the Support initiative.  Essential Intent During S15, DAO Operations will focus its initiatives on delivering results that support the following Essential Intents (EI) of the DAO:  DAO Organization Financial Sustainability Protocol Adoption Program Success   TL;DR Over the last 2 seasons, DAO Ops\u2019 ambitions were focused on building a service-oriented team with the right expertise to advise and support our fellow workstreams. On the whole, those efforts are producing results, especially in the areas of cross stream strategic planning, budgeting and decision making. One notable example of this is CSDO\u2019s adoption of the DAO\u2019s Purpose and Essential Intents, a leadership and community process that was facilitated by DAO Ops. In S15, we have scaled back some initiatives and teams (i.e., accounting, people operations, and support) in an effort to reduce costs, and focus our attention on the DAO\u2019s most important core functions and pivot to a protocol future. We see our overarching priorities as twofold:  Rebuild trust with workstreams by delivering results that are immediately helpful to them and the DAO as a whole, and Building a habit of accountability throughout DAO Ops that facilitates focused delivery of initiative goals.  Though this season\u2019s budget cuts were taken out of necessity, we recognize this season as an opportunity to focus our attention on service excellence in a few areas.  Amount DAO Ops will not request new funds from the DAO treasury to fund our workstream in S15. Instead, we will use the excess funds in our multisig to fund approximately $293K in total costs for the season. This total spend is 25% lower from the budget spent in S14, and 52% lower than the requested S14 budget. All surplus funds beyond our funding needs, representing roughly $270K USD, will be returned to the treasury. Note: The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send the requested $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.  Milestone Report Legend   Success  Incomplete, will hit goal or priority change  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled - out of workstream\u2019s control     Initiative/Dept Objectives Past Season Value Delivered     Accounting & Finance    Scale accounting operations ensure timely payments and treasury diversification within workstreams. - Onboarded Moonshot and PGF to budget and payment tools to support DAO-wide spend reporting.     Ensured 15% of DAO Ops S14 budget was traded into stables to manage volatility; advised interested workstreams on strategies.      (New): Increased the number of exchanges that have GTC listed.   Community Experience   Streamline contributor onboarding process with clearer entry points, support CSDO, and set high standards for community management. New bi-weekly CSDO strategy call and updated weekly tactical (or \u2018action\u2019) call is improving the DAO\u2019s executive decision making.     Fractionalized Community Lead role was filled by two existing contributors, saving time and money while also offering a strong result.   Community Governance   Support steward participation via enhanced information flow. Updated budget proposal process, standardized workstream deliverables and (hopefully) reduced cognitive load for stewards.     Re-engagement of pledges for stewardship in the governance forum are fostering increased engagement, communication and context.   Tooling   Improve community tooling, increase community adoption, service DAO infrastructure, and provide enhanced security. Created guidance and facilitated training sessions for new and existing contributors.     Tooling has completed the asset transfer from Holdings to the DAO.     Created additional permissions and processes to secure Notion, Discord, and GSuites.     Contributor tooling support occurs within 24 hours.   People Ops   Improve the hiring experience, and provide clear, accessible People Ops guidance. Launched the People Ops Hub as an easy-to-find resource for forkable talent guidance to workstreams.     Published parental leave guidance.     Contributor work agreements are ready to sign.     New partnership with WorkDAO for employee benefits is in the final negotiation stage.   People Ops   Scale the peer review and role documentation to support additional contributors. New framework for role documentation ensures that contributors consistently practice accountability to team mates and role definition in alignment with DAO needs.     As of S14, nearly 100% of core and trusted contributors received peer feedback.   Support    Rebuild the user support team and improve its performance. Hired Support Lead mid-season.     Launched training series to professionalize service.     Updated and created new knowledge base articles.    Funds Spent to Date (current and projected) During S14, DAO Ops spent an estimated $377K in S14. This estimate includes May and June actuals ($256K) and our projected spend for the month of July ($121K). We estimate roughly $750K USD is currently available to roll over into S15. This is in excess of our funding needed for the season. Misses, Direction Changes, and Lessons Learned In light of the broader market conditions, throughout S14, DAO Ops looked for ways to protect the DAO treasury from unnecessary spending. The result of those efforts was the addition of only one new hire instead of the three full-time hires projected at the beginning of the season. Some key learnings and changes in direction below:   Treasury Management Lead Hire: In S14, DAO Ops opted to prioritize treasury efforts currently in our control over hiring a new Treasury Lead.   Hiring & Onboarding Flow: We decided to put our onboarding efforts on hold while we evaluate and begin to define the impact we hope to make with the community onboarding experience (with other workstream partners). As a result, we did not onboard or track new community members through the existing onboarding flow. Our S15 community experience objectives are reflective of the time our team spent consulting our workstream partners to form a more inclusive and engaging community strategy.   Documented Accounting Guidance: Due in part to legal considerations and to not run afoul of money transmitter laws, published financial guidance will be put on hold until a time where the DAO has fulsome legal recommendation from counsel on the topic.    Season 15 Commitments Initiative Commitments     Initiative Essential Intent Objectives Key Results     Community Experience DAO Organization, Protocol Adoption,Program Success Increase engagement and satisfaction among DAO Citizens interested in our grants program or grants protocol. KR1: Increase the average weekly percentage of engaged citizens on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.      KR2: 50% reduction in requests to change Discord logic when compared to S14.    DAO Organization Develop a strong \u201cWhy\u201d for community management initiatives that aligns with the DAO\u2019s Purpose. KR1: Support the MMM community engagement strategy through weekly syncs, with insights from seasonal community management audits.      KR2: Identify and document the community and Discord needs of each workstream.    DAO Organization Continuing to improve how we work at CSDO level. KR1: Adopt a streamlined budget process ahead of S16.      KR2: Improve the quality of cross stream meeting processes, and the documentation of reviewed and adopted proposals.   Community Governance DAO Organization Improve community governance and steward engagement through simplified processes that streamline decision making for the largest GTC delegates.

KR3:  80% of stewards and workstream leads view steward meeting structure, pacing and content favorably.      KR4: 80% of top stewards vote on 100% of formal S15 proposals.   People Ops DAO Organization Ensure contributors are in the right roles, and embrace a DAO-native hiring approach that further develops well supported contributors. KR1: 100% of core and trusted contributors have received a quarterly peer review.   People Ops DAO Organization Empower DAO contributors to grow and support our  ImpactDAO and protocol development.

Tooling DAO Organization Ensure a coordinated and transparent software tooling approach. KR1: Deliver a recommendation for cost reductions based on a deep dive into all tools used by DAO.      KR2: Facilitate access to all control domain requests within 48 hours.      KR3: Ensure that all workstreams can use Notion as their primary tool for meeting notes and outward facing workstream description by end of season.   Support Program Success, Protocol Adoption Continue to implement processes that improve our grants rounds and supports our transition to a protocol-focused DAO. KR1: During GR15, support tickets (Discord+Email) are resolved within 20 hours (on average).      KR2: Current state of the Grants program and protocol development is reflected on KB within 10 business days of changes.      KR3: Deliver easily used data to grants round workstream partner post-GR15.

Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  DAO Ops is not asking for any funds from the treasury to fund our workstream and its initiatives for S15. We will have a surplus of roughly $270K USD to be sent back to the treasury, depending on the spot price.   1- I can read that you will not request any budget for S15 and you are going to send back 270k into the treasury, what are the transaction fees for this specific amount to revert it back, did you made any simulation (Not sure how you will handle back this amount at this point, which tool are you using etc.?) And why are you not keeping it for S16 at this point?     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  Total Requested from Treasury   2- Moving down in the draft, I see \u201cTotal Requested from Treasury\u201d I\u2019m a little bit confused here, are you requesting any funds or not for S15?     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  KR2: 100% of core and trusted contributors have received a quarterly peer review   3- Since Loie she\u2019s leaving the DAO, is there still a budget allocated to the People Ops part (Peer Review) or you are planning on onboarding a new contributor for this task specifically?     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  Includes severance, parental leave and travel expenses totaling roughly $46K. The rest of reserves will be used for transition costs between seasons (i.e. delay in budget approval).   4- Close to 200k will be used for severance, parental leave and travel expenses? Is there a way that we can break down these separately? Really curious to know and understand how much we are spending on each of those.     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  Budget for 1/4th of 80 contributors, budgeted for 2K budget.   5- 1/4 of 80 contributor is 20, are you budgeting 2k each? This amount would be then 40k? I understand this is simply a draft at this point, but I\u2019m preparing my question for tomorrow in advance   Thank you very much for your answers, really appreciate it! ",

We haven\u2019t dug into fees just yet, but in terms of process, the funds would be returned from our multisig to the DAO\u2019s.     Sirlupinwatson:  are you requesting any funds or not for S15?

Sirlupinwatson:  is there still a budget allocated to the People Ops part (Peer Review) or you are planning on onboarding a new contributor for this task specifically?   Yes, budget is allocated and Sandy who is an existing people ops contributor will be supporting this initiative.     Sirlupinwatson:  Close to 200k will be used for severance, parental leave and travel expenses?   Not quite. We\u2019re just noting that we will be using a portion of our reserves to pay severance, parental leave, and cover any travel expenses that arise this season. Severance will cost $29K parental leave ~$7K, and we estimate about $10K in travel expenses. In total, those expense come to $46K, leaving about $149K in reserves.     Sirlupinwatson:  1/4 of 80 contributor is 20, are you budgeting 2k each? This amount would be then 40k?   This was a misstatement on our part. We\u2019ve budgeted a total of $20K for professional development this season (same as last season). The funds will be used to reimburse up to 10 core contributors up to $2K. The budget narrative was edited to reflect reality. Thanks for catching it and looking forward our call later today. ",

That one seems to me to both be really important and a bit vague as stated here so far. One idea - not living in the streams here - would be to have processes set up that checklist releases from GPC (soft or hard gate) to ensure KB articles are updated for example.  Or is that sort of thing already happening? One meta piece of feedback for all of the write-ups is each summary could add at the beginning a context statement such as a bullet point or two:  DAO Ops = X people out of Y people in total across Gitcoin DAO; $X spending out of $Y spending in total across Gitcoin DAO.

Some responses:     epowell101:  I was a little confused by the wording of the second Shared Cross Stream Commitment: \" * Developing Gitcoin\u2019s knowledge base with and evolving the support process to prepare for our protocol future with help from GPC.\" As I understand it, this is preparing to support partners and other users of Grants 2.0 and passport for eg - by collaborating w/ GPC?   We agree with you that this is a bit vague and are considering to even take this out in our integrated proposal (going up on Monday), and integrate shared commitments in the various places, knowing that anything our workstream does is basically shared, as we facilitate all operational processes within the dao. This one specifically belongs under support, where it actually already is mentioned:     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  Current state of the Grants program and protocol development is reflected on KB within 5 business days of changes.   So we do have a process in place here, but it will be optimized over this coming season. More coming soon!      epowell101:  DAO Ops = X people out of Y people in total across Gitcoin DAO; $X spending out of $Y spending in total across Gitcoin DAO.   This is a great suggestion, and we\u2019ve been thinking in this direction. We\u2019ve done this exercise internally for this round during the budget preparation, while doing a peer evaluation. We did not count the people but we did know which part of the \u2018pie\u2019 we are representing, at least for these drafts. To give you an idea of this, this is the current split. Only reason we did not share is because of time lack, so thx so much for asking.   Any other thoughts welcome and appreciate the feedback! ",

                    "content": "    Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  KR1: Increase average weekly engagement on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.   Hey @Jodi_GitcoinDAO I\u2019m a bit late to the party, but I believe this KPI would be more impactful if we shifted the focus. Instead of aiming to increase average weekly engagement by 20%, what if we aimed to increase the percentage of engagement seen by all citizens by 20%? To explain through examples (using hypothetical numbers), if we start with a current population size of 100 and an average of ten weekly engaged citizens (giving us a current engagement metric of 10%): Currently we are aiming for a 20% increase in average weekly engagement, which is a metric that doesn\u2019t account for population growth. If we have 100 citizens and ten are engaged, we aim to have 12 engaged citizens by the end of S15 regardless of how large our citizen population grows (a 20% increase on 10 gets us 12). Getting two more engaged citizens if we double our overall population is easy to achieve and would ultimately reflect a decrease in engagement (down to 6%) I\u2019m proposing we shift this KPI to \u201cIncrease the average weekly percentage of engaged citizens on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.\u201d With this, we can account for the growth of our community in addition to these specific engagement metrics. If our population size stays at 100, our end goal similarly stays at 12 engaged citizens. However, if our population size doubles, our new target will double to match. In a population size of 200, instead of aiming for 12 engaged citizens, we would now aim for 24 engaged citizens, providing that 12% engagement metric increase (up 20% from the hypothetical 10%). To clarify definitions, we would consider the \u201coverall population\u201d as the target audience for the DAO Citizens channels / DAO vibes calls (which would be anyone with either the DAO Citizen or DAO Core role, as aligned with @safder) The goal here is to ensure we scale our ambitions for engagement growth proportionally with our efforts to continue increasing the overall size of our community! I would love to hear other folk\u2019s thoughts. ",

For accounting the cost per workstream should be fairly limited, and keeping this within the workstreams allows for more control and overview on who\u2019s actually requesting payment for what, because the payment controller knows exactly what the team is working on. But also here, we stay open to increase our efforts again in the future if needed. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your support QZ! On our points for improvement:     Fishbiscuit:  what\u2019s the key difference between DAO Visitor, DAO Applicant, and DAO Citizen? Also is there an idealised journey from someone new to Gitcoin to eventually contributing?   Saf and Kyle are continuing to map this out and have just started their check-ins with and audits of the various workstreams, where they can dive in deeper. But the tl;dr for these 3 roles are that they grant you level of access in discord.  Visitors see only support & townsquare. Applicants are people who have indicated they want to become a more active member of the dao but still need to write their application. Citizens are people who have introduced themselves and have been approved, they can now join our weekly dao vibes calls & citizens calls. More on the DAO Citizen role (beyond discord) can be found here       Fishbiscuit:    what has happened to Sobol? An initiative that I\u2019m assuming has already been discontinued. Could we have some perspective on what happened here please?    We do not have anything officially in our commitments on role documentation, as this was not indicated as a priority for this season. However, we will support the DAO here as part of our dao tooling efforts, and will normally be migrating everyone off of sobol into Notion. @puncar will be reaching out to the workstreams for this. The tl;dr on Sobol is that this is probably a too ambitious tool for the basic things we need, and given our limited budget and scaled down team, we will also scale down this project.     Fishbiscuit:  has the onboarding flow changed? @safder I haven\u2019t heard about onboarding calls in some time   Onboarding now starts via the DAO Citizen role, which is a simplified process (see above). We have a monthly call with anyone who applies, next to the weekly DAO Vibes. More to come for sure as we refine this in the coming weeks & months.     Fishbiscuit:    curious about the conversations around WorkDAO and Opolis, legal cover is getting more important these days especially with      .Anyone can reach out to @sandy_gitcoinDAO for support on this - our focus will be most of all on PGF, coming from holdings, but we\u2019re there to support anyone who needs guidance!

I know there have been a lot of hard decisions being made in scaling back to focus on the most critical items, and I very much appreciate the diligence & thoughtfulness in all this work. That said, I do want to call out one thing: I worry the S14 assessment is a bit rose-colored-glasses-y in that there is a lot of green, even in areas the workstream deemed worth scaling back for S15. From my perspective, these areas did struggle a bit to materialize and it was not totally clear to workstreams what DAO Ops would provide. vs. what would be sovereign to workstreams themselves. As a WS lead, my hope for DAO Ops for S15 is that, in the areas of People Ops & Tooling in particular, we can get super clear on what is being worked on centrally within DAO Ops in service to Workstreams, vs. what is up to Workstreams themselves to manage & bring back best practices to the rest of the DAO. We still feel in kind of in-between territory for both of these. ",
