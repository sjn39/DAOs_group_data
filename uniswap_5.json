                    "content": "Since this question is being asked a lot, if your address in ineligible to receive the 400 UNI airdrop, then you didn\u2019t meet the requirement. The requirement was simple: The snapshot for this airdrop was held on September 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC. Anyone who hasn\u2019t used Uniswap before this snapshot is not eligible for the airdrop.  How to claim the UNI You can easily claim your UNI tokens in just a few steps:  Visit the one of the Uniswap trading pages (ETH/USDT example). Connect your ETH wallet. If your wallet is eligible you will see a popup in the Uniswap app (top right corner). Click on \u201cClaim your tokens\u201d and approve the transaction. Don\u2019t forget to set the right gas limit (https://ethgasstation.info/). Currently gas fees are high, myself I used 90,000 gas and 800 GWEI.  That\u2019s it!  More info:  60% of the UNI genesis supply is allocated to Uniswap community members, a quarter of which (15% of total supply) has already been distributed to past users  Token Allocation:  60.00% to Uniswap community members [600,000,000 UNI] 21.51% to team members and future employees with 4-year vesting [215,101,000 UNI] 17.80% to investors with 4-year vesting [178,000,000 UNI] .069% to advisors with 4-year vesting [6,899,000 UNI]  Claiming the airdrop:   15% of UNI  [150,000,000 UNI]  can immediately be claimed by  historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders  based on a snapshot endingSeptember 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC.   49 million UNI  are claimable by historical liquidity providers. The formula accounts for LP liquidity on a per-second basis since the deployment of Uniswap v1, ensuring that rewards are weighted towards LPs that provided liquidity when total liquidity was low.   400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes  ~12,000  addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions \u2014 love you guys.   Have a great day & thanks a lot to the Uniswap team! ",

As far as i understand i am at least elligable for 400 Uni tokens. Because i have used Uniswap before September 2020 (25 August to be exact) and i have done it with two different wallets, TrustWallet and Coinbase Wallet, including the failed transactions there are some successful ones, i can see it on Etherscan. But when i entere either of the two eth addressses of the wallets mentioned above, i get the following message: \"  Address has no available claim \" my ETH addrerses are the following: Coinbase wallet: 0xAc2aa1Bde32129f6037A8Bb1e6BF2CCd878cd0f8 Etherscan:    Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer    Address 0xAc2aa1Bde32129f6037A8Bb1e6BF2CCd878cd0f8 | Etherscan The Address 0xAc2aa1Bde32129f6037A8Bb1e6BF2CCd878cd0f8 page allows users to view transactions, balances, token holdings and transfers of both ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFT) tokens, and analytics.      TrustWallet: 0x07147DEc22E4693cA4444a902A5a0348E7C1eF8E i don\u2019t know why this is issue occurs to me , but i love to get those Uni tokens. it is quite painful to see that you are eligible but can not claime it for a technical issue Could you please help me, many thanks ",

Etherscan should give you insights in how long the transaction will be pending. Personally I used 800 GWEI & 90,000 GAS and it went through fairly quickly. If you need to cancel your transaction because it\u2019d be pending too long, you can send 0 ETH to yourself with e.g. 600 GAS to cancel the transaction (I did so myself as I had this \u2018issue\u2019, check out this post for instructions).

I\u2019ve got 2 questions. 1- In your post, I see that 49 Million UNI is claimable by historical liquidity providers. Is this included in 400 drop or is this an extra amount per wallet? If it\u2019s something extra, how can we claim it? 2- Are there any discussions about changing the eligibility date for the airdrop to the date of the initial announcement? I think UniSwap has got more interactions in the last two months then ever. Don\u2019t you think that should be also rewarded? Again thanks for everything. Great job, and I\u2019m definitely HODLING!  ",

You might just have to add UNI as a custom token if it doesn\u2019t show up (idk which wallet you use). If it\u2019s ledger, then you\u2019re best off accessing them via myetherwallet.com. https://discord.gg/sbPFmQ ",

You would then need to add the Uni token to Metamask which can be done by copying the UNI token address into the token address box found after pressing the \u201cAdd Token\u201d button in Metamask, after you enter this it should then automatically detect the decimal and token name automatically. Press ok and you should be good to go and be able to see your tokens on your Ledger via Metamask. Hope this helps and apologies for so many edits (perfectionist in me making slight corrections again and again)  ",
