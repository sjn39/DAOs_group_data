                    "content": "I have been watching the evolution of COMP farming extremely closely over the last two weeks, and I\u2019m concerned that an upcoming governance change to their protocol could significantly affect the Maker ecosystem. On Friday the balance of power among their collateral assets is going to change dramatically Up until now, Dai has been left out of the COMP farming craze. This is because COMP is currently rewarded to farmers paying/earning the most amount of interest. Because the BAT rate maxes out very high (~37%), BAT farming has been exceedingly popular. By comparison, at 100% utilization rate, Dai only pays 15% interest. Under the new rules, COMP will be allocated to every dollar borrowed, as opposed to interest paid. This means that farmers will now try to borrow the most amount of money, and will naturally try to pay the least amount of interest. My expectation is that the two most popular farming assets will be USDC and Dai due to the shapes of their (attractive) interest rate curves. While USDC is easier and safer to farm (fixed oracle price of 1, larger supply, larger potential supply, greater liquidity), Dai will earn more COMP up to a 98% utilization rate. Above 98%, USDC does technically become slightly more attractive but I think that is somewhat irrelevant. DAI Interest rate curve Screen Shot 2020-06-29 at 3.52.45 PM1000\u00d71038 35.5 KB USDC Interest rate curve Screen Shot 2020-06-29 at 3.54.17 PM996\u00d71020 37.5 KB There are more or less two types of COMP farmers: natural Dai holders and natural ETH holders.  Natural Dai holders currently hold roughly 130 million Dai (total Dai supply). The optimal tactic for these people is to deposit Dai into Compound, borrow Dai, re-deposit, etc. This recursive loop can gain up to 4x leverage. In other words, 1 million Dai can create 4 million cDai (earning plenty of COMP). Additionally, there is only a very tiny liquidity / liquidation risk here. As long as you cover your interest rate payments, you bear basically no price risk. Many farmers are natural ETH holders. They will first deposit ETH, borrow Dai, and then re-supply and go through the loop. These farmers carry liquidation risk (if ETH crashes, or if Dai spikes up). If they are also re-suppliers (what I call \u2018double-dippers\u2019) then they also face liquidity risk (cannot withdraw Dai if the utilization rate stays at 100%). Single-dippers (merely depositing ETH and borrowing Dai, without re-supplying), can always pay back their loan since they have the Dai sitting in their wallet. Farming is still extremely profitable for single-dippers.  Due to the high APY for COMP farming (circa ~70-100% APY), there is a chance (likelihood, even) that we see an unprecedented demand for Dai. Much of the natural supply for Dai could also be locked up in COMP farming, thinning out sell-side orderbooks. It is almost certainly more profitable to farm COMP than to sell Dai for a small premium. This could break the peg sharply. Even the creation of new supply (generated through Maker) might go to COMP farming rather than selling. All of the debt ceilings might instantly be maxed out (except maybe USDC-B). Does the community generally agree with the above analysis? I\u2019d really like to get some other perspectives. My first instinct is that the typical response to such an event would be the threat of Emergency Shutdown. Only if Dai holders are at risk of taking an instant loss (if they are purchasing Dai significantly above $1) might they think twice about undertaking such an activity. But I think we should explore other options such as special risk parameters for ETH or USDC (lower LR, higher DC), or maybe even reach out to and participate in the Compound governance process. It would be ideal if we could have more than the 4 remaining days to plan for what\u2019s about to come. Thank you to Will Price for walking me through these scenarios. ",

Especially since my capital remains liquid (unless utilization is at 100%\u2026) and I can move to better opportunities if they open up . Btw. there is a new DAI interest model in the works - the formal proposal should come tomorrow. Here is the discussion: https://compound.comradery.io/post/1783 All the proposed changes should help, especially setting the DAI APY at 80% (instead of 90%) to 4%. Also, I expect a lot of farmers to just supply and borrow ETH - to remove the liquidation risk. The interest spread between borrowing/supplying is between 2-4%, so saving a percentage point on interest payment by borrowing DAI is probably not worth the additional risk. Even more importantly, I can borrow close to 75% by staying in ETH, whereas with DAI I\u2019d probably stay well below 60% Edit: Well not \u201ca lot of farmers\u201d since you can\u2019t borrow the asset you\u2019re supplying through the UI\u2026 but probably the bigger farmers.

The safe way to leverage yield farming is never with DAI, because DAI can spike up and your leverage position at compound could get liquidated, currently their oracle has a 1.05 DAI/USD top limit. This could be changed and leverage positions would get liquidated. The correct way in my opinion, is possibly take ETH/WBTC/BAT mint DAI --> sell for USDC which is always $1, lever up at compound to earn COMP. This might be a giant gift for MKR token holders because they will need to raise interest rates to match this new demand for minting DAI. Defisaver and Instadapp who are helping with this leveraged positions, need to help unwind the whole trade if ETH/WBTC/BAT are falling. So again if ETH/WBTC/BAT fall in price\u2026, there is a DAI demand problem with closing out vaults, so USDC vaults debt ceiling might need to be raised to handle DAI spike in price when volatile crypto falls\u2026 Lots of variables at play, would love to hear more analysis from others, but overall I think this might be a positive event for Maker.

                    "content": "I was looking at what the real answer is here about this compound farming but have not taken on the risk of the new compound governance change here to DAI and maker. @cyrus Your analysis looks correct. The risk is of taking on the trade in/out over the time frame expected and prices of the assets.  USDC has less of a pricing risk but ETH could be used to Mint DAI and swapped for USDC.  There is a time/pricing on DAI risk here.  How much of a premium that can be paid see numbers below.   The other issue becomes if supply return rates rise enough to pull in more compound supply as the supply side of the equation that puts a rate and comp drag on the rest.  I don\u2019t think it is big enough to offset the leverage available here and the rate of return given comp drip and price in USD.  So once this starts to move it will max out available supply depending on the DAI/USDC pricing risk over the time of availability. It is entirely unclear how the farming mechanics will play out  in detail but given the returns available below based on the new comp metric about to go into effect is significant and the analysis above pretty correct. Here is what I have as a basic financial analysis on this. $1B compound supply+borrow assets under deposit (doesn\u2019t matter exactly HOW it got there - it IS there).  The yield it is currently seeking is .5COMP/block or 2880 COMP/day.   I think they lowered this slightly to .44COMP/block.  We should check and post numbers for the calculations here. Release 2880COMP/day valued at 240USD and compound is offering approx .7M USD/day for $1B of assets under depost (all that is changing is the value of comp and the amount of deposits seeking these 2880 COMP) that is all. $1B earning .0007 or .07%/day available at current comp prices and current drip rate (doesn\u2019t matter the model) works out to 29%/yr - on the entire $1B however it is portioned out (some deposits will earn more some less) This is going to screw with whatever interest rate model you are dropping on top of it and changing the nature of how the comp will be rewarded just shifts the 29% yield around in those $1B in assets. Given the size of this yield currently it is causing unusual behavior driving defi liquidity availability to extremes.  Fortunately with BAT this has not seemed to cause a price problem.  Given the recent increase in reserve requirements (50% on BAT/ZRX/etc) and interest rate models will drive assets into the lower yield spread instruments (USDC and DAI as well as possibly USDT to some extent) and if leverage can be applied to lever up this return it will. I completely agree that something needs to be done, but it is unclear what can be done.   Add more DC and all that will happen is that it will be soaked up - entirely. The problem here won\u2019t be the DC, but the PEG mechanics will be completely broken. I do NOT think we can up the DC enough to satisfy this and the question becomes how do we do this safely with respect to assets.   I know this is counter intuitive and may cause even more pressure on DAI/USDC PEG price in the short term but I would be prepared to soak up some of this problem with a somewhat higher SF (now rather than later) and allow the system to expand into this with a high DAI/USDC PEG rate against not just an across the board SF increase when the DC needs to be expanded but also a preemptive SF rate increase to build some surplus reserve incase things go whacky.  Ideas to expand borrowing into B,C asset classes to expand the DCs with higher rates and higher LR as well as higher Liquidation Fees in particular may help. Remember we still have a somewhat liquidity constrained liquidation system and we don\u2019t want to stretch this.   Right now the only deposit system that DOESN\u2019T have an auction system is the USDC ones   This needs to be fixed ASAP before Maker gets trapped in some wierd USDC/DAI price swing and can not auction the USDC position.  We need USDC people to manage their LR\u2019s against liquidations like normal.   Whether to lower the LR there I\u2019d say no.   Honestly I would want to increase the LR on a new facility so that we can sop up some of the USDC looking to find DAI and reduce leverage available.   People using ETH to borrow DAI should be ok.   Be prepared to expand the DC\u2019s into this as demand is driven into it and make bloody sure to increase the SF (now) rather than later.   We already know the PEG price mechanics are going to be screwed due to this and there will be nothing we can do about that.   Literally may not be able to expand borrowing into this to provide enough liquidity and anyone trying to take the DAI USDC short here could get really hurt in multiple ways until compound fixes the problem. I honestly would consider governance minting \u2018out of thin air\u2019 DAI to exchange for USDC or other assets during this price rise to try to manage the increase and PEG somewhat.   We literally are going to have to, by force and temporairly reduce the assets backing DAI, to make it LESS attractive to own it.  Playing the liquidity game directly within the protocol and hazarding (to some extent) our DAI holders I think is the only way to have any hope of managing this situation so that the DAI USDC price doesn\u2019t get totally out of whack with no way to bring it back. I do have an idea for how compound can mitigate this issue that i have mentioned in discord #governance channel, but need to formally write up, but each time I have brought up pieces of this idea it has been rejected. Conceptually the problem here as illustrated above is the high $$ comp value.   The solution is basically to take the remaining 4.4M being portioned out and doing the following: D1_D  Democratically distribute N comp to all wallets that so that D1=wallets*Ncomp a)  Have at least one deposit tx to compound AND b)  Still have at least $100 worth of cTOKENs OR $100 worth of debt currently. c)  Drip it out at a rate determined by age of (a) the older the wallet the faster the drip of N to that wallet.  or do it all as an air-drop based on a chain snapshot at some time T (preferred) D2_I  Use the total interest earned and paid on each wallet (i.e. real compound useage) prior to this debacle to calculate a air-dropped distribution to all the wallets.  We voted at compound some time ago on what assets to add to the protocol based on interest/paid earned so I know this is doable.  It is a fixed distribution based on the snapshot time T D3_C  Use the rest of the Comp to distribute based on a $$ value model of comp with a cap of D3_C/4years so that the distribution model does not distribute more than C% $$ value of comp for $$ Total value of assets so that the interest earned on the $$ value of the comp is no more than 1%/yr in USD value. Additionally taking some restrictions off the holders of the first 5.5M comp distributed so they can sell would help but only after D1, D2 are distributed.  (give your users with comp first shot at these markets as a reward for being there before everyone else) D1+D2+D3=4.4M and D1+D2 should be >= D3 to deal with comp liquidity and price problem. The point with the above is that there simply is not enough COMP distributed yet to drop the price to realistic levels.  One could allow the insiders to sell it all but why not simply air-drop COMP based on PRIOR use and performance to reward your users and help depress the price of COMP with supply.   D3_C is the critical component to eliminate this COMP farming though.   If one sets the yearly return on $$ value COMPed to be a small % in $$ value relative to the Total $$ supplied - adding assets will NOT increase the value relative to assets until the price of COMP drops so that the D3_C supply cap for the 4 year distribution works out.  Basically this becomes \u2018solved\u2019 when the price in USD of COMP drops so that the max D3_C drop of .44COMP/block has a value < 1% yrly return on the supplied $$ value of assets. Note 1% is arbitrary but needs to be reasonably low.  IN this low rate environment 1% is literally double the current returns on most assets.   It was picked to literally be as low as reasonably possible but still drip out some in D3 until comp prices normalize much lower.    The other key component is to get liquidity out there based on some snapshot for the D1, D2 air drops of COMP.   I honestly don\u2019t know why the team there did not consider doing this so the markets instantly get a good chunk of liquidity so price wouldn\u2019t get out of hand.    The final piece is not allowing COMP not matter what the price to be driped out at a rate higher than 1% $$ return on total assets supplied seeking this return.   I consider even 1% to still be somewhat high but tolerable as compared to the current 29% return rate on $1B of assets supplied. ",

                    "content": "I do not think it is a good idea to sell MKR to buy DAI.   In effect all the system needs to be able to do is just Mint DAI - MIP14 the DAI out to another account to buy assets (how and who does this is a real question but it will be needed eventually).   MKR by definition is already pledged to make up the difference.   Running a negative surplus literally means the assets backing DAI are NOT 1:1 but if we buy say stable coin assets it will.   Just the surplus will read negative -$XM DAI while another account with have surplus +$YM stablecoins (USDC and the like).    This literally IS a DAI direct injection mechanism controlled by MKR through MKR governance backed in the end by MKR and probably the only solution to manage this. As I look at it unless the stablecoin values really change this would still create roughly 1:1 DAI backing but still create DAI to inject via the asset buying mechanism.   I would limit buying only to stablecoins though as we don\u2019t want to drive asset prices but simply DIRECT INJECT DAI liquidity based on minting DAI running a negative DAI surplus against a + stable coin account.  Not as a decentralized model or DAI facility for everyone to use but directed by governance the MKR holders that are going to back this with their MKR in the end. The reasoning here is that governance won\u2019t have to pay a stability fee or worry about liquidations doing this.   The issue is that governance may not be fast enough to do this.  What we really need is a elected team to do the fast paced management, guided by governance and risk teams on this but I don\u2019t see it happening fast enough.    Literally I don\u2019t think Maker will be able to respond fast enough nor has the tools to act properly to try to rebalance the DAI market.    The problem will be measuring what is needed and then trying to manage providing it.   We literally are going to have to leave things alone until we see how bad the DAI PEG gets and then try to figure out based on how much DAI liquidity was soaked up by compound to see what the first pass looks like. My suggestion is that we raise the SF to 1% now rather than later.  Deal with the inevitable PEG hit until compound gets their shit together with a real tangible plan that stops this.   Right now nothing I see in prop 10 (enacted) and prop 11 (soon to be) is going to change anything except drop this problem right into USDC and DAI laps.   Will USDC with stable prices soak this up or will it drive against DAI. I am with @cyrus it is probably going to drive against DAI until the PEG compensates, I think from a risk perspective we have to raise SF since lowering it later won\u2019t do dink (DCs will be maxed out already) and we will quickly find ourselves back at my mint DAI run a negative DAI surplus and buy stablecoin solution to direct inject DAI liquidity to manage this.    My problem is what if this cranks DAI up to $.5-1B.   But if we throw a SF on this of at least 1-2% we can capture the added liquidity SF fees as a kind of risk compensator.   In the end once this comes under control governance can use the stablecoins to unwind the DAI short stablecoin or stablecoin long positions and bring the surplus back to positive and then decide what to do with the extra DAI generated. I have not had much time to look at the exact details on this but I am pretty sure the DAI PEG is probably going to see north of 1.03 for some sustained time if the markets fall we are going to have a hell of a problem with DAI liquidity for ETH or other collateral auctions.   I think we need to warn borrowers to start paying back, which again is a reason to raise the SF.   Try to reign in the system now and put a risk premium on all of this now before it gets out of control until compound reigns this in. ",

I was looking at .15-.2%/day return on assets here but this is going to change with prop 11.  Until I see this in my own account I won\u2019t have a good handle.

I will still get the comp but no longer the 13% additinal supply return on the BAT, ZRX.   The comp return is sufficient to drive rates to 8-10% supply/return diff and still give a solid 10-20% return on top of this whatever asset is applied. No matter how I turn this it is the $$ value of the comp being distributed against this $1B in assets seeking this 290M US equivalance of comp looking to slowly drip out over the past year.

All leverage does is make more tx costs and for same capital ups the return.  I actually am not using much leverage.  Other players are.   Biggest reason is that leverage here is strictly controls by Liquidation Ratios or Collateralization Ratios on assets where one can borrow. It also takes two wallets and double the tx\u2019s to basically do something like Deposit DAI, borrow ETH,  sell ETH for DAI and repeat this or some variation of it with collateral to \u2018lever\u2019 up. Literally the COMP return on capital if the return model was strictly based on a capital allocated scheme would be straight across all assets.   Because they don\u2019t take the total comp dripped and split is based on capital allocation vs. splitting this on asset classes they will skew again the return into the asset classes.  @cyrus is correct in that the lowest rate spread assets will be the ones that will be racheted up.   So BAT should drop and USDC, DAI will probably crank up.    But there is no diff in someone levering $10K to 30K than someone levering $10M to 30M except in the details of how the COMP value is spread across the asset classes (which is varying).   The total COMP from drip still remains the same and hence the problem remains the same depending on total COMP distributed and $$ COMP value. I agree the problem is complex and it also is a moving target right now.   What is NOT complex is the math on the available return here.  Number of COMP * COMP dollar value / Total $$ in the system (borrowed/supplied) is the pure driving force here.   The portioning out is only relevant from the asset classes affected and compound is not applying an across the board same approach.   This literally is wreaking havoc in their own system as well but with 50% reserve fees at least they are picking up some risk value.    This is a real problem Maker is going to be forced to reckon with and it is a fast changing dynamic given compound own governance process that is simply taking the same $$ amount rather than changing the allocation amount so the drip no more than a 1% $$ yield on the total assets. Until this changes the problem continues and I as a market participant will take advantage like the rest. ",

                    "content": "[x-posted from rocketchat] As was suggested over the past few days, I think we should make plans to (a) lower the USDC liquidation ratio, and (b) add an ETH-B collateral type with a higher stability fee. However, I think that it\u2019s actually unlikely that the COMP distribution change is going to result in much DAI getting sucked up, for the following reasons:   post-patch, COMP yield will be independent of the interest rate earned/paid, and instead becomes proportional to $totalBorrowedInX / ($totalSuppliedInX * $totalBorrowedInAll) for suppliers on market X and proportional to 1 / $totalBorrowedInAll for borrowers on market X. At current COMP yields, and in light of the popular supply/borrow recycling trick, this is purely a coordination/schelling point game where the goal is for everyone to supply/borrow as much as possible to the same market, and due to the high COMP yield the interest earned/paid on the borrow itself is less relevant.   given (1), the best potential schelling point in the short term is one which can bring in the most supply, i.e. the asset that is the most liquid to borrow. I believe this means that the likeliest candidates will be ETH, USDC, or USDT (in decreasing order of likelihood). I believe ppunktw also already made the point on the forum post about ETH, that it will make more sense for farmers to directly supply ETH into compound (and then do the recycling dance to reborrow it, etc.), rather than mint DAI against ETH to supply into compound which reduces their yield by their collateral ratio and introduces liquidation risk. Buying DAI off of the market to supply to compound is more capital efficient, however quickly runs into liquidity issues which IMO puts a cap on the size of that market and makes it an unlikely schelling point (as opposed to ETH, USDC, or USDT where the amount that can be sucked in is virtually unlimited).   as we have seen with BAT, both the theoretical and practical equilibrium is for farmers to crowd into the same asset, due to the COMP yield being proportional to the market\u2019s share of borrows. Therefore, unless DAI turns out to be the schelling point, it is likely to be little affected.   in the long term, if COMP yields decay (due to growing assets in Compound or the price of COMP coming down or both), then margins for farmers become squeezed, and only then do the compound interest rates start to become significant in the calculation again. It\u2019s true that in that case the shape of the DAI interest rate curve might make it an attractive schelling point, however I think lack of liquidity will stop it from catching up with the more liquid assets which could have hundreds of millions of $ in outstanding borrows at that point.   Overall I think it\u2019s very hard to predict what will happen with any of these incentive changes, and I\u2019m not proposing any specific outcome with high certainty. However, I also don\u2019t think DAI becoming the main farming asset with supply getting sucked into compound is the most likely scenario. I think we should prepare measures (a) and (b) for that case anyway, however I don\u2019t see a reason to panic yet. EDIT: an earlier version of this post had an error in the heuristic formula for COMP yields in point (1), which I have attempted to correct. I think the conclusions from it remain the same though.

                    "content": "Agree, from what I have seen on Compound so far, larger whales determine markets that receive most of COMP rewards and its more probable ETH becomes dominant assets that gets recycled and less likely DAI, despite its favourable rate curve. For instance BAT dominates Compound now not just because of steep rate curve (current COMP compensation is based on rate levels) but also because few BAT whales showed up and recycled (borrowed and resupplied) its BAT assets 4x+ (yes actual BAT deposited on Compound is less than 25% of what you see). I think its more probable we see similar behaviour with ETH than DAI because there\u2019s simply more ETH whales than DAI whales. As Lev said I also don\u2019t believe ETH whales are willing to buy DAI (slippage issues) or mint it (liquidation threats). Potentially they could though swap ETH for USDC and mint DAI, but then you have to ask yourself why ETH whales would want stable exposure just because of COMP rewards. I am worried though that lower LR for USDC might be used by USDC whales to mint DAI and supply and recycle at Compound. So maybe lower LR USDC vault is not the best idea? Again, it is hard to forecast anything and I think its more probable DAI won\u2019t dominate unless some weird dynamics (increased refinancing from Maker to Compound) boost DAI markets on Compound and overtake ETH. I would hope thought that ETH whales simply dominate from day one. ",

As most of the BAT were the same BAT going in supply and borrow but the market difference of borrow and supply went to more than $30,000,000 meaning 10times more BAT ended up locking in Compound which also increased the BAT price because of higher demand in the market.

It can also result for Vault owners to move their Vault to Compound which wasn\u2019t relevant till now but after this new vote, it\u2019ll be. Problem: an increase in DAI demand will result in DAI peg making DAI > $1. Solution: Vote to make USDC-A liquidation ratio at 110% which will help users to take arbitrage advantage up to 10x and instant increase in DAI supply. This looks like most reliable to me for the short term DAI stability. ",

Details can be found here:    compound.finance    Compound Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of open financial applications.      It was submitted by Alameda Research (affiliated with FTX exchange that recently listed COMP and MKR derivatives contracts). These folks are frankly pretty adversarial (same team that gamed BAL distribution with fake leveraged tokens), definitely worth watching out for. Their original wish list of Compound changes can be found here: https://compound.comradery.io/post/1784 Edit: Proposal was cancelled already, that was fast lol. 2nd Edit: Proposal was resubmitted as proposal 14.
