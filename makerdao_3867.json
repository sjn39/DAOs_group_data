Continue my loyalty and love for the Maker Community by making myself available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\u2013I will be here, ready, willing, and able. Prioritize the achievements and future success of MakerDAO. Help the Maker Community to expand its network effects.  Delegate Statement For the last 30+ months I have been one of the top 10 MakerDAO Voters. I have probably voted over 150+ times with my MKR tokens. And this passion and focus for Maker Governance has been inspired by All of you, and I mean every  single one of you. Yes, you have inspired me and help me follow this passion and mission to make DAI the ultimate decentralized stablecoin. It\u2019s a passion that we share\u2013the passion of Maker+DAI changing the world. The dream of making DAI the standard of Decentralized Finance. My Ethereum Address with its small portion of MKR might have never carried every Poll and Executive Vote, but thru it all I have always help protect the Hat and I have never let high ETH Gas Prices deter me from voicing my opinion and protecting this protocol. My love for the community and passion for MakerDAO is more important than any ETH gas I have spent. And that commitment and love my Maker Fam, it will never diminish. I want to be your MKR Delegate because I believe in you. I believe in your passion. I believe and share your dreams. I believe in a fully decentralized DAO composed of community members that are loyal, responsible, and innovative. Community members who want the same success that Maker has achieved today and the greatness that it will achieve tomorrow. This is why\u2014when I was asked to join a Working Group to help compose MIP38 DAO Primitives State, MIP39 Core Unit Framework, MIP40 Budget Framework, and MIP41 Facilitator Framework, I did not hesitate. I did not have any Fear. Because this is my passion. This is our home. And protect and build our home is what we do as MKR token holders. Maker Community, I want to represent your Voice. I want to represent your Vision. Yes, I promise to protect MakerDAO from the Fear of innovating, the Fear of pivoting if needed, the Fear of never reaching decentralization, and the fear of governance attacks. I will do this by listening to your believes, your scientific governance theories, and following the path and vision of the Maker Community and its original vision. That same vision that was put together years ago by a community of Finance Nerds who had the hunger and the passion for changing the status quo. I will protect our Maker ways by inspiring my Delegate colleagues to unite and protect the protocol from any outside attackers, and/or attack vectors. We will work together, follow common grounds and stay diligent. At times, you and I might have had different opinions. Some opinions were probably similar, others were misconstrued because communication in writing can be misinterpreted. Other times, some of you were too busy to participate and voice your opinion. And then there were some of you who wanted to participate but felt your MKR holdings were not going to make a difference. Well, I am here to tell you that you will no longer be unnoticed. You will no longer be unheard. You will no longer need to attend every meeting, read every Forum Post, review every MIP application\u2013I will represent you. I will be your voice; I will be your eyes and ears\u2013and you will be the heartbeat of Maker Governance. The pulse of the community will not go unnoticed. It is because we share this common passion that I ask that you delegate your MKR to Flip Flop Flap Delegate. I promised to respect your views and listen to your concerns. I promised to explain why I voted for Polls and Executives and if you disagree with such vote, I will make time to listen to you and hold your hand as we both shape and build this DAO, together as one. Conflicts of Interest  At times I might buy, sell, or hold other Crypto Tokens for short & long-term trading purposes.  I have read and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of liability By delegating to Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC, you acknowledge and agree that Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC, will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.

I fully support their vision and desire to grow the supply of DAI. This will also diversify DAI collateral and provide some comfort to those that worry about the Maker\u2019s exposure to USDC. Governance Poll: Reduce Vault Liquidation Ratios - August 16, 2021 Voted Yessss\u2014The Risk CU posted an analysis on decreasing liquidation ratios and the Community did not object. Using their Risk Models, the ratios were battled tested, and I believe this is the right approach. I do hope that eventually the Maker protocol will be compensated a bit more for all the Risk it takes. Community Greenlight Poll: CNC1-DROP (CapitalNow Cannabis DROP) - August 16, 2021 Voted Yes\u2014this company has underwritten over 85,000 transactions and has 13 years\u2019 experience in this field. You couple that with the fact that that more American voters and state legislatures support the approval of either medicinal, or adult recreational use of cannabis\u2014I believe this is a sector Maker should consider. Governance Poll: NCP01-DROP (Nebula Capital Partners DROP) - August 16, 2021 Voted Yes\u2014if you didn\u2019t get a chance to watch the Collateral Onboarding Call with Nebula and the folks from Tinka I strongly recommend you do! Impressive Teams, and a promising product (Tinka)\u2014this as I like to say, is a no-brainer. Not to mention that NCP has Skin in the Game! Community Greenlight Poll:  CGFF-DROP (Cauris Global Fintech Fund DROP) - August 16, 2021 Voted Yes\u2014another RWA candidate that will have skin in the game as they will invest in a significant amount of the TIN tranche to show confidence in the pool via a \u201cDebt Venture Fund\u201d. They are also on a mission to close the gap on financial inclusion for medium and small businesses. I believe this is where MakerDAO can showcase its goodness and love for humanity. ",

Looking forward to following developments closely and voting on future LendCo\u2019s that follow the same path. The Risk Core Unit presented the community with an analysis for decreasing LR only for second tier vault types by 10%, and decreasing LR for leading vaults. The community, including myself did not have any objections, as most of us believe this is a positive in case of a Market drawdown (particularly ETH) \u2013 Vault owners will appreciate the lower LR. The community opine via a Signal Request that the PSM-USDC-A Fee-In (tin) will be increased from 0.1% to 0.2%.

Voted, \u201cYes.\u201d Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type In what I personally consider an early probationary period for Recognized Delegates, this in my opinion has been our toughest Poll since seeking tenure as a MakerDAO Delegate. Its comprehensible that Delegates and most of the Maker Community lack, or retain a background/experience in Project Finance. Therefore, I believe its my responsibility as a Delegate to put in the time and effort to investigate as much as possible\u2013the \u201cdealings\u201d pertaining to this collateral type, and also rely on the much needed guidance of our RWF CU. After numerous hours of reading, researching, and asking questions\u2013I believe that this project has infinitesimal downside and a much greater upside. While no business wants to lose 3,285,000 DAI\u2013Delegates and the Maker community expect SolarX @Andy.SolarX to provide a Trust Structure that is acceptable to MKR token holders, before this MIP6 Application goes to an Executive Vote.

Excited to see inception of the DAI Foundation kickstart a long everlasting representation of what DAI stands for\u2013bringing a lot of goodness to the world. You couple that with some parameter changes that I believe will help expand the utility of DAI, and necessary funding for SES growth, this was a \u201cYes\u201d vote that needed to be placed on a Friday evening.

It\u2019s not necessarily why I voted yes, but IMO the utility of this token has waned. I can\u2019t remember the last anybody has brought-up BAT in a crypto related conversation. Another factor\u2014most BAT token hodlers can\u2019t afford to open a Vault, as the dust parameters are 10K DAI. Offboard the LRC-A Vault Type Besides the reasons Instated above, IMO the Loopring community is more focus on building their protocol via incentives  that favors the dedicated layer 2 LRC user. Hence, I believe their focus is not on leveraging L1 but more in keeping their protocol as the main focus. Offboard the UNIV2AAVEETH-A The utility of AAVE as a staking/governance token, plus the fact that most DeFi users are now smart enough to recognize and understand that impermanent loss is real \u2014 has taken a bite-out of this Uniswap LP token. Plus you add the fact that even Avalanche partnership is offering incentives for AAVE token holders\u2014the appetite for this LP token is non-existent, IMO. Offboard the ZRX-A Vault Type The OG of DeFi \u2014 sad to see this one get off-boarded, but as Rema of the Risk CU team stated, \u201c We are currently subsidising these vault types because the stability fee is set to 3% and 4% respectively, while our calculated risk premium is at 16.8% and 30%.\u201d  I also admired that Decentraland (MANA) came out and communicated to our community that they wanted to help their token scale via the MANA-A Vault Type. I think some of us would have liked to have seen the same from the ZRX community\u2026 Offboard the UNIV2LINKETH-A Vault Type As we All know the majority of LINK tokens are in the hands of folks that probably do not include MakerDAO in their Christmas list. Although many moons ago I voted to onboard this collateral type, I never felt confident that it would blossom. That feeling was mutual as the community overwhelmingly polled to off-board this Vault Type. RISK-001 MKR Vesting Stream a well deserved compensation for two Risk CU teammates that have done a superb job on-behalf of MakerDAO\u2014thank you!

We also must appreciate the fact that stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto. You couple that with the fact that LidoDAO has been doing tremendous work to improve liquidity and has compelled investors to lock ETH via incentives, I believe this collateral type is beneficial to Maker. Nexo Institutional Vault Onboarding - October 11, 2021 Voted, \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 I believe the Growth CU and Risk team along with the Community did a tremendous job hammering out the parameters and operating conditions for both institutional vaults ( INST ETH-A & INST WBTC-A). Looking forward to onboarding more institutional partners. PaperImperium Supplemental Compensation - October 11, 2021 Voted, \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 I might not agree with PaperImperium all the time  but the has brought a ton of value to the Community and has worked hard to help the DAO. More importantly I believe that it is important that Delegates seek legal advice, as this is an opaque risk-on hazardous role, which currently has no upside. We do it because we are passionate   Add the Aave Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 Shoutout to @EthWarrior and the AAVE Community for introducing the D3M to the Maker Community. \u201cTogether we can face any challenges as deep as the ocean and as high as the sky\u201d \u2013Sonia Gandhi   Here\u2019s to the start of a beautiful relationship that works for both communities and benefits DeFi adoption across  L1 & L2s.

Not that I have any issue with the abstention but I would like to point out that there are two separate things to consider here:   @PaperImperium\u2019s work as a delegate His work as a community member.  The compensation being voted on now is for item 2. It should not matter that he also happens to be a delegate. Unfortunately, I find that this was not sufficiently emphasized, even in the original signal request thread. I think it is important to make this sort of thing more clear and I hope Paper joins in making these lines less blurry. We all benefit from clarity on what compensation is for what work. ",

I think the specific way delegation works means we don\u2019t need delegates to abstain. In a traditional setting you could vote yourself a high salary and nobody could do anything for X years. With delegation voting power can be instantly taken away, and decisions like that can be mostly reverted. It also doesn\u2019t sound very realistic to have delegates not vote on an executive. Does it have a chance to pass in a reasonable timeframe without them?

Also, the new hiring of Corina as Project Manager is a plus, as the team is laser focused on expanding campaigns with current partners. Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 Deco is a platform that allows Maker to set/control the rates for Fixed Yields, and its designed by a former Maker Engineer (some might say a Maker OG) @vamsi \u2013 who IMO is top tier talent and I believe most MKR holders should want and love to see veterans like him continue to contribute. It is aligned with the right incentives, as this core unit is proposed on standard compensation terms and profit share will kick-in if Deco is successful. I am also excited to see Deco used as a test-case within project Sandbox. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 it is vital that we support our Core Units. It is extremely important that our Team members sleep well at night knowing that MKR token holders support their efforts, and understand that their comfort via Job Security will equal productive and positive-sum results. And yes, this CU needs to modify their budget \u2013 but think about the stress that this mishap has put on the entire team. One thing we All must remember is that the blockchain is an open book. The DAI streamed to All the Core Units is available for you and I to check via the Makerburn Accounting Dashboard. And yes, they are \u201cunder budget\u201d. But let\u2019s not forget that the Content Core Unit has not been operating for that long. And when an entrepreneur starts a new business the most comforting resource is having excess capital that ensures versus an unexpected expense, or scaling the business by hiring new team members (Content CU is in the midst of doing such). More importantly\u2013let\u2019s be honest\u2013the DAI is still in their multi-sig and there has never been a sign of them behaving maliciously. On a weekend where PECU delivered and amazing feat of MakerDAO strength and goodness\u2013 by helping an end-user recover their ETH\u2013I support our Core Units, and therefore I Vote YES to the @Content-Production budget. Ratification Poll for Implementation of DSS Charter (MIP59) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 I fully support the DssCharter as it will boost DAI supply and incentivize long-term borrowers. Ratification Poll for Adding Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cYes\u201d, as many CU teams have used the talents of DIN and such CU provided positive feedback on the results of working with DIN. Ratification Poll for Adding MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) - October 11, 2021 Voted \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 IMO MakerLabs would have benefitted from the SES incubator program as their proposal currently lacks a pipeline, clear requirements, and milestones. I urge @ultraschuppi and his team not to give-up and be resilient as the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit and @monkey.irish \u2013 who had to go through 3 iterations to finally get onboarded. \u201cPlay iterated games.

Here is how it would work.  picture2675\u00d71557 214 KB      With an increasing number of categories joining the CurioDAO platform in the near future, CSC could rapidly scale into a multi-billion USD market cap. This diminishes any initial risks or obstacles such as costs to implement and maintain CSC as collateral.

Voted, \u201cYes\u201d on the following items:   The rapid growth of WBTC has been impressive and we believe it will continue to scale to DeFi via most of the active cross-chains. With over 75% of the BTC on Ethereum currently being composed of WBTC, we believe a type-B collateral type of WBTC will attract more minting of DAI.   We support the increase of 150 basis points to WBTC-A, as readings of the usability of this Collateral Type have increased in recent months. Ongoing popularity of BTC within DeFi will remain strong as inflation expectations remain sky-high.   As stated in our previous comments, we are in support of off-boarding the aforementioned collateral types.   Previously Voted, \u201cNo\u201d on the following item:  We are supporters of the American Heartland and the folks who are the unsung heroes of the economy, Farmers. However, the covenant changes were in our believe requested without a provided written opinion from Sherman & Sterling on the current legal structure. Therefore, we believe we have acted in the best interest of MakerDAO when rejecting the covenant changes. In the grand scheme of things, indeed the requested amount for an increase in acquisition price from $1.5 million to $2.85 million is small, but not as important as the principle of keeping MakerDAO safe.

Located southeast of Costa Rica, this resort has good reviews, beautiful beaches, and pre-covid could have been developed as secret getaway location. It is also interesting to see that their parent company Oceans Group International, Inc. S.A. is Green Globe Certified and they were an Energy Globe Award winner in 2020. We also came across an interesting proposal to build an airport in Bocas del Toro. Again, this MIP6 has peaked our curiosity, therefore we believe its best to take a stand versus Abstaining.

It is evident that during a hard selloff it will be more difficult for small Vault owners to replenish their positions\u2013and unfortunately it is not cost effective. Even then, we also opted via the 3rd Signal Request to increase the Dust Parameter for ETH-C as well\u2013but the community decided to stay neutral\u2013which provides folks the option to move from A to C.

This interest-bearing collateral currently lacks liquidity, as the pricing mechanisms are opaque. As an example we witness the token traded in a range of 1.1999 to 1.1599 within an hour on Coingecko. We also searched the realms of Osmosis (Cosmos) and Raydium (Solana) \u2013 but were unsuccessful in locating any liquidity.  Community Greenlight Poll - G-UNIv3-DAIUSDP (Gelato UniswapV3 DAI-USDP LP Token) - December 06, 2021 Voted, \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 as an indication of interest for a collateral type that might not be ideally profitable and might lack usability. This MIP6 application was well thought out and informative, prior to the recent volume and liquidity migration to the 0.01% fee pools. However the recent proposal to the Aave community to Add G-UNI to Aave V2 AMM Market is an interesting development. This can perhaps get the folks over at Paxos to look into developing more liquidity flows.  Executive Proposals  Parameter Changes, Delegate Compensation, Vault Onboarding - December 3, 2021 Voted, \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 with the highly anticipated MOMC parameter changes, we believe the recent \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by investors going into the end of the year will be temporary. We also believe the cautionary approach to the recent indication that the Fed will taper asset purchases, and interest rates possible trend higher in 2022, has lead to the acceleration for the selloff of assets that have relatively high valuations. However, we believe investor risk appetite will return in Q1 2022 and will lead to a more robust market environment. The GUNIDAIUSDC2-A vault pivot is a smart move and should lead to higher trading volume. Switching gears, the most disappointing part of this Executive is the unfortunate cutoff of compensation for @MakerMan \u2013 a dedicated community member who we truly believe deserves his due portion of compensation. After all, it is the Holidays\u2013lets be good to each other! Although it was as unfortunate turn of events\u2013we can\u2019t forget the hard work and dedication that GovAlpha-Core-Unit has put into structuring this preliminary compensation structure that we believe  will attract more Delegates.  While not perfect, it has once again proven that together as a decentralized community, we can make things happen! ",

Coming off its successful 2021 run, the D3M is now being proposed as an expansion tool for Compound.finance, a platform that currently has DAI as their #1 most active stablecoin ahead of USDC. Compound can be defined as a conservative platform with over 19,000++ suppliers of DAI, that currently earn COMP governance tokens at a rate of 90 basis points per annum. We believe the R/R ratio is optimal, as the D3M can help build and further strengthen the relationship with the Compound community.  Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance - January 10, 2022 Voted Yes \u2013 we are supporting the Signal Request for the Maple DAI pool via the D3M with the understanding that key players in both the RWF CU & Growth CU teams have already been actively in-talks with the Maple team and will create a Sandbox design that will incorporate a trial-run at small scale, with the final goal to implement a legal structure for the benefit of MakerDAO. We also request feedback with regards to Maker earning MPL farming rewards, and request further details of the technical challenges.  We believe accumulating MPL within the Maker Treasury will be beneficial to the Maple community, and allow this DAO to participate and help govern the future of Maple Finance.  Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold - January 10, 2022 Voted Yes \u2013 as Flip Flop Flap Delegate along with the Community have been proponents of raising the ESM threshold to 100,000 MKR since April, 2021. Long overdue as the community had favorably signaled to increase it to 100K back then.  Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults - January 10, 2022 Voted Yes \u2013 with the continue success of Eth Gas Guzzlers like OpenSea (  $2.1B in sales in the first 10 days of 2022) Uniswap, and as of today, LooksRare\u2013we believe liquidating LP tokens will continue to be an expensive endeavor. Raising the Dust Parameters helps protect MakerDAO from risk of vaults being too small to liquidate at a profit. With that in mind, if this Poll garners enough votes via an Executive Vote, we ask the responsible actors to communicate to the public that the Debt Floor has been raised.  Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow - January 10, 2022 Voted Yes \u2013 with the positive response by the community to help this individual recover her, or his DAI, it leads us to believe that the Maker Community wants to do the right thing and send a signal to the DeFi ecosystem that the Maker community is composed of long-term players, playing in a long-term game. We believe this act-of-kindness will one day be paid back to the community in spades. We also believe this is an honest-human-mistake that can be made by anybody and this individual has warranted the full-support of some key players within the MakerDAO community. We hope to see the day that All individuals are able to recover their lost funds via an automated process that will be recorded like this one, on-chain. ",

The first covers the Recovery of DAI from Optimism, a well discussed Signal Request that was widely debated by the Maker Community. An overwhelming majority of community members want to see the DAO implement a recovery fo DAI policy. We agree and felt that this is good opportunity to help a DAI user recover funds that seem to have been mistakenly burned on Optimism. For more details please visit this post by one of the PECU team members. The second topic at hand focuses around raising the Debt Floor parameters for Uni LP tokens. Such tokens require higher gas costs to liquidate which leads to a lesser buffer for liquidations. We fully support the increase of the Dust/Debt floor. And last but not least, the continuation of the Delegate compensation trial is fully supported as we have witness and increase dialogue and participation within delegates, as we All debate and discuss respectively all of the pending issues at hand. We believe we have a good group of folks that have strong opinions and willingness to push this DAO forward. ",

We also support with this Yes vote the following D3M parameters from the communities sentiment of a 30% target of the real DAI supply on AAVE. DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI (Aave D3M) Changes  Decrease the DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Target Borrow Rate from 3.9% to 3.75%. Increase the DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Target Available Debt from 15 million DAI to 50 million DAI. Increase the DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Maximum Debt Ceiling from 100 million DAI to 220 million DAI.  We also support the Debt Ceiling decreases for YFI, UNI, LINK, UNIV2UNIETH, and GUSD (all Type A) as liquidity for All has decreased. We also support the Debt Ceiling  increase for GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A as the UNI v3 is eating v2\u2019s lunch because of the increase popularity of the 0.01% fee.  Decrease the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio - January 17, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 as we fully support the request from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit to the following community to lower the Collateralization ratio for GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A from 105% to 102%. Eleven (11) POLLS - ENDING JAN 24 2022 16:00 UTC  Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 Please see the following Forum Post: Delegate Pre-Vote Notice  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) (MIP40c3-SP45) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 Its time to do the right thing and settle-up this tab. Thank you to the Maker Foundation for covering gas cost through the transition period\u2013and let\u2019s now move forward as we support our Oracles Core Unit team on their mission to achieving greatness.  Ratification Poll for Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to an impressive team of dedicated team members who we can best describe as the eyes and ears of some of MakerDAO\u2019s important components. A team that\u2019s willing to work around the clock and stay focus while most of us sleep is worthy of catching your attention and recognizing. Fully confident this team will research and innovate components of this DAO. We are thankful to have a team as talented as the incoming TOCU.  Ratification Poll for the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to a team composed of Talented community contributors AES and former RWA facilitator Seb who has gracefully moved from his former role to doing something we believe he\u2019s feeling good about. We are hopeful this CU will onboard more talented individuals to complete their Core Unit and AES will showcase his talents.  Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to a proposal created by fellow Delegate GFX and an All-star team of individuals from the GovAlpha, CES, and GovComms team. Much needed.  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES as StarkNet kicks off phase II which includes the highly anticipated Maker Wormhole and fast withdrawals for the most anticipated L2 scaling solutions on the planet. This budget is split 50/50 between Maker and StarkWare as it includes auditing cost and a bug bounty.  Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to a much needed MIP that will established the bug bounty program for critical infrastructure of MakerDAO via the Immunefi Security Core Unit team. We are confident the rewards will attract the best whitehat hackers on the planet.  Ratification Poll for Maker Keeper Network (MIP63) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to MIP-63 as we support improving the health of the Maker Keeper ecosystem and as we see an increase of popularity for the usage for the D3M module, along with the traditional much needed support of Keepers poking oracles and liquidating vaults.  Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES to a super intelligent human who has the right stuff to lead the RWF CU to greener pastures. Excited to have Will Remor onboarded as we All look forward to working with him.  Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit Budget - DUX-001 (MIP40c3-SP52) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES who in our eyes is a great example of how onboarding via SES incubation can lead to tremendous success and delivery of results to MakerDAO. DUX continues to be a role model for why we fully-believe incubation is the best path to Core Unit prosperity. Very talented team that enjoys getting involved with the Maker community.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) (MIP40c3-SP55) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES as our choice to approved this budget was never in doubt. A talented team led by Rojo that has answered many of our tough questions with regards to KPIs, and other measuring tools in managing his team. For more details please check out the questions and responses posted on this thread. EDIT: Yikes! Embarrassingly I was half-asleep last night past midnight when I posted this final commentary. Apologies on my end \u2013 meant to review my vote for SES not CES  \u2013 but my brain shut down and thought of the wrong CU. Lesson learned. Either way we are behind SES as they provided their year in review (very successful) and the 2022 Roadmap. Their vision is composed of providing a successful  onboarding experience for future Core Units, retention rate, and continuous improvement of identifying scaling bottlenecks, data modeling, and self-accountability/modeling.

DEX liquidity is minimal, most of the liquidity exist in CEXs\u2013we urge @joshfraser @coleman to look to expand DEX liquidity\u2013otherwise this MIP6 application will not make it too far\u2013Core Unit teams will reject it. It is expensive for Maker to onboard ilks and as well for both Oracle and Keepers to manage. We believe Origin is an attractive \u201ctakeover\u201d candidate (speculation & Not Financial Advice) for anybody looking to enter this ecosystem. Origin treasury rivals MakerDAO (at times surpasses it) at $280M  We believe this collateral type garners a high-stability fee in order to recoup cost associated with maintenance and for the urn to be profitable However, this is a \u201cgreenlight\u201d poll and the assessments from Maker Core Units could be unfavorable.   Community Greenlight Poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar) - January 10, 2022 Voted NO to Greenlighting as we continue to see a decent slippage, included in Curve which provides the best avenue for liquidity. We couple that with the exposure to USDT and we believe a PSM for OUSD is not favorable. However, we do encourage the Origin team to open dialogue with the Growth Core Unit about how a OUSD PSM can help scale DAI, and what parameters the Origin Community is willing to accept.  Community Greenlight Poll - TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD) - January 10, 2022 Voted NO to Greenlighting this MIP6 as the Maker Community was rattled by an Actor believed to be connected to TruFi borrowed up to 40,000 MKR from Aave. Such actions can be interpreted as a Governance Attack and we believe that if the accusations are indeed valid, a reasoning behind such move should be posted. Although\u2013some might say that it is fair-game. Note that some community members would have considered a PSM for TUSD, therefore we encourage the TruFi team to communicate their intentions more openly to the Maker community.  Community Greenlight Poll - USDap (BondAppetit) - January 10, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 there is uncertainty when it comes to swapping USDap to DAI (liquidity is hard to find) and we recently came across the former CTO of BondAppetit who has now moved on to build DeFiHelper. So, we wonder where this team stands and how do they will fix their issues with regards to an unstable stablecoin:  image1660\u00d7722 63.3 KB   Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) - January 10, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 please see Delegate Pre-Vote Notice ",

As the MIP6 applicant GFX knows, purchasing US Treasury Securities requires more than just using TreasuryDirect\u2013it will require MakerDAO\u2019s investment considerations (risk & liquidity needs), methods of evaluating risk, experience in understanding the Yield Curve, analysis for extending duration, and previous life-exposure to handling rate shocks. And although this MIP6 applications only pertains to US Treasury Securities, we would prefer to support an Arranger who also has experience with other types of sovereign government bonds. After all, Maker is a global DAO. From the recent methodologies for RWAs, we believe that if this application was review by the incoming RWF teams it would not meet the historical management background and methodology necessary to recommend this MIP6 to be onboarded.

And how do we do that? We continue to compensate Delegate Platforms that are dedicated to go beyond their call-of-duty, and who want to unite this DAO via an aligned vision. We are at a pivotal time where the community needs direction, needs a united vision, alignment, and we believe Delegates can play a role in supporting both the visions and goals of the Core Units, and MKR token owners.  Offloading TUSD-A - February 7, 2022 Rank Choice Voting First Choice: Offload to a new TUSD-PSM with 0 Debt Ceiling. Prefer to explore this option further, as the community was not provided with a risky analysis of Activating Liquidations, and the risks associated with such. We ask that the community explore the risk of Liquidating (Front Running Bots/MEV/slippage)  versus offloading in an orderly fashion via a new TUSD-PSM with 0 DC. As an example, can a major MM desk offload TUSD exclusively and orderly, how much will a \u201cMM desk\u201d charge, versus the possibility of incurring loses via liquidations. Second Choice: Activate Liquidations If an analysis shows that activating liquidations works best, we will be supportive of this method.  Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper - February 7, 2022 Voted YES although this Poll can be misinterpreted\u2013its pretty much a Greenlight Poll, and this solution is incomplete because it doesn\u2019t do much for the proponents who want MKR burns. There are no winners here(except the objective to avoid 0 bids). We also believe the Burner should stay turned-off until we have a long-term solution in place. The 3F Delegate Motto is, \u201cplaying long-term games, with long-term people.\u201d Please note that we opposed this Signal Request. BUT, we have noticed how the community sentiment is split on this subject and others pertaining to the growth of the Surplus Buffer. Therefore, we want to provide support for those that want to explore the Rate Limiter, and for that reason we have voted Yes. However we will not support going back to the same Surplus Buffer configuration. Let\u2019s find a common ground for the long-term benefit of MakerDAO. ",

Both have displayed the true meaning of team work and putting this DAO first.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RISK-001 (MIP40c3-SP56) - February 14, 2022 Voted YES as this new proposal adds a very popular component, Makerburn to its roster. Add to it an expected increase of an additional 3 contributors to the team, this 26% increase in budget is warranted. During the RFC period we asked some tough questions with regards to this budget increase and how to monitor the Team\u2019s performance and we believe actions have been taken to report more efficiently to the community. We also had the pleasure of meeting most of the Risk Core Unit in Lisbon last October and are very aware of the talent they possess.  It\u2019s always good to be on the ground and meet the folks who represent and protect this DAO.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Collateral Engineering Services, CES-001 (MIP40c3-SP57) - February 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 with the expectations of an increase for RWA onboarding activity it is necessary to support CES, as well as their push to help onboard more on-chain collateral types. We also like their approach to monitoring the team progress and we learned a thing, or two about some unique tools that CES uses for team productivity.

We have provided our reasoning and have requested community comments here: [EXECUTIVE VOTE NOTICE] 3F Delegate Cannot Support an INCREASE of the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling Notifying @GovAlpha-Core-Unit that a dissenting vote of an Executive is a Vote. Delegates cannot be expected to Vote YES to every Executive without exercising a reasonable justifiable and appropriate persistent effort to oppose.  EDIT 27/02/2022:In The Spirit of Keeping The Maker Governance Safe, We Have Chosen To Protect The HAT ** This Executive has no substance, it does not improve the protocol and yes, some will argue that it bares no risk. This is good opportunity to explore Delegate best practices, as well as making sure GovAlpha is constructing Executives that are beneficial to the protocol. @psychonaut has ask what is the pretext of 3F Delegate not supporting this Executive? First we don\u2019t want people to think that Delegates are automatically hitting the YES Button on every Executive. We believe that Delegates need to be diligent and objective when representing MKR token owners. We, Delegates are being compensated to perform these task on behalf of MKR token owners. Automatically hitting the YES button without thinking things through is a worrisome practice, IMO. Second, this Signal Request was introduced by a 3rd party that is in the business of creating proposals and establishing a track record of governance. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Governance mining, or as I like to call it \u201cGovernance-as-a-Service\u201d, is a valuable service in Decentralized Governance. But as you know, MKR token owners and Delegates have a duty to protect MakerDAO and thoroughly choose what\u2019s best for the DAO regardless of who or what is proposed. That should always be priority number one. I believe we can agree on that. Third, MKR token owners and Delegates should support our Core Units when partners are not delivering on their promises.If a partner is not supporting our Core Unit vision \u2014 then we Delegates and MKR token owners should support our core units when partners actions are not beneficial to MakerDAO. We are disappointed that some Delegates Left the HAT Vulnerable over an Executive with no Purpose.  image1920\u00d7748 68 KB  ",

First up: PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - February 28, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 as the MOMC recommends a drop of 65 basis points in the AAVE D3M rate from 3.5% to 2.85% \u2013 but an increase of 80M in DC (yay!). As RWAs slowly but surely will look to add credit risk to the protocol(and hopefully some fees), we believe it\u2019s imperative to use the D3M as a substitute to create Revenue streams for the protocol. Thank the lord for the D3M, eh? MOMC reckons this move along with an increase of the DC for WSTETH-A will lead to approximately 3M in annualized revenue. That sounds lovely.  Adding Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions - February 28, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 although we are currently not proponents of Burning (please scale the Surplus Buffer) and performing FLAPs is 186M DAI away\u2013we support the Initiative taken by Derek of PECU and the advice from Primoz of Risk that a lid parameter of 150,000 DAI will help with settling a maximum of 5 surplus auctions every 30 minutes or 7.2m DAI per day. This implementation will help protect Maker against low bids. Hence, we support this Initiative\u2013but prefer to start hearing more from Mandated Actors and the community about scaling the Surplus Buffer.

Reinstate Surplus Buffer Lerp - March 7, 2022 As we start this journey into what some are labeling as a \u201cLong-term Bear Market\u201d, we are proponents of using the DAO\u2019s resources to focus on scaling via D3Ms, ZK-Rollups, sidechains, Maker Wormhole, and the emergence of CanonicalDAI as the premier stablecoin of Decentralized Finance. It is in these moments of time that we believe the mindset of MakerDAO should be on building, innovating, and staying focus on a wider profitable path. At a protocol burn-rate of $42M per year, our main focus should be on scaling the Surplus Buffer. Since 2018 we have over-occupied ourselves watching the Price movements of MKR. We can attest that nor-burning or burning have ever had an impact on the price of MKR. Markets are irrational and burning MKR has never led to positive price action. In fact, at times we were dumbfounded that MKR burning always went unnoticed. But as time elapsed we realized that MKR price action does not get impacted if the MakerDAO Float is 900,000 tokens or, 1,080,000 tokens. It Never matter. Unfortunately the Market does Not care lerp, or no lerp\u2013MKR price action will remain the same. For more details of what we have personally witness, check out this op-ed Against The Burn. In 2020 we witness the Flop Auctions that had the community\u2019s stomach churning. It was a moment in time that we do not to want to relive. At this stage in history, Maker needs to continue to stay resilient, independent, vigorous, and innovative. It is because of the passion to see it succeed that we ask the community to delay the topic of burning of MKR. Believe us, we fell in Love with MKR because of the Burn. But at this moment, we are more passionate about scaling the Surplus Buffer. We move to Vote NO in support for The Need To Scale MakerDAO, Beyond The Lerp. ",

Meetups are an essential part of introducing people to this beautiful ecosystem, and if takes thousands of DAI to fund and find the next big brains of the Maker community we will most certainly support a pilot that has an unlimited amount of upside. When thinking in bets, this is the type of bet that needs to be made.  Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount (MIP4c3-SP1) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES to this amendment that originally contained confusing language, therefore its necessary for MIP64 to amend such language to communicate and incentivize white-hat hackers to look for potential critical web bugs. The increase payouts will also match the payout structure of other bug bounties run by Immunefi. With that in mind, we believe that it is super important to \u201ckeep up with the Joneses\u201d as last week we heard about the Nexus Mutual first matching payout was awarded for a critical vulnerability.

This Declaration covers the essential needs in order for a solution to be consider, including but not limited to requirements pertaining to both legal and investment structures, investment grade, and commonality in liquidity. As proponents of a solution that will help the DAO scale its exposure to  USDC, we are hopeful that interested parties will soon help the community diversify such risk.  Ratification Poll for Facilitators Offboarding (MDS-001) (MIP41c5-SP5) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES as it has been clearly stated by the Team of the Maker Swag Shop that they are stepping down and moving on to other personal goals:  image1526\u00d7254 74.7 KB   Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 as we fully support GovAlpha, one of MakerDAO\u2019s most important components at what we believe is a very inexpensive price. When you assess the team members both FT and PT, and add up this budget request, you clearly realized that GovAlpha has the core values of a team that is servicing the DAO because they have an internal passion for MakerDAO. They have social dignity and integrity. Because of these traits we believe the entire community should continue to support GovAlpha.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 we believe it\u2019s important to support this budget as MakerDAO\u2019s long-awaited attempt at on-boarding Real World Assets finally makes a push in 2022. It is also our believe that if MKR token owners and Delegates do not support this proposal, it will hamper the ability of both the RWF CU and the incoming RWA Legal & Transaction Services (LTS) facilitator to complete the Professional Services required for deals such as the SocGen on-boarding application, and the current pipeline:  image1836\u00d7532 73.9 KB  **  Screeshot was captured during RWF\u2019s office hours on 16/03/2022 The Community does not understand the role of RWF-001 Auditor Wallet: 0x96d7b01Cc25B141520C717fa369844d34FF116ec As we read comment after comment from both the community and Delegates, it became quite apparent to us that the community does not comprehend the role an Auditor Wallet can play in funding a budget, such as the budget request made by RWF. We believe this is a failure of communication between the DAO and its community. There is a Need for the RWF Core Unit Team To Speak Up and Communicate w/the Community The community cannot expect miracles to occur without providing the necessary Runway for Core Units to scale. There has been a miscommunication between RWF and the community, which we believe has led to a misunderstanding on how this Core Unit plans to push RWAs forward. We ask the RWF to communicate as much as possible with the community. This team has added talented team members that we believe will introduce Deals that will take the Real World by surprise. Therefore, we highly recommend that the RWF team members speak up, participate in the community\u2019s conversations and guide the subject of RWAs more efficiently. You\u2019ll Never Get a Breakthrough if You Play it Safe There\u2019s an open question if 2022 will be the year that RWA collateral types will scale. As proponents of Risk taking, we do believe that it is important for the RWF team to allow the likes of Monetalis, 6s Capital, Centrifuge, and other Arranger types to scale via the superpowers of MakerDAO, know as Vaults. We request that both the RWA Project Sandbox incubating core units and the RWF team to work diligently with these MIP applicants and find a middle-ground that will allow the next batch of innovators, to innovate via DAI. After all, as Vinod Kholsa stated, \u201cyour willingness to fail is what will let you succeed.\u201d  Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 the biggest surprised of this MKR budget request was finding out that LongForWisdom has NEVER received MKR as compensation for his work during this Domain Team Era. As a stated above, GovAlpha is made of folks with pure empathy. So, not only is Long\u2019s MKR comp Long-Overdue, but the DAO is getting a Core Unit compose of good folks at a low, low, MKR compensation structure. We urge All to support this Core Unit MKR budget.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network (MIP63c4-SP3) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 as Hexonaut mentioned, all keeper actions are supported by Maker\u2019s Tech-Ops CU, which means that it is currently centralized. The idea here is to gradually decentralize by adding both Gelato and the Keep3r Network as redundancies.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP2) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 as stated above, all keeper actions are supported by Maker\u2019s Tech-Ops CU, which means that it is currently centralized. The idea here is to gradually decentralize by adding both Gelato and the Keep3r Network as redundancies.  Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) - March 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 this Ratification is for consent to payout Bug Bounty Hunters faster for small payouts. It makes sense as whitehats should not have to wait a month, or longer to receive compensation for their dedication in keeping the ecosystem safe.  Ratification Poll for Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) - March 14, 2022 Standing by our Commitment made to the Maker community in October 2021 with regards to Delegate Compensation, we have Voted to Abstain  image1462\u00d7274 90 KB  However, we believe the correct metrics for Delegate compensation is needed if this DAO expects to continue to attract dedicated Delegates that will eat, and breath all-things MakerDAO. Therefore, in the near-future there should be amendments to ratified this MIP. ",

Why is branding so important? One of the most obvious reasons that DeFi protocols need branding is to help them get recognized more often. But in a competitive ecosystem such as decentralized finance, branding makes a memorable impression on consumers but more importantly, it allows your users to know what to expect from your organization. And when you attend the Harvard Blockchain Conference, and some of the attendees tell you that they had no idea MakerDAO is the platform that governs and provides life for DAI to exist, you quickly realized that the branding of both Maker and DAI has been non-existent. And when folks tell you that DAO Maker and MakerDAO are the same protocol that mints DAI, you get this feeling of emptiness but more importantly you wonder what went wrong. The truth is we All know that branding is important. And now the question is, how do we allocate budgets that allow marketing teams to help us brand DAI + MakerDAO as one. While 3F Delegate and the rest of the community does not have sufficient data to analyze if the recent launch of DAIvinity will produce branding, or result in protocol growth\u2013we believe it is necessary to support this event that has the potential to leave a memorable impression on those who believe in both decentralized finance and Web 3. In the near future we are proponents of allocating a budget that is firmed and allows marketing/events teams to work with such without the need to use an SPF, or the budgets of other Core Units. We are also hopeful that co-sponsorships can and will be attained in the near future that will lead to some memorable branding.  Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge - March 28, 2022 Voted YES as we are proponents of StarkNet L2 and are hereby supporting the maximum amount 5M DAI in the L1 bridge contract. We had the pleasure of meeting some members of the StarkWare Community, along with one of the co-founders, a board member, and others alike at the HBC StarkWare Meetup in Boston. A very impressive community who is full-of-energy, ideas, and more importantly they are All excited to finally see the StarkNet vision come into fruition.  Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) - March 28, 2022 Voted YES in supporting the amending of MIP62c2 to MIP62c3 which reflects the off-boarding of the Content CU rather than making entire changes to MIP62. Makes sense.  Investigate Implementation of a Notional Finance D3M - March 28, 2022 Voted NO as much as we would like to see hundreds of D3M implementations, we believe MakerDAO Core Units should stay focused on implementing the current backlog. Time consuming and costly integrations will take a lot of effort and the DAO teams are already overextended. Also, a good analysis of why we currently oppose investigating this implementation and why we believe it felt rushed and not properly analyzed by the proposer is based on this forum post by CES contributor @M_C If we propose a technological integration before discussing the business opportunity we are already discussing the solution instead of the problem. As aspected, CES will play a huge role in helping MKR token owners and Delegates make a free and democratic decision on the onboarding of all collateral types. While we encourage more enthusiastic proposals from the proposer ( a delegate themselves ), we ask that they provide the Maker Community with implementations that make business sense, third-party implementations that are well negotiated and reward MKR token owners. 3F Delegate is a proponent in rewarding MKR token owners with incentives. As the saying goes, the principal\u2019s incentives are different than the agent\u2019s incentives. ",

With the initial assessment leaning to an anemic DC, and most of those concerns being set aside, we are strong supporters of helping this Collateral Type scale. 12 POLLS - ENDING APR 25 2022 16:00 UTC  Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) - April 11, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 The Content Production Core Unit has been off-boarded and  their wallet needs to be removed from the recognized multi-sig list. It will be a challenge to recover the small amount of funds that can still be claimed\u2013will need some technical work\u2013but all in all, this is a good learning lesson for the DAO.  Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022 Voted \u201cYESSSSSSS\u201d to one of the most important components of MakerDAO, PECU. The recent success of MakerDAO can be attributed to the hard work and dedication produced by its Team Members. PECU is arguably the heart-beat of MakerDAO. No doubt about it. We believe that rejecting a budget request from a team that has consistently produced results and has volunteered to take the same salaries as the previous year, will be detrimental to their confidence in believing that Maker Governance will support those that sacrifice their lives in order to protect the DAO. And it will quickly erase any excitement for the hiring of future engineers who seek to one-day build on the most decentralized protocol on Earth. This Team has grown\u2013and we believe some in the community do not recognize, or know about the hidden talent this Core Unit possesses, or the endless sleepless nights they\u2019ve had. We urge MKR token owners and Delegates to please, don\u2019t send PE and other important CU a negative signal to prove a point. More importantly, PE has signal their intent to create a 3-way work-stream composed of Core Protocol, Cross Domain Scaling, and Safety. This initiative needs to be supported as PE believes it will create an efficient work environment. It can also decentralize the Core Unit\u2013which will be a first for this DAO. And we fully agree, and urge every single MKR token owner and Delegate to vote YESSSSSSS.  Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022 Voted \u201cYesssssss\u201d in support of onboarding the entire CES team via the MIP7 onboarding process. If this Poll & subsequent Executive passes, it will Add CES to MIP7c2 to the Current Domain Roles List, which is currently composed of PECU, Oracles CU, Risk, and \u201cLegal.\u201d We support this onboarding as CES has shown a tremendous effort, dedication, and work ethic in trying to solve the collateral onboarding, collateral onboarding, and maintenance process.  Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022 Voted \u201cYes\u201d to modify/Amend the collateral application template. This amendment will add important questions to the MIP6 application that allows CUs, MKR Token Owners, and Delegates to more easily assess if a collateral type is qualified to be onboarded. With the need to help both MKR token owners and Delegates greenlight MIP6 applicants, this modification finally aids those that have ask for the much needed help.  Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022 Voted \u201cYES,\u201d in support of a methodology that will implement checks and balances\u2013a benchmark that will help attract quality borrowers and clarifies the necessary frameworks needed in order to onboard RWA collateral types. This framework will also help align and communicate to the world, the necessary requirements needed in order to become an RWA collateral type. We believe implementing a framework that hails MakerDAO as a senior secured lender with favorable rights for loan transactions. This will help the DAO determine what course of action it should take when a Default occurs. It will also help the RWF CU, incubating LOVE-01 CU, and proposed Legal CU create assessments that can determine if the MIP6 applicant has the ability to pay Stability Fees and principal under the terms of the legal/deal documents. Without an RWA methodology, we believe MakerDAO will not be taken serious as a Real World Lender. And because we believe that some digital asset will become global powerhouses, DAI must be showcased as a digital asset that has the ability to compete on the World\u2019s stage. MIP67 will help real world financing companies understand the requirements needed in order to access DAI RWA Vaults, a powerful tool. It will also help showcase the current RWA Core Units team members years of experience in selecting the right projects, and structuring RWA deals in a correct manner. However, let\u2019s not forget that MKR token owners will always have the final say. 3F Delegate is a proponent of implementing a secondary RWA Core Unit that will provide incoming RWA startups the ability to access the powerful tools of MakerDAO. This secondary Core Unit will inspired the next Generation MIP6 applicants to showcase themselves. Perhaps a former employee of a successful borrower who acquired the expertise and is now ready to explore uncharted waters. Such CU should follow a different Methodology that allows entrepreneurs the access and the freedom to perform lending best practices via Maker Vaults. After all, MakerDAO was built by taking-on Risk. And finally, we cannot begin to tell you how many times we have been ask by personal connections hailing from TradFi organizations, as to why MakerDAO is giving out risk-free loans? Some sounded baffled\u2013as they proceeded to deviate from further discussing if MakerDAO is a serious lender. And it\u2019s these misconception that can easily attract fraudulent borrowers. The MakerDAO community cannot afford to take on risks that it cannot afford. The off-chain world is opaque, and many borrowers are inexperienced. Defaults will happen. With a Surplus Buffer that allows this DAO to take minimal off-chain risk, there\u2019s no viable reason why MIP67 should not be supported. ",

That feeling that showcases our innovative freedom. That feeling of being reborn. Free to roam the streets. It is because of this feeling that MakerDAO is publicly started to communicate again, thanks to this proposed Core Unit team.  Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) - April 11, 2022.

On a weekend when we are seeing platforms like Bastion (Compound Fork) garner $800M++ of TVL in less than 30-days, we ask ourselves what can Fix Yield platforms offer to the Growth of MakerDAO? And quite frankly, there is no Market appetite for such product. Let\u2019s be honest, Fix Yield is not viable today. Maybe tomorrow.  But not today.

As you know, the most important responsibilities of COM-001 are to set the tone for messaging and portraying values of the DAO. As you know that COM-001 is responsible for establishing relationships with media outlets, developing strategic communication plans and handling public relations issues that arise internally and externally. Other duties include the task of establishing a multi-channel communications strategy, and establishing and maintains contacts with media members, influencers, and community leaders. And some duties can also involve marketing and content creation. And as you also know, public  perception is key. And after further review, I believe COM-001 has fallen short. And I partially blame it on perhaps the current  budget\u2014maybe it was insufficient. I also blame it on the fact that you\u2019re a small team and the off-boarding of the content Core Unit impacted your ability to produce the creation of digital, video, and audio communication material. I also believe your budget request ( prop 62 & 63 ) are excessive when you compare the budget request from teams like GovAlpha. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault\u2014I believe it\u2019s a combination of not having the proper resources  to structure a specific budget that will contain too much expectations. I also believe that perhaps you lack the inexperience of running a business, and the expectations that delegates had from COM-001 have fallen short. On occasions I have personally felt disappointed that no communication was made public with regards to MakerDAO accomplishments, and equally the communication of our disappointments. We have lacked communication related to our products, and perhaps a written, or verbal explanation of the complexities of running a DAO (the forum has been a battlefield). This DAO needed Your Core Unit then more than ever. And  I should have spoken up and communicated my disappointment. But I did not and this is why it pains me to tell you that 3F Delegate cannot support prop 62, 63 and the  COM-001 mandate refresh. I wanted to support you, personally\u2014because you are talented and I know you are a piece of the MakerDAO heartbeat. But I have to be honest and tell you that I would be lying to myself if I supported COM-001 based on your personal talents as oppose to what works best for the DAO. And I don\u2019t believe myself and other delegates believe that COM-001 produces sufficient value for the requested budget allocation. I believe you should revisit your budget and propose a better path forward that can and will deliver the expected results. ",

I was also able to talk to some of the other Maker teams that are attending DevConnect and they expressed their support and the value that DIN\u2013001 provides. Furthermore, from our visit to DevConnect we have realized that there\u2019s currently a slim pool of talent available for the MANY projects that are deploying on a daily basis. And when you have Polygon Studio deploying a $100M Fund for the development of their ecosystem, you better have your A-Game ready for retaining and hiring talent.

IF this proposal passes, I ask Delegates and MKR token owners to diligently monitor their progress. They are currently led by a Part-time Facilitator and we believe this will not work. A Core Unit needs a Facilitator who is 100% focus on the success of his team.

We also request that DIN-001 should also consider using other Data warehouses/sources outside of Token Flow Insights. We request a PoC for building an RWA Dashboard, among others. If this Budget passes, we expect to see this delivered and presented to the community ASAP. We also request that this team create more content of what it is accomplishing on a weekly basis. We also request that this team run workshops for both the CU Teams and the community. Please keep the community, MKR token owners, and Delegates informed Showcase your talent. ",

And while the D3M will kickstart a new method of RWA funding, this nascent science of funding RWA collateral types will take time while RWA applicants decipher the ever-changing landscape of onboarding via an already slow-moving Governance process, and a trajectory that has thrown more curveballs at MIP6 applicants than Tom Seaver threw in the 1969 World Series.  ATCD is in a Clean Money State of mind. Every country is in need of strengthening the resilience of their supply-chains. Unfortunately, the CapEx of strengthening their LNG infrastructure and building those proposed pipelines within Europe will be EXPENSIVE. But more importantly these supply-chain resilient tasks will also need to offset emissions as the discussion on the energy transition to a carbon-neutral world gathers pace and strength. And we believe ATCD can position itself as key player in reducing the carbon footprint while reducing energy costs. Please let us participate in this world-changing task, as oppose to taking the easy road and overlooking the clean intentions of this project. We ask that this ATCD deal be explored more, beyond a MIP Forum post with numbers and words. Because our reliance on the environment is more substantial than the current Fed Funds rate.    Community Greenlight Poll - IPCL (India Power Green Bonds) - May 2, 2022 Voted YES to the prospect of further investigating a company (India Power) that hails from a country (India) that has an impressive energy transformation currently underway. India is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2070. That my dear community is impressive. When you couple that with the fact that people in India consume less Energy than citizens of the United States and renewable electricity is growing at a faster rate in India than any other major economy\u2013MakerDAO would be insane not to at least investigate this opportunity to fund India Power\u2019s renewable projects with DAI. We don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve yet to have a sit-down with India Power. Come on folks, let\u2019s talk, let\u2019s negotiate, let\u2019s make an effort to help change the world. Also, we need to explore if this deal can get RBI (Reserve Bank of India) approval. How can MakerDAO + DAI reach the minds & eyes of billions of India\u2019s citizens, if we don\u2019t even try?  To underwrite, or not to underwrite. That is the Question. The recent recommendations pertaining to these two (2) MIP6 applications leaves us wondering if the current RWF Core Unit is indicating that MakerDAO should not underwrite deals. This is an unclear message that needs to be communicated more clearly for the benefit of MKR token owners. We believe that the community\u2019s expectations are that the RWF CU will conduct an independent investigation of the issuer and the issue. These are the same expectations shareholders have of underwriters like GS, JPM, Credit Suisse, etc., hence\u2013we have the same expectations. If this Core Unit does not believe that \u201cunderwriting\u201d will be beneficial to MakerDAO, this needs to openly communicated to the Community. We are open-minded. Furthermore, MKR token owners have expectations that RWF CU will focus on providing up-to-date information, details of trends, and present status of current collateral types, along with \u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d (let\u2019s get out there). Communicate any due-diligence that is hampered by the borrower/applicant, corrections, clarifications, and modifications. These are some of the expectations we have going into the latter half of 2022. ",

This MIP also allows MakerDAO to gain exposure to professional bond managers and it entails allocation restrictions that might not comply with the DAO\u2019s Clean Money Initiative and MKR token owners objectives. We also believe the commitment to deliver any Surplus back to the DAO on a quarterly basis is beneficial as only a few RWA Collateral Types to date have generated an ROI. We are also excited to greet and meet some qualified and a mix of bond managers in the near future, as we are believers that this MIP65 proposal by Monetalis will deliver results.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending (MIP68) - May 9, 2022 Voted YES to a Lending Strategy named after the elegant Lusitano horse breed that possesses  strong nerves and the agile adoption to attain the rider\u2019s requirements. MIP68 consist of portfolios that will align with the Clean Money vision, and will create opportunities including market-making in the Climate-financing market, while keeping Maker Senior. With big Finance starting to go green and Pension Funds starting to divest from fossil-fuel firms, the Big Automobile manufacturers committing to building more EVs in order to become carbon neutral, we believe Lusitano can be the first SME lending platform that can position MakerDAO as an early beneficiary of the climate market momentum. With the passing of this MIP\u2013MakerDAO can position itself as the lead for the development of new generation climate-markets. We also believe that Monetalis has done the necessary research and due-diligence to structure a Lending Vehicle that contains the necessary checks & balances via MIP21. This includes but its not limited to the verification of a Professional Trustee by the incubating Legal CU, a cash and security agent, auditor, custodian, and legal advisor. All these key pieces need to work together in order to provide MKR token owners reports and evaluations on the success of Lusitano. This approach also allows the platform to be flexible, in order to diversify MakerDAO\u2019s exposure to one single point of failure. All-in-all we are betting on the Jockey and not the Horse. We move to Vote YES.  Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) - May 9, 2022 Voted YES to the long-waited release of the Maker Teleport and MIP69 calls for requestMint via a fast withdraw of DAI from L2  to L1 that burns DAI on L2 and sends an L2 \u2192 L1 message to withdraw DAI from the L2 bridge without an operatorFee. We are super excited to witness the Maker Teleport go live.  Ratification Poll for MIP40 Budget Process Amendment (MIP4c2-SP19) - May 9, 2022 Voted YES to this amendment that will hopefully improve budget future proposals and requests. We do believe that Core Units might find the structure a bit overwhelming, but we believe MKR token owners can decide if a Core Unit budget proposal/request is acceptable even if the MIP40 proposal is delivered \u201csomewhat\u201d incomplete via this process. While we welcome the amendment to improve the process, we don\u2019t believe it will make it that much easier for Delegates and MKR token owners to decide if the requested budget amounts are justifiable. We will continue to lean on the help of our Core Units and the MIP Author (SF CU), but perhaps this process will make it that much easier. However, this amendment does allow MKR token owners to keep-up with Core Unit head-counts (at times extremely opaque), business continuity, CU objectives, and how a Core Unit can be wound-down in the event of a Governance vote to defund it (extremely important). Therefore we move to support this amendment by Voting YES.  Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) - May 9, 2022 Fully Support this Core Unit that is in the business of spreading MakerDAO love   & happiness via swag airdrops(a.k.a branding), a man who is willing to go the distance to make sure Maker\u2019s presence is felt at some of the Top-Events in the ecosystem. We have witness this Facilitator go the extra mile, carry boxes of swag across borders, on commercial flights, on a family-minivan, negotiate his way into a foreign jurisdiction (Customs) in order to deliver MakerDAO Happiness, all while spending his own personal money to make it happen. It is our pleasure to fully support a Core Unit that eats, breaths, and dreams about MKR. We Vote YES to MIP40c3-SP67! ",

Current market condition being unpredictable and MKR being accumulated by centralized exchanges leads us to believe that this ESM threshold should be included in an Executive ASAP. Also, the addition of the immutable circuit breaker with updated disarmament instructions approximately four months ago is key in this uncertain environment.

We believe the Origination Fee (1% of DAI minted) offers MakerDAO initial and much needed upside, while the discounted SF rate of 50 bips for ETH-A / WBTC-A vaults offers a new paradigm of deal-structuring for IV vaults in the near future. And as the SR indicated, the majority of the community believes this deal needs to be investigated further.  Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH - May 23, 2022 Voted NO, as the current economic environment will continue to be treacherous and credit markets will continue to deteriorate as inflation will be the main driver of rate hikes across the world as many are starting to compare the current environment to the 1970\u2019s period of recession + stagflation (equity returns were negative), couple with the future pivot to the Endgame Plan that will introduce MATH (Maker + Ethereum synthetic), we believe the timing to deploy the MakerDAO balance sheet for the accumulation of ETH is incorrect. We are in a period where there\u2019s a demand and supply for credit that is having an effect of moving us into a stagflation environment (slow growth, and high asset pricing, a.k.a. as inflation). There might be a time when this proposal can be revisited, but right now is not the time.  Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022 Voted NO, as we are active users of Stargate, Hop, Optimism/Arbitrum/Polygon bridge, the list goes on and on\u2013they ALL charge a fee. Hence, why as an active user would I use a NEW bridge? Only one reason\u2013it\u2019s FREE. This one particular word, \u201cFREE\u201d is a huge marketing tool. Let\u2019s use it to kickstart Maker Teleport and avoid being penny smart, pound foolish.  Active Polls 1 POLL - ENDING MAY 30 2022 16:00 UTC  Community Greenlight Poll - FEI (Fei USD) - May 16, 2022 Voted NO, as we don\u2019t believe that a Vault or PSM should be consider for a Stablecoin that is still searching for scalable network effects, while our Core Units are left identifying the metrics, utilization, risks (like Chainlink Oracles) and business opportunities for the benefit of MakerDAO. Also, a D3M would incur more work for our Core Units (integration risk management) while not providing much DAI supply and the Surplus Buffer remains low, which means that MKR token owners will feel most of the Pain if there\u2019s a loss (TRIBE token owners should also foot the bill for any losses). However, as a proponent of innovation\u2013we ask the FEI community to reinvestigate how both protocols can work together and present a sandbox that benefits both equally. We believe that D3M applicants should also put in the work when applying for such. ",

Even with a low Stability Fee of 300 basis points this collateral type has struggle to gain any traction. It\u2019s time to move on to greener pastures. Please note that the parameters that are being proposed here (liquidation penalty to 0%, debt ceiling to 0, set tip to 0, etc.) might not be sufficient to incur liquidations. Vault owners might choose to increase their CR to avoid liquidations.  Offboarding Parameters for UNIV2DAIETH-A - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to off-boarding another collateral type that has struggled to gain any traction throughout much of it\u2019s existence. On this day, only 137K of DAI is currently minted/generated from this Vault. As stated above, the parameters that are being proposed here (liquidation penalty to 0%, debt ceiling to 0, set tip to 0, etc.) might not be sufficient to incur liquidations.

Offboarding Parameters for UNIV2WBTCETH-A - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to another laggard that we believe needs to be removed as a collateral type.

Offboarding Parameters for UNIV2UNIETH-A - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to the off-boarding of a Uniswap LP token pair that has generated less SFs than Oracle costs. Enough said.  Offboarding Parameters for UNIV2WBTCDAI-A - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to another laggard that has 400K of collateral deposited into this Vault Type, with an outstanding amount of 189K DAI.   It\u2019s time to remove all these unprofitable LP tokens.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - May 30, 2022 Voted YES as the MOMC has taken their foot off the gas pedal and is allowing market rates to settle-in, as the market regains its footing. Notably, this proposal calls for the reduction of DC for WSTETH-A , and the D3M for AAVEV2-DAI which make sense. Otherwise, and increase in the MANA-A DC which saves the community the pain of going through a Signal Request to increase such. Good move MOMC.  Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c7-SP2 - Modify Oracle Data Models - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to this modification that will remove and add oracle data models that will strengthen queries of price feeds for BTC/USD, YFI/USD,USDT/USD, LINK/USD, and MANA/USD. It has a mix of removing and adding CEXes and DEXes, from FTX and Binance to Balancer and Uniswap for the improvement of oracle data models.  Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c19-SP1 - Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles - May 30, 2022 Voted YES to this cost-saving initiative by the Oracles CU. This is a MacGyver move by this team that entails cutting oracle costs by extending the expiration time from \u201c15,500 seconds to 24 hours\u201d. If this does lead to savings with low-low technical risk(as stated by Oracles CU), it is  indeed a superb move.

We also agree with MOMC recommendations to decrease the AAVE D3M bar to 275 basis points as the need to continue to keep DAI at an attractive Target Borrow Rate is highly needed in the current environment.

                    "content": " Active Polls 3 POLLS - ENDING JUN 16 2022 16:00 UTC  Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 Right now the ecosystem has a lot to deal with including the current depleting crypto market conditions and the opaque macro environment that has led to decentralized finance conditions deteriorated further and faster than expected. When this Proposal was first made, market conditions were uncertain and MakerDAO needed a spark, a way to reward MKR owners. Since then, MKR token value has contracted ~40% and the value of ETH has dropped by ~35% in the span of 20 trading sessions. As history has thought us, PLCs that bought back equity during growth cycles and entered a cycle of uncertainty, those companies that spent billions of dollars on share buybacks over previous years\u2013they\u2019ve struggled with little cash on had. And we understand that this Proposal\u2019s burn rate at the proposed configuration would result in roughly 33K DAI being burned daily, but that amount of money can be used to minimize Risk and work on the upcoming protocol Growth Initiatives, with an emphasis on educating the masses of what exactly is MakerDAO. The DssKiln is a terrific purchasing and disposition tool and we know one-day it will be put to good use, and eventually automate the permissionless purchasing of MKR and other treasury assets. At the moment, we believe the Community should NOT be focused on extracting value, but instead focus on minimizing risk and maximizing quality Growth.  Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT - June 13, 2022 Voted YES to this new AMM Optimism platform that has airdropped its $VELO governance token to DAO supporters, among others. This layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum will include a trading and liquidity marketplace designed to provide deep liquidity and low fee/slippage trades. The airdropped tokens can be locked for veVELO, which provides voting rights and conforms to the ERC-721 standard (i.e., veNFT). This proposal will target the DAI/USDC and DAI/OP pairs and send any incurred rewards to the MakerDAO Optimism Governance Address.  Add rETH as a new Vault Type - June 13, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 this is too small of a Collateral Type with too much required involvement by Risk CU (who sounds like the proposed parameter of DC-IAM gap: 3m is meh, just enough risk mitigation to keep MakerDAO safe), Protocol Engineering, Oracles (who did not sound too excited about this collateral type, and finally Collateral Engineering Services who has a pile of irons in the fire. And all this work for 225 basis points. While All of these resources combined can be used to focus on tackling the collateral types that will keep this train moving forward, and mitigate risk to keep Maker sailing.  Community Greenlight Poll - KREDIKA (Kredika LTD) - June 6, 2022 Voted NO because currently the pipeline for RWF is too inundated with proposals that we believe require more bandwidth. We also believe these type of proposal eat a ton-of-resources from a Team that\u2019s struggling to get RWAs of the ground. The MakerDAO community has already endured painless months of trying to onboard the SG Forge collateral. Let\u2019s work on the current pipeline and let\u2019s streamline the RWA onboarding collateral process so that the DAO can immediately incur revenues and set a positive precedent for All future applicants. We ask Kredika to re-apply at a later date once we have expanded the RWA bandwidth and the onboarding process has improved 10X. Otherwise, a \u201cgreenlight\u201d from MKR token owners and Delegates will only inundate you with obstacles. Trust us, it\u2019s currently not a fun experience.  Community Greenlight Poll - XSGD (StraitsX) - June 6, 2022 Voted NO to XSGD, a Singapore-dollar backed stablecoin that is fully Fiat collateralized. We believe MakerDAO has enough centralized Fiat exposure via the PSM and that exposure more than likely will grow, as Circle\u2019s USDC is out there designing their strategy to 100x in the next 2 to 5 years. 2 POLLS - ENDING JUN 27 2022 16:00 UTC  Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022 Voted for ONLY 1 Choice:  REJECT TASK FORCE \u2013 My first reaction to the Name \u201cTask Force\u201d hit home because I reside from a City that uses multiple Task Forces to implement centralized control over particular Governmental initiatives. Task Force is identified by many here as not being community friendly; therefore supporting a second Ranked-Choice (IRV) for a proposal that my brain interprets as a negative connotation left me unmotivated to select a second choice. However, since this MIP proposal was presented to the community, I have given it the benefit of the doubt and tried to understand it. Using my business logic, I don\u2019t believe that this \u201cTask Force\u201d has drawn-out a decentralized network-theory that convinces how their vision of Growth will start decentralizing  locally (within the Maker Community), and then spreading a vision with the involvement of the entire ecosystem. And in order to convince MKR token owners that you have the team, the idea, and the credibility to make this initiative work, FAST\u2013you will put yourself in a position where you\u2019re going to draw-it-up as you move\u2013without a decentralized consensus\u2013and more than likely you\u2019re just trapping yourselves in a network that will never hyper-accelerate. This opinion is one of many reasons that made this proposal feel rushed and quite frankly caught many community members by surprise. Therefore, we move to Reject.  Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001 - @psychonaut (MIP41c4-SP34) - June 13, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 Originally when @SES-Core-Unit recommended Joshua Pritikin for Deputy Facilitator we were surprised. I have been with Josh in this very community since the Rocket Chat days and he has his own believes that can be creative and perhaps unique. All in all as a participant of this community he has been treat to have. And since we believe SES must have made an assessment of the prospect, we agreed and supported the Vote to add Josh as Deputy Facilitator of IS-001. When Josh decided to create the Delegate Compensation I was taken-back that @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and the Maker Community allowed the MIP to flow through without questioning much of it. I say this because that was a pivotal moment in decentralizing and scaling MKR delegated voting. And since, 3F Delegate decided to Abstain from Delegate Comp commentary and polling, I was really surprised the MIP was put to a vote. But okay\u2026 Again, we believe Josh is a dedicated Maker Community Member. That can never be questioned. However, a good facilitator is focused on the topics at hand that pertain to his/her Core Unit, and the optimal path to reach and communicate his/her Core Unit objectives. We believe Josh has not deliver these requirements. When you\u2019re a facilitator you should more than likely disclosed that your post is your personal Opinion and not the voice of your Core Unit.  If you spend all-of-your time on this Forum and the community realm, you might have come across 1 or 2 opinions by Josh that might leave you a bit baffled. And since Josh is currently a Deputy Facilitator for one of our very expensive and important Core Unit Teams, his judgment has lacked. All community members in order to be consider for a Core Unit Facilitator role should have better judgement and if you disagree with this Vote you need to ask yourself, what exactly is the role of a Facilitator?  You should look it up. Or, you can take my word for it  A facilitator needs to be a Motivator, a peacemaker, a guide, bridge builder, and among other things a praiser. And Josh lacks these traits as a Deputy Facilitator of the Immunefi Core Unit. And there\u2019s nothing wrong w/being a Core Unit member who\u2019s outspoken and once in a while makes judgements that  don\u2019t support the mission of makerDAO, but as a Facilitator of a MakerDAO Core Unit\u2026 those are some of the important skills that every facilitator needs to possess. And believe me! I know Josh has a unique skill-set that can help this DAO move forward. But the clairvoyant uniqueness of a Facilitator is missing for Josh. We move to vote No. ",

We were able to spend a lot time with Tadeo at ETHAmsterdam and understood his passion for Maker and his commitment to make sure this CU can deliver the expectations that are needed. We believe this team composed of Piotrek and Leo has the ability to go beyond expectations and surprising the community will be their defining moment.  Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 Voted YES to the onboarding of the Lending Oversight CU based on the skillset that this team can provide to MakerDAO. Their understanding of structure finance, the PE markets, valuations and financial modeling will be key in performing these needed services once Real-World Assets become more institutionalized. This Core Unit needs to be valued for what they can provide, and not because the immediate reaction is that they\u2019ll \u201cgate-keep\u201d any RWA collaterals from being onboarded. Let the MKR token owners decide what they believe is best for MakerDAO, and only accept their assessment  as just that. An opinion. Because at the end of the day, the Markets, our users, our partners, and our willingness to fail is what will decide our success.  Ratification Poll for Task Forces (MIP75) - June 13, 2022. Voted NO, as stated in our review of the Ratification Poll for the onboarding of a Growth Task Force, we will not be supporting components of MakerDAO that are titled with what we beloieve is a negative connotation. More importantly it is currently not the right time to deploy \u201cteams\u201d that will be in need of funding while the market remains wary from a deleveraging contagion.  Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 we believe the timing is incorrect as the entire DeFi ecosystem contains too much counterparty risk. Currently DAI yield generation strategies are anemic. We request for SF to take time to create a reassessment once the dust clears and pounce on ideas that are unique and innovative. The stars will never be aligned, but there\u2019s always tomorrow to rebrand and reintroduce this idea.  Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022 Voted YES to these much need amendment that we believe works really well as it will have 2-weekly gov cycles running simultaneously.  Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 Voted YES to this MIP that incorporates a very unique tool called the DssKiln that can be used to manage the surplus buffer, treasury, or any other assets on Maker\u2019s balance sheet. Although I might not agree that deploying it right now to burn MKR is the way to go, I do believe the DssKiln module is an innovative tool that will be very useful in the near future. Therefore we move to support it.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 1st CHOICE: Approve existing budget only (business as usual) As Raekwon once said, \u201cTimes are rough and tough like leather.\u201d And I believe Startegic Finance would agree that this is the right path. There will be a day when this team will grow 10x, but for now let\u2019s use the resources available until we start firing on all cylinders. Otherwise, this CU has done a terrific job and has been very vocal in supporting the growth of the protocol. We are lucky to have this team and it\u2019s only a matter of time before MKR token owners and Delegates provide them with the necessary tools to expand their vision.  Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) - June 13, 2022 Voted YES in support of a much needed addition, as the push to decentralize the keepers and lower the dependency from TechOps to provide such services.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 Voted for 1st Choice:  Approve increased budget (BearMarket) Voted for 2nd Choice: Approve existing budget only (BrandlessGrowth) I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the trajectory the Growth Team is taking now that it is adding/moving to branding and marketing. Since this idea was presented by Growth to the community, I\u2019ve personally have had a difficult time understanding how a \u201cBusiness Development\u201d team takes over Marketing. On one hand I get that some organizations lump-together the sales team with a marketing team. But my personal desire to see more sales coming through the door, are a lot more important than marketing. The preference for 3F Delegate is more Sales. Yes, marketing is also needed. Desperately. But there\u2019s nothing in the world like closing deals. At the same token, I also understand that if the EndGame is the pivot that MKR token owners and Delegates decide upon, this Team won\u2019t have a clear vision. Therefore, we move to Poll for an increase in the budget during an opaque environment (\u201cBearMarket\u201d) and ask the Growth team to close deals. Sales are desperately needed. And I know it\u2019s tough out there, but a BD team never stops closing. Regardless if it\u2019s sunny, raining, or snowing. ",

The latter is worrisome as 3F Delegate WILL ALWAYS support, in what we believe is the founding Ethos of MakerDAO, and that is to become a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization that is fully automated and unstoppable. Since late 2018, I cannot remember a single day that I have not follow the development of both MakerDAO and the DeFi Ecosystem. More importantly, during those crypto winter days there was always unity within the MakerDAO community. It felt like something special was being built. There was always something new to learn, something new to feel excited about. We had giga-brain community members that would stimulate your mind and leave you with exhilarating thinking of the future development of MakerDAO. Those days are no longer here. It has become a power struggle between conflicting personalities that are both anonymous/pseudonymous characters, both known and unknown community members from both sides of the aisle, MKR token members who don\u2019t participate, and servants of the DAO (Delegates, Core Units team members, etc.).  It has become a gigantic soup of gumbo that the late Anthony Bourdain would have tasted once and never recommended. It is for this reason that we choose to Abstain and do not wish to virtue signal in either direction. This Vote is no longer about the competency of the Core Unit in question, or pure analysis for the possibility that off-chain Real World Assets will never scale via MIP21. It is 100% a Virtue Signaling Contest. 100% about formulating party lines that 3F Delegate will not support. We have communicated that 3F Delegate is 100% committed to the ENDGAME Party.  And we believe the Virtue Signaling game that is being played on this Poll is an Attack on our Party, and some might even argue\u2026 an attack on Decentralization. We will ALWAYS support decentralization. This is a hill worth dying on.

Unfortunately though that is one of the benefits and challenges of a growing and well established DAO. Having these power struggles and conflicting personalities just proves that the DAO is working as a DAO and that at the end of the day the community decides in which direction it wants to go in. Having said that though, one thing I have noticed is the amount of different CUs that form that could roll up under a bigger CU unit. This MIP is a perfect example of that, I believe most of the community would agree that Lending Oversight\u2019s primary objectives would be beneficial to the success of MakerDAO but that does not mean its need its own CU. This function could roll up into either the Real World Finance Unit or Strategic Finance Unit or an MIP to request an expansion of those units could be better than having siloed teams focusing on very narrow objectives. Instead expanding CU\u2019s to incorporate new enhancements or divisions would be beneficial in terms of team collaboration, accountability, competing priorities, shared budget, among many other things. Among the better benefits of expanding CUs is that existing members and the community are able to \u201cvet\u201d the new member to assess their capability based on actual credentials instead of it being based on ideas, likes, comments and how active they are in the forum. Not sure this is possible today, but there should be a way to understand if the formation of a new CU would actually be better placed within an existing CU given the benefits, mentioned above. ",

One idea is that when there is a newly proposed CU, it should be presented to an existing CU that has similar mandates, skill sets and objectives. The facilitator of that existing CU should do an evaluation of the proposed CU to determine if it should go into theirs, and if not, explain why. The key would be to not make this process a political burden or time suck for facilitators but rather an objective, standardized analysis that can be done somewhat easily and presented to the community. This would not prevent a new CU to continue to go through a process and vote, but to add some insight from mandated actors in areas where there could be CU minimization to the benefit of the DAO. ",

Those that reversed their position to vote with Rune, on the other hand, got a hefty bonus to their delegation. I believe in Occam\u2019s Razor: the simplest explanation is often the most likely. Of course, Rune is entitled to delegate to whoever he likes. But when we have just a single person dictating (essentially) the salaries and compensation of most delegates, because he can pull their MKR if they don\u2019t vote with him, the integrity of the delegate system is at stake. This issue is definitely worth a separate thread/conversation at some point IMO @prose11 @Patrick_J. I know this isn\u2019t a new problem, but with Rune more hands-on now - clearly applying pressure through actively shifting his delegations - there might be a need to redefine what it means to be an independent delegate, for instance in terms of transparency requirements.

But like many in this community, after more than a few sleepless nights, I needed to take  a break from the Maker Forum. I believe MakerDAO\u2019s infinite game is to provide permissionless financial enablement for the greater good of the world. With that in mind, as an MKR Delegate I need to believe in a vision that helps this DAO accomplish a core mission that the community is passionate about. And I believe the EndGame vision is currently the best path forward. I hope the entire community, MKR token owners, and the MakerDAO Core Units will buy-in. As you know this Poll was about onboarding a Core Unit team. When thinking about how Core Units will be successful, I want to start with the Core Unit Facilitator. As mentioned in other forum post, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that @luca_pro has the experience for running an RWA oversight team. But as a Facilitator, we needed to break that down and see if Luca as a facilitator was virtue signaling the qualities that only a few facilitators have ever possessed in this DAO. Think Derek Flossman, LongForWisdom, David U, Payton Rose, Denis of DUX, etc. So, let\u2019s go through a breakdown of what is the Role of a Facilitator: For REFERENCE:  Facilitator Framework   Bridge Builder: One of the strongest roles of a facilitator is to be a bridge builder between it\u2019s Core Unit and the Community. The Facilitator must create and maintain a safe and open environment for sharing ideas. Where other people see differences, the facilitator must find and use similarities to establish a foundation for building bridges to consensus. Over the last 2-weeks, I believe the incubating LOVE CU facilitator has gotten away from building bridges. I would love to see a reset and with a focus on uniting the community.   Motivator: CU Facilitators should  ignite a fire within the community, establish momentum, and keep the pace. Over the last 2-weeks, I believe the LOVE CU facilitator has forgotten that the role of a facilitator should be to ignite the community in a positive way.   Clairvoyant: I believe that a Facilitator should watch carefully for signs of potential strain, weariness, aggravation, and disempowerment\u2014and respond in advance to avoid dysfunctional behavior.   Peacemaker: I believe a Facilitator should to avoid a direct confrontation between participants, should such an event occur, you must quickly step in, reestablish order, and direct the group toward a constructive resolution.   A promise is a promise ( the answers to my Questions are still pending) Over the last 7-days I dove deep into the work @luca_pro has provided while incubating via SES. I read some of the recent work his Team Member @August provided to the DAO. I must admit the write-ups showcase the talent that this team has. However, I felt the author/CU team member had made an error when describing some of the components of MIP21. Hence, after reading the assessment I had some questions.  image1780\u00d71364 153 KB  Obviously with Luca so focus on trying to get his Core Unit onboarded my Question to this day has never been answered. But that\u2019s okay. I get it. But it\u2019s also a \u201cTell\u201d (hopefully you play poker). I don\u2019t believe this Core Unit was structure correctly. When it was incubated, SES should have immediately identified that Luca is a Deal Maker, and not a Facilitator. With that mind, if this Vote was about the Core Unit, and not the Politics, do you really believe this Core Unit was formatted correctly? Do you want Luca to be a facilitator at a negotiation table, or do you want him to be a Closer? I believe Luca has the skillset of a closer. And the entire community including myself, and SES missed this completely. And we failed at formulating a Core Unit that is focused on doing lending oversight. If we  allowed a core unit to exist that is in the business of performing political pushes\u2013that to me is a total Fail. ",

Of course, the whole idea is that delegates represent their MKR holder\u2019s interests. I was just pointing out that when a single MKR holder is responsible for the majority of the delegation for most delegates, it might be a good idea for (eg) stronger norms around transparency: distinguishing between votes where delegates are being \u2018whipped\u2019 to vote a certain way, versus votes where they are exercising their full discretion.

Here is how we believe the 500M USDC from the PSM should be allocated between strategies. 1st Rank Choice: US Short Treasuries (80%)+ IG Corp Bond(20%) Comments: Fed interest rate policy remains the key market support. We believe investors will continue to focus on the current hawkish Fed policy, as rates are likely to remain relatively low compared to the 1970s/1980s, and yes even after possible future rate hikes are incurred. Therefore, we believe the allocation should include Investment Grade Corporate Bonds as we believe the protocol should take a risk-on stance by focusing on credits with durable free cash flow and solid balance sheets. 2nd Rank Choice:  US Short Treasuries (100%) Comments: U.S. Treasury yields continue to provide decent fixed income returns, though recession fears also deliver volatile price action. Overall we believe the economic outlook remains healthy, as consumers have strong \u201cbalance sheets\u201d, and businesses are reinvesting as Covid finally dissipates. Thankfully. All-in-all, we believe either strategy is a step in the right direction. ",

                    "content": " Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022 Kicking it off with 1st rank choice: Sagittarius Engine, all day every day. This was the original most anticipated moment in MakerDAO history that has gotten us to the EndGame\u2013how did the Sag Engine change the game to the EndGame? Only your deep understanding and drilling down of the MetaDAO structures will ever allow you comprehend. So, get out on the frontier and understand the Endgame as oppose to opposing the one and only game changer that\u2019s live today. 2nd rank choice: Collateral Onboarding is a no-brainer as we believe crypto tokens will continue to be influential, but will struggle to take DeFi to the promise land. The scaling of collaterals is destined to be via Real World Assets, from bonds to credit \u2013 it\u2019ll happen somewhere in between\u2013and with or without Maker it will be solved and it will scale. Let\u2019s make sure Maker is not excluded. 3rd rank choice: Compound D3M \u2013  while we are huge proponents of scaling the D3M via different DeFi platforms, we are aware that such venues like Compound might not result in the best outcome  for MKR token owners. I think there\u2019s a huge difference between scaling products for the benefit of MKR token owners, and scaling for the benefit of DAI growth proponents. Our community needs to understand the two differential outcomes of scaling a module that benefits DAI expansion, or MKR ROI. 4th rank choice: Maker Teleport \u2013 as big proponent and believers in a cross-chain world, we believe the Maker Teleport has been a forgotten module. Could have easily been top 2, as last year I would have placed a bet that bridging was the one-thing that made the most media headlines in 2021. Boy were we wrong. Here\u2019s to 2023 being the year.  Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022 1st rank choice goes to Real-World Assets Vaults, as we continue to believe that DeFi allows an opaque industry to finally have an open permissionless ledger that allows everyone to inspect and have access to real-world lending structures. This is why I believe RWAs are a game-changer and MakerDAO needs to be a pioneer of on-chain credit + debt structures. 2nd rank choice goes to Real-World Asset Arrangers, as we believe MetaDAO structures will allow RWA arrangers to compete and bring the best RWA asset management in the universe. For sure, there\u2019s a lot of open questions how MetaDAOs will work, but I believe in due time if we keep an open mind and an endless eagerness to change the status quo\u2013we can scale this vision 1000x. 3rd rank choice Core Crypto Collateral  the core mission of MakerDAO and never to be forgotten. We believe that crypto collateral types can only get better, but MakerDAO will continue to be selective as its become a lot more difficult to find pure decentralized crypto collateral types that can scale into the hundreds of millions.

All three come with a tip/chop of 0/0%\u2013disallowing farming of liquidation rewards. It\u2019s sad to see these collateral types lack demand and negative cash flow.

Inc. (NASDAQ Listed: HVBC). We believe Huntingdon Valley Bank, along with members of the CES, RWF, incubating LTS, and PECU Core Units have done a terrific job in helping the proposed MIP6 RWA application come in full fruition. At the same token, we believe this experience has showcase the numerous iterations needed in order to make the onboarding of RWA off-chain collaterals\u2013hopefully much easier to onboard. From instituting a DST structure, to hiring a calculation agent (Ankura), architecture of MIP21 Contacts: designing an RWAToken (ERC20 token placeholder), RWAJar (transfer any incur DAI profit to Surplus Buffer\u2013via an CES Keeper), maintaining a Participation Funding Account via the RWA MPTrust, and other innovative ideas/thinking and moving parts. All in all this has been a challenging onboarding experience that will hopefully showcase the talent that MakerDAO and HVB have built together as partners, while innovating for this new and exciting landscape.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - July 4, 2022 Voted YES to the proposed parameters changes by MOMC as we continue to see assets locked in credit protocols continue to slide. However, we agree with JP Morgan that things are starting to settle-down and, \u201cthe current deleveraging cycle may not be very protracted\u201d, as some of the price action for the majors are reminiscent of 2019. A time when cooler heads prevailed, and the next cycle was just around the corner.  Select a Target Level of rNPI Profitability to Guide Budget Cuts - July 4, 2022 Rank Choice: Break-even (Plus-minus 5%)  \u2013 one thing that we can All agree upon is that when going through a crisis, a business needs to figure out how to keep revenue coming in, control costs, and of course\u2013you gotta monitor the cash reserves. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have access to CU revenue KPIs, accurate end-user churn,  opportunities (some call them a sales pipeline), and the closing rate of new opportunities (closers close). When your back is against the wall you need to get out there and make things happen. Close deals. Bring in new revenue streams. And while you wait for closers to close, you need to use methodologies such as scenario planning. And you need to be patient, and if that means breaking even\u2013then you break even. The strategic planning question should be: what are the focal issues, external forces, and uncertainties that would lead this DAO to make cuts in Core Units and reduce the potential of Core Units to maximize closing deals? While we agree that a credit-crunch crisis is certainly here, the above deserves planning and analysis on how a potential surprise could disrupt the current strategic outlook of MakerDAO. Therefore while we wait for conditions to turn as we did during the last \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, and we move again to \u201cbreak-even\u201d. Patience is a moral virtue. ",

As we All know, this implementation needs further investigation as to if MIP21 can be used, or if the proposed structure can implemented as a \u201cmodified PSM implementation that incentivizes users to sell tokenized ETFs to MakerDAO in return for newly minted DAI.\u201d Hence, we believe Backed Finance could possibly offers MakerDAO a different perspective on the mission to bring RWAs on-chain and diversify from its dependence on solely speculative crypto tokens. We believe that it\u2019s only a matter of time before the entire DeFi ecosystem tokenizes RWAs including government treasuries, equities, corporate bonds, and yes, Real Estate. We also believe this beautiful tech can cut out the middleman that RWAs are plagued by. Therefore, we move forward and support the further investigation of Backed Finance and Vote Yes to this Greenlight Poll. ",

Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022 Voted Yes for the need to create performance indicators as MakerDAO is the leading Governance SHEPARD in the entire ecosystem. The DAO needs to innovate the greater good of decentralization. And if you don\u2019t think DAOs are being taken seriously\u2013then please visit France and see how some small Autonomous Regions are being built and even labelled as \u201cDAOs.\u201d This POLL allows a working group of folks who deeply care about responsible budgeting, and possibly having to navigate a recessionary environment, to come together and adjust the current budgets that have made a lot of MKR token owners unhappy. If they cannot reach consensus\u2013then such results from working group will not be implemented. And yes, Please understand that not every Core Unit Team budget is beyond Real World budgets, or that CU Team Member are getting paid a salary that goes beyond what web 2 employees get paid. But the Public Theory is that Core Unit team members and even Delegates are looting the Surplus Buffer. We need to manage that perception much better. If this DAO does NOT act on the concerns of those MKR token owners that are unhappy with the current budget allocations, then that means YOU the Delegate, or MKR active voter is not listening. This Poll does not constitute for Strategic Finance to make All the budgetary decisions. It is a workshop to come together and make it right for the benefit of MKR token owners and the future of the DAO. And there\u2019s no secret recipe for DAO budget allocations, or Key Performance Indicators. But we won\u2019t know until we all chimed-in and attempted to write history. Some in the community have rallied and provided their own views on how this can be accomplished. And that my friends is superb! Here are some suggestions 3F Delegate has made: Generate Key Performance Questions (KPQs) Before KPIs HOW do you generate KPQs before KPIs?

Does MakerDAO aspire to be an Investment Manager, or a decentralized lending protocol that issues over-collateralized loans? 3F Delegate advocates for the latter, and prefers that MakerDAO does NOT RUSH into being identified as an investment vehicle. However, such scenarios can play out via the Clustering of the MetaDAO structure, where certain vehicles can resemble and operate as Centralized Protector MetaDAOs. We urge the authors of this proposal to NOT RUSH Treasury Management on-behalf of MKR token owners when many questions are still unanswered.   The Question if Bridges will become subject to regulation is now an open-ended question. Will cross-chain bridges be identified as VASPs since World Regulators are now looking to combat crypto laundering? We don\u2019t know the answers without prior guidance and therefore choose not to support this proposal since it proposes to cross 2-Centralized bridges that are looking to decentralize, but are not there yet. Let\u2019s wait, why so much rush to experiment?   And last but not least, the Media is starting to paint this Ecosystem to the average Jane and Joe as a Clown Show. You want evidence:  The Crypto Geniuses Who Vaporized a Trillion Dollars. Everyone trusted the two guys at Three Arrows Capital. They knew what they were doing \u2014 right? Again, what\u2019s the rush\u2013Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Everything in due time.    Ratification Poll for Modify Dai Foundation Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP74) - August 8, 2022 1st Ranked Choice: BASE. \u2013 this is a continuation of the Approved budget by MKR token owners from the Inception of the DAI Foundation. The Base budget is lower, as the reserve is 270K DAI, versus the original proposal of 1M DAI annually. This is more than fair to a Foundation that understands the current state of MakerDAO and also receives NO MKR bonuses. And in some regions (like the U.S.) they are doing it with what some might consider under market compensation. With a lot of Risk involved. **3F Delegate urges All MKR Token owners and Delegates to support this Rank Choice to a group of people who care and will help protect the future of MakerDAO. 2nd Ranked Choice: Bear Choice \u2013 A nice gesture by the DAI Foundation. However, we barely agree that this is necessary as our First-Choice clearly states what is the best path forward. If this does become the \u201cRank-Choice\u201d of MKR token owners and Delegates, it will once again show the failure of this voting system.  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 Voted YES to a much needed proposal for the orderly off-boarding and unwinding of Core Units. Thank you to @twblack88 and the rest of the contributors for putting in long hours and hard work into this proposal.  Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 1st Ranked Choice: Approve proposed budget (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months) This is a well thought budget by the Oracles CU that allows for both a reduction in MakerDAO expenses, but also allows them to work on their mandate for the next 12 months w/out incurring further cuts\u2013because new \u201cmonkey-wrenches\u201d will be thrown at this ecosystem by both the fast-paced changing environment of crypto, and regulators who seem unable to provide proper guidance at the moment. It is important that this CU can keep functioning without MKR token owners nickel and dime their budget to death. Let\u2019s allow this CU to work and innovate without interruptions. 2nd Ranked Choice: Approve existing budget (Business as usual) As stated above\u2013this CU needs no interruptions.  Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 Voted YES to a necessary amendment that allows the expansion of the D3M to external protocols that allow users to deposit / withdraw DAI.  Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 Voted a big NOOO to this CU off-boarding, who\u2019s work ethic is bar-none and if we could compare such work ethic to one of the Greatest in showbiz, it would be the Godfather of Soul, James Brown. The Hardest Working Man In Show Business More importantly this Team is working diligently on how they can improve. They are out all over the ecosystem investigating, asking questions, and skill milling. I must also admit that at the last event at EthCC\u2013I met and spoke to more new and young faces attending DAIVinity than ever before, with a hunger to dig deeper into MakerDAO.

As we All know, such should include targeted growth volumes and revenues, resources quantities, costs and expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flow. Therefore, we believe the DAO needs to act in a way that shows intention to realize the plan. When we think about allocating budgets, the purpose should also include what resources are also necessary to help CUs achieve their intended targets. How will the DAO motivate CUs to strive to achieve budget goals and how will their performance be evaluated, and how can it provide visibility to the DAO\u2019s future performance. This Target Level Spend Poll intends to minimize Risk to the DAO. However, it is difficult to determine such, but 3F Delegate recognizes that this DAO needs financial controls and the current spend levels are undefined. Strong financial controls will help MKR token owners have an inside window view of the numbers being reported and the financial growth of the DAO that will help protect the organization\u2019s assets. We believe that strengthening financial controls will help the DAO monitor expenses more efficiently. Therefore, 3F Delegate chooses to initiate a lower Spend Level at 17 million DAI progressively lowering to 15.5 million DAI in order to establish for more solid financial management of the operations of MakerDAO.  Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR) - August 22, 2022 Voted YES in order to get CES to provide much needed Professional Services for collateral onboarding and management of RWA MIP6/67 applications that are pending. 3F believes this is a necessary step to redress the hole left by the dismantling of RWF-001. However, if @collateral-core-unit and @strat-fin-core-unit plan on working together and using the PFR to educate the MakerDAO community on the details of future RWA implementations they need to do a better job of communicating to the entire DAO. The communication throughout the dismantling of RWF-001 and how to pickup the pieces leaves the community with a lot to be desired in the near future on how to handle a similar scenario. Pencil it in as a \u201clearning lesson\u201d. Surely you can\u2019t expect Recognized Delegates and MKR token owners to be happy with how this all went down.

Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) - August 15, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 3F Delegate is a proponent of the Clean Money initiative and mining with equipment even when using renewable energy does not constitute a carbon neutrality approach. Therefore, 3F cannot support, or green-light this MIP6/67 RWA application. Furthermore, currently MakerDAO does not retain a Core Unit that specializes in Real World Assets and we believe this MIP6/67 application will only take-up resources from CU teams that are providing coverage.  Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 With the recent fallout of RWF-001 it will be difficult to assess a credit, legal, and technical opinion. We ask the DDC team to reconsider applying in the near future when MakerDAO has better visibility in the direction it is headed towards, and apologize for the untimely inconvenience. ",

Yes, lowering Stability Fees  will decrease the Protocol\u2019s revenue by approximately 2.8M DAI. But 3F Delegate believes the importance of shifting away  and lowering the protocol\u2019s reliance on the USDC PSM is vital for the future success of MakerDAO. Lowering the Stability Fees on ETH-A, ETH-B, and WSTETH-A will hopefully help MakerDAO stimulate Vault usage. ETH is the heartbeat of MakerDAO, and 3F Delegate as a proponent of the Endgame State believes that accumulating ETH and stakedETH is the best path forward.  Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) - August 29, 2022 Voted YES to this SPF that will introduce Legal Domain work/research for one of many possible future Cashlike RWAs collaterals of this type\u2013in this case; it is a Swiss-law tokenized short term bond ETFs held on-chain and proposed by Backed Finance. Originally reluctant to have the Strategic Finance CU lead the research of the Backed Finance proposal, but the current state of Real-World Finance will continue in our opinion to be non-existent until either MKR token owners choose the path forward with a New RWF Core Unit, or the Endgame State is chosen as the best path forward. Since the best path forward for RWAs is currently undetermined, 3F Delegate believes SFCU is the best available option to help MakerDAO understand RWA products that are starting to be tokenized by the likes of Blackrock, State Street, Ita\u00fa Unibanco from Brasil, and many others from across the Globe. However, there will be many different types of implementations for the tokenization of RWAs\u2013and it is extremely important that MakerDAO does not get left behind. As the original visionary of bringing RWAs on-chain and to the forefront of Blockchain Technology, it is important that MakerDAO explore and invest in the innovative future for the tokenization of RWAs. 3F Delegate moves to support this SPF request.

The current TVL of Uniswap v3 for the BUSD/DAI LP is $21.90K. On Arrakis Vaults the BUSD/DAI vault has a TVL of $536.74. Unfortunately this collateral type has failed to scale. More importantly, 3F Delegate struggles to see any how BUSD will gain any traction on the Ethereum Ecosystem, when the largest Stablecoin provider in the World, Tether\u2013struggles to gain acceptance versus USDC in this said ecosystem. So, how in the world will this Gelato LP token generate at least 30M DAI. We don\u2019t see it\u2013and choose to Poll, NO.  Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 It feels like 10-years have passed-by since the Ren Team promised to decentralized their virtual nodes (\u201cDarkNodes\u201d)  via progressive decentralization, yet here we are in 2022 and the core team still maintains control of its nodes. In fact, the roadmap I used to personally follow returns a 404 error. Indeed\u2013perhaps some things have changed since I last followed the project closely as I once did, but the lack of product traction and lack of network effects is still evident. Even then, ignoring my rant\u2013the proposed Uni-v3 LP token does not possess the attributes and qualities required to become a successful MakerDAO Collateral Type.  This is evident by the onboarding of the RENBTC-A Vault which is currently producing 0.04% of the outstanding DAI. This vault has not led to either an increase in Revenue and DAI growth. With TVL of $10.17M on UNI-v3 \u2013 3F Delegates believes Daily Volume and TVL needs to at least 10x in order to be consider as a MakerDAO collateral type. Unfortunately at this time and point, there\u2019s just too much liquidity risk, demand risk, and some will argue that there is regulatory risk. With the former being clearly evident, and not enough proof that this collateral type will Generate at least 30M DAI annually, we choose to Poll for NO.  Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 Voted YES as this is the only MIP6 application that has the potential to generate 30M DAI over the next 12-months and it needs to be further investigated by the MakerDAO teams via the Greenlight Collateral Index. Gnosis has a vast Treasury ($300M++) ranging from ETH to COMP. It is also proposing to rebrand its marquee product, xDAI to DAI. This is something that MakerDAO needs to investigate further. The last pass this community made was not acquiring the xDAI Chain, and allowing it to ride off into the sunset with someone else. Let\u2019s not take another pass on an opportunity that can possibly lead to network effects via xDAI. We choose to vote YES and hope other MKR token owners and Delegates will Greenlight this MIP6 application. ",

Per SFCU the tout increase from 0 to 20 bips should mitigate arb opportunities by bots, but I suspect this will need to be revisited and perhaps increase a bit higher to discourage such.  End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 This is a tough one here. As someone who was inspired by the community, learned from the community, and who aspired early on to be apart of the community, without the need for, or existence of SourceCred, it does feel like this powerful tool has run its course. However, I do remember the days when SourceCred was introduced and it made me realized that governance mining incentivizes were possible. And such tooling allowed community participants to build a reputation (\u201cCred + Grain\u201d) that I believed could be used as an DID (Decentralized Identity). So, it breaks my heart to see SourceCred get abused. The plethora of Forum accounts that are created  for abusive purposes is just overwhelming. They don\u2019t add value, and some are keen to \u201cgame\u201d SourceCred. But then I think of the forward visionaries. The Ceramic\u2019s of this ecosystem, the Disco Data Dating credential DID builders, the Gitcoin Passport identifiers, and so many more that I have probably never heard of\u2013and I realize that quitting on SourceCred is an easy way out. It\u2019s done, it had its heyday in the limelight\u2013so, let\u2019s quit. But we are not quitters. We are innovators. And with innovation comes great visions. But, so was America Online. And it breaks my heart to admit that SourceCred is the AOL of Governance Mining. Therefore, we sadly move to vote YES to ending SourceCred.  MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 Voted YES as season\u2019s change, yields change and AAVE\u2019s ETH supply rates for sure change and it makes it difficult for the D3M to stay competitive with the current parameters (Proposed Nov. 2021). Therefore, it makes sense to remove the ETH supply yield and liquidity incentives from calculations when MOMC needs to recommend the Target Borrow Rate (bar). In the current environment, the old calculations are as old as aunt Mabel.  MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 Assuming the first Poll is successful: Option 1:  0.5% Spread, bar at 2% with 90M DC and the possibility of 680M DAI in revenue per annum assuming current forward market rates. Option 2:  0% Spread, 'bar\" at 1.5% with 105M DC and the possibility of 730M DAI in revenue oer annum assuming current forward market rates. As the protocol looks to restart the D3M these are good mid-market data points to help the MOMC gauge the spread between the D3M target borrow rate parameters and the ETH-A stability fee. ",

While the Protocol Owned Vault Emissions, MIP84 will advocate for decentralized DAI backed by stkETH/ETH the ethos of true decentralization, as the pace of change in this ecosystem will be hypersonic, not glacial. The Endgame proposal stand to abolish bureaucracy for what it is; an unconscionable and unnecessary tax on human initiatives and imagination.

Thank you for using your imagination and getting the ecosystem excited. The swag you delivered to the people will live forever. Unfortunately the inflationary environment has led to cuts in expenditures. However, we hope to see this initiative reincarnated soon\u2122 perhaps via the clustering of a creator DAO, or as an ecosystem actor.  Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 Another heartbreaking vote with a YES to the off-boarding of the Events CU. This team has done a terrific job in branding \u201cDAIVinity\u201d\u2013it has become a DeFi word that I have overheard people use during internal conversations. But more importantly this team took their work seriously and slept and dreamt all things MakerDAO. They displayed the definition of a true MakerDAO community member, with love that was showcased at every event that they delivered. You will be missed John & Jon.

Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 Voted YES to a community supported initiative to put an end to a Core Unit that disappointed 3F when delivering the expectations that we had in early 2021. However, while delivering results were below par, this is a lesson learned for the DAO\u2013yes, a costly one\u2013but one that MKR token owners should never forget. I will say that perhaps some good will come out it, as we have gain a couple of individuals that we believe can produce positive results to the Endgame Plan. Onwards and upwards!  Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 Voted YES to MIP81 custodial services by Coinbase rewards, a new program that helps in the desperate need to diversify the USDC PSM exposure\u2013but more importantly\u2013no organization in their right mind would sit on Billions of dollars without putting that said money to work. This MIP can also lead to an innovative custodial smart contract controlled by MakerDAO governance, that will be explored and perhaps created by CES/PE, with the help of the folks at CB. This is a new paradigm, and yes it is uncomfortable\u2013but the construct and propensity of Trust Structures, and the antiquity of Institutional Custodial Services, along with the possibility of a self-custody SC, provides confidence for 3F Delegate to support MIP81. Risk is real, fear is a choice.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 Voted YES to a proposal that includes providing 500M USDC to Coinbase for ETH & WBTC collaterals, along with similar legal and technical structures to MIP65. This is an exciting proposal that finally allows Monetalis to showcase their talent. Since early-on, 3F Delegate has recognized the talents of the Monetalis team, as they are eager to help this DAO scale beyond and above. We hope this along with MIP65 proves our intuitions, right. And when thinking in bets, we are willing to bet that Monetalis will deliver. Onwards and upwards!  Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 With the release of the Spring Cluster proposal, 3F Votes YES to the \u201cGreen-lighting\u201d of this Poll for the needed legal and commercial risk domain work SPF. BlockTower being a community member will bring new exciting RWA ideas to the forefront of this DAO, and we are excited to see how this arranger model can prosper alongside Centrifuge, via the Endgame Plan.  Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 Voted NO as the Endgame Plan will leave a couple of CUs if any in the near future. This MIP41 adjustment also leaves a lot to be desired, because there\u2019s a need to ratified the off-boarding of a facilitator depending on the type of Core Unit\u2013not all CUs are created equally. More meat-on-the-bone could have helped get a\"yes\" vote from 3F, however we are confident the Endgame solves a lot of the meat-on-the-bone this proposal needed. There is the open question and possibility that a Facilitator can become a grifter, and perform zero-work while being compensated by the DAO. Adjustments to stop grifters is preferable.  Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 Voted YES to the off-boarding of the RWF-001 Facilitator, as MakerDAO closes this chapter and clusters into the Endgame plan, which will thrive through meritocracy, experimentation, market economies, unselfishness, and good meta.

We believe the Immunefi CU is best suited in the MetaDAO Economy as an Ecosystem Actor that will compete against other Ecosystem Actors to provide services. We look forward to seeing more contributions from community member Josh Pritkin via the Endgame Plan.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 Over the next 12-months the DUX CU will play an important role in the pregame stage of the Endgame and will be a premier catalyst in building and designing the game-changing front-ends. We believe the amount of workload this team will incur needs to be budgeted at the highest level. Therefore, we urge All MKR token owners to support this super-talented team by keeping them at, \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d EDIT:  1st RANKED-CHOICEPreference for a NewBase Budget at 1,611,420 DAI as primary choice. It allows for a less expensive expansion of DUX, while saving 200K, and allowing DUX to deliver\u2013versus \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d budget request. 2nd RANKED-CHOICE:  Approve existing budget only (Business as usual): 1,871,300 DAI  Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 Voted NO as there\u2019s no need to onboard another provider of Treasury Management and the current opaque market environment does not play favorably for centralized actors that have exposure to crypto related assets. Also, MakerDAO should not take on further counterparty risk with an entity that carries a balance sheet with Total Assets of $1.9B and Total Liabilities of ($1.6B). Therefore, we cannot support this proposal and ask CoinShares to consider revisiting the protector MetaDAOs structures as a possible means to work with this DAO.  Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 Origin protocol has tremendous ambition to create global Network Effects with OUSD and has shown continuous resilience when needing to survive bear markets. However, we believe the timing is not right as the Endgame Scopes (TBD) will more than likely not require the need to add rewards of a Governance Token like OGN. Perhaps one day if the Endgame Scopes requires adding this type of asset class via a Creator MetaDAO, or as an ecosystem actor\u2013Origin Protocol can then provide value-added services to the Endgame Plan. Otherwise, we want to say thank you to the Origin team for this proposal and ask that they stay resilient. Onward and upward!  Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 Voted NO as the Endgame Plan calls for Ecosystem Actors to provide services to both Clusters, and to future MetaDAOs. We believe the Immunefi CU is best suited in the MetaDAO Ecosystem as an Ecosystem Actor that will compete against other Ecosystem Actors to provide services.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 Voted: REJECT BUDGET as the Endgame Plan calls for Ecosystem Actors to provide services to both Clusters and MetaDAOs. We believe the Immunefi CU is well suited in the MetaDAO Ecosystem as an Ecosystem Actor that will compete against other Ecosystem Actors to provide services.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 Voted REJECT BUDGET as the Endgame Plan calls for Ecosystem Actors to provide services to both Clusters and  MetaDAOs. We believe COM-001 is well suited in the MetaDAO Economy as an Ecosystem Actor that will provide Governance Communication services to DVCs, incubating Clusters, MetaDAOs, and perhaps even Councils, Tribunals, and Delegates can hire this team for comm services. COM-001 can also use project-based funding for the benefit of educating the community on what exactly is the Endgame Plan (desperately needed). While we believe COM-001 has provided a valuable service as a Core Unit, COM-001 is best suited as an ecosystem actor in the MetaDAO Ecosystem.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 Voted REJECT BUDGET as the Endgame Plan during the pregame calls for less Core Units and instead for more Ecosystem Actors that can provide services to both Clusters and MetaDAOs. We are under the believe that SAS-001 is best suited in the MetaDAO Economy as an Ecosystem Actor that will also compete against other service providers. This will allow the MetaDAO ecosystem to encourage competition\u2013although we expect SAS-001 to be 10-steps ahead of other competitors.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 Voted APPROVED BUDGET although this Core Unit should be moving to the Endgame as an ecosystem actor and eventually competing with other service providers. However, this CU will need to support many MakerDAO environments during the transition to the Endgame. If you cut out their budget you will leave some of the Core CUs scrambling to put-out fires, as opposed to focusing on the pregame. There are also many DAO assets that are dependent of TechOps. We look forward to seeing the Endgame decentralize any central points of control that TechOps is currently controlling.  Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 Voted NO as we believe there is an urgency to accumulate decentralized collateral and the POVE is designed to help MakerDAO accumulate a collateral that is permissionless, decentralized, and trustless via the Endgame Plan. As ETH fulfills this requirement, we are excited to see the launch of the POVE and believe the MIP 84 proposed upper limit is a good starting point.  Therefore, we vote to reject this ratification of MIP84.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 Voted YES to what will be known as  the Viridian Cluster and proposer of MIP88 for the on-boarding of a DAI 225M RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM. More importantly\u2013we believe there\u2019s a need to diversify the USDC that has accumulated in the PSM and the Viridian cluster is proposing to acquire super senior AAA rated RMBS via a similar legal structure of the Monetalis Clydesdale (MIP65). We also believe that this initiative can incur a changing Scope and the ask for 225M DAI will not be entirely used for RMBS opportunities. Instead this team will patiently roll-out the Viridian Cluster, while assessing the economic environment and eventually providing the right strategy on behalf of MakerDAO while managing the Vault diligently.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 Voted YES \u2013 similar to MIP65, this proposal will look to acquire ETF products via the same structure and technical setup (MIP21). But more importantly the Author of MIP89 has proposed the Viridian Cluster and MIP65, MIP88, and MIP89 play well in the sandbox, as they will implement their strategic vision that can solidify this cluster as a possible Protector MetaDAO. We believe MIP88 and MIP89 will both adapt to the changing economic environment. But more importantly Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) will kick-start the Clean Money vision that the 3F Delegate platform has been waiting to support.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 RANK CHOICE: Approve speedy operations platform option budget: 3,199,200 DAI streamed over twelve months. Reason:  This Core Unit understands that their sole purpose is now to support the launch of the Endgame Plan and eventually the CU will eventually need to wind-down. However, in order to get the pregame rolling, they need to have the support of MKR token owners and should be allocated a sufficient budget that will allow them to work relentlessly in order to perform efficient sprints, and more importantly\u2013deliver pregame results. We also believe that this CU can internally implement project-based budgeting for pending, or future pregame deliverables. We also believe that this CU understands the current economic environment and will do its best to spend wisely. ",

With the pending Endgame looking to move ahead vigorously, on-boarding a collateral type with a 2.5% SF, and a DC of 5M DAI is too much of a distraction for barely any reward. Also, when this application was submitted\u2013GNO traded at 180DAI\u2013today at 84DAI. Liquidity is also non-existent.

BT will take on a TIN ratio of 30% (junior tranche) and will use its internal  investment committee for the approval of investments, as well as internal and external due diligence. We believe that with a DC of 150M and the showcasing of Tinlake\u2013while keeping the DROP tokens on-chain is a win-win for any future Protector MetaDAO.  This ecosystem is desperate for innovating with RWAs on-chain, as opposed to being off-chain. We believe this is the perfect combination that takes DeFi to the next level.  Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A - November 21, 2022 Voted YES as this off-boarding is the right move for an asset that has exposure to the Alameda Research collapse. Fully support to off-board ASAP.  Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) - November 21, 2022 Voted YES as we fully support both Strategic Finance to continue to drive the onboarding of RWAs until the Protector MetaDAOs are set in stone, and we believe BlockTower with MIP90 offers a terrific opportunity for the DAO to diversify its USDC exposure with AAA  rated structured credit and money market funds.

It is also evident that some CUs will be moving away from using TechOps and will be looking for other Ecosystem Actors that can provide customer services that meet expectations. While some CUs are dependent of TechOps and we recognize that not approving the current budget can lead to distractions in the roll-out phase of the Pregame, there\u2019s no reason why TechOps can\u2019t comeback with a LOWER Budget request in the next two (2) months and make the proper adjustments necessary to service those Core Units that seem adamant about retaining the services of TechOps. We also don\u2019t want to shy away from our previous reasoning. We had asked that we avoid putting Core Units under pressure to make adjustments in a world with a low TechOps budget. However, we have come to the final conclusion that TechOps can adjust their Budget accordingly and for Core Units to make the proper adjustments for the benefit of MakerDAO. Furthermore, if we support this Budget we are sending out a message that other CUs should not adjust their budgets accordingly to both the Endgame Plan and the current Bear Market. We ask @simonkp and the TechOps team to reassess the Budget Request and adjust to the current Bear Market Environment and how Core Units will be using their services going forward (some have said they will no longer need the services of TechOps). As @simonkp already understands, the Endgame Plan calls for this CU to phase-out into an Ecosystem Actor. Therefore, it is important the the proper adjustments be made now rather than later. ",

                    "content": "Hello @simonkp Thank you for asking for this constructive feedback, and I really appreciate you publicly reaching out and asking 3F Delegate for feedback.  While having a Core Unit budget rejected is no easy thing to accept\u2014we want you to know that it was a tough decision to vote No to the TechOps Budget request\u2014and ask that your team members come back stronger, diligently, and involved more than ever. 3F Delegate believes that the DAO was evenly split between the satisfaction and dissatisfaction with TechOps performance, the services rendered, the steep budget ask during this bear market, and the Endgame pivot\u2014which we believe will eliminate over 80% of Core Units over the next 6 months. With regards to CUs and Recognized Delegates that have expressed their discontent w/TechOps to 3F Delegate either discreetly in person, or discreetly via the Metaverse\u2014I don\u2019t have a word for word recollection of how it was verbally expressed, but I will try my best to explain it. Again, their discontent was provided discreetly and 3F Delegate will respect their discretionary disclosures.  Unsatisfactory Performance With that understanding\u2014some CUs quickly come to mind as being discreet about their displeasure with both the monetary charges incurred/quoted, offering of services at excessive price rates, and the expected customer services that allegedly were not delivered by TechOps:   A certain CU felt offended by the TechOps offer to charge money for services related to a certain MakerDAO asset that TechOps controls and was previously owned by the Foundation. Again, I don\u2019t have a word for word verbal recollection\u2014but hearing this gives the impression that TechOps has a strong-hold and position on the DAO based on the numerous assets TechOps allegedly controls. While we understand business is business\u2014I can also tell you that once some of the Recognized Delegates got a whim of this\u2014they were unhappy\u2014particularly because some do not welcome what we call \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d as a business practice.   Vocal discontent by certain team members of a CU that TechOps has at times failed to deliver on the services rendered (and at a steep price), which became an immediate displeasure to some Delegates. Stories of such CU having to take action in the middle of the night, while your team was unaware of the need to take action related to services that TechOps should render diligently, and is paid for (again, unsatisfactory to some delegates).   Furthermore, Delegates have been communicated by such CU that in-the-near future TechOps services will no longer be needed\u2014such CU intends to run such services internally. While this might have not been communicated to TechOps during the budget RFC period\u2014some Delegates believe that:   A. The Endgame Plan calls for TechOps to become an Ecosystem Actor.   B. There is no need for TechOps to budget for certain services since the Endgame has been accepted by MKR token owners and it is best for TechOps to reapply with a lower budget.   Other Opinions by some of the Recognized Delegates:   3F Delegate is under the impression that some recognized delegates believe TechOps is no longer needed. Each CU that will remain with the Core (ex., PECU, Risk, Growth) can run their own nodes(PE as an example), GovAlpha/Future Governance MetaDAOs should hire you as an Ecosystem Actor, or step-up and run Discord/Forums on their own,   other CUs like DUX need to also step-up and take care of basic web-2 duties that they believe you are delivering and charging DUX for. While other Delegates believe TechOps is necessary, but have a preference for a much lower budget and Core Units to become self-sufficient.   Perhaps some Delegates might not understand the complexity of the services TechOps offers \u2014 however, we believe it is the responsibility of TechOps to communicate such complex services to the greater community.   Disclosure: a major Recognized Delegate was also 10-minutes away from changing their Vote to NO before expiry of the Budget Poll (they were unable to pull the trigger\u2014with ample time they would have).    Satisfactory Performance   A certain CU is super dependent of your services and more than satisfied. They were vocal in defending the need for TechOps\u2014however, they did not want to comment on your budget ask \u2014 although such opinion was not asked for\u2026   Another CU who is also super dependent of your services\u2014believe that in the upcoming pivot to the Endgame\u2014TechOps will be pivotal in helping deploy certain end-user services\u2014particularly during the Pregame. However, they were also not eager to comment on your budget request, even though they were not ask for such commentary. All-in-all, we got the idea your services are highly appreciated by certain CUs but the HIGH budget ask is something that both MKR token owners  and even outsiders should question.   Another CU welcomes and appreciates your services\u2014however, certain delegates have express their displeasure of such CU not taking on simple tasks like running and taking full ownership of certain applications, and when the Facilitators of such CU were pressed\u2014they acknowledge that they are able, willing, and ready. Hence, this further sold some Delegates on the idea that TechOps is not needed\u2014because CUs can step-up and \u201cself-custody\u201d certain DAO assets.   Other CUs were neutral \u2014 some Facilitators that are more technical of these neutral CUs might have expressed that some of the services you offer can easily be duplicated. But I might be forgetting detailed, good, and constructive criticism\u2014so please forgive me, I have provided what I can recall.    Final Thoughts All-in-all I can tell you that one thing you could do better is to communicate better with the Community on what you are delivering, why you are charging DAI for such services, and why the services of TechOps are important and valued at the budget ask that you submitted. One thing I learned about communities is that you must be involved\u2014in order for the community to understand\u2014why you are necessary and more importantly, why you are needed. I hope that helps Simon. 3F Delegate believes that TechOps is valuable. But in what capacity\u2014remains a question mark since we believe you\u2019ll need to cluster  as an Ecosystem Actor. We believe this pivot will allow TechOps  to blossom without the bureaucracy that it is currently under. I also totally understand how this must be frustrating. But we know that you are resilient and believe TechOps is a big part of this DAO. We ask that TechOps keeps pushing forward. Again, thanks for allowing 3F to comment. If you have any questions, or concerns please email 3F Delegate via the forum in order to avoid spamming this thread. All the best, Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC ",

More accumulation of decentralized collateral via stakedETH/ETH via the introduction of the POVE and ETHDAI. 3F Delegate believes that any excess surplus should be focused on the accumulation of  more decentralized collateral, preferably ETH/StakedETH\u2013versus short-term thinking in a very opaque market environment.  While cranking-up the DSR for the benefit of DAI holders is important, the current Crypto Winter can last many years (with an \u201cs\u201d) and this community should be thinking about how to survive and push-forward on building-out the Endgame Plan ecosystem. B. The DSR should be automated(this will take time away from other important work related to the Endgame Pivot), it should be analyzed, the risk parameters should be fine-tuned, and the protocol should become profitable before offering a DSR that will be taken seriously by large DAI holders and future large users. Unfortunately, increasing the DSR to even 1% will not create any mass usage of DAI, as the FTX debacle will linger in the minds of people for many years to come. We move to support a 50 basis points DSR increase as a case-study for having a conversation on how  to properly build this product as a future lever for the Endgame Plan.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 Supporting here increasing the wStakedETH line\u2013as mentioned before\u2013we are proponents of increasing ETH-based collateral in the system\u2013and we support lowering the line for wBTC\u2013long overdue.  Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 Voted YES as we have waited for a log-time for the introduction of the Trust Indenture as an RWA legal structure that should benefit MakerDAO token-holders . 3F supports an assessment for this structure that should represent the best interests of MKR token owners, and also assess and define the role of the indenture trustee\u2013who will be pivotal in making sure New Silver complies with the terms of the trust indenture. While we are excited about putting the long-awaited Trust Indenture into play\u2013we are also supporters of increasing the DC of the New Silver Vault to 50M\u2013as we believe this borrower has cautiously navigated Vault utility, paying SFs, they understand the importance of having a Junior Tranche (TIN/DROP Token, 20/80), and also providing MakerDAO a fair Stability Fee of 4.5%. All-in-all, many in the community have been satisfied and surprised how well New Silver has played in the RWA sandbox. We move to support and vote Yes. ",

He is motivated by the true passion of being a MakerDAO community member and going beyond and above his duty to make sure the DAI and Maker brand are recognized across Latin America. We desperately need more humans like Sebix, who are motivated by the mission, and not by the money.  Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 This was a tough choice as both candidates are super talented and posses the skills that are beneficially important in the services of the Dai Foundation, which are to provide a safe haven and protect Maker IP, including the DAI and MakerDAO trademarks. We voted in the following order for the two (2) individuals who have the right stuff to be board members of the DAI Foundation. 1st Choice: Daimon-Law, who possess both technological knowledge and the ability to interpret law from the depths of Australia to the United Kingdom. He brings over 25 years of experience and seems to have a high interest in helping with the development and progress of Web3. We are supporters in  the success of Web3, therefore we see Daimon-Law as asset to the DAI Foundation. 2nd Choice: 0xbocaJ is a community member who has been active in Maker Governance recently, and has done good work for the nonprofit community, and is now deeply involved in the success of Web3. His background suggest that he will serve the DAI Foundation accordingly, and we see no reason why MKR token owners and Recognized Delegates shouldn\u2019t choose 0xbocaJ as their 1st Choice. Again, tough choice\u2013and as they say, \u201cin order to be a winner there must be a loser\u201d; but here we see two winners that will be beneficial to the DAI Foundation.  Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 Voted YES in support of the operations of SAS-001 throughout Q1 of 2023. This Core Unit understands that they need to prepare for the pivot to the Endgame and is taking the right steps to modify its budget, as well as recognizing that they will need to evolve as an ecosystem actor.  Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 Voted YES to this request to dissolve COM-001, a team that has done terrific work over the years and now needs to adapt to the Endgame ecosystem.  Ratification Poll for Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication (MIP55c3-SP11) - December 12, 2022 Voted NO \u2013 while some might agree that behavioral economics can tell us that emotions can affect individual behavior and decision-making, and Twitter Feeds can arguably read sentiment and mood states\u2013we believe the author of this proposal lacks the fundamental skills of using a basic application, like Twitter. We had a real-life Twitter experience with the Author of this proposal. On September 7, 2022 El Progreso and PVL were scheduled to do a Twitter Spaces with Ambire Wallet. A Twitter Spaces that Corina of the Growth Core Unit had organized. PVL could not figure out how to use Twitter Spaces and left El Progreso stranded in a live Twitter Spaces while the Ambire Co-Founder and the Host tried to unsuccessfully help him figure out how to use a simple application.  image1118\u00d71340 118 KB  While we recognized that using Twitter should not be the sole reason for not supporting this request, we also believe PVL has not fully committed to MakerDAO. His attempt at expressing his interest in being a MakerDAO delegate were twice interrupted by technological failures during the \u201cMeet your Delegate\u201d recordings. And while we recognize that technology falters, we believe PVL wants to win, but does not have the willingness to prepare to win. When representing MakerDAO, one should always make the proper preparations in order to succeed. This lack of unpreparedness convinces us that this MIP55 should not be approved. ",

Well deserved and hopeful that this will inspire the current team members to push forward.  Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023 We believe the development of the DssKiln will provide a lot of new opportunities for the DAO and a trial deployment makes sense. However, we do believe taking MKR out of the Market creates more illiquidity and we have a preference for more utility of MKR as a governance tool for the betterment of decentralization. Therefore we are taking a conservative approach on the quantitative structure of this trial. Here is how we Polled: First Ranked Choice: Burn 0.5 million DAI worth of MKR Second Ranked Choice: Burn 1 million DAI worth of MKR Third Ranked Choice: Burn 2 million DAI worth of MKR  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - January 9, 2023 Voted Yes in agreement with the OMC recommendations to reactivate the AAVEv2 D3M and increase the line for the Compound v2 D3M.

We like this idea for any excess DAI being returned to the surplus buffer.   Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 Voted an absolutely YES in order to kickstart the idea of funding a \u201cdefense fund\u201d that will attempt to protect MakerDAO core team members. One thing that we believe, is that everyone has the right to due process and should have the ability to be represented by the best representation available. Furthermore, we believe this proposed program can be expanded to a project like Nexus, or MKR token owners can opt to explore the reinsurance markets. We also understand that amount requested (5M DAI) will always be controlled by MakerDAO Governance, and this \u201cdefense fund\u201d can be used as the first tranche for the protection of Maker\u2019s Core Unit team members. We believe that in order for an MKR token owner to not believe this fund is desperately needed, they\u2019re more than likely not fully digesting the proposal and the desperate need for MakerDAO core contributors to be protected. We believe that the author and the team behind this proposal spent countless hours and did a lot of research for different options that MakerDAO could have explored. Therefore, we are confident after meeting the author at many conferences that they were dedicated in researching as well as asking the right questions to many legal experts in order to generate this proposal. Thank you to @layerzero and team for their hardwork and dedication. We move to support this desperately needed proposal.  Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 there\u2019s a need to outsource certain decentralized opportunities, as this protocol is currently inundated with centralized counterpart party proposals. If this proposal is rejected and MKR token owners believes that the Core of MakerDAO will deploy the same strategies as quickly as the Yearn Finance team, we have Igloos in Guadalajara, Mexico to sell you. As we all know, deploying anything via Maker Governance is an extremely excruciating process. If we believe that these decentralized strategies can be timed perfectly when DeFi yields comeback and are favorable, odds are MakerDAO will miss-the-boat. Because by the time Maker Governance decides to internally deploy such, it will be too late to get involved. MakerDAO Governance is slow as a snail.  On the other hand, we are not enjoying the proposed structure fee of 20%. We ask the author @corn and the Yearn team to reconsidered the proposed fee of 20%, and aligning it to a more feasible structure that MKR token owners will unanimously approve.  Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES as we believe the MakerDAO community has been desperately asking for an on-chain RWA monitoring solution since EthDenver 2022. Since, then as things move slowly in MakerDAO\u2013there has been not much of an effort, outside of some nice Dune dashboards by folks like Seb and others. We move to support.  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES for the addition of Chainlink Automation contract to the Maker Keeper network. This can be a nice addition to the Endgame, once Creator subDAOs get rolling.  Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES in support of the Viridian Cluster request for funding for the addition of team members, such as a PM, Compliance/legal lead, and a credit/risk lead. This funding is also needed in order to get MIP88 across the finish line and for the expansion of MIP65. You can\u2019t have a quality Endgame Cluster if funding is not available. As Endgame supporters, we move to support the Viridian Cluster.  Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 we had the privilege of meeting via Zoom with the proposed structure-finance consultant @roo and can\u2019t say enough about how impressed we were. This is a Gem of a discovery and many Thanks to Strategic Finance for this addition. And it\u2019s not just Flip Flop Flap Delegate that believes this, we have spoken with many that feel the same. We move to support.  Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (MIP14c2-SP2) - January 9, 2023 We totally support and Vote YES to expanding IS-001 to May 2023 as the pregame of the Endgame might not have further traction in midyear.  Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 Absolutely YES \u2013 we believe TechOps has improved its communication to the community, as well as understanding how to budget during this \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d There was never any doubt that this team will always be needed, and we are thankful that they have taken both the criticisms and advice from the community as an inspiration to deliver quality to MakerDAO. We move to support.  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Off-boarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 This proposal got off to a rocky start as it was confusing and the fact MakerDAO does not have a guide for providing a severance package to outgoing contributors made it that much more difficult to satisfy both GovComms and some community members. While some MKR owners and community members will probably not agree that any of the requested \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d options are deserved by this Core Unit, we did a lot of soul searching and realized that the facilitator @Davidutro, Artem and the rest of the part-time contributors have dedicated themselves to the Maker community. Specifically David U who we believe should have received MKR from the inception of his Core Unit and decided delay such in order to prove his good intentions. We have seen David U participate in this community since his Foundation days, and blossom into a dedicated MakerDAO community member. Therefore, we believe that he deserves the following options: (Rank-choice Poll)1ST CHOICE: Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 100% Multiplier for retroactive MKR - additional 107,317.50 DAI (CU-preferred) (Rank-choice)2ND CHOICE: Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 80% Multiplier for retroactive MKR - additional 85,854 DAI And last but not least, we hope David, Artem, and the rest of the contributors will continue to help this DAO move onward and upward in its quest to deploy the Endgame Constitution.  Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 with the delay of the Endgame rollout to the \u201cmid-game\u201d in 2023 it is important that this DAI Transfer Ceiling be removed in order to support the upcoming request for SPFs by Ecosystem Actors that will be needed accordingly. It\u2019s time to get rid of the Cap and support this Ratification.  Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 Voted YES for the deprecation of these MIPs that no longer serve a purpose.  Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 Voted NO \u2013 MIP 14 fills the void when SPFs(MIP55) and MIP40 (Budget sub-proposal) can\u2019t be used. This proposal had good intentions, but because of the Endgame and the possibility that the rollout will be delayed, it will hamper the ability for Ecosystem Actors to continue to support the DAO.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 Voted NO \u2013 MIP51c4 is a calendar exception for the Monthly Governance Cycle in December. Flip Flop Flap Delegate is an LLC made in America and we respect the observance of cultural and religious holidays, as well as protecting the mental health of our Core Unit Team members. Therefore, we ask for a better written proposal that defines emergency parameters more clearly. We also believe team members are aware that an emergency is possible during the December Governance cycle.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 1ST and only Choice: Approve both Voted for Approved Both - Flip Flop Flap Delegate is a dedicated MakerDAO Delegate Platform that believes in the attempt to Abstain on rare occasions, and we believe that Communication should be done at the same time as your platform submits the on-chain Vote. Rarely do we Communicate in less than 15-minutes of submitting the on-chain Vote. We highly recommend that everyone works in this capacity, vote & communicate simultaneously. ",

The community has been provided GUSD attestations. But as we all know, there is a difference between Attestations, Assurance, and Auditing. The latter is performed to discover data, risks, or compliance issues. Being that Gemini is not a Publicly Traded Company and is not required to publish 3rd party audits\u2013gauging the health factor of Gemini without audits performed by an independent public accountant during this difficult economic environment is an opaque task. And when risk factors are opaque, it is difficult for MKR token owners to Govern the Protocol diligently. Furthermore, we would have appreciated an analysis on how MakerDAO can redeem GUSD in case of insolvency. We are left with many unanswered questions and therefore, we move to Poll in the following ranking order: 1st Rank Choice: Decrease to 0 DAI. 2nd Rank Choice: Decrease to 100 million DAI.  Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) - January 16, 2023 Voted YES to reducing the PSM-GUSD-A Fee Tout to zero, as this will help ecosystem actors avoid the fees associated with removing GUSD from the PSM.

The introduction of the PSMs has proven to be the most efficient when it come to the utility of fiat stablecoins.  Adjust the Debt Floor (dust) - January 23, 2023 Rank Choice 1: LIMITED REDUCTION We believe that MakerDAO Vault Types are not a B2C product and should mostly be used by 3rd parties who wish to engage with such. However, we are willing to support reducing the dust parameters recommended by this proposal as a test-trial and gauge if the utility of these proposed MakerDAO Vaults increases over the next 6-months. With the recent downturn by crypto related products and the plethora of failed centralized parties, and the inefficiencies that the overall crypto end-user experience currently has as an Asset Class, we believe this reduction will not create more Vault utility. However, we want to be proven wrong. Rank Choice 2:  NO CHANGE As stated above, we don\u2019t believe Jane and Joe are coming back anytime soon\u2122 and the recent rise of ETH Gas prices will be a high-hurdle that the average Jane and Joe will never attempt to clear. This Vote alone had a cost of 387.920481565 Gwei (19DAI and 25 Conti). Hence, we are taking the other side of this trade that lowering the dust parameter will be an academic procedure that won\u2019t have any positive effects and dust parameters will have to revert. ",

We still believe that both:  The possibility of Layer 1 returning to high ETH Gas prices and Dust parameters remaining not attractive to end-users, will impede the growth of DAI supply. You couple that with the lack of DAO strategic initiatives to help end-users return to using DAI as a utility in DeFi, and the outlook is a tough road ahead.  Hopeful to see innovative initiatives like the recently proposed Spark Lend revive that missing vigor for DAI utility. ",

Large MKR holders can potentially manipulate the system, which limits community growth. To address this issue, the introduction of the Endgame offers unique surplus distribution methods to attract new MKR owners. Several ideas have been proposed to increase liquidity for MKR, and we believe that a new Surplus mechanism can benefit both new and existing token holders.  Active Polls 4 POLLS - ENDING FEB 27 2023 16:00 UTC  Ratification Poll - Declaration of Intent - Implement a Feature to Refund People who Lost Money Sending Dai to the Dai Contract Address (MIP13c3-SP14) - February 13, 2023 Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Voted NO - We believe that implementing this feature via the DssCure module would require engineering work to develop a merkle tree distribution contract, and such resources should be used to tackle other pending work. Additionally, the contract would need to be audited and the social contract of DAI redemption needs to be agreed upon by MKR token owners (including fees, ETH gas costs, minimum redemption, etc.). This would consume significant resources that could otherwise be used to develop MakerDAO\u2019s proposed products, such as ETHDAI (long overdue). However, we recognize the need for an improved end-user experience for interacting with DAI and suggest discussing the possibility of removing the End module, which some consider an obstacle.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP62 to Allow for Changing Communication Responsibilities (MIP4c2-SP33) - February 13, 2023 Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Voted YES \u2013 we are hopeful that adding this responsibility to GovAlpha-Core-Unit via component MIP62c5 will lead to great communication coordination and that GovAlpha will onboard someone who is more than qualified without the Vote of MKR token owners. This leads to less bureaucracy, so GovAlpha needs to step up and prove that they can get the job done right.  Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process (MIP4c2-SP30) - February 13, 2023 Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Voted YES \u2013 As proponents of cutting out bureaucracy, we support these amendments which  include changes to MIP41c3, MIP41c6, and the addition of MIP41c7. The key changes include limiting the number of Interim Facilitators to one, allowing Governance Facilitators to modify the appointment process to suit circumstances, and specifying the responsibilities and compensation of Interim Facilitators. Additionally, the amendment details a process for handling edge cases and acknowledges the reduced input of Maker Governance in the Interim Facilitator selection process. The proposed changes aim to improve continuity and speed while maintaining transparency and integrity. Therefore, we move to support.  Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) - February 13, 2023 Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Voted NO \u2013 while we believe Cogent is more than likely a good U.S. Bank and they perform good loans, unfortunately the timing of this application has three hurdles. The first hurdle, MakerDAO is currently focused on finding highly liquid assets such as U.S. Treasuries with a senior position that can be redeemed easily. This proposal is looking to participate in various types of commercial loans, including commercial and industrial loans, CRE land and development loans, CRE non-owner occupied loans, CRE owner-occupied loans, life insurance loans, consumer and other loans, specialty lending, SBA guaranteed loans, residential lending, and public finance. Second, if the MakerDAO Constitution is passed by MKR token owners, it calls for the implementation of the RWA scope framework through management of arrangers and asset managers, direct exposure to stablecoins, and high-yield real-world asset exposure. The framework also covers principles and requirements related to \u201cclean money,\u201d including the prohibition of direct funding of coal electricity production and ensuring that Real World Asset collateral is allocated based only on risk-adjusted returns. These qualifications  and the definition of high-yield RWA exposure are yet to be determined by MKR token owners. And third, we are currently witnessing the recent regulatory actions taken by U.S. regulators to limit the exposure of traditional banks to the risks associated with the cryptocurrency industry. The Federal Reserve and other agencies have rejected applications from crypto-focused banks and have cautioned traditional banks against working with crypto companies.  Therefore, the regulatory uncertainty alone is strong reasoning to reject this proposal. We ask Cogent to revisit this partnership at a later date, and thank them along with MaxStability LLC for this application. ",

This is where supporting the immediate scope outlined by PECU for this Poll is a prudent requirement that should be supported by MKR token owners. We believe by reviewing the Aave v3 fork, as well as the new interest rate mechanics as part of Spark Lend, will allow MakerDAO to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the DeFi space and incorporate them diligently. By doing so, MakerDAO will be able to open a brand new window that will provide DeFi users with new products. This Audit and Review will help to ensure that the protocol continues to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions and user needs. Moreover, a technical assessment of the Spark Lend initiative, is crucial to ensure that any integration with the D3M are secure and reliable. This will help to prevent any potential security breaches or system failures, which could harm the protocol\u2019s reputation and the trust that users have in it. Additionally, the resubmission to ChainSecurity pending any code changes is important for ensuring the code used in the integration is thoroughly tested and audited to ensure it meets high standards of security and reliability.  Engineering Resource for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 The Phoenix Labs initiative, which is based on the Spark Protocol, has the potential to help future subDAOs scale, and this can benefit the entire MakerDAO ecosystem. By dedicating a full-time engineer (@hexonaut) to this initiative, PECU will support innovation and growth, which is crucial for the long-term success of MakerDAO. This initiative seeks to draw innovation to the periphery of MakerDAO, which will help to create a more robust and decentralized financial system. We move to support. ",

Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter - March 6, 2023 Although we are still skeptical that rETH can scale as a Collateral Type, we do believe that one of the biggest drawbacks of scaling DAI is the barrier to entry via the high Dust parameters for the opening of Vaults. Lowering the dust parameter from 15,000 to 7,500 DAI is a good litmus test to determine the viability of rETH as a collateral type. We move to support and Poll for YES and hope that things can finally get going for rETH as a collateral type. ",

The DeFi community, along with the MakerDAO community, will learn from this experience that relying on one (1) collateral type is not prudent risk management. Although we all understand this, it is often overlooked as we assume others are more astute than ourselves, when in reality, they are not. This experience will be a valuable lesson in Maker\u2019s history and serves as a reminder that the protocol must always aim to be self-sufficient, self-reliant and forever decentralized.

The strategy involves purchasing US Treasuries with maturities equally split over 6 months, so that bi-weekly, a similar amount of US Treasuries mature. The net yield generated will be transmitted to the Surplus Buffer, and if the actual assets held under MIP65 are more than 50 million USD above the proposed MIP105 Asset Allocation Number for Viridian. Assets will be paid into the MIP65 Vault. If the actual assets are more than 50 million USD below this number and the MIP65 Debt Ceiling is not fully utilized, a draw on the Debt Ceiling will be made. Therefore POLL ID 981 is asking to remove the DC-IAM and this would enable the DAO to deploy the additional 750 million USD more quickly into the proposed US Treasury ladder strategy over a 1-week period, as oppose to 8-weeks. We believe this removes the bureaucracy of FINALLY moving the USDC in the PSM and putting such assets to finally provide yield for MakerDAO. It\u2019s also refreshing to see MIP65 using Switzerland based bank Sygnum. We move to support and Vote YES.  Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling - March 13, 2023 We believe that diversifying the risks of USDC via MIP65 can be beneficial for the further growth of the ecosystem. As mentioned above, this proposed strategy involves purchasing short-duration US Treasuries, which can provide a low-risk opportunity for the DAO and generate yields that can be directed to the Surplus Buffer. Additionally, the proposal has been made after considering the financial sustainability of the Maker Protocol, which is essential for long-term growth. We move to support and vote YES.  Short Ratification Poll for Vault Setting Amendment Subproposal (MIP92c5-SP1) - March 13, 2023 This is a proposal that could have used the opinion of Risk CU, as perhaps even the authors of MIP92, which is Yearn Finance and their thoughts on such. Unfortunately with everything that is being proposed and built, it was lost in translation and no feedback was provided. We then believe that the proposed dynamics of the Endgame Constitution push these types of proposals to Creator SubDAOs. Therefore we believe a platform like Spark Lend  and others alike, can use such a strategy and ask the author to propose it to the Creator SubDAO communities that will develop in the near-term. We move to Poll NO.  Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023 Voted YES as it is good to see MIP65 pay back Dividends to the DAO. This is the original intention and we are satisfied so far with the results as we closely monitor the current liquidity crisis across the American financial system. We are stoked to see the excessive amount of USDC in the PSM to finally be put to work. ",

The Maker Constitution was developed to establish a framework for decision-making that reflects the principles of transparency, accountability, and community governance. Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC will always support transparency and the establishment of a community-driven governance system with the use of on-chain governance via the Governance token MKR to facilitate decision-making and incentivize participation. The Maker Constitution not only provides openness and transparency among its DAO members, but it also encourages the public good of giving back for the betterment of humanity. We cannot think of a better opportunity than to finally showcase the goodness that this beautiful technology can provide to the world. Under the Maker Constitution, a portion of the revenue generated by the protocol is set aside for the Public Goods Fund, which is used to support projects that are proposed and approved by the MakerDAO community through a decentralized governance process. We believe that not only does the constitution reinforce a healthy growth of community alignment, but it can also solidify DAI as a stablecoin that has a public good purpose at the core of the project\u2013going beyond simple financial gain. The MakerDAO project\u2019s commitment to supporting public goods and fostering a decentralized governance model reflects a broader mission to promote the development and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. By positioning DAI as a stablecoin that is not only transparent and resilient but also supports the broader public good, the MakerDAO project has the potential to differentiate itself from other stablecoins and build a strong and loyal user base that shares its values and mission. With regards to the The Scope Frameworks, although not fully completed (work-in-progress that anybody can and should contribute to), we believe that they provide a set of guidelines and principles for how DAO decisions should be made, including criteria for determining which types of proposals are within the scope of the MakerDAO\u2019s governance process, how proposals should be evaluated and prioritized, and how decisions should be implemented and enforced. By providing this framework, the Scope Frameworks help to ensure that the MakerDAO operates in a transparent, accountable, and effective manner, and that its decisions are aligned with the interests of its community of stakeholders. They are therefore a crucial component of the Maker Constitution. And last but not least, we believe the Endgame Ecosystems will empower the workforce and the community. By allowing people to be innovative it will reduce friction and increase alignment, turning a zero-sum game into a joint-effort to create value for the greater good of the DAO. It is impossible to engineer a complex system from the top down. It has to emerge from an iterative process of imagination, experimentation, and learning. The Maker Constitution encourages the community to be self-employed and become entrepreneurs because people are not a means to an end but an end in themselves.

These qualities include neutrality, respect, acknowledging the wisdom of the other CES team members, and superb analytical skills. We move to support this Poll and Vote YES.  Ratification Poll for Phoenix Labs - Spark Lend Launch (SPF) (MIP55c3-SP16) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 This is perhaps one of the most exciting announcements this DAO has made since the inception of Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD). The goal of Spark Lend is to provide additional liquidity to the MakerDAO ecosystem by allowing users to borrow and lend a wider range of assets than are currently supported by Maker. Under the proposal, Spark Lend will use DAI as its primary borrowing and lending asset, but would also support a variety of other collateral types, such as ETH, BTC, and other ERC-20 tokens. We believe in the current market environment it is necessary to offer the world options for the opportunity to retain self-custody of their assets. And Spark Lend can provide one of many options available in the DeFi ecosystem. The launch of this platform helps the entire ecosystem, as well as the greater good of people who are desperate to liberate themselves from the failures caused by irresponsible financial market decisions of others.  Ratification Poll for D3M to Spark Lend (MIP116) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 as stated above, Spark Lend will use DAI as its primary borrowing and lending asset, but would also support a variety of other collateral types, such as ETH, BTC, and other ERC-20 tokens. Although we are supportive of Spark lend and for the use of the D3M, we believe that it will be difficult task to scale this platform above $200M. Therefore, we are confident that growth and usage of the D3M will be used in a conservative manner\u2013because users these days need to regain confidence in DeFi. We believe that the max line of 200M DAI will not be reached in 2023. We are also confident that the gap of 50M DAI is a good start and we\u2019ll be surprised if it reaches 100M by EOY.  We hope to be proven wrong.  Ratification Poll for Expand Facilitator Definition to Allow Entities (MIP4c2-SP34) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 we believe it is prudent for MKR token owners to allow facilitators to be redefined from \u201cindividuals\u201d to \u201cauthorized accounts\". We fully support.  Ratification Poll for Risk Facilitator Onboarding (RISK-001) (MIP41c4-SP41) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 The Maker community is a very lucky community. After losing the former Risk-CU facilitator, Primoz\u2013we are now lucky to have the services available of both Rema and MonetSupply. Not only are we lucky, these two individuals along with the rest of their teammates held our hands through the Weekend crisis of Silicon Valley Bank. I can\u2019t think of 2 more qualified individuals that will try their best to keep Maker safe. We support them wholeheartedly and know that they\u2019ll be here, ready, willing, and able for the benefit of MakerDAO.  Ratification Poll for Protocol Engineering Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP42) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 Yet another amazing onboarding of PECU\u2019s Protech Labs. One of the best qualified facilitators in the entire crypto ecosystem, Derek is the voice of Protech Labs and we believe this is a wonderful on-boarding.  Ratification Poll for Starknet CU Budget Extension (SNE-001) (MIP14c2-SP4) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 although this Poll might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal (MIP102c2-SP1), we believe StarkNet CU should have a budget extension until June, 2023 and will then adopt as an Ecosystem Actor.  Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for March 2023 (MIP14c2-SP5) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 although this Poll might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe TechOps CU should have a budget extension for March, 2023 and will then adopt as an Ecosystem Actor. Much needed CU in the Maker ecosystem.  Ratification Poll for Modifying Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit Mandate - SAS-001 (MIP39c2-SP39) - March 13, 2023 Voted YES \u2013 although this Poll might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe SAS-CU plays very well in the Endgame sandbox. This team is super talented and can help out in many ways when it comes to engineering tasks related to the Endgame.  Budget Ratification Poll for TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget (MIP40c3-SP88) - March 13, 2023 1st Rank Choice: Approve NewBear budget - 1,368,924 DAI As Stated Above,  although this Budget Poll request  might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe TechOps CU is a much needed CU in the Maker ecosystem. Unfortunately the current market conditions call for a \u201cbear budget.\u201d  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget (DECO-001) (MIP40c3-SP89) - March 13, 2023 Voted NO \u2013 The recent markets events have made us realized that there is a need for \u201cTerm-DAI\u201d and there\u2019s no other team that has had the time and already built DssGate as it\u2019s primary module to implement such an initiative if MKR token owners decide to go this route. We also believe the talent available in Deco can be used to outsource their talents as resources for the development of the Endgame ecosystem. And that can be define as simply helping build a front-ent for a cluster, or finally sailing this ship into a decentralized IPFS front-end. We believe the team at Deco can deliver. Yes, the community has waited for a fixed rates platform to finally come into fruition, but building out, testing, fuzzing DssGate cannot happen in 25 days. Let\u2019s be realistic and allow this platform to slowly build out and deliver.  Budget Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit DAI Budget 2023-2024 (MIP40c3-SP90) - March 13, 2023 1st Rank Choice: Approve BasePlus budget - 904,805 DAI 2nd  Rank Choice: Approve Base budget - 805,805 DAI Although this Poll might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe GovAlpha is one of the most important components of Maker Governance. The team works day & night to keep the protocol transparent, following guidelines, and they make sure principles of decentralized governance are always in tact. We believe they deserve a BasePlus budget for their dedication and commitment to the MakerDAO community.  Budget Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget Q2 2023 (MIP40c3-SP91) - March 13, 2023 As stated above  Although this Poll might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe GovAlpha is one of the most important components of Maker Governance.  Ratification Poll for Modify Risk Core Unit Budget (RISK-001) (MIP40c3-SP92) - March 13, 2023 1st Rank Choice: Approve reduced budget - 2,484,000 DAI Although this Budget Poll request  might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe Risk CU is a much needed and important CU in the Maker ecosystem. Unfortunately the current market conditions call for a \u201creduced budget.\u201d  Budget Ratification Poll for Modifying Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP93) - March 13, 2023 1st Rank Choice: Approve Bear budget - 1,981,140 DAI Although this Budget Poll request  might be superseded if MKR token owners approved the current Maker Constitution MIP Set proposal(MIP102c2-SP1), we believe SF-CU is a much needed CU in the Maker ecosystem.

This move is a temporary measure, commonly utilized by major financial markets worldwide, and ought to have been implemented beforehand to mitigate the recent market turbulence caused by the regional bank liquidity crisis of 2023. It is our belief that the majority of the community supports this proposal, as reliance on Centralized Governments\u2019 decision-making over the past weekend should not be a dependency for a DeFi protocol.
