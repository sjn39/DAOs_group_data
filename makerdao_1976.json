In the MPA portion related to the NFT \u201cEligibility Package\u201d, there\u2019s a decent amount of metadata that needs to be captured. How is it audited for accuracy since you\u2019re capturing a good amount of fields (Invoice #, amount, currency, etc.) ? Is this Intex Solutions the structured finance analytics provider you\u2019re referring to here, or a typo:  @christiancdpetersen nitpicking here, but on the MPA\u2013should the \u201cMaker Token\u201d also be define as MKR or irrelevant in a court of law? But more importantly\u2013what is the difference between defining the BUYER on the MPA with  a section like \u201cCredit Decision & Information\u201d (acknowledging that the Buyer is  a sophisticated Person) versus, just using the section labeled, \u201cBuyer\u2019s Representations and Warranties\u201d? Does anybody know if the \u201cSettlement Report\u201d will be plugged into a dataset dashboard by either Centrifuge, or Data-Insights CU?

We added them here for completeness sake in the documents, making it as easy as possible for Ankura to act as Loan Verification Agent i.e. they don\u2019t need to guess what is an equivalent investment grade rating for Egan Jones, if it ever came up. (cc: @ejbarraza - you may also like this article from Matt Levine for more context: Bloomberg - Are you a robot?) NFT \u201cEligibility Package\u201d: The underlying loan or offering documents are provided to the Loan Verification Agent to provide the source data for review/audit. Keep in mind, we are also 1) auditing the information we receive from an originator or seller, as we are making an investment decision and need to ensure we have absolute accuracy on details and 2) we make legal reps that the information we send to the Loan Verification Agent are accurate (and have legal liability for gross negligence here) Intex: Yes it\u2019s Intex Solutions Settlement Report: The payments on DROP tokens, via Centrifuge, can already be tracked on-chain (see this message from Seb, for example). Centrifuge also has a number of 3rd party initiatives building data dashboards on top of the Tinlake protocol. We\u2019ve spoken with a number of companies building similar (for example, RWA Company), and will utilize every innovation in this space that we can to deliver information in a transparent and timely manner. For our settlement reports, we\u2019ve already been (and will continue to) work with CES to provide this information in an as transparent (and on-chain native) way as possible, with the intention to move more and more of this on-chain over time (in accordance with the guiding meta of the Spring Cluster i.e. bring RWA on-chain in a more transparent manner vs. focusing on deployment off-chain).
