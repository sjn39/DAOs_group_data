Uniswap borrows governance functionality from COMP and the Compound community, and I think this reference on good governance from Robert Leshner is a great jumping off point:    Compound Community Forum \u2013 13 Jul 20    Good Governance Transitioning governance of the Compound protocol to the community is the most exciting, and powerful experiment we\u2019ve ever conducted.  It\u2019s up to all of us, working together, to create the governance standards and processe that will carry Compound...

Technical changes should be publicly vetted. Proposals should address 1 change at a time.  Please share any other ideas you have about good governance, proposal etiquette, moderation, etc! ",

Hopefully this example will show people making a proposal shouldn\u2019t be a 2 second thing where you click a few buttons and that\u2019s it. Proposals take time and require hard thinking, open discussion and dissection and auditing both by knowledgeable community members and then a trusted 3rd party before finally reaching the proposal stage at which point the community vote if this is the change they really want (hopefully by the time the final stage is reached the community would have known its what they want) ",
