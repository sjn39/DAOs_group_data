                    "content": "Hi Everyone,  bump  Now that the protocol is bringing in over 250k DAI per day I wanted to open discussion/action on whether we should increase the lots (bump) of FLAP auctions. Once the surplus buffer threshold is reached, we would have a new FLAP auction more than every hour at current rates (not to mention what incomes may be in 2 months). This means that the FLAP auctions would likely be less efficient due to gas costs and slippage. Pros  Less auctions allows for more competitive auctions as there are less to participate in. Less gas wasted on numerous auctions  Cons  Increased lots will price out smaller MKR holders Increased risk/losses if no one bids or bids too low.  What should the `bump` parameter be set to for FLAP auctions? Please vote for all options you would accept.     10k (No Change) 20k (+10k) 30k (+20k) 50k (+40k) 100k (+90k) Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps This signal request will run until 2021-03-18T04:00:00Z. If a result other than \u201cNo Change\u201d gains a majority I will create an on-chain poll to vote on March 22nd, 2021.  ttl With increased risk of losses in larger lots, should we also increase the ttl of FLAP auctions for more time to participate? Would love to hear from @Risk-Core-Unit on whether this is advisable. I will create a poll for this below but it would also be great to get a recommendation from mandated actors. Pros  More time for auction participants to accrue funds to participate  Cons  Chance of less efficient auctions due to uncertainty of MKR price for auction participants   What should the `ttl` for FLAP auctions be?     60 minutes (No Change) 90 minutes 120 minutes 180 minutes Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps This signal request will run until 2021-03-18T04:00:00Z.

                    "content": "My personal 2 cents on this is that an increase of the bump to 20k or maybe even 30k would cause no problems at all and in fact would be a very good idea. There are only a handful of regular flap keepers and all of them currently have enough MKR to do 2 or 3 auctions simultaneously. Yet as you say - it would greatly reduce gas wastage, saving between 3 and 5 transactions per auction depending on the keeper and their exact strategy. This slippage was one of the factors behind the original 2% beg being an insufficient incentive and kicked off our recent discussions around raising it to 4%. I definitely wouldn\u2019t go as high as 50k, however, because a) at that point capital DOES start to become a constraint for some and b) pools such as MKR-ETH on Uniswap (which is where most keepers currently hedge) are just not that liquid yet, and if you tried to trade that sort of size there currently you would end up giving back MORE slippage through market impact than you saved from the reduced gas costs.

                    "content": "Raising the ttl on the other hand, I personally would say is very inadvisable. At 60 mins it\u2019s already a bit too high given the recent volatility and disincentivises keepers from taking on asymmetric risk for that long - knowing that if the mkt goes a few % against them they lose money, but if it goes a few % the other way they will likely simply get dimed by another bot who did not have to deal with the costs of kicking the auction. Clearly this is not ideal given that the whole rationale behind raising the beg recently was to increase keeper participation and reduce the risk of the 0 bids we had increasingly been seeing. But for sure there is a tradeoff here, which is what doopson and I have been wrestling back and forth over - namely that if the ttl is TOO short then that too is counterproductive as it gives the 0 bids a BETTER chance of winning again before anyone spots them. So in the end we kind of agreed that the current combination of 60 mins and 4% was probably the optimal way of balancing these 2 risks. In my opinion though any further increase to the ttl would also require a corresponding increase of the beg to keep the attractiveness to keepers unchanged. ",
