The good news is the peg is looking slightly better, but we\u2019re also nearing the debt ceiling again. As has been the policy lately I think we should raise the ETH-A debt ceiling again by 80 million. There is significant demand for Dai minting right now (especially from ETH. USDC-A has dropped off). There will be a governance poll going out later today for this, but would be great to get some community thoughts as well. Given that the current utilization rate is so high, it would be good to get this to an exec vote as soon as possible IMO. Edit (LFW): Poll is now live. ",
