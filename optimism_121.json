The UI on https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check Actually still shows this, so I find this to be a bit confusing and also concerning - could devs check to make sure this doesn\u2019t introduce potential new vulnerabilities in some capacity? Would like to Delegate all tokens to myself essentially going forward as I feel being involved in Optimism gives me a an excellent perspective on what will help the ecosystem move forward.
