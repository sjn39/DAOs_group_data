                    "content": "Hi Katie, In addition to the collateral onboarding (COB) process that Nikolaj provided, it\u2019s important to read through MIP 6-12. The initial COB process was defined by the mandated actors and as the CUs were being formed. During that time, there wasn\u2019t a single owner/facilitator of the COB and the team used their best efforts to manage the process and the work flowing through the system. Today, we have two collateral stakeholder teams, onchain and offchain, that are working on the next iteration of the process. In the current documentation, some of the labels/terms might be outdated but the process remains the same and we use it. Most of the challenges today have to do with communication and transparency. The Collateral Status Index was a great start for communications but the needs of the community has grown and this is going through a revamp. In addition to the above, the two key areas for improvements are the Collateral Application and Prioritization processes. For collateral Applications, we\u2019ve provided some clarity to the community and will circle back around to redesign the process. This will require MIP changes and take a bit of time to work through the governance process\u2026the nature of the beast. IMO, in addition to communicating the status, by phase, of all the collaterals in the COB, the Prioritization process is the key issue right now. The process and current list of priorities needs to be made transparent to the community. This is a top priority for CES right now and we\u2019re working through this in our stakeholder alignment meetings. To be clear, we do have a Collateral Onboarding process today and it\u2019s important to follow this process then make changes to better support the protocol and community. ",

Domain collateral assessments are created and published to the Maker Forum while awaiting the posting of a Governance Poll on the following Monday.  The domain collateral assessments are created by the MakerDAO Risk, Oracle, and Smart Contracts domain teams and contain in-depth evaluations of collateral types. The goal of the assessments is to provide information to help inform the MakerDAO governance community.   The documentation and the MIP set for collateral onboarding (MIP6-12) was written before the Core Unit framework was implemented, thus it refers to domain teams. You can see which teams have been ratified as domain teams here. Today with the CU framework in place a more clear description would probably be that the Risk, Oracles, Protocol Engineering, CES and RWF CUs provide the assessments. While you could argue our Core Unit mandate should suffice, for the sake of completeness to be inline with the old MIP set CES has a pending application to be ratified as a domain team as well, while the other Core Units are already ratified previously as domain teams (Oracles Domain Team = Oracles CU, Smart Contracts Domain Team = PECU, Risk Domain Teams = Risk CU and RWF CU).     Katie:  Are there other teams that are able to make assessments and onboarding parameters to move things forward or is entirely dependent on RWF?   The Maker Community can always elect more teams or individuals to provide assessments through existing MIP frameworks or through new MIPs.     Katie:  This is all very unclear from my perspective, and I imagine others as well.   I completely agree that the process can be confusing and frustrating, which is exactly what we in CES are working on improving. This is all helpful in terms of determining where the blind spots in today\u2019s process and documentation are. ",

So they are mentioned in the process, but not directly as the RWF Core Unit, but as a Risk Domain Team. You are correct that this could be described more clearly, and we will make sure this will be updated to be more clear in the docs. While it is not a perfect process, and we are striving to improve it, this is the process that was ratified by Maker holders almost two years ago in MIP6-12 and is still the process we are following today. All of the points described here still hold true today. However as Robert noted, we\u2019re currently revising this process trying to make improvements and provide much more clarity and transparency into the ongoing work.     monkey.irish:  IMO, in addition to communicating the status, by phase, of all the collaterals in the COB, the Prioritization process is the key issue right now. The process and current list of priorities needs to be made transparent to the community. This is a top priority for CES right now and we\u2019re working through this in our stakeholder alignment meetings.   You are correct that the documentation could be much better. The documentation was written 1.5 years ago in the Maker Foundation. No one has been maintaining it until it was recently transferred to CES. We are currently reviewing it as some of it is outdated, and we will strive to keep this resource up to date moving forward. This is part of our enablement strategy in our CU mandate. It\u2019s a work in progress currently, but definitely a big focus point for us in the short term.     Katie:  Are there any specifications around what elements need to be included in an assessment from RWA and where that information can be found?   As far as I know, the only requirements are outlined in MIP12c1 - besides this I believe it is up to the teams to decide their methodology for assessment. I can\u2019t really speak for other teams, however as far as I understand, RWF is actually trying to formalize their methodology as proposed in their recent MIP67. ",

The evolution of collateral onboarding process over the last 18 months is partially responsible for the some of the pains we are experiencing now. For example, the entire initiative for RWAs. The details of RWAs were unknown when we (members of the community\u2026including Charles, Long, Rune, planet_x, others) wrote the first collateral onboarding MIPs. The collateral onboarding process was also community driven and based upon these initial MIPs. Since then, the community has been evolving rapidly. We went from trying to onboard every collateral we could find, exhausting those tokens, offboarding some, creating the WBTC market, experimenting with other strategies like LP tokens, adding PSMs and institutional vaults, and now D3Ms, RWAs, & L2s. This history is important and it\u2019s easy to forget. To have any process withstand this amount of change and not having a Core Unit focus on it (until now), is impossible. Yes, we need a better process for onboarding collateral. So, what is being done?  We have a process and while the verbiage little dated, it\u2019s the one we attempt to follow and use best efforts to do so. We are currently updating these docs now to reflect the labels/terms we are currently using.   COB Process Flow-sum1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB    We have two ongoing stakeholder alignment groups (CMON - onchain and CMOFF - offchain) that GovComms facilitates. These are a cross-functional group of people that are responsible for shared initiatives and ongoing work. @Davidutro is the organizer of these meetings.   We have to do a better job following our current processes. We got a little sloppy since we didn\u2019t have a collaborative process to follow until SES and GovComms spearheaded the stakeholder alignment process. The collateral onboarding process is actually pretty good\u2026if we follow it. It does require people to read the docs. It\u2019s also very clear that we need to do much more education and get feedback on what isn\u2019t working. I mean, the feedback for me is pretty clear right now based upon the conversations/actions in the forums.   We have to do a better job at communication. This is HUGE! We are getting ready to revise the Collateral Status Index to be much more meaningful and to reflect statuses by phases in the onboarding process above.   We have to do a better job at transparency. IMO, this key issue right now as you and others have clearly articulated. Very few people know how collateral truly gets onboarded. In addition to publishing statuses, being as transparent as possible about the prioritization and assessment process is job #1. The most challenging aspect of transparency is to drive all of the subjectivity around decisions out of the process. In reality, I\u2019ve never experienced where that was the case\u2026but I\u2019m open to it! Given our current situation, the community is starting to take on the prioritization and assessment role. We are working in our stakeholder alignment meetings to come up with a clear system of prioritization and assessment but it\u2019s challenging given the collateral complexity and varying opinions of the community.   We have to get collateral through the process and onboarded. 100\u2019s of person hours are going into discussions on how to do something and this prevents work getting done. Please understand this new style of \u201cfast track\u201d MIPs WILL NOT solve the problems and I believe it will only make it worse.     the community is starting to take on the prioritization and assessment role   This is such a key point for several reasons:   It\u2019s the recognition that prioritization and assessment are two critical phases in the collateral onboarding process. We might move them around in the process\u2026but they still need to be done whether from Domain Teams or the community.   The DAO does not have a clear set of objectives and strategies to effectively prioritize the competing priorities of on and off chain collateral. We have a reactionary bias right now and respond to whatever we feel is important. In order for us to do effective prioritization of our collateral, we need clear objectives to know, which next piece of collateral has highest probability of adding value to the protocol. Otherwise, I\u2019m prepared to design a process where we put prioritization up for a weekly onchain vote and allow the preferences of the masses to decide.   All of this to say there is A LOT of work being done right now and more coming to help clarify, educate, prioritize, assess, and share the progress of collateral being onboarded to the protocol. Given our current process, all indications show me that the future will be a collaborative process in which the community plays a much greater role than today. ",
