Medium \u2013 14 Mar 20    Black Thursday for MakerDAO: $8.32 million was liquidated for 0 DAI Data from the Ethereum shows that 36% of liquidations on March 12\u201313 were auctions with zero bids, liquidators earned 62K ETH for free Reading time: 6 min read       I am simply opening up this topic for discussion and an eventual poll. Realize Maker has already eaten about 2/3 of the loss here and what is left is 2/3+.13(iquidation fee) =.79 or no more than 21% of the total.  The reason is that vault holders were already paid 2/3 ETH liquidation value in DAI as the loan on their collateral.   They did not experience a total loss and could not be expected to be compensated more than this 21% difference at the time they were liquidated. Put simply while the whole auction bid 0 effect is something Maker needs to look at, the vault owner is on the hook for borrowing sufficient amount to put themselves at risk of liquidation so I think while Maker has eaten 2/3 already one can make arguments for both sides of this and wonder if even 10-20% liquidation value as compensation to vault owners is worth discussing.

There are several points that I think need to be considered:   The full extent of the risk to capital was not made very clear on the oasis borrow site. The liquidation penalty was displayed as 13%.   The full extent of the risk was made clear in the documentation of the system, and in the liquidation FAQ.   $0 bids were not a bug in the Maker Protocol itself, but rather an unfortunate combination of events that combined to make it difficult for auctions to clear efficiently.   $0 bids could have been made less likely by being more conservative with the auction parameters that governance voted in when activating MCD.   @MakerMan makes good points above as to the actual value that could be categorized as \u2018lost\u2019 given the value of the loan.   The amount of compensation to Vault Holders would probably be relatively small in comparison to the losses the Protocol has already sustained, but this needs to be confirmed before we can vote on this in an informed manner.   The PR impact of the $0 liquidations has been relatively heavy, providing compensation could be a way to mitigate that impact.   Some auctions cleared at 50% of the value of the collateral, and there were a smattering that cleared between $0 and 50% OSM price, if we do compensate, do we include these users that already got something back?   We need to be somewhat careful around setting precedents here. When will we or won\u2019t we compensate liquidated Vaults in the future?   Personally I\u2019m on the fence regarding this topic. Initially I was in favor due in a large part to point 1, 6 and 7. But now I find myself leaning more to the other side, based on points 2, 3 and 5. I\u2019d love to hear more points of view from other members of the community. As a quick sidenote, lets try to keep the language and discourse in this thread as compassionate as possible to those that were liquidated. No one has enjoyed the last few days. I would appreciate it if any Vault Holders that do chime in pay the Maker community the same respect as we discuss this. ",

The oasis dapp clearly says only liquidation penalty. This is highly misleading. Hence the makerdao should come up for the complete losses. I think most of the cdp owners would never have opened a cdp if they knew the truth - and never will open another one. This has the potential to throw back defi a decade. You simply cannot demand from a mainstream customer to read the docs. I didn\u2019t know about this fact, and I consider myself as a tech girl. Best regards, Benita ",

This was an unprecedented event and it is unfortunate that risks in total to the community may not have been made as clear as some wish.  A lot of effort and attention was paid to doing just that and rest assured any inaccuraces in that will be corrected and addressed. The market could have quickly gone to $50 and even if your collateral cleared it may have not been enough to cover your borrowed DAI.   This is the real reality with collateralized loans where backing collateral value relative to the stablecoin being borrowed drops precipitously. Even if the best market prices were paid virtually all borrowers who were liquidated AT BEST would have had no more than 21% of their collateral left in their vaults based on the current configuration of the system and I want all of you to know that Maker and MKR holders are basically eating the other 79% of the losses on all of the 0 auction bid losses. I also want DAI holders to realize IF the system ever experiences a Emergency SHutdown the DAI PEG will theoretically follow a value curve related to the combined Collateral Oracle OSM price/LIVE collateral price.    I skip doing the sum over BAT and ETH and simply consider ETH.  IF the system is ES\u2019d at $100 USD/ETH and the price falls to $50 USD/ETH the DAI peg value based on backing collateral in the system would be .5USD.   Similarly if the price increased to $200 the DAI PEG value would approach $2 USD/DAI.   These and many other risks are present. I spent a long time before purchasing DAI and using the system to borrow before I entered these markets and hope others will do the same\u2026 Again I am sorry for your loss and hope the value you hold of the loan at least provides some partial compensation for your collateral.!

I presume that: a) Maker borrow app/site is built for users, not developers. Hence: b) Maker borrow app/site doesn\u2019t warn users about potential loss over 13%. c) It doesn\u2019t ask if a user has read developer docs and fully understant all possible risks. So I think it\u2019s easy to amend Maker borrow app/site to put all responsibility on a user and avoid covering users\u2019 unexpected losses in the future. As for now, you decide. I want to add I use Maker for a long time since SCD and I get used to think that penalty is 13%. The app never didn\u2019t challenge this my belief. Honestly when all the congestion has started and I had to quickly manage my CDPs I even hoped to get liquidated to avoid paying lots of money for many transactions (CDPSaver offered me to repay my dept on a single CDP for just $237). If I only knew all the risks I wouldn\u2019t be so careless and don\u2019t loose anything. ",

I would like to reiterate and put up for discussion the 3 main points why i believe a compensation in MKR tokens (from foundation or inflation) should be considered: 1. Disclaimed Risk I opened the CDP in the official app under the impression that the maximum penalty fee would be 13%, being liquidated at the Maker Oracle ETH price. In my opinion the UI should have said 13%+, link to the docs/disclaimers and explicitly explain full ETH price risks involved with liquidation auctions. I do understand MakerDAO is in an earlier stage of it\u2019s development and I will use Maker again if my initial understanding of the risk is fully met. 2. Responsibility & Risk Mitigation After having my CDP open for a while, i have read through the docs briefly and understood, that the liquidation ETH price may vary according to Auction Bids. I trusted MakerDAO to have put in place a strong Keeper Infrastructure to mitigate the risks of the known issue that has been exploited a few days ago. Even i found it extremly hard to learn anything about the existing Keeper Infrastructure, I put my trust into MakerDao on the infrastructure side. I consider MakerDAO a legit project with an inspiring and well-funded development team. This team decided to promote opening CDPs via Coinbase Earn to less tech-savy users, which made me believe that the project and infrastructure is reasonably mature and may stand challenging market situations. If i had known the actual keeper situation, i may have under no circumstances risked a liquidation.  In my opinion there should have been more transparency and risk mitigation. It should have been promoted and incentivized to act as a keeper, earn penalty fees and support the network. I will use Maker again, if Maker admits responsibility to enforce a solid infrastructure. I will see the compensation of fully liquidated vaults as an indication of these. 3. PR and Trust Enforcement I have used the CDPs as a tool to fund the on-going development of my company\u2026so i convinced people around me to accept DAI and make themself familiar with MakerDAO\u2026i have encouraged my peers to trust Maker and many have been using DAI and even opened CDPs as well\u2026 If Maker decides to not compensate losses i may be discouraged to ever use it again and all my peers will feel that. Furthermore it seems clear to me, that the value of rebuilding trust with early supporters outweights the value of the compensation massively. The compensation may look like:  Figure out all liquidated Vaults on 12/13.03.2020 Calculate ETH that should have been paid back to liquidated Vaults with the Maker Oracle ETH Price at the time of liquidation. The ETH Price may be discounted by ~5% which would represent actual conditions considering a rather solid Keeper Infrastructure. Mint/Allocate MKR that match the ETH value from point 2 at the time of minting those. Airdrop all liquidated Vaults from point 1 (transfer not more than 7 MKR per day to each vault address to avoid temporary selling pressure)  In my opinion a very fair deal. I would be happy to keep some MKR tokens and support the project growing up. ",

If I were to try to justify it now, I might say: \u2018Well keepers stand to gain significantly from auctions, so they\u2019ll pay the gas prices even in the case of severe congestion,\u2019 but in reality the issue of network congestion didn\u2019t strike me as an issue at the time.  I\u2019d like to hear from MKR holders why they thought the old configuration was reasonable at the time, given what we all know about network congestion.  I would also say that in my experience, this is an overestimation of what MKR governance as a collective knows about ethereum network congestion. There are a lot of aspects of both the Maker Protocol and Ethereum that we should know, and many of those involved have limited time with which to study up. Probably not something that is comforting to hear, but nonetheless true. ",

Hard to disagree with point 1. Regarding point 2, there was some effort made to promote people to act as keepers, though this fell short of the mark. Part of what makes this difficult is that we can\u2019t really make keepers sign up to a list so that we know how many there are (nor could we trust such a list even if we did attempt it.) Potentially the dev\u2019s could build some sort of signal mechanism into the keeper bot, such that it called off to some API while it was active. This would be fairly trivial to spoof as a malicious attacker though. Needs some thought. Point 3 is also hard to disagree with, it\u2019s pretty obvious that people are feeling angry with the outcome, if we can smooth things over then we should.   Figure out all liquidated Vaults on 12/13.03.2020 Calculate ETH that should have been paid back to liquidated Vaults with the Maker Oracle ETH Price at the time of liquidation.

Mint/Allocate MKR that match the ETH value from point 2 at the time of minting those. Airdrop all liquidated Vaults from point 1 (transfer not more than 7 MKR per day to each vault address to avoid temporary selling pressure)   This seems mostly solid to me. A couple of comments:  On point 2: this will still result in some losing 100% of their collateral. Price moves were swift, and the Oracles only update once an hour. On point 3/4: Mechanically the way this would work (if governance agreed to go ahead with this) is to mint unbacked Dai (not MKR) and distribute it to the affected parties. The bad debt created by this payout of unbacked Dai would then be dealt with via further MKR auctions (FLOPs).  ",

I am not sure if its actually possible to fully understand the entire system (risks), each part is constantly changing and all those changes interact with other parts, changing them. It is not reasonable to expect every user to understand those dynamics. \u2026 Maker is actively marketing the product. From the disclaimers I have seen on multiple UIs 13% is generally presented as the liquidation penalty. Presentation of the system in this manner is significant. I also agree with characterizations others have made describing the keeper situation as a \u201cfailure\u201d. MKR holders ratified foundation devs work on auctions and the mechanism did not work as intended. Failure is expected in such a experimental system, complete collapse has not taken place yet so this is still an excellent learning opportunity. The desire to learn and grow yields deeper understanding. Here\u2019s my thoughts on recognizing users that were misled: First point: Marketing needs to match the reality of the system. Maker is a really expensive experiment that basically no one understands completely. No one knows exactly how the maker specific software infrastructure, governance ( and all its messy social/economic realities), ethereum, and the wider crypto/global market will interface with each other. The robustness of MCD is unknown, it has only been live for ~5 months, and it was not released completely finished. Things like the GSM were to risky to implement immediately and the dark fix mechanism needed to be conceived. Migration from SAI hasn\u2019t even finished\u2026 Many other governance tools still need to be developed (both social and technical). For example on black thursday LFW and I were going to give the first presentation on a formal collateral on boarding process. Almost half a year into MCD and no clear path for onboarding collateral had been substantiated. Sorry for rant  . TLDR:  This recognition does not compensate vault holders, but defines a responsibility for matching marketing (communications) to the presently understood reality of the system. This obligation aligns with \u201cscientific governance\u201d rather than business inspired marketing which aims to communicate simply and promote the system. Second point: some sort of compensation: Way trickier, its hard to judge how vaults \u201cshould\u201d of been liquidated because its an auction, the market was going crazy, which would of influenced bidding regardless of how many keepers were participating. As Maker_Man stated at best 21% of the collateral would of been returned. Compensation should be less than 21% of loss collateral. Arbitrary, but how about returning 10% to vaults which lost more than 90% of their collateral? Calculated in terms of eth. I\u2019m not knowledgeable enough on gathering eth data to do this, but I am pretty sure it would be possible to figure out. Maker still isn\u2019t in the clear, its an active situation, so in my mind the actual compensation for vault holders has to come in the future. The short term stability of the system is very much in question currently, adding a larger deficit right now might be dangerous. Also the dev team has little to no extra bandwidth. Thanks everyone for their stories and rationales. ",

The users accepted and actively managed the risk of their CDPs and the product that was advertised to them. Any average user would be fine with any clearly stated slippage. (IE, Uniswap) There was no way for the average user to prepare for the critical failures of the bidding system/liquidity or to manage the risks associated with the inner workings of the platform, by definition that is the MKRs. The documentation, UI, and even general chat did very very little to allude the risks to users. I\u2019m a very active user in the crypto space, probably as savvy as a non-coding user gets and this still blind sided me. I spent time researching and trying to read medium articles prior to the dip trying to figure out what was my best option in general for that day. There was nothing that alluded to how complicated this system was and I had to go to chat just to get a somewhat passing answer and still got fooled with the 0$ bids when I decided to just pay a fee instead of taxing myself beyond a 13% effort. At the very least setting everything about the users aside. 0$ bids in this market is a critical design flaw. There has never been 0$ ETH. The system was obviously not tested for a \u201cBlack Swan\u201d event or w.e despite all the hub bub about the emergency shut down etc. Congestion is not a good excuse as we are all crypto veterans and understand congestion intimately. This was a critical failure of the DAO to provide liquidity and use the available markets/tools/resources available pro-actively. I would be very very hesistant to ever use MakerDAO again until I know that the code has been reviewed in all the places where it\u2019s just \u201cassumed\u201d that there will be enough good actors/liquidity. There should be fail-safes/plans for every outcome and a strong steady general belief that the system always needs review. Anything less and why bother. If it\u2019s my responsibility as a CDP holder to audit your code and assume operational risk as well I will simply use the better market options provided and save myself the headache. ",

For example if someone had 100 ETH covering a loan of 5,000 Dai, even if they where liquidated at the bottom of the market price for ETH around 95 dollars they would have 40.52633 ETH remaining = 100 ETH - 5000/95 ( ETH sold at lowest market price to cover debt.) - ( .13 * 5000 )/95 ( 13 percent liquidation penilty).  I think this would be a first step in repairing the damage done by running a monopoly auction or mono culture auction with liquidating assets. ",

Because of the flaw in MakerDao I ended up being forced to sell Eth to payback dai and close my CDP at such a loss I was left with over 750 ETH less than I should have been. Had I been liquidated I would have lost everything and had I been liquidated correctly I would have more ETH left than I do now. But if compensation is on the table I feel like those like me should also be compensated the difference so everyone effected by what happened is compensated fairly and equally. I hope this gets heard because the entire history of these events can be seen on my vault number 2288 and by that vault number owner address Needless to say this caused a much bigger loss than necessary and I would have been much better being leverage long on any major centralized exchange. I don\u2019t see how we as CDP owners can feel confident enough in this system feel confident enough to create dai again. I believe there needs to be a show of good faith in doing right by all vaults both liquidated and force closed be compensated according to how things should have been under the correct liquidation conditions so that confidence in opening CDPS can be restored.

We can use the MKR price before the drop as a fair value ($400-$500)? Additionaly, how about taking some MKR from (large?) wallets that never voted?

I\u2019m a finance guy, not a coder. I think the maker community should ask who they are looking for as Vault holders. As a retail buyer I have to put some level of trust that I\u2019m not exposed to any non-obvious risks as I do with all other products I approach in life where I don\u2019t have detail knowledge and pour over the fine print. Trust in brands is there for a reason - I buy at amazon because I trust they\u2019ll compensate a reasonable claim even if they technically don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t need to read fine print on an apple product - I understand the broad strokes and it works. As a customer of the platform I\u2019m disappointed in having to have taken a big loss for a non-obvious risk. I take the liquidation penalty etc for what it is on the chin. I feel as an early adopter I\u2019m contributing to the growing of the platform like everyone else\u2026 If this is just seen as a future improvement I feel a little betrayed to be honest. You have to ask how many retail buyers will risk this - knowing non-obvious risks are for their own account. If you want only coding pros in the platform I suppose that\u2019s fair enough, but please advertise that you need to be a coding expert - don\u2019t go for the easy user interface to draw in the public, let them smooth out the kinks while you rake in the cash. Emotional wording, but this is where the platform ethos will be tested. 21% or whatever is such significant money for those of us who had a significant chunk of life savings in there. And for those who will say I was a fool\u2026 I know. I\u2019ll deal with that part too apart from this. ",

Ethereum had to make a choice, to let the code be law and let 14% of all ether holders fall on a spike or make them whole. They had a tough choice to make but chose to support their users. There were consequences for that and the chain had a split and why we now we have ETC. Did Ethereum recover in spades and still exists? When GDAX (Coinbase) had a flash crash of ether down to $0.10 due to a cascade of margin calls triggering stop looses in 2017 GDAX initially stated that their systems worked properly as it should but still after a few days refunded all the losses to their customers from their own pocket (in the millions). The company recovered and still exists and operates today due to that. They understood that they either took the loss or would simply never recover from the negative PR point of view. Letting your users fall on a spike because there was a \u201cfine print\u201d somewhere explicitly stating the user accepts the risks is never good policy. Trust is more important than money. There is no money without trust, much less a user base. 36% of vaults got liquidated with 0 bids. ",

                    "content": "I want to thank everyone for posting here.  My heart goes out to all of you in this system as the first movers.  I generally find this community to be knowledgable, gracious and understanding even in the face of loss.   I can\u2019t express enough how much this gives me hope that we can hurdle this and move on. As posted if you want to share your liquidation story in detail please see the other thread I have opened up for this purpose (documenting and allowing vault owners to make their cases for what they feel is fair compensation).     Black Thursday Vault owners report Thread Collateral Discussion       Posting as a gist because this website wouldn\u2019t let me post multiple pics or images  Full damage report below\u2026 this was majority of my savings.  You will need to click the following gist link below.     There are two reasons I started these two threads.  (1) To show that at least one person isn\u2019t just thinking about you but advocating for you.  (2)  To allow the community to discuss the issue. As a previous business owner I infrequently encountered situations where a customer would felt unhappy with a deal and we both were sitting on two sides of a resolution fence with different amounts.   In those cases for the sake of attempting to make someone happy and resolving the issue with least pain for both I would typically offer to \u2018split the difference\u2019.   The condition on agreement was the customer would relinquish litigation rights and also would not carry out negative PR campaign of any sort in exchange for me coughing up some cash. I think in my decade or two of business I only had maybe 10-20 cases over 10\u2019s of thousands of closed deals.   In the end people might not have been happy but it solidified my position as a business operator of integrity and someone who could be relied on not just to do good business but to also act in ways consistent with a final attempt at disagreement resolution vs. a typical sorry but \u2018sue me then\u2019 approach\u2026 In this vein I would be advocating the same to the Maker community.  My voice is small.  Yours as the collective of people who actually used the system and would likely be the ones to use it again that needs to be heard.  Before the community can take any action we need to know the sum total of the possible damages and so you need to make your case because I know whatever the community does we will not be doing this piecemeal but treated as a whole group. Again I want to thank people for civility and curteousy in discussing what I know are difficult and emotinally charged issues.   Everything in this ecosystem is new, untested and fraught with hazard.  Please do not keep more wealth in this system than you can afford to lose and do your utmost best to understand the full risk of hazards because I find them to be quite overwhelming. My wife always told me she never counted on $1 from anything in crypto because it could be gone at any time.   It is weeks like the last that we come to realize not just crypto - but heck entire financial system can belly up 50% down pretty quickly. Be safe, covid-19 free, and give thanks for important things in your lives - it is likely a good number of us may not be around to pick up the pieces within a year but also likely a lot will.    Humans have endured far worse than this and as Morpheus says \u201cWE ARE STILL HERE!\u201d  I for one look to the past for guidance and do my best to use this information to drive us towards a better future.   I am a great analyst but unfortunately a terrible salesman. The entirity of the above are only my comments and not representative of the Maker community at large. ",

I made the decision to liquidate based on the assumption I would get 21 percent of my collateral back, which, given where the network and market were at that point, seemed like a reasonable decision. It is arguable. Instead I got less than one percent of my collateral back due to a flaw in the system design. I would not expect Maker to compensate me for more than 21 percent. If they do, I will use their products again. If they don\u2019t, I won\u2019t. The ability to manage risk is a huge part of what we do in this space. That 79 percent number has factored into my calculations for years. That is what it means to be \u201caware of the risks.\u201d I cannot manage risk if the numbers Maker reports are off by 21 percent. Without restitution, I and others in my position will have to assume that all of the numbers Maker reports do not reflect the reality. That, for me, is enough to disqualify the protocol entirely. I would gently suggest that the Maker community consider what kind of user would be alright with those circumstances, and whether a community composed of such individuals is the one they are looking to build.

                    "content": "I would also like to add, seperate from my earlier post, the critical design flaw that the CDP holders would never understand looking at the system or opening a CDP at any point. CDP holders make a CDP (CDP Holders ALWAYS assume their ETH has a Value Greater than 0) CDP Holders are never wrong in this sentiment. ETH is never 0$ on the market. Scenario - CDPs are Liquidated At this point the system auctions the ETH with a starting price of 0. At this point, Keepers can still bid 0 and claim the auction. This means one of two things, first the auction will \u201caccept bids of the same amount\u201d even though no auctioneer would. IE 0 for 0 bids. Gas is not a bid amount, simply the equivalent of raising your bid for the auctioneer. The auctioneer should always be the one holding at 0, or in this case the first bid of 0 via default.  Even worse, and likely what is coded, the system values ETH at less than 0  despite having a pricefeed and being here\u2026 in crypto\u2026 This alone is what ensures the responsibility is not on the CDP holders. At no point, ever, would any CDP holder ever agree that their ETH is less than 0$ and would accept 0$ as a bid of equal or greater value at any point. In any scenario it would be a voided bid in a normal auction, especially in your normal real life auctions with simple reserves. Reserve prices that should have been set via checking available liquidity and pricefeeds etc.  The DAO failed at properly running the auction though they do like to say how \u201cthe code worked\u201d. Yes, the code worked but the CDP holders never got a auction. How you can even say this is an auction is baffling as no actual bidding ever took place. The system never received a bid. IE, 0 is not a bid it has no monetary value. The fact that the system valued 0$ more than ETH is a design flaw if not just intentionally malicious due to how egregious an oversight it truly is. Anybody who set up this part of the code and is familiar with auctions could easily see the opportunity cost, which they did, and act on it during this scenario, again which they did due to having experience with the system in ways CDP holders could not. It was even worse due to the way it was setup as there were multiple keepers bidding 0$. Again, no mechanics in place to ensure a bid greater than the holding price actually occurred or even bids worth at least 5%~ of the value the DAO was loaning DAI at. If you added a disclaimer that said \u201cWarning: ETH deposited is valued at less than 0$\u201d nobody would have used the system at all, but that\u2019s exactly what the system values ETH at and is completely and utterly counter intuitive to the idea of Collateral. There should never have been a scenario where Assets could be so utterly undervalued (<0$) in a collateralized loaning system with pricefeeds. By very definition of those auction prices the global emergency shutdown would trigger if ETH was that low. I\u2019m surprised that wasn\u2019t even a soft check somewhere with how much discussion it had. Expecting any user to be this savvy with the poorly coded machine logic of a system they\u2019ve never coded when they likely can\u2019t even code is crazy. If that is the general sentiment of the DAO I would advise rebranding/fixing UI for a much more niche tech-heavy audience and letting Coinbase/Binance etc offer safe lending for users and widespread adoption in general. Had this liquidated too many more users the DAO was likely to die. Edit - It\u2019s really confusing because if you did want to start at 0$ you could do so so so many things to ensure some level of value. They didn\u2019t even enforce \u201c3 minimum bids\u201d or anything to ensure price left the floor or that there was active participation. Literally nothing and I\u2019m wondering how much actual auction experience the devs really had and how well they explained this process to their members, if at all. I would really like to see the chat if there was ever any about the auction system. Had the system even forced the price to 1$ I would admit a bid took place, but saying that somebody bid \u201c0$ for 0$\u201d just because of gas is silly and valuing ETH at less than 0$ is negligent. Entirely and utterly neglecting the logic/testing behind a key part of the system/lack of audit caused this. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ve had time to collect my thoughts after a pretty sizable chunk of my ETH got liquidated.  Liquidated on the 03/12 when 100% of my collateral (~606 ETH) was sold for 53$/ETH when market price was hovering between $105-$110 with only 2 bidders participating and no lot even entering DENT phase. Did not clearly understand risks due to false advertising (only looked into auction mechanism after liquidation, UIs clearly did not communicate the risks to end user) Would not use system nor vocally support (I had been a supporter before) the product again unless auctions module changes drastically, definitely not ready for mass adoption even in the crypto community Do not understand reasoning behind targeting only developers with the auction process In my opinion, MKR holders lost the plot on Day 1 of 0$ bids. I think global settlement should have been activated with DAI holders and 0$ bid liquidations compensated after. This would have limited losses over the next few days. This was only reinforced after looking through the list of liquidations recently. Liquidations on March 16th were going for 85$/eth with 3 bidders and this was close to a week after the 0$ bids with new governance values. See https://defiexplore.com/liquidation/4813. The crazier part is that we haven\u2019t seen the end of this if there is another leg down for ETH. Its going to be a long way back for the project if there is one regardless of whether CDP losses are compensated or not.  ",

Oracle price at liquidation Market price at liquidation Keeper bid amount on liquidation Dai debt at liquidation Total collateral recovered per event Total collateral lost per event All the above need to be easily verifiable on-chain  ",

Or it may turn out to be more than we expected after the vote such that we can\u2019t do it without crashing the price of MKR (I think this is very unlikely and there is the option to spread it over a greater time period if this is the case, but still).

I certainly didn\u2019t sign up for this. Other projects have already created the good habit of funding unintended losses their users occurred with their own war chests and the Maker Foundation has one of the biggest war chests in the space.

From what i have been reading there is a fair amount of vault owners who lost considerable amounts of money, if we the users have lost faith how on earth do you expect further adoption. I think its in Makers best interest in resolving this issue and compensating all the vault owners. Im baffled as to why there is even a discussion about this?

What is the point of further securing the system if the main function of the system doesn\u2019t work and you\u2019ve lost a whole community of early users who you risk losing to another platform (Kava for example). This is an excellent opportunity for Maker to show its strengths. Get it right, compensate your users as a priority, get us back on board and show the real strength of a decentralised system, instead of fobbing us of with if\u2019s and maybe\u2019s and in a few week\u2019s etc etc. The Maker community or Foundation (whoever it is) needs to act now!

Why is there a discussion on whether or not to compensate users? Shouldn\u2019t the discussion be, how to compensate as opposed to whether or not?   Because ultimately in order for compensation to happen, it needs to pass an on-chain vote. If we assume everyone is agreed that we should compensate the affected vaults and it turns out MKR Holders think differently, the on-chain won\u2019t pass and it won\u2019t happen. Despite your thoughts on the matter, there is an argument to be made that Vault users should not be compensated. To be clear, I don\u2019t hold this position, but I imagine those that do would present the following arguments:  This is crypto, all the information as to how the liquidations took place is available on-chain in the form of smart-contract code, due to this, you had the opportunity to be fully informed as to how it works, the fact that you were not is your mistake, not ours. The keeper bot code is open-source, as is the contract code. You were able to learn how to run a keeper in order to liquidate your own vault at a favourable rate. The fact that you didn\u2019t is your mistake, not ours. You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you? It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours. In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you. By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.  Put simply, the \u2018answer\u2019 isn\u2019t as obvious as it appears to the users who have been affected. ",

I apologize for the poor formatting in advance. Have a limit on messages I can post at the moment. Argument 1: This is crypto, all the information as to how the liquidations took place is available on-chain in the form of smart-contract code, due to this, you had the opportunity to be fully informed as to how it works, the fact that you were not is your mistake, not ours. Response 1: If we want Maker to make the jump from \u201cexperimental crypto project\u201d to \u201cmainstream finance product\u201d is this really how we want vaults to be advertised? If that is the intention, I do not have an argument against it. Argument 2: The keeper bot code is open-source, as is the contract code. You were able to learn how to run a keeper in order to liquidate your own vault at a favourable rate. The fact that you didn\u2019t is your mistake, not ours. Response 2: Same as above. Do we really want to target a niche crowd of users who can code and alienate everyone else? Argument 3: You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you? Response 3: User also agreed to terms of 13% liquidation (falsely or not) with the protocol (see Oasis UI). Argument 4: It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours. Response 4: See Response 1. Definitely not what I expect to hear from the community. Argument 5: In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you. Response 5: I do not think anyone is complaining that liquidation was triggered incorrectly. I agree the users can (does not mean they will) react better during congestion and it is on them to understand how to use the network if they want to avoid liquidations. Argument 5: By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol. Response 5: Not necessarily. I see parallels to the DAO fiasco where the funds at risk threatened the network. Did not mean users were bailed out during the Parity multisig wallet fiasco. It also allows the opportunity to address the keeper auctions, other sub optimally operating modules and think about other ways of handling potential user losses in the future which in my opinion is required.

You are right, however I don\u2019t think the UI makes any attempt to communicate the very high risk (in its current format) of discounted collateral auctions at all. This risk may not go away until Eth2.0 and mass adoption is here with ETH demand high. Only then can you be certain that auctions will be fiercely competed for. Until then this risk needs to be mitigated somehow. ",

While Maker cant force any external organization to do anything, the DAO could quite easily come up with specific language (and or data/graphs) that clearly explain the possible results of liquidation.

We also communicate with other organizations that provide interfaces to vaults, perhaps like this: \u201cHey, we are working on actively informing users on the risks of the protocol with the most clear/accurate information possible. Here is the vital information we believe users need to understand share whatever we come up with. We would appreciate if you could help this effort by making this information apparent to users\u201d I don\u2019t see why there should be pushback, maybe some interfaces will ignore us, but then the onus is on them when something goes wrong and they refused to communicate the risks clearly. This is something that should of been done a long time ago. \u201cscientific governance\u201d should be obsessed with communicating all known possible/observed scenarios to users.

If volatility in the liquidation protocol is above a certain threshold (e.g. liquidation price goes way below market price) liquidation process should be suspended and (as also suggested by others above) liquidation should be diverted to a programmable DEX (e.g. Uniswap or Loopring). With Chainlink oracles and high throghput DEXes around this seems possible to me (although not a developer). ",

I hope someone better informed can confirm this - Wasn\u2019t the unbacked debt due to 0 bids + all the other bids>0 that did not cover the debt? In the case of non-0 bids, It is possible depending on the bid price the vault holders have \u201ceaten\u201d greater losses than Maker holders.

I will be waiting for third party verification/audit after this recent event before I even consider another CDP and I personally know some devs who will no longer be implementing DAI into their product after having their vaults liquidated and the poor responses received in communiques. I wasn\u2019t even worried at first due to the nature of the exploit and the obvious oversight/failure to implement the system properly. I expected a very proactive response from DAO to ensure that we would be paid back even if it was a slow and measured method. The knee-jerk reaction to blame CDP holders and try to protect the value of the MKR token by some members was disappointing and really highlighted to me how we got here. If their only incentive is just to pump MKR the DAO will never proactively look out it\u2019s users. I\u2019ve heard some strong voices in the community call for changes and hope that the system proves me wrong and does become more proactive but we will have to wait and see. I don\u2019t see any systemically proactive changes in governance votes yet but this is a recent event. ",

Luckily I am running a Dashboard for auctions (maker-auctions.io) since about a week and have just implemented the history feature. I have compiled all data I have for collateral auctions into csv files and uploaded them here: https://maker-auctions.io/auctions_data/auctions_data.zip Update on 09. April 19:10 UTC: About 20 auctions were missing from the ETH history. It has been updated and is now complete. There are two seperate files for ETH and BAT each. The _raw.csv contains raw, unformatted data from the chain. Unless you want to parse it yourself you do not need to use this one. The \u201cnormal\u201d .csv contains the following fields:  Auction ID: The ID of the auction. Does not correspond to CDP ID Liq. User (Proxy): The user whose collateral is sold in the auction. This address will usually not correspond to your personal wallet address - if you are looking for your address you probably won\u2019t find it. The reason therefore is that by using a GUI (like Oasis) a proxy contract is deployed for you which actually owns the CDP and has its own address: You own the proxy which in turn owns the CDP. Col. Amount: The initial amount of available collateral Highest Bid: The highest DAI bid Max. Bid: The maximum possible DAI bid. If highest bid = max bid the second phase has been reached Col. Bought: The collateral the winner of the auction received. The difference between col. amount and col. bought is returned to the liquidated user. Winner: The winner of the auction End: The date when the auction ended  I hope this dataset will be of value for you and bring this discussion forward. Let me know if you have further questions! ",

I now have two different full data sets with all liquidation data as well as the subsection of this data analyzed by whiter4bbit to look at that will all need to be cross checked for consistency. I have not heard of anyone else working on presenting a formal report to the community on this issue.  If there is I would like to hear from them. Expect some news to be forthcoming regarding my independent analysis of ALL MCD vault liquidations over entire life of the MCD including the Black Thursday 0-bid and other vault holders that submitted their vaults and stories for analysis here. Thank you for being patient with me on this.  I am but one lone person with family, full time job (still), and limited free time in my days.   I work for this community purely by my own volition (no renumeration) so my time is necessairly limited but I have felt since day one of this event it was important to consider what happened to the entire community here as a risk event, as well as a real loss event, not just to Maker but to Vault holders, and by proxy as a risk event to DAI holders.
