The vaults debt at risk when you are on a specific vault type (ETH-B), shows how much dai debt would be liquidated if price drops to some point (assuming instant price change) for this specific vault type. Total debt liquidated is a sum between these three categories (low, med, high), the 3M in your case comes from low risk, because your mouse is on this portion of the chart. Under the Risk tab, we have the same metric which includes all vaults. ",
