( Uniswap converts any Token into ETH Automatically). 5: 10 people bought 30 ETH worth of \u201cXYZ\u201d from Uniswap and no one from them adds XYZ token and ETH to XYZ/ETH pool on uniswap that you created. So it means that you have 130 ETH now and 700000 XYZ. ( XYZ Token isn\u2019t listed anywhere else so its value is Zero ). 6:  You Pulled the trigger and removes All of that 130 ETH and 700000 yours XYZ Tokens from Uniswap.

I used the funds in both farming and some for trading. Something didnt make sense to me, and i too received an email making it seem as the project i was working with / for was a rug. This is most likely because MOD\u2019s on telegram are asked too give out Material too new people coming in, Any Tom , Dick or Harry can make a nice looking employment contract. I clicked 2 days later when I remembered the ( fake rug ) was for USDC - Not for the project i was working for or trying too help. Pretty stupid too be honest, If the plan was too get me away from working for the project for a few days too cause doubt in my ability as a MOD and a crypto lover, Simple, Blockchain doesn\u2019t lie. I hope you are all well. Strength too you all. This issue need to be addressed - As well as people sending art / nfts too each others wallet address without the stores consent, I can make a nasty piece or art / material and send it too anyones eth wallet, which forces the receiver too waste time burning it / sending it elsewhere / or leaving it in the store. All not good results, I hope this makes sense. I planned for this as well as I could : https://app.rarible.com/digitalassets?tab=collectibles The story lies with ADAM & EVE - This is the assumption I have, as for some reason when ever I make some crypto, I have to give it away. Apparently this is a common thing in the crypto world and man, does it whip a brain back and forth. Again power too you all, Dev work needs to be done and I\u2019d love to help with ideas as always.
