                    "content": "Hi to all the members of the Maker community! In order to deepen our partnership with Maker, we have been working closely with the Strategic Finance Core Unit and the Growth Core Unit to understand how Gemini can contribute to strengthening the Maker ecosystem. We came up with the below proposal and look forward to hearing the community\u2019s feedback! For more context and information on the support of Maker by Gemini our original GUSD PSM proposal can be found here: Proposal: GUSD PSM The Gemini team has always been excited about supporting Maker and Dai in our various products.  Custody: MKR has been supported on Gemini since August 2020, and Dai since April 2020. Trading: MKR trading was supported in September 2020, and Dai in May 2020. Earn: MKR is supported in the Gemini Earn product with 1.26% APY, and Dai with one of the highest rates at 5.31% APY to our users. Nifty Gateway: Nifty Gateway users can use their Gemini exchange account balances to make purchases on NG. This means a Gemini exchange user who has Dai in their wallet can use it to pay on Nifty Gateway, where a conversion from to ETH or USD takes place. Credit Card: Customers are able to select Dai and MKR as their reward to earn instant crypto rewards on the Gemini Credit Card.  Our exchange is also ranked as one of the top 50 Dai holders by balance. Gemini is a New York trust company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. There are no fees to mint or redeem GUSD 1:1 to USD through Gemini and Gemini covers all gas costs to withdraw on-chain. Gemini dollar (GUSD) USD reserve audits are published monthly by an independent registered accounting firm, BPM LLP, and the Ethereum smart contract was launched in September 2018 and has been audited by Trail of Bits. This information has also been mentioned in our previous Vault collateral application on this forum here, activated shortly after. GUSD-ETH and GUSD-BTC pairs are also available on Gemini.  MakerDAO <> Gemini Marketing Incentive We\u2019d would like to encourage the use of GUSD in the MakerDAO ecosystem and we are excited to announce a marketing incentive:  Starting on 01-Oct-2022, for the next 3 months, Gemini will contribute to MakerDAO a fixed rate of 1.25% (annualized rate, calculated and paid on a monthly basis) for any GUSD present in the PSM, as long as the average monthly balance on the last day of the month is over $100m GUSD  There is a Dune query available that shows the current month-to-date balance for community members to check and do their own calculations:        The payments will be credited once per month in GUSD  As we\u2019d like GUSD usage to increase on-chain, we propose that this marketing incentive only be credited if the average monthly balance of GUSD in the PSM is greater than or equal to $100m for the month Maker will have to onboard and KYC an entity to create an account with Gemini that can be credited, and that can then move the GUSD back to the protocol as instructed by Maker Governance   The GUSD in the PSM will not go into Gemini custody or move from the PSM  We recognize the importance of the PSM in securing Dai redemptions and we believe keeping it on-chain is the best way to fulfill that task   Before the end of December, when we review the results of this experiment, we might renew our commitment at this rate, a different rate altogether or not at all  We hope this proposal is as exciting to the community as it is to us, and we look forward to hearing any comments around this partnership.

                    "content": "So thrilled to see this proposal hit the forums. Thank you to the Gemini team for their engagement and demonstrable track-record of whole-hearted commitment to the space. For the level of liquidity that a GUSD PSM leaves for Dai redemptions, Gemini is offering a very compelling incentive to hold as much of the PSM in GUSD as we can. The GUSD in effect do not leave the PSM at all, at any point, unless Dai holders want to redeem their Dai for them. This proposal is pushing the edge of the pareto optimal frontier for liquidity and yield at the moment. As governance decides on what Dai\u2019s optimal asset allocation should be, we are starting to see the engagement of committed partners who value being closely integrated with MakerDAO and with DeFi as a whole. Governance should evaluate bids for allocation on the merits of the immediacy of the liquidity they offer against the yield provided. GUSD\u2019s partnership offer more than meets the mark for Dai today. Going forward, we should favor PSM vaults with at least a corresponding level of commitment to the MakerDAO ecosystem, and strongly disfavor vaults that do not meet our objectives.  image2310\u00d71148 369 KB  ",

This is the way that all PSM pairs should be onboarded going forward. The PSM benefits DAI by maintaining its peg close to $1.00 but it also greatly benefits the collateral (BUSD) by creating stability for them to continue to grow and earn revenue from their collateral, which we should be compensated for (i.e. 1.25% rewards).

                    "content": "Very interesting proposal @tylerwinklevoss!  Overall, I\u2019m in favour and this is a superior proposal that aligns better with Maker and the End Game plan than nearly everything else to date. Since Paxos and Gemini are the two best regulated stablecoin issuers today due to their deposit taking trust structure (at least from the regulator\u2019s and most lawyers/scholars perspective). Because a deposit taking trust is a regulated financial institution that is closer in structure and regulatory requirements to a bank or credit union, as compared to Circle only having a money transmitter designation, this makes GUSD more akin to an on-chain deposit receipt. The difference in legal structure of the issuer is not to be understated. Deposit receipts entitle holders to a different set of claims in the event of bankruptcy of the financial institution and are also more familiar to regulators and bankruptcy court for the kind of activity that stablecoin issuers undertake. This should reduce regulatory risk to DAI and Maker in comparison to USDC. Additionally, Gemini has one of the better insurance legal structures (not necessarily converage) with their captive set up in Bermuda (major re-insurance market). AFAIK they are the only crypto institution to successfully create a captive to date, and the captive registration and monitoring is regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which is the same regulator that oversees Circle\u2019s USDC Yield product (but not Circle\u2019s issuance). From a custody perspective, this is also much better structured since the GUSD is in Maker\u2019s existing PSM.  Note: because Gemini is the issuer of GUSD, there is no need for them to custody the GUSD because they hold the backing USD fiat anyway. In effect, this reduces middlemen to Gemini and their banking partners as opposed to the Bank \u2192 Circle \u2192 Coinbase \u2192 Maker flow for the USDC that is proposed in MIP81.  On these merits, it is objectively a better proposal. An evaluation of the financial position of the major counterparties involved in these stablecoin deals may be prudent in having a better apples to apples comparison on bankruptcy/default risk.     BlockEnthusiast:  Why can\u2019t you just send the funds to Maker? This whole proposal is quite good, but requiring Maker to make a legal entity to receive funds feels unnecessary.   Agreed. More on that below.     Spidomo:  This suggests you believe this proposal would increase overall centralized stablecoin deposits into PSMs. Why would it? It doesn\u2019t incentivize anyone in that direction. What it does do is incentivize MakerDAO to shift some centralized stablecoin exposure from USDC to GUSD, to earn income. That would have the effect of diversifying centralized stablecoin risk, which I presume you\u2019d agree is not a step in the wrong direction.   Agreed. There is a big de-risking win if the PSMs are better balanced between GUSD and USDC.     lyt:  Not really a good analogy anyway though because of how simple the \u201cproduct\u201d is. We are hopeful that with the slight tinkering of a few parameters , we can get this PSM filled (& others would do the work of swapping USDC for USD for GUSD). If this doesn\u2019t work, there are other ways to get the simple job (USDC \u2192 USD \u2192 GUSD) done.   There are 2 options here:   Onboard an entity to represent Maker as currently proposed and have it swap USDC \u2192 USD via Circle and take the USD to Gemini to mint GUSD and put it in the GUSD PSM. No issues with slippage and minimal fees.   Maker creates a revenue sharing incentive structure such that it passes on a portion of the 1.2% marketing incentive rewards for PSM depositors and/or MKR holders. The market will likely naturally rebalance to acquire more GUSD and put it in the PSM. A little more difficult to be confident on this given the rev share might not be worth the effort to open market participants.    Further Questions @tylerwinklevoss it would be great if you could provide more clarity on:   What would happen to GUSD held by Maker in its PSM in the event that Gemini and/or its financial institutions became delinquent. Are the funds that back GUSD isolated and held in trust in FBO accounts based on named beneficiaries or are they pooled? ie. who would be the claimant on the USD backing the GUSD?   Is there any insurance coverage (FDIC or through your captive) on the USD backing GUSD? In your post here it says funds are FDIC insured, so I assume the legal entity representing Maker would qualify for $250k USD coverage. Can you confirm? If so, is the FDIC coverage on all minted GUSD (~$300MM today) or only the GUSD held by Maker? This goes along with #1, as the account structure matters. Something that FTX recently screwed up.      Proposal: GUSD PSM   Gemini dollar (GUSD)  bank reserves are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per user while custodied with State Street Bank and Trust.    Is it possible for Gemini to send the marketing incentive directly to the PSM address without needing to onboard a representative company and have any manual intervention? Much like I described in MIP81 and what @BlockEnthusiast mentioned, this would reduce centralization and likely also reduce regulatory, legal and operational risk for both Maker and Gemini because you\u2019d simply be paying or airdropping GUSD to a smart contract on a decentralized network and not explicitly paying any legal entity or individual.  Looking forward to seeing this develop!   ",

                    "content": "Dear Maker Community, Some recent questions have emerged following our announcement that we would be pausing withdrawals from the Gemini Earn program. We are disappointed that the Earn SLA will not be met, but wanted to reassure the Maker community that GUSD is unaffected and we will continue our commitment to our partnership with Maker as previously announced.  What is the extent of Gemini\u2019s total exposure to the FTX fallout, or Genesis Lending pausing withdrawals?  Per our blog last week, Gemini has no exposure to FTT tokens or Alameda and no material exposure to FTX. Gemini Earn, which is the only Gemini product integrated with Genesis Lending, has paused withdrawals as a direct result of Genesis\u2019 recent announcement.   Are Gemini user funds affected?  No, Gemini user funds outside of Gemini Earn are unaffected.   Are GUSD reserves affected?  No.   Are GUSD funds segregated from the rest of the business?  Yes. Each GUSD is backed by a U.S. dollar held by Gemini as one of the following types of assets: (1) deposits in U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured banks, (2) money market funds, invested only in U.S. Treasury Obligations, or (3) U.S. Treasury Obligations. The accounts holding GUSD reserves are separate from our business, operating, and reserve accounts.   What banks or institutions do you deposit GUSD reserves in?  The U.S. dollar cash portion of these GUSD reserves may be held at Signature Bank, State Street Bank and Trust Company, or Silvergate Bank. The money market and investment accounts used to invest in U.S. Treasuries are established at Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.   Do you have plans to introduce a proof of reserves or on chain asset attestation?  We do attestations to validate that our total reserve account balances are sufficient to back the on-chain GUSD balance at least monthly. As a whole, it appears that the Gemini community likes the idea of introducing proof of reserves and we have been thinking about how to provide even more transparency. However, per our blog, Gemini is a full-reserve exchange and custodian. This means that all customer funds held by Gemini are held 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time. Gemini holds customer fiat currency in accounts that are segregated from our business, operating, and reserve bank accounts established specifically for the benefit of Gemini customers. We do not do anything with customer fiat funds unless explicitly authorized and directed to do so. Gemini also holds customer digital assets in accounts that are segregated from Gemini\u2019s company assets. We do not do anything with customer digital assets unless explicitly authorized and directed to do so. In addition to being a full-reserve platform, Gemini Trust Company, LLC is a fiduciary and qualified custodian under New York Banking Law and is licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). NYDFS imposes certain excess capital requirements and compliance standards for all assets held by Gemini. At any given time, Gemini is required to hold capital in excess of customer deposits and must report any material changes in meeting this capital requirement to its regulator.    We are huge supporters of Maker and this community, and look forward to continued partnership and growth of the ecosystem. Marshall Beard Chief Strategy Officer Gemini ",

The question is whether MakerDAO can have standing to be a claimant in a bankruptcy proceeding. How can MakerDAO participate in any recovery when it is not a legal person and cannot open a bank account to get paid? Off the cuff I would assume all assets of a bankrupt estate in a U.S. proceeding would be converted to U.S. dollars and paid out accordingly to those creditors whose claims have been reviewed and approved by the court. MakerDAO the unincorporated organization likely cannot be represented in court without some specific and novel governance action that a judge would have to accept. So, the thing for everyone to understand as far as bankruptcy goes\u2026if it happens to a counterparty holding MakerDAO assets it is quite possible that none of the assets subject to an automatic stay have a mechanism to come back to the organization. Contracts or agreements the community may have in place among various legal entities to affect RWA deals and agreements with CeFi may be UNENFORCEABLE by MakerDAO/MKR holders in the event a counterparty to any of those agreements files for bankruptcy. It would certainly be in the interest of the debtor estate to argue that is the case. For internal risk management and planning purposes (regardless of what contracts say), if assets are not in a smart contract that Maker governance controls, those assets should be considered a total loss at the time of the relevant party\u2019s bankruptcy filing. This is not legal advice. I am not a restructuring attorney. This is just some common sense informed by 2 plus decades front row seat TradFi legal career including LTCM, ENRON, AMARANTH Amaranth Advisors - Wikipedia, LEHMAN (where I was in-house counsel in 2008). Too much push back here when wisdom and experience tries to speak about things to take seriously and plan for. But really, it is an issue of MakerDAO focusing on legal & compliance risk overall, providing resources and otherwise signaling via an on-chain vote to guide CUs in making these kind of preparations a priority. ~ Kianga ",

I believe with such little gusd demand from other parties, this gusd psm has actually become illiquid and dependent on Gemini liquidating their treasury positions, hopefully not at a loss.  I\u2019d rather throw this pile of money in our own treasury operations where we have better visibility and control.  I think this debt ceiling should be slowly reduced.  Give Gemini time to come up with the money now\u2026but don\u2019t get caught in a scenario where you need these psm funds quickly or where they are tempted to use these funds to address other debt issues (I truly hope we can trust this won\u2019t happen).

I\u2019ve reviewed the onchain activity, and it paints another picture. (Please correct me if I\u2019ve misinterpreted your statement)  One wallet was responsible for adding 460M GUSD to the PSM. You can track it here: (https://etherscan.io/address/0x66e96e3784343d07147ffbe13bba1a8371dde623)  Their wallet transaction history shows the following:   460M GUSD was withdrawn from Gemini exchange, in average transactions sizes of $15M GUSD.

I would guess the wallet belongs to Gemini and it\u2019s how they basically took a low interest 1.2% loan from the MKR usdc psm (which is better than the 0% we were getting there). Basically, they supply magically created gusd in exchange for DAI which can be exchanged into fiat.  Why do this?  Because they can get 4% on treasuries and pocket the difference in rates.  Which is why I suggest just throwing this into our Monetalis operations instead.  You might call this diversification, but with no demand, I don\u2019t see how it can be considered anything other than an extremely expensive route for treasury yields through the Gemini asset management team.

Our goal is to establish a due diligence process for the allocation of these funds working with Maker and the PSM. We are open to working with Maker to find the best path towards achieving that diligence and are aligned in finding an approach that improves decentralization while staying compliant.\u201d Now an unknown market maker / wallet has supplied 460M GUSD to the PSM, withdrawn DAI, converted that to USDC, moved the USDC to 3 new wallets, and redeeemed the majority of USDC for fiat USD via circle. In light of the Gemini Earn freezing withdrawals, its imperative that MakerDAO understand the source of the GUSD in the PSM, as this now makes MakerDAO the largest holder of GUSDm with over 80% of the GUSD supply in the PSM.

If it turns out that\u2019s not true, then we\u2019re probably screwed (depending on the details.)  (This shouldn\u2019t really be news to anyone. The GUSD is backing DAI, if the GUSD is worthless then it impacts Maker and DAI Holders.) Like, you\u2019re writing about this flow of funds:  USD - > GUSD - > DAI \u2192 USDC - > back to USD and repeat  As if it\u2019s some smoking gun that proves something nefarious. Whereas it\u2019s exactly what everyone expected to happen, as it\u2019s the logical path for Gemini or their agents to fill the GUSD PSM. Which was the whole point of the deal in the first place. Maker gets yield on PSM DAI, Gemini gets the difference between Maker\u2019s yield and whatever they can safely get from the traditional banking system. Is all this a good idea? Depends on whether GUSD is worthless or not. (And on the more general point as to whether centralized stables are safe for Maker to hold in general.) Edit: Ak, reading through that twitter thread, people have already told you this, you\u2019re just not listening, and are confused on the details. So eh. TL;DR: PSM is 100% not 101% collateralized. The 101% you\u2019re referencing is referring to GUSD-A, which is a separate (and now closed) vault. The only cost to filling the PSM are the transaction fees, but I consider it highly likely that Gemini are paying a market maker to do it, as there is no direct profit incentive. But again, this was more or less what we expected, and it really doesn\u2019t matter either way how it gets full. The risk is the same. ",

If this is true, that should concern everyone as to why one of the most regulated and trusted centralized providers of market infrastructure comes to MakerDAO to finance their business operation OR to decide they are doing proprietary trading with magic money to generate income. Where have we SEEN this recently? Are there any downstream problems we might further be able to anticipate? If GUSD implodes, would that be a problem for MakerDAO and the holders of DAI?

We don\u2019t want bad faith accusations from badly informed positions, that\u2019s more or less the definition of trolling.

There\u2019s other points I kind of want to address in your post, but eh, this is already long and it\u2019s arguably off-topic. If you want to have a more thorough debate about the more general responsibility of MKR Holders and core unit folks to DAI holders, it should maybe happen elsewhere.

Cryptohippo65:  The identity of the unknown wallet who supplied over 90% of the GUSD to the PSM is important in the bigger picture   This is incorrect, at least from the perspective of the protocol and DAI users. The reason it\u2019s unimportant is that this risk came into existence the moment (technically 48 hours after the moment) that MKR Holders voted to increase the maximum debt ceiling of the GUSD PSM, at that point, Maker was immediately exposed to GUSD insolvency even before any GUSD entered the PSM. The reason for this is that Maker has a 48 hour delay before it is able to set the debt ceiling to zero. If in a hypothetical, Maker held no GUSD in the PSM, and GUSD was declared insolvent, the PSM would fill over those 48 hours as users traded the insolvent GUSD for (initially) solvent DAI.     Cryptohippo65:  I didn\u2019t think it would be this difficult to get an answer about a simple question.   Respectfully, I think you\u2019ve got an answer, and don\u2019t like it. I think multiple people have now essentially expressed the same answer to you: \u201cWe don\u2019t know, and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Additionally, when pushed people have added: \u201cIt\u2019s more than likely Gemini, or one of their agents, because they have the largest incentive.\u201d Maker-as-a-DAO had nothing to do with it, we would have had to transfer funds to a market maker via vote, which provably hasn\u2019t occurred. Someone within Maker might have contracted a market maker privately to make the transactions, but they would have had to either:  Pay out of pocket (they wouldn\u2019t directly receive any benefit. So seems unlikely.) Pay using a budget granted by the DAO (this one is possible, I\u2019d like to think the CU in question would have mentioned it if that was the case, but eh, maybe not.)  Of the two entities that directly benefit from the PSM being full (Maker and Gemini):  Maker-as-a-DAO provably hasn\u2019t done it (transfers of value out of the DAO are voted on and are visible onchain.) Leaving Gemini.  But again, and I can\u2019t stress this enough. It really, really doesn\u2019t matter to DAI holders who filled it up, or whether it\u2019s even full. It only matters that it\u2019s available to be filled. ",

There\u2019s no way to definitively know exactly what\u2019s going on but at least there\u2019s an understanding of what we suspect and thereby what that suspicion implies in terms of the risk we face. When this deal was announced, gusd\u2019s supply was a bit north of 300 million.  It had been growing slowly and seemed to have an upward trajectory.  As the MKR gusd psm debt ceiling grew, you can see gusd\u2019s supply growing accordingly until it reaches somewhere north of 800 million.  The correlation here is pretty evident.  On November 16, Gemini suspended withdrawals from its Gemini earn program.  Gusd supply drops about 200 million over the next few days leaving MKR\u2019s psm holding a large percentage of what remains.  Obviously there was a huge reputational hit and loss in trust and many gusd holders traded in their gusd for something they trusted more. What bothers me is that MKR hasn\u2019t repriced this deal after the Gemini earn suspension.  The debt ceiling hasn\u2019t been reduced and the rate has not been renegotiated.  Granted, it hasn\u2019t been that long.  But there just wasn\u2019t much discussion (at least publicly).  I won\u2019t argue for completely terminating the partnership but I think based on recent events, the debt ceiling should be significantly reduced and the rate renegotiated.  I truly hope Gemini can recover and rebuild their reputation.  I understand that would be better for everyone.  However, to me, the suspension of Gemini earn means they don\u2019t have a big enough buffer of liquid assets to comfortably cover a large withdrawal event and that makes me extremely uncomfortable with how big the gusd psm is.

If you tell me you want to draw down the USDC PSM\u2019s debt ceiling at any point in time, I feel confident I can go and get a 1 dollar USDC value from others who are willing to hold USDC.  I feel confident because I know there\u2019s 40 billion out there held by many others who trust Circle more than Paxos or Gemini.  You are right USDP is not much better but at least there\u2019s some money out there backing it that doesn\u2019t come from MKR.  At this point with GUSD, you\u2019re basically dependent on going to Gemini directly for your money when you need or want it. At the end of the day, the question is how much you continue to trust Gemini.  But whether you do or not, you do have to acknowledge that 200 million out of the 300 million non MKR sourced backing behind GUSD disappeared after the Nov 16.  That happened because those who were behind that money decided there was a better place to put their money and it was seemingly triggered by this announcement.  To me, that\u2019s the market telling you there is increased risk to this holding.  You are right that if Gemini is true to their word and those GUSD reserves held in treasuries and banks, are kept separate, everything should be fine.  The question is if other areas of Gemini are insolvent, would these reserves be needed to cover other liabilities.  Anyway, even if we decide to help them out and keep the debt ceiling high, shouldn\u2019t we get a little bit more than 1.2% when treasury rates are so high?  Once Coinbase starts giving MKR yield on USDC, this question will become even more relevant. ",

Some ppl have insinuated there is a link but there is no evidence to support this, and in fact it has always been made crystal clear in Gemini ToS that Earn program was linked to Genesis and faced risk related to their lending activities. People are understandably shook up after FTX turned out to be a fraud but I don\u2019t think there is any evidence to suggest Gemini has similar operational lapses (vs ample evidence of impropriety from FTX, such as web offshore registrations, wire/bank transfers routing through Alameda, well established conflicts of interest between FTX exchange and Alameda market making service, SBF generally being an extremely sus character, etc). Who filled up GUSD PSM is a non-sequitur. We can safely assume it was someone related to Gemini because they have financial incentives to increase GUSD in circulation due to interest rate spread. But from a risk perspective I don\u2019t think it matters. I think GUSD still provides significant benefits vs routing all of our capital into Monetalis tbill strategies. Gemini has a long history of honoring all requested USD redemptions promptly, whereas Monetalis has essentially no track record at all, having never faced redemption demands so they have never had opportunity to prove they can honor the same. Further, while a majority of GUSD is held currently by Maker\u2019s PSM, there are significant and diverse coinvestors, which offers a high degree of protection versus centralization risk factors. And a final point, GUSD\u2019s effective duration is very short (conceivably it should be possible to redeem 100s of millions of GUSD within days), where Monetalis redemptions could take considerably longer due to operational processes. If DAI faced a significant demand deficit, GUSD could help provide immediate support to the peg, while Monetalis allocations would probably only help after weeks or months. I\u2019d like to see Gemini offer a higher revenue share over time, but I think at present the risk/reward for allocating to GUSD still makes sense given available alternatives. ",

One point that I think that would be interesting to explore is the level of severity that is being given to the counterparty risk associated with Gemini. To begin with, this counterparty risk would apply to any business that provides funds to MakerDAO, and the points I\u2019m about to make a solely to benefit MakerDAO, and is not a comment on Gemini\u2019s reputation, which I have no reason to doubt. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk is a legitimate risk in any business transaction. Members have stated that they trust Gemini, and therefore consider this risk low. Members also acknowledge that if Gemini weren\u2019t able to meet their redemption obligations, then MakerDAO would stand to lose $500 million. Given the large sum of money involved, it would be massively beneficial if MakerDAO were able to quantify the level of counterparty risk. I would like to put forward, that MakerDAO is in a strong position to determine this. Actionable solutions Members consider the Gemini\u2019s counterparty risk low, so for discussion sake, let\u2019s say the risk of Gemini being unable to honour GUSD redemptions at 1%. Scenario 1: continue with the current GUSD PSM agreement, but ask for more interest. MakerDAO will receive more profit, but the counterparty risk remains the same. Outcome: A few percentage profit gains, with a 1% counterparty risk of losing 100% of the $500M. (were Gemini not be able to meet their redemptions, due to a blackswan event) Scenario 2: Redeem the 500M GUSD when the GUSD duration ends, and increase the GUSD PSM limit to 1 Billion if all redemptions are met. \u201cGemini has a long history of honoring all requested USD redemptions promptly\u201d. This is true in relation to past redemptions for smaller smaller amounts, and at a much lower marketcap. The MakerDAO PSM contains over 80% of the GUSD supply, and this level or redemption has never been tested, which presents a new level of risk. Past redemptions are a good indication, but do not provide sufficient info to determine the risk of redemptions of such a large scale. Since this has never been tested, the counterparty risk is truly unknown. MakerDAO can actually benefit from this tremendously. MakerDAO could negiotate with Gemini to actually increase the amount of GUSD in the PSM, to earn even more interest. But before increasing the limit, MakerDAO would like to consolidate its position given the current liquidity crisis spreading throughout the crypto market. The contagion in the crypto market is still spreading, and with liquidity drying up, it is reasonable to reassess all partnerships and protect MakerDAO\u2019s capital reserves. If Gemini can redeem all the GUSD, MakerDAO has just confirmed that Gemini can meet their redemption obligations at any level. Benefit 1: MakerDAO has now reduced their counterparty risk to negligible. Benefit 2: Increase the GUSD PSM to 1 billion, and earn even more interest. If Gemini can\u2019t redeem the GUSD, MakerDAO will need to revise their risk management analysis for future projects. From a purely business standpoint, this is a win-win for MakerDAO. This confirms MakerDAO\u2019s level of risk. If redemptions are met, MakerDAO can now safely increase its GUSD PSM, and earn even more interest. ",

Not to be pedantic but on the whole it does matter from an AML risk perspective. Especially at that size. If funds were frozen due to AML/CTF or BSA breach it\u2019s a problem. In this particular case, since funds come from Gemini, which is highly reputable and has robust AML policies (I know because I went through them), I do not believe it to be a risk here. This comment is more to inform future discussions around risk.  My personal view is in alignment with most others that are pro-GUSD support here. While there are certainly redemption, concentration and bankruptcy risks here, all things considered, this is still by far the lowest risk RWA deal that Maker has, by a lot! At least GUSD is a proper NYFDS regulated Trust setup (unlike with USDC). It\u2019s very fair to assume redemption of all the GUSD would be fine unless Gemini or the underlying fiat custody banks themselves went bankrupt. I\u2019m glad people are discussing this!

I assume that would just result in an unwinding in reverse order of DAI \u2192 GUSD PSM \u2192 Gemini \u2192 USD, but if the fiat was clawed back (which is what a creditor cares about) and the DAI isn\u2019t burned (for whatever reason) then you end up with DAI being unbacked and since you can\u2019t freeze DAI, that\u2019s a problem. So, it would be good to verify that all the GUSD - USD numbers line up and get confirmation from Gemini that the source of funds for the USD backing the GUSD that went into the PSM is not from credit in any way.

Further to this point, it\u2019s time to raise the level of respect for the United States of America and the people who were here and came here from all over the world during the last half a millennium - willingly and unwillingly. If you have any wealth or status tied to MakerDAO, at this point it rests very much so on the \u201cfull faith and credit of the United States\u201d derived from the blood, sweat and tears of many countless millions. This is an empirical fact due in no small part to the controversial reliance of DAI and the project on USDC since 2020. Add to that the venture capital from United States firms that has flowed to this project since the earliest days. Add to that the other large U.S. based buyers of MKR who continue to sustain everything going on here by holding. What supports all this? At the end of the day is it not the every day people who work and suffer here? We are composed of newcomers and ancestors of the downtrodden and oppressed that many of us in \u201ccrypto\u201d hope to serve by being in this industry. So while it is fashionable to bash the U.S., its law makers and agencies, we have what we have here because of a history that has its points of pride. And no matter our views on its ills and what should change in the future, it is appropriate to take a step back and acknowledge the shoulders we all are standing on. If I am wrong, this project should immediately cancel all partnerships, repurchase MKR tokens, cease cooperation and integration with Coinbase, Gemini, BlockTower, a16z, USDC just for starters. If no, you don\u2019t want to do that? Then it\u2019s time to raise our level of discourse and commitment to engage proactively and constructively with the structure in which we find ourselves.

Transactions between those entities have become a focal point for investigators trying to figure out FTX\u2019s collapse last month. Prosecutors and regulators charged Mr. Bankman-Fried with fraud, saying he used FTX customer funds to fuel Alameda trades and his own lavish lifestyle. Mr. Bankman-Fried has admitted that he directed FTX customers to deposit funds into Alameda bank accounts. He has denied he committed fraud. Republican Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Roger Marshall of Kansas, along with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said an account at Silvergate \u201cappears to be at the center\u201d of the collapse. Monday, Silvergate defended its risk and monitoring systems. It suggested it hadn\u2019t known that money going into Alameda was supposed to be for FTX. \u201cAt Silvergate, we understand and share the concerns being widely expressed that FTX apparently was directing its customers to wire money to Alameda\u2019s accounts,\u201d the bank\u2019s CEO Alan Lane wrote. The letter added a review of the transactions involving accounts associated with FTX and/or Alameda is ongoing. The bank told the senators it couldn\u2019t answer specifics about a single customer or whether it had flagged any regulators concerns about the transfers, citing laws about confidentiality and bank rules. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get too much in the way of real answers,\u201d Sen.

Appreciate the personal time doing it and your team working with MakerDAO to help generate return to Maker via GUSD in the PSM. Now regarding the whole swath of comments regarding liquidity (Maker having almost 85% of all GUSD in the PSM) as of writing and significant questioning here regarding overall risk to Maker. Lets start with some basics. Since the risk assessment team reviewed the 500M GUSD DC raise, and governance approved this Maker was left earning nothing on the risk taken.   This proposal at least generates some revenue against that risk.  Which I think everyone agrees is existential to Maker.  GUSD implodes and Maker ends up with anything remotely close to a $500M hole in the balance sheet.   Going to leave a gaping hole no matter what.   This inherently leaves all remaining DAI ~90% backed by remaining assets btw.   Not great but 90% better than 0 or 10% I think. Debate whether or how here on this $500M could entirely implode but in the final analysis,  risk accepted this passed it on to governance which passed it.   Once that happened as @LongForWisdom writes:     LongForWisdom:  That\u2019s because it really doesn\u2019t matter who is putting the GUSD into the PSM. The risk is identical either way.   The statements in the above reply all absolutely correct.   Lets add the above generous proposal by Gemini at least starts to pay Maker for taking the above risk and that it doesn\u2019t have to pay one $.01 to Maker. I really, REALLY want governance and all stakeholders to wrap their heads around this.   EVERY RWA that connects to DAI via Maker has some element of risk associated with it.   This risk centers on counter parties, and ability to lay claims in any toxic legal situation, not just on assets, but by recognizable plaintiffs, in jurisdictions. Frankly something I think RISK should undertake here given the growing number of RWA existential risks (USDC, Monetalis, GUSD, etc) is to create a chart of risk and return rankings 1-10 that include stuff like \u2018size\u2019, \u2018counter party\u2019, \u2018return\u2019, \u2018backing\u2019, \u2018jurisdiction\u2019, \u2018etc\u2019.   Honestly making some of this up but the point here is that I always saw risk management as part of @Risk-Core-Unit job and perhaps it is time to put them to work ranking the changing risks in Maker particularly around RWA and the evolving DCs. I appreciate people doing research, bringing up issues but from my seat unless someone thinks the PSMs are going to be eliminated (and how would you do this btw) people are crying over already spilt Milk on the PSM front. One thing I want to make clear here with the above deal and PSMs in general.   Maker doesn\u2019t control the fee it gets on this except by tout/tin.  PSMs are simply a swapping mechanism.  Once tokens end up in these there is:  No way to auction the assets other than a spell and governance action and even then I am not sure what it would mean for the protocol No way to act in any reasonable time frame even if Maker needed to other than to shut off the PSM.  Which brings a question - what does emergency response look like on these?   I mean GUSD is basically at peak DC so it doesn\u2019t get much worse here.  But i wonder about stuff with significantly available DC. Since there are no fees there basically is no way to force these assets to move.   The only reason Maker is getting fees is because of the good graces of Gemini.   These could be turned off at a moments notice.  So don\u2019t think this deal is something that is signed, sealed and could be litigated .  It can be changed at a moments notice.    This is in stark contrast to deals with other RWA parties that have real fees in them (debate what this means in practice and how binding they are, but the above offer from Gemini as far as I can tell isn\u2019t a valid contract, but simply a rebate offer retractable/modifiable at any time!  The above is a prime reason to have a fiduciary intermediary here (to establish and have a enforceable contract with real terms) and to head off @ChrisBlec here a bit.   As you and most of us here already know.  Maker has taken and eaten of the forbidden fruit with any RWA.   Sole reason here is that ALL RWA by definition is centralized.   I think @ACREinvest has good points regarding how DAOs by trying to stay \u2018decentralized\u2019 in effect hazard not just centralized/counterparty risks, but it also hazards jurisdictional, and party risks (party in the sense that the who that represents MakerDAO actually is able and willing to represent, and do so in ways aligned with Maker interests in a relevant jurisdiction). The time to fight for Maker/DAI and decentralization has long since passed imo, at this point the job of governance is to do its best job to generate returns for the DAO and to mitigate risk generally.   At this point given the schism not just cognitively but also politically in Maker there is only one party to appeal to generally at this point and that is @rune because for all practical purposes nothing happens on this protocol at this point without his approval.

Coinmakretcap is using mainly EXMO which have $0.13 spread between two GUSD pairs. This is as low quality data feeds as it gets. . Coingecko is using mainly Curve which is actually where real volume is. When both Coinbase, Curve, Uniswap and the PSM are saying GUSD price was $1, then price was $1. If community think Silvergate will default on his bank deposits, despite being rated Prime-2 by Moody\u2019s and being regulated as a bank (which I\u2019m not saying I have much confidence in CRAs or regulators), then it make sense to exit GUSD (if we assume they have exposure), and to a lower extend others stablecoins as well. FDIC insurance is indeed of little use for MakerDAO in my understanding due to our size (and practical implementation by being a DAO and not a person). Writing a MIP is the way. If someone is not happy with holding GUSD, just provide how and where we, as a community, should allocate and let\u2019s discuss on an actionable plan, if any, and not just on some \u201cconcerns\u201d. This would be good governance, this is how a open and decentralized protocol should work. ",

Thus, Gemini depositors are insured by the FDIC up to a limit of $250,000. Gemini, being a centralized exchange, has completed KYC on all of its GUSD holders. Therefore, providing this data to the FDIC should not be difficult. It becomes more complex when GUSD has been traded and is now held in non-KYC wallets. ",

Don\u2019t feel great knowing GUSD has indirect SI exposure. I personally don\u2019t think FDIC insurance is likely to do much good for Maker in the event Silvergate (or another centralized stablecoin counterparty) defaults. However as a federal reserve member bank SI has access to a bunch of liquidity programs that reduce risk of a bank run situation taking them under. I would feel better if Gemini held a greater share of GUSD reserves in ultra-short treasuries, and then just maintained smallish bank balances to cover creation/redemption. That said, the Silvergate fear could be getting a bit overblown, as I haven\u2019t seen any evidence they lost money in the recent turmoil.     Eumenes:  One a separate note, Maker probably has lower risk by keeping most of its PSM stablecoins in the strongest counterparty which is arguably USDC. Diversification only helps if the counterparty risk of a given stable coin isnt large enough to destroy Maker. At this point a counterparty failure of either Circle or Gemini is existential so Maker has existential risk to BOTH Circle and Gemini which is higher existential risk than to Circle alone\u2026   I don\u2019t completely agree. While having several high exposure counterparties gives more chances for Maker to face an existential hit, the losses to DAI holders from any individual counterparty defaulting could be lower. Also think there is strategic benefit to fostering an ecosystem of centralized stablecoins rather than entrenching a single issuer through exclusive use at Maker. Overall, I think Maker\u2019s GUSD exposure still makes sense. We\u2019ve seen Gemini follow through on sharing revenue, and their capacity to meet redemptions has been proven out over the past month. GUSD also offers immediate liquidity to respond to changes in DAI supply/demand, while other RWAs may take much longer to recall funds if needed. Rather than curtailing GUSD exposure, I\u2019d prefer to put constructive pressure on Gemini to reduce their (possibly unsecured) exposure to crypto focused banks like Silvergate and Signature and shift more of their reserves into treasury bills, govt money funds or other government guaranteed assets.

You could literally have asked for any amount, and Gemini would have had zero options but to accept that amount.  Why? Because MakerDAO literally holds 86% of all the GUSD total supply.  An additional 30.5M GUSD should be subtracted, which have been lost to bankruptcies, but still held in wallets by Blockfi, Celsius & Voyager. This brings the real GUSD circulating supply to $540M.  MakerDAO\u2019s PSM true ownership of GUSD is 90.5%.  If this partnership ends, GUSD will be reduced to just a circulating marketcap of 50M!!! It\u2019s already one of the lowest volume coins per marketcap size, and is barely used outside of Gemini. Without MakerDAO, GUSD would likely fade into insignificance after freezing Gemini Earn withdrawals. For better, or for worse:  MakerDAO is now GUSD.  Gemini knows this, but for some reason certain parties on here are still playing dumb on this fact. The second an exchange freezes withdrawals for ANY product on their platform, the trust is gone with its customers. No exchange has ever been able to recover from this fact. My recommendation is to save MakerDAO from the reputational damage, and end this partnership. Alternatively, postpone the partnership until the lawsuits have been resolved. Again, it is a terrible look for MakerDAO to be profiting off a partnership with a business partner that is currently being sued by it\u2019s customers for freezing their Gemini Earn withdrawals, which was being used by customers to earn interest on their GUSD. Is the reputational damage really worth the profit? Failing that, renegiotate the deal. Gemini is floating in the sea, and MakerDAO is holding the only floatation device. ",

But again, the decision to continue the partnership was already decided so it more seems like a statement to placate those with real concerns on here, rather than a good faith discussion to potentially take real risk mitigation action. With regards a technical implementation to manage GUSD exposure, you can\u2019t code your way out of risk. There is $489 million worth of GUSD exposure in the PSM. The only way to reduce that risk, is to reduce MakerDAO\u2019s exposure to GUSD and lower the amount in the PSM. There is no magical blockchain technical implementation that can manage GUSD exposure. You either reduce the GUSD limit in the PSM, or the risk remains the same. Unless members from that call that were discussing this, would like to share an alternative method? ",

The vote was conveniently scheduled so that it would end the EXACT same date that Genesis declared chapter 11 bankruptcy. This information would have had a significant impact on the vote IMO. Although I will respect the decision of the vote, I find this timing incredibly suspicious. It has also come to my attention that just a month before the updated GUSD proposal was suggested, on 15AUG2022 Gemini Earn requested $465M collateral from Genesis. Can you guess the exact amount of GUSD, the entity that Gemini refuses to disclose as the market maker moved through the Maker PSM? $465M!!! Then just 3 days after the $465M moved through Maker and is converted back to fiat, Gemini & Genesis come to a new arrangement to allow Genesis more time to pay back Gemini. These are some strikingly amazing coincidences regarding this deal. There is something incredibly fishy about the the GUSD deal and I will continue to provide information so that MakerDAO can continue to make informed decisions. Due diligence is not a set and forget process. It should be a continuing process to ensure the integrity of a business deal. TD:LR  The GUSD vote was scheduled to end the exact same date that Genesis declared chapter 11, which denied voters crucial information to make a fully informed vote. Gemini requested collateral from Genesis on 15Aug22, and Genesis provided 30.9M GBTC worth $465M at the time. $465M was moved through the GUSD Maker PSM by the market maker wallet that has txns linking it back to Genesis. Just 3 days after the $465M was moved through Maker, Gemini and Genesis come to an updated agreement to allow Genesis more time to pay.
