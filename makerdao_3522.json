Now I see that SAI is pumping hard, even as a stable coin it\u2019s worth now 12.35 USD even though it was meant to be near to 1 USD per SAI. Since the borrowing of SAI wasn\u2019t capped to the relative USD worth but to the number of SAI I now have to pay back 12x the original value of the borrowing? Is that true or is there a work around? I\u2019d be pretty fucked if I\u2019d have to pay that amount back. ",

In Compund it doesn\u2019t matter what asset you requested, for example you can deposit USDT and borrow current DAI, if DAI rises to 1.05 and breaks your collateralization you lose the backing asset. So even though SAI\u2019s target when it was working was 1:1 its price was frozen at the last value in ETH before closing, hence the relatively high price. ",
