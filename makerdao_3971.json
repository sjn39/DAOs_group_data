Back in mid-June the head of Centrifuge said this. Has RWF or anyone else asked @Protocol-Engineering about how to implement this? I know I forgot, so I suspect others did as well.  As you see, regular investors on the Tinlake platform receive 10x what Maker does for its only Tinlake-Associated vault. We\u2019re losing money by not collecting these to then sell for DAI (or even use for governance votes, though I\u2019d prefer we collect the revenue). And we have only ourselves to blame. On our New Silver vault alone, this is an estimated $1.69 million in yearly revenue we are missing out on, and for zero additional cost or risk. We currently collect around $190k on the exact same vault debt. We also have only 3 ilks projected to earn >$1 million/year. We can make that 4 with NS simply by collecting these rewards. This is akin to not bending over to pick up a $100 bill on the sidewalk. How can we get the collection of these rewards online ASAP, given the tens of millions we are soon to provide in liquidity to Tinlake platform? Because this has fallen through the cracks (partly my fault for not following up on it in the last month and a half because I had my day job and other things on my plate), and these are rewards we are entitled to as the largest provider of liquidity, let\u2019s figure out what we need to do to get moving on this. The sun is always shining on MakerDAO, which also means we won\u2019t be caught sleeping in. Let\u2019s push this into an executive as soon as we have a technical solution. ",

The Centrifuge version would be another order of complexity as the token is to be claimed on Polkadot. Even with wCFG (which is assume is safe but didn\u2019t check what is the link with CFG), selling the rewards on the market will probably crash the wCFG price.leading to not much revenues (as you pointed out we get a lot). The easiest solution I see for now is to use a legal structure (like the Cayman Foundation) to hold the DROP token and use it to claim the rewards. Let\u2019s be honest, it will take a few months to get there (then a few months to implement it). Any significant earning might have vanished by then. ",

It is my understanding that Centrifuge (the startup) is treating CFG as securities (which is why they avoid commenting on the price or answering some questions). So Centrifuge Chain (the DAO) can probably issue CFG tokens (taken from where? I guess the rewards are handled by a smart contract, you can start by auditing it and check how it works) for Maker but Centrifuge (the startup) is probably not able to touch them. In DeFi simple stuff are complex. So while the ask for CFG is fully legit, the question is the priority. Strategy vs tactic. RWA ecosystem development versus yield-seeking. ",

On another topic   Maker Protocol Engineering would need to work together with us to modify & redeploy the collateral adapters (MIP21/MIP22) to take proper control of the DROP tokens.   This seems like a great long-term goal for us to control the DROP tokens anyway, so this may be a way to fund that PE time? Happy to hear thoughts from those in PE, as I know they\u2019re always slammed.    On another topic   Unfortunately as there simply isn\u2019t a balance accrued to Maker here it\u2019s also not possible what they would have been if the DROP tokens were held in a contract by Maker.   This was the next stumbling block, but we know the various rates of CFG rewards and the DAI provided ton any given day, so this should be something I or someone else on Maker\u2019s end can estimate manually. For anyone interested, rewards were .0042 CFG/day/DAI from October until on/around June 14 when they went to .002 CFG/day/DAI. From there they were lowered to the current level of .001 CFG/day/DAI on/around June 30. Using even the all-time low price of CFG (.55) as a benchmark, you can see that this amounts to several thousand dollars per day. In the New Silver vault alone, we are entitled to ~$3000 from just today (5438.676 CFG * .55 price). Note that CFG/wCFG trades at a price of .90 at the time of writing. If it turns out that there is a more specific formula than simply CFG per day per DAI, we can, of course, make sure we use the correct one. I will continue to update here, including getting a commitment from Centrifuge\u2019s community to track and eventually deliver the significant rewards from providing liquidity to date. ",

Request the .csv file to see the complete estimate. I will continue to update until we have confirmation from Centrifuge that the estimate is correct and a commitment to deliver rewards at a future date, and discussion on the Centrifuge forum can be found here. Update Aug 4, 2021: With a small drawdown in the NS-DROP vault, today\u2019s estimated CFG/wCFG liquidity rewards earned by Maker are 4950.944 CFG. With additional DROP ilks passing the executive today, Maker\u2019s share of CFG rewards should grow significantly in coming weeks. Rewards not collected today only: -Using the conservative, all-time low price of CFG ($0.55), this is $2723 in rewards (equivalent to ~2.5% of today\u2019s revenue). -Using today\u2019s market price as of writing ($0.97), this is $4802 in rewards (equivalent to ~4.5% of today\u2019s revenue). Rewards not collected in total (awaiting Centrifuge commitment to deliver to Maker): -Using the conservative, all-time low price of CFG ($0.55), this is $289,313.999 in rewards. -Using today\u2019s market price as of writing ($0.97), this is $510,244.688 in rewards.    Update: Did the tally based upon DAI outstanding * daily CFG rewards. Rough estimate is that as of today, Maker has earned 521,000+ CFG tokens. In today\u2019s prices, this is roughly $463,000 of rewards. Using the conservative, all-time-low price of CFG/wCFG, this is roughly $286,000 of rewards. In terms of governance clout, that is halfway to earning Maker 1 seat on Centrifuge\u2019s 7-seat council that governs it. Needless to say, the cash value and governance value are both quite large. What we do with the rewards is not for me to say, but given how much liquidity we are about to deploy to the platform, I could see Maker controlling several seats on their council. Once the current executive passes, Maker will be entitled to a much larger share of rewards. I have not yet heard a response from @spin here or at Centrifuge on that estimate, but am confident they will honor some approximation of it. After all, Maker would not have been purposefully excluded, and any business partner acting in good faith would treat all liquidity providers the same. I will continue to keep the DAO posted as this proceeds. The additional revenue or governance influence would either one be a big asset to Maker. ",

I would like the decentralized Governance ethos/process to stay intact. IMO it\u2019s very important for crypto communities to align themselves via a decentralized governance process\u2014and as a community (Maker) who strives for DAO excellence\u2014we need to let Governance Protocol token holders make these decisions\u2014not co-founders, or individual community members. I like to think that every DeFi protocol has its own community speaking up (for the most part DAO members do)\u2014even if token ownership is currently uneven. Also, should every DeFi protocol that has used DAI for growth also award MakerDAO with protocol Tokens? Should the upcoming Paxos PSM reward MakerDAO with PAX tokens? Should the next LendCo also issue MakerDAO private equity? Are we going to spend tine and chase down every community and ask for retroactive rewards? See this Compound discussion with over 300+ replies in over 6 months And last but not least, MakerDAO and Centrifuge are writing history by introducing RWAs via Decentralized Finance. Let\u2019s stay focus and make this a relevant growth opportunity. Focus on the bigger prize Maker Community. ",

Unfortunately, the early replies have not been encouraging, and @spin has stated that treating Maker\u2019s DAI the same as all other DAI is \u201can unacceptable burden on Centrifuge.\u201d As a delegate, however, I have committed to several MKR holders already to making sure Maker receives fair treatment on this matter. I am confident a solution can be found that brings our protocols closer together, and does not leave Maker as the only party deemed not good enough to earn Centrifuge governance tokens. ",

Most people will interpret that as you assuming you are representing the wish of MakerDAO.  I am, however, here on behalf of some very large MKR holders (more than enough to pass an executive) who feel Maker is being treated unfairly.  Would you be so kind as to start a Signal Request to validate that? And if doesn\u2019t succeed like your previous drama-related signal requests, please stop making MakerDAO looks bad. MakerDAO is there to create the future of finance and not to entertain the DeFi space. You are 100% right to open a discussion to ask for CFG rewards (also I think this is just wasting time). But you tend to generate more chaos than good. This is creating a toxic environment (filled with harassment, baseless accusations, constant misrepresentation of the truth,\u2026). If very large MKR holders are reaching to me saying that hunting for CFG rewards is a priority, let\u2019s so be it. So far I\u2019m hearing the opposite. ",
