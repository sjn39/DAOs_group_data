Here is the notes file, please add questions here https://hackmd.io/T2rPKFKWQDu3kZ8HoHh4Mg or in this thread ahead of the call. Open Collective can potentially be used by distributed teams (and non-organizations like EthMagicians) to collect fiat funds for sponsorships, memberships, or donations, track finances transparently, pay back expenses, and more. This is interesting for open source projects of all kinds, but I\u2019m specifically suggesting that global, decentralized web projects attend this call. It solves some of the issues More on Open Collective  Open Collective enables groups to quickly set up a collective, raise funds and manage them transparently.  From the About page:  Meetups, open source projects, parent associations, neighborhood associations, pet projects, clubs, unions, movements, non-profits, business incubators - in order to operate, all of them are forced to use a physical glass jar, ask a sponsor to directly pay their expenses or front the huge overhead of setting up and managing a corporation or a non-profit. It\u2019s either inefficient and opaque or it\u2019s overkill.  ",

Open Collective \u2013 12 Dec 18    Webinar with Pia, overview of the Open Collective Platform Thanks to @piamancini for walking a group of us through the Open Collective platform. It was super valuable and I really appreciate her taking the time to explain a lot of the platform, the roadmap, and the vision.  Griffin from Colony was there and...      There is a full video that is worth watching. I do think that using OC as a permanent \u201chost organization\u201d for Councils and other meetups would work very well. Crypto is not \u201cnatively\u201d supported, but you can track it and pay back outside the system. Having a collective per Council \u2013 and setting the currency per collective \u2013 may be the way to go. I\u2019m going to explore setting up my company as a \u201chost\u201d projects we\u2019re running. Thanks again @piamancini ",
