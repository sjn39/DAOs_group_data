Today we have ConsolFreight with us. They are going to be presenting the project, telling us how they work, and what they are doing. Then we can go into how this relates to Maker and what are the plans here. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

Could you provide a real world example, maybe a short one that we can go through to give more context for people to ask questions and to clarify what remains unclear? 37:01 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Someone in chat asked if the risk evaluation is done manually. How do you do it? 38:10 - Person: You said that in case of default there\u2019s a way for you to recompensate\u2026 If you get an order from Apple and you\u2019ve got 10,000 iPhones 12 in there and Apple \u2014for some crazy reason\u2014 doesn\u2019t settle the invoice within 45 days, you could auction off those 10,000 iPhones 12 39:38 - Person: So if the invoice is net 45, you don\u2019t deliver the goods until 45 days or before? 40:45 - Person: Do you own the trucks and the ships or are you more like brokers? 41:43 - Akash: At the end of the day it\u2019s a DROP token that\u2019s being deposited into the Maker Protocol, right? What\u2019s the collateralization ratio or expected collateralization ratio? How does liquidation work? And, from an auction keeper side, we\u2019re moving to Auction V2. How does the end buyer of DROP eventually convert back to Dai? So they need to get to real world assets and get back to Dai. How does that process work? What are normal banks charged for this, collateral type? And how is Maker going to be competitive to that rate? How leveraged will the minting of Dai eventually become? 45:29 - Akash: When do things go bad and where is the Maker Protocol at risk? How does the auction mechanism solve that risk? 48:22 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How often is the value of the SPV revaluated and communicated to Maker, if that\u2019s the case? 49:41 - Akash: Is this being currently used by banks as a collateral or it\u2019s just too hard for them? 51:08 - Akash: And what about weird externalities. Let\u2019s say the ship sinks or something like that. Is there additional insurance that covers that kind of situations? What are the natural holes where Maker could be hurt? 52:06 - Akash: What do the ten returns look like? DROP is supposed to be about a 10% return, right? Since it\u2019s a high yield product, what kind of returns are those? 53:03 - Amy Jung: There\u2019s one more question in the chat: How do you prevent scams? For example, getting something worthless as collateral with its risk, and how is it resolved?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 55:08  Thank you, Akash, for the questions. And thank you, Alejandro and Ernesto from ConsolFreight for having joined us. It was really nice having you. Hopefully we helped everyone understanding a little bit more what is happening behind the scenes. Let\u2019s keep the discussion going in the forum  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
