                    "content": "MakerDAO Community, DAI continues to trade in a perilous, dislocated state at $1.02-1.03. We believe this is an existential threat to MakerDAO\u2019s long term success. Given the state of the peg, we believe emergency action is required and would like to gauge the community for feedback. The MIPs process may take 1-2 months to onboard new collateral. Lack of action today is an implicit resignation to another 1-2 months of DAI dislocation, which is catastrophic to the broader Maker community of MKR holders, DAI holders, keepers, market makers, dApp developer teams, and broader DeFi ecosystem. Key Points to Consider: Lack of Monetary Policy Levers: MKR holders have continued to express a dovish stance on rates over the past few weeks with ETH stability fees falling from 8% to 0.5% and USDC stability fees falling to 12%. We believe MKR holders have no more effective monetary policy levers to increase DAI supply given where rates stand. We see a reduction in the USDC stability fee as having a marginal impact, given market participants can already post USDC and borrow DAI at 0.55% on Compound. Eroding Confidence in the Peg: DAI has continued to trade 200-300 bps above the peg over the past month.  We believe this lack of stability and liquidity is translating into uncertainty around using DAI as a decentralized stablecoin in many DeFi protocols. Anecdotally, we have heard a handful of DeFi teams express frustration over DAI\u2019s lack of liquidity/stability, with some opting to use USDC instead. We see this as damaging to DAI\u2019s network effects in the long run. On the community side, we have seen community members continue to express concerns across the forum, Reddit, and RocketChat.  Lack of DAI Liquidity: DAI remains very thinly traded across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. DAI\u2019s illiquid profile has continued to place additional strain on the peg as even small amounts of buy/sell activity have disrupted the market. Just 10 days ago, we saw CDP 3931 purchase ~5MM DAI, pushing DAI prices to over $1.04. The fact that a top 10 CDP holder was willing to pay 4% above the peg to exit the system is a negative signal. We expect to see additional pressure on DAI markets unless decisive action is taken to improve the liquidity and stability of DAI. As shown on Black Thursday, a lack of DAI liquidity can have damaging effects on MakerDAO and the broader DeFi ecosystem. For example, users may be unable to source DAI to keep their vaults adequately collateralized in the event of violent price movements. Keepers may be unable to acquire DAI to bid on undercollateralized vaults, thus increasing the likelihood of disorderly collateral liquidations or losses, among other negative ramifications. Market Makers\u2019 (MMs) Activity: With the introduction of USDC as collateral, we saw an initial uptick in the use of USDC to generate DAI with utilization climbing above 30%. However, this utilization has fallen to ~4%. This may indicate MM\u2019s decreased appetite to open a vault, incur friction costs/slippage from selling DAI into the market, and a growing uncertainty around DAI prices reverting to the peg in a reasonable time period. MMs may also be low on inventory to post additional USDC and mint DAI. We are seeing a negative flywheel effect take place where a lack of confidence in DAI prices begets further illiquidity. Potential Solutions:   Expedited Collateral Onboarding: We believe onboarding new collateral is an effective way to increase DAI supply and help bring stability to the DAI markets. We have been following the MIP ratification process and believe the MIP process will be effective over multiple governance cycles. However, given the current state of the peg, we believe new collateral should be onboarded in an expedited manner, considering the current timeline may take 4-6 weeks at least. This should stimulate new demand for vaults and stability for DAI markets.  While we have no vested interest in a particular collateral type, we have seen Uniswap LP tokens, LINK, PAX Gold, and others suggested in the community recently. Given its marketcap, liquidity profile, and appetite for speculation, we see value in onboarding LINK into MCD. For context, lending protocol Aave has seen close to $20MM in LINK supplied as collateral since launching in mid-January. LINK is valued at over $1 billion and is also one of the most liquid ERC-20 tokens available. The tokens are relatively decentralized with no known \u201ckill-switch\u201d or blacklisting capabilities. To protect MKR holders, the risk parameters can be set very conservatively: low debt ceiling, relatively high stability fees and liquidation ratio. We believe this should drive additional demand for opening up vaults and increase DAI liquidity.    Monetary Policy Changes: Governance has the capacity to lower the ETH SF to 0% and lower the USDC SF to 0%; however, we believe these changes alone may not be effective enough to drive additional DAI generation and should be done in tandem with onboarding new collateral.  Include a new ETH-DAI vault. This vault would have a lower liquidation ratio (125%/133%) which may drive new demand from Compound/dydx and initiate the generation of a few million DAI. A conservative debt ceiling could also be implemented.    Next steps: We would like to hear the community\u2019s feedback on the proposed solutions. Note that these are some general possibilities, and we suggest that they should be specified more fully by the Interim Risk Team before implementation. Please signal your thoughts below. Does the state of the peg constitute an emergency response within the next week?     Yes No Other     0 voters     ",

Taking such decisive action would hopefully have the effect of overshooting, taking the dai price below 1 USD, and from there the peg can then be stabilized from below, by increasing the DSR and the stability fees. This way we don\u2019t just get the peg back on track, we also get the DSR back which I think is also crucial for restoring confidence in the system and bringing DeFi back to normal. Then when the MIPs process begins, the domain teams can use MIP12 to adjust the collateral that has already been onboarded and make sure they still go through the full process for setting the risk parameters they will have for the long run. Everyone should list their favorite ERC20 collateral types that they\u2019ve been wanting to see added - even if they have relatively small market caps, as long as they are pure ERC20 and aren\u2019t scams it\u2019s a no-brainer to have the domain teams add the best of them in this kind of situation when the confidence of the system is on the line. Even assets that are correlated with ETH, like LINK, would help to source more Dai generation and help with restoring the peg and DSR, and can then later be hedged with uncorrelated assets that are more complicated to add (like PAXG) ",

Mainly given the consistency of the price of DAI above the peg, and the fact that the monetary policy levers are having a less rapid effect than desired. The state of DAI liquidity isn\u2019t something I spend a lot of time looking at, but given the recent events and the argument presented in the OP I think that\u2019s another point in favour of action sooner rather than later. I think that perhaps I\u2019d like to see a more measured response than firing all cylinders. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessary to set everything to 0% and to on-board as many ERC20\u2019s as possible also at 0%. I do worry that we need to present a calm and measured response to avoid further degrading confidence. I think setting all the SF\u2019s to 0 and on-boarding 3-4 new collateral types also set to 0% SF will be viewed as a desperate move by the market, and may result in other issues. Realistically, changing just USDC to 0% SF and 100% CR should result in a release of 10M of liquidity which would probably be enough by itself to significantly improve the situation (though obviously at the cost of having 10M of centralised collateral temporarily.) Adding LINK or other stablecoins at a low SF should also have a strong effect. ",

Personally I want to work on protocol around ETH and make using Maker with ETH ROCK SOLID for people and go from 1.7% ETH deposited to 2.7% and 140M outstanding and 300% deposit LR.  But hey I think state of enviroment and perception via the PR optics on this is MORE important than depreciating that work for adding collateral that even at $100M cap and 3% capture (double ETH btw) will only mint $1M DAI at 300% LR. Better as discussed is to do the following drop SF on USDC to .5% (same as ETH), personally would like to see DC drop to 5M so we can stagger DAI injection in 5M DAI stages.   LR on USDC left alone.as well. If we go the USDC route and leave DC at 10M I really would like to see the USDC OSM and liquidations enabled like normal colalteral type. The PEG is concerning and I would like to see it move back to $1 but it is clear that people are removing ETH from the system and/or not minting much.  I don\u2019t see that adding other collateral types with limited DAI minting is going to do much.  $1M - won\u2019t do much and this will take effort and time for virtually no real DAI being added to markets.   We need to see about 6-8M at least. I would prefer to see this come out in a measured DC controlled fashion in 5M tranches up to but not to exceed 10M to start and maybe 20M if necessary (but no more than 20M or 1/4-1/5 entire outstanding). Literally everything else if done properly and without massive haste simply won\u2019t do as well as focusing on completing the USDC onboarding past the \u2018emergency state\u2019 with OSM formally pegged to $1 and liquidations off. I am completely against a LR lower than 120 here as it would only take approx 2M to mint I want more players doing this with more USDC than less and a future look of adding on liquidations, and OSM here.   SF of .5% is somewhat arbitrary and matches borrow rates elsewhere especially since DAI is paying a higher rate on secondary markets atm. BTW:  God NO on new ETH vault with 125-130LR - we already completely shattered like 1/6 of our deposited ETH do we really need to suck them in again?   Please no on diff ETH facility agree with @Mitote this won\u2019t do anything except crank up liquidations and annoy people even more. ",

I\u2019m a bit biased here as a LINK holder, but what I can say that there are many other LINK holders who would be equally as willing as me to mint DAI against their LINK to purchase more LINK. I also think mTokens (mDAI, mUSDC) from DMM DAO would be another good collateral type to add as those tokens are overcollateralized by a basket of interest-generating real world assets which currently includes $8.5M in automobiles from the United States, but are expanding to more asset classes like aviation, construction, and real estate. These would be much more stable/uncorrelated to crypto as whole and is already ERC20 compliant with an in-built exchange rate, collateralization/valuation determined by chainlink oracles, and metatransaction support. Interestingly, mDAI most of the time technically wouldn\u2019t even need to be liquidated through an auction as there is a reserve of DAI held in the contract (in addition to the real world asset backing) so mDAI can be exchanged for the corresponding amount of DAI (same for mUSDC but then that USDC would need to be auctioned for DAI). This method would be subject to the liquidity of the reserve ratio set currently at 50% but liquidity is actually sitting at above 100% right now to attract more liquidity. If this isn\u2019t the right path or there\u2019s not enough in-built liquidity, then auctions can be performed as usual. Just as a disclaimer for transparency, I do work at DMM, but I do think there is real potential here and wanted to bring it up to the community. ",

Black Thursday showed that you absolutely cannot get liquidated. So what price floor do we see with full confidence for ETH in the short term? Maybe $70, but with some cascading liquidations currently lurking at $79, perhaps $50? Ok so set the liquidation price at $45 and the whole exercise is not worth our time anymore. Long story short: we need uncorrelated, price-stable collateral. I\u2019m not too informed about PAXG, but it would at least be uncorrelated and price-stable. ",

I also believe - and will comment when I have time that we can do quite a bit of things to improve this system for both vault owners and DAI owners.   But each time I toss out something it usually is a protocol change - and unless we have a DAI emergency seems to move in glacial time, vs.  instant time when others see a change as critical (i.e. the auction halt mechanism add),  we need a DAI minting halt, as well as collateral removal halt - which if we have all three that can happen instantly and only can be removed after GSM delay is a better way to halt the system than an ES imo. My goal is to create a system where the ES for the most part is off the table and instant halts can be on the table.   Then lets talk about liquidation insurance additional SF rate.   Most of these people if they could have had 24hr grace here with a fee for the service would NOT have been liquidated - or at least would have had a guaranteed 24hrs to get their vaults in order (i.e. liquidate themselves avoiding the 13% liquidation fees). I already have DSR-L not released as a full auction l iquidity backstop mechanism that can literally catch the system while it falls.   But we literally have to halt the system when market prices against OSM are massively disjointed >20%.   I have a growing list of ways to almost bullet proof this system and backstop it with OPD (other people\u2019s DAI) and give people options but they all require contract changes that people tell me will take \u2018years\u2019 - well hell crypto years are like dog years - projects literally live and die in year time frames.  I know there is a lot of the plate here of Maker - mostly because foundation wants to move aside - fast.   Personally I think we need to think about our clients and to improve robustness of the system first before we grow the thing. I was told once by a business person I valued.   To have a successful business focus on doing your business better than anyone else and everything else will follow.   There is one caveat before this - make bloody sure the market(s) you want to enter are large.   There is no point in having 10 businesses to make $1M when 1 can make you $10M if you focus and do it right. All IMHO. ",

I strongly agree that Dai\u2019s recent drift from the peg is a problem, not just for Dai users, but for the Maker ecosystem overall. The truth is that Maker does not exist in a vacuum, and people will shop Maker against other options for getting leverage on underlying collateral (mostly ETH, for now) and will shop Dai against other options for stablecoins, and I worry about competitiveness on both fronts right now. For Dai specifically, we\u2019re (anecdotally) speaking with a few teams that are considering switching to USDC away from Dai, and we see this switch already happening through on-chain data. dYdX posted its first day with more USDC-WETH volume than DAI-WETH volume last week. Currencies, even fully-backed ones like Dai, still rely on network effects and strong narratives, which can often unwind just as quickly as they grew. With this in mind, it\u2019s important to think about the problem itself, which is that ~6-10MM more Dai needs to be minted in order to re-peg. So, where is this going to come from? Problematically, overall interest in ETH leverage is down substantially since a month ago, almost 50% lower by Skew estimates.   Thus, trying to win the ETH leverage market is already going to be a less fruitful way to get this Dai minted than it would have been in March. Not to mention that with the SF at 0.5%, Maker is already the cheapest way to borrow Dai and get ETH leverage (looking purely at interest rates) from all the decentralized lending protocols. Because the ETH leverage market has shrunk and Maker is already winning this market on pricing, it\u2019s unclear to me that dropping SF even more will have a meaningful effect. We\u2019re open to proposals on new collateral \u2013 I think many of the candidates (LINK, PAXG, etc.) seem reasonable and I appreciate the Risk team\u2019s work to vet them \u2013 but it\u2019s also essential to keep our goal of minting 6-10MM more Dai in the next week top of mind. In this light, assets that are too small to generate meaningful Dai demand and assets that are too complicated to add in such a short time frame seem like they should be held for future discussion.

Coinbase\u2019s holdings on the other hand have continued to grow from the initial 20M to now 70M LINK tokens (5% to 20% of the circulating supply). Binance and Coinbase together now account for over 40% of the circulating supply of LINK. LINK\u2019s distribution across the two exchanges have just recently come to parity with each other with both exchanges holding 70M LINK.

Shorting DAI using USDC vaults also adds demand for DAI. And there will be naturally more demand for DAI as we get closer to the peg. Also maker holders may not have the commitment to continuously raise the USDC debt ceiling to whet the appetite for DAI. Maker holders should be committed to raising the debt ceiling for stablecoins further if needed. And onboarding additional stablecoins is important for risk and optics. Stablecoin vaults can\u2019t be the only solution to bring us back to the peg. The DAI supply shortfall must be met by minting from other sources.

Here is some idea for a more long-term working solution:  Maker contract allows to mint unlimited uncollareralized DAI to a special trading contract T; T can only dump that DAI for other stablecoins when DAI price is > 1. Or to deposit that DAI on Curve (which shifts DAI price down); If DAI price is < 1, the only thing that contract is allowed to do is to buy that cheap DAI and burn;  The whole operation (since DAI is only allowed to be sold when expensive and bought when cheap) is profitable, and so doesn\u2019t create the actual DAI being uncollateralized (although it may seem so on paper). That said, contract T having unlimited (or time-limited) DAI minting powers is quite a serious thing for the system, so that couldn\u2019t work as an emergency action. ",

                    "content": "scott from DEX.AG there is a very large long term problem for MakerDAO regarding the peg, CDP owners are more sophisticated than DAI holders. To get a CDP you need to learn quite a bit about how ethereum works and then learn about how Maker works. To use DAI you need to understand almost nothing besides how to use metamask for tokens. More sophisticated users lose their keys less often. So DAI wallets become dead quicker than CDP wallets. This mismatch is made quite a bit worse by the fact thatkeepers can close the CDPs held by dead wallets. As i have stated privately to various associated folks, this mismatch is a long term problem that will inevitably create as nasty DAI short squeeze if no solution is found. A short term solution should be something like:  Add $USDC as collateral. Set DAI pool cap at $10M Set USDC margin requirement to 1% Set USDC Stability Fee at 0% Set DSR at 2% Set ETH Stability Fee at 2%  A medium term solution is something like selling uncollateralized DAI on the market for 1.005, with a bid to buy this uncolleteralized DAI back at .995, vs USDC (or other stable coins). The long term solution is the DAI depegs from dollars and runs its owning monetary policy based on stability of purchasing power vs a global inflation metric. the collateral in CDPs would become more like a foreign reserve, with the floating DAI being uncollateralized. The long term solution requires nation-state size scale, so its prolly not that important to think about it too hard, as it is so far away. ",

Earlier this week I was thinking about a medium term solution while dealing with some insomnia.  Since insomnia ideas are the opposite of shower thoughts, it might be terrible with some obvious failing.  What\u2019s more, this idea probably wouldn\u2019t work all that well unless places like DEX.AG integrated it.  I\u2019m still wrestling with it, and the full version is probably its own post if not its own MIP, but here\u2019s the short version. We create a kind-of flywheel module to the Maker Protocol that is similar to the migration contract in that it has exclusive access to a set of collaterals with ideal parameters; a dark vault.  Sane DC limits, 0% stability fees, 100% collateral ratio, and no liquidations.  To the outside world this module would behave like a simple market trade.  Show up with ETH, BAT, or USDC, and get ETH, BAT, or USDC amount of DAI out, where DAI is minted at $1.  Same in reverse, show up with DAI and get back ETH, BAT, or USDC again where DAI is burned at $1.  The former service would be used when above peg, the later service used when below peg.  The one additional constraint is that the amount of liquidity is rate limited by seconds, risk, peg deviation, and some desired time-box where we return to the peg.  I\u2019m waving my hands at this formula for now. At the time, this seemed like a great idea:  For these time slices where DAI could be minted against collateral, we are no longer dependent on the fear/greed of market participants. The right formula could have us returning to peg within that timebox. More potent the further off-peg we get, and has very little liquidity when close to peg. Solves the peg problem efficiently when DAI is over peg and collateral markets are bullish, and when DAI is under peg and markets are bearish.  Both rare cases. Felt cleaner than a TRFM solution or PID controller on rates, as we can side-step the rate and market incentivization problem.  |-------------timebox-------------| |   t1   |   t2   |  ...  |  tn   | | 12k DAI| 10k DAI|  ...  | 2k DAI| |-------------1 week--------------|  Then, sweet sweet sleep came, and in the morning I started seeing all the failings: I was trying to fit the solution too much to our existing problem.  That is, it\u2019s a reasonably elegant solution for a set of market conditions that are rare.  Without going into detail on all the cases that could happen, it should be obvious that the underlying collateral is volatile and could leave those dark Vaults with either a surplus or debt. The surplus case isn\u2019t so hard to deal with as there are any number of things one could use the surplus for, burn MKR, buy DAI on the market, or just keep it around for a rainy day. But the debt problem defeated me.  The debt problem meant that the system would have unbacked DAI, and that we would probably need to accrue our losses to system debt, which could eventually result in flop auctions and dilute MKR holders.  This might mean that the available liquidity should probably be proportional to system surplus, and since we burned that on Black Thursday, it doesn\u2019t seem that helpful of a solution now. Anyway, this is where I gave up on the idea, or at least pushed it to a more long-term consideration.  I leave it here in case someone sees more failings or better yet, a way to make it work in the medium term.  At very least, perhaps it will inspire other solutions.  I don\u2019t know, maybe there\u2019s a way to integrate your idea for this failure case. ",

Operationally it could work like this: DAI held in a wallet that has been inactive for \u201cx\u201d number of years becomes inactive, transforming from DAI to DIE. The DIE becomes redeemable for a basket of collateral assets based on the OSM price of the collateral pool at the time it becomes inactive (basically a personalized emergency shutdown). Concurrently, the system mints and auctions/sells new DAI in order to accumulate the collateral assets required to pay the claims on new DIE. This would have the impact of recycling DAI from abandoned addresses and ensuring that lost keys/dust don\u2019t precipitate a liquidity crisis. But I\u2019m not sure if this would be possible technologically, and it would definitely pose unique risks as well. ",

I am not saying that current situation does not warrant special attention or need to act, but i am very much against quickly onboarding multiple collateral we don\u2019t understand, plus there won\u2019t be much dai generated in any case.

Binance    USDCUSDT | Buy USD Coin | Binance Binance cryptocurrency exchange - We operate the worlds biggest bitcoin exchange and altcoin crypto exchange in the world by volume      USDC has been maintaining its peg exactly, bc of the infinite 1:1 creation redemption available to coinbase users.  This is an amount many multiples higher than the $5-10 million predicted here.  you only have to sell enough DAI such that the \u201cDAI over par\u201d bid is satiated. the imbalance between buyers and sellers at par (the net of the imbalance is the size of the \u201cDAI over par\u201d bid) is unlikely (by my own dead reckoning) to be more than 10% of all DAI outstanding.  I strongly oppose the recent zeitgeist that catalogs everything as an emergency and demands unprecidented and uncalculated action.  DAI has been simmering in this danger zone significantly over par for a month. doing nothing risks an actual emergency where there will be hours, not days to push a fix. the farther DAI gets from par, the less available DAI there will be for sale each 1% up. there could be a situation where borrowers are in a catch22, pay 20% over par to buyback their DAI to repay their loan or get liquidated for a cheaper penalty, even though they had the money to repay if DAI was fairly priced. The fallout from this scenario would likely permanently impede MakerDAO\u2019s ability to pursue its vision for a decentralized stablecoin, and potentially make it impossible for any other decentralized stablecoin project to be taken seriously for years. The primary risk that needs to be acknowledged is that MakerDAO is currently sitting on a precipice. ",

MakerDAO is not on a precipice, that is just an illusion that people think right now. The actual market is what is it right now, WE make a difference with DAI supply or Crypto in general. MakerDAO has nothing to do with this either the MakerDAO Foundation. At the end, it\u2019s on the shoulder of the community and what they actually do with the offer and demand of the DAI. DAi is there to stay, there will have some change eventually i guess, but i am not thinking that way. It\u2019s just not possible, to keep the USD at a rate of 1,41USD for 1CAD with the crisis\u2026 there is something behind this\u2026 Where is the transparency of the Government in that situation ?

I agree that in short order we should set SF\u2019s to 0 and on-board new collateral types (LINK) and any others people feel are appropriate.  We could also consider lowering the CR on USDC although at 0% SF not sure it will makes a huge difference (just need to manage the USDC ceiling). Why are we at a tipping point?  The community is losing faith in DAI which is the whole reason MKR exists in the first place.  We need to get it on peg and quickly.  It\u2019s a virtuous/vicious cycle.  The longer it trades above the peg and governance doesn\u2019t adequately respond people will hesitate to use it and we will lose the network effects.  If we can get it on peg and keep it there people will be more confident in using it for stablecoin purposes.  Network effects are immensely vital to the success of DAI.  Also, anyone who says DAI trading above the peg even at 1.02 is not a problem, I\u2019m sorry but I vehemently disagree. What do we need to do now? (and we should do this on an emergency basis)  This multi-pronged approach of setting SF\u2019s to 0 and on-boarding new collateral will create new DAI issuance from USDC, LINK and other new collateral.  The fundamental problem is obviously that we can\u2019t set SF\u2019s < 0.  That creates governance limitation that we need to solve through other means by on-boarding new collateral and using USDC on a temporary basis.  We just need to maintain a lid on the USDC ceiling to manage concerns about how much USDC backs DAI for now.  I understand that some people are uncomfortable with having USDC back dai in some capacity, but given we are at the lower bound of our rate limits we need to consider this as a temporary emergency solution to get the peg down to maintain the network effects.  Regarding concerns about LINK or other assets being correlated it doesn\u2019t really matter right now because if we only have ETH we are already running the same-way risk just scaling it and creating more DAI liquidity in the process. Again to reiterate if we overshoot and end up with DAI below the peg it doesn\u2019t matter as we can always raise SF and attract DAI demand from savers and USDC CDPs will unwind below 1.00.  We all want MKR to succeed so let\u2019s make it happen. ",

I was thinking that they might also see value in using MCD to offer a line-of-credit against MCO to back their debit accounts.  I think MCO is worth investigating as collateral. That being said, a quick glance at the token tells me there are a lot of undesirable interfaces that would need a very thorough review before we could sign-off on a collateral adapter. ",

Other viable options (such as Uniswap tokens or PaxGold) have some technical restrictions that make them hard to implement on short notice. As a final caveat, while these are individual polls, it is unclear if they would all be implemented at the same time (it\u2019s hard to do conditional polling). Which of these are actually implemented should be discussed in this thread and the governance call.  Are you in favor of adding LINK as a collateral type to MCD?

                    "content": "Thanks for your open mindedness. I see these as the root DAI problems that the current contracts cannot solve: PROBLEM #1: No mechanism to deal with DAI above the peg and 0% SF PROBLEM #1 DESC: The current design cannot get DAI on the peg so we add new collateral instead. Adding collateral is not meant as a measure to control the peg - we should be able to add collateral regardless of the peg and at our own pace. We can have a situation that there is no arbitrage opportunity for borrowers of USDC/any coin with 0% SF - what then? SOLUTION #1:  No separation of DSR and DAI + negative SF AND/OR Undercollateralized loans / giving up on promise to redeem 1 DAI for 1 USD temporarily AND/OR Incentives for borrowers when there is no arbitrage opportunity and DAI is trading above the peg  I\u2019m not sure what the details of the solutions for 2 and 3 would be but I guess there are some solutions out there that other teams/blockchains are exploring PROBLEM #2: Trust in the collateral liquidation process (flip auctions) PROBLEM #2 DESC: People are afraid of borrowing because they fear that they wouldn\u2019t get a \u201cfair\u201d price for their collateral in liquidation PROBLEM #2 SOLUTION: The liquidation procedure should be extended to support DEX-es and include some notifications/delays\u2026 People must feel that the devs have done everything they could that they get the best price for their collateral - even if that meant a small possible loss/risk for the system as a whole. Maybe there is a way that the contract can decide when it is a time to ignore some large 1-day drops (delay selling) and when it is not. PROBLEM #3: Trust in the governance system/decisions PROBLEM #3 DESC: There is a known governance attack problem that needs to be solved thoroughly and I think we are on the right way to do it (dark fix). Besides that, we should solve the situation with bundling governance decisions and with SF decisions that sometimes make no sense. Some system parameters are chosen by the \u201crisk team\u201d instead of chosen by the MKR holders with a recommendation by the risk team. PROBLEM #3 SOLUTION: Minimize governance decisions about the SF/spread and make them (semi-)automatic. Separate governance decisions that do not depend on one another. Let MKR holders vote for all parameter values and let the risk team just set the range for the poll and the recommendation. PROBLEM #4: Transparency of the Maker Foundation PROBLEM #4 DESC: I don\u2019t think this problem is as important as the other ones and it is not connected to the DAI design, but it would be nice to have a roadmap with milestones, semi-annual financial reports, development progress, plans for their MKR/DAI holdings, jobs\u2026 PROBLEM #4 SOLUTION: a roadmap, a semi-annual financial reports etc. EDIT: bolding ",

I also want the SF on USDC to match the ETH one and .5% seems reasonable given market conditions.  If everyone wants to go to 0 on SF across the board.  I don\u2019t think it will do much except take the small amount of revenue the protocol makes and take it away for probably very little PEG effect. Rate isn\u2019t the issue here (not between 0 and .5% on SF) the issue is DAI liquidity which if we lower the USDC to .5% should come in pretty quickly.  (or at least we can see if it does). I have made my statements regarding collateral type additions.  I will be surprised if people use them to mint anything more than $1M DAI with exception of LINK and this isn\u2019t enough liquidity for a hell of a lot of work.   Get the USDC OSM and liquidations etc going normally on USDC and then we can talk about LINK.  PAXG I think has too low of a cap to produce any substantial DAI and we are heaping centralization risk on across the board.  If we are going to heap on centralization risk lets bag the big collateral dog on the block,  BTC. I also don\u2019t see the addition of UNISWAP ETH-DAI token as a choice above (which I would support) I think this one is a very easy addition.   Treat is almost like ETH and given 13% liquidation I really think we should not go much lower than 150% on the LRs on almost anything as after the 13% the vault owner at 120% isn\u2019t going to have any collateral left imo.   (LR-1*LF)/LR = 24.67% on ETH currently.   Lower this to 120 with LF at 13% and this becomes 5.8%.   Really think about your clients here and implications to them by making above types of changes\u2026    Personally I want to see LR go up a bit on ETH to maybe 180% and the LF go down to maybe 10% to give theoretical 45% collateral return on ETH vs. the 24.67% currently.   This potentially is huge for our vault owners when it comes to liquidations. ",

I\u2019d love to see ETH/DAI right away but relying on on-chain data could potentially create issues if the pool is unbalanced via a trade. This is similar to what happened with bZx a couple of months ago, so we\u2019ll probably need to work with Nik to get an Oracle stood up that medianizes the pool balances over time. It\u2019s not anything insurmountable, but it will take a little engineering to do it right. One thing that concerns me is the push to keep dropping the USDC SF. USDC is far riskier to the system than ETH, especially in light of the anti-stablecoin political climate, and the SF should reflect that. The system is vulnerable to state pressure to shut the adapter down, and I can\u2019t iterate that enough. USDC was added as a way to provide liquidity to keepers in a crunch, and it served that purpose. Stablecoins are not the long-term solution to restoring/maintaining the peg, they are not speculative instruments and so they create almost immediate repayment pressure as soon as they are issued. More (uncorrelated and speculative) collateral types are the answer here, but we need to be aware of the inherent risks of the collateral types that we do have. I\u2019m worried we\u2019re tossing levers just because we have them, without considering the long-term effects. I think Maker does have a trust issue among Vault participants right now, and it\u2019s going to take more than new collateral types and lower fees to restore that trust and confidence. We\u2019re also in the middle of a global financial crisis that\u2019s creating a lot of uncertainty in the markets. It\u2019s my personal position that the platform is sound as designed, but rapid changes made lightly will jeopardize that stability. Multi-Collateral Dai was designed to have more collateral types, so I think it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019ll add high-cap tokens like LINK. We just need to make sure we add them with the right risk parameters and that governance adequately manages those risks in the future. ",

The idea that this has priority over improving system mechanics and other important topics to my mind sends the following message to the community \u201cwell we did a few things to the system, we hope will work and stop other problems in the future\u201d along with another message \u201cdon\u2019t get liquidated you could lose it all\u201d and oh btw \u201cwe are onboarding PAXG, LINK, and whatever else\u201d just doesn\u2019t seem prudent when one is looking at getting a bottom line here of profits needed to fund the DAO in the 5-10M minimum/yr by system DAI growth to approx $.5-1B DAI and a stable thriving community. I completely agree with your \u201cI\u2019m worried we\u2019re tossing levers just because we have them, without considering the long-term effects.\u201d  I will add I am worried we are basically leaving open huge holes in this system exposing not just DAI and vault holders, but the entire DeFI ecosystem and Ethereum itself to a financial risk event that literally lays waste to the entire ecosystem.   Everyone will throw up their hands and start blaming everyone else.   Personally I find the risk of such an event growing dramatically and steadily reducing my own exposure in this space to get out of the way. I also agree with you that I wonder if people really are taking into account the macroeconomic picture here.   I mean even if Maker could command 1% of all crypto capital this amounts to no more than 2B collateral at this time.   At 300% LR this means maybe $.6B.   We were pushing $140M just on ETH on perhaps 2% of all ETH before getting smacked down 40-50M DAI on approx 190K ETH and are at 1.66%. I think I am just going to leave my whole - lets improve the system first - before jamming it full of other collateral and trying to grow it like mad by 10\u2019s if not 100\u2019s of collateral additions aside.  My impression is many folks subscribe to a view that somehow magically adding collateral is going to fix any of the other larger issues here and nothing else really needs to be done other than that.   My personal view is that if we fix what people percieve are the issues with the system currently we can grow much more with ETH, LINK and other correlated assets because the system will be ready and made more robust against these correlated asset moves\u2026  It is also my view that IF Maker as one of the most important DeFI participants can help provide the confidence in the crypto DeFI space that it could lead to a massive market cap growth phase in Ethereum based tokens as well as other coins creating the environment to safely and sustainably grow and support these protocols.   Literally to get to where Maker wants to be we need a crypto market cap 5x to $1T and if Maker can be the leader in this - we will have 5-10% of all ETH  ($5 -10B value at $100B ETH cap and $1T total cap) and god knows what ever other coins deposited in our most highly valued system for a most highly trusted and valued DAI stablecoin. Sure IMHO, sure this is opinion, maybe or maybe not an expert in anything (sure people can toss that out if they want opinions vary).     My real concern here is that instead of good solid steady growth of the entire crypo-economy people are going to push for the get it quick and drive this entire ecosystem and its participants into one or more thursdays that will be even blacker than 3/12-3/13 and last a hell of a lot longer.   As I like to say.   I will be happy to be wrong on this as this is how I usually learn something new and fortunately i am still learning.  Unfortunately I keep learning over and over that usually when I think something is bad it usually is worse and not better. ",

                    "content": "Echoing some of the more recent posts here \u2013 from a long-term perspective, the current deviation from the peg is unfortunate and warrants attention, but the solution is not an emergency action. I would urge us to fight the instinct to react too quickly and risk overreacting or compromising on fundamental principles. While it often seems that things move very fast in crypto, highly liquid, trusted, stable monetary systems are built on the scale of decades and centuries. We are in the midst of what is likely a once-in-a-century economic event. Even the most stable monetary systems out there are being challenged. Only a handful of weeks have passed since Black Thursday \u2013 an event which posed unprecedented challenges to the core liquidation systems that are the key backstop of DAI. In such an environment of a sharply increased perception of risk, are we surprised that we are seeing challenges in DAI liquidity? Over-focusing on the competition between DAI and USDC (or other centralized stablecoin) is not productive. From both the decentralization and liquidity perspectives, this is apples and oranges. If there are projects out there that are considering USDC over DAI for liquidity purposes, what they are really saying is that they are choosing to give up the decentralization benefits of DAI for the liquidity benefits of USDC. Fundamentally, DAI\u2019s unique value prop is its value being backed by decentralized assets. With the thus far limited value captured by decentralized assets (compared to fiat systems), it should not surprise anyone that scaling liquidity continues to be a challenge. In the foreseeable future, both systems will continue to exist, and applications that require liquidity more than decentralization will likely increasingly pick centralized stablecoins. IMHO, the path forward is to continue to focus on the fundamentals of building a decentralized stablecoin system, and to address the core problems illuminated by recent events. I don\u2019t claim to have any answers, but here are some fundamental questions that should be the discussion going forward:  What are the key improvements to the liquidation system that would prevent the kind of failure modes we\u2019ve seen recently? Is there a mechanism for the system to provide a DAI liquidity backstop in extreme scenarios? How can the system more predictably handle sudden spikes in demand for DAI? Are there key metrics that could illuminate the overall nature of liquidity in the system, that would allow better modeling of risks around cascading liquidations on inability to acquire DAI to close CDPs? How does the system grow liquidity when being backed by risk-on assets in a generally de-risking macro environment?  We are very much in the early days for DAI, and several weeks of lessened confidence in the system will be but blinks of an eye when put in the context of the many years it will take to scale liquidity to billions. Attempting to add incremental liquidity by quickly onboarding potentially problematic new collateral types is, at best, kicking the can down the road on fundamental issues, and at worst, adding new types of risk into a system. The more quickly we can start addressing fundamental risks, the faster the system can restore and grow trust, and eventually liquidity. ",

                    "content": " One thing that concerns me is the push to keep dropping the USDC SF. USDC is far riskier to the system than ETH, especially in light of the anti-stablecoin political climate, and the SF should reflect that. The system is vulnerable to state pressure to shut the adapter down, and I can\u2019t iterate that enough.  In this scenario, there would be plenty of advance warning for people to wind down their CDPs or have them liquidated before the adapter was shut down.  It would require a court order or new law to make this happen- not something that would occur overnight.  A graceful wind down would be the only way to protect innocent users.  So the main risk here is people needing to buy back the dai and having to find other sources of liquidity to keep the Dai price from going up again.  USDC was added as a way to provide liquidity to keepers in a crunch, and it served that purpose. Stablecoins are not the long-term solution to restoring/maintaining the peg  I don\u2019t agree with this.  Stablecoins are the only collateral that\u2019s not correlated with ETH right now.  USDC provides a great way to arb the peg (i.e. mint dai, sell for usdc, buy back dai when peg is reached) - its the only way to do it without worrying about the crypto markets.  I could see easily getting another 10m DAI minted for this reason.   Agree that we have to maintain a reasonable ceiling, but I don\u2019t see risks to MKR holders higher than with ETH collateral in terms of black swan events that could result in a major loss of the collateral value.

As well as uncorrelated collateral it\u2019s also important for collateral to have low volatility. The issue in crash across markets generally was correlations went to 1 AND volatility spiked (and has stayed high). I\u2019d push back on notion LINK is uncorrelated to ETH. i haven\u2019t modelled but looks positively correlated to ETH to me, just very high volatility. I think PAXG would be very useful collateral for stability as while gold does have higher volatility than usual right now it\u2019s not like crypto levels of volatility. ",

How about minting let say 1 MLN DAI selling it off for MKR effectively changing amount of collateral behind each DAI to ~0.988 USD (in case of Emegency shutdown) and see if that will drive price down. This is a method commonly used by central banks (SNB defending EUR/CHF rate at 1.2 for years being one notable example) maybe the real problem is in the fact, that Amount Basking each DAI  + Utility of holding DAI instead of collateral == Price of DAI not Amount Basking each DAI = Price of DAI and You cannot have those two equal under all circumstances. Sure expanding collateral base should to some extend push away a problem, but I guess problem itself is much more fundamental. ",

What you are suggesting is for MKR governance to be market makers. Generate  DAI and sell it for ETH and put that eth as deposit to the CDP which is governed by MKR governance not by external actor. That is quite interesting proposal I have to say! One thing is that here MKR holders take additional risk of bad debt defending the peg and not benefiting from it, so there is incentives misalignment. In what I suggest there are both sides. carrot and a stick. I guess You can even build external system where every MKR holder can choose to lock MKR or not  (let say for 12 months) and participate in both profits and possible loses (if DAI drops below the peg ) sure there is some complexity in finding when DAI needs to be buyed back and burned, but I guess it can be solved.

We are making changes that specifically incentivise the creation of more DAI  (though admittedly not from ETH) We want the price of DAI to drop.

Not the exchange and pooling group. If you guys are aware of the new proposal from the new government and the next months or years, you will be happy to be here i think. Major changes will occur, and MakerDAO will go to the next level, make the adjustments, and keep driving the bus, for this, we need good contributors and active one. ",

It\u2019s so premature to say this. In practice, we haven\u2019t even seen the current design yet. Almost all of the Dai comes from ETH currently. The whole design was labelled Multi-Collateral and we have barely seen that in action.  Interesting framing, @LongForWisdom. If the increase to the ETH ceiling doesn\u2019t increase supply sufficiently, then maybe it\u2019s time to expediate more collateral types. Although (and I\u2019ve said this pre-MCD launch), I\u2019m hesitant of the nonlinear growth in risk for each new collateral type that\u2019s added. MKR holders might be able to evaluate interasset correlation, but community polls probably won\u2019t. ",
