The Domain framework has since been superseded by the Core Unit Framework and all necessary transitions from the former to the latter are long finished. Therefore, these MIPs no longer serve any purpose in MakerDAO and should be marked as Obsolete in the interest of keeping the MIPs Framework slim and reflective of the status quo.
