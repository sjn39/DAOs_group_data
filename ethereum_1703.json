Unfortunately it does not yet look as good as I hoped (https://twitter.com/wallethapp/status/1023856148041134080). Would be great to get more support for it. Also please test with wallets you know - would be great to get more data-points on this. ",

But realized fast that this will be hell to edit in a table of github wiki page. Will make a extra repository that creates this table from json files. The matrix should not only contain support of ERC-681 - but more ERCs and I also want to split ERC functions (e.g. ERC-681 value payload detection, ERC-681 function detection support, \u2026 ) ",
