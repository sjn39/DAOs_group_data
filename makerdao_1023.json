                    "content": "Note: This Signal Request has been amended to include an actionable outcome from the vote.   TLDR  Restart Burn Immediately  Burn at a reduced rate until we develop something better.   Restore Revenue Distribution Narrative  Burn until we have a concrete system to replace it.   Retain Investors Retain our Community & Talent   Overview In my opinion, putting aside my own personal shituation, shutting off the burn at a market cycle bottom was arguably one of the worst decisions we have made as a community to date. I will admit that are benefits to operating on a model that prioritizes reinvesting into growth during early stages rather than distributing revenue. It works for Amazon, and it works for many others as well. It may even work for us as well. Unfortunately, in practice, what we\u2019ve done is turn off the only revenue distribution model we had\u2026 at a market cycle bottom. I know it was not perfect. It was inefficient, gameable, and didn\u2019t perceptibly return value to MKR holders. Still imperfect as it was, people liked it. I liked it, and so did many others. As it stands, we have no concrete plan in place to distribute revenue. We removed what we had but are yet to replace it with anything new. Our community members and long-term investors are dropping out like flies. Some from 2018 PTSD, others have just lost faith in our governance community\u2019s ability to deliver. We still have revenue, though! It may be less than before, but that\u2019s expected during a period of market contraction and a general reduction in appetite to borrow and take on risk.  This is temporary!  No market can maintain consistent negative perp funding indefinitely. A majority of market players taking one side of a position for pushing six months now are inevitably going to get rekt. It\u2019s rare that everyone is right.  At some point there will be a new funding cycle. People will get excited and borrow again. I\u2019m not concerned about our temporary dip in revenue. The burn is what retained many of our investors for years. Even through Black Thursday, one of the most challenging times we had to face as a community, we held through it. Yes, we did mint, and MKR suffered but has recovered since. As it stands, though, we still have the mint risk but no burn to counterbalance it. This puts many of our holders into a very tricky state of having to weigh underwriting huge codified downside risk with no clear promise of upside. It becomes very easy to justify classifying MKR as an overly risk-on asset during liquidity crunches. Dumping during times of uncertainty is a no-brainer. As each individual dumps, we increasingly expose ourselves to a governance attack. At this point, the illiquidity of MKR may be the only thing saving us from a nefarious actor buying up enough MKR to control the system. None of us want to see this. Given how essential Maker and DAI are to this space and the world in general, it would be disastrous to allow ourselves to capitulate into handing over control of this protocol to bad actors. It\u2019s not just about \u201cwen moon?\u201d or \"number go up blz! Ya, I\u2019d like that\u2026 since I\u2019m super rekt right now\u2026 \u201ccan dev do something?\u201d I wish\u2026 but that\u2019s not important. MakerDAO is genuinely in a place to change the world for the better. We deliver untold value and self-sovereignty to people in parts of the world that have nowhere else to turn to but DAI. Do any of us really expect them to use UST or USDT? They want\u2026 no\u2026 they NEED DAI. We need to retain our community at all costs to succeed. Complacency right now will be the end of us.   Restart the Burn So, in part\u2026 I understand why we shut off the burn. We had extreme slippage, and it appeared like we were just wasting money. The slippage was terrible, yes. It\u2019s a consequence of our community kicking the can down the road about implementing any sort of marketing-making scheme\u2026 but it is what it is for now. If we burn, it will be with slippage. The other argument for not burning was that we need to save DAI in the treasury to accumulate for a true Black Swan. Maybe?? It just so happened that as that sentiment creeped in and we decided to pause Burning, it was at the exact bottom (so far, knock on wood) for crypto. Yes, I know Macro fell more later on. Anyway, we got all flustered and cash happy at arguably the worst time to hoard cash. Although it may seem like everything is dumping, as it stands, BTC and ETH are just holding a steady uptrend. (Yes, I know it looks ready to go to zero any day now\u2026 but how else does a market shake everyone out?) Basically, we started hoarding cash when it was time to deploy. As the market continues to appear worse and worse, we continue to hoard. Regrettably, no amount of hoarding will protect us from a Black Swan if one is coming. The SB will be drained instantly, MKR will be minted\u2026 and nice knowing all of you! At these prices, though, do we REALLY lack so much faith in our project that we wouldn\u2019t buyback and burn when it\u2019s undervalued by at least two orders? Finally, IMO, all price action below $2,000 MKR can be directly attributed to removing the burn.  Poll Detials We can restart the burn with a reduced lid parameter to mitigate many of the inefficiencies we faced on our last auction. We will burn at a slower rate but maintain our original revenue distribution model until we enter a new funding cycle and/or once a new tokenomics model is developed, has community approval, and is ready to be implemented. Note: The Risk Core Unit Team suggests reducing the hump to $54M, so I will be including that value for this Signal Request.     Lower the SB? | Restart the Burn?     Yes: Reduce hunp to $54M.  No: Take no action at this time. Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until May 14th. 2022-05-02T00:00:00Z\u21922022-05-14T11:11:00Z If successful, an on-chain vote will be held to confirm the changes.  Note: This poll assumes @ultraschuppi\u2019s Signal Request to change the lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter passes successfully. I will issue a second Signal Request to change the \u2018lid\u2019 parameter if it does not. An over;y aggressive burn will be inefficient.   Next Steps  If we opt to restart the burn, we should focus on fully developing a new tokenomics and revenue distribution model complete and ready to go for a seamless transition from one paradigm to the next. Everyone should put a post-it on their screen or tattoo it onto their forehead:  \"Never again switch up a narrative at a market cycle bottom.\" It\u2019s great to experiment with new ideas, but save that for the euphoric stage of the market. There\u2019s a lot more forgiveness in those times.      Burning & Aggressive Growth | A Potential Marriage We can design a very efficient burn schedule based on sentiment counter trading if we decide to retain a burn model down the road. It\u2019s not very complicated and allows both strategies to coexist. The basic premise is to accumulate DAI for Aggressive Growth during manic market phases and burn during fear and capitulation phases. These phases are reasonably easy to identify and don\u2019t require much data. If we opt to retain any kind of burn model, I would be happy to contribute here.  A Sample Burn Schedule  4511\u00d72516 749 KB  The chart above shows market sentiment data from 2020 to the present.  The neon dots below change colors to indicate a shift in market sentiment.  The colors correspond to periods across the spectrum of the overall market sentiment. During Manic Phases, we should pause burning and accumulate for Aggressive Growth. During capitulation and fear phases, we should ramp up the burn.    Pink & Light Pink: Mania and Euphoria | Immediately cease burning. Accumulate into the treasury.  Orange & White: Neutral | Light burn. Predominantly accumulate into the treasury.  Blue: Fear | Crank the Burn  Green: Panic and Capitulation | Initiate Nitro Burn  Red: Extreme Capitulation | Activate Nitro Burn on Steroids     Note: - Red is the maximum level this indicator can theoretically output. - However, Red appears so infrequently that waiting for it is not practical.     Final Thoughts I know the burn model we had wasn\u2019t perfect, but I hope I\u2019m not talking to a wall here. I want to see Maker thrive. If there\u2019s something so much better we can implement right now, then sure\u2026 but we\u2019re notorious for moving slow. Aggravating? of course\u2026 but it\u2019s how we\u2019ve built our reputation. Every change and upgrade is checked twelve times before being implemented. We build to last, but let\u2019s not bleed our talent and community.  Words of Wisdom  850\u00d7400 41.7 KB  Whatever your view on the market is\u2026 no matter your conviction, remember to pause and look around. Can you find anyone that disagrees with you?? If the answer is no, ask yourself\u2026 are you really in the minority? Maybe I\u2019m the fool here, and everyone else is right.   Archived: Signal Request V1 ",

Buyback & Make is likely a superior model, and I would wholeheartedly support it.  Regrettably, it is not live yet. Once it is ready for deployment, I would fully support a shift to that model over pure burning.   I would like to work with Wintermute, as I have built a relationship with them and believe they are good actors. I would also like to see @MakerMan\u2019s ideas implemented alongside for on-chain liquidity solutions that our protocol can directly earn revenue on. As it stands, the only tool that we have ready on hand to deploy is the burner. Everything else, no matter how much better it may be, is nowhere near to being ready for deployment. We cannot afford to lose any more of our community members who feel disenfranchised as they capitulate and abandon Maker.  The losses from this Brain Drain are incalculable and outweigh every other argument that favors delaying taking action until better tools are developed.   If we lose our community, we lose MakerDAO.

It is the minimum recommended SB size for debt collateralized by volatile assets.

I hope my comment is the bottom. Even if the market is very bad, it can crash another 1k in price to finally kick out all the doubters, if we now burn a little over 10k+ MKR and thus 16Million, I think exactly then in the weak market phases we should then use the cash and what is the picture for people working at the DAO that there might not be enough cash to pay them, SB is for risk according to the CU Risk, but we are ignoring that we should have also enough buffer to maintain the CU member and even if the protocol generates less fees, these should be paid according to the MIPs that we agreed and voted for. In principle, I do not accuse any CU of only wanting to milk the DAO. Burn when we have a robust 250 million SB, or when we have diversified revenue sources that give us good cash flow. At best, the optimised tokenomics where burn is redundant or a part of it. ",

Though, in the current climate, I see no way for us to raise anywhere near $150M in a short time frame. Even with $150B in the SB, I see us as sitting ducks if a true black swan was to hit. I am not as pessimistic as everyone else about the market direction, but $50m, $70m, $150m\u2026 none of those will protect us. In our current state, we would have to fall back on our ultimate backstop. Minting MKR. To successfully cover insolvency, we would need deep liquidity and a high MKR price. We can address much of our liquidity issues using @MakerMan\u2019s LP ideas coupled with further assistance from Wintermute. The next issue to address is the price of MKR itself. A sure fire way to ensure it doesn\u2019t rise is to signal to our investors that we have no intention of burning and have no concrete plan to distribute revenue. I do not want to resort to ponzinomics to bring our price up. That\u2019s against our ethos, but sending a signal to our investors that we don\u2019t care about them compounds the risk to our protocol as they lose faith and dump. ",

When I think about a company increasing stock buybacks as revenue goes down\u2026 It just doesn\u2019t seem right. I know this analogy is a bit of a stretch, but the basic thinking behind it holds. Growing Maker means to grow organic DAI demand. Burning MKR has no effect on that. Maker is leading innovation in RWF and D3M, and there are some other low-hanging fruits it could reasonably pick to increase DAI demand. Many of those have been outlined in the comments here. From lending more aggressively to startup DAOs to lobbying for DAI at payment providers. Also, MakerMan has a good point here:    [Signal Request] Restart The Burn  [V1] xxx [Canceled] [Refer to updated V2, link below]   DeFI now offers DAOs much better tools to invest capital that earns return and satisfies DAO goals, the flapper mechanic is completely outdated and a waste of resources.

If there\u2019s one thing I learned in my life and my career it is this: Never act from desperation. It only leads to more pain.

We removed what we had but are yet to replace it with anything new.   Even if this signal does not pass, it seems important to address these valid concerns. Maybe a new system for distributing part of the protocol\u2019s profits to tokenholders could be tied to reaching a certain target level on the Surplus Buffer (say, 250m). This could provide more certainty (essentially a new social contract) for community members that share the concerns above. ",

I don\u2019t know what the best parameters are necessarily. I chose values that were suggested to me. With the current vote distribution, it looks like this SR is set to pass, but I don\u2019t want it to pass by a razor thin margin. That shows we don\u2019t have community alignment on this subject remotely.     rspa:  MakerMan has a good point here:    [Signal Request] Restart The Burn  [V1] xxx [Canceled] [Refer to updated V2, link below]   DeFI now offers DAOs much better tools to invest capital that earns return and satisfies DAO goals, the flapper mechanic is completely outdated and a waste of resources.     He really does have a good point, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for him. Yet, I feel like he\u2019s been trying to push this idea through months now, and it\u2019s gained no traction whatsoever. Our community just doesn\u2019t seem seem interested in implementing his ideas any time soon, or ever. Either from apathy, overstretched bandwidth, or simply not understanding the value add his ideas will bring.     rspa:  Never act from desperation.   I am guilty of this right now\u2026 yes. For the first time in the seven years I\u2019ve been supporting Maker, I feel like we are facing an existential threat to our existence as we bleed out talent and long time supporters due to our inaction. Capital can be lost and gained, but losing a community is much harder to recover from. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re past the point of no return. I do believe we can still turn this around.     Matt_NZ:  To paraphrase @Traster_Tray, Maker has shifted away from the initial \u2018social contract\u2019 that MKR investors originally signed up for.   This ^ I invested into MKR based on its foundational social contract.  Good Governance \u2192 MKR burns, and the protocol provides the only buy pressure Poor Governance \u2192 MKR dilutes, governors suffer the consequences  To me, that was a perfect equilibrium and quite an ideal incentive structure. It requires no outside buyers to deliver value to holders. I feel like that narrative has been lost. One side of the balance is live (the mint), while the other is being deliberated on with no particular timeline in sight\u2026 \u201csoon\u201d \u2014- So, yes\u2026 burning here may be symbolic. It\u2019s a signal to our remaining investors that we still honor returning value to them on the original foundational principles that led them to stay with our community in the first place. Also, I really struggle to find a good argument why we wouldn\u2019t buy back our own shares at such a deep discount\u2026 at least a little.     Matt_NZ:  Even if this signal does not pass, it seems important to address these valid concerns. Maybe a new system for distributing part of the protocol\u2019s profits to tokenholders could be tied to reaching a certain target level on the Surplus Buffer (say, 250m). This could provide more certainty (essentially a new social contract) for community members that share the concerns above.   Months away\u2026 at best\u2026. and we\u2019ll continue to bleed out our community every day we take no action.     ultraschuppi:  you can\u2019t have a lid lower than bump - this would reduce burning to 0  we can tune lid and bump down even more, but this would not be good for keepers as well.   Maybe $54m was too aggressive. I could raise \u2018hump\u2019 to $60m or $65m. We would burn just a nominal fraction of our SB, while still demonstrating commitment to our foundational values. From there, raise \u2018hump\u2019 incrementally until something viable to replace the burn is live. \u2014\u2014 Re raising organic demand for Dai? The entire space is waiting for us to launch on L2\u2019s. Just launching MCD on Arbitrum alone will open the flood gates .

I understand that everyone, myself included, would like the value of MKR to appreciate. However, burning acts as a bandage. The real solution relies on growth activities through a beefed-up SB to increase revenue and the protocol\u2019s fundamental value. It won\u2019t result in overnight appreciation, but developing the core value props will get us there. As for revenue distribution, there are some exciting conversations ongoing for new, innovative DAO governance and token models. These ideas go above and beyond the burning mechanism to return value to the community. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing those ideas develop for the future of the DAO. For now, we\u2019re in tough times, and focusing on building real value is how we weather the storm. ",

Thankfully, we\u2019re still retaining many of our core dedicated supporters\u2026 but even they have a breaking point. From the close split of this vote alone, it\u2019s clear that this is an issue that matters to a good portion of our community. We all want aggressive growth and progress. We want to reinvest into MakerDAO and see it grow to its full potential. We all want to see it succeed. Is it unreasonable to view burning here as an investment?

MKR is supposed to be like an insurance policy. Letting MKR devalue that much is irresponsible. And its going to get worse in regards to Eth-MKR ratio in a few months after the merge if there is no burn. Also there is no relieve insight. I will still continue to use exclusively DAI but I put my MKR purchases on indefinite hold. Also I think the burn mechanic is very tax efficent value acrual. For the people that dont believe in it please observe whats going to happen with Ether longterm after the merge. ",

Higher MKR price attracts more buyers means more liquidity for MKR that also means that incase of a blackswan there is more liquidity to secure Dai. Higher MKR Price leads to more security and credibility for Dai. With no upside but only potential risk why would anyone buy MKR? Whats the logic behind that? Governance is not a sought after quality in a token, see UNI going from 22 Billion to 4.5 Billion. (Uni is only at thar price because people hope that a value acrual mechanism is going to be released) In summary, lower MKR price leads to less security and make DAI overall less appealing atleast to the people who understand. Taking care of MKR price is as important as funding development. There must be a balance. ",

I don\u2019t think the parameters are right, and I don\u2019t think the reviving the old mechanism, on merit of its existence is right. I love the dialogue about how to best achieve the aim of making MKR holders wealthy, and want to see this as a part and parcel of an overarching strategy to improve Maker\u2019s position.

If the value proposition is now solely that it buys you a vote in the governance process, then how does that vote actually benefit the holder? If they vote diligently, and prudently, and intelligently, the platform can be a success, and even generate revenue - but then what? We can talk about \u201caggressive growth\u201d or \u201cdeploying the reserves\u201d etc. etc., but all that must be a means to some end that returns value to the holders. Otherwise holding Maker is nothing but downside, since it\u2019s the collateral of last resort. You can\u2019t blame todays holders for not trusting governance that one day they will be made whole. To an outsider, it looks very much like governance has been reactionary / improvised on the fly ever since the DAO transition. I consider that the burn was the mechanism that wasn\u2019t meant to be turned on and off at will. Governance has taken something beautiful in its simplicity and started playing \u201cCentral Bank\u201d with it - a role which I can\u2019t help but feel it is ill equipped to perform. ",

                    "content": "Well, I\u2019m not going to say I understand all the factors at work but I\u2019ll tell you my thoughts.  Ethereum hit a peak in May, crashed, and then ran back up at a slower pace from July to September.  What was unfortunate was that Ethereum ran back up to an even higher place in November but MKR did not participate in that rally at all.  My conjecture is that the expanding CU budgets being proposed made a big impact in there and even though the underlying revenue did rise with eth price, there was negativity with rising expenses and the ending of the mkr burn. Anyway, it\u2019s all good if those investments bear fruit.  Theoretically the CU expenditures are supposed to eventually produce growth.  But we don\u2019t see it yet so some investors are probably losing trust that CU investments are actually bearing fruit.  Maybe it will bear fruit but it seems like it\u2019s going to take awhile.  The promise of RWA is that we can finally grow without being so tied to the crypto markets.  If you see revenues start growing from non-crypto collateral, I think MKR price will start to become more disconnected from the broader crypto market.  But crypto loans basically make up all of our revenue right now so it will be awhile before that actually happens. If you are a long term investor, you really have to remind yourself that the protocol is still profitable so if you believe in the vision, you can give it time to bear fruit.  There still isn\u2019t too much in terms of competition for crypto bridging into the real world so it\u2019s not clear how all this will end up.  There are a lot of risks that give us some urgency though.  There\u2019s a lot more competition on the crypto side so if MKR loses market share on its bread and butter crypto collateral, revenue will go down.  Or if the fed interest rate actions start affecting DAI demand, and you\u2019re forced to defend the peg by increasing the DSR, spending will go up.  And if we ever start to be unprofitable without clear revenue growth\u2026well, look out below. ",
