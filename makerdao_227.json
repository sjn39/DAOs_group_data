I plan to begin posting these updates on a more regular basis to help the community stay aligned on the dust parameter and respond to changing conditions.   EIP 1559 and Gas Market Changes Ethereum recently activated the London hard fork, which initiated EIP 1559. This creates a fairly large change to the gas fee market. Gas fees are now separated into two sections, a base fee and miner tip. The ba\u2026     That said, if the ETH POS merge is successful and gas costs reduce then we may be able to review this.

This Optimistic rollup will facilitate the mass scaling of Ethereum and EVM compatible smart contracts by reducing transaction costs and latency. Optimistic rollups make this possible by minimising the amount of on-chain data by rolling up data into a cryptographically hashed transaction to reduce the required computation on base layer Ethereum.
