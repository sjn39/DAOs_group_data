                    "content": " Background Immunefi Security has a core unit mandate to perform a fire drill. However, our fire drill was delayed because it turned out that nobody knew exactly what we were suppose to do. DeFi Safety offers services under the fire drill category focused on checking a multisig. However, it was not clear how to apply a similar kind of approach to Maker\u2019s governance system.  With the introduction of Recognized Delegates, executive spells are often passed in less than 24 hours and usually within a few days (see Feb & Jan). This seems like a quick reaction; however, these are regularly scheduled executive spells. How long would it take to pass an unexpected, unannounced emergency executive spell?  Proposal  A fire drill will be declared every month at a random day and time.   Delegates will be asked via emergency communication channels to sign a message.   Reaction time will be measured and recorded.     Benefits  Although there is currently a track record of Recognized Delegates passing executives promptly, there is no direct incentive for them to do so. According to @prose11, the current rule is that an executive has to be supported (or opposed ) within one week to fulfill the Executive Participation metric. Conducting a periodic fire drill will provide assurance that Recognized Delegates can react promptly to an emergency.   A plot of reaction times shall be displayed on a Delegate\u2019s information page. This will help MKR holders to decide where best to delegate their MKR.   Median (or some other quantile) reaction time could be incorporated into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier.     Discussion Points Is monthly a good frequency? Fire drills are annoying, but we must stay vigilant. It\u2019s a necessary evil.      Every two months Monthly Every two weeks (fortnightly) Abstain     0 voters     How fast is fast enough for a Delegate to react?      12 hours 24 hours 36 hours 48 hours Abstain     0 voters     Should we incorporate some measure of reaction time into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     According to TechOps (@Jeannette_Rigor), Signal (primary) and WhatsApp (backup) are used for emergency communications to Recognized Delegates. Both of these services rely on a central server. Are any decentralized solutions up to the task yet? EPNS? I would like to thank @prose11, @monkey.irish, and @Derek for contributing to this idea.

One other point in these emergency drills (not just for delegates but governance as well). We desperately need to do a EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN fire drill and need to determine how to conduct this. Point here is that I don\u2019t believe delegates can activate the ES directly, but only MKR IOU holders or MKR holders could.  Also the threshold at 100K is higher than current delegated total.  F Formally simulating whether MKR could exit MKR from governance and dropped into the ES in a timely manner is much more difficult to assess vs. whether they can just sign a (I am here ready to act) tx. As added color:  I voted YES to the response performance being part of delegate performance here, but I think some real discussion about what is \u2018appropriate\u2019 response to qualify or modify compensation would be warranted.

We\u2019re working on a retrospective, but no reason to wait on addressing this point. This drill was designed to be as low impact as possible, with a ping on the Maker Discord and Forum for Recognized delegates. In a true emergency situation we would be knocking on every comms channel we have available. However in this one, the goal was just to see how effective voters would be responding to an unknown event at a poor time. With nearly 90,000 MKR voting on the poll with no additional vote wrangling I was personally quite pleased. We were able to get an onchain response from many, and a few more indicated they would have been able to go vote in an actual emergency situation. My goal was to balance a stress test with respecting people\u2019s time over the weekend and felt this structure would allow us a genuine test without proving inconvenient for the community. We\u2019ll be gathering more feedback to see how we can do this better in the future, if we feel the need for a surprise drill again. ",
