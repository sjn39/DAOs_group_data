The greenPill movement is about spreading the impact of regenerative cryptoeconomics. So this is a write up that enables anyone to do it. Here\u2019s how you do it.  Screen Shot 2022-05-06 at 10.03.38 AM1498\u00d7812 73.8 KB   Get some green tic tacs.  You can get these in many places, here they are on Amazon.   Order some Green Pill labels  (I prefer using die cut stickers from Stickermule) using this label.   Combine the two.  Youll likely have to make cuts in the sticker on each tic tac in order to make sure that each tic tac box can be opened.   Green pill the world!

Instead of buying the stickers to paste on the tictac box, I just sized up the labels and printed the design at Fedex Kinkos. Then I cut them out and scotch taped the labels on.  Easy peasy. Here is the google doc I used: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IcwEdfJw06brnX_yBKAJebteJxR-86Ufz9vcj3CDTQo/edit. Note the white space goes over the tag on the back. I thought about adding a QR code but didn\u2019t put in the extra effort/time. I did see a guy with a branded NFC tag on the back of his phone which are super cheap better than business cards in 2022. I\u2019m sure the quality was less than the original but it was still a fun experience to hand them out and culture building gift. I just gave the entire packets out inside of individually green pilling folks. I became immediately aware of giving seemingly candy to random women strangers  just seemed to not be the right vibe lol. There were a couple of far reaching tweets I will see if I can gather them and post photos. ",
