Paragraph Summary MIP65 onboards a RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and invest them in approved bond strategies. This MIP, importantly, also set out strict conditions for the setup of the underlying legal and governance structure and verification requirements. The proposal should be seen as connected with MIP68 in accordance the strategy outlined in Monetalis Evolution  Component Summary MIP65c1: Legal Structure & Asset Strategy Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding This component sets out the verification mechanism and conditions ensuring appropriate collateral is onboarded using an appropriate legal structure and governance framework using an appropriate technical solution. MIP65c2: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding This component contains the technical requirements for unambiguous technical execution of the collateral onboarding  Motivation  USDC is a large single-asset exposure on Maker\u2019s balance sheet - and pays no yield. We believe that working with professional bond managers and starting a diversification strategy can, and should, be implemented with priority. From the many discussions and proposals on the Maker forum on this topic, we believe there is solid consensus in the Maker Community on the necessity and desirability of this course of action. As of today, substantive efforts and work have been undertaken on many fronts related to this type of situation within CU\u2019s, the protocol, the Maker Community and Monetalis. This MIP set out a clear path for combining these efforts and work output into an execution hereof.   Specification / Proposal Details  MIP65c1: Legal Structure & Asset Strategy Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding Legal structure and Governance Monetalis will set up a legal trust structure, and governance framework, with the necessary contractual relationships and legal protections to make it appropriate to act as large scale RWA collateral for Maker. This includes, but is not limited to:  No ability by third parties or Monetalis to access the funds or change the terms of the legal structure Maker Governance has complete ability to trigger a liquidation with a successful executive vote encoding an instruction to the trustee of the structure. It should not be possible for a single third party to block the ability of Maker Governance to make decisions or modify the structure. There must be no apparent weak links or edge cases that allow funds to get misappropriated or stuck. An Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction, ensuring only appropriate bond assets and strategies can be acquired by the structure All surplus generated by the legal structure must be manually sent to the Maker surplus buffer every quarter. A Monetalis fee of 0.15% of AuM deployed p.a. paid quarterly.  This above established structure must set up a relationship with a regulated crypto broker, and an ETH address must be emitted that can be used to construct the smart contracts necessary to complete the next step of the onboarding process specified in MIP65c2. Legal Structure and Governance Appropriateness Verification The Real World Finance Facilitator and the \u201cin SES incubation\u201d Facilitator of Legal and Transactions Services must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the legal and governance structure appropriateness for holding a large amount of low risk real world asset collateral for Maker. Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction Verification The Strategic Finance Facilitator must, also through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction ensuring that only execution of bond strategies appropriate to use as large scale liquid RWA collateral can be acquired with assets provided to the legal structure by Maker. Technical Verfication The Collateral Engineering Services Facilitator must, again through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the technical appropriateness of the MIP21 designed solution in accordance with the Collateral Onboarding process (\u201cCOB\u201d). Should one such Verification not be forthcoming, for whatever reason, this MIP will not move forward in the COB.  MIP65c2: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding The technical implementation must follow the MIP21 framework. Upon Collateral Engineering Services solution Verification in MIP65c1, the relevant smart contracts must be constructed and deployed. It should hardcode the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure specified in MIP65c1, and follow the MIP21 framework. These smart contracts must only allow for the generation of Dai through a vault that is sent to the ETH address of the legal structure as its ultimate destination, and it must not be technically possible to send the Dai elsewhere, in accordance with MIP21. There must also not be any additional technical features or complexity that goes beyond the minimum necessary smart contracts and dummy constructs to enable the generation of Dai and its transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure. The ability to initiate the generation of Dai from the vault and trigger their transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure is given to an Ethereum address controlled by Monetalis. This address must have no ability to access the funds. When the collateral onboarding process for MIP65 has progressed to step 7 in the COB, an executive vote must be created (or code must be bundled into a broader executive vote) that activates all permissions for the vault to be onboarded based on the smart contracts specified in MIP65c2. The vault must provide:  Debt Ceiling of DAI 500 million. Stability Fee of 0% (surplus is paid manually through the legal structure, as specified in MIP65c1.) All other parameters must be set to ensure they have no functional impact.  ",

We have now enough the scale and sophistication to attract the best counterparts. To clarify, managing a treasury book of 100s of MM or B is VERY DIFFICULT and not territory for the uninitiated. I am looking forward to hear more about this proposal. I believe Monetalis (and other platforms) can help the community immensely. One thing I want to add though. With Moentalis also pitching itself to be a large scale / deep tech / structured credit investor, I struggle to see how the two proposals can coexist. Developing a platform able to originate 100s of MM of structured credit by onboarding alt platforms requires 10s of people, financial resources, and a lot of time in order to build the tech stack. I am unconvinced Monetalis could deliver on both front simultaneously. Given the date of publication of this MIP, I believe that this implies @Allan_Pedersen believes Clydesdale to be the most productive competitive position for Monetalis. I am therefore looking forward to hear more and contribute in any possible way in what is one of the most important initiatives for the Maker community. ",

                    "content": " UPDATE 1 We have spent the past few weeks exploring the possibilities of strategy and investment opportunities etc and can give you some ideas of what we have uncovered and what might be achievable in the short term. We continue to work with CU\u2019s on establishing what would be a reasonable allocation size to an off-chain liquid bond strategy. More to come on that. Overall, our findings of what is achievable today for Maker seem quite positive in our view.  FINDINGS  Operational Structure: Positive Outlook As a starting point we have, in discussion with asset managers, to make the discussions direct and practical, suggested Maker could reuse a structure similar to Monetalis BVI (or other offshore jurisdiction) trust including our selection of bank and trustee etc\u2026 Obviously with appropriate refinement as the \u201cMaker Governance Package\u201d (i.e. role of trustee/attestors/vote etc) gets cleared up. The main sticking points in this structure, in discussing with TradFi institutions, are often origin of capital (i.e. minted DAI/USDC origins etc) and the beneficiary/UBO (MKR holders/MakerDAO), but several seem willing to try and work with this and find practical solutions. We found this a clear positive. It helped substantially that we had actual real parties we could point to from our work in Monetalis with practical operational solutions to reference, and that we could share these with the contacted asset managers. And it very much helped that we could discuss from a \u201cpeer point of view\u201d, as ourselves being a potential RWA vault partner to Maker via our Monetalis Green lending proposal and our time working with the Maker community. These were key aspects, in fact, in getting very practical with the asset managers fast. I suspect the above positive effect are indeed what was, somewhat, predicted by a number of community members in proposing the Arranger model. Hats off to them.  Strategy: Evolving\u2026but picture forming! Here\u2019s a list of the ideas/recommendations from speaking to various asset managers and banks etc. A picture is slowly starting to form, but still more discussions to be had with these parties and with the various interested CU\u2019s.   Barbell strategy best to accomplish liquidity/security/yield in today\u2019s market (late credit cycle) Consistently the suggestion is that to accomplish both yield and liquidity, there needs to be a component that is (fx government bonds) secure, interest-rate sensitive and liquid, but returning close to no yield at this moment - and then another part of the portfolio that is focused on yield in the longer-term (fx corporate bonds of investment grade). Such a strategy may include a diversification mix of maturities, borrower types, geography, theme focus and investment ratings. We are pursuing further evidence of this strategy\u2019s appropriateness. Just for illustration of a Barbell strategy see this picture:  880\u00d7499 24 KB    Multi-Manager focus General expectation is that not one single asset manager would take on the entirety of such a portfolio. It would be multiple. Seems so far a credible concept.   ETF Platform as \u201cBase\u201d General recommendation to gain access to an ETF universe and utilise this as a one of the bases for a strategy. A good set of the funds are reasonably liquid and allow for moving funds between strategies/choices quickly. One could potentially imagine the low risk/liquid end of the barbell to be primarily supported via such an ETF platform.   ESG Every single asset manager we have spoken to has some sort of ESG scoring/evaluation included - just unfortunately generally not in easily comparable formats. How to fit this together from multiple asset managers into a consistent evaluation is to be determined.   Stand-by Bank Credit Line? As we have emphasised the need for liquidity in times of market distress - be that during TradFi or DeFi market distress - the opinion we have heard from several is to develop a credit line with a major bank secured against the portfolio. The reason is that a) markets may close up in a situation of distress and b) moving in and out of portfolios due to short-term market distress could be very costly. As such it may make sense to secure a large bank credit line that can be deployed as needed within hours of need. I think we will explore this further in terms of possibilities and cost.    Investment Partners: High-quality Spectrum Emerging It seems very likely we can have fairly immediate access to the BlackRock ETF universe and relevant analysis instrumentation for strategy design. This illustration below is from 2019, but clearly there is some depth in this universe today - many with strong liquidity profiles. In terms of counterparty risk we think BlackRock scores quite well. Cost of access is an area of key consideration at this moment and we will explore further ASAP. We hope also to immediately start mapping various possible strategies within this universe for consideration and sharing with the community.  1137\u00d7840 134 KB  In addition, we have an increasing set of high-quality asset managers interested in providing part of the solution. We need a bit more work to be able to identify the asset managers and their specific suggestions before sharing with the community, but we can safely say that at least a few of these would certainly qualify as being of the same caliber and standing in the capital markets as BlackRock. To provide you some idea of what is being proposed, one such well-established asset manager (we have not been allowed to share name just yet before further discussions have taken place and certain checks made) provided the following starting point suggestion:  ASSET MANAGER ALPHA \u201c\u2026Our Credentials: Our strength in credit investing lies in the ability to identify the relatively small number of corporate bonds that will outperform the market over a long-term investment horizon. We believe that, over the long term, an issuer\u2019s fundamental resilience will be reflected in the performance of its bonds and will prevail over shorter-term or sentiment-driven market fluctuations. Our in-depth analysis focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of a company\u2019s long-term prospects and genuine diversity, based on deep knowledge of individual companies, allows for thoughtful risk taking. We have various strategies with long-term track records which demonstrate this ability to add value through individual bond selection. Sustainability analysis and ESG has become increasingly important in determining those companies which will thrive and we include as an appendix more details of our approach, which we believe is differentiated from many of our peers. Our Proposal: We believe our strengths align very well with the aims of MakerDAO as we understand them and include, as a core of our proposal, an actively managed long-term credit portfolio. This relatively short-dated and high-quality portfolio would deliver attractive levels of yield to compensate for some mark-to-market volatility. The credit portfolio may satisfy the requirements for the first tranche of collateral but as a complement, if desired, we could also add a carry module which aims to deliver more consistent returns and satisfy more pressing liquidity requirements. Further details are outlined below. A/ Credit module An actively managed portfolio representing our best ideas across global corporate bond markets. A relatively short-dated investment grade portfolio provides a balance of liquidity and low-probability of loss while still offering potential to add value through active credit selection. The current yield of this universe is around 2.3% with a spread above US treasuries of around 0.65%. Further work would be required to explore the most appropriate parameters, but a representative set of characteristics is as follows:     Benchmark ICE BofA 1-5yr US Corp Index     Target +0.75%-1.0% p.a. over rolling 3-year periods   Universe Global, fully hedged to USD   Credit quality Predominantly investment grade, c.20% budget for un-rated and sub-investment grade (mainly subordinated issuance of investment grade companies)   Maturity profile Predominantly short-dated, c.20% budget for > 5 years   Duration flexibility Predominantly short-dated, c.20% budget for > 5 years   Guideline holdings <100 issuers   Derivates Credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, futures     These parameters are based on guidance that MakerDAO would be most comfortable with an investment grade mandate. We would highlight that the traditional divide between investment grade and high yield is perhaps outdated, and there is very little increase in probability of default by moving down to BB-rated securities (but more pronounced moving down to B-rated). Our observation is that the greatest inefficiencies in credit markets exist in the \u2018cross-over\u2019 space covering BBB and BB-rated bonds, and the best opportunities for bond selectors exist when given the freedom to invest across this spectrum. Therefore, we believe the risk-return characteristics of this credit module would be improved if greater flexibility to invest in BB-rated bonds was allowed, say up to 30%. This would also provide more scope to protect against rising inflation. B/ Carry module A broad sub-3 years investment grade corporate bond buy-and-hold portfolio which provides a low-risk solution to enhance yield over cash. This portfolio has the advantage of combatting changes in overall yield environment through frequent re-investment. Liquidity screen and factor risk assessment control universe. A combination of each module could produce an absolute return style mandate with a cash-plus target\u2026.\u201d  We have, of course, answered this proposal with a broad set of questions to understand further - and will facilitate the necessary checks mentioned above - such that more specifics and logic on these proposals can be shared with the community and more comprehensive discussion on the merits of the various proposals can be had. This was purely to provide you with a flavour of the type of ideas we are receiving from asset managers today.  Observations/Questions etc During the conversations we also experienced a number of questions and observations we are still processing, but list them here for conversation in short-form in no particular order:   Benchmarks? What to meet? What to beat? Across portfolio? Per strategy? Per asset manager? Index? Absolute?   How liquid? How big a liquidation discount is acceptable? Need cash within hours? Within days? Within weeks? Months? How big a percentage of the portfolio for each time category? And how big a loss willing to suffer for liquidity at each stage, if any?   Short-term mark-to-market volatility on long-term holdings? Appetite-level?   USD vs Non-USD hedged exposures? Appetite-level?   Investment-grade rating constraints vs dislocations in rating? Several asset managers point to exploitable credit inefficiency in cross-over space between BBB (IG) and BB (non-IG) - i.e. extra yield for limited lift in default probability. Appetite-level? (well illustrated in the example asset manager proposal above)   How to think about inflation in the portfolio?    Project Clydesdale Expected Outcome - as it is evolving now: So far, it looks like we should be able to develop, fairly fast, a flexible and scalable platform with broad access to the global bond markets via the ETF universe as well as directly to high-quality asset managers. This means a few things:   Multiple different strategies, with community support, can be executed on this platform   Asset Managers can be onboarded/off-boarded as determined by the community.   Given the scalability of this platform, it should, as far as I can tell, be able to support any levels of increased demands for DAI supply, only constrained by the size of the USD/DAI liquidity market.   Similarly, the platform should be able to support a temporary DAI \u201csell-off\u201d with liquidity to buy DAI in a cost-efficient and time-sensitive manner - via potentially a credit line, ETF liquidations and ultimately asset manager position sales.   In short, Maker, this way, would be somewhat equipped as would usually a large life insurer or pension-fund in terms of asset access and be able to execute most ALM strategies via this. As such there is little direct innovation in the platform - the innovation will lie in the chosen strategies to executed on the platform to support an innovative ALM strategy. Hopefully, the establishment of this platform, can allow the community to focus much effort on the more innovative and impactful real-world-asset situations that aren\u2019t available within the traditional investment universe expressed on this emerging platform.

                    "content": "Thank you for your answer @Allan_Pedersen. Me, and the rest of the community, are looking forward to hear more about your dual strategy. With limited resources and a wide range of action, I believe that a clear strategy will need to be provided to the community. I am particularly interested on your points about structuring. For what regards investment strategy, I believe that such decision should be left to the product factory, i.e. the asset manager, and not to the structuring intermediary. We are not inventing anything on the investment side. Large and reputable asset managers help financial and corporate institutions manage their treasury book every day. Maker, however, has a very peculiar structure and liquidity requirements that would require specialised structuring intermediaries (like Monetalis wants to become) and ALM analysts (we are seeing this attempt for specialisation happening within the Strategic Finance CU). Luckily, given the size of our liquid USDC-centred treasury book, I believe we can start implementing a solution and scale it up to a certain point without incurring in liquidity constraint. I am curious about the proposal from the asset manager but I am also nervous. A treasury portfolio should not, in principle, carry significant credit risk and a cross-over proposal IG-HY to squeeze a few bps of yield I believe doesn\u2019t go in the direction of reserve diversification and yield improvement that an initial treasury portfolio should have. Summarising, I am looking forward to hear more but I would like to understand what is Monetalis position exactly, because I am confused. Is Monetalis?   A structurer, meaning that will provide the structure to Maker to access reputable asset managers remaining agnostic on strategy and partner?  An intermediary meaning that will provide structure but also onboard the partners  An asset manager itself meaning that it will ask for some level discretion in putting together the strategic and tactical asset allocation based on which the partners will behave  I believe those jobs to be fairly different. Whether the role of structurer/ intermediary could indeed have significant cross-overs across asset classes, being the discretion mainly at the asset manager level (below), the role of discretionary asset manager has very little scalability (unless Monetalis structure involves 100 people and a battle-tested tech platform) across rates and credit. Alternative credit origination, especially, is very time consuming even for a mere aggregator of existing platforms. Differently to what happens for listed securities, platform-originated credit is less standardised, presents spurious data, is very idiosyncratic when it comes to credit policies and quality of execution, and even being an aggregator of existing platforms requires a lot of work and man power. As a benchmark, large alternative credit originating platforms in Europe (I can provide examples if asked) that originate 500m of new loans per year are i) regulated by ECB/ local central banks, ii) have staff ranging between 50 and 100 people, iii) have spent several 10s of MM on proprietary tech platforms, iv) have at least 5 years of history - onboarding an originator typically requires 6 months of work, even before scaling deployment. Looking forward to continue the conversation. As the SES-incubated lead of the Lending Oversight CU I am working closely with RWF on the credit risk and structuring side of the equation, but based on experience and interest (and impact) I remain deeply interested on the evolution of our treasury management strategies as well.

Me, and the rest of the community, are looking forward to hear more about your dual strategy.  Sure! Of course. It will come shortly as promised.  With limited resources and a wide range of action, I believe that a clear strategy will need to be provided to the community.  I think you will find that, in practice, things are perhaps not as resource intensive as you imagine, but I will explain shortly - all as promised  I am particularly interested on your points about structuring.  Sure - I will include something on that in the update. You can also speak to @christiancdpetersen  - on these matters we are usually well aligned.  For what regards investment strategy, I believe that such decisions should be left to the product factory, i.e. the asset manager, and not to the structuring intermediary.  I do not believe I have ever said anything about Monetalis deciding any strategy if you are thinking about us as intermediary in your statement - in fact I believe I have made it crystal clear that the community must decide the strategy. And on whether the asset manager or the community decides strategy, well, that depends on what level of strategy you are talking about. Let\u2019s say we wish to deploy an asset allocation strategy using the BlackRock iShares ETF universe - each iShares product has their own strategy. The picture below shows a few fixed income ESG Aware iShares - each with their distinct fixed income strategy:  1600\u00d7767 163 KB  So, obviously, nobody can have any impact on any of these individual iShares internal strategies - they are entirely in the hands of BlackRock. But choosing which of these above 7 strategies to buy into and how much to allocate into each - well that is - and should be - entirely in the hands of the community - and it should be driven by analysis of the liability side requirements and ultimately risk/return appetite of the community. We should of course ask advice from the asset managers (all advice is always welcome!) and ask them to run analysis on the possible asset allocation scenarios to understand potential/most likely behaviour in risk/return/volatility etc. That is essential. With other asset managers that allow customised strategies (such as Asset Manager A in the example), the community can be deeper involved in selecting more elements of the individual theme/category strategy (how much to allocate to IG rated vs non-rated - max Duration above 5y etc). Again - the asset manager must provide advice and analysis around these choices, but, ultimately, the decision will lie with the community on how to allocate and select. Maker has a unique liability side - that allows us to build a strategic advantage in thinking creatively about how to support it with an equally unique asset side. Proper ALM thinking must become a key focus and be built into a strategic advantage of Maker. It will prove us to be prudent in the eyes of regulators, will allow us to generate more yield, will allow us to build new DAI-based products etc etc. Done right, ALM will be an exceptionally strong competitive advantage that can fuel profitable growth of Maker. So Maker cannot resonably outsource, ultimately, these choices - but we should always be happy to gain advice and analysis from as many sources as possible - this can only lead the community to make better informed choices.  We are not inventing anything on the investment side. Large and reputable asset managers help financial and corporate institutions manage their treasury book every day.  Agreed.  Maker, however, has a very peculiar structure and liquidity requirements that would require specialised structuring intermediaries (like Monetalis wants to become) and ALM analysts (we are seeing this attempt for specialisation happening within the Strategic Finance CU).  As mentioned above, there are indeed uniquenesses that need to be deliberately turned into a competitive advantage - the sooner, the better.  Luckily, given the size of our liquid USDC-centred treasury book, I believe we can start implementing a solution and scale it up to a certain point without incurring in liquidity constraint.  I agree, but now is not the time for personal opinions or speculation. We need data and analysis from Risk and Strategic Finance (\u2026and it is in the works as far as I understand!) to support an asset allocation strategy and decision. This sort of asset allocation needs to start having a science, analysis and data based grounding - or we will for sure get it wrong as Maker grows further and faster.  I am curious about the proposal from the asset manager but I am also nervous. A treasury portfolio should not, in principle, carry significant credit risk and a cross-over proposal IG-HY to squeeze a few bps of yield I believe doesn\u2019t go in the direction of reserve diversification and yield improvement that an initial treasury portfolio should have.  Here our views on the risk absorption capacity of the balance sheet may divert, but, as above, this is not the time for personal opinions or speculation. It is time for establishing data and analysis on the subject such that the community can make an informed science and data-based decision.  Summarising, I am looking forward to hear more but I would like to understand what is Monetalis position exactly, because I am confused. Is Monetalis?  A structurer, meaning that will provide the structure to Maker to access reputable asset managers remaining agnostic on strategy and partner? An intermediary meaning that will provide structure but also onboard the partners An asset manager itself meaning that it will ask for some level discretion in putting together the strategic and tactical asset allocation based on which the partners will behave   I will make clear shortly what we are - I don\u2019t want people to be confused of course! It is a longer write and so please do give me some days. But, generally speaking, be very wary of trying to put innovative initiatives around MakerDAO into conventional boxes - it won\u2019t work. Remember MakerDAO doesn\u2019t fit any conventional box - and in fact this redesign of the financial system\u2019s value chain boxes is part of its (and DeFi\u2019s you could say) emerging success - it is a new box unto itself.  I believe those jobs to be fairly different. Whether the role of structurer/ intermediary could indeed have significant cross-overs across asset classes, being the discretion mainly at the asset manager level (below), the role of discretionary asset manager has very little scalability (unless Monetalis structure involves 100 people and a battle-tested tech platform) across rates and credit.  So for what we are doing we certainly won\u2019t need that many people for a very long time to come - and most tech we need, for now, is in overabundant Saas supply - but more on that later.  Alternative credit origination, especially, is very time consuming even for a mere aggregator of existing platforms. Differently to what happens for listed securities, platform-originated credit is less standardised, presents spurious data, is very idiosyncratic when it comes to credit policies and quality of execution, and even being an aggregator of existing platforms requires a lot of work and man power. As a benchmark, large alternative credit originating platforms in Europe (I can provide examples if asked) that originate 500m of new loans per year are i) regulated by ECB/ local central banks, ii) have staff ranging between 50 and 100 people, iii) have spent several 10s of MM on proprietary tech platforms, iv) have at least 5 years of history - onboarding an originator typically requires 6 months of work, even before scaling deployment.  Agreed. This is why, as you know from our MIP6 on Monetalis, we are doing senior secured wholesale lending to non-bank lenders focused on unregulated SME lending - and stay far away from platform-originated credit and pure credit origination in general - platform-originated credit has proven reasonably hopeless to manage - many wholesale lenders got in trouble trying to work with these platforms when they were particularly \u201cin vogue\u201d - and pure origination businesses can take a lot of time to scale, require a lot of risky investments, and often doesn\u2019t actually become as successful as one might have hoped. A pure originator business of the kind I think you are alluding to would, usually, have a revenue model focused primarily on origination fees and some equity lending capital exposure margin. Wholesale lenders, like Monetalis, are more akin to an investment manager with revenue solely from % of AuM fees plus profit-share. With Monetalis we\u2019d grow, over 8 to 12 months, to work with a total of around 10 or so lenders to deploy USD 400M - and we\u2019d need about 10 to 15 people over time, to run efficiently and safely the whole operation - a bit larger team than what is market norm, but we want be sure we are equipped to scale further and appropriately support Green Economy underwriting. If wholesale lending required many more people, nobody would be doing this business today in the UK - the maths simply wouldn\u2019t stack up: 1% mgmt fee @ 400M = 4M USD is not going to hire a lot of people and pay for much operations and necessary, substantive, services required (legal, structures, audits, accounting, banking, IT etc). Yes, there is also a profit-sharing component, but that is rarely considered to add much in any cost base evaluation - as it is largely variable. With 10 to 15 employees, this is not the best AuM/person situation - I am not too happy about it I\u2019ll admit. In estimation, by our insider sources, Conister Bank has about 5 people running a growing non-bank SME wholesale lending book of GBP500M+ and Hampshire Trust Bank has a similar GBP200M+ book growing with even fewer staff. Obviously they use their general bank infrastructure for a few things and so you could allocate a few more FTE to their operations, but not many. Anyhow, we accept starting a bit over-staffed compared to industry to ensure we can scale with Maker. As we have so many senior staff with 15y/20y+ experience in industry who knows exactly what is ineffecient in todays wholesale lending processes, we built our own IT helping us to be more efficient (as many of these wholesale lenders are still reasonably paper-based in their processes) and we may invest a bit more in that over this year, but that is only say 500K or a bit more - it is just a wholesale lending onboarding, admin, monitoring and reporting system on AWS. In terms of onboarding lenders, I\u2019d say from first intro meeting to signing facility letter and first dollar out in senior secure loan we are talking about 3 months. Luckily we have a sizable pipeline and several of them are at various stage into this 3 months process so deployment can start very fast.  Looking forward to continue the conversation. As the SES-incubated lead of the Lending Oversight CU I am working closely with RWF on the credit risk and structuring side of the equation, but based on experience and interest (and impact) I remain deeply interested on the evolution of our treasury management strategies as well.  Of course. We look forward to engaging with all the CU\u2019s and the community on these things. ",

                    "content": "Thank you @Allan_Pedersen, will continue in a similar fashion.     Allan_Pedersen:  I think you will find that, in practice, things are perhaps not as resource intensive as you imagine, but I will explain shortly - all as promised   Looking forward. And I agree with you we should try to tackle his proposed initiative in isolation.     Allan_Pedersen:  Sure - I will include something on that in the update. You can also speak to @christiancdpetersen - on these matters we are usually well aligned.   Thank you. @christiancdpetersen and myself speak multiple times a day so I am sure he is supporting you in the most professional way possible for the DAO.     Allan_Pedersen:  I do not believe I have ever said anything about Monetalis deciding any strategy if you are thinking about us as intermediary in your statement - in fact I believe I have made it crystal clear that the community must decide the strategy. And on whether the asset manager or the community decides strategy, well, that depends on what level of strategy you are talking about. Let\u2019s say we wish to deploy an asset allocation strategy using the BlackRock iShares ETF universe - each iShares product has their own strategy. The picture below shows a few fixed income ESG Aware iShares - each with their distinct fixed income strategy:   Thank you for this. I tend to agree with you. Ultimately, the most important thing is that we collaborate with professionals, as manage a book of 100s of MM or BB is sensitive and more complex than it appears, even in an asset class as liquid as IG bonds or Govies. I agree with you that we should explore the whole spectrum, including a portfolio of ETFs or maybe a dedicated tailored mandate by an AM. I believe a dedicated mandate would be higher quality, better tailored, and more remunerative as we have the size to do that, but it\u2019s just a semi-qualified opinion and looking forward to engage managers on this topic. What I want to ensure is tha, even if we are going towards the \u2018ETF portfolio way\u2019 we collaborate with a reputable, institutional, and regulated counterpart rather than leaving the book management to sub-par intermediaries. I read from your comments that you agree with me on this topic so looking forward to hear more. Again, I believe Maker-savvy intermediaries like Monetalis can be incredibly helpful if you guys get the structure and governance right.     Allan_Pedersen:  I agree, but now is not the time for personal opinions or speculation. We need data and analysis from Risk and Strategic Finance (\u2026and it is in the works as far as I understand!) to support an asset allocation strategy and decision. This sort of asset allocation needs to start having a science, analysis and data based grounding - or we will for sure get it wrong as Maker grows further and faster.   Fully agree.     Allan_Pedersen:  Here our views on the risk absorption capacity of the balance sheet may divert, but, as above, this is not the time for personal opinions or speculation. It is time for establishing data and analysis on the subject such that the community can make an informed science and data-based decision.   Agree. Constructive and open conversation is the way.     Allan_Pedersen:  I will make clear shortly what we are - I don\u2019t want people to be confused of course! It is a longer write and so please do give me some days. But, generally speaking, be very wary of trying to put innovative initiatives around MakerDAO into conventional boxes - it won\u2019t work. Remember MakerDAO doesn\u2019t fit any conventional box - and in fact this redesign of the financial system\u2019s value chain boxes is part of its (and DeFi\u2019s you could say) emerging success - it is a new box unto itself.   Yes, but up to a certain point. I think we must not disregard professionalism and experience, otherwise we will ultimately make huge mistakes that should be avoided based on the checks and balances learned through decades of portable experience.     Allan_Pedersen:  Agreed. This is why, as you know from our MIP6 on Monetalis, we are doing senior secured wholesale lending to non-bank lenders focused on unregulated SME lending - and stay far away from platform-originated credit and pure credit origination in general - platform-originated credit has proven reasonably hopeless to manage - many wholesale lenders got in trouble trying to work with these platforms when they were particularly \u201cin vogue\u201d - and pure origination businesses can take a lot of time to scale, require a lot of risky investments, and often doesn\u2019t actually become as successful as one might have hoped.   Here I disagree. Complexity, resources required, time required, tech required, don\u2019t change. A non-bank lender is a platform. I believe, based on my deep experience in the space, that onboarding and working with 10 non-bank lenders would require years to set up a proper onboarding, shadow rating / monitoring team, data polishing team / track record. I can qualify my statements, and will ask top mezzanine/ credit investors in the UK to support my concerns with official opinions. I believe a comparison with Banks doesn\u2019t stack well as they rely on several internal resources. I have worked closely, in my career in the UK, with professionals from Blackstone, KKR, Apollo, Ares, HIG, Metric, CrossLend, Banco BNI, Varengold - I will be happy to engage to show how difficult it is to do this at scale. Specifically, I would feel much more comfortable to have this type of institution providing mezzanine financing ahead of the Maker facility as it would give a lot of strength to your beliefs. But I will stick to the Clydesdale proposal here, a proposal I see crucial for the Maker ecosystem and that I am looking forward to discuss further with the rest of the community. ",

                    "content": "Dear Maker Community, We have reworked the Project Clydesdale MIP substantially to make it more practical and execution focused. We\u2019d like to make a few comments on the ideas behind our rework: As we have worked through Project Clydesdale (and MIP6/MIP68: Monetalis \u201cGreen\u201d), it has become clear that we should reasonably be able to implement a satisfactory solution with some speed: Several components are close to finalisation, and the path to finalising missing parts either requires starting the actual execution or specific reasonably well-defined short-lived CU interaction/work/review. To sum up the status quo:     Component Status Quo of Components Principal CU     Structural Almost ready/ready components Trust structure (BVI) Maker off/on-chain Gov concept Banking/Custody/Segregated account Trustee & instruction mechanics  RWF/LTS   Asset Strategy Almost ready/ready offers of strategies:A BlackRock ETF based strategy Baillie Gifford customised bond strategy Goldman Sachs customised strategy  SF   Technical MIP21 based solution CES    Please note that this MIP is not skipping any review steps, but designed for quick collaboration:  Verification required from RWF/LTS on the satisfactory nature of the structure (legal etc) Verification required from SF on the satisfactory nature of the asset strategy We work through the technical implementation as CES directs & coordinates \u2026and it all ends in an executive vote in c4  And, of course, along the way, the Maker community will be kept \u201cin the loop\u201d and potential decisions/compromises debated etc - as always with Maker. I would also like you to clearly understand that before this executive vote in c4, we have to implement everything physically and potentially iterate on it. I.e. we are moving beyond just legal and technical advice and into setting up trust, accounts, trustee services, agreements with asset managers etc, because we can\u2019t establish all the details without this practical chain of execution (for instance: trustee won\u2019t engage before seeing real instructions and final trust agreement, bank won\u2019t truly finalise KYC and fees before seeing trust setup, asset manager won\u2019t finalise and set fees etc before bank and trust in place etc etc). Such that the final executive vote won\u2019t be on a theoretical model or intentions/expectations, but on something that is practically operational. In short, we believe we can implement reasonably fast on a starting USDC reallocation to a bond strategy developed and executed by a top-tier counterparty, in practice. But of course it requires some work and prioritisation from relevant CU\u2019s. We propose, with this MIP, to the MKR holders, that this project is worthy of priority and pace - and set out an attempt at a mechanism that communicates this priority to the community: the non-MIP onboarding blocking mechanism. The non-MIP onboarding block: prioritisation & motivation The non-MIP onboarding block in c1 is a new mechanism. It is an attempt at introducing a strong and reliable decentralised prioritisation mechanism that is intended to ensure that a proposal, ready for fast execution, cannot be easily ignored once the community has approved it with the full authority of the MIP process, as it requires a signal request (c5) process to unblock. It is, of course, important that the community only agree to this type of strong prioritisation for projects that are of substance, well prepared to move through the onboarding steps in the MIP and have the ability to do so at pace (a condition we believe we can satisfy). As the block is certainly not intended to be a lengthy one. If this method proves successful, it could set a strong precedent that projects that are willing and able to do the necessary detailed preparatory work themselves and marshall the resources to quickly more through an onboarding, rather than heavily relying on the CU\u2019s to do all the work, will have a process available to them that ensures all the work they have put in, and resources they are willing to allocated towards this onboarding, are worth it. We believe this would be attractive to a number of larger RWA collateral onboarders/Larger TradFi players, and generally help motivate RWA onboarders to add more investments into creating complete, larger RWA proposals and allocate resources that might allow them to deploy using this process. Taking this path could, eventually, also help alleviate the bottleneck on RWA onboarding by making the process significantly more decentralised, as this process should, as mentioned above, motivate larger RWA onboarding projects to start taking more independent responsibility for their onboarding, rather than expecting others to do the work and carry them through.

Apologies if I am front running your explanation regarding the prioritisation enforcement described in MIP65c1, however I feel that this enforcement would be better placed within a collateral onboarding process as opposed to within the collateral onboarding project itself. Prioritisation should explicitly call out what is being prioritised (and therefore what is not) so collateral candidates can be assessed, measured, ranked and categorised within a common framework - it\u2019s a much wider discussion with broader implications - many of which can be run in parallel, but would get lost in within a single collateral proposal.

Overall, collateral onboarded to the Maker protocol has a smart contract, risk, and oracle assessment. This provides the community with the in-depth information to allow the community to be informed and vote in an on-chain poll.

The intention is to use the authority of the MIP process to give voters an option to guarantee that high impact collateral onboardings - that can deploy large debt ceiling and where all the pieces are already in place and just need to be executed - can be prioritized and onboarded instantly after the MIP vote. This should be possible based on the ability of MIPs to dictate the contents of executive votes, by both specifying the exact risk parameters of the collateral to be onboarded, and preventing executive votes of other collateral onboardings that have not been similar specified through a MIP. This way, the game theory means that everyone involved will work together to perform the onboardings even if their primary objective is to onboard something else, since finishing the onboarding of the collateral that has been prioritized at the MIP level opens up for the onboarding of other things. I think Robert makes some good points about the language here, though. It actually isn\u2019t 100% clear that this is guaranteed to supersede all other collateral onboardings, and by not recognising the established collateral onboarding process risks damaging it. I will suggest some edits that would help provide stronger guarantees. A crucial requirement is that the voters are careful to set the precedent that this type of MIP can only be approved for projects that do in fact have a significant impact with high debt ceiling and guaranteed demand for credit that will go towards quality collateral, and on top of that have an airtight legal structure that make it maximally secure to transfer large amounts of Dai into it, while following MIP21 on the technical which is a simple implementation that has already been proven to work, meaning it can be directly copied with no R&D requirements. It should only be used carefully, since misuse could result in clogging up the entire collateral onboarding process and forcing the community to deal with a cancellation, but the key is then to make sure that anyone that ends up having to be cancelled will have their reputation ruined and should never expect to be able to onboard collateral again ",

Given that you\u2019re suggesting this type of MIPs are presented through this channel due to their high impact and ready-to-go form, has this ready-to-go form been assessed or reviewed by anyone else that doesn\u2019t represent the applicant? Since the beginning of my involvement as prospective facilitator of a Lending Oversight core unit, I have been trying to introduce in the DAO the importance of proper checks and balances. I can\u2019t speak for the technical requirements that @monkey.irish\u2019s team would address, but on the legal structure, has @christiancdpetersen (as prospective facilitator of a LTS core unit and current support for the DAO) or any other independent legal advisor reviewed the structure and offered an official legal opinion on its merits? Also, to @monkey.irish point, I\u2019m uncertain about the applicability of the self-contained prioritisation against any other MIP type. Would that mean that the community is forced to ultimately find an implementation solution putting otherwise the protocol in a de facto stalling situation for new improvements? Doesn\u2019t this transform the MIP65 into a gatekeeper of the rest of the development flow, basically stripping out from the appointed CUs a big part of their mandate when it comes to recommending implementation only if the technical, risk, and legal conditions arise? More practically, a great idea that receives a favourable vote might ultimately turn impractical for mere technical yet very important reasons. What would happen in this case? I have no doubts on the professional stance of the Monetalis team or its shareholders. The reasons I am addressing this, is that we believe that if a MIP is presented for urgent and immediate implementation, its merits and especially structural appropriateness should be assessed by a legally bound third party or, ideally, the CUs that have been voted for this within the DAO. If a counterweight is not present, it feels that those types of MIPs are too similar to the Fast-Track process that was voted down recently through a Signal. Apologies if I\u2019m missing something, I am sure Governance and others will be able to clarify the boundaries of those MIPs. ",

What would happen in this case?   This is a key point, and basically what I tried to explain here.  It should only be used carefully, since misuse could result in clogging up the entire collateral onboarding process and forcing the community to deal with a cancellation, but the key is then to make sure that anyone that ends up having to be cancelled will have their reputation ruined and should never expect to be able to onboard collateral again  The MIP itself has a check (in c2 under verification) that would in this case practically require Christian (through Will as the facilitator) to verify that the actual implemented structure indeed provides the protections that it should. This can only be truly done after the structures are in place - it\u2019s not enough to review the plan and the intended structure, because you can never be sure what is actually created is what was claimed or planned before the fact. So Monetalis have in advance checked with Christian and others that the structure they plan to put in place are appropriate. Monetalis then makes the proposal, and if they get the go ahead signal, that would enable them to pull the trigger and pay the expenses of setting up the structures. Then the structures would be set up and the final verification of the de facto structure can be performed. If the proposer didn\u2019t check with professionals and/or mandated actors beforehand, or if they try to implement something different from what they promise to, then the MIP just breaks the collateral onboarding process, and must be manually cancelled through a signal request - which is going to ruin the reputation and political capital of the proposer. For an arranger such as Monetalis that is a death sentence and a risk they are certain to do everything possible to avoid. There\u2019s one more crucial element that I realize we need to add, which is the possibility of the proposer to unilaterally and instantly cancel the onboarding, which would be the only way for them to salvage their reputation if it turns out an onboarding wasn\u2019t actually \u201cready to go\u201d after all, but it was due to an honest mistake. The goal is that we use game theory to ensure only actual high quality proposal would ever dare to risk making a MIP-level onboarding, so it becomes a filter that ensures that it will always be worth it for the community to deeply scrutinize collateral onboarding proposals that are made in the form of a self contained MIP. The recent HVB proposal arranged by RWA co is another example of a very high value collateral onboarding proposal that IMO also should be done with a MIP level onboarding, IMO, without being an expert, it is simply too valuable to not provide a guarantee directly from maker governance that it will be swiftly onboarded if it is verified. that all the structures and legal guarantees have been put in place, and verified that the structure is restricted to only acquire assets at the level of quality Maker demands.

Having a clear and transparent prioritization process is key to any future onboarding process.

While that may or may not lead to agreement, at least the community will understand the reasons why collateral gets onboarded. My goal is to iterate on the process to ensure it works. One-off work shows me something isn\u2019t working. With the current proposed MIPs and SRs, it\u2019s clear to me that the front end of the onboarding process isn\u2019t working.

Next week in our alignment meetings, we\u2019ll start to rollout improvements to the process and this will quickly materialize into increased communications with the community. If this stuff was easy, we would have done it already. Working within a DAO has its own challenges and there is overhead present that isn\u2019t in a centralized organization.

                    "content": "Hi Allan In general I am a fan of proposals that aim to address the large amount of USDC in the system while pursuing added revenue for the Maker Protocol. I do have one important question though: How do you intend to deal with an unplanned Emergency Shutdown scenario? If you are not familiar with the mechanics, Maker Governance can trigger Emergency Shutdown which will settle the protocol e.g. in case there is a bug or governance attack. You can read more about it here and here. The TL;DR is that the protocol will automatically settle all vaults and Dai tokens will become redeemable for a relative share of the underlying collateral in the system. Using today\u2019s data, that would mean that each Dai would be redeemable for 54 cents worth of USDC, 22 cents worth of ETH, 6 cents of WBTC and etc. as illustrated below. (See daistats for a real time distribution).  Since this MIP proposes using MIP21 for the technical solution the representation of collateral onchain is a \u201cdummy\u201d RWA token that in itself does not have any market value and from a technical point of view does not constitute any claim on the underlying collateral which is offchain in the real world. To illustrate an example, if there is a total Dai supply of 10 billion, and this MIP65 vault has generated 500 M Dai (maxed out the proposed debt ceiling, accounting for 5 % of total supply). If emergency shutdown is triggered, this means that 5 % (5 cent) of the value of each Dai will be attributed to this RWA token, and will be distributed to Dai redeemers accordingly. So Dai holders upon redemption will now be given a bunch of RWA tokens, however the problem is that these tokens in itself do not constitute any claim on the underlying real world assets, and as such does not have an organic market value, as you cannot sell it off in any exchange such as Uniswap. So my question is, how will Dai holders be made whole in such a scenario? Will you be committed to buy back the RWA tokens from Dai redeemers? If there is no path to redeem or sell off the RWA tokens in case of emergency shutdown it would mean a 5 % value haircut for all Dai holders after ES, meaning that Dai would actually be valued at 0.95 USD in the example above, rather than 1.00 USD, as they would not be able to sell off the redeemed RWA tokens in the market. In all fairness this is an issue that exists with existing RWA vaults as well, however the magnitude of the proposed debt ceiling for this vault increases the problem almost 10-fold, where today the max RWA exposure would be at 59M which today would mean about 0.6 % of each Dai being backed by RWA vs potentially 5 %. CES have done some preliminary work on designing a solution that would deal with this issue by continuing MIP21-type RWA loans after emergency shutdown and facilitate gradual payback to holders of the RWA tokens, however from an implementation standpoint it is still early. Whatever the process might be, I think the DAO should have a well defined plan upfront for such a scenario. ",

There might be some KYC issues but in practice this just means that large entities that are able to pass strict KYC will buy up all the dai and then deal with the settlement. I also have some old designs for more advanced and smoother solutions that could be used in the long run, the most interesting being that RWA vaults simply \u201cswitch recognition\u201d to a new Maker deployment and the Dai from that deployment is then eligible to claim by dai holders with their dai in claim mode. IMO the most important thing is that the solution must be entirely on the legal side. There is nothing to gain from adding more complexity on the technical side, because the ability to access the assets is fundamentally driven by a legal structure and will only work if it\u2019s properly enforced through legal means.

Just to put some more colour on this: the bond strategies we are looking at are tasked to liquidate to cash very fast, and then exchange to USDC or other relevant stablecoin in case of the emergency shutdown you mention - or directly to DAI in case the liquidation request is made for the purpose of providing liquidity in response to a DAI crisis. We are currently stress testing liquidation patterns for market conditions and price consequences for various bond strategies so we can understand the dynamics hereof. As an example here\u2019s a quote from a recent report on a customized bond strategy for Maker from one of the asset managers we are working with (and this is not the ETF-based strategy or the most liquid of the strategies we are testing out - but this one captured some reasonable yield and remained within investment grade and short term duration constraints, and so we wanted to understand its liquidity pattern):  \u2026we typically test our credit portfolios assuming 40% market capture with a price tolerance of no more than 1% above current mid-bid spreads. On this basis 99% of a $500m portfolio could be liquidated within a day in current market conditions. If we tighten the price impact to 0.25% then 78% could be liquidated within a day and 90% within 3 days\u2026  On top of all this we are also looking to potentially setup a credit line (secured on the portfolio) that would allow us to get cash immediately without disturbing the portfolio or, at least, give the portfolio time to liquidate orderly (markets can dry entirely out in times of broad financial crisis) More on this to very soon. As you can imagine, ultimately one needs to come down on some appropriate combination of liquidity pattern/underlying risk/mark-to-market volatility/yield/etc that works for Maker. ",

The process involves a set of verification requirements and a process \u201chand-brake\u201d (signal) that can be pulled at any time - before the onboarding is up for a final executive vote. All details, as a result of the verification processes, will be known and discussed before this final executive vote. We believe we can get this onboarding done fast - elements not complete yet require moving into the practical implementation to settle, which we know we can do at pace. I am entirely committed to using the unilateral withdrawal mechanism in this MIP, in the unlikely and unexpected event that something slows down the verification and onboarding process. If we cannot get the promised pace into this onboarding, I will withdraw it immediately. As such, this MIP will neither lead to an inappropriate collateral being onboarded nor clog up the onboarding process. It has checks and triggers in it to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen. Instead it should lead to an appropriate, priority collateral being onboarded quickly. I also hope that learnings from this onboarding could inform the process and prioritisation mechanism changes that I know CES is working on - work we absolutely support. ",

                    "content": "Wouldn\u2019t the easiest way just be to put into a legal agreement that the borrower is committed to buy back any fraction of RWA tokens, using a simple order book exchange like OasisDEX? In standard MIP21, there\u2019s a singular RWA token (RWA-00X), which in this case would be valued at 500 M. In case of ES, Monetalis could then set up a buy order for the entire supply (1 RWA token) at 500 M USDC, that would allow users to redeem their tokens. Another approach I\u2019ve been thinking about is simply turning the RWA tokens into a bond like instrument post ES. This would mean that we could continue the loan agreement, but that the repayment of Dai would happen to another module that would allow RWA token holders to redeem at a maturity date for the principal + yield. In case there was a redeployment of the Maker Protocol, those yield generating tokens could be onboarded as collateral with a corresponding stability fee, meaning that the yield would then go to a new surplus buffer instead, effectively meaning the loan was migrated to the new system. I think in the case of ES it would actually be good to have a mechanism to continue the loans because in that scenario having a potential steady income for the DAO would be beneficial in ensuring its continued operations. I agree that it should be fairly simple to do to setup a process, I just think it would be good to establish this concrete process upfront of how a Dai holder would redeem their tokens, because depending on the process there are different operational requirements and risks. If the process does indeed require KYC it would be good to understand the process and have an idea of the types of market participatents, to understand if the process will be competitive and efficient. E.g. in the extreme case that only a singular actor goes through the KYC process for a specific underlying asset (either they are the only one eligible, or the only one that bothers), they would have a monopoly on the market for redeeming RWA tokens and can dictate the price, which would lead to a large haircut. To me this is also a broader discussion of the sunk costs of preparing for Emergency Shutdown. This is something that engineers spend a lot of time on, yet it is arguable how confident we are that this mechanism will work as intended in practice, as bugs are still being discovered, and as the system increases in complexity and becomes more intertwined with other protocols is very hard to properly simulate. However if we do not design for it, we are also basically abandoning the function. So either we prepare for ES properly from both a technical and operational POV so we know it\u2019s a viable mechanic, or we effectively abandon it. I\u2019m not really for or against either option, but we shouldn\u2019t keep investing in something unless we know it is going to work. ",

It\u2019s a good question to be worked on and understood but based on the fact that other RWA don\u2019t formally address the issue, it seems like a separate issue to be thought through.  Am I right in my understanding that it just boils down to how you liquidate and pay out to the protocol while maximizing speed and value with the consequence of not having this thoroughly addressed being the inability to maximize speed and value in the off chance that ES is triggered?  It sounds like there is a lot of work being put toward liquidation events anyway and my view is that the cost of delaying approval may be more than what you gain in taking too much time solving this problem.  Maybe I\u2019m underestimating the worst case scenario of an emergency shutdown here but I get the sense that the bond values would not suffer huge impact and dai holders should eventually retain most of the value they\u2019re promised.

                    "content": "I would like to thank @Allan_Pedersen and the Monetalis team for this proposal. I am writing the following as prospective facilitator of the Lending Oversight Core Unit, consistent with the mandate to act protecting good internal checks and balances, and as a second internal line of defence for what concerns structured lending risk, in it\u2019s wide sense.  On the Proposal\u2019s Intentions As I have discussed previously, and consistent with the view expressed by @SebVentures above, I believe there is great merit in what Clydesdale\u2019s intends to achieve. The deployment of part of the USDC treasury we have is a crucial problem that we need to address in the immediate future, as there are many ways to improve its counterparty risk profile while optimising the deriving yield. Some of the Core Units (Growth, RWF, Strategic Finance, incubated LTS and LOVE, and others) have been facilitating conversations with reputable asset managers that are expressing their desire to explore potential collaborations with the protocol for this reason, but a multiple track where several proponents are exploring potential solutions is advisable. For this reason, I endorse personally Allan\u2019s efforts. In its ideal form the proposal should have minimum embedded credit risk and therefore should fall more within the domain of @strat-fin-core-unit rather than @Real-World-Finance, with liquidity being the overarching concern. I am saying in its ideal form, because it isn\u2019t yet clear what will be the mandate in its detail; for this reason I would envisage both @Aes and @williamr to engage with Monetalis and team to define a detailed mandate ahead of implementation.  On Monetalis as the Proponent Monetalis has proven to be very entrepreneurial in their intentions, fast to respond to the challenges, and very close to the community. This is of great value. Currently, Monetalis has two MIPs outstanding, MIP65 on liquid bonds (this MIP) and MIP68 on a credit vault (here). Both initiatives are extremely new and will have significant challenges. Although I understand from the Monetalis\u2019 team that both will have significant structuring challenges, I am against endorsing simultaneously two very different strategies to be run by the same intermediary and both as a first mandate, and I would be significantly more comfortable with Monetalis deciding which one to prioritise first I will try to describe my concerns:  The role of lender and liquid asset allocator are very different and difficult to implement in sync. There are two alternative mental models we could see Monetalis through, the 1st one is considering Monetalis as a full fledged asset management, that underwrites risk internally and takes directional execution on those risks (the Asset Manager model), the 2nd one is considering Monetalis as an outsourced investment office or intermediary working with other asset managers (the Asset Allocator model). In case Monetalis sees itself as an Asset Manager, I believe that it is premature for a lender or investor like MakerDAO to endorse two very distinctive strategies simultaneously for a start-up fund, premature and with little precedent in the market at this size. In the case instead Monetalis sees itself as an Asset Allocator, MakerDAO should receive significant more colour about what underlying investment managers Monetalis intends to engage, their track record, and what is the underlying strategy, before approval Monetalis\u2019 team is a new team, with limited capacity and unproven track record - it would be advisable for the team to focus on the execution of one initiative and prove itself on one before trying to tackle (very) different things at the same time Monetalis\u2019 team is a small team, without evident specialised knowledge for both initiatives  It is my opinion that Monetalis\u2019 impact for the community would be higher and better fitting with its core skills with Clydesdale rather than Vault v2, but it is not for me to say. As a prospective control group within MakerDAO, however, I would suggest MKR token holders to think carefully whether to endorse Monetalis simultaneously on two very challenging, and very different, proposals.  On the Proposal\u2019s Intended Process I won\u2019t repeat @monkey.irish\u2019s words here too much, but I will reiterate that the ad hoc nature of this (and other) MIP is concerning on a process perspective for the protocol. Namely:  The current proposal does not have the required details on strategy and execution partners for the community to have a fully informed decision that leads to immediate implementation The intention not to follow the Collateral Onboarding Process, with the Domain Teams assessing all questions before onboarding, raises several additional risks that aren\u2019t necessary The ad hoc prioritisation demanded by the current MIP takes away from the Domain Teams one of their current abilities, which is to prioritise all existing proposals based on their knowledge and the mandate they have been empowered with by the community, and without sufficient a priori information; this has the risk of reducing over the medium term the ability of the protocol to evolve in the interest of the \u201cfirst come first served\u201d MIP proponent, and in addition to push every counterparty to unilaterally define the criticality of their MIP disregarding the collateral onboarding process and the structured approach that the Domain Teams are maintaining and evolving  For this reason, I feel deeply uncomfortable to endorse a MIP that intends to bypass any structured process in favour of an ad hoc one. We understand that the current MIP process is imperfect, but I would advise Monetalis to converge back towards the standard MIP process and help simultaneously the Domain Teams to improve this process for the future. Ad hoc solutions might seem efficient in the short term, but their cost in the medium one cannot be underestimated. Regards, Luca ",

Please stand up    Unfortunately there is no such single person, nor is there any Maker timeline (much less RWF agreed timeline) that prioritizes \u2018must have a RWF bond player approved or even approve-able by governance in Q2 2022\u2019.     SebVentures:  Happy to hear more of @Recognized-Delegates here. It\u2019s a RFC period on an important matter, but those that are steering the protocol are quite silent in this very important debate (or lack of thereof).   From what I am seeing Huntington is more likely to be able to hurdle RWF, legal, and Oversight than Monetalis. It has also been made clear what likely reactions would be of RWF, legal and Oversight CUs should governance pass this proposal.  Given that this particular proposal bypasses a number of CU checks and prioritizes Monetalis specifically I don\u2019t believe it will or can get any significant support. The issues around Monetalis have repeatedly been made clear by RWF:  No prior track record as a company.  Monetalis just doesn\u2019t have any track record as a company in the space as an operating unit. Equity financing is not well laid out which may lead to lack of focus if they need to raise funding. There are potential investor conflicts of interest (not a deal killer, but not a deal helper). In the specific case of bonds (if I remember correctly), no specialized expertise in bond portfolio management.  The rest about equity buffers, etc are more applicable to other types of RWA that Monetalis was proposing in their other application. ",

Interacting with Maker Governance  Monetalis\u2019 Exchange with Governance  MIP6  Speedy-boarding attempt (arguably, not theirs) War Bonds for Ukraine MIP65 MIP68   On-chain Equivalent? A Team launches a coin. They propose it through a MIP6. @Risk-Core-Unit / @Protocol-Engineering / @Oracles-Core-Unit tell the community that we should focus on other deals. A Team then proposes a standalone MIP to get onboarded (?). Passing this MIP is telling the aforementioned teams .  On the Importance of Frameworks  Is MIP6 not enough? We have frameworks for a reason. If MIP6 is not sufficient, we should fix it. (Probably @collateral-core-unit has a thousand ideas for this).  The need for prioritization We also need to be clear on how to prioritize (and how to communicate it with our partners and communities). Maker should onboard collateral types based on a lot of different factors, but hopefully, the amount of MIPs/forum posts written by the team is not a decisive factor.  Where\u2019s the referee? Some people have approached me saying that @GovAlpha-Core-Unit should shield governance from this type of proposal. I think that refereeing is quite hard, and we don\u2019t want to \u201ccensor\u201d good projects or ideas.  This MIP in Particular The two points below are quite important to me. The @MIP-Editors might disagree, but I\u2019m having a hard time understanding what governance is voting on exactly. We will have some interesting discussions regarding the implementation of this MIP as is.  The Trojan Horse Attribute A proposal with prioritization within? That\u2019s quite the novelty. Ideally, we would vote on proposals and priorities separately.  Self-contained MIP? This MIP does not contain enough information to be self-contained.  Unhappy Path What happens if any of the Maker checks fail?  Conclusion Even if (big if) this was the best collateral type in the world, the precedent for this MIP passing would be quite bad, from a governance perspective. ",

                    "content": "IMO it is extremely important context to add that the only example of a proper RWA deal that has EVER been done in Maker was by 6s Capital, following a process similar to this with MIP21 and MIP13c3-SP4. We are talking about using the Maker Improvement Proposal process here. It\u2019s the undisputed fundamental process of Maker Governance. I don\u2019t think it is reasonable to characterise it as \u201cad hoc\u201d, or dismiss it based on appeal to bureaucracy, when it clearly follows the only example that exists in the category of what it\u2019s trying to do, using the one fundamental, rock solid process that we have available.  My main concern against backing this proposal goes to preserving Core Unit autonomy. This proposal makes very specific instructions on how to proceed in the event of a positive vote, with limited possibility of Core Units influence or discretion. While I do see the wish for an expedited process it does set a precedent for future on-boarding applications.  This proposal does give Core Units full autonomy, they have the complete unilateral ability to accept or reject the proposal based on whether it fulfils the very straight forward requirements that spelled out, that provide full protections for MKR holders interests. This is very clearly spelled out in the components of the MIP. Btw, there are multiple other major RWA deals considering using this approach to attempt an onboarding. Why? Because there currently exists no process that can be trusted to actually work or provide any kind of certainty around timeframe, which makes it unfeasible. We cannot expect businesses to work with us based on some inner passion or charity that makes them keep getting up again no matter how many bureaucratic curveballs they get. We are no longer some hobby project, we are the scale of billions and that requires working with real businesses that need to be able to reasonably estimate that they will get a positive expected value out of the time, energy and costs of trying to interact with Maker. Btw I realize now that I removed the earlier post where i originally put this disclaimer: it\u2019s important to note that I am an investor in Monetalis and have a financial interest in this proposal passing(not that it bears any weight against my MKR holdings). At the same time, I never vote on proposals and never influence the votes of delegates (in terms of reallocating votes based on specific voting behaviour). However, the other projects I am supporting with getting their deals onboarded using the MIP process are being done purely in my interest as an MKR holder that wants to see something finally getting done.

That being said, I object strongly to the language in this MIP. This paragraph in particular:  To ensure the onboarding occurs as fast as is reasonable, and isn\u2019t unnecessarily delayed, no other collateral onboardings with debt-ceiling below DAI 100M can occur, unless those collateral onboardings also have been directly and specifically authorised through a self-contained, stand-alone, numbered MIP similar to this.  If passed, this would effectively block D3Ms, multi-chain liquidity strategies, MCD deployments on other chains, wormhole, etc. All of which are being worked on largely in parallel. I can appreciate some things can appear to be moving slowly from the outside, but from what I\u2019ve seen the teams are moving as fast as possible on multiple fronts. I\u2019ve seen the DAO grow and professionalize over the past year, and I believe we are starting to hit our stride. Cross team communication and transparency have sometimes been lacking (growing pains of a flat structure), but we are identifying and correcting the problems. Even just reading this discussion I can see that the process for getting something onboarded is not clear. CUs are working to fix this. As a mandated actor, I can say that from my experience we are actively working to grow the yield-bearing DAI supply as fast as possible. From what I can see nobody is stone-walling, everyone is acting in good faith and we are largely aligned on the same goals. This is human nature sometimes when you don\u2019t have full view into the decision making process to assume bad faith. We must resist this impulse as much as possible especially during this rapid growth phase. The Core Units were elected to do a job, and if you don\u2019t trust our judgement you should vote us out. Forcing through a MIP from an outside party which ties our hands on using best judgement is a huge mistake, and I would like to see a MIP soon that prevents this sort of forced language as it will likely be abused in the future.

But on the other hand, when new features are introduced to the protocol, that is typically done through a full MIP that clearly specifies the upgrade and expansion of the protocol. As long as that precedent continues to be followed then all it would require to overcome this issue is that the feature upgrade MIP specifies that it has a collateral onboarding component to it (if creating a vault type is necessary for launching the feature). This would clearly make a it qualify as a collateral onboarding that has \u201cbeen directly and specifically authorised through a self-contained, stand-alone, numbered MIP\u201d and become able to circumvent the block on sub-100M collateral onboardings. Some early significant examples of \u201cfeature upgrade MIPs\u201d: MIP25: Flash Mint Module MIP27: Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module MIP29: Peg Stability Module MIP30: Farmable cUSDC Adapter (CropJoin) IMO the precedent set by these feature MIPs is very beneficial to the protocol since it helps make it very clear when the scope and complexity of the protocol is expanded, so I wouldn\u2019t think it is a problem that collateral onboarding of large and significant collateral types makes it harder to break with this precedent. It\u2019s important to point out that arguably at least the Protocol Engineering Core Units do have a specific authorization to technically make upgrades or changes to the protocol based on language in MIP41c2: Facilitator Governance Powers  Facilitators have the power to propose weekly Executive Votes (defined in MIP16) related to their Core Units.  However, in practice even after receiving this power in MIP41 the precedent of using the full MIP process for large scale protocol upgrades has still been followed, with examples such as: MIP45: Liquidations 2.0 - Liquidation System Redesign MIP50: Direct Deposit Module MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals IMO the same general logic goes for e.g. the SocGen onboarding as Nadia points out - it\u2019s a new and ambitious type of collateral onboarding, and such onboardings have a similar existing precedent of making sure that such expansions of the collateral type implementations are approved through the full MIP process. some examples of \u201cnew type of collateral onboarding\u201d MIPs, such as MIP21: Real World Assets - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender MIP22: Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module The PSM and D3M MIPs from above are some other examples One thing I just want to make sure is also clear is that the prioritization blocks that have been posted so far are limited to blocking collateral onboarding of a scale of less than 100 million. This means Core Units would still be able to freely use their Facilitator governance privilege to do large scale collateral onboardings of more than 100 million, which means there\u2019s no possibility that large and significant deals, that can be done faster than the MIPs process would allow, would be deprioritized because of an existing self-contained collateral onboarding MIP. I think if there are still issues beyond this, then it would be important to address them as much as possible in current MIPs in RFC, or any future MIPs that want to use a prioritization enforcement component. As for MIP65, it\u2019s already in formal submission so Allan wouldn\u2019t be able to make changes to it at this stage. But Allan already pledged to use the unilateral withdrawal mechanism if any sort of delay occurs, so it should be expected that if this MIP goes through it will no matter what result in a very swift removal of the non-MIP small collateral onboarding block. And overall we are talking about a single proposal to finally, finally, finally get something done by removing and activating 500 million of the 6 billion USDC we have sitting around following best practice that we know is safe from a legal, risk and liquidity perspective and in a manner that is fully guided and verified by the relevant mandated actors including Christian from RWF and the Strategic Finance Core Unit. Even if bureaucratically it isn\u2019t absolutely perfect I just don\u2019t see why that matters when it gets something so worthwhile done. The perfect bureaucracy can come later, but it isn\u2019t here yet, and until it\u2019s here it just makes no sense to delay or shut down progress. ",

This would restart the onboarding process and the mandatory waiting periods. From my uninformed and outside perspective, this all just sounds like a power struggle.  Monetalis wants some certainty that this onboarding will be taken seriously and worked on and core units don\u2019t want to be forced into prioritizing this through the proposal (even if it is a priority).  You could say there\u2019s a little bit of trust lacking on both sides. The answer is probably no but is there any way for a third option to make amendments without restarting the waiting periods?  Informally agree to prioritize this MIP but allow for work to continue where it needs to continue.  Agree to a reasonable time frame for assessments and polls.  Agree that this MIP is not precedent setting since changes to the process are being made anyway.  Hopefully, future proposals won\u2019t feel the need to put this clause in because the priority process is clarified and improved. Anyway, I agree that delegates should just speak up on their stance so we don\u2019t waste time.  If it\u2019s a big enough priority, I think it\u2019s okay to vote just approve it and caveat your vote with your disagreement to the clause in question.  Rejecting it over something like this sends a message too.  Maybe that\u2019s the message you want.  Delays to obviously beneficial proposals and ideas are easier to stomach for those who are still getting paid but it\u2019s definitely frustrating for the average mkr holder. ",

                    "content": "Hello from GovAlpha  We wanted to first confirm that this MIP is valid for submission and will be proceeding to a Ratification Poll on Monday. Additionally, we felt it would be good to highlight what this proposal asks of specific Core Units, as well as explain how we would be mandated to respond if this MIP passed. This will hopefully clear up any lingering confusion for Core Units and others observing this thread. Finally, just to clairify we will not be allowing changes to this MIP after the frozen period. If @Allan_Pedersen wishes to withdraw the formal submission to make changes before the May cycle that is alright, but in order for it to be considered on Monday, it must do so in its current form (like all other MIPs entering the April cycle). The following instructions and mandates would result if this proposal passes:  Core Unit Instructions @Real-World-Finance, @luca_pro (LOVE incubation), and @christiancdpetersen (LTS incubation) are instructed to \u201cprovide a Verification of the legal and governance structure appropriateness for holding a large amount of low risk real world asset collateral for Maker\u201d via a forum post. @strat-fin-core-unit are instructed to \u201cprovide a Verification of the Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction ensuring that only execution of bond strategies appropriate to use as large scale liquid RWA collateral can be acquired with assets provided to the legal structure by Maker\u201d via a forum post. @collateral-core-unit (with the support of @Protocol-Engineering (and other relevant supporting CUs) are instructed to \u201cdeploy smart contracts that hard code the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure specified in MIP65c2, and follow the MIP21 framework.\u201d Note that:     Allan_Pedersen:  These smart contracts must only allow for the generation of Dai through a vault that is sent to the ETH address of the legal structure as its ultimate destination, and it must not be technically possible to send the Dai elsewhere, in accordance with MIP21. There must also not be any additional technical features or complexity that goes beyond the minimum necessary smart contracts and dummy constructs to enable the generation of Dai and its transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure. The ability to initiate the generation of Dai from the vault and trigger their transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure is given to an Ethereum address controlled by Monetalis. This address must have no ability to access the funds    GovAlpha Resulting Mandates The most relevant passage here is:     Allan_Pedersen:  To ensure the onboarding occurs as fast as is reasonable, and isn\u2019t unnecessarily delayed, no other collateral onboardings with debt-ceiling below DAI 100M can occur, unless those collateral onboardings also have been directly and specifically authorised through a self-contained, stand-alone, numbered MIP similar to this.   We find this wording to be unambiguous, it clearly instructs GovAlpha not to put any new collateral onboarding through an executive vote unless:  The initial Debt Ceiling is at or above 100 million DAI OR The collateral onboarding in question is the result of a stand-alone MIP.  This would exclude MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Applications. It would also exclude D3M implementations that are not approved through their own MIP process (meaning that MIP50: DAI Direct Deposit Module does not pave the way for other specific D3M integrations). Additionally, while the Wormhole implementation would not be excluded (it is a bridge for DAI, and doesn\u2019t seem to match the intent of this MIP), any new collaterals occuring on L2s would be subject to the restrictions of the MIP.  Potential Governance Complications As we have already seen other proposals utilize the same prioritization language, there can be a rather obvious conflict if a future proposal(s) seek to exclude/gain priority over this one before it can be implemented. In this event, governance would essentially be locked until an amendment, un-blocking\" signal, or some other superseding governance imperatives were passed by MKR holders. There may also be some debate on what counts as collateral onboarding as defined by this MIP. While items like D3M have caused some confusion in the onboarding process (they are both implementing a collateral and a new technical integration with another service or platform), it should generally be understood that if this MIP passes Governance should not be able to vote on new credit facilities unless the above exceptions are present.  Questions and Comments GovAlpha has had a busy couple of weeks responding to inquiries about the language in this MIP and found making a public post such as this one would be the best course of action. As always, follow-up here is encouraged and we will continue our best efforts to respond to inquiries about the governance nature of new proposals. Edit: some of the @Recognized-Delegates have been asking about this as well, thanks to Pablo for suggesting to add the tag ",

Such a strategy may include a diversification mix of maturities, borrower types, geography, theme focus and investment ratings. We are pursuing further evidence of this strategy\u2019s appropriateness. Just for illustration of a Barbell strategy see this picture:   With how new this whole thing is i would suggest not being overly worried with high returns at this stage. I think the priority here should be getting all of the legal hurdles out of the way and start to prove that this trust you are creating can ACTUALLY BE TRUSTED. That being the case I would suggest sticking to the lowest risk option for now, and not be overly concerned with sharpe ratios or even total returns. You guys can optimize returns later if you pull this off without losing people billions. ",

At first I was pretty shocked by the united front from the core units in this thread, but after taking a step back I\u2019ve been able to look at the situation with fresh eyes. In light of the strong reaction I can understand how this was perceived badly, and because of the lack of warning and the approach of applying all the critical details as an edit in at the last second I understand why that triggered the emotional and personal reactions we\u2019ve seen. I can understand that it felt kind of like an attack, and as a result there\u2019s an instinctual response of lashing back, especially when its coming from allan but with me clearly lurking on the sidelines. In hindsight I should have spent a lot more time talking to people behind the scenes, trying to prepare people for this and ensure it didnt result in this kind of negative first impression. But hope you can trust me that I simply approached this from a DAO, decentralization and game theoretic perspective, and simply misjudged to what degree we are starting to mature past the stage where behind the scenes conversations are important before engaging publicly on something new and ambitious. It\u2019s not about trust in any individual, it was simply a question of providing Allan and others the best advice on how to make sure these large, potentially important and lucrative deals can most directly deal with the daunting task of attempting a collateral onboarding, knowing how many things have already gotten stuck over the years. I believe in this approach because it provides clarity, transparency and proves we can get things done. The prioritization enforcement means that for the first time ever, the DAO will be in a situation where it can make a decision with a very high level of clarity about the results. Without such a things will slow down significantly, not just on the core unit side but on both ends. It\u2019s like the prisoners dillema - if there\u2019s nothing pushing core units to prioritize this, as a result there would be a lot of hesitation on the monetalis side to take the risk on paying the necessary expenses to get it to a point where it can fully verified. This hesitation would in turn make core units further deprioritize it etc. Things would happen much slower, and maybe could completely stall if the right human interactions and relationships aren\u2019t in place to drive it and try to push it forward. On the other hand, with a clear prioritization that actually can be counted on, both sides can move in tandem, coordinate and get it done and dealt with and out the door, so Maker can get rid of USDC as quickly as possible, and the core units can move on to the next deal. I really hope that people can step back from this and take a look at this proposal objectively and see it for what it is - a vote that will allow us to decisively onboard 500 million of no-brainer collateral and finally put a dent in the USDC. IMO if you read the language carefully there should be no question about the due diligence embedded in this proposal. This proposal provides much stronger and better due diligence compared to the standard MIP6 process, which calls for a (paraphrased) \u201crisk assessment, oracle assessment, and smart contracts assessment\u201d which are not really that relevant for an RWA onboarding. Meanwhile this proposal explicitly embeds an assessment of the legal structure, and unambiguously requires a full verification, that the protections that are clearly spelled out in the MIP, are in place in the actual de facto implemented legal structure. Without such a verification no there\u2019s no possibility of a debt ceiling being implemented.  Legal structure and governance appropriateness Verification The Real World Finance Facilitator and the \u201cin SES incubation\u201d Facilitator of Legal and Transactions Services must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the legal and governance structure appropriateness for holding a large amount of low risk real world asset collateral for Maker.  And it provides a liquidity assessment with similar levels of protections. The de facto implemented legal mechanism that regulates what assets the trust can purchase needs to be assessed and verified to be appropriate from a liquidity perspective for use as large scale liquid Maker collateral, by the Strategic Finance Core Unit who have Asset-Liability Management as one of their responsibilites.  Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction Verification The Strategic Finance Facilitator must, also through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction ensuring that only execution of bond strategies appropriate to use as large scale liquid RWA collateral can be acquired with assets provided to the legal structure by Maker.  And again, the Core Units have FULL AUTONOMY to make these assessments and use their professional expertise and judgement to decide whether the collateral onboarding fulfills the strict conditions mentioned above, and as a result should go through or not. Even if this MIP is voted through, they have full autonomy to block it.  these Verifications are, of course, voluntary in nature. Should one such Verification not be forthcoming, for whatever reason, this MIP will not move forward in the collateral onboarding process to eventually fulfil the conditions of MIP65c4 (executive vote and block removal) and the Maker Community can use MIP65c5 (cancellation procedure) to remove the onboarding block, or Monetalis can use MIP65c6 to unilaterally withdraw the Collateral Onboarding and remove the non-MIP Collateral Onboarding block.  Finally there\u2019s the unilateral withdrawal which ensures that in practice, if any kind of issue should arise then the collateral onboarding will immediately be withdrawn and the prioritization enforcement block will be removed instantaneously.  MIP65c6: Unilateral Instant Collateral Onboarding withdrawal   After this MIP has been approved, Monetalis can at any time through a public forum post, unilaterally withdraw the Collateral Onboarding application. This nullifies all aspects of MIP65c1, MIP65c2, MIP65c3 and MIP65c4, and instantly removes the Collateral Onboarding block specified MIP65c1, and formally removes MIP65 from the Collateral Onboarding process.   This option allows the proposer to prevent their reputation from being damaged by forcing the community to spend time and energy on performing a MIP65c5 cancellation procedure, if some unforeseen issue should arise after the approval of the MIP.  and Allan\u2019s quote from later in the post:  I am entirely committed to using the unilateral withdrawal mechanism in this MIP, in the unlikely and unexpected event that something slows down the verification and onboarding process. If we cannot get the promised pace into this onboarding, I will withdraw it immediately.  The game theory of why this is guaranteed to happen since allan will need to do it to protect his reputation should be quite clear.  In either case the language sets a terrible precedent.  IMO this really depends on the context of this united front of pushback from the core units, and the answer to this following question: Assuming that MIP65 is approved end of April and fully executed over the course of May, what exactly are the collateral onboarding(s) that are  less than 100 million debt ceiling guaranteed to get fully finalized and executed in May provide superior value to the community compared to this deal  (a side question is also why didn\u2019t we know about such a rock solid plan and timeline already and why wasnt that the main argument from the start) Now, if such a situation exists, where there is a clearly superior choice being prepared by the Core Units to be executed through Facilitator Governance Privilige powers that would be blocked through this MIPs prioritization enforcement, then you are absolutely right. This MIP would set a terrible precedent by having MKR voters micromanage the core units and force them away from working on a superior deal, towards working on a worse deal. I completely agree that the information about the conflicting, superior deal should be clearly presented, and then this MIP should be voted down in such a situation if it is really clear and unambiguous. I\u2019m sure Allan, as a maker stakeholder would also agree with this. If the process is clearly reliable and merit based, everyone wins. But on the other hand if no such situation exists, think about the precedent if this deal is voted down after being on the receiving end of such a united front by the core units. Basically we would be voting no on a deal that everyone agrees provides benefit to MKR holders, entirely on the basis on a dispute of technicalities and process that could just as easily be sorted out later, after we have gotten the things done that are ready to be done now. I can see how some people could describe it as looking like a power struggle and IMO that\u2019s not a good look and just overall a setback to maker governance IMO. I could be wrong, but I assuming we can all agree that it\u2019s a no brainer compared to just holding USDC - legal structure designed and verified by christian, bond strategy designed and verified by strategic finance and the overall effect being making some decent income and letting us finally prove we have the means to get rid of large amounts of USDC. The only thing I could see be a question of value in the long run would be the monetalis fee, but that could only be expected to go down through competitive pressure and having more arrangers wiling to hold bonds, which will only happen in the first place if the community shows that its possible to onboard as such using a reasonable process that provides some kind of certainty and clarity.

I\u2019ll elaborate on why I think this differs from previous MIPs in a very consequential way. Up until this MIP, it has been standard for MIPs to provide governance-level guidance to the relevant domain experts, but they have never forced our hand into taking a particular course of action. This changes that, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good business decision.     rune:  It\u2019s not about trust in any individual, it was simply a question of providing Allan and others the best advice on how to make sure these large, potentially important and lucrative deals can most directly deal with the daunting task of attempting a collateral onboarding, knowing how many things have already gotten stuck over the years. I believe in this approach because it provides clarity, transparency and proves we can get things done. The prioritization enforcement means that for the first time ever, the DAO will be in a situation where it can make a decision with a very high level of clarity about the results.       rune:  On the other hand, with a clear prioritization that actually can be counted on, both sides can move in tandem, coordinate and get it done and dealt with and out the door, so Maker can get rid of USDC as quickly as possible, and the core units can move on to the next deal.   Agree with the assessment that we need to be able to provide stronger guarantees to counter-parties. We have been dealing with this issue as Core Units for a number of months now. Negotiations are fundamentally better handled in private, so how to walk that line between getting a good deal, being transparent and having the authority to approve something has been an ongoing challenge. I think the way to do this is to give more autonomy from governance to have relevant domain experts making executive decisions rather than having governance be the guarantees mechanism. Core Units can always be booted out if they are underperforming, and this plays into your Supporting Core Units plan to audit and make sure things are running smoothly.     rune:  I really hope that people can step back from this and take a look at this proposal objectively and see it for what it is - a vote that will allow us to decisively onboard 500 million of no-brainer collateral and finally put a dent in the USDC.   I will hold my judgement until the relevant domain experts weigh in. There has been no due diligence, so I do not consider this a no-brainer.     rune:  IMO if you read the language carefully there should be no question about the due diligence embedded in this proposal.   Glad to hear and your explanation on it being the guarantees of the deal makes sense to me now, but as I said I do not believe this is the role of governance to make these guarantees. It should be the domain experts as elected by governance vote.     rune:  Assuming that MIP65 is approved end of April and fully executed over the course of May       rune:  guaranteed to get fully finalized and executed in May   I think this is maybe an assumption where you are losing people. SocGen has taken 8 months or so to work out a deal, and they are a large, reputable institution. Admittedly I know very little about Monetalis, but from the outside they appear like a startup with a couple of employees and a completely unknown reputation. Executing a loan this size should not be expected to sail through due diligence in a month. My personal preference while in this legal grey area is to prefer borrowers who are highly reputable in lieu of legal enforcement, but if RWF signs off after proper DD and outlining the risks then I am okay with this.     rune:  Basically we would be voting no on a deal that everyone agrees provides benefit to MKR holders   I do not agree to this. I want to see proper DD first, and then I will decide. So should every MKR holder. So in summary, I am okay with proceeding on the path of evaluating this as a possible loan, but the language that forcibly ties the hands of CUs needs to be removed and this should be re-submitted. We have many more well-known entities / protocols coming down the pike. Growth is about to release their proposal for the System Surplus DAI cap raise and PE has been working full force on getting D3Ms up for Compound, Maple and Rari Fuse pools along with finally launching MCD on other chains in Q2. We are not in a rush. We still have a large first-mover advantage and we are accelerating the growth process with a cap raise. Let\u2019s stay the course because it\u2019s working imo. ",

                    "content": "Thx for the response. Let me just reiterate, this proposal doesn\u2019t override the need for an assessment, and additionally requires a clear unambiguous verification of the legal guarantees that this MIP spell out, that cover all bases Maker could want. This verification must be done by Christian under the umbrella of RWF, indirectly the elected domain expert on legal matters. And keep in mind he will have full autonomy to provide the verification. It only goes through if Christian is satisfied with the structure. The game theory then dictates that Allan has to let Christian fully design the structure exactly the way he wants it, or there\u2019s no guarantee to Allan the verification will be possible. Similarly for the question of the liquidity and return profile of the rated, public bonds. The final, legally implemented setup must be verified by the Strategic Finance team to \u201censure only execution of bond strategies appropriate to use as large scale liquid RWA collateral can be acquired with assets provided to the legal structure by Maker.\u201d Again, Strategic Finance has full autonomy to decide whether to provide this verification, which means that game theoretically allan has no choice but to let them fully design the restriction in exactly the way they want.  I think this is maybe an assumption where you are losing people. SocGen has taken 8 months or so to work out a deal, and they are a large, reputable institution.  I understand why it seems fitting to make this comparison, but I think it\u2019s completely wrong, and comparing monetalis to socgen actually helps explain why this and other deals using similar methods it can be done so fast. SocGen is a deal for actual on-chain bonds, unlike anything Maker has done before and containing all sorts of novel legal and technical challenges. This MIP65 deal is a maximally simple structure based on the basic proven model of the 6s vault, meaning all the questions of creation, liquidations, emergency shutdown, winddown etc are all known and proven in the wild. The structure fundamentally is based on the idea that the blockchain component is as minimal as possible, basically just getting dai into some offshore entity that then injects it to the trust through a broker. Everything on the other side is just a normal cookie cutter financial transaction, nothing novel. We have known have to do this in the community for 9 months at least, we have just not had the process and ecosystem to actually use this knowledge for anything large scale constructive yet. But at this point there is basically nothing we know better in this community than how to do the classic, standard trust structure. And Monetalis has already been engaging with allan for a very long time at this point, it\u2019s basically not possible to get any more prepared for a swift onboarding. And it really should be obvious that a large bank is always gonna do a defi transaction 100 times slower than a startup with experienced financial professionals, even if the bank wasn\u2019t trying to do something complicated. Finally since this is for public bonds, the size of the deal does not impact the timeline. A complex bond strategy could make it take longer, but then Strategic Finance could just elect to pick only short term treasury bonds and have that be the extent of the due diligence. Allan has estimated to me that it would be unlikely to take more than a month, and could probably take less. IMO there is no reason to do a hard commitment to some exact timeline since you can never know the exact last minute hurdles. The important thing is that if it starts to drag out and block other things that are more important than getting a 500 million deal closed (dont forget, this would only be applicable to sub 100M DC), then Allan will have to protect his reputation and the onboarding will be withdrawn. I think the D3Ms are an important thing to consider, and my reaction for a best path forward is that we should request a carve out of specific exemptions to those that right now are transparently planned and being prepared in the other RWA MIPs that are in RFC and are doing prioritization. It\u2019s clear that they are important and can scale to levels equivalent to large RWA deals (at least compound), but shouldn\u2019t be hindered by having to do the full MIP process, and at the same have to begin their life with a very low debt ceiling to accumulate lindy effect. For this deal, we don\u2019t have any option due to the MIP process, but I think in all cases it\u2019s worth it to just make sure we can get the 500 million through. While I think it would have been even better to ensure D3Ms could go through despite this MIP, there wasn\u2019t clarity about these onboardings before the frozen period cutoff occured, I think it\u2019s clearly worth to just get the deal done and then just do the D3Ms as soon as the deal has gone through. We may lose out on a couple of days or weeks worth of lindy effect on the D3Ms, but we will get 500 million of USDC swiftly dealt with. ",

And as such, scale can only be achieved through operationalizing the process. When something doesn\u2019t work, we need to fix it. This is about a real problem that needs to be discussed and alignment created. I believe this is one of these situations where the community needs to provide input/feedback and help create the actual solution as this transcends any one core unit. I too want to act as a real business and that means we put the DAO first and do what is best for the protocol. Today, we have a business to run so let\u2019s go do that. It also requires us to examine the sources of information, the level of involvement, and the understanding economic incentives of all parties involved. I appreciate your disclosure as I think transparency is very important especially since you have been a strong advocate/supporter/advisor of this deal.     rune:  Because there currently exists no process that can be trusted to actually work or provide any kind of certainty around timeframe, which makes it unfeasible.

If the DAO wants something, let\u2019s be clear on what that is, draft our own verbiage, and vote on it. If we we are unable to do this for any reason, then this continued hijacking of the DAO will happen. I mean, I get it. If I was an investor in Monetalis, the OPM projects, or others that come the DAO\u2019s way, I would work around of the inefficiencies of the DAO. I find economic incentives to be a very powerful motivator and I am all for them\u2026as long as the DAO is creating the rules. The latest round of MIPs do not put the DAO in a position of authority and that is the heart of the matter for me. I want to be clear these are my personal opinions and you may or may not agree with them. From a CES CU perspective, we are committed to finding a solution that works, whatever that might look like, to scale the supply of Dai safely and securely and in the most cost effective manner possible.

But hope you can trust me that I simply approached this from a DAO, decentralization and game theoretic perspective, and simply misjudged to what degree we are starting to mature past the stage where behind the scenes conversations are important before engaging publicly on something new and ambitious.   No please, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the solution (talking behind the scenes), nor to present a proposal that, besides implementing a solution for managing the PSM exposures, wants to change the MIP processes by introducing a self-contained prioritization. It would have been important to have you and Allan in the governance call to discuss this, openly, with everyone, thinking together about how to improve the way CUs are prioritizing their workload. I think the negative first impression is because we didn\u2019t talk about it, and although the forum is a great offline comm tool, we need these online discussions. Although the dream is to have a DAO wholly autonomous without people making decisions, we are far away from that. Under that reality, it\u2019s necessary to talk to people and explain yourself, but not behind the scenes.     rune:  It\u2019s not about trust in any individual, it was simply a question of providing Allan and others the best advice on how to make sure these large, potentially important and lucrative deals can most directly deal with the daunting task of attempting a collateral onboarding, knowing how many things have already gotten stuck over the years.   Are you sure this is the way to solve future onboardings getting stuck? what if everyone decides their collateral is a priority and uses the same method, how do you prioritize 10\u202620\u202630 priority collaterals? I would like your advice on how core units and facilitators can improve the way we prioritize, and communicate what we are doing. I know that\u2019s part of your MetaDAOs plan, and maybe the solution is somewhere in there, but as we are seeing now, we need a short-term solution to accelerate our onboarding processes. Probably we shouldn\u2019t be discussing this in a collateral onboarding proposal, and I wish this post would be more about how to get rid of all of the usdc we have and how to help the DAO to achieve that and not about how to force a prioritization solution that wasn\u2019t discussed before.

I think part of it is just that it\u2019s not easy to know what\u2019s happening at any one time unless you\u2019re tuned into every single proposal and where they are in the process.  If everyone is clear on current schedule and priorities, then it\u2019s easier to understand where to place new work and how it might affect current work.  It also helps to understand what capacity the teams have for work at any one time.  Maybe you cap the amount of work at any one time so anything else that gets approved is pushed into the future.  But then again, sometimes things happen and current work does need to get pushed aside for the urgent or more worthy.  These are all decisions that can be made through governance but it would be better if everyone knew what was going on. Within this proposal, I know I was focused on the benefits this would provide.  But if it\u2019s brought up that we\u2019re working on the D3Ms and MCD on other chains, I can weigh the benefits of this proposal with that work (supposing I actually understand the benefits and the timelines of the other work). One thing that is attractive about this proposal as presented was that it seemed as if much of the work was already done and things are ready to go.  When considering priorities, shouldn\u2019t low hanging fruit be attractive?  One question I\u2019m wondering is how much work in terms of time this is for the core units.  I understand there\u2019s analysis that needs to be done.  How much work is there for the PE or other teams? I know I have a lot of questions.  I\u2019m sure the CUs understand the implications upon current tasks much better than I do and I\u2019ll likely never understand it as well.  But it would be nice if it was easier to understand what goes on behind the scenes in order to ascertain whether all this pushback is justified.  Again, please educate me if there is something I should read to understand better.  I\u2019ve already learned a lot about the COB process through this post. ",

I\u2019m more or less asking if there is a captain in this ship. More precisely (as there is no captain in a DAO), what is the culture on this ship? One big tokenholder is A16Z. Ben Horowitz wrote a very good book The Hard Thing About Hard Things.  An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project.   People always ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret to being a successful CEO?\u201d Sadly, there is no secret, but if there is one skill that stands out, it\u2019s the ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves. It\u2019s the moments where you feel most like hiding or dying that you can make the biggest difference as a CEO.  The book has at least two examples of achieving stuff under a tight deadline. So maybe my question to delegates is to know if they are ready to do the hard things to make my MKR bags valuable.  Let\u2019s get things done Without short-term bonds, we can\u2019t produce yield on our assets. No one cares about losing 1.5B from the 3pool because we weren\u2019t doing anything with those anyway (and we should feel shame for that). Every month this project is delayed, we are losing $1M+. Good thing that MKR holders have strategic patience as a quality. Without short-term bonds, no capital increase as you will do no RWA nor be confident to be able to invest at scale. Without short-term bonds, we can\u2019t raise the DSR and supercharge our DAI exposure. On the legal side, we have MIP58 - RWA Foundations as a guide. Clydesdale is exactly the same as any RWA will need (with the exception of SocGen which has no economic value in the medium term), yet simpler as there is not much to deal with. Monetalis will not have much power in it so no need to spread FUD about that. On the financials side, I stated from the start that my preference is to do simple safe stuff (very short t-bonds). Is it optimal and safer? No, as illustrated in towards taking asset risks. But let\u2019s get something done and we can improve it down the line. Community will have the opportunity to chose. We can all agree that this MIP suck. It should be obvious that I\u2019m not a big friend of @rune  and seeing him bullied is part fun but part sad. I mean the guy made this protocol that is paying all CUs, own more than half of the hat that protect the protocol and bootstrapped delegates. Moreover, this is one rare time when I agree with him. I see two ways to move forward:  1 - Dropping the MIP and be serious about the work As we all wants the thing to be done, we can act as entrepreneurs. CUs can commit to be serious about prioritization of this work, RWF commit 1M of their 2M contingency buffer to compensate Monetalis if someone on our side is unfaithfully blocking the project. I can commit to yell if someone is not serious about it. @Allan_Pedersen delay the MIP and we fix it for next month (but starting the work NOW) with insurance of the delegates that they will vote it. No games, no politics, just work.  2 - Be creative for the blocked MIPs We vote the MIP. It\u2019s still unclear what important stuff is blocked by the MIP, but PE facilitators can always use their power to pass an executive or an \u201canon\u201d is submitting the executive (it\u2019s permissionless). All we need is delegates to come up with something and willing to do the hard things. Get with @rune in a call and fix this thing. I\u2019m no entrepreneur but I\u2019m willing to do the hard things. Happy to hear better ideas. Let\u2019s get things done together without delay. PS: To finish with another quote of the book, let\u2019s not end up like that:  At a certain size, your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that you\u2019d be associated with that kind of incompetence. Seeing people fritter away money, waste each other\u2019s time, and do sloppy work can make you feel bad. If you are the CEO, it may well make you sick. And to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse, it\u2019s your fault.  ",

In broad strokes I think the fundamentals of this proposal is good. I also get the impression that this is not what is sparking the most debate. Like @SebVentures I believe this proposal can help fix some of the strategic issues that Maker is dealing with. I also think this can be a good opportunity for Monetalis to gain a strategic partner, a source of capital and to gain experience. The core issue seems to be preservation of Maker\u2019s processes pitted against the very understandable desire from Monetalis to have this proposal come to fruition in a timely manner, justifying the time and effort they have put into it. The proposal as it stands is hard to support because we have already seen how it has the potential to spark a prioritization war, necessitating every future MIP to contain some form of prioritization language which defeats the whole point of putting it in in the first place. Given the current situation I am willing to pledge to support MIP65 given that it is withdrawn in its current form and resubmitted for the next governance cycle with section MIP65c1 removed. If enough other delegates will follow this pledge it would give Monetalis a safety that it will get approved and worked on, it will also allow Core Units to start working prior to a formal approval.

What seems to be the consensus is that the idea of buying short term bonds with usdc is good and low risk if done correctly.  This then is an opportunity to figure out how it might work.  Even if you start small, you can figure out some questions as to how liquid it will be or if there are any unintended consequences or technical issues to  be solved.  Monetalis is obviously deeply involved and part of the equation but it\u2019s worth trying out because if it works out, it\u2019s hopefully a new source of low risk revenue which can then be optimized further. Not that you should try to time things but yields have spiked recently especially for the shorter duration bonds.  2 year bond rates are not that far off 30 year year rates and 5 year rates have inverted 30 year rates.  Maybe they go up even more but now seems like a great time to enter this market. ",

What I keep hearing as a delegate is: that existing already with DC pipeline is \u2018insufficient\u2019 in structure.   This means Centrifuge/NewSilver DC is stuck,  6s DC effectively stuck.  Monetalis unsuitable for many reasons.   I have asked repeatedly on structure of pipeline with RWF and have gotten varied and changing answers   This is difficult, and never been done, etc.etc.   RWF, legal, and Oversight have been very clear about how Monetalis does not fulfill certain requirements.  I listed a few of these in my post.   So from the RWF CU standpoint Monetalis as per MIP65 at least as I have had to interpret their tea-leaf posts on the subject is a no-go. Also it has been made clear, if governance approves this MIP, that the event would be significant, set a bad precedent and be destructive to MakerDAO generally.   The structure of this MIP - specifically in the language that prioritizes Monetalis, halting work on anything else under 100M, and putting anything else over 100M into some queue behind Monetalis to many is excessive and a MIP criterion that I will not be supportive of.   I as a delegate (and others I believe) have been very clear, give us ANY deal that passes muster with RWF, and the other CUs and within a reasonable DC range and we will happily approve it. I want to respectfully ask a basic question to you @Rune regarding the energy you are putting into lobbying and reasoning for passing of Monetalis, while leaving New SIlver/Centrifuge and 6s, SocGen, Huntingdon to quietly navigate. While I have made public issues I have had with RWF, most of what they are bringing to the table with respect to RWA reviews and criterion are \u2018reasonable\u2019 and appear for the most part to be \u2018fairly applied\u2019.    Governance and MKR holders can disagree by basically putting up for offboarding either individuals or the unit, make the case and get governance to back it.  But I think given you have personally recommended @williamr, and for all intensive purposes RWF has signaled that Maker can do better than Monetalis with respect to a 100M deal, I wonder what has happened that you feel governance is properly suited to take affirmative action here, when those who, with experience, and expertise are tasked with being the experts on this subject are to be ignored.? If you feel governance should bypass RWF on this for Monetalis, then why are we avoiding NewSilver/Centrifuge and 6s?   What is so much better about Monetalis than 6s, or Centrifuge, and by what basis would you encourage delegates and/or MKR holders to bypass the paid experts on this important subject for MakerDAO? When I come down here I honestly want to extend DC on all of our existing players because most of them are already here working with Maker and have been waiting, working patiently, at great expense I might add.   Do a 50M Centrifuge, 50M 6s, and 50M monetalis.   I mean if governance is being encouraged to bypass RWF and go \u2018balls to the walls\u2019 to break the RWA log jam why not distribute the risk before taking on another 50M elsewhere? Why must we go for 100M btw, why isn\u2019t 50M good enough, etc. I am going to be as bluntly honest here as possible.  Today in the G&R call I watched GovComms put together a kind of report on MakerDAO CU activities (thank you so much btw GovComm) why can\u2019t we get a similar report on RWA so everyone can know where we are at here.   I grow tired of this \u2018trying to be considerate\u2019 in obscuring real status of our RWA queues and to my mind is disingenuous towards our RWA applicants (that we will deal with them in a timely manner).   We have Pando thinking in MIP73 that 6s legal structure is good when we have RWF telling governance to DC 0 that.   The total mismatch in communication and expectations with respect to the most important collateral type RWA, with the greatest potential for growth is mind boggling. Everyone wants to see this move somehow and no-one can honestly figure out where we can move, how, with whom. I may be slow here, and admit I can be dense, but I for one as a delegate am looking for clarity in RWA/RWF like I got today with GovComms on projects.  Someone please help me out, or put me out of my misery.! ",

But I also understand your point that it doesn\u2019t seem right on paper. I personally don\u2019t care at all about private credit RWA. Private credit RWA is all about increasing our expenses, putting politics front and center of Maker and all that to get something subpart results at the end (if something at all, as currently we are nowhere). The only reason to do private credit RWA would be to bootstrap the on-chain infrastructure. But then you need to embrace entrepreneurship which is not the direction neither. Well, what I said 6 months ago. ",

I hope we can all lift the quality of our commentaries. @MakerMan I understand your frustration deeply. The RWF-001 led by @williamr hasn\u2019t communicated sufficiently with the community on what the CU has been working on and what is an expectation of pipeline. This is not acceptable and, although RWF-001 has dramatically improved communication over the last weeks, as prospective facilitator of LOVE I am expecting more steps in this direction. At the same time, I believe the community should understand that RWF v2 has been onboard for only a couple of months and a significant amount of energy has been absorbed by discussions about Monetalis in its various shapes, and about the frustration of the community about RWF work. Yet, we are also seeing high quality proposals coming through. HVB, Pando, the OPM-led proposals that have been recently submitted are all valid examples. Those counterparties have (with the exception of Pando I understand) all benefited from extensive conversations and brainstorming with RWF-001 in order to propose the quality of MIP we are seeing now. This is something we should endorse RWF for, and that should have been better communicated by the Facilitator. The team has prioritised conversations with those MIPs because of the perceived high quality, financial impact, and likelihood of success. Last but not least, we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of flagging flaws in existing structures, and protecting the sustainability of DAI when proposals are brought forward that might jeopardise currency sustainability with the very limited surplus buffer we have. Doing so doesn\u2019t attract any political capital, actually consumes it as we have seen, and requires professional and personal weight. I endorse RWF-001 for this as well. We are starting to see the fruit of the work we have all been doing already coming through. I personally hope that the team will be able to focus and work on the existing proposals more and a bit less on defending itself on why it hasn\u2019t delivered anything yet. With 80% of time dedicated to self defence, the initiative risks to be trapped into a recursive loop of generalise frustration. ",

I really think a simple solution is to keep an up to date roadmap with clear schedules and timelines.  People will be less impatient if they understand what\u2019s happening and when to expect it to happen. This proposal is still unique because the other ones you mention (HVB, Pando, and OPM) do not address treasury bonds which are a different asset class with a different risk profile.  In a way, you could see it as a different RWA category to be thought through.  Using terms from the ALM framework, treasury bonds present significantly lower asset risk, market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk when compared to other real world assets.  This should come at the cost of lower returns but when you compare them to the currently supported or proposed RWA collateral, the returns for short term bonds are very comparable.  This is why there is a little more passion on this post because the opportunity is clear.  To be fair, counterparty risk still exists and I think most of the pushback in this proposal focuses in on this point along with getting the process and prioritization right.  Because of counterparty risk, you can\u2019t just throw everything you want to invest into one proposal.  But I think the community does see the value in this idea and hopefully there will be more proposals similar to this in the future so the risks can be spread out to multiple counterparties. ",

The in principle caveat is most important. This ad hoc MIP has the ambition of being self-contained, meaning that it provides already all the required elements for MKR holders to take a decision. This is where I disagree. The current MIP covers only a high-level view of the strategy, albeit one we all agree on. However, to ensure that the strategy does indeed carry very little credit/ liquidity risk and has limited execution risk, much more colour needs to be done on what partners Monetalis intends to partner with (not having Monetalis any bond management experience) and what is the exact strategy. In a post above Allan already hints at actually running credit risk in the strategy (below).     Allan_Pedersen:   am curious about the proposal from the asset manager but I am also nervous. A treasury portfolio should not, in principle, carry significant credit risk and a cross-over proposal IG-HY to squeeze a few bps of yield I believe doesn\u2019t go in the direction of reserve diversification and yield improvement that an initial treasury portfolio should have.  Here our views on the risk absorption capacity of the balance sheet may divert, but, as above, this is not the time for personal opinions or speculation. It is time for establishing data and analysis on the subject such that the community can make an informed science and data-based decision.   The ultimate point is that, although we all agree this strategy to be of extreme importance and, when executed well, carrying far less risk than off-chain collateral onboarding, we believe that the discussions would still have to run a proper onboarding process to ensure all domani teams providing their opinion. Given the size of the ask it shouldn\u2019t be an issue to make sure things are properly done without the overhanging threat of blocking the whole system. I am happy to see that @Allan_Pedersen and the Monetalis team are acknowledging it as well.     Allan_Pedersen:  @GovAlpha : Please withdraw MIP65 from final submission/vote for this cycle and keep it in RFC. Thanks!   ",

In most cases at best you can create an expectation of offboarding facilitators if they fail to perform their duties, but this has to be triggered manually and would only rarely happen in response to a single specific task.

However\u2026 this is pretty much the first time ever this has been done and because there was not enough effort at explaining it beyond just putting it up, it ended up feeling like putting a gun on the table (even though it is completely within the rights of governance participants and MKR holders)     Nadia:  No please, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the solution (talking behind the scenes), nor to present a proposal that, besides implementing a solution for managing the PSM exposures, wants to change the MIP processes by introducing a self-contained prioritization   There almost certainly have already been behind the scenes conversations between core units and maybe even core units and delegates discussing and coordinating action on how to shut down this proposal.

Confidence in this target can be found by the fact that the worked on deal-flow is already of $200M (6S aiming for $100M after 12 months  for instance)    By the time the CU multisig changed officially late Jan 2022, the following was the result: less than 17M in vaults.

Plus, if you don\u2019t control borrower acquisition (i.e. sourcing) it\u2019s hard to control targets. All that being said, spare me the sermon next time.

I was just trying to make the point that in public everyone will clearly take a stand for transparency and discourage hidden decision making. But the (right now necessary) reality is that most critical decisions and discussions occur and are decided behind the scenes, with the public interactions usually being less important. That\u2019s fine, nothing would happen if that wasn\u2019t the case and radical transparency is not something that just develops by itself because it really has no precedent. The problem is when the situation of behind the scenes decisions is denied. The instinctual unwillingness to reveal hidden decision making mechanisms is what has the potential to create what\u2019s known as the tyranny of structurelessness if it is not addressed in time. I\u2019m working on addressing it myself, so I\u2019m not talking about this just to cry about the sky falling, really just wanted to point it out in action. It\u2019s common sense that plenty of direct and private interaction needs to happen all the time in a DAO for anything to get done. It should also be common sense that separation of powers, radical transparency and disclosures must be enforced in order for a DAO to remain a DAO over the long run, once our initial group of highly trustworthy founders start to be replaced by a future workforce that we cannot expect to trust to the same degree. The two things are compatible, but it has never been done before and is a major challenge. I hope to be able to help the community evolve to that point where we can make it. ",

I believe that Monetalis can be a great partner to help the DAO diversify its treasury book, in accordance with the guidelines indicated by Strategic Finance and supported by the community. I believe also that it will be crucial to assess the ultimate manager of Maker\u2019s assets. We have seen that Monetalis intends to partner with Baillie Gifford to do that, and I think BG is the type of institution that we should attract. As a reminder Monetalis IS NOT a bond trader, but an intermediary for Maker, therefore before approving or allocating significant amounts through the MIP65 proposal, we should underwrite BG itself and not Monetalis\u2019 capabilities only. I believe this won\u2019t be an issue, given BG\u2019s pedigree, but something that will have to be done in case the proposal gets approved. I am looking forward to support the team the best way I can in case this proposal gets approved. ",

The MIP65 was originally drafted with a scope in mind which is currently changing as per funding requests by other core units: CES and SF. With that in mind, it is only natural that the accountability for verifying performance of legal duties is also amended to reflect the changes in responsibility for undertaking the work. Or at a minimum supervising that the legal review is done in accordance with best practices. Given RWF is not engaging the legal contractor to perform the review on MIP65, it is natural it should not have the responsibility for supervising its proper execution. I am therefore requesting that governance aligns the accountability for verification of legal & governance structure with the responsibility of performance of the task of legal review. Therefore placing the accountability with the responsible core unit, whichever team contracts the legal services for this MIP. Thanks, William ",
