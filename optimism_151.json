I want to hear your opinion on project(s) using token allocated to their project to boost their delegate voting power. In GF Phase 0, top three project got 21M OP(9 + 9 + 3) token and if they choose to delegate those token to themselves, it will lead to centralization in DAO which will hurt us all and might cause bias in DAO which is even bigger problem. Maximum number of voting we have seen so far was in GF Phase 0 when we saw 20M votes.  image771\u00d7178 14.9 KB  Imagine 2 delegate holding voting power of 18M which can guide any voting decision in their direction. My opinion:-  They should use the token for distribution plan mentioned in their proposal. All delegate must follow the same process, create the profile and users would choose anyone they want. At least give them a chance ? I know it will be diluted slowly but it will take a year and I think, its enough amount of time to do the damage of early stage gov such as ours.  I am not against on person holding too much power, that\u2019s a different discussion, I am questioning the approach. Better or ideal approach would be distributing the token as they seems fit as per their proposal plan and once its diluted, users will get a chance to choose their delegate. At least give us, a retail user,  a chance. What is your view on this ? Why this thought and discussion? because of this uptick I saw on Dune.  image1850\u00d7677 61.9 KB  Now, from my last experience, this is not directly towards anyone and please avoid name calling.

In the worst case scenario, the project can simply lie and take tokens and \u2018maliciously\u2019 affect future decisions. As always, distribution is key (there is no a perfect way), but for example, delegates have been careful with proposals soliciting \u2018excessive\u2019 amounts during phase 1, encouraging projects to divide their goal into different proposals/stages (sometimes  semms like a sort of primitive KPI options) instead of a single-step-to-long-term proposal. And these cases can be interpreted in different ways, since this action (by example) wasn\u2019t in the Token Plan, and it would be good if the project clarified this recent action. If any project expresses its desire to participate in some way it should not be misunderstood, Optimism is a protocol of protocols, and therefore we expect the participation of protocol teams, companies, DAOs, protocol communities, independent communities, organizations and individuals. However, transparency in the use of OP tokens is a must. Vested mechanism as proposed by @Netrim is worth considering (although it is not a good fit for many initiatives), in fact other networks have applied these mechanisms before, I will review their results and come back here.

Firstly, we\u2019re heavily invested in the future of OP given we are not deploying multi-chain and have gone all in on OP. With this we\u2019d like to see OP tokens utilised to grow the entire chain and ecosystem. We see the success of Perp tied to the success of OP. We\u2019d like to be able to maintain our voice going forward, especially given that over time this voice will decrease as we distribute tokens for the growth of OP. Given that other projects from Phase 1 will soon receive their tokens this is going to happen across the board. I\u2019m of the opinion that giving protocols who are OP native a voice is actually a good thing. Restricting these tokens and their usage creates a two fold problem:  Monitoring and enforcement is extremely hard and it\u2019s extremely easy for bad actors to bypass this You\u2019re creating a second class of tokens and effectively signalling that OP projects should not participate in governance  If it\u2019s a major concern we are happy to abstain from future votes until Phase 1 distributions to projects are completed.

With this we\u2019d like to see OP tokens utilised to grow the entire chain and ecosystem.  Believe me you when I say this, I am not involved with OP and any project on OP what so ever and still investing my time and energy here, you know why,its because I want to see the success of OP too, so we are on the same page here.  We\u2019d like to be able to maintain our voice going forward  Sure, I want that too but I am questioning your approach. You are a delegate like me and others here so you must follow the same approach, users will decide where they want to put their faith, if they choose you I am fine with that but at least give them a chance. You got those token not because you were able to create the traction for your project alone,is it ? All those TVL and addresses belongs to small users like me and not giving us a fair chance to raise our voice is wrong. I have just 140K votes assigned to me, do I have a place to raise my voice with that, Yes. Word you are looking for is \u201cdominance\u201d, you want to maintain your dominance in DAO gov and you choose the different approach, short one and wrong one.  Monitoring and enforcement is extremely hard and it\u2019s extremely easy for bad actors to bypass this  Yes, this might happen but if you dilute the token first as per your proposal plan, there are chance that we will hear more than 1 person voice. Other users might delegate to themselves or they will choose someone else. I would like to see more participation and more decentralized voting power, top 1% dominating the DAO will lead us to three steps back, decision will be biased and it will lead to lack of motivation and confidence in DAO gov.  You\u2019re creating a second class of tokens and effectively signalling that OP projects should not participate in governance  I never said that and that is/will never be my motivation, you are a delegate which means you have a voice in the DAO, I know for fact that other OP protects are also part of Delegates and on top of that, anyone can create a profile and advertise to get the voting power. Why should we give your special route ? That is my concern.  If it\u2019s a major concern we are happy to abstain from future votes until Phase 1 distributions to projects are completed.  I guess, my main concern is not clear yet, I am fine if you hold 20M or even 100M voting power, once that happen I will look for another DAO to waste my time and energy. Concern is your approach, dilute the token first as per your distributions plan and let user decide where they want to put their faith or buy the token from open market. That is my concern, abstaining will not fix this. ",

The most it can do is restrict further grants to these organizations, and frankly it should begin to budget the diffusion of voting rights to grantees into its decision-making. As an aside\u2013it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; member protocols are legitimate stakeholders! Though concentration in general can naturally be problematic for its own reasons, and of course that\u2019s why we have a bicameral governance structure in the first place, to mitigate many of these concerns. Let\u2019s say that Perp said, you know what, a governance token is just that \u2013 it is our right to exercise our governance power, and it was our presumption that we get it (not a lie if you take the right as given; i.e., it was not a thing you felt you had to disclose). They get 9mm votes in a governance structure where the average passing proposal gets 15-20mm yes votes. What do you do now? Do you fork Optimism? Blacklist the wallet? Print more tokens? Who do you deal them to? If you do any of these things, I now know that my governance token isn\u2019t quite that, that there are conditions. And that has long-lasting effects. ",

                    "content": "After reading the entire thread on this topic, I will try to answer some questions and points of view: 1- First of all I clarify that I am not a delegate, nor a member of the Optimism Foundation. I am an active member of this government and of the DefiLatam and OptimismESP community (no - official). 2- As any member of this government as a participant in it, I give my personal opinion on the proposals of PHASE 0,1 \u2026 Any other member may agree or disagree with my opinions, which does not mean that mine are law. Any member can give his opinion. 3- The proposals receive the feedback from the delegates and the government members. So anyone can defend any particular point, the final decision is always taken in Snapshot. Having clarified these points, I will go to what we are discussing: 1- In the case we have been discussing, to my understanding it is simple, the protocol receives 9M OP voted by this government with the promise it made during its postulation, says one thing (proposal) and does another. I think at this point almost all of us agree that it is not ethically correct. This particular case may lead to all winning proposals doing the same thing with OP tokens, this ends up hurting governance and the ecosystem. This may even incite protocols to make of the tokens whatever they want and not respect their original plan published in this governance. 2- Can protocols include in their proposals to allocate a % of the OP tokens received to governance? Yes they can and surely more protocols will do so. Now, from my point of view it is not correct because if they want to have participation in the governance they should acquire tokens in the secondary market and delegate them to a candidate of theirs. If it is implicit to assign part of the PO token to their delegate and the reasons are approved by the governance in voting it seems to me appropriate since that is what governance is for, just as you can not approve and reject any proposal that has this kind of objective. 3- The protocols can have delegates in the governance, even there are already delegates that represent some protocols. I don\u2019t see it bad at all, they can even ask to be delegated or have their treasuries buy OP tokens and delegate the taken ones to them to have more participation in this governance. In conclusion, these are my opinions and I will always want the best for this governance. In the future I may change my mind if there is a better proposal regarding self-delegated tokens received by the governance. At the end of the day these proposals may be approved in a vote, but that is a decision made by the collective as a whole. ",

I think at this point almost all of us agree that it is not ethically correct.  That this statement is incorrect is the point I\u2019ve been shouting into the void: this is based on a flawed premise, that everyone understands that governance tokens aren\u2019t always for governance. It is highly likely that several protocols omitted any mention of governance power because they assumed that their tokens would carry it. Otherwise you would have seen many more proposals ask for it, not 0 or maybe 1. So yes, it\u2019s flatly incorrect that we \u201call agree\u201d omitting mention of governance usage is unethical (for instance, of the ~10 people who have weighed in here, at least Gabagool and I disagree), and it\u2019s highly problematic that a handful of forum participants think they can definitively claim without precedent or consensus that protocols already granted OP under a set of different assumptions now aren\u2019t entitled to the full use of OP tokens.  2- Can protocols include in their proposals to allocate a % of the OP tokens received to governance?

Okay, phew. Now that I know it was you who was responsible for the quote above, I can comfortably say that your position is inconsistent because what you outlined to Maker was the incorrect presumption that they in fact could not even ask for governance power because that\u2019s \u201cnot what this was for.\u201d I think this was damaging to Optimism\u2019s credibility and a missed opportunity for Maker to lend their considerable expertise to governance. Overall, without backing, you and others have claimed to represent what was or was not allowed as part of this distribution, and that\u2019s affected existing grantees\u2019 actions. That people were doing it before this very thread was posted, one saying \u201chey we shouldn\u2019t let them do this,\u201d is problematic. That people in this thread proposing it! are treating it as already settled precedent without considering the consequences of this position is doubly so. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m having trouble understanding your second paragraph here, but it seems like you\u2019re making a very thoughtful point.  In conclusion, these are my opinions and I will always want the best for this governance.

At the end of the day these proposals may be approved in a vote, but that is a decision made by the collective as a whole.  I appreciate your statement here and acknowledge there\u2019s room for all of us to grow as part of this experiment. I\u2019m pushing back on you here because I find the opinions I\u2019m reading to be based on flawed presumptions, but I think we all agree that we\u2019re trying to get to the right answer. ",

De lo contrario habr\u00edas visto muchas m\u00e1s propuestas pedirlo, no 0 o quiz\u00e1s 1.   The cards can be used for anything. It must be clear in the proposal what they are to be used for.

Ahora que s\u00e9 que fue usted el responsable de la cita anterior, puedo decir c\u00f3modamente que su posici\u00f3n es inconsistente porque lo que le explic\u00f3 a Maker fue la suposici\u00f3n incorrecta de que, de hecho, ni siquiera pod\u00edan solicitar el poder de gobierno porque eso \"no es lo que esto era para. Creo que esto fue perjudicial para la credibilidad de Optimism y una oportunidad perdida para que Maker prestara su considerable experiencia a la gobernanza. En general, sin respaldo, usted y otros han afirmado representar lo que estaba permitido o no como parte de esta distribuci\u00f3n, y eso afect\u00f3 las acciones de los beneficiarios existentes. Que la gente lo estuviera haciendo antes de que se publicara este mismo hilo, uno diciendo \u201coye, no deber\u00edamos dejar que hagan esto\u201d, es problem\u00e1tico. \u00a1Que la gente de este hilo lo proponga! est\u00e1n trat\u00e1ndolo como un precedente ya establecido sin considerar las consecuencias de esta posici\u00f3n es doblemente as\u00ed. Me temo que tengo problemas para entender tu segundo p\u00e1rrafo aqu\u00ed, pero parece que est\u00e1s expresando un punto muy reflexivo.   This is expressed here     Defi_LATAM_axlvaz:  1- Antes que nada aclaro que no soy delegado, ni miembro de la Fundaci\u00f3n Optimismo. Soy miembro activo de este gobierno y de la comunidad DefiLatam y OptimismESP (no - oficial). 2- Como cualquier miembro de este gobierno como part\u00edcipe del mismo, doy mi opini\u00f3n personal sobre las propuestas de la FASE 0,1\u2026 Cualquier otro miembro puede estar de acuerdo o en desacuerdo con mis opiniones, lo que no significa que las m\u00edas sean de ley. Cualquier miembro puede dar su opini\u00f3n. 3- Las propuestas reciben la retroalimentaci\u00f3n de los delegados y de los miembros gubernamentales. Para que cualquiera pueda defender cualquier punto en particular, la decisi\u00f3n final siempre se toma en Instant\u00e1nea.   Still, I will respond again. Both Maker and any protocol can do what we are doing, open a debate. In that particular case I gave my \u201copinion\u201d on the proposal, I issued an opinion, it is not an order. In all the comments you refer to me as if I speak for the government, I am just someone who is interested in the good of this government. If there is something in my \u201copinion\u201d that you guys don\u2019t like, we can always enter into debate. On the other hand, I always express my opinion within what the operations manual allows. And if you know the rules of phase postulation, both Maker and other protocols you can resubmit a proposal and even change your proposal to take it to a grant and get it approved. As I said before, the will of the collective is expressed in the snapshot, not with my opinion. ",

I am of the opinion that protocols should participate in governance, and in fact, think that the token house is indeed vulnerable to governance attacks down the road if the major protocols living on it are not active participants of governance. If the issue is that they didn\u2019t explicitly state it in their proposal that they plan to delegate their idle OP from phase 0, I think it\u2019s too early to judge them on it since they haven\u2019t clearly violated their original proposal. Now if they were to never distribute their OP allocation and strictly use the OP to vote for more OP tokens for them selves or something that would constitute a governance attack. I reject @polynya\u2019s insinuation that this is a \u201cde-facto governance attack\u201d in it\u2019s current form and would invite the other active delegates of this forum to tone down their rhetoric as well. The precedent being set here is that if a project were to make any changes to their token distribution plan from the governance fund, that they are violating OP governance and should be blacklisted in the token house. So what if a project decides to re-direct incentives within their allocation or re-design their token distribution plan in light of new data or a lack of effectiveness in the original incentives plan? Are we to say that anything not explicitly stated in the original proposal is deemed a mis-use of funds? After reading this thread I am unable to gauge the sentiment around those things. On a another note, with the sheer volume of proposals coming through, I don\u2019t find it reasonable that the fate of all those proposals be decided by an extremely small portion of the voting supply and by the handful of delegates who are active here. Personally I have more faith in Perp Protocol\u2019s delegate voting genuinely and beneficially for the token house than I do in some random delegates who \u201clike Optimism\u201d but have no real tangible incentive alignment with Optimism. To sum things up, I would appreciate some clarity from those who had strong feelings on this topic to detail what the main concerns are, so at least there is some consensus to go off after reading this long thread.

Ahora, si nunca distribuyeran su asignaci\u00f3n de OP y usaran estrictamente el OP para votar por m\u00e1s tokens de OP para ellos mismos o algo que constituir\u00eda un ataque de gobierno. rechazo@polynyaLa insinuaci\u00f3n de que se trata de un \u201cataque a la gobernabilidad de facto\u201d en su forma actual e invitar\u00eda a los otros delegados activos de este foro a bajar el tono de su ret\u00f3rica tambi\u00e9n.   Here it depends on the flexibility of each one, let\u2019s imagine that all projects do the same and use the inactive tokens from the OP for different activities as long as they don\u2019t \u201cviolate the original proposal\u201d, it would be very difficult to follow and verify that each one complies with its original proposal. I think this would blur the main goal of governance and open the door to constant cheating.     millie:  El precedente que se establece aqu\u00ed es que si un proyecto hiciera alg\u00fan cambio en su plan de distribuci\u00f3n de tokens del fondo de gobierno, estar\u00eda violando el gobierno de OP y deber\u00eda estar en la lista negra de la casa de tokens. Entonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 sucede si un proyecto decide redirigir los incentivos dentro de su asignaci\u00f3n o redise\u00f1ar su plan de distribuci\u00f3n de tokens a la luz de nuevos datos o la falta de efectividad en el plan de incentivos original? \u00bfDebemos decir que cualquier cosa que no se establezca expl\u00edcitamente en la propuesta original se considera un mal uso de los fondos?

Protocols can always reapply for another application, and they can also propose a tokenization change through governance, I don\u2019t see any problem here. If they want to change they can propose it and bring it to a vote. If they want more OP tokens they can reapply for the next phase     millie:  En otra nota, con el gran volumen de propuestas que llegan, no me parece razonable que el destino de todas esas propuestas sea decidido por una porci\u00f3n extremadamente peque\u00f1a de los votantes y por el pu\u00f1ado de delegados que est\u00e1n activos aqu\u00ed. Personalmente, tengo m\u00e1s fe en que los delegados de Perp Protocol voten de manera genuina y beneficiosa por la casa de fichas que en algunos delegados aleatorios a los que \u201cles gusta el optimismo\u201d pero que no tienen un incentivo tangible real alineado con el optimismo.   Proposals are on the forum for at least 2 weeks, sometimes even longer, no great activity is required. It is also part of the commitment made by the delegates when they applied to the forum. See here. So I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with a delegate fulfilling the commitment they made, just like other delegates who don\u2019t, we can\u2019t force them to spend time on governance.     millie:  Para resumir, agradecer\u00eda un poco de claridad por parte de aquellos que tienen fuertes sentimientos sobre este tema para detallar cu\u00e1les son las principales preocupaciones, por lo que al menos hay cierto consenso para continuar despu\u00e9s de leer este largo hilo.   I think it\u2019s clear, protocols have to be clear what the OP tokens are going to be used for, that\u2019s what the application template is for. The final decision is always in the snapshot. ",

Perhaps proposals for funding should be structured and paid out so there is no funds sitting idle but that\u2019s another topic altogether. Right now governance power seems quite concentrated. Perhaps allowing this would help to change this? But since this seems to be a hot topic and already debated a lot here, would it not make sense to make it part of the proposal template?

As @lefterisjp says, it might even be a good thing for project teams who have received funding from Optimism to have some say in the governance, not only does it help decentralize power amongst more different people, but they are going to be teams that we\u2019ve already assessed as being well aligned with Optimism. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think an optimal outcome has grant recipients instantly having a multiple times bigger say than the biggest delegates, who are each representing about 12k users. While Perp have done the right thing and undelegated now the issue has been brought to light, we do probably need to address the issue in a way that doesn\u2019t rely on the honest actions of unknown individuals. From what I understand there is no way to blacklist addresses from SnapShot votes, therefore a harmful governance attack from other recipients in the future seems like a very real possibility if we don\u2019t come up with a solution.

(Shoutout primarily to @jackanorak) We are deeply engaged in Optimism\u2019s growth, we are an Optimism native protocol, and have been trusted to a large degree by OP Labs to help fulfill the promise of more users and more liquidity. It would seem to me (and yes, I am deeply biased) that we are exactly the sort of people that Optimism would WANT to participate in Governance. We happen to have ~3m OP tokens, tokens that were granted to us separate from any governance process. But because of community discomfort about protocol\u2019s self-delegating - in any amount - we have zero stake in governance voting & decision making. To me, this is a missed opportunity. Are there risks here? Yes, teams could act maliciously, teams could self-serve. But these are risks regardless of self-delegation. Our alternative option is to aggressively campaign for people to shift their delegation to us. I\u2019m all for including $OP delegation plans in funding proposals, I\u2019m all for implementing a process. But I can\u2019t help but feel like what we witnessed in this thread is a small number of people gate-keeping what is meant to be a decentralized governance process, with no clear positive outcome. IMO having PERP as partners in governance would have strengthened the Optimism Collective. We lost those voices and votes, and missed an opportunity to have protocol level involvement in governance decisions in the process. What have we gained? ",

Now consider all the liquidity mining that teams have proposed to date (I\u2019m soon going to propose an updated state of grants), and now there is a huge leak in transparency relative to protocol-owned votepower. I\u2019d argue that retroactively allowing teams to self-delegate is a vote for transparency in addition to what I hope is a broadly shared belief that projects have a unique perspective to share to the collective and are legitimate stakeholders in this community.

As long as we are fighting towards a common goal and not with each other, gov will win. Believe me, like you, I want more delegate and users participation in our gov process but instead of locking 25%, how about this ? from total voting power available, project can request for max X% of voting power as self-delegate. This percentage can be decided with a proposal. Keeping in mind that, it should not be permanent. Problem with 25% is that its quite relative, a project asking for 1M OP token and self-delegating 25% will put them in top  10 while another project asking for 300K will put them into top 80-90 range.
