If this EIP get\u2019s accepted it would be included probably around London, with EIP-2929 already merged, maybe we can consider a higher value for the initial hardcoded block gas limit? ",

I think this is also an important step towards the merge for a couple of reasons:  Control of block size will move from miners to stakers and while we\u2019ve seen miners act responsibly and work well with core devs about block sizes, it\u2019s much less known what stakers will do Currently mining pools effectively control the block size but solo staking is much more viable and common than solo mining because rewards are paid smoothly even for a single validator. This may make it very difficult to coordinate desired block size changes in the future.  ",

If this proposal had been implemented in Istanbul, the constant would have been 10m, and the gas price would be much higher than it is currently. This constant, like the difficulty bomb, would need to be micro-managed every hard fork, and, in my observation, core developers are very bad at estimating possible throughput. But I can support removing it from miner control since they have a propensity toward keeping it far below capacity to manage their operating costs. We could consider instead increasing the gas target when it is often exceeded, as that is evidence that miners could handle a higher limit. A higher uncle rate could signal DoS and push down the gas target. ",
