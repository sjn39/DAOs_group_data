Criteria Markdown files need to be created for every previous vote and should follow the format of the Stability Fee Adjustment files found in the community repo. They will eventually live in https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/votes The data can be mined from blog.makerdao.com and mkr.tools. Interested? If you feel you, or your team, is capable of handling this task please feel free to ask questions in this thread, reach out to [email\u00a0protected], or DM me in the chat @rich.brown. Funding will be provided through the Grants Program framework. ",
