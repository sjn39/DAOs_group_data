It may be that some projects include token launches as part of their funding proposals to the Token House, which we then seek to hold them to, though ultimately this is down to the individual projects to decide and we can\u2019t really enforce against them. I also expect most projects launching on Optimism won\u2019t be native to Optimism (at least in the early days), so likely won\u2019t airdrop their token to OP holders. ",
