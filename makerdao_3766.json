Core Unit Name Strategic Marcomms CPM-001  Budget The budget is roughly 2.8 percent of the Maker protocol\u2019s revenue (based on Makerburn estimate as of June), which is below the industry average of 10 percent. Together with PR communications, marketing communications function as revenue drivers. The proposed budget is based on industry data and estimates made after consulting with experts and service providers from finance, accounting, legal, marketing, and PR. The budget consists of the following: People: The Strategic Marcomms unit consists of individuals with many years of experience in marketing and PR. They are professionals who possess the know-how and in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies and understand the complexity of marketing in the crypto space. The estimates are within the compensation range stated in reports published by HR consulting agencies based on job levels and experience. The table below gives an overview of the number of people who plan to join the unit and the number of people we need to hire.  Marketing includes contributors focusing on marketing campaigns, sponsorship, and ads. Community leads are responsible for outreach programs such as ambassador programs and translations. They focus on community building by providing educational content and organizing events that generate leads for partnerships. PR, Communications, and Content include media outreach, PR agency management, content coordination, and written content. We plan to add one social media specialist based in the U.S. and a community lead for China.       Current To hire     Marketing 2 2   Community building 2    PR, Communications & Content 3    Facilitator 1    Admin  1   Total 8 3    Marketing & PR: This budget covers upcoming marketing campaigns, advertising, and PR agencies in locations we identify as top markets that can provide relatively high ROI. It also includes joint promotions with potential partners in major markets such as the U.S., Japan, and the EU. The budget ensures we sponsor the most significant events and host educational and exciting events for potential users. Programs: This budget is aimed at reaching out to new audiences. It includes the initiatives listed below:  Ambassador program Translation Research Community management Outreach (Podcast and Clubhouse are consideration)  Administration: The Core Unit aims to set up a company in Singapore registered as a company. This budget includes expenses including entity setup, accounting, audit, website maintenance, and IT subscriptions. It also includes travel expenses for the team for speaking engagements post-COVID. Legal & Consultation: This budget ensures the unit has a global legal counsel on retainer, in addition to hiring counsels for crucial jurisdictions such as the U.S., Japan, and the EU. It also includes consultant fees for people, communications, and marketing. Incentives: We are not proposing any MKR compensation at this stage. We plan to follow the same formula proposed by the SES core unit at a later stage. For details, see budget.

I believe more of the \u201cmake a plan to X\u201d stuff is being fleshed out as we speak. I think, however, that Maker is getting to the point where it needs a strong campaign to brand us as adult, sophisticated, responsible financiers. Given the demonstrated history of this proposed unit to compromise in the face of criticism, and the bizarre lack of understanding from the only other proposed unit\u2026 I think we should give them a shot. If it doesn\u2019t work out or they can\u2019t deliver something tangible,  we can certainly reign in expenses at each quarter\u2019s budget request. ",

If only a reputable financial newspaper (WSJ, FT or the Economist) would cover Maker. A biographical focus on Rune plus the story of the DAO could be interesting, perhaps as a longer-form WSJ Weekend story. But the downside is the DAO becomes more of a regulatory target. I tend to think that this sort of publicity if messaged right would be good.

Introduction Strategy Target Audience and Markets Roadmap Budget Team FAQ Hiring   Removed Moonshot Fund from the proposal Reduced budget by 16% to 3.98 million DAI.  We have also added in the budget proposal that unused fund under the marketing category (Column C, D, E, H, I, and L) will either be returned or rolled over at the yearend. That\u2019s up to 1.46 million DAI under the marketing category.   ",

Do not imply that you speak for all MKR Holders.     Deimos:  when we have a collateral we start with a low debt ceiling can we do the same for the core units   While this is possible in some cases, it will not be possible in all cases. Some Core Units will be more expensive than others. This will be especially true in the future if we want to hire an existing organization as a Core Unit.     Deimos:  can we please require some quality or at least start with a low budget and show some proof of competence then increase the budget   Can you be very specific about what you would want to see in order to vote in favour of this proposal rather than being this vague. The problem with this feedback is that it\u2019s very hard to action. What would \u2018some quality\u2019 involve for you? ",
