Uniswap is somewhat already supported on those chains in the same way the torn token is not completely censored.

It\u2019s not that much about allowing profit from stacking since mass stacking for the thousands of supported tokens is there but exchanging. So either the supply side doesn\u2019t matter for being able to exchange or if it matters it\u2019s yet another argument in order to add support to the \u1d1c\u026a (in order to be able to withdraw it).
