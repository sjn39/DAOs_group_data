Last Modification: N/A (new subdomain)   Github Repository: endgame-docs  Asset Type: Github Repository Asset Owner: DAI Foundation Platform Manager: TechOps Core Unit Content Manager: GovAlpha Core Unit ([email\u00a0protected]) Purpose: To host endgame-related reference and explanatory material. Last Modification: N/A (new github repository)   Supporters @prose11 @0xDeniz @juan  Reason for Modification This subdomain is being requested because GovAlpha intends to spread awareness and understanding of the Endgame plan in a semi-official capacity. I believe that one of the reasons MakerDAO is struggling to get traction on many of the endgame changes is due to a lack of a durable and maintainable written source of truth. The github repository is already in use, and has been retroactively included here as we have not published an Agreed Modification of Management for it previously. GovAlpha intends to produce and maintain this documentation in a similar manner to the governance manual at manual.makerdao.com. We are initially trying to meet these goals:  The documentation should reflect the most recent public, written communication about the endgame plan. It may or may not cover changes that have only been shared in private or public calls. The documentation should primarily serve as an accurate and up-to-date reference for members of MakerDAO working on the endgame plan, with the above caveat. The documentation should secondarily introduce new users (within MakerDAO or without) to the endgame plan.  An early and incomplete version of this documentation can be found on our staging site here. We are aware that the documentation is currently inaccurate due to recently communicated changes to the endgame plan. We\u2019re not terribly precious about using the endgame.makerdao.com URL. If anyone is planning to use that URL for something else endgame-related, we are happy to use \u2018endgame-docs.makerdao.com\u2019 instead, please just get in touch. ",
