                    "content": " Suggestions for Community Discussion: Innovating MakerDAO\u2019s Token Model  Note: this post was co-authored and edited with invaluable contributions from @luca_pro and members of the a16z team, including Miles Jennings, Jeff Amico, Robert Hackett and Sonal Chokshi. Special thanks to @kurt_barry and @andrew_hall for their feedback, original ideas, and insights on specific sub-proposals, and to all the MakerDAO community members who contributed to this post in some form or fashion!  Overview  Over the years, DAI has grown to become the most widely used and trusted decentralized stablecoin in DeFi, with an outstanding supply hovering near $10B. Such success has been achieved due to an engaged community, a collaborative mindset, and an ever-evolving approach to innovation. As the system evolves, the MakerDAO community may be able to further accelerate this success with an upgraded tokenomics model that could increase the utility functionality of the MKR token, foster greater voter engagement, build deeper resiliency into the system, and better reflect MakerDAO\u2019s value proposition in the market.  Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 10.20.17 AM1458\u00d7608 64 KB  The current MKR tokenomics model. The current governance and economic model of the MKR token reflects broader values versus aiming for short-term profit maximization. Currently, Maker\u2019s profits are used to replenish a System Surplus Buffer and, when in excess, to buy back and burn MKR tokens in a permissionless way. So far, more than 22,000 MKR tokens have been burned. However, as others have pointed out, given historical statistical analysis and current market conditions, the buy-and-burn model may not be best suited to achieve the community\u2019s desired long-term impact for MKR token holders and the DAO. Although this could be due to other market-based factors, the proposals below suggest that these hard-earned resources could instead be retained and used more productively within MakerDAO to accelerate growth of the public goods offered in the Maker ecosystem. Additionally, the protocol could integrate more new use cases for the MKR token that can reinforce MakerDAO\u2019s core strengths \u2013 better aligning all actors in the system. Innovating MKR\u2019s tokenomics model. The following proposals are suggestions for maximizing value creation, creating new utility for the MKR token, adding an additional (yield-bearing) layer of financial resiliency, and increasing the durability and efficiency of governance processes. We are submitting three separate discussion threads as follow-on action items to this post to ensure rich community discussion and engagement with the specific ideas in each, although it may be useful to also read all of them together. The three proposals suggest: (1) Creating new utility functionality for MKR tokens through additional capital buffers in off-chain financing structures; founding a secondary, yield-bearing insurance fund as an additional layer behind the Surplus Buffer (the \u201cSecondary Surplus Buffer\u201d); and implementing pro-MKR incentives for certain auctions in MakerDAO. (2) Increasing voter engagement and alignment through a new MKR vesting bonus system for delegates and voters; reduced voting requirements based on enabling more operational flexibility to the Core Units within community-prescribed limits; and creating a new MakerDAO governance dashboard through a community grant. (3) Increasing the System Surplus Buffer, to begin aligning it to calculated, vault-specific, expected losses related to credit and liquidation risk, as the primary insurance pool for MakerDAO. In the web3 ethos, rather than being prescriptive or conclusive, this post and its subsequent proposals are meant to serve as an initial touchstone for engaging in debate on these fundamental topics. We certainly do not have all the answers, nor could we, and we are abstaining from participating in votes related to the proposal to ensure no one party has undue influence or any potential conflicts of interest in the governance process. Changing the tokenomics of a project as successful as MakerDAO is a deliberate and collaborative process involving all stakeholders, and one that we believe should be approached progressively, in stages. This post offers some possible steps in that direction. We look forward to hearing new ideas that will help to drive MakerDAO forward!
