                    "content": "Happy birthday, beacon chain  : ! Two years after your launch, you\u2019re now successfully serving as the consensus layer for the entire Ethereum network  !  The Merge moved us from \u201ceth1\u201d & \u201ceth2\u201d to a single, unified Ethereum network, but there are still process bits outside the network that need to be harmonized. One of these is naming! On the execution layer, we\u2019ve been using devcon cities to name upgrades (with a shoutout to EthCC for paris). On the consensus layer, star names are used. There is value in keeping separate names to identify the specific EL & CL specs corresponding to a specific upgrade, but for end users having a single upgrade with two names is confusing. Luckily, the first time this happened we had \u201cThe Merge\u201d we could use in announcements rather than \u201cThe Paris/Bellatrix Fork\u201d. But now, we\u2019re looking at \u201cShanghai/Capella\u201d and \u201cCancun/???\u201d coming, which are both terrible monikers for upgrades. I would therefore like to propose moving to a new naming scheme which uses a single term to describe the high-level upgrade (like \u201cThe Merge\u201d did) and has related terms to describe the individual EL & CL specs (like Shanghai/Capella). I think a good theme for this is \u201cstructures with sub-components\u201d. For example, you can imagine a naming scheme being \u201cPlanets and their stars\u201d, where the planets refer to the high level upgrade (like \u201cThe Merge\u201d) and EL and CL releases are each identified with a star name corresponding to this planet. Another theme could be \u201cgenus & species\u201d (e.g. the Cavia upgrade with the Aperea EL & Porcellus CL releases)\u2026 there are many possibilities here! Feedback welcome on both the high-level idea and specific suggestions of themes  ",

                    "content": "By moving on from the current system, we can pay homage to Ethereum\u2019s history, while working toward something unique that can be long-standing, and that meets the goal of representing both layers as \u201cparts of a whole\u201d. On the first note, the original Ethereum roadmap included the four stages: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity. Frontier and Homestead were delivered, as was Metropolis, albeit in three stages (Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul). The final stages of that original vision included a complete proof-of-stake and sharding. Relatedly, EIP-4844 marks the start of sharding, after Shanghai closes out the PoS upgrade and withdrawals. This makes for a great opportunity to finally close that original chapter. I\u2019d first propose that the name of Serenity be applied to the EIP-4844 upgrade, marking an end to the celestial naming scheme that\u2019s touched both the original roadmap and the current CL forks, before moving forward to a greener future. For the future naming scheme proposal, an initial idea was to choose something that reflected the CL/EL, while having a parent-name that solidifies the relationship between two parts of one whole. For example, if one upgrade package was dubbed \u201cPurple\u201d, upgrades within it would consist of two sides, with one layer designated as \u201cBlue\u201d and the other \u201cRed\u201d. There were a number of potential ideas discussed here (stars, sister cities, rivers), some of which I\u2019ll include below. But these days, one of Ethereum\u2019s unique powers is its ability to continue to develop independently of any original plans and roadmaps, founders, or a few OGs. This natural growth (combined with \u201cgarden\u201d mantras that have taken root and the PoS narrative meshing well with a greener/cleaner system) led to exploration of botanical or ecological schemes. Specifically, I\u2019d propose to make use of families of trees and species within those families to accomplish many of the goals set out above (reflecting on life, ecology, evolution, strength\u2026). There are enough unique families and varieties to apply to upgrades for years or decades to come. Examples, like Fir and Cedar as two sides of a package dubbed \u201cPinaceae\u201d would do well to convey this natural relationship in a unique way. There\u2019s enough diversity to (a) move in alphabetical order and/or to (b) skip specific species if/when there\u2019s something too odd to include a name, or to (c) include more than two names for upgrades that require multiple steps. Some even come with their own (controversy-free) emojis   !  And on ordering, Latin names can be used as something more neutral if/when English names are less of a fit. Tl;dr suggestion: After Shanghai, sharding begins with the Serenity upgrade, which pays homage to Ethereum\u2019s history (past and present) and closes an important chapter before moving forward. Going into the future thereafter with something that reflects biodiversity, evolution and connectedness, like tree-species and families, encompasses Ethereum\u2019s natural growth (merkle trees anyone?), uniqueness, diversity, and the green future created by the work put into bringing the Beacon Chain and Merge to life. \u2013 JS Initial ideations: A. Binary Star systems.   Package: System   EL: Star A   CL: Star B   Reasoning against: Celestial names have been used for the CL and by many Cosmos and other chains. We can do more to be original and aligned here. B. Major Rivers/Cities   Package: Major River (e.g. Nile, Rhine, or Tigris)   EL: City A (e.g. Cairo, Bonn, Baghdad)   CL: City B (e.g. Giza, Cologne, Mosul)   Reasoning against: While this version (suggested by Peri) is my favorite alternative to the above, this suggestion also gets caught in our current city-scheme that\u2019s been used for the better part of a decade. There\u2019s been pushback against flags and nationalism related to upgrades as well. C. Planets & Largest Moons   Package: Planet (e.g. Mars)   EL: Moon A (e.g. Phobos)   CL: Moon B (e.g. Deimos)   Discussed and suggested by Tim above, this is solid and unique with many options, but continues the celestial track. Thanks to Tim, Pari, Peter and others for their input!! ",

Using a mixed name is a good one but I don\u2019t like it because everyone will have to keep three names in mind when talking about two-layer HF. Note that we will run out of Devcon city names in case of >1 HF per year. Devcons to be happening in locations defined by EL\u2019s HF names is one of potential solutions to this problem. ",

                    "content": "    timbeiko:  I would therefore like to propose moving to a new naming scheme which uses a single term to describe the high-level upgrade (like \u201cThe Merge\u201d did) and has related terms to describe the individual EL & CL specs (like Shanghai/Capella). I think a good theme for this is \u201cstructures with sub-components\u201d.   Please can we just stick with what we have for the execution and consensus layers?  We already have a history of past names and a plan for future names, so any change will cause disruption and add to the technical debt of the ecosystem. Naming things is hard, because we don\u2019t know what the future brings so cannot pick something that will work well with future changes (Ethereum is a good example of this).  But consistency brings its own benefits, and reduces the mental load when coming in to the Ethereum space.  Taking the consensus layer as an example, we are now on a path \u201cA,B,C,\u2026\u201d for each hard fork, which makes it very easy for someone coming in to the space to know the ordering of the hard forks.  Execution layer requires a bit of tribal knowledge, but that is now a given and not going to change so the best we can do is not to increase their burden but having multiple systems that happen at different points in time. As for having a user-facing name for the upgrades, I maintain that the best solution here is to talk about the execution layer name and not the consensus layer.  Anything that is consensus layer-specific is likely to only matter to validators, and they are generally speaking more aware of the difference between the layers and understanding of what is activated when (the BLS to execution change operations are a good example of this).  If we consider users to be those that may generate execution layer transactions, or benefit from execution layer transactions, then the thing they care about is upgrades in the execution layer so that it is what we should be talking about.

This proposal specifies a scheme \"Bytewords\" with similar ends but:  * Encodes a [CBOR] structure tagged with the data type [URTYPES], and is therefore self-describing. * Uses a dictionary of exactly 256 English words with a uniform word size of 4 letters. * Only two letters of each word (the first and last) are required to uniquely identify each byte value, making a minimal Bytewords encoding as efficient as hexadecimal (2 characters per byte) and yet less error prone. * Additionally, words can be uniquely identified by their first three letters or last three letters. * Representing each byte as a single word simplifies encoder and decoder architecture. * Minimizing the number of letters for each word simplifies transfer to permanent media such as stamped metal.
