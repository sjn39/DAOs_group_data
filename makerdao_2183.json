                    "content": " Update  CES is producing a new registry for the Maker Protocol focused on storing ancillary RWA smart contracts. The registry leaves https://chainlog.makerdao.com/ for managing only the core protocol smart contracts. A forum post explaining how this will work is available here and an executive vote to deploy it will be scheduled for later in Q1. CES has been in coordination with other CUs in terms of supporting the GUSD and USDP needs. We remain on hold and ready quickly to respond to technical work as required. CES remains in communication with Monetalis on MIP81 and has discussed on-chain and off-chain safeguards that can be put in place to ensure Coinbase permissions over the safebox contract are favorable for MakerDAO. We also reviewed the draft legal agreement to ensure the wording clearly defines the features of the safebox contract. MIP92 work has started. Integration discussions among CUs and Yearn are taking place. CES will deliver a Token Assessment and Protocol Assessment. We will review the Base Strategy contract, but will not go into assessing the specific strategy implementations for each protocol that Maker Governance decides to deploy capital to. We are in coordination with @Risk-Core-Unit in terms of discussing strategies and requirements that need to be taken into consideration. CES provided a first draft document of the Governance Security Scope Framework that was shared to a working group which is meeting frequently to discuss contents and next steps in order to get the document into a state in which it can be publicly shared for feedback. The CSI, CMON implementation and CMOFF implementation google sheets have been handed over to @Risk-Core-Unit and @strat-fin-core-unit. We continue to attend the Collateral Management meetings. Risk is currently facilitating the meeting with operational support provided by CES. We remain close to the Endgame development and working on positioning CES as an Ecosystem Actor. We are taking the necessary operational steps to enable the team to continue providing support to MakerDAO on the Pre-game technical needs and also later during the Endgame.   CU Management & Operations   All budget statements for the history of CES (dating back to October 2021) have been uploaded to the MakerDAO Expenses Dashboard.
