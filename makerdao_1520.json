Given my level of involvement up to this point, if I don\u2019t really know what HVB is, it\u2019s fairly likely that most DAI holders don\u2019t know what it is either, and this could well be true for a number of DAI\u2019s backing assets, both on-chain and off-chain. What would be ideal for me and users of DAI (and others besides) would be a simple and concise description of the various assets backing DAI. I\u2019ve decided to coordinate such an initiative, and produce human and machine readable documentation that can be included in various resources, such as the Maker Operational Manual, and frontends like Makerburn. This documentation would include a sentence and paragraph summary of each collateral alongside a URL linking to more information. It would be really useful if those who are more in the know such as members of @collateral-core-unit and @Real-World-Finance could share a succinct explanation for some of the assets listed below. Alternatively, if the asset originators themselves want to comment, please feel free. I\u2019m going for a pretty basic level of explanation here, so if possible, breaking down credit tenant leases / commercial loans / fix and flips to a more everyday and finance illiterate level would be useful. If you don\u2019t have time to write a description, resource links would also be appreciated. These are the assets I\u2019d appreciate help with.  NS-DROP RWA001 / 6s FFT1-DROP HTC-DROP CF-DROP HVBank  Thank you! (@mrabino1 / @g_dip / @spin / @prankstr25 feel free to comment, but no obligation, apologies if I\u2019ve missed anyone that would have appreciated inclusion ) Edit: Apparently RWF is just Will now. So @christiancdpetersen @teej @eumenes get a ping too. ",

If I had to try to put one together for New Silver it might be something like: \u201cShort term (average 12-month duration) loans financing the purchase, renovation and sale of single family homes in the United States.\u201d I suspect there should be more to that though, because it doesn\u2019t really cover the construction part, nor does it really touch on the protections that the loans have? It also doesn\u2019t really answer the question of what is backing the DAI, is it the residential assets themselves, is it the balance of interest paid on non-defaulting loans versus defaulting loans, something else?

                    "content": "TLDR for HVBank: HVBank is a US, publicly traded commercial bank with a diversified portfolio of loans spanning the Philly/Pennsylvania area. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as a \u201ccommunity bank\u201d because it is on the ground originating loans within a relatively small region. Community banks are the unsung heroes of the US economy. in my opinion, as they help small businesses to grow and prosper. The way this facility works is quite simple. Maker funds a Delaware Trust with dollars (Dai is converted to dollars upon minting) and this Trust is authorized via pre-written agreements (that can only be amended by a MKR vote) to purchase loans from HVBank. While the Dai is not explicitly backed by these loans, i.e. Dai holders will never find themselves holding a piece of a loan in an ES, it is supported by the value in these loans as they can be sold or allowed to mature at any time to repay the Dai to the Vault.
