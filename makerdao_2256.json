Background Over the past week, the collapse of first Silvergate and then earlier today Silicon Valley Bank has thrown the banking industry into crisis. In particular, centralized stablecoins may face significant impairment due to their high exposures to impacted banks as well as other potentially at risk institutions. Only the first $250,000 of bank deposits are insured by the FDIC, with the vast majority of stablecoins\u2019 bank deposits representing unsecured deposits to underlying banks. These funds are more senior than bank equity and bonds, but still bear some risk of not receiving full repayment if a bank is closed. While Silvergate is voluntarily winding down with no reported losses to depositors (uninsured and insured), Silicon Valley Bank has been placed into receivership by the FDIC with the possibility of losses to uninsured depositors. Circle has reported roughly $3.3 billion in exposure to SVB, or a bit more than a quarter of their roughly $11 billion in bank deposit exposure. Certain other banks may also be at risk next week of bank runs and general contagion. The proposed changes are intended to limit Maker\u2019s exposure to potentially impaired stablecoins and other risky collaterals, while maintaining enough liquidity to prevent DAI from trading significantly above $1 if conditions change, and ensuring there is adequate market liquidity to process potential liquidations of crypto collateralized vaults.  Reasoning for Specific Changes  LP Collaterals Containing USDC These collaterals are exposed to potential USDC tail risk, and available debt ceilings are not critical to maintaining adequate DAI liquidity. Therefore, it is proposed to reduce debt ceilings (line) for each of these assets to 0 DAI: UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A.  PSM-USDC-A The USDC PSM has historically been Maker\u2019s primary liquidity sources, keeping DAI close to target price and preventing price spikes that can interfere with safe and sound liquidation of crypto collateralized vaults. However, under current conditions, excessively daily minting limits put Maker at risk of greater losses in the event that USDC vault faces impairment from underlying uninsured bank deposit exposures. We are proposing to reduce the gap parameter from current 950 million DAI to 250 million DAI (effectively reducing daily mint limits to 250 million DAI), and increasing the tin parameter to swap USDC into DAI from current 0% to 1%. The increased fee will help prevent excessive dumping of USDC into the PSM, potentially incentivizing users to dispose of USDC via other methods and ensuring it is only used if DAI price significantly diverges upwards (which could be indicative of liquidity crunch from crypto collateralized vault liquidations).  PSM-GUSD-A GUSD has not faced exposure to Silvergate or Silicon Valley Bank, but they have large uninsured bank deposit exposure which potentially could be associated with at risk institutions (specific breakdown of deposit balances by institution are not provided in attestations). To limit potential losses if Gemini faces contagion risk from their bank deposits, it is proposed to reduce gap from current 50 million to 10 million DAI.  PSM-USDP-A Paxos has relatively stronger reserve assets versus other available centralized stablecoins, consisting primarily of US treasury bills, reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US treasury bonds, insured bank deposits (placed through deposit broker networks to remain under FDIC limits), and privately insured bank deposits, with a relatively small portion of uninsured bank deposits per their latest reserves reports. They face relatively lower potential for impairment versus other available stablecoins, but can still provide important backstop liquidity to prevent DAI from trading over $1 target price and impacting liquidation safety in the event of a crypto market crash. We are proposing to increase the maximum debt ceiling line to 1 billion from current 450 million DAI, increase gap from 50 million to 250 million DAI, reduce tin from 0.2% to 0%, and increase tout from 0% to 1%. This will allow USDP to effectively provide liquidity when DAI trends above $1, while limiting arbitrage opportunities to drain stronger USDP collateral from the protocol in exchange for weaker stablecoins.  Compound v2 D3M Compound v2 uses a fixed $1 price for USDC. This presents a risk of bad debt accrual and potentially bank runs with cascading market insolvency if the market price of USDC falls significantly below the current collateral factor. We are proposing to temporarily deactivate the Compound v2 D3M and pull all funds (via setting bar to 0 via the MOM mechanism) to prevent exposure to this potential tail risk.  Aave v2 D3M While Aave v2 uses live oracle pricing so is not vulnerable to the same risk as Compound, the overall risk reward of depositing funds into the D3M are not favorable under current conditions. For this reason we are proposing to temporarily deactivate the Aave v2 D3M and pull all funds (via setting bar to 0 via the MOM mechanism) to prevent exposure to potential insolvencies.  Governance Security Module It is anticipated that Maker governance may want to make further parameter changes to account for rapidly changing market conditions over the coming days. Reducing the governance security module delay will allow for greater agility. This update should be calibrated to balance desire for quick governance action against the need to maintain vigilance and protection against potentially malicious governance proposals. A GSM delay of between 12 to 24 hours could be considered, at the discretion of the Protocol Engineering core unit.  Timeline and Next Steps Proposal(s) implementing the above changes are expected to be posted in the next ~12 hours or less. The changes may be split into several independent proposals at the discretion of the Protocol Engineering core unit, to ensure timeline implementation of the most critical updates and overall efficiency and safety. Voters are encouraged to review and support the relevant executive proposal(s) as soon as possible. Edited by Patrick to update GSM delay value in top-level post ",

(Which will significantly reduce the gains from the tin)? Let USDC_depegged be the value of 1 USDC on the event that USDC permanently loses the peg. Hence, at our current 3.5b exposure, depeg_loss = 3.5b * (1- USDC_depegged) Examples: USDC_depegged = 0.99 usd \u2192 depeg_loss = 35m USDC_depegged = 0.95 usd \u2192 depeg_loss = 175m Maybe we can survive a 1% depeg (to 0.99) but probably not much more. So what is the point of the 250m gap modification? We are already too exposed. I think it makes sense to keep the current gap and bet on the event that USDC does not depeg, and make money from the tin.

Until on chain MMFs are available and Maker can adjust the PSMs, I think this is a good required next step.

What are the goals of these changes? Are they intended to 1) limit USDC exposure, 2) generate revenue or 3) mitigate depeg risk?   limit USDC exposure, the USDC exposure would remain the same and maybe even increase at a rate of 250M daily. If MakerDao wanted to remove USDC exposure, would it be more effective to implement negative tout or to invest USDC into another asset?   generate revenue: increasing the tin fee % would partially prevent additional assets from entering the protocol, which instead could earn a yield of >2% if remaining in USDC by requesting the interest pass through Circle or >4% by investing in MMFs (although introduces redeemability concerns). would it be more beneficial to focus on requesting higher interest rates on USDC holdings and lower the fee to a more reasonable rate (e.g. 0.25%)?   mitigate depeg risk, do these changes really mitigate depeg risk? With the 73M surplus buffer, having a 4B exposure to USDC is just as much of an existential risk as any other amount above 1B. If the goal is to encourage USDC to leave the crypto system instead of entering MakerDAO, then would it be more effective to reduce USDC\u2019s balance sheet by 1) negative tout, 2) converting USDC into another stablecoin, or 3) converting USDC into MMFs?

Now that conditions have largely stabilized have time to catch my breath a bit      iammeeoh:  I am advocating for \u201ctin increase\u201d but \u201cno gap change\u201d.   This was considered but, we determined on a balance of risk basis it was better to limit rate of accumulation of USDC alongside fee increases, rather than fee increase alone. While the likelihood was deemed to be extremely remote based on analysis of USDC balance sheet, the possibility of large percentage losses on USDC could not be ruled out. Our responsibility to DAI holders is to safeguard their value according to a more logarithmic (rather than linear) utility function - this is to say, DAI holders are risk averse and may be expected to prefer taking a limited haircut and Maker no longer continuing as a going concern, versus maybe marginally higher likelihood of Maker surviving but significant risk of their holdings going all the way to zero. This seminal SBF thread (alongside subsequent history  ) is a good example of why logarithmic utility functions are more appropriate philosophical stance for a stablecoin protocol that puts the welfare of its holders as top priority.   twitter.com    SBF @SBF_FTX  1) Better is Bigger   4:19 AM - 11 Dec 2020           720                170                iammeeoh:  My request to @monet-supply was to see some actual quantitative calculations.   Our methodology was admittedly not 100% scientific due to time constraints and wanting to take a directionally correct action asap. But to summarize, we looked at our outstanding crypto vaults, assessed them against how much may be liquidated or need to repay debt given various realistic percent drops, and also considered previous daily liquidation and repayment data under stressed conditions to get a sense of what sort of liquidity might be needed to safely manage crypto vault liquidations. We ideally would have wanted to more strictly limit USDC exposure, but over the weekend minting of alternative stablecoins (particularly USDP which we identified as the stablecoin with strongest reserves and least unsecured bank deposit exposure) would have been unavailable and there was not enough already on-chain to have assurance they would be available to be used in Maker.     ChrisB:  Leaving it open soon as gap fires it will be absorbed instantly and in a market crash, demand for Dai increases but the Psm is already maxed out in the Dai it can give so how does leaving it open for 48 hours help with anything?   This is a valid point. While the PSM wasn\u2019t guaranteed to be available specifically for liquidators, releasing additional DAI into circulation to help meet demand was expected to help dampen potential for sharp upward price movement in DAI above $1 (which would have endangered vault users and liquidations).     SebVentures:  We need asap work on auditing and implementing the PSM v2 with oracles so we can use market price of USDC (capped to $1) when inflow and market price of USDC (floored by $1) when outflow.   Improvements to PSM mechanism design are definitely high on the list of priorities for increasing Maker\u2019s resilience to future crises. I\u2019m not totally sure yet if oracles are the best approach yet but look forward to working on this asap.     TRUEMAKER:  If MakerDao wanted to remove USDC exposure, would it be more effective to implement negative tout or to invest USDC into another asset?   Given recent news, I\u2019m not sure this is immediately necessary. But from operational perspective, I believe that negative tout is not possible with current PSM and a more traditional liquidation process would be used instead. But again I don\u2019t think this sort of action is appropriate at the moment, and we would also need to arrange for an alternative asset (eg USDP / GUSD / treasury bills) to absorb the DAI demand that would no longer be backed by USDC.     TRUEMAKER:  do these changes really mitigate depeg risk? With the 73M surplus buffer, having a 4B exposure to USDC is just as much of an existential risk as any other amount above 1B.   See above note discussing logarithmic vs linear utility functions. While the risk of Maker being forced to wind down may be the same assuming significant USDC impairment with 1B or 4B exposure, the potential losses to DAI holders would be much greater in the second case. I think we need to be optimizing for DAI holder security first and foremost. In theory this ultimately flows back to Maker in the form of more user loyalty, better reputation, and lower cost of capital.  Thanks to everyone for contributing to the discussion over the weekend. While we are not out of the woods quite yet I think we can begin to turn our attention from damage control towards normalization and medium term updates to improve resilience. ",

Might be ways to get around this without keepers but could be a bit complicated. Another option is protocol owned LP (eg GUNI with potentially wider range than existing options, or a Curve or Balancer stable pool) where we can choose the liquidity range/density to suit our needs based on amount of liquidity we want to provide off the peg.
