                    "content": " [Signal Request] Structuring MakerDAO  Motivation YFI now has a team of 10 paid people. On the other hand, MakerDAO don\u2019t have any paid workforce and need the Foundation to pay and manage the domain teams. This lead to the fact that the PSM is nowhere in sight and the peg staying broken for months. The Foundation want to move to a community having full control over features. That requires some finance and HR work. It was discussed since early this year at least without much visible progress.    A word on the PSM concept and next steps for the Foundation   In particular, solutions related to funding from the protocol and community controlled protocol development will help the community achieve full control over what features it wants to develop and onboard to the protocol.    Proposal The proposal is a step towards solving the MIP1c2.1 problem space: Core Governance Framework. The aim is to provide formal structure in place in order to provide a path for all future problems to be addressed efficiently. The proposal is limited to provide a way to sustain a workforce to work the ideas and execute the decisions from MakerDAO . Should this proposal be accepted, the work to be done would be:  establish a business plan for MakerDAO, collecting the expected existing expenses from the Foundation (workforce, oracles, \u2026) and modeling expected revenues. work on having a Treasury. This is related to strategic reserves but expanded with this and that. work with @LongForWisdom to bring new domain teams MIP alive and have a workforce management framework.  The idea is that each decision of MakerDAO need to have a related cost and revenue evaluation and have the workforce to make it happen with a defined timeline.  Target The outcome would be considered as:  a failure if at the start of 2021 MakerDAO (4 months after the start) doesn\u2019t have any workforce. a mild success would be having one paid person (e.g. in charge of working/developing the PSM). an outstanding success would be to have all domain teams and oracles under MakerDAO.   Who do the work Most of those issues are discussed for a long time without progress. The needed work is consequent which doesn\u2019t fit with casual governance participation. The proposal mandates a third party to conduct the work described in the proposal. People interested in doing the actual work can signal themselves in this thread so I can list them. The selection will be addressed in another poll depending on the success of this one. The compensation is decided in a following poll. The first half of the amount will be paid in January-March 2021 assuming effective work. The other half of the amount will be paid only if mild success is achieved as defined previously.  Pros  It\u2019s a first step to move forward making Maker an organization with resources (people + finance).   Cons  We might want to stay a protocol only and not bother on having those complexities and let the community sustain the project.   Signal Request Do you agree with the proposal?

                    "content": "So a few points on this:   A signal request is not the best format for proposals of this nature (non-immediate, non-specific). They are much better suited to Declarations of Intent. The reason for this is that it provides a single canonical record of exactly what is intended and why, has more weight due to going through the monthly cycle and provides a month-long period for feedback on the proposal before it is voted.   There is a mostly non-Foundation working group already pushing for this goal. I\u2019d be happy to get you onboarded into that group to help build out these structures. We\u2019re planning to explain more publicly what this group is doing and planning to do in the next few days.   You\u2019ve put a lot of effort into this, which is appreciated. That said, please don\u2019t use auto-close polls. In theory it\u2019s a great idea, but the problem with it is that it\u2019s very inflexible (polls can\u2019t be extended or reopened). For more formal on-chain polls, this is important, but for signal requests it has been a hindrance in the past.   ",
