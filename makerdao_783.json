Paragraph Summary The Events Unit MKR budget is derived from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) MKR Budget structure discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with a 1-year cliff vest. The members of this Core Unit will take the start of the Feedback Period of this MIP (March 9, 2022) as the start date for the vesting schedule.  Key Parameters     Property Value     MKR/USD Lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6-month average from March 9, 2022   MKR/USD Lock-in Price 2,442 USD   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 1 year   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR vesting   Vesting Interval 6 months   Auto-Renewal yes   MKR, 2 FTEs (Annual) 40.6 MKR   MKR, 2 FTEs (Total 3-Year) 121.8 MKR     Current Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure has been calculated using the formula given in the SES-001 MKR Incentive Plan Proposal. Calculations are based on 2 FTEs and the compensation stated in the CU DAI budget. This would result in 20.3 MKR/FTE/year.  The following is the vesting schedule for the CUs 2 FTEs over 3 years.     Vesting Date MKR Amount     March 9, 2023 40.6   Sept 9, 2023 20.3   March 9, 2024 20.3   Sept 9, 2024 20.3   March 9, 2025 20.3   Total 121.8    Any changes to these amounts will be reported in our Monthly Budget Statements and reviewed by the budget auditors.  Payment Implementation As defined in MIP40c3-SP65, the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages: Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the EVENTS-001 Operational Wallet.  Core Unit multisig wallet address: \u201c0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2\u201d  When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor either directly or through an intermediate payment processor. Any excess MKR in the EVENTS-001 Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions. This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the EVENTS-001 Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signalling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. EVENTS-001 may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and the risk is deemed acceptable by the team. ",

The Events CU will plan and execute MakerDAO branded events within it\u2019s specified mandate.  Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP66 adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit EVENTS-001: Events. This budget will allocate DAI to the CU.  The one-off seed transfer will be 149,692 DAI with the monthly transfers being 62,371.50 (12 transfers total).  The total CU budget amounts to 898,150 DAI annually.  Specification  Motivation To establish the annual operating budget for the Events CU so the team can plan, create and execute the best-branded events for MakerDAO.  Core Unit ID EVENTS-001  Budget Implementation This budget implementation is a \u201cSimple Budget Implementation\u201d under MIP40c4. Core Unit multisig wallet address: \u201c0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2\u201d  Keyholders:   @PonJerry - \u201c0x9A214CE4c8D490C78bF083939f0e0f3D9e523A56\u201d  @hexonaut - \u201c0x18CaE82909C31b60Fe0A9656D76406345C9cb9FB\u201d   One-off Seed 149,692 DAI will be transferred to \u201c0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2\u201d on May 1, 2022 2 months operating budget to cover initial startup of financial, upcoming event costs, workshop rental and visual artist retainer  Monthly Transfers 748,458 DAI will be streamed to \u201c0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2\u201d starting 2022-05-01 and ending 2023-04-30 at a rate of 62,371.50 DAI per month  Budget Breakdown The yearly budget cap request for the Events Core Unit is 898,150 DAI to support the team\u2019s mandate. This budget cap secures a team of 2 full-time employees (FTE), Event costs, Visual/Design/Lighting Artists retainers, and covers all other operational costs and contingency listed in the table below.  The mandate of the Events CU will be to execute 3 Major events and 2 Minor events per fiscal year. The budget proposed is a worst-case scenario.  At times based on Maker community feedback, event partnerships with other protocols may be arranged for the event.  During the planning phase, it would be determined how much shared expenses would be passed on to the event partner.  The passed-on expense would be reduced from the event budget cap (Major: 110,000 DAI, Minor: 48,000 DAI) and returned to the Maker protocol. At the end of the calendar year, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker protocol.  Should the Events Core Unit shut down, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately.

Major Events As the largest budgeted event item, the major events are to be held at major ETH conferences.  A major event aims to cater to 1200 to 1400 attendees.   Major events will introduce new themes, branded set dress and visuals to maintain a uniqueness from each other. Included in the major event sub budget are the following;  Travel & food expenses related to FTEs Travel & food expenses for event contractors Wages of event contractors Event set dress 2 International artists including any related costs for management fees, artist fees, travel costs, food costs and any other contractual obligations Ground transportation cost for FTEs, contractors & artists Event venue rental Event open bar costs including overages Event lighting & visual equipment rental, including operator fees Material and 3rd party labour costs of the set dress Shipping of set dress Shipping and procurement of event-related tools and equipment Event photographer Event videographer (outputs to be 1x one minute clip and 2x 30 second clips of event recap) Event security Rigging & engineering approvals The following is a major event budget framework derived from the ETH Denver Maker event;      Category Amount (DAI)     Travel (2 FTE\u2019s & 3 Contractors) $9,600.00   Accommodations/Food (2 FTE\u2019s & 3 Contractors) $10,900.00   Set Dress (Venue Branding, LED Logos/Installations, DJ Equitment Rental, Lighting Rental, New Visual 3D & 2D Stock, Visual Renderfarm, Plugins/Software) $18,000.00   Labor (3 Contractors & Translator) $4,100.00   Venue/Hospitality $28,000.00   Music/Photography/Videography $23,500.00   Misc (Shipping, COVID Tests, Onsite Tools/Equipment, Overhead, Contingency $15,900.00   Total 110,000.00     Minor Events Minor events are to be held at major or minor ETH conferences.   A minor event aims to cater to 300 to 400 attendees.   Minor events will be a scaled scope and reuse set dress from other major events.  Included in the minor event sub budget are the following;  Travel & food expenses related to FTEs Travel & food expenses for event contractors Wages of event contractors 1 local artist including any related costs for management fees, artist\u2019s fees, event day ground travel, event day food costs and any other contractual obligations Artist optional depending on event theme and setup  Ground transportation cost for FTEs, contractors & artists Event venue rental Event open bar costs including overages Event lighting & visual equipment rental, including operator fees Material and 3rd party labour costs of the set dress Shipping of pre-made/prepared set dress Shipping event-related tools and equipment Event photographer Event security  The following is a minor event budget framework derived from the ETH Amsterdam Maker event;     Category Amount (DAI)     Travel (2 FTE\u2019s & 2 Contractors) $6,500.00   Accommodations/Food (2 FTE\u2019s & 2 Contractors) $6,000.00   Set Dress (Venue Branding, DJ Equitment Rental, Lighting Rental, Visual Renderfarm, Plugins/Software) $6,000.00   Labor (2 Contractors & Translator) $2,400.00   Venue/Hospitality $15,000.00   Music/Photography $2,800.00   Misc (Shipping, COVID Tests, Onsite Tools/Equipment, Overhead, Contingency $9,300.00   Total $48,000.00     Visual/Design/Lighting Artist Retainer Major events will include new visual and lighting elements.  To facilitate the consistency of high-quality visual & lighting elements across all major events, the Events CU budget has included a retainer for a contract visual animator.  The goal is to provide the visual artist with a retainer so the commitment is locked into the entire series of major events for the fiscal year.  By doing so, the CU can ensure quality, consistency and delivery of visual elements for major events. The retainer has been calculated based on a daily rate of $555 provided by industry professionals with an estimated workload of 30 days per major event.  Overhead and Operational cost  Overhead and operation costs are include the following; Rental for workshop for set dress, lighting and visual building and testing Financial & accounting fees Social media & promotional digital content costs Packaging materials & cases for shipping set dress Rental of set dress storage space   Contingency The contingency acts as a safety buffer against any unknown or unexpected costs.  The contingency was calculated to be 15% of the entire budget.  Any unused funds would be returned to the Maker protocol.  Partnerships The Events CU plans to leverage partnerships with other protocols to offset the event costs.  Our goal for each event is to partner with other protocols to cost split.  As an example 50%-MakerDao, 25%-Partner 1, 25%-Partner 2.  MakerDao would always retain a 50% share minimum and have complete control over the creative direction and the event itself. To demonstrate how this strategy applies to the requested budget, the following is a breakdown of how the budget would look if the team is successful at cost splitting at all the planned events at 50% MakerDao and 50% Partners. Note the following is only for demonstration purposes and not the requested budget for the CU.  We feel this accurately highlights the likely spend scenario of this CU.  We have only included foreseen expenses so have not included the contingency     Budgeted Item Annually     FTE Compensation $265,000.00   Major Event 1 (50% share of requested budget) $55,000.00   Major Event 2 (50% share of requested budget) $55,000.00   Major Event 3 (50% share of requested budget) $55,000.00   Minor Event 1 (50% share of requested budget) $24,000.00   Minor Event 2 (50% share of requested budget) $24,000.00   Visual/Design/Lighting Artist Retainer $50,000.00   Overhead & Operation Costs $40,000.00       Total $568,000.00        Under this strategy, the sum of $330,150.00 from the requested budget would be returned to the DAO.
