Outer orbit is heard the name Ethereum Inner - used metamask or Ethereum Inner 2 - wrote a smart contract Inner 3- working in the ecosystem  He says his job is to pull people into the inner orbits of Ethereum at scale. I thought it was such an interesting way to think about ecosystem onboarding, that I went ahead and tried to outline what a similar model for Gitcoin looks like. Here is a simplistic one:  Screen Shot 2021-10-14 at 11.21.54 AM1096\u00d7864 65.8 KB  Building open that, if you consider where we\u2019re having a positive impact on our communities further:  Screen Shot 2021-10-14 at 11.21.49 AM1146\u00d7868 78.5 KB  Here is an orbit model that considers what  \u201cDAO of DAOs\u201d might look like.

The Orbit Model contains five fundamental concepts: Gravity, Love, Reach, Orbit Levels, and Presence.   Gravity is the attractive force of a community that acts to retain existing members and attract new ones.  Love is a member\u2019s overall level of engagement and impact in the community.  Reach is a measure of a community member\u2019s sphere of influence.  Orbit levels are a practical tool for member segmentation and help you create different programs for different types of community members.  Presence is a measure of a community member\u2019s activity over a period of time.  The goal of the Orbit Model is to increase the Gravity of your community.  Thinking about specific tasks that people can do that help them engage \u2014 but also \u201cgain influence\u201d to spread to others as Kevin has done is a useful exercise. Maybe this is a series of \u201cOnboarding\u201d tasks. The Discobot here in Discourse can even be customized to help people learn and take actions. (Don\u2019t have Discourse gravity to be allowed to post links \u2014 maybe @staff can help) ",
