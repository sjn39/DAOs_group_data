                    "content": "With MKR price flailing while all competitors and other DeFi tokens soaring, I would like to address and discuss some of the problems I see as hurdles for MakerDAO to improve upon. 1. Lack of Foundation leadership As I see it, MakerDAO has a leadership problem. This may sound harsh on paper but let me explain. I\u2019ve brought up before that I notice other platform\u2019s leaders very active in their discords and forums, constantly participating in moving actionable change forward. Kain (SNX), Robert (COMP), and Stani (Aave) are very involved in the constant changes to their respective systems. Seeing the leaders so active/passionate/involved, inspires community leadership through lead by example. It has been brought up to me on Rocket Chat before that this may be short sighted from a regulatory/legal aspect and that governments may come crack down on these people at some point in the future. What if they don\u2019t? These \u201crisk takers\u201d are iterating fast and reaping the rewards of their labour. My personal belief is that the Foundation is so afraid of regulatory oversight that they are paralyzed to participate in active governance which greatly hamstrings the production of the protocol. Playing it safe doesn\u2019t always win the race and this is becoming apparent as other projects come snapping at Maker\u2019s heals and eventually pass them. First mover advantage only lasts for so long (see BTC). 2. Lack of community participation A prime example of this is LRC onboarding being downvoted by one 17k MKR whale with total participation of 6 people. KNC KyberDAO currently has 876 people voting for BRR rewards, YAM raised 100k from the community for audits in hours, YFI has insane speed of community participation based on iteration, SNX and Aave Discords are constantly bonkers/active. What I\u2019m trying to say here is that we need to think about how we can structure this system to get people fired up and care to participate. This is an existential problem that I have seen play out for the past 2 years. Governance as it stands is pretty boring. The community isn\u2019t going to take over the reigns unless they have a financial stake, and in order for them to get one, most people don\u2019t want to have to pay, they want to earn. Farming didn\u2019t exist at the beginning so Maker went the \u201cold school\u201d route of selling tokens to VCs (ICO adjacent) but this isn\u2019t \u201csexy\u201d, and the fact that these VC\u2019s aren\u2019t active in the community is a big problem (especially if you\u2019re not leading and expect the community to be running the show at this point). 3. Lack of efficient monetary policy Let\u2019s just say it. Voting for every RP/DC/Base Rate is not efficient. Secondary lending problems never have to worry about these problems. Liquidity drying up? Rates automatically increase. Now they don\u2019t have to worry about DC adjustments but having automatic rate adjustments is SEVERELY NEEDED. Where are we on implementing automatic rate adjustments and why is it taking so long? What is happening on the onboarding front? Cyrus and team are doing a great job but 1-3 new collateral a month is not fast enough. Are we discussing adding new risk teams? I\u2019ve seen a bunch of RWA forum posts crop up but what are the next actionable steps into onboarding these? It\u2019s great to talk about them but what are we waiting for? 4. Overall lack of iteration speed SNX has new iterations almost every month. Aave just announced v2 with an exhaustive list of protocol improvements. As I see it, Maker is slow to iterate. I\u2019ll give the Foundation credit that things are still moving forward (see Liquidation 1.1/1.2, Domain work, Governance stuff, etc.) but where are the big changes to stay ahead of the curve? I know Liquidations v2 is on its way as well as a new governance system but aside from that what is going on? Does Maker need to use its 100k warchest to hire more developers and build out more products, or is there a lot down the pipe but is not being communicated effectively? This brings me to my last point. 5. Lack of transparency/communication Maker has always had a communication problem. Weeks and Months would go by without word of what was going on behind the scenes and then communication would go out on a new feature and we were expected to vote on it the next week. Now I\u2019m not sure how much of this is based on wanting to keep cards tight to the chest for competitive advantage reasons but knowing and discussing upcoming changes months in advance is beneficial to MKR price and community perception. Most competing projects have a roadmap of some sort. Where is the actionable timeline that the community can follow and get invested in ahead of time? Without clear direction/communication on the future, community becomes disillusioned and apathetic. We want to speculate on the future. It is actually a good thing. Also, the whole \u201cFoundation in the high castle\u201d schtick does not promote passionate community participation. Projects where everyone feels like equals will succeed and the feeling I get from Maker is that the Foundation is in a secret ivory tower and expells information and updates whenever they see fit. More transparency and communication overall would go a long way to promote and facilitate more community involvement.  Conclusion The problems I have discussed are what I see as the largest threats to MakerDAO\u2019s success. I think the major theme underpinning them all is lack of community participation. We need to be doing a better job in bootstrapping this community and aligning the incentives of all participants. Relying on a few VC\u2019s and whales to run the voting (if they ever vote) is not sustainable or survivable for much longer. I don\u2019t want to hear hand waving excuses for these concerns. I want to hear what is actively being done to address these points. I hope to be proven wrong in my assumptions and put to rest that these problems are being dealt with. Now, these concerns could all be for nought. We could be in a DeFi bubble of unsustainable incentives that will all come crashing down. But do we want to be completely wrong and ignore every innovation coming out now and just stay the conservative course and die due to lack of innovation/\u201cstaying with the times\u201d? I think these are existential questions the community AND Foundation should discuss and decide, \u201cwhat is the best way going forward for MakerDAO to survive, and thrive?\u201d Thanks for listening to my TED talk.

I\u2019m not fully engaged in other DAOs, but I know a lot of the talk in the YFI group is token issuance and value capture, and YAM\u2019s 100K for audits came from four addresses.  We can\u2019t let the Foundation hold our hands forever.  We have to learn how to submit MIPs and be the change we\u2019d like to see.     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of community participation    I would say voting participation is very low, but forum participation is growing.  I view @LongForWisdom @hexonaut @monet-supply @MakerMan @befitsandpiper as very engaged members who are growing into leaders (sorry if I missed the other regulars!).  The voting system overhaul will absolutely help relieve some governance stress, and delegation may be how people first learn how to participate, especially if it has the right incentives.  Also, we have SourceCred, which could use some more attention     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of efficient monetary policy    Agreed.  Let\u2019s get MIP17 passed, stop manually changing parameters, and use math Collateral on-boarding could use more community participation.  We have community members learning how to audit and having regular calls     Aaron_Bartsch:   Overall lack of iteration speed    MCD is not even a year old, and there are eight new collateral types, we have like 600% more DAI, tons of new oracles, a framework for full decentralization, we survived Black Thursday (which impacted Maker more than other protocols), plus a new liquidation system, voting system, and possibly real world collateral only a few months away (did Aave say when they were launching mortgages?  Probably Soon\u2122)     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of transparency/communication    I view MIP1c2: The Initial Problem Space as the road map.  I can\u2019t speak for the Foundation, but I bet they have reasons for operating how they do.  Would more transparency be nice, absolutely.  But it\u2019s not like we are completely in the dark, maybe just on the day to day operations.  I\u2019m sure if we ask nicely they will share their google calendars with us      Aaron_Bartsch:  Conclusion   You know how when you learn how to ride a bike, and your parent is holding onto your seat so you won\u2019t fall.  Eventually they have to let go, and then you\u2019re on your own.  The Foundation has to let go for this to succeed.  Maybe they already have, and we haven\u2019t fallen yet.  It\u2019ll be okay, we will learn. Thanks for listening to my TikTok   ",

                    "content": "As a preambule, I would say that the MKR price doesn\u2019t really matter at that point. Markets are far from efficient in DeFi at this stage. What matter is maturity, velocity, growth, product market fit and market share. Maker is a startup in an immature market. 600M of market cap is already nice. Maker is first on TVL, that\u2019s awesome. Maker is maybe losing market share vs other stablecoins, that\u2019s not super great but it remains the first decentralized stablecoin. And I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the power to mint DAI and DAI network effects. Overall, if I summarize your problem (let me know if I\u2019m wrong), it\u2019s that MakerDAO is not autonomous yet. You are always relying on the foundation (for implementation, leadership, direction and funding). I found awesome that the foundation made it clear again and again that the community autonomy is the goal. Obviously without power, MakerDAO is not really in charge. And power, in the business world, come from having resources which MakerDAO does not have. I don\u2019t know how much expenses were made last year to improve and sustain Maker Protocol, but I\u2019m sure MKR holders (except the foundation) have paid none. MakerDAO governance can signal pretty much what it want, then the foundation (or any big player) decides on what is the priority for them. Luckily, they are kind enough to see an overlap. @rich.brown made a nice comment  on Signaling Request: Should Maker make a Treasury to manage revenue? calling it having \u201can outsized impact on what the future of the protocol looks like\u201d. 8 months later I\u2019m not sure the community seized power on it\u2019s own destiny. Regarding some responses and some side discussions I had on my proposal [Poll] Creation of a MakerDAO strategic reserves (solving the peg) (which is almost the same, I just came later) I can tell that it will not be an easy task (but one within reach). Maybe Maker should stay a purely programmatic smart-contract without the pain of having an organization behind it. But then, let\u2019s stop talking about a DAO. I can be wrong, but you don\u2019t manage a 1B market cap organization without any expenses and no balance sheet. There are a lot of problems we can discuss, but defining the organizational and financial structure of MakerDAO is the only one that matter for the long run and it would solve most of your issues.

Those platforms don\u2019t have to worry about a peg therefore they probably have more bandwidth to focus on new features/developments. Having said that, they also encounter more competition hence probably all the development to attract market share, they also have to pay fees to be able to lend and are airdroping equity for users, it\u2019s pending to see what actual usage they will have when that runs out. Maker on the other side does not pay for usage and as of now has the highest TVL, Dai has been 4x since 2019 and new collaterals have been onboarded but the big problem is that all this is at the risk of mkr hodlers with no revenue, that\u2019s why I sum it at that point. That\u2019s honestly my biggest concern, we need revenue to scale development, we need revenue to cancel black friday, we need revenue to mitigate risks, we need revenue to expand marketing & integrations, we need revenue to encourage participation, we need revenue to attract the best resources and then let the community decide if it\u2019s worth choosing a collateral or not. Currently all this is foundation. I would also like to know what the foundation is working on, I believe if the market knew it would help, I\u2019m sure that this point has also been discussed internally and they may well have their reasons which I don\u2019t know but in principle a more proactive approach on comunicating developments/pipeline would be a good sign, this also applies to mkr whales/venture capital firms. At first when I invested I though it was great to have VC onboard, at least I though ok, this guys know what they are doing and will help in different aspects but participation on their end has been at most low, all you see in the forum are community people + some foundation employees and how precisely is community going to scale precisely? It does not generate much confidence from someone outside who thinks of getting in. All the RWA aka holy grial, how is this going to be implemented with the current staff + community? Community should be a vote of confidence about how you want maker to be but you need actual top tier people who know what they are doing to implement it, and that costs $$$$ ergo, we need revenue.

From  marketing DAI via unknown NFT Apps like Marble Cards to running pilots with the likes of  Centrifuge and introducing  DAI via Coinbase to the masses, they have pushed it along. The Foundation has quietly helped the DAO\u2013without asking for gratitude and Fame. Let\u2019s not forget the Amazing Teams that the Foundation has put together\u2013from the Risk, Dev, Marketing, and Community Teams\u2013All of these folks I am thankful for. And the cool thing is, they span from Patagonia to Macao! How world-renowned is that? So, when I hear other Apps are doing great and their TVL is up the wazoo\u2013I think about the Protocol below that has made it ALL happen. I think about the TEAM Members that have made it ALL happen. You know who they are. Give credit where credit is due. And the RUSH to get to Revenues\u2013without scaling & product-market fit\u2013Revenues won\u2019t matter. Just ask startup founders who put the cart before the horse.

It\u2019s also our job as community members to see where improvements can be made aside from praising how far we\u2019ve come. I think there is definitely nuance in my insights that are not fully communicated but that does not mean that they don\u2019t exist. A lot of your remarks touch upon the exact problems I bring up, lack of communication/transparency. It\u2019s the communities turn to take the reigns (as they want). We need to know the regulatory waters we\u2019re wading. Just because we\u2019re individuals serving an autonomous organization doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have liability. We need to \u2026 As I\u2019m writing this I had an epiphany of sorts that these things are all coming, I\u2019m just putting the cart before the horse. The fact that a call went out to respond to media is testing grounds for community takeover of marketing/media relations. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and the Foundation is still in the process of handing over the reigns. I, as an antsy individual, inuit these problems and demand answers as I see them. I just want to know that what I\u2019m thinking is right and in progress. This is where the roadmap/communication/vision would go a long way to building faith within  the community (myself in particular). What are the steps to decentralizing? Are there certain milestones or are they winging it? Once it seems right they roll out the next feature when we can handle it? In all, I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the technical side (as that\u2019s not my expertise). It\u2019s the psychological side that concerns me (concerns 1, 2, and 5). If I\u2019m deep in this thing and feeling these ways what are others looking in from the outside thinking about Maker? Knowledge can be gleamed from most criticism and I think it\u2019s important to listen and learn from that. Circling back to some of your other points, revenues don\u2019t concern me the least. I will concede that DAI supply has been on a tear lately and the peg is heading in the right direction. Protocol upgrades are coming down the pipe with governance and liquidation improvements and new collaterals are being on-boarded every month. My biggest concerns are: community member acquisition, incentive structuring, and future communication/transparency. The Foundation has had an air of secrecy going back to the purple pill days and that has always left a bad taste. If the Foundation wants us to trust them then they need to trust us. I hope this doesn\u2019t come off too harsh, I wouldn\u2019t be here or so passionate if I didn\u2019t think this was one of the (if not the) best projects out there. ",

                    "content": "Totally agree but this is the issue with information asymmetry. At least speaking for myself I feel like it\u2019s hard to evaluate as a community member next steps when most of the development is being done \u201cin the dark\u201d and I don\u2019t mean this in the bad sense. The Foundation is 99% responsible of every development and the fact that maker is were it is now is thanks to a dedicated team of people who put maker there starting with rune who came up with this brilliant idea. Having said that, how can I prioritize when I have no clue what our finances are? What is the pipeline? What are our resources & how are they being applied? Therefore the only way I can \u201cplan\u201d is to be upmost conservative and assume we start from cero and for that we need muscle and for muscle we need resources, I can\u2019t presume a hand over because I don\u2019t know when, what & how that\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know how much operational budget is burned per year and those are costs we are going to assume, I presume at some point foundation members are going to be paid through mkr revenue and that\u2019s great but this are important matters that have to be planned with sufficient time and not from one day to the next. You state about start ups without revenue and it\u2019s true but that\u2019s why there is the fools money, the angel money and ipo money, you can roll out your product on a loss if you have someone backing you, maker has already issued their tokens, unless off course we could issue more equity for development (which serves me just fine) At the end of the day and this is my personal opinion as a mkr hodler, we will need resources one way or another and this is my half blind opinion because I have no clue how many resources does the foundation have and what is their budget as well as till when.

                    "content": "    Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of Foundation leadership    I think others have nailed this point. But to lay it out more concretely: the Foundation will be dissolving at some point. If the Foundation were to take a clear leadership role, it would prevent the community from doing so. By not taking this role, the Foundation leaves it open to the community. As others have pointed out, it\u2019s up to us to seize control of Maker\u2019s destiny.     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of community participation    This is definitely an on-going concern, and I\u2019m open to an ideas you have to fire people up further and get people excited. I will say though that it\u2019s not really fair to compare the participation within some of the newer protocols with the participation in Maker. Lots of others have the \u2018new shiny\u2019 aspect going for them. Will Kyber see 876 people voting on the 300th vote? It\u2019s too early to tell. On the subject of VC\u2019s, I agree that having more participation would be fantastic. That said, I\u2019ve spoken to a number of them at this point, and at least one has regulatory concerns that prevent them from sharing opinions publicly. In many ways this is not ideal, but in some ways it is an advantage: There is little danger of large MKR Holders dominating discussion or the community. We have a chance to build a community where an individuals value is based solely on merit as opposed to capital.     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of efficient monetary policy    Completely agree with automated adjustments to parameters within a certain range. To be honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure why we don\u2019t have this yet either. On the collateral onboarding front, I actually disagree pretty heavily that 2-3 collateral types a month is not fast enough (at least at this stage.) There are very few collateral types that actually have the potential to back a large amount of DAI. We\u2019ve seen this in practice with some of the lower-cap coins currently onboarded. It seems much more important that we focus our efforts more on worthwhile collateral. With regards to increase the number of domain teams and getting RWA onboarded, I agree, these are high priorities. I know you aren\u2019t looking for hand-waving, but this comes down to the community finding / referring individuals who have interest in doing these sorts of jobs. Even passing something like a MIP13 calling for additional domain teams would be a positive step, because the intention is then backed by a MKR vote.     Aaron_Bartsch:   Overall lack of iteration speed    I agree with this to some extent. I do wish that we could see more ambitious improvements take place sooner (who doesn\u2019t!) That said, there is a lot of capital locked in the Maker Protocol at this point, rushing changes to smart contracts seems like a bad idea. Just because other projects have gotten away with rapid development and skipping audits in the past doesn\u2019t make that a good idea. If you keep rolling the dice at some point you\u2019re going to roll a 1.     Aaron_Bartsch:   Lack of transparency/communication    Agree 100%. I hate it and I spend a lot of my time arguing and pushing for more transparency. There are regulatory issues that affect this, apparently. ",
