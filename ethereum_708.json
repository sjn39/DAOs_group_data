If we want to keep this as an active ring, we should probably focus on one aspect of the system so it can be a valuable use of time and we can create useful documents. The dgov foundation has regular meetings now, and many of the governance-like topics may be best for those meetings. They also have a wiki: https://wiki.dgov.foundation/ As a DAO ring, we can help contribute to dgov\u2019s wiki for our focus area. Action Item What are your thoughts on the topics that are best suited for Magicians (look at the notes for examples, or suggest your own)? ",

Some may not get enough attention, but it focuses the conversation. @tjayrush did this for the Data Ring discussions from EthDenver and it was helpful. I like the idea of coordinating with DGOV on this, perhaps work out a protocol for where things are discussed, how the repos are used, and where the final content goes (e.g. the DGOV wiki). ",
