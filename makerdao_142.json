For example, I am working for the Risk CU, I am getting 10,000 Dai a month, and I have to pay my bills by the first of November. It looks slow to be streaming 10,000 Dai. Second, is the wrapping part centralized? Are you running a centralized server to do this? How do I unwrap it? Do I have to go to my favorite app UniSwap or do I have to stay in this environment? 31:00 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Could you Ricochet Dai to you? Can you change DAIX for DAI, and stop needing to unwrap to DAI? 32:09 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How about the gas that needs to be used to wrap or unwrap? Is it something relatively lightweight? 33:10 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: In which chains or sidechains are you on? 35:00 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How about the tokens that you can stream? Is it any ERC? Can you wrap it and send it, or do you need to whitelist them? 35:53 - Deniz DUX: If I look at the payment flows as a team, we are going to have the benefits that we mentioned only if all the nodes in our payment process start using it. We have transactions between the team Vault and the team members and from the team Vault to other payment providers. How can we coordinate this within the DAO to try and maximize the benefits? Are there any learnings or considerations with regards to taxes that you can share with us, specifically on streaming salaries? 43:36 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the programmable part of the money, one of the things that we are exploring and researching is how to make governance control cash flows directly. Ideally, there is this fluid plutocracy where MKR holders can move their vote around and directly impact or influence the flow. That would help us and help any DAO on dealing with budgets and how to move funds around. Is this is something that you are looking into? If yes. How is it going? Do you have any comments on that? 46:25 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: The idea is to have a river or the opposite of a river. You have a bucket or a general budget at the top, and you can create streams going down. The streams can be modified based on the percentage or absolute numbers. The delegates or MKR holders would be able to divert the funds based on whatever they think is best at the moment. It is still exploratory and early in the process. We are figuring things out. 49:34 - Nadia Alvarez: Just a comment for Deniz. The way CUs receive the budget could be by a stream by the DssVest contract. I am receiving this stream on the mainnet from the DAO. Also, I am paying through Superfluid to a few of the contractors. The system works monthly, making it much easier. I do not have to think that I have to pay these people because they are receiving the streams. From my user perspective, I love it. It is another paradigm when you are receiving your payments daily. 55:43 - Frank Cruz: Would somebody from a CU that is not technical be able to put together the constant flow agreement on your documents? Is it easier on your dashboard? 56:32 - Frank Cruz: If I have five employees and I need to distribute 40% to this one, 30% to the other one, etc., how easy is it to do? 58:56 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: What is it the best way to contact you for any questions or concerns? 1:00:02 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Are you going to be in Lisbon for all these events that are coming soon? 1:00:35 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Anything before leaving? Any last word?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 01:01:05  Thank you for coming. It was really great having you. See you soon!   Credits   @gala produced this summary.
