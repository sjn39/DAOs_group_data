                    "content": "MIP3: Governance Cycle Preamble MIP#: 3 Title: Governance Cycle Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23) and Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Type: Process Status: <Assigned by MIP Editor> Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a  Summary This proposal formally introduces a Governance Cycle. The Governance Cycle provides a predictable framework for Maker Governance decisions. Furthermore, it provides participants (MKR holders) with a monthly overview of the decisions that are to be made, allowing participation despite time constraints. Motivation The goal of the standardized monthly governance cycle is to provide advance notification and high predictability of governance activities in order to enable MKR holders to stay informed on relevant topics and participate in voting despite being time-constrained. The structure of the governance cycle enables active governance participants to join the discussion at the proposal submission level from the beginning of the month, while less active governance participants can simply review the end results at the end of the month and decide whether or not to vote for the final executive vote. Specification / Proposal Details MIP3 Components   MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Breakdown  MIP3c2: Default Inclusion Threshold Modification Subproposals   MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Breakdown Each monthly governance cycle begins on the first Monday of the month, with Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) submitted by community members (defined within the MIP0 Framework). These proposals will be considered for inclusion at the end of the month\u2019s Executive vote. The governance cycle ends with an Executive vote that begins on the 4th Monday of the month. Proposals submitted must follow the guidelines defined in MIP0. Week-by-week breakdown of the Monthly Governance Cycle Time is inclusive and in based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian calendar Week 1   1st Monday-Wednesday of the month:  The Formal submission (Phase 5 described in MIP0c2) of proposals that are to be included in the new governance cycle. The formal submission is done on the formal submission category on the MIPs Discourse forum (as defined in Phase 5 in MIP0c2)    1st Thursday of the month:   Inclusion Poll Review (Governance Meeting): Discussion surrounding which proposals are in accordance with guidelines (defined in the MIP0 Framework), which proposals are inadequate (even if technically following the guidelines)    Week 2   2nd Monday of the month:  The Governance facilitators publish an inclusion poll. The proposals that the specific Governance Facilitators\u2019 have general consensus on are included, but each Governance Facilitator, in their own can add their own individual short description and list order (which is critical for voter heuristic behaviour and important power of a governance facilitator in times of dispute or uncertainty). The Default Inclusion Threshold is a variable amount that can be changed by MIP3c3 sub proposals. The default inclusion threshold value is automatically counted towards the no vote tally of each item in the inclusion poll. The default inclusion threshold is changed with MIP3c2 subproposals.  An MKR voter has 2 options for each proposal in an inclusion poll:  Yes or no. Where the no votes simply increase the barrier of the proposal to pass.    Outcomes: If the Yes votes for a given option in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of No votes and the default inclusion threshold, the proposal will be included in the governance poll.  If votes: yes > (no + default inclusion threshold) = inclusion in governance poll.      2nd Thursday of the month:   The Governance Poll Review (Governance Meeting): occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion.    Week 3   3rd Monday-Wednesday of the month:  The Governance poll submitted by the Governance Facilitator. The Governance poll will run from Monday until Wednesday. The Governance Poll is a yes/no MKR poll that accepts or rejects the combination of all MIPs that passed the inclusion poll stage, including any executive vote code from Technical MIP components or sub proposals.    3rd Thursday of the month:   Executive Vote Review (Governance Meeting) - this public meeting will focus on either future proposals or controversy around the current governance poll and the future upcoming executive vote. In case there are too many no votes in the governance poll, and there is evidence that there is an effort to silence legitimate concerns in the community this meeting provides opportunities for compromise and the community and governance facilitators must consider whether it is creating a risk of governance split. If a governance facilitator believes that the proposed executive vote will result in a governance split, the Governance Facilitator should not deploy the executive vote and must instead work with the community to resolve the problem. Thus, if all governance facilitators are in consensus that the executive vote creates a significant risk of a community split, the executive vote will not happen and the MIPs that were supposed to be up for an executive vote, instead have their status changed to deferred.    Week 4   4th Monday of the month:  The Executive vote is submitted if the governance poll has passed and the no votes are not too high to deem it a threat to consensus. Regular Executive votes must have an expiration of 7 days, meaning they blank themselves after 7 days. MIPs and Sub Proposals only get the accepted status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 7-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 7-day limit, the MIPs and Sub Proposals have their status changed to rejected.    4th Thursday of the month:  The Retro & Planning Meeting occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion. Discussion around the governance poll outcomes (for proposed collateral types) and proposals for next month, or retrospective on current governance cycle controversy. MIP3 sub proposals focus on modifying the default inclusion threshold for the inclusion polls. They are submitted to the governance cycle like any other proposal and their modified default inclusion threshold takes effect from the governance cycle following the successful passing of their governance cycle\u2019s executive vote.

Or by the governance facilitator? In the diagram it states GF, but the component text does not specify. Personally I would like to hear more about the rationale for having multiple parties \u201capprove\u201d MIPs as they come through. First (correct me if I am wrong) the MIP Editor approves a MIP by merging the authors Pull Request. The editor is looking strictly for adherence to the standards defined in MIP0? I dont necessarily agree with that set up, since I dont think we need to be so restrictive, but it makes sense if the main goal is highly ordered proposals. Second, either the GF(s) or some consensus in a Thursday meeting determines what is adequate. Why is this necessary and whats the rationale for the departure from \u201cgovernance happens on the forums\u201d? Historically we don\u2019t make any decisions in the governance call. In general this seems to be moving in a direction of giving the GF more power. I am curious about the reasoning behind that. Rich has stated many times that he does think his role (as it currently stands to be fair) should be making decisions. ",

Here\u2019s what I came up with: Week 1  Summary of the Accepted MIPs that passed last month. Any MIP or SP that has been Formally Submitted takes one of two paths:  Path 1: For MIPs/SP that do not contain on-chain technical changes to the Maker Protocol. Create a single yes/no poll for each MIP and SP that lasts for one month. In order to be considered \u2018Accepted\u2019 when this poll ends, the \u2018yes\u2019 votes must outnumber the \u2018no\u2019 votes by an amount of MKR defined as one third of the total MKR locked in DSChief at the time the poll ends. For votes to be counted in these polls, the voting MKR must be locked in DSChief at the time the poll ends (not in the hot/cold wallets.) Path 2: For MIPs/SP that do contain on-chain technical changes to the Maker Protocol. Create a single yes/no poll for each MIP and SP that lasts for three weeks. In order to qualify for inclusion when this poll ends, the \u2018yes\u2019 votes must outnumber the \u2018no\u2019 votes by an amount of MKR defined as one third of the total MKR locked in DSChief at the time the poll ends. For votes to be counted in these polls, the voting MKR must be locked in DSChief a the time the poll ends (not in the hot/cold wallets.) Week 2  Reminders about the above polls. Other business.  Week 3  Reminders about the above polls. Other business.  Week 4  Reminders about the above polls. Summary of the items included in the new executive. Other business.  Path 2: For MIPs/SP that do contain on-chain technical changes to the Maker Protocol. Create an executive vote with an expiration of one week that includes all the \u2018executive-code\u2019 requiring changes that passed the inclusion poll as defined for path 2 above. ",

The \u201cthreshold\u201d works simply. \u201cDefault\u201d implies that whatever number is set gets counted as \u201cNO\u201d votes. Therefore, to be included, an MIP has to garner \u201cYES\u201d votes > \"\u201cNo\u201d + \u201cDIT\u201d. It is not used to trigger system decisions - just to provide some cursory protection at this early stage in the process.

                    "content": "I\u2019ve unfortunately not had as much time to engage with the MIPs launch process as I had hoped, but it seems to me like MIP3 is the proposal that is getting the most attention - which I think is great, as it is one of the MIPs that will have the greatest impact on governance going forward. First I just want to repeat what has been said many times before, that what\u2019s being proposed here for a Governance Cycle is only meant as a starting point, which will then be iterated on over many times in the future as practical observations on how the process plays out in practice helps inform the community about what best helps move us towards the ideal of scientific governance. But to better help the community improve upon the original proposal, it is of course important that the logic behind the original design is properly explained (what goals it is trying to achieve, and how those are achieved), as replies on this forum post have already pointed out. I\u2019ll also compare the design with what\u2019s proposed by LFW since that is a good way to highlight the pros and cons of the different design tradeoffs. Goals of the MIP3 design  Create a governance decision process that is highly parallelizable, allowing many proposals to be submitted, considered and ratified simultaneously, allowing it to scale up to the need for many new proposals and adjustments that the maker protocol will have in the long term. Ensure that even with a high level of parallization and scalable throughput, that the process is still highly secure and minimizes the chance of proposals \u201csneaking through\u201d (passing without much scrutiny) or getting \u201csteamrolled\u201d (passing despite significant opposition because not enough MKR voting power can be rallied in time) Ensure that every type of governance participant can meaningfully contribute to the process in the way they prefer, regardless of how much MKR they have or how deeply they want to be involved Create a predictable schedule that makes it easy to know when a participant should pay attention depending on how they want to contribute Ensure that almost all discussion and decision making happens before a proposal actually enters the governance cycle, encouraging consensus decision making and reaching compromises early, rather than having political clashes late in the process. It should be possible to discover potential contention early in the cycle, so that there are no surprises and standoffs at the very end of the cycle leaving the community little time to rally MKR holders for the executive vote. MKR holders that don\u2019t have much time to participate in governance, but that want to participate in the executive vote should be able to easily glean whether an executive vote is controversial and needs careful analysis on whether to take a stance and vote it through or block it, or if there is rough consensus and it can be voted through without much analysis  The design attempts to achieve these goals by making each monthly governance cycle a funnel process that begins broadly in the first week and ends in a single final vote. The predictable structure of each week in the cycle achieves objective 4. During the formal submission phase of the first week, any number of proposals can be formally submitted for consideration by the community and governance facilitators (maximizing throughput, objective 1). The community and governance facilitators then reach rough consensus on what proposals it is reasonable to include given the current environment, including whether they still have many loose ends, and whether there are bandwidth, and thus prioritization issues, that needs to be considered. This helps with objective 2, and also objective 3 since any person who is following governance actively can have a meaningful impact on how proposals get prioritized and ensuring all formal requirements and standards are fulfilled, even if they have little or no MKR. It also helps with objective 5 by ensuring the discussion of the proposal has already reached a logical conclusion by filtering against proposals that still have a lot of loose ends. The second week is the inclusion poll. By letting MKR holders pick and choose which proposals get included in the bundled vote, this achieves objective 1, and by letting even small mkr holders have a big impact on e.g. blocking bad proposals it achieves objective 2 and 3. By making it clear already at the end of week 2 which proposals are definitively going to be included in the final executive vote, objective 6 is achieved which means that in the case of controversial options being included the different factions will have another 2 weeks to rally votes for their position. The third week mainly helps with objective 6 and objective 7, but allowing smaller and more deeply involved MKR holders to signal opposition or support to the bundle, that way giving an advance signal to the participants in the last week. This additional checkpoint also helps with objective 2 by making it easier to stop bad proposals that have accidentally been bundled in. The fourth week is the final executive vote, and achieves objective 7 and objective 4 by making it easy for anyone to predict exactly when the crucial bundled executive vote happens, while at the same time giving them easily understood signals about the level of analysis they need to do before they can safely vote it through, block it or decide to abstain. To also further understand the pros and cons of this model, I will compare it to the suggested model by LongForWisdom, as this is very helpful in understanding the tradeoffs that were picked for the MIP3 design. The biggest advantage that LFWs model has, is that it is simpler and have less subprocesses and moving parts, which is a big advantage because it means there is less risk of unexpected dynamics in the process that were not known in advance. But where the MIP3 model has advantages is especially when it comes to objective 2 (security), 6(discovering contention early) and 7 (making it easy to participate in the executive vote), this is because when you have a month long inclusion poll, the best strategy for someone who is trying to push through a malicious proposal is to first cast no votes for their controversial proposal so other governance participants dont see whats coming, and then only vote at the very last day before the votes are bundled into the executive. This way objective 6 isn\u2019t achieved and it is very hard for governance participants to know if a given monthly cycle is going to contain a controversial standoff or not, because its impossible to predict whether the controversial proposals will be included or not. This then also means that objective 7 isn\u2019t achieved, because executive vote voters will not be able to know whether the voting distribution in the inclusion poll reflects a broad participation, or whether it reflects a significant surge in voting for only one side of the argument at the very last stage. It will thus be more difficult to participate in the executive vote and the executive vote will be the stage where the real decision making happens in many cases. This all in all then potentially hinders objective 2, because it results in less voter participation and less readiness to defend against malicious proposals that are being pushed through. ",

I\u2019m not sure you addressed what I feel is the core issue of the proposed MIP3 though, namely that it requires bundling process changes into executive votes. You don\u2019t need to do this, and I\u2019m not sure what you gain by doing so. I do understand slightly better now why this is laid out as it is, and I\u2019m not blind to the value of the objectives you\u2019ve laid out. But I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re seeing how much of a barrier this process will place in front of people that are not obligated to do literally anything. The free-rider problem is real, if you set up a process in which any change requires three votes passing over the course of a month very few people are going to participate in it. Every month we\u2019re going to be answering the same questions: Annoyed Participant: Why is this in the executive? Us: Because the earlier polls in the governance cycle fell out that way. If you want to change the contents you need to participate in the other polls. Annoyed Participant: When are the other polls? Us: 2nd Monday of the month, for three(?) days. 3rd Monday of the for three days. Annoyed Participant: Okay, maybe I\u2019ll try to remember to be around for those. But I can\u2019t vote for this one. Repeat next cycle. People aren\u2019t going to vote for an executive if they object to something in the executive. All that will happen with this process is that all the signal will only arrive during the executive, and because everything is bundled, all the negative signal for everything in the executive compounds and the executive doesn\u2019t pass. You can argue that this shouldn\u2019t happen for as long as you want to, but it\u2019s ultimately pointless because empirically this is already happening on a weekly basis. We already have executives that include items that should definitely pass, and are rejected due to other items in the executive. This situation will become 4x worse when we are bundling a months worth of changes. The Chief needs to change such that you can vote for and pass multiple issues at once, separately. Once you\u2019ve made that change, everything becomes far more efficient. If you make the correct change, this actually increases security over the current system. ",

With monthly votes that contain more substantial changes, and a clear signal on whether those changes are contentious or have high level of consensus, the executive votes will see more participation, and will pass easily in the situation where there is a strong signal of consensus. This is exactly why you need to bundle changes together - by going in the opposite direction and unbundling decisions the issue of constant executive vote spam gets worse, resulting in greater governance gridlock.

You are conflating two issues. It\u2019s possible to have a large set of votes happen once a month, this is the best way forward imo. You have a fixed schedule and expectations, but you avoid bundling. The main reason that is not currently possible is because spreading MKR over the executives in the Chief lowers security. So that is where the Chief changes come in. MKR should be able to vote on every spell simultaneously and the value to exceed is 50% of the MKR locked in the Chief. ",

So, the critical question, in my mind, is this: What would it take, technically, to implement LFW\u2019s suggested changes in Chief?   If the answer is: \u201cA whole heck of a lot that would delay any kind of MIP-based governance process by many months with development and auditing,\u201d then I think we must compromise in favour of Rune and look to simplify things as time moves along and we get some experience of the so-called empirical conversation LFW outlines.   If the answer is, \u201cMeh, not so much. Canz change in the next 2 months,\u201d then I think that LFW\u2019s points are very well made. I like the distinction/clarification/efficiency in splitting on-chain changes from gov process ones, and I like that there is more time to handle general governance things, which are always like a house on fire anyway.

                    "content": "Looking above I see some questions on this MIP actually never made its way here. I was wondering on rocket chat why both an inclusion poll and governance poll are necessary. Scottrepreneur and Charles responded, with Charles expanding on Scotts point, this may be helpful for others so I included his comment:  As stated in the MIP3\u2019s Motivation, a primary goal of the standardized monthly governance cycle is to provide advance notification and high predictability of governance activities in order to enable MKR holders to stay informed on relevant topics and participate in voting at any point during the cycle, despite being time-constrained. This means that governance participants can join the discussion at the proposal submission level from the beginning of the month, while less active governance participants can simply review the end results at the end of the month and decide whether or not to vote for the final executive vote. So, depending on what level of participation they want, governance participants can join in and voice their opinion throughout the entirety of the governance cycle and still have an impact.   Inclusion Poll: * When governance users decide what they want to bundle together into the governance poll. As Scott mentioned, it also serves as the threshold to necessitate the attention of a gov poll. An important aspect of the inclusion poll is that it allows MKR holders to have a big impact early on.   Governance Poll: * Reviews the inclusion poll results, allows participants to voice their opinions if they did not get the chance to do it during the inclusion poll.   Executive Vote: * At this point, the community has a good idea of what the results will be and this serves as the final stamp of approval.    My main issue is how this ignores historical precedent with how MKR holders react and respond to high volumes of votes. It sounds nice to say this process would allow everyone to participate as much as they want, but no evidence shows why things would work out this way.  LFW nails it in the dialogue above, explaining how MKR holders generally react to bundled executives. I believe Kurt mentioned this as well, but any votes relating to a social process rather than a technical change doesn\u2019t need to be in an executive (do mkr holders really need to vote on the social processes at all anyways?). The inclusion poll basically replaces the signaling process which determines what goes to a Governance Poll. This trades the ONE democratic(ish) governance process for another MKR vote. The RFC period only allows for a MIP author to accept someones feedback. With that in mind I have trouble seeing how this process allows more input from non-MKR holder vs how things work now. ",
