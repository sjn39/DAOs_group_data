Just maybe a simple email list maintained by the team that one could sign up for, for an alert when a proposal actually makes it to a point of being ready to be voted on.  There is so much discussion, ideas and such on this forum, and that is great, but very little makes it any further than that. People come, people go, opinions change, so I don\u2019t want to delegate my votes to anyone.  I\u2019m way too small time to have the votes, or to get them, to start a proposal, and it just seems like a lot of energy to spend trying to do so at this point anyway, with little to be gained.  If the big fish do manage to put up a vote, I\u2019d like to know about it though, so I can vote in the short time frame. Thanks for considering - again, a very simple MailChimp or similar list would be fine, preferably maintained by the Team itself, rather than a 3rd party, informing us that something was on the ballot.
