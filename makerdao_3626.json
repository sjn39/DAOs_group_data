This post will attempt to gather community feedback through a brief set of polls as I attempt to figure out the best path forward. While MKR Voters\u2019 feedback is extremely valuable here if the proposal wasn\u2019t exciting enough for you to vote your opinion is also important! Huge thanks to @hexonaut for drafting these questions and encouraging this post. MIP49 has occupied my headspace for the better part of 4 months now, and while I\u2019m a bit burnt out on the subject, the danger of too much MKR out on lending markets remains a pressing concern that will need to be addressed by the community.    What are your Feelings on MIP49: Staking Rewards  I like the MIP as written I like the idea, but the specifics need changing I don\u2019t like the idea because I don\u2019t think it will work I don\u2019t like the idea because I don\u2019t want additional tax liability I don\u2019t like the idea for another reason (please elaborate in the thread) Abstain     0 voters        Payout Denomination  DAI MKR Abstain     0 voters     The next topic is Token Lockup. Many platforms offer rewards to token users willing to lock up their holdings for extended durations. Some, like Aave, offer more of a \u201ccooldown period\u201d where tokens must remain for 10 days once staked.    What lockup period is appropriate for Staking Rewards?  No lockup Short lockup (~10 days) Medium lockup (~3 months) Long lockup (~1 year or longer) Abstain     0 voters     This final question concerns the allocation amount to staking rewards. A reminder that staking rewards will be based on funds otherwise heading to the burner. This means that the system is only paying out when flap auctions would otherwise be occurring.    How should staking rewards be allocated (all number refer to burner flow percentage)?  Fixed amount: 5% Fixed amount: 10% Fixed amount: 25% Fixed amount: 50% Fixed amount: 100% Variable, based on Governance Actions Variable, based on outside lending rates Variable, based on the amount of DAI otherwise heading for flap auctions Abstain     0 voters     Thank you for taking the time to vote! If there is enough sentiment I will proceed by making a FAQ for Staking Rewards and making edits to the MIP based on this feedback, and that of the large voters, should they make their feelings known.

So by giving rewards we can only bring people in Chief at the margin, based on how much they care about Maker, how risk-taking they are, etc.   I don\u2019t think this is true at all. Based on the numbers I crunched we can not only compete directly with Yearn farming we can probably draw in those who are more risk-adverse and prefer an alternative.     swakya:  A fully automated system (even with lockups and whatnot) is vulnerable to a middleware contract attack. Governance would always have to play a cat-and-mouse game if people tried to get the rewards and still lend based on the value of their MKR holdings. The better the rate we offer, the more incentive there is to game the system.   This is technically true, but unrealistic from a practical standpoint. Currently only a few lending markets have enough liquidity, security, reputation to borrow any serious amount of stablecoins. This is a cat and mouse game, but one we can easily win in an adversarial situation by implementing a blacklist of wrapper tokens. Lending markets need to do a large amount of work to onboard a new collateral (SC work, oracle work, voting, etc). This is in addition to the work the token creator must do to promote their token as the \u201cgo-to\u201d rewards wrapper token. All we have to do is blacklist any token which can be tacked onto any governance vote or even possibly operated by a multi-sig. This is a very credible threat, so the chances seem almost zero for this type of scenario happening. Furthermore Aave is currently engaged with us on MIP50 (which passed), why would they start adopting an adversarial position?     swakya:  The whole securities thing.   I\u2019m not a lawyer, but it seems to be altering the profit-taking mechanism should have no effect on this? Admittedly this could be a concern. I wish we could move away from USA-specific legal stuff, but unfortunately that\u2019s the world we live in I guess. ",

Based on the numbers  I crunched we can not only compete directly with Yearn farming we can probably draw in those who are more risk-adverse and prefer an alternative.   I think we\u2019re mostly in agreement. Unlike you I\u2019m not sure we can fully compete on the yields but there are indeed risk adjustments to make that could bring in part of the Aave MKR or enough outside MKR to compensate.     hexonaut:  This is technically true, but unrealistic from a practical standpoint.   Yes I\u2019m overall buying that, at least medium-term. However I\u2019ll note that as long as we\u2019re up for manually fiddling with the reward rules, we may want to go all the way and manually vote every 6 months for a lock&activity reward in minted MKR.     hexonaut:  I\u2019m not a lawyer, but it seems to be altering the profit-taking mechanism should have no effect on this? Admittedly this could be a concern. I wish we could move away from USA-specific legal stuff, but unfortunately that\u2019s the world we live in I guess.   Yup I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be out of those particular woods for another few years. ",

Yeah, to be honest I am also a bit disappointed and surprised. I was kind of sure this would have passed easily. Well, I was wrong! I like the attitude of this comment:     Planet_X:  I liked MIP49 but it probably would have made a failed Howey-test more likely with resulting trouble with the US SEC. So it is back to the drawing board. The task is to get MKR into the voting contract without directly paying to do so.   We should take the result of this onchain poll constructively and improve on the original MIP49 proposal. Thanks a lot @hexonaut and @prose11 for your work.     prose11:  while I\u2019m a bit burnt out on the subject   I think the right approach in these cases is to accept the result, take a break of a couple of weeks (from this topic, if not from work in general), and come back with renewed energy!

Hope we can all agree on those goals and appreciate the work that @prose11 +co have done to push us to make progress. However, we\u2019re not sure that staking rewards are a sound near-term solution:  Staking rewards do not directly incentivize meaningful governance participation, like voting (let alone thoughtful voting).

We\u2019ve been flying blind for most of the previous MIPs, so this kind of feedback is critical to match future proposals with what MKR holders want.     cnoyes:  Staking rewards do not directly incentivize meaningful governance participation, like voting (let alone thoughtful voting).   Agree with this. The intention of rewards was never to encourage voting. I\u2019m skeptical that proper voting incentives can ever be encoded on-chain as any strategy is likely to just be gamed.     cnoyes:  Staking rewards may not pull that much MKR off lending markets. Holders can still tokenize and lend locked MKR. Even with a lockup, provided the rewards yield isn\u2019t insanely high, the only effect may be to raise the borrowing costs a little bit \u2013 inconsequential for an actual threat actor.   Respectfully, I disagree with this point.   As I outline here, I believe we can directly compete with the yields being offered at Yearn. That combined with the staking rewards having much less risk than farming should help to pull a good chunk of the \u201clazy farmers\u201d.   The tokenize and lend strategy can be easily distrupted by a blacklist maintained by a multisig with governance override. Making a token, building liquidity and getting it added to a platform like Aave is not trivial and likely takes at least a few weeks of hard work. This is compared to the 1 tx that the multisig can perform to stop this. If we present the credible threat of a blacklist to anyone attempting to do this it should be enough to stop this from happening.       cnoyes:  We agree with @g_dip and @equivrel that delegation is a more credible near-term solution to low voter participation. Staking rewards would also influence the incentives to delegate, so we\u2019d prefer to revisit them after (or as a component of) implementing delegation.   So I agree with the point about delegating likely solving this for now especially since you guys have stepped up to the plate to help with governance. One thing I will note about the delegation is that we are building the contracts to give the rewards to the delegator and the delegate as I agree the incentives would be rediculous giving a delegate that high of a return. Happy to hear you are open to revisiting this later. I really hope this loaning MKR problem goes away, but I suspect it will not. ",

There was misinformation on Reddit and other forums about the intent of the MIP to hijack/incentive voting. To my knowledge\u2026this was not the intent of the Staking Rewards proposal. My suggestion: take the feedback, add more explicit controls over staking rewards/mechanisms, clearly emphasize the need x10 of the importance to protect against governance attacks\u2026eventually the competitive moat we have created with the DAO/MKR as a governance token without a yield/staking component has the potential to really hurt the small-time investor to take interest in the protocol. The jury is still out whether plutocratic DAOs can build sustainably for the top holders and continue to foster inclusion for the small fish. For a small fish like myself: staking rewards with the intent to protect the protocol feels a lot better than sitting on a small amount of MKR and not being able to vote/find sustainable yield because of enormous gas fees and not your keys/not your coin risks (eventually will be eliminated with L2s, etc.) Keep it all in-house? A different risk profile for me. Thank you to all those that worked on this first rendition.

Let us hold position in the approval voting system and lend out the non-voting gov IOUs if we want to trade off lockup for more returns. (Is it still using DSChief under the hood?). This staking model is appealing to high time preference voters and it seems like it would naturally tend towards increasing staking rewards until they are 100% and then such voters would naturally choose to start diluting non-staking holders for even further rewards.

It did seem like part of the purpose was to lock in MKR stakers for when there is a black swan, but this is basically the opposite of what you want (this kind of crisis is exactly when you want the people who want to sell to get out and people who want to buy to get in \u2013 a reallocation towards better risk managers). OP identifies that the only justifiable argument for the lockup here has to do with borrow/vote attacks, which I address in the last post. If you want to compensate people for locked up risk-sharing, that could be achieved with something like a user-funded surplus buffer, IE, lock up their cash (dai) and redirect revenue to giving them a ROI like an insurance policy.

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  What would this look like in practice?   The top-voted address would be a contract which encodes the logic of how decisions are delegated. At the moment there is a de-facto executive team that puts together proposals and pushes them through the voting process with very high probability that voters just go with the proposal. The problem is that there is attrition of MKR voters precisely because they are OK with this setup. I guess it is trending towards having multiple teams with distinct responsibilities. Each could be represented as, for a example, a time-delayed multisig. MKR voters only have to coordinate when there is something that they need to respond to. (Personally I think collateral approvals should move towards a process where proposers have some kind of skin in the game, e.g. futarchy-like betting+voting on which collateral types are safe.) Note that you could still have MKR voters themselves be a form of delegated voter, so simple majority voting for polls or day-to-day actions could still be a thing. As time goes on this could become more sophisticated because you can choose arbitrary logic. Each change in ruleset requires beating the MKR approval quorum. The key point to reiterate is that in an approval voting system, each outcome is essentially a separate election \u2013 votes for different options do not add up to 100%. So you can have a situation like this: Option 1: 80% approval  (the current ruleset) Option 2: 65% approval  (the current ruleset with a minor change) Option 3: 40% approval  (a totally different ruleset) By analogy, in the US we have nearly 50/50 division between the two major parties, but there is overwhelming approval of the constitution itself. The constitution is not really up for vote each election, though it can be changed with enough consensus and coordination. ",

                    "content": "Are you @cnoyes saying that Paradigm thinks the governance risk posed by lended MKR is better solved by increasing voting participation?  This makes sense to me.  The pool of sleeping/idle MKR is significantly larger than the pool of lended MKR, is it not?   Better to focus on diluting the potential power of a negative actor by turning idle/absent holders into participants. As a MKR holder who fits the @hexonaut Sleeper profile (3+ years; zero participation; no intent to sell; small fish), I can credit my (lack of) participation to high gas fees.  I\u2019ve pulled up multiple straw votes with the intent to vote, then gaffed at the high gas fees (@Mr.dorf).   I\u2019d be very interested to hear from other sleeper accounts; why are they not participating?  Hard to design solutions without knowing the motivation(s) of these idle accounts.  Maybe MKR holders are simply accustomed to free-riding (habits from holding stock?) and don\u2019t fully understand/realize the risks to their MKR holding that governance attacks pose? Thank you @prose11 for facilitating this effort.   My primary concern with offering staking/rewards without first understanding why people are not participating (I\u2019m again assuming a large part of our MKR pie is idle, and like me), is I worry we might inadvertently foster incentives that promote short-term decision-making.  For example, I would much rather see excess fees used to burn MKR rather than used as income (@PaperImperium).  I see income as a short-term reward (you get something today), and burning a long-term reward (scarcity will increase demand later). ",
