Similarly, we could assert that any chain that could be attacked by someone spinning up enough AWS/Azure/GCE nodes (i.e., there exists enough access to global hashing power) to attack it is similarly insecure. If that is your definition of security, then I will agree to your assertion that a chain split results in one of the two chains being insecure.  However, I strongly argue that this isn\u2019t how chain security is (should) be measured.  What matters is whether or not there exists enough financial incentive to attack the chain such that one can profitably do so. In the example of diverting hashing power to attack some chain, unless you have an attack that will allow you to double spend more than it costs you to divert your hashing power then I argue that the chain is secure.  The recent double spend attacks against blockchains have occurred because exchange platforms have allowed users to transact for larger values than the system can properly secure against.  This is a mistake by exchanges, they should never be transacting off-chain for more than the security of the system (which to be fair, is hard to measure). ",

                    "content": "I wouldn\u2019t immediately use the word \u201cinsecure\u201d, but those conditions are necessary ones for insecurity.  It\u2019s not such a black & white issue though. If there\u2019s profitability in addition to this, then I would definitely deem the chain insecure.  However, there\u2019s more factors than just financial incentive that go into determining whether or not somebody will take advantage of a hashpower weakness. Just the posibility of an attack, even if motives aren\u2019t 100% clear in a financial sense, can be more than enough to sway miners to jump ship and go to the more secure chain - further exacerbating the hash power issue. Relating it back to the topic, I feel like default settings / auto update take power away from those who wish to actually participate in voting with their hashpower.  I also believe that the default decision of miners should be \u201cchange nothing\u201d, so that abstainers from decision making processes are not unknowingly supporting change. Outside of governance issues, auto updates sound like a good idea. Especially if it\u2019s a 1-time opt-in setting. ",

The move to PoS will hopefully solve the problem by making it so that the \u201cdo-nothingers\u201d traditionally in control of the network are out of the equation, leaving only active participants at the helm.  At that point, abstaining from governance should be considered an active decision against change, not a default that leads to stagnation. ",
