The poll will let the community decide on the limit for the Starknet DAI bridge. Risk review and mitigation  The risks related to the simple bridge have been summarized in a joint post between Bartek (PECU) and Maciek (Starknet Engineering CU): Starknet DAI bridge and Starknet platform technical risk assessment  Each risk has been assessed by severity and frequency. Mitigative actions and processed have been implemented for each risk vector. A spreadsheet summarizes the risk vectors and the mitigations.  Risk parameter proposal  The simple bridge to have a bridge limit of DAI 5Mn. The scope of the simple bridge is slow withdrawal, fast withdrawals are out of scope for this release. The bridge limit is the maximum amount of DAI that can be in the L1 bridge contract. Hence it is the maximum amount that can be lost by users The bridge launch will require the completion of all the mandatory items on the checklist  Users will use the simple bridge at their own risks. It will be mentioned on the bridge interface  ",

I believe the upcoming SR should include that question  as part of the Mainnet-Starknet bridge 5 million DAI POLL  Signal Request(if the community wants it to go to an Executive). Personally, I will Poll YES. Because allowing the Mainnet-Starknet bridge to increase above & beyond the Surplus Buffer (currently 67M) should be a gradual event voted upon by MKR token owners & Delegates. As we have seen, bridges like the Solana Wormhole can be exploited. I believe once the Mainnet-Starknet bridge and StarkNet platform have been battle tested, the community will feel a lot more comfortable scaling beyond the SB. After all, we are talking about swapping and minting over $1B of synthetic DAI into CanonicalDAI. Fingers crossed. ",

The bridge limit for other rollups does not exist, we are having a bridge limit in this context because Starknet is still a new technology and it has not been audited fully or gone through formal verification (it is planned though). The amount of the DAI bridge limit is in line with the limit Starkware will self-impose on other ERC20 bridges. @LongForWisdom , to reword what @flipflopflapdelegate  just said. We discussed in mandated actors meetings and internal L2 meetings that an on-chain poll would suffice to launch the bridge with a low limit. However, the future decision to increase or waive the bridge limit will be subject to an executive vote. Any request to increase that limit should be backed by proofs that we have increasing confidence in Starknet and the bridge implementation. ",

So in general we don\u2019t do this anymore unless there is some parameter or technical change that we need to make in order to action the results of a vote. From the sounds of it, it doesn\u2019t seem like we need an executive in order to implement any aspect of the bridge at this stage, so until that changes I think we\u2019ll stick to on-chain polls to determine any changes to the bridge limit. How is the bridge controlled at this point? Like is admin access controlled via multisig, and/or is admin access being transferred to Maker Governance like we did with the Optimism bridge? EDIT: From the risk assessment it seems like this is the plan, it would be good to be able to give an indication of the timeline in the poll. ",

Based on what\u2019s been said so far, I\u2019m guessing the following is what we\u2019re doing:  We poll on initial parameters for the StarkNet bridge. External dependencies are met (Starkware launching the bridge interface). SECU deploy and setup bridge with initial parameters. SECU transfer ownership of the bridge to governance (after some lindy period?) Future changes to the bridge will now require an executive vote in addition to an on-chain poll, because SECU no longer have admin access to make changes without Maker Governance.  Is that correct?
