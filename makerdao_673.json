Protocol owned MKR/DAI LP is good but needs a mostly automated approach, and to be built gradually. There should be an ongoing source of funds for it, and policy of what to do with it. I suggest directing excess protocol funds to (percentages configurable by governance): 25% Surplus Buffer 25% Flap (buy MKR and burn) 25% Buy MKR (like flap but don\u2019t burn) and pair with Dai in MKR/ DAI LP 25% Dai paired with MKR in MKR/DAI LP Additionaly, adopt a flop abatement scheme. In the event of flops exceeding a defined rate, additional flops (up to a defined rate) are averted by liquiding MKR/DAI LP funds. The result is a growing MKR/DAI LP which shares backstop duties with MKR inflation.     Yes, it would nice to have something like this if it were pratical. No, wouldn\u2019t want to deploy this even if it were ready to be deployed Something else (please expain) Abstain     0 voters     To put this into the context of the parallel signal to manually fund a $20m LP, at the current surplus growth rate of around 3.10 DAI/second, it will take around 149 days to reach $20m funding, then will continue to grow.  Meanwhile, slower growth of the surplus buffer is balanced by using the growing MKR/DAI LP as co-backstop with MKR inflation. ",
