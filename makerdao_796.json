Motivation The CES Core Unit was ratified in September of 2021. Given its sole focus on collateral onboarding and maintenance, Domain Team status is recommended to officially participate in the defined MIP processes for collateral management. While Domain Teams predate Core Units, they are still actively used in many of the collateral MIPs. For completeness and accuracy, it is recommended to onboard the entire CES team following the MIP7 onboarding process.  Work Credentials The Domain Team members are currently part of the CES Core Unit. While this list will change with the addition or departure of CES contributors, additional MIP7c3s will not be proposed as the entire CES Core Unit is being onboarded. Only in the case of offboarding the entire CES Core Unit will MIP7c4 be used.
