So that question remains correctly answered imo. Perhaps a better thing to do is better explain the term Flash Crash, since it can be confused with a general market-wide crash of an asset like what happened during Black Thursday. Will think about how to reword, we have a maintenance cycle coming up at the end of June to look all of the FAQs over. If you have the time, you\u2019re more than welcome to submit a PR with your own version of the answer. Github Vault FAQ edit page Nevertheless, thank you for this feedback Kames! ",

I could do a Twitter poll if we wanted to collect some data?  If you have the time, you\u2019re more than welcome to submit a PR with your own version of the answer.  Have some free time on my hands. Happy to submit a PR if there is a reasonable likelihood of getting merged (obviously within reason/quality) and would be reviewed. ",

We should just focus on explaining what are the assumptions that keepers can liquidate:  enough keepers willing and being able to bid keepers biding have enough dai liquidity etc.  Why keepers could not be willing to bid:  potential complete loss of confidence in collateral (crypto) collateral type \u201cfloor\u201d prices don\u2019t really exist, there is no widely shared consensus about metrics (at least  at this point in time) for long term value. waiting on/expecting further vicious cycle of liquidations (preserving capital) based on known distribution of vault collateralization ratios etc.  ",
