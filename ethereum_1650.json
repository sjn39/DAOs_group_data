This change would enable automaticlaly all the capabilities of composable tokens ERC-998 (own other ERC721 or ERC20) natively without adding any extra code, just forbidding to mint more than one token per deployed contract. Then the NFT minted with this contract could operate with his \u201cbudget\u201d (the ERC20 he owned) and also trade with the other NFTs he could own. Just like an autonomous agent, that could decide what to do with his properties (sell his NFTs, buy other NFTs, etc). Well not really autonomous, because it still requires external inputs to operate, but kind of\u2026 For sure additional code and functions should be added to the implementation to allow all these operations. I am thinking on submitting a new EIP for this \u201cNFTs with wallet\u201d (not sure how to name it yet), but first wanted to know other opinions on this idea (as suggested in the EIP guidelines). Does this make sense for you? ",

It sounds like you want to basically make a smart contract wallet that you can transfer using ERC-721 functions? That seems interesting, but the EIP as written is nowhere near specified enough to function as a smart contract wallet. There\u2019s so much more that has to go into it. If you want to explore this route more, I\u2019d recommend checking out the contracts powering existing smart contract wallets! ",

(are there other smart contract wallets?) 173 is good for smart contract wallets, but the main point for my proposal is to be also an ERC-721 compatible contract. ",
