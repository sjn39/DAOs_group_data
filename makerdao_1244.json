No. However, we have realized significant benefits since the introduction of the delegation system. The presence of identifiable actors who wield voting power is IMO a net gain to the protocol. There is a reason that other protocols are modelling their delegation systems on the MakerDAO delegation system (see Interest Protocol whitepaper for an example). Because Recognized Delegates are incentivized to provide the rationale for their voting decisions, we get actionable feedback on failed proposals. Before the delegates, the author of a failed proposal would have no way of knowing why their proposal had failed or how to amend it to make it viable at the on-chain stage. This benefit applies equally to community members and CUs - see discussions around CU budgets. Similarly, the ability to pass Executive Votes promptly is not to be under-estimated in terms of the security gains and ability to execute changes to the Maker Protocol at the technical layer. Before delegates, the community often had to resort to appealing on Twitter or other social media for votes to push Executives over the line. Regarding specialized delegates - all delegates are welcome to specialize if they choose. A delegate can create a platform that states they will only vote in RWF-related votes and executives and otherwise abstain. This would be perfectly valid; if MKR holders wanted this kind of delegate, they would be able to delegate to them. For compensation, \u201cabstain\u201d is a valid vote. ",

In practice, I suspect it would be very difficult to do this from a technical perspective - requiring rewriting the delegate contract and possibly the voting contract.

This would require an overhaul of the compensation structure (which is something we\u2019re interested in looking at) if we wanted delegates to formalise these relationships but this could also be done unofficially under the status quo system.

PE is focussing on L2, teleport, compound D3M and other high-value projects. DUX is concentrating on gasless voting and a polling metadata overhaul, which will allow for much more granular voting options. So, any changes we make in the short term must work within the confines of the current system.     ACREinvest:  I think you are missing the thrust of what @Eumenes is getting at and what a number of Delegates have been highlighting as an issue, including myself. The problem is not strictly speaking lack of knowledge and being penalized. It\u2019s about capacity and commensurate incentives sufficient to compensate for risk and opportunity cost.   I don\u2019t think I have missed the thrust at all. I may disagree or agree with various points being raised, but the issue isn\u2019t whether or not I agree but how we proceed as a DAO. What I am asking for is actionable feedback or suggestions on how things should be changed to fix the perceived problems. To take the example of specialized delegates, it\u2019s easy to say \u201cwe need specialized delegates\u201d but that lacks any detail that would be required to even consider an implementation plan. For example:  Who assesses whether someone is suitable to be considered specialized? How does the delegation process change to accommodate specialized delegates? Does an MKR holder pick from a selection of specialists in different areas? Can a delegate opt to exist outside the specialized delegate framework? How do we pay them? Can specialized delegates vote on issues outside their stated area of expertise?  If the idea is a board of directors model:  How are they nominated? How are they selected/elected? How are they removed? How long do they serve before needing re-election? Term limits? What explicit powers do they have?      ACREinvest:  Given MakerDAO\u2019s product and service offerings, utilization of domain expertise in governance is a must which we can do while also maintaining an open, flexible realm of participation for a wide spectrum of backgrounds and intentions.   I generally agree with this. In my opinion, the best way to attract expertise is with an incentive structure. Regarding incentives, for what it\u2019s worth, I am generally in favour of increased incentives and have been suggesting this internally. However, I still believe that any incentive structure should, at a minimum:  Scale with the amount of MKR delegated. Be weighted towards smaller delegates to encourage new delegates to come forward - although we could adjust the current weighting. Have some form of limit - although I think we could raise this significantly from the current one. Provide controls against abuse/sybil issues - participation and comms metrics do this at present.  I would be open to hearing any suggested changes to the compensation structure from you or any of the other @Recognized-Delegates. This could be a good topic for an issue discussion call so it can be discussed in real-time (@Davidutro @thomas.flitter). ",

And by scaling I\u2019m referring to building a team that consist of hires that become knowledgeable of the Maker ecosystem and it\u2019s products. These individuals are hired with a skill set related to necessary subject matters related to the Maker realm and help each delegate platform make an executive decision and participate in all voter committees, office hours, MIP6/67 presentations, Core Unit initiatives, etc. Similar to what these teams that are delegates (Gauntlet, GFX, etc.) are doing/juggling  for many platforms + ecosystems, except that these funded delegate platforms that I imagine are focusing on all things MakerDAO as an internal Team.

There\u2019s certainly a lot to be said for that and fits more with the idea of executive delegates that have been mentioned at times. Obviously, this adds considerable expense but could end up being worth it. I\u2019m less sure about making it dependent on being exclusive to Maker - but that is a more minor detail. ",

Last time I thought about this (1 2), the conclusion that seemed sound is that additional compensation should not depend on the amount of MKR delegated. If it does then this actually hinders MKR owners from expressing their views. That is, it should be possible to delegate 10k MKR to team A and 20k MKR to team B and give equal funding to both teams. Hence, I would suggest that Recognized Delegates develop a MIP40-like DAI budget that can be approved by MKR holders. This budget would be in addition to the usual MIP61 compensation and be scaled by the MIP61 Performance Modifier. The budget should justify why the work funded is not a DAO-wide common good that should be conducted by a core unit (such as Data Insights). That\u2019s my proposal. ",

I\u2019m not sure this is a necessary outcome we need to design for, given the confounding variables of other delegators etc. But, if we wanted this system we could remove the quadratic from the delegate compensation formula which would also simplify things to a degree rather than adding extra complexity. It\u2019s fairly important that delegate rewards scale with delegated MKR as the net security benefit they provide the protocol also scales with this metric. I don\u2019t like the idea of breaking this - one could argue the current system is also breaking this for those above 10,000 MKR, which is why I think we should start to look at moving out of the bootstrapping phase. Some follow-up questions about this to consider:  How much do you think is a reasonable number? Are all delegates entitled to the same flat amount if they meet the metric requirements?  If No - why not build it into other compensation structures instead of making a new one? If Yes - this produces a vector for exploitation.   Who should control the budget stream? (The answer is not GovAlpha).  To add, there is nothing stopping a delegate from proposing a budget to fund operational expenses as things stand if they wish. They are welcome to make that proposal and see how it goes if they think it would be beneficial. ",

This mitigates the concern that delegates don\u2019t have enough time or that they cannot be an expert in every area.  If delegate compensation were to increase, I would anticipate more of these groups popping up to outcompete one-person delegates in knowledge and prolific production of ideas and thought.  Clearly delegate compensation is already enough to incentivize some of these groups.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to explicitly promote this type of delegate though.  MKR holders may value certain people who provide special insight but would not be willing to work on a team and split compensation.  It\u2019s all a competition and the cream should rise to the top.  What you need right now is probably more visibility and interest.  That doesn\u2019t necessarily only come from increased compensation. Anyhow, in our current environment, I would be very wary of any kind of increase in spending that isn\u2019t strictly necessary. ",
