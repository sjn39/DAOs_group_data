Acquisition is expensive, churn is fairly high, and marginal revenue will trend toward zero. It\u2019s time to look beyond the end of our noses and start positioning for the next source of demand for on-chain credit.  1064\u00d7692 1.21 MB   Increasing the Demand for Organic DAI Successful organizations align around a single, core mission. In my opinion, generating organic demand for DAI is MakerDAO\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre, it\u2019s North Star. Organic demand is different than circulation, which is good but not enough. To onboard RWAs is to increase the circulation of, but not necessarily the organic demand for, DAI. (In a second-order kind of way, RWAs could increase organic demand, but let\u2019s stick with first-order for now). When a real world asset manager opens a vault, it will most probably swap the DAI for fiat to achieve something off-chain, like developing real estate or repaying an existing financing line. DAI is a means to an end. On the other hand, when a crypto user opens a DAI vault, he or she will probably use the DAI proceeds themselves to achieve something on-chain, like providing liquidity. DAI is a destination. The reason we want to maximize organic DAI is that it is stickier. In the traditional world, a retail bank\u2019s deposits are sticky (low redemption rate) and thus a stable source of funding for such institutions. Similarly, all DAI outstanding is a liability of the protocol\u2014MakerDAO must always honor redemptions on demand, lest the market lose confidence in it. Accordingly, how MakerDAO might deploy capital productively is dictated by the nature of those liabilities. If redemptions are consistently rare (sticky DAI), then MakerDAO can take more and longer-dated risks on business initiatives (D3Ms, RWAs, etc.) that drive revenue to the protocol. This increased revenue will bolster the market\u2019s perception of DAI, which drives more organic DAI demand, which opens up more diverse opportunities for revenue, and so on and so forth. Money is a network, and as such, we must focus on laying the rails for a network effect to take hold. Though many jeer at the unsustainable rewards Anchor currently bestows upon its disciples, both UST and DAI will live or die for the same reason: use cases or lack thereof.      Is DAI the Destination?     Crypto-Loans Yes   PSM Yes   D3M Sort Of   RWAs Not yet     Aggressive Growth - Framing the Fund Raise The core of MakerDAO is its direct crypto-loans business. This kernel should remain rigid, maximally decentralized, and permissionless. This business spits off revenue and will grow passively in lock-step with crypto\u2019s market cap. Hopefully we will gain additional market share via L2s as those deployments roll out. The PSM, Maker\u2019s second layer, should take on a bit more flexibility but also remain fairly rigid. The core mechanism shouldn\u2019t change too much but its constituents may change as DAI strategically allies with other stables. The D3M and RWA layer is where Maker\u2019s latent potential lies\u2014through deployment here, a larger surplus buffer will usher in a new era of Aggressive and profitable growth. A matter of survival, experimentation will occur in the RWA and D3M petri dishes.  1310\u00d7655 57.7 KB  RWAs, as currently contemplated, are a huge opportunity for DAI circulation and revenue but not yet for organic DAI demand. Because the real world is mired in economic, technical, and legal path dependencies, DAI will not for a few years organically penetrate the existing capital markets. For it to do so would require \u201cusers\u201d to change their behavior, which is not reasonable. As it should be, the community is committed to the pursuit of off-chain RWAs. We, RWF, will forge excellent partnerships with excellent managers. Not only will these vaults kick off a LOT of revenue, but the partnerships with established firms and companies will enhance and legitimize the Maker brand. As the RWA business matures, RWF will push to innovate on the RWA protocol. Through these efforts and the efforts of our peers, assets from the traditional world will soon live natively on-chain. But we can\u2019t wait for that day\u2014it is imperative to find PMF for organic DAI today. We need organic use cases that will shuttle DAI to Valhalla. Aggressive Growth will push ahead. In thinking about how MakerDAO should structure its imminent capital raise and in what quantum, we must consider the array of growth opportunities we, as a community, believe will deliver the specific properties most likely to drive success for MakerDAO. Only via measured consideration of the \u201cuses\u201d can we back into the capital markets \u201csources\u201d intelligently.  798\u00d7368 95.7 KB   Start With Start-Ups  1600\u00d71002 357 KB  Square\u2019s inception was based on the premise of this diagram: that small businesses paid ~45x more for payment solutions than did larger ones in 2009. By enabling the digitization of SMB payments, Square unlocked the latent potential of and piggy-backed on the successes of its customers. The Square product was fine but it was the fit between its unique product and the right market (product-market fit) that was excellent. DAI is our product. Success, in my view, lies in organic uses for DAI, so how do we create more of these opportunities? As Paul G suggests, you put the product (DAI) in the hands of start-ups. Why starting with start-ups is a Zero to One:   Tabula Rasa: Start-ups are inherently more likely to adopt and use DAI organically.  DAO Jones: Today\u2019s digital and crypto-native up-starts will be the household names of cyberspace in 2030. If this unicorn cohort is the DAO Jones, Maker should be JP Morganon.  Unique Positioning: Unlike with RWAs or crypto-loans, MakerDAO is uniquely positioned to infuse start-ups with DAI and unlock potential. No other lender has a native stablecoin. No other stablecoin issuer has a native lending business.   D3M - The Start-Up Spark Plug The D3M is currently the tool within Maker\u2019s toolkit most broadly equipped to tackle this vision. Though I believe its current shape will morph, the D3M serves as a canary for what is to come, a hybrid approach\u2014a crypto back-end, protocol-to-protocol, that enables commercial activity. The D3M is the pilot of MakerDAO as a wholesale lender\u2014it lends to crypto-centric lenders like Aave and crypto-real world lenders like Maple or TrueFi, who then face borrowers directly. The D3M is interesting because it gives businesses, rather than individuals, predictable access to credit. Ultimately, the distinction between \u201cRWAs\u201d and the \u201cD3M\u201d will disappear. This happens via two parallel channels:    Real world rails themselves migrate natively on-chain     Asset constructs familiar to traditional finance (equities, bonds, derivatives) are issued by entities that live natively on-chain    As of now, the perceived difference between how MakerDAO categorizes RWAs and D3Ms lies in how risk is classified and thus which core units have the burden of assessment. The D3M, allegedly, incurs smart contract risk but not credit risk. RWAs, allegedly, incur credit risk but not really smart contract risk. Neither characterization is really correct. As we are realizing with the potential onboarding of Maple and TrueFi, not only does smart contract risk exist but also credit risk. With RWA integrations like Centrifuge, Maker incurs not only credit risk at the asset/borrower level but smart contract risk at the platform level. For the next cohort of MakerDAO assets, this bifurcation will be irrelevant. These assets may look and smell like traditional risk assets (equities, bonds, derivatives, real estate), but live completely on-chain. Rather than build on legal contracts, the next slew of start-ups will embed such assets into smart contracts.  1016\u00d71232 66 KB  I think MakerDAO will and should take an increasingly barbelled approach to DAI generation. On one hand, it will lend to fintechs and DAOs in primarily a wholesale capacity. This will be done via a D3M-like wholesale lending mechanism but with thorough credit underwriting of the specialist lenders as well as their clientele (engineering + real world finance). We will call this B2B DAI. On the other side, MakerDAO will lend large amounts to retail and institutions directly against crypto and crypto-related assets in an accessible way for borrowers. We will call this EZ DAI.  Model 1: B2B DAI Acquiring and retaining consumers is hard in any space, never mind in crypto lending. Crypto borrowers have grown accustomed to rewards for adoption, which can result in expensive and dilutive emissions. We know that such incentivisation is not sustainable, but this is the state of things today nonetheless. The open-source nature of the ecosystem makes for even more treacherous conditions: vampire attacks, an endless slew of borrowing options, and a broad-brushed erosion of brand loyalty have become the norm. B2C lending is hard and only getting harder.  718\u00d7650 71.1 KB  *Source: Recurly Research By lending to businesses creating economic value, a lender\u2019s financing is stickier, with lower acquisition and end-client management costs, and it can grow into the borrower\u2019s commercial success. While the commercial lending market in TradFi is saturated, the on-chain commercial lending market is greenfield. MakerDAO should spearhead and unlock these credit markets, a blue ocean. By sizing credit risk appropriately, we\u2019d start with a portfolio of small exposures and grow into these businesses. As the successful ones season and de-risk, MakerDAO would scale up the credit facilities, lighten the covenants and pricing, and enable these companies to grow unhindered into their potential.  1474\u00d7628 87.4 KB  Takeaway: There exists no institutional commercial lender for on-chain commerce. Capital markets for DAOs, or more broadly DAO-to-DAO finance, are still underdeveloped. In the coming months we will witness the genesis of the on-chain corporate bond market through platforms like Porter finance. Unlike their real world counterparts, many DAOs will opt to pay operating costs (indexing, payroll etc.) in DAI. More speculatively, I predict we will also see demand for native integrations of stablecoins into crypto gaming worlds: successful \u201cmetaverse\u201d concepts (e.g. Crabada, Star Atlas, Illuvium) serve as the gateway for normies to enter our rarefied world. They will have vibrant capital, rental, commercial, and labor markets. Because [game] economies are so notoriously difficult to bootstrap and balance, a permissionless stablecoin integration may be an elegant solution. MakerDAO will, through rigorous credit underwriting of on-chain businesses and smart-contract guaranteed security interests in those businesses\u2019 native assets, simultaneously mobilize dead capital, supercharge on-chain commerce, and generate strong risk-adjusted returns for MakerDAO\u2019s treasury. MakerDAO is uniquely equipped to serve this role as THE on-chain wholesale lender.  Model 2: EZ DAI (DAI For Normies) Crypto vaults, where DAI is minted against Lindy assets like wBTC and ETH, are obviously ideal because the risk of loss is low (and monitorable) as long as the smart contracts are tight and the oracles are right. In their current formulation, crypto-vaults are great for the crypto-savvy but inaccessible to normies, whether individuals or institutions. Those uncomfortable with self-custody, changing borrowing rates, or just on-chain maneuvering cannot and will not use Maker\u2014this leaves a ton of potential DAI demand untapped. To mobilize some portion of the crypto paralyzed in custodial wallets would be to expand the TAM for DAI drastically. A note on definitions: I will be using the term \u201cAccess Vaults\u201d to describe what the MakerDAO community has historically called \u201cInstitutional Vaults\u201d (e.g. Nexo, Celsius). These are aggregators who custody retail funds and wish to gain direct access to DAI liquidity. I will use the term \u201cCorporate Vaults\u201d to refer to vaults extended specifically to companies/institutions who do not necessarily face retail users. Access Vaults: The Nexos and the Celsiuses of the world, start-ups with a crypto back end and normie front end, are multiplying and taking on new forms. Contemporarily, most retail facing start-ups who deal in crypto are, in one form or another, exchanges. But this will change rapidly. As crypto continues to normalize and presumably become less volatile, we will see convenient avenues arise that allow people to monetize their crypto holdings as they would their S&P equities or homes. MakerDAO should tactically partner with start-ups who stand to benefit from this trend. To visualize, think about the invariable rise of the crypto-mortgage, or a loan secured by both crypto AND property. Start-ups like Figure and Moon Mortgage recognize that A) a straight mortgage is becoming unaffordable and B) that more and more potential borrowers hold crypto. So they combine the mortgagor\u2019s (yes, the borrower is a mortgagor) crypto collateral with property collateral and offer better terms than competitors who are unable or unwilling to underwrite crypto. Like Nexo and Celsius, these sorts of companies will eventually have custody of hundreds of millions in retail crypto that they\u2019ll want to access leverage and reinvest back into their businesses. MakerDAO must continually evolve and re-evaluate where the puck is going. To provide capital to exchanges is a crowded trade. Further, exchanges are a natural target for regulatory scrutiny\u2014they\u2019ll be sensitive to KYC/AML issues. How can we re-envision what form an \u201cAccess Vault\u201d takes to ensure that DAI sails elegantly on the gales of creative destruction? Corporate Vaults: It may be too early for Bitcoin bonds, but crypto-secured term loans to corporate clients are on the menu. Silvergate Bank recently originated a $205MM bitcoin-backed loan to Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy. ETH and BTC will increasingly be used as treasury assets by sovereign wealth funds, central banks, and corporations. Accordingly, such entities will want to borrow at attractive rates against such holdings. As mentioned in the epilogue of \u201cRWAs - The Case For Continuity\u201d, a rising rate environment generates opportunity for cheap, predictable, fixed rate lenders. The cost of capital for corporates (and governments!) is rising and will probably continue to rise. At what point does it become a fiduciary imperative for a CFO to borrow more cheaply against crypto than he or she could in the corporate bond market? There is an opportunity here and savvy C-levels will seize it. MakerDAO is uniquely equipped to serve at this intersection\u2014that of crypto and traditional credit underwriting. We have teams in-house to build out both the technical implementation of crypto-only vaults and the credit framework to provide more creative financing to particular clients. (e.g.imagine a crypto and ASIC-collateralized vault to a institutional miner).  Payments - The Final Piece A discussion about organic DAI demand would be incomplete without consideration for the last mile\u2014payments. Without a gateway through which DAI natively flows into the real world, DAI fails to penetrate meatspace. We\u2019d like for DAI to be a medium of exchange, not just for NFTs and crypto-commerce but for day-to-day purchases. Such a goal is practically impossible to realize on mainnet but there are obvious partnerships to pursue with cautious optimism.  \u201cWho Controls Money Controls the World\u201d - Kissinger The North Star for the Aggressive Growth Strategy and MakerDAO more broadly is to supercharge organic DAI demand\u2014the journey towards DAI as money. If this is indeed the mission, then we should be orienting relentlessly towards the vehicles that will get us there. To me, RWAs in their current formulation are a stop-gap, a necessary shoehorning of DeFi into TradFi. But the next stage of Maker growth will be a unique form of financing that only MakerDAO can give life to. The D3M and RWAs will merge into a single deployment mechanism to infuse DAI into the ground-floor of a new, parallel, and uncorrelated economic engine. ",

I have noticed for this, often in LatAm, that they provide extra services including exchange capabilities in addition to payment rails / Visa cash back card. While there is greater convenience along the transaction supply chain for users in that region, by underwriting Dai to provide a positive return for holders (and the Access Vault), Maker can take some of the marketshare that these digital wallets earn from their customers with stable coins. An example of this would be Lemon Cash. They have seen hockey stick growth this past year. Perhaps we can propose a regional priority across classifications. As CPI and regulation are unique across the fintech stack, we should also prioritize adoption to understand the hiccups for growth at scale. I am of the personal opinion that the greater we continue to maintain our finger on the pulse here, we will become more competitive in this hyper competitive space down the road. The additionality when closely considered could have a snowballing effect. ",

These assets may look and smell like traditional risk assets (equities, bonds, derivatives, real estate), but live completely on-chain. Rather than build on legal contracts, the next slew of start-ups will embed such assets into smart contracts.   This is so true.  The early innovation happening in on-chain RW financing today is creating the building blocks that all financial innovation (and fintech more broadly) will be building on in the future.  Atm we have clear distinctions between \u2018on-chain\u2019 and \u2018off-chain\u2019 financing, but soon we\u2019ll have less need for those terms, as more RW financing just occurs on DeFi rails. This also highlights the importance of startups working together.  It\u2019s a positive sum game - the rising tide of RWAs on-chain lifts all boats. ",

I\u2019ve been quietly making the case here and there that we need to pay attention to the social token sector and rapid emergence of DAOs as an internet-native organizational model that not only points to Web3 being the future of the internet, but DAOs as the future of everything.     teej:  Capital markets for DAOs, or more broadly DAO-to-DAO finance, are still underdeveloped.     to put it mildly. I swim daily in this DAO2DAO space. Three DAOs I will highlight below illustrate the opportunity. dOrg ACREinvest works with a Web3 developer collective called dOrg as collaborators in ACRE DAOs, a Web3 impact investment community we co-founded and sponsor. We pay invoices from dOrg entirely in DAI. This is organic demand\u2026 both from my firm AND our collaborators who do not want to take price risk by accepting payment in ETH (for example). Time magazine thinks our approach is pretty interesting: No Bosses: What It's Like Working at a DAO | Time  Salaries are transparent When it comes to pay rates and finances, dOrg aims for \u201cradical transparency.\u201d All salaries and budgeting are publicly maintained on the blockchain; payout logs are visible to each member. And employees are paid according to their skillset no matter where they live in the world. Amesty, who moved to Madrid from Venezuela after joining the company, says that when he previously tried to work for Latin American agencies, \u201cthey usually strong-armed developers to work for lower wages, because they know that Venezuela is in a very hard situation. After I started to work with dOrg, feeling my nationality didn\u2019t matter\u2014it was my work and what I was delivering.\u201d In another interesting wrinkle, employees who work on specific projects can elect to either get paid in cash, or in tokens that represent an ownership stake in those projects. If they choose that latter option, they are sacrificing immediate spending money in favor of the idea that the valuation of the tokens will increase as their projects mature.

The standout where Maker is failing imo. \u201caccessible\u201d, and honestly \u201cdecentralized\u201d.

The only link that comes up in a search as a concise Maker Mission statement is a \u2018third party\u2019 link above which to my mind illustrates that MakerDAO and Maker in general has lost it\u2019s way and needs to either re-affirm or re-define the Maker mission statement. It is now what almost 6 years since the first whitepaper.   Ethereum, Maker, and the whole crypto ecosystem is a vastly different landscape since the first vision and mission statement was conceived.

Combining this with the erstwhile vision behind MakerDAO, leads to a powerful guiding star.     MakerMan:  \u201cThe vision behind MakerDAO is to create a decentralized, transparent and accessible platform to level the economic playing field for everybody around the world.\u201d   DAOs so far have been fortunate to arrive in a market flush with capital where selling tokens or founders crypto-holdings meant monetary constraints were practically non-existent. This is likely to change though. Would maker want to be the lender serving entities that by all means cannot get a line of credit in the \u201creal world\u201d? I think it should. We\u2019re currently witnessing the birth of a completely new model of organising enterprises that allows for unprecedented scaling. The amount of DAOs starting and growing is only going to rise in the next years. MakerDAO can offer something that no other crypto lender can. The amount of knowledge and experience, plus the quality of the network are second to none. I wholeheartedly agree with your vision and think the concept of driving organic demand for DAI should be our north star. It\u2019s not a hard sell, either. I will repeat it as often as possible to drive this point home. Maker has one product, and one product only: DAI. Whatever drives demand for that product is in the interest of Maker. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the minutiae of implementation at first but would want to make sure that this vision of organic DAI is shared and understood by everyone.

Legal risk is, in many ways, a subset of credit risk. i.e. if legal structure is weak, the odds of losing money are of course higher, hence credit risk.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any canon because this is virgin ground. To me, the D3M will be an effective wholesale lending solution insofar as the institution/protocol getting access to Maker credit has both A) underwriting that we can believe in or B) sufficiently large native protections/buffers that shield Maker token holders against credit loss. D3M wholesale lending, to me, is just providing competitively priced credit to specialist underwriters who are experts in their niches. ",

The last mile is certainly a necessary step for DAI to be vertically integrated. We\u2019ve seen Stripe integrate USDC via Polygon. No reason we can\u2019t do the same with a partner who shares more ideological similarity. i.e. USDC and Polygon are limited in their censorship-resistance. MakerDAO might partner with ImmutableX/Efinity for gaming applications or Starkware/zkSync and LemonCash/Venmo. I could ideological see blocs forming: centralized, cheap and with limited censorship-resistance vs. decentralized, a bit more expensive, and with strong anti-censorship guarantees. Actually now that Elon has the reins, someone should lobby him to integrate DAI via L2s on Twitter rather than USDC. USDC is fundamentally misaligned with his goal of credible neutrality, whether on speech or money.     Shravanrajas:  I have noticed for this, often in LatAm, that they provide extra services including exchange capabilities in addition to payment rails / Visa cash back card. While there is greater convenience along the transaction supply chain for users in that region, by underwriting Dai to provide a positive return for holders (and the Access Vault), Maker can take some of the marketshare that these digital wallets earn from their customers with stable coins.   Yes, yes, and yes. Also, approaching LatAm/EM wallets would fit nicely with MakerDAO\u2019s origins. Instead of focusing on the \u2018E\u2019, might we make a larger dent focusing on the \u2018S\u2019 of ESG? ",

I would define \u201clegal risk\u201d broadly to include:   Legal structure risk - How does the legal structure protect Maker\u2019s interests and how robust is the structure in downside scenarios/bankruptcy? Set and forget is not a good approach.   Commercial risk - Does the transaction address the material commercial issues? If not, what is missing? Are the terms reasonable, balanced and protective of Maker?   Contract risk - How well drafted are the contracts that underpin the transaction? What terms are missing? We are not yet at the stage where we can solely rely on a \u201csmart contract\u201d - it is still very much traditional contracting with a digital overlay. This is one of the areas I want to evolve and I think that Maker can influence.   Regulatory/Legal risk - This category is very broad and can include an assortment of risks and will depend on the jurisdiction.   From a legal perspective, the biggest threat to the successful deployment and repayment of DAI is poorly constructed contracts and legal structures. Having advised on commercial transactions in over 40 countries, I have seen lots of good, bad, creative and otherwise. But I fully acknowledge even gold plated contracts do not help if the underlying credit is bad. I think there is an opportunity to scale, attract strong users, and get repaid by implementing higher quality contracts and legal structures. I am not looking for perfection, but rather contractual terms and legal structures that have been demonstrated to work in achieving scale, attracting strong users, and getting repaid. There is regulatory/legal risk of course, but those tend to be outside of our control.     Khan:  I\u2019ll never make fun of bankers and accountants for being boring again\u2026   And lawyers?

As others mentioned, accessibility is core to Maker\u2019s original mission statement. While crypto-loans are our bedrock, it is not very accessible to the ordinary or new user, which directly opposes this mission and vision. A few factors go into this, mainly UX and the vault parameters themselves. We must continue to partner with entities like Celsius or DeFiSaver to provide easy-to-use interfaces for generating DAI through crypto-loans. However, the other factor that needs a solution is to have these Access Vaults act as a sort of \u201cStarter Vault,\u201d which is low-cost for both Maker and users. For example, vaults with dust lower than ETH-C or WBTC-C so that people are not constrained to needing at least $5k-$7.5k to use the Maker protocol, especially for the first time. It will require some work with our Risk and associated CUs, but it could be a worthwhile endeavor to lower entry barriers and ward off the initial sticker shock. If we make Maker quick and painless in the above way with \u201cStarter\u201d Access Vaults, then there\u2019s no doubt that DAI demand will stick as a true DeFi solution. ",

                    "content": "Amongst all of the praise, allow me to take a contrarian stance here and argue that your post makes some major mistakes about how Maker works. You posit that there are two forms of borrowing, one where the borrower sells the DAI and one where they hold onto the DAI and use it in some form (e.g. LPing). In reality, this \u201cborrow and hold\u201d use case is very rare and highly specific to crypto. In the real world, people take loans to buy stuff (leverage) so this is the most organic form of borrowing you can have. In other words, DAI borrowed in vaults is supposed to be sold. Instead of one, there are two types of DAI demand: The demand to borrow it, and the demand to hold it. Both are important and in practice you should expect no overlap between them. At a later point, you seem to confuse loans with deposits. DAI holders, not CDP owners, are the depositors in our system. This ties neatly into the point about the two sides of DAI demand, as DAI holders (depositors) are lending money to Maker in return for interest (the DSR, currently 0%), and Maker is re-lending it to CDP owners for interest (the SF, varying but positive.) The spread between the two rates is our profit. How are the two demand types currently balanced? It may not be obvious, but we have too much demand to hold DAI and not nearly enough demand to borrow and sell DAI. The result is DAI consistently trading above $1, which only gets arbitraged down to $1 by minting DAI from USDC at 0% SF and has led to >50% of all DAI in circulation being backed by USDC. Our North Star, if we have any, hence has to be to grow the two sides of our market (holding and borrowing DAI) equally. In the medium term, the focus should be on improving our offering for borrowers, not DAI holders. If we succeed in that, it will also help to reduce the existential tail risk from USDC backing most of DAI. ",

I will point out that the USDC PSM is rapidly trending downward so it\u2019s not clear where we are with DAI demand at the current moment.  What I think is interesting about all this DAI demand talk is that it\u2019s really easy to create DAI demand.  With a flip of the switch, you can increase the DSR and increase demand.  So I do agree with @hasu that we need to focus on our lending operations.  We need revenue with good margins that can be turned into a higher rate.  As macro environment changes, we need different borrowers to choose from.  Banks get to lend deposits to each other at the fed funds rate without really losing much liquidity.  So they can easily find loan demand to make money on any reserve surplus they have.  MKR doesn\u2019t really have that luxury so you have to find other ways like buying short term treasuries to be able compete on rates.  However, you also don\u2019t have reserve requirements imposed upon you so you kind of manage your own liquidity risks.  Maybe one day, if governments recognize stability and liquidity of DAI and you have some kind of protocol that efficiently connects banks to MKR, banks could turn to MKR (instead of other banks or the fed) to fulfill reserve requirements using DAI.  It would become as simple as increasing the debt ceiling to a vault.  But right now, the process of finding loan demand in order to efficiently put extra deposits to use is a little clunky. ",

In a world where ETH is succesfull, mainnet will be a prohibitively expensive environment. Canonical DAI on L2s (optimistic/zk-rollups), side-chains (i.e. Polygon), and alternative L1s will presumably allow for scale of low-ticket transactions. So I would expect payment rails to compose these environments, where blockspace is cheaper. We should realistically be integrating with EM neo-banks and fintechs. Check out plans for multi-chain DAI here.

Think this is right. Capture entirely the customer experience and deliver the absolute best product. Brings up the question of how vertically integrated Maker wants to be vs. outsourcing legs to external experts. ",

                    "content": "When you explain the concept of \u201cOrganic Dai\u201d it reminds me of venmo dollars. Venmo users collect money on Venmo and exchange within the app between users. There is value in holding Venmo dollars in the application to be exchanged within the ecosystem. Users can also \u201ccash-out\u201d of the app to be redeemed into their bank accounts. Venmo dollars are just a means to an end. Organic Dai is the desire to hold Dai as an asset. Similar to holding a Venmo dollar. My understanding of TJ\u2019s analysis is that RWA will increase the \u201cholding power\u201d of Dai. Very large, institutional real estate firms, will hold Dai to transact within the network. This can only happen if MakerDAO has enough RWA value to stay in its ecosystem. I agree with TJ, this is not realistic for a few years. Market behavior is not there yet. TJ\u2019s point about \u201cthe distinction between RWA and D3M will disappear\u201d is interesting. Based on the definition, the range of what a D3M can be is huge. I think there will be \u201cderivatives\u201d of D3Ms. For example, real estate. SkyVest aims to be a \u201cderivative\u201d of a D3M, like Centrifuge. A robust ecosystem of \u201cderivatives\u201d will develop on top of D3M\u2019s for different RWA use-cases. TJ\u2019s point, as I understand it, is that RWA on a D3M has double-sided risk. RWA\u2019s credit risk and D3M\u2019s smart contract risk. It is particularly trickier than either on their own. TJ\u2019s thought process on B2B Dai vs. EZ Dai is an interesting differentiation. They both require an intermediary, like an exchange or DAO, the only difference is the type of investor. B2B Dai is safer, and qualifies for wholesale lending, because they are lending capital to businesses and institutions. EZ Dai is being lent to retail investors, which is inherently more risky. Figure and Mortgage are great examples of platform use-cases for EZ Dai. Access Vaults are Maker liquidity for exchanges to distribute to retail investors and Corporate Vaults are Maker liquidity for DAO\u2019s or D3M\u2019s for institutions/businesses. This is how I understood the post and my two cents. Any feedback is more than appreciated! Thank you @teej for the thoughtful piece! ",

Venmo now integrates with a lot of mobile apps too(uber, lyft, doordash) and even has great promotional offers to incentivize venmo as the default payment channel, creating more use cases for venmo dollars to remain in the ecosystem and therefore a longer duration that gets them higher interest rate at their participating banks. The Venmo Debit card is another example of expanding its use. Sadly though the increase in use cases may decrease as regulators are starting to get interested in its economic activity, beginning with the IRS. This is something that at the moment DAI has an advantage over fintech apps. ",
