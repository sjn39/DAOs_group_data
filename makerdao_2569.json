So I tried again but with the highest GAS fee\u2026 I woke up and all of a sudden it looks like both transactions were successful, and I have double the amount of DAI and my collatoralization ratio was at 157%\u2026 (I quickly paid some back to get it back above 200%) What happened here? How did the failed transaction succeed?  image3200\u00d71800 626 KB  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x181fa07adc38c55c804076218ad4d8477766c88ecdb0ce27c47ca3d55d710141 https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe134f94b30478ac53dd9734edec64ee1c75c4ee8f3067d576b1431b4cf916ef1 ",
