This is an illiquid token so market selling for the actual value is impossible. Little to nothing is known for the plans of the AKITA project (is it just a meme coin?) so holding for a longer period of time may lead to loss of all of its value.  Would giving it back make sense? Market Sell with insane (~98%) slippage? Keep it? Something else?  What should the gitcoin community do with these funds? Remember. Gitcoin\u2019s purpose is to fund open source (and public goods).

The harsh reality is that the damage has already been done and their holders are still in a position where they are holding to zero. If Gitcoin doesn\u2019t sell on to them, then experienced market makers and bots will continue to do it, at least if Gitcoin does it the money can help create a sustainable public goods. It\u2019s an awkward trolley problem, but only one side of the tracks has a good outcome for at least one party. (FWIW it sucks. We\u2019ve all been on the bad end of rugs. In this case spammy projects tried to use VB to shill vaporware and some of the biggest bag holders were early insiders. I\u2019m not saying there is one clearly good outcome, it\u2019s messy, but post damage, there is only one path that also serves a net benefit for the community.) ",

That said, Gitcoin has a mission, which is to make the open source community better, and it\u2019s their job to execute on that mission, so ultimately they should sell it. To do right by the AKITA community and assume the best, while also staying true to their mission, Gitcoin should sell at periodic intervals no matter the price (e.g., price insensitive selling) and publicize the selling plan and specific timings. That way member of the AKITA community can responding accordingly, while giving everyone a chance to stay true to their values. ",

Use the gains from that to airdrop DAI to the users up until a certain return (perhaps even whole value depending on how productive the assets end up being) and then after that future proceeds go to Gitcoin.

OTC will be the quickest solution, however, it isn\u2019t on-chain and trustless.   Gnosis auctions: Gnosis batch auctions let you execute trades on-chain and trustlessly without getting sandwiched/front run. (See article.) I think the largest trade executed so far is by Boson Protocol, which had >$50m of bids and ended up settling ~$26m. For the size of the AKITA position, we would need to do several auctions (10+ probably).   Selling on DEX: High slippage, low liquidity, chance of getting front run/sandwiched. Advantage: on-chain execution.   Hold on for longer: Solutions might emerge from the broader crypto community and/or the AKITA community. For example, @Crisgarner suggested token buybacks from AKITA as a potential solution. If we have confidence in the AKITA community, we can even decide to earmark these funds over a longer time horizon for Gitcoin grants. If we are selling large amounts of the tokens, we also need to time to understand if there are any legal implications from doing this.   Conclusion: We should understand any legal implications of executing a large sale, especially when it seriously impacts price. We should discuss a partial token sale with OTC desks and the Gnosis team. And we should hold the rest of the tokens till we get more clarity on the points above. I\u2019m happy to help facilitate the discussion with Gnosis and/or OTC desks. I\u2019m also helping the Crypto Relief team that received a $1B donation in $SHIB. We can coordinate efforts if needed.

I\u2019m sure our steward chose well. We initially tweeted to VB to see if he wouldn\u2019t mind burning our tokens, but seeing them go to help humanitarian efforts is something we would never disagree with. I hope we can all figure out a way to help each other, all we ever wanted was to be involved. I think we can all agree that Vitalik did not want the burden of having these tokens in his possession. With that being said, I cant really argue that our fate does not deserve to be in anyone else\u2019s hands, since the entire genesis of the project was centered around that fact.

Because you note that the goals of the communities are similar and seek collaboration, but, I can\u2019t help but have a healthy bit of skepticism towards that based on the decision to send tokens to VB in the first place. Racking it over in my mind, I can\u2019t imagine in which that decision was not done simply as a marketing ploy, which doesn\u2019t bode well for any trust or good faith in collaborating. While I have no interest in seeing individuals, who didn\u2019t know any better, getting hurt, there is a principle matter here in that the blockchain has no governing principles beyond the chain at the end of the day, and so if you sent them to VB you cannot then ask by social contract those tokens to not ever be used. I think most in this community will want a more olive branch and less fire and brimstone approach than I\u2019d advocate for, but I\u2019m sure they would still be interested in understanding the background on that decision as they weigh up how to collaborate.

If some tokens are left for GitCoin, a good way to put all tokens on auction is to use a bonding curve. The start price of the bonding curve could be set to a slightly lower than the market price, and the end price could be set to a higher price (e.g. 3x or 5x). The duration of the auction can be a long period of time (e.g. a few months). By using a bonding curve, you can obtain sustainable funding transparently without hurting the AKITA community. A suggestion \u2013 Curve Auction (a Dora Factory product) can help with the process, a curve of self-defined parameters can be created: Bonding Curve Factory. The bonding curve factory team will refund all costs generated from the auction to the GitCoin community. The Dora team is sharing the vision of funding public goods with GitCoin, and we hope that the result of selling AKITA tokens can contribute to the global open source community development, but in the same time make sure it\u2019s not at the cost of AKITA holder community.

I have worked for gitcoin (back in 2018), contributed to the platform, spent tens of thousands of dollars donating to grants and funding work on the platform, and got my very first eth ever on Gitcoin shortly after it launched. I consider myself very involved, and the long term success of gitcoin is deeply important to me. I hold these truths to be self evident:  Gitcoin community and the world of funding public goods + open source does not owe anything to the akita community. 0 of this was donated by the akita community, and 0 of it would have made it here if it were just up to them. These funds were removed from liquidity before being sent to gitcoin, where the akita community thought they would stay to increase their ability to dump. Gitcoin community will not benefit long term by becoming an akita connected product, which will likely happen if these funds are held for long. The goal of the gitcoin community is to fund open source sustainably in a way that has never been possible before. The goal of the akita community is a pyramid scheme to make token price increase as more people buy in\u2026 and memes these goals have competing interests whether or not we are willing to admit it.  with these in mind, the goals of the gitcoin multisig wallet members should be to turn as much AKITA into ETH and DAI, in order to fund open source and public goods, as fast as possible while extracting as much value as possible. A 98% dump right now does not extract as much value as we can so that should be mostly ruled out. However, we the members of gitcoin ( who have been honestly building a more transparent financial system and other non-meme-pyramid-scheme based crypto projects on gitcoin for years now) do not owe the akita community anything, and should not hold these coins for very long with the reasoning that dumping will hurt them somehow. One plan to extract as much value from this for open source and public good funding:  dump some small percentage now, maybe not more than would crash the price by 10-20% create a lending pool on CREAM and lend as much as possible out for DAI and ETH use these funds to buy equity in Gitcoin the company (not the community) back from consensys and VCs sell in non-dex places where there may be less slippage: OTC, gnosis auctions, and back to akita community create akita yield farm to increase liquidly again and dump more over time Set hard goals of not holding any significant amount for more than 6 months  Edit: re Akita team members asking us to hold a percentage of the coins.     relic:  I am just leading a community interested in being something more than a meme.   This is just dishonest. Your project\u2019s website clearly describes itself as \u201cinspired by elon musk, little brother of dogecoin, meme-based\u201d I\u2019m not against holding a small percentage in good faith. But holding it so the price doesnt collapse to the advantage of akita holders, is directly disadvantaging open source projects for good we could be funding instead, which is my primary goal. ",

This is like a game of musical chairs, the music has already stopped. The only question is who is sitting in the chair when it is all over. Will it be Gitcoin or will it be market makers and bots who eat Akita buyers alive? Because a quick glance at the transactions for the Akita pool on Uniswap show that\u2019s already what is happening. The retail investors are getting destroyed because they were sold on a pipe dream meme token - and that sucks. But Gitcoin not selling doesn\u2019t change that. The only scenario I see where Akita users get anything out of it is if after the selling the Ethereum is put to work and gains yield that gives them some pay back to a threshold.

Gitcoin\u2019s purpose is to fund open source (and public goods) gitcoin is for open source, Akita is a meme coin, (after a short read) which aims to move towards real use case, which is built upon open source.  in finance terms, there is a mechanism to have decentralized finance.  Therefore, defi and open source both in one meme token.  meme is their way to do marketing.  behind the curtain, there are hardcore technical coding from open source, possibility of improving to the next version. i think we shouldn\u2019t bash each other like this.  we are both in the open source community. and\u2026 a research on Profile - Adamscochran - Gitcoin Governance which has been voicing out strongly against Akita, sounds like fudding, as this guy joined only 7 hours ago.  if you are not going to make constructive suggestion to the gitcoin community, please stay neutral. disclaimer:  I joined 10 minutes ago.  look at my statement and see if what i have said is right or wrong. to properly handle this huge windfall given by vb, we should first think.  Has gitcoin been surviving with or without vb\u2019s contribution?  someone mentioned vb\u2019s contribution as tainted money (this guy joined 1 day ago) .  I would say I would like to throw back the tokens back to them or burn them off, solved all the headache. but that\u2019s not the right way to manage this situation.  JimWarren joined 1hr ago, so he might be coming from a perspective as Akita token holder. (sorry about that) when suggesting to dump the token, it is akin to some manipulator in stock market with a huge holding dumping their stock and causing the price to crash.  in the real world, we have regulations to monitor these.  but in the decentralized world, are we going to do this?  I understand this is permissionless and trustless system, you can do what you can with what you have on your hands.  but that would create chaos.  that\u2019s why we need governance in blockchain, in cryptocurrency, there is a community voting system. planckmatt suggestion sounds good.  for Akita community to offer Gitcoin the same amount of funds if we are to sell Akita token now.  price would possible doubled BUT nobody will be willing to give their token up.  (Akita holders would love you for this) my humble suggestion:  if we are to sell, for gitcoin to spread the selling over 3 years.  that means 50% of Akita tokens (what we have now) divided by (365*2) 1095.    that would amount to 0.0456% daily.  this percentage is calculated to be the no. 65 Akita holder (quite a big dent already).  These funds are not us to begin with.  even if we get a fraction of it, we could still do good with public goods funding.  and considering the humanity impact it will cause the holder of Akita tokens.  you could say most of them might be degen and moonboy but are we going to judge them and punish them like this?  who are we at gitcoin to do that?  we are not at the level to judge. the other suggestion is to work with the this relic from Akita, (please confirm his identity by some means that he is the dev - sorry need to factual) to produce a passive income to have funding rolling in for the years to come.  we could say that this is our golden goose.  worse case, we get 1/3 of the funds (hopefully during the period of collaboration, funds rolls in weekly) after collaboration as project fails. remember what lefterisjp said: Gitcoin\u2019s purpose is to fund open source (and public goods).  we are both in the open source and now Akita could be our evergreen funding wallet for years to come if we managed it properly.

                    "content": "I\u2019d like to just try to aggregate and summarize some ideas mentioned until now and add some opinions to them:  Option 1: Use AKITA for funding The basic premise of this option is using AKITA to fund the Grants pools. The question is how best to execute this. Communication with the AKITA community is likely something a public-goods group should do - Gitcoin does not have to let the AKITA community decide how much of the funds should be used, nor how they should be used, but communicating with the community about it is likely beneficial. (Though it may require a large amount of patience and compassion.) Similarly, dumping everything is unlikely to benefit anyone. A slow burn rate communicated clearly is likely to be more sustainable for the AKITA community, and seems more ethically in line with Gitcoin. A potential downside is if there is significant abandonment of AKITA (also called dumping) on this news, but I do not think Gitcoin\u2019s goals should be maximization of financial value. tl;dr if Gitcoin would like to use the AKITA for funding public goods, it should be done on a schedule transparently, and at a burn rate that is more sustainable  Option 2: Don\u2019t Touch It Mainly inspired by @tjayrush , there is the option of not touching something antithetical to Gitcoin. In this option, Gitcoin should likely either burn the funds or pass the bag back to Vitalik. Finding an AKITA community steward seems an unlikely possibility unless there is overwhelming AKITA community support, which would be hard to gauge imho. Burning should not adversely affect AKITA holders, if anything, reducing supply should make the value of their holdings go up, but is still taking a direct financial choice with the funds. Sending them back would be the most pure way for Gitcoin to wash their hands of the funds. I am a member of the Ethereum Cat Herders. If there is any way we can assist Gitcoin with whatever Gitcoin chooses, or in facilitating comms, feel free to reach out. ",

I   Just so you know funding public goods is Gitcoin\u2019s mission (gitcoin.co/mission) so thats why you\u2019re getting a lot of heat about that topic.     Dai:  Let\u2019s solve the problem first before you \u201cfund public goods\u201d.   Curious how you\u2019d frame the problem here? I\u2019m mindful that the Gitcoin community\u2019s problem (how do we solve public goods) might be different than the AKITA community (I\u2019m only guessing here but I guess it might be : how do we not crash the market / destroy our pgoress?).  Protocol politics is the art of the possible, so my north star would be coordinating to find a path forward that meets both community\u2019s goals.     Dai:  @owocki Do you know him? If he worked for GitCoin.   Yes he worked for Gitcoin (the company) a few years ago but does not anymore.

The reality is, $5M isn\u2019t going to create a self-sustaining Gitcoin, but $100M just might. To extract $100M or anything close to that amount, the AKITA community will need to not only mature, but grow large enough to engender market demand that can sustain the multiples of millions of dollars in liquidity Gitcoin would need to support the sale of their position. This reality links, and ultimately aligns, the two communities. Even though Gitcoin has been gifted AKITA\u2019s treasury, the public goods community has something else to offer AKITA , legitimacy. Having a noble purpose to support open source projects takes AKITA beyond just being one of many DOGE-clones into a more sustainable status as the go to coin for those who want to meme and do good. I believe this is the way to maximize the potential of the opportunity given to Gitcoin. From a practical perspective, after a few basic tweets are published stating that co-community opportunities are being explored and $AKITA holders can be confident there will be no short term dumping of the coin by Gitcoin, then some co-community building begin. This could include:  A portion of the funds to be allocated for bounties that build and support the AKITA ecosystem. A special Round 10 sponsorship by the AKITA community where CLR Matching of $AKITA can be gamified so that AKITA community members have additional sway in the matching. Between-round funding initiatives supported by or promoted with AKITA. Considering there isn\u2019t ever much action between funding rounds, this could add a bit of life to the platform during down times. Initiate partnerships with educational platforms like rabbithole.gg to onboard the AKITA community into the broader Ethereum ecosystem.  The grand irony in this is that the most valuable thing here isn\u2019t the money, but the access to a large community that could potentially be evangelized and mobilized to work on behalf of open source and the overall public good. If that\u2019s successful, it literally unlocks a war chest that can be used to sustain Gitcoin in perpetuity. This approach is idealistic, sure, but offers the highest potential reward and since Gitcoin isn\u2019t struggling, why not shoot for the moon? ",

The question I land on is why should Akita receive the support from this community to develop it into something meaningful and useful, when there are already so many underfunded, understaffed, and non-meme non-PnD projects out there that could do with the support? If we had been just handed cold cash, how would that have been invested? most likely put up as match funds for the grants rounds. We have this ball of energy, with which we can invigorate projects we (the gitcoin grants donors) think deserve it. Does Akita deserve this energy? Is there something more deserving of it? If akita team is committed to their work then they can create a gitcoin grants profile, explain what they are doing, and be applying for the funding on the same level as all other projects in the space. My conclusion is sell as much as you can as soon as you can. There is no guilt here, the money will go into supporting community projects as gitcoin always does. Even if you sell the 10% for the $5m, you\u2019ll still have 90% of the tokens left, you could airdrop them to gitcoin grants donors and then the community might see that as some incentive to do something with akita and give it a reason to have value. If the plan is to sell you should act swiftly.  If you wait around for a vote, then as soon as the vote leans towards selling the prices will collapse. ",

A sell operation to DAI should only be bounded by the market mechanics, our general ethical responsibility, and Gitcoin\u2019s mission. It would be good to know from more experienced traders how to do this sell w/ the following constraints:  simplicity general transparency unload it all within a few weeks  With these in mind, I would propose making the operation public, and selling the AKITA token at regular intervals in blocks that keep getting larger.

Your options are really memory pool bypass swaps, or hoping an OTC market maker like Wintermute or Alameda would take it on for you. Unlike the SHIBA token, ATIKA doesn\u2019t have the major markets that those kinds of traders operate on and so I doubt you\u2019d get much. Since that leaves you on chain you get a MEV/dark forest issue, anything you publish gets front run either when its in the mempool, or manually when announced on a timeline. I think the balance is to announce that you are selling the asset and the intention is clear, but not to announce the mechanic. I think the social contract obligation of a large holder should be treated no differently than that of a small holder in this case, so I dispute the claim of it being unethical as it isn\u2019t Gitcoin who built the project or hyped it. But, I can see middle ground merit in making clear that they plan to sell the token and after that doing as they see best fit for Gitcoin. The other problem baked into the assumption of many of the users (whom I\u2019d guess are from the ATIKA community) is that they propose other models will work as those models assume ATIKA will be worth more (or anything) at future time X. While I disagree with that view, even then we\u2019d have to consider that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. ",

Do they deserve it just because they hold a meme token? Funding public good is your business (every business creates some value, including yours), and you benefit from that. Maybe temporarily you don\u2019t benefit from revenue, but you benefit from growing your platform, which gives you higher valuation. So it\u2019s definitely not all about \u201cdoing good to the world\u201d, if I were you, I would think about using this money to secure the company\u2019s funding source too. But if the AKITA community is doomed because of you, you have blood on your hand. That\u2019s why I said, let\u2019s STOP talking about funding public goods for a moment. Communism murdered millions of people, but in the first place they had good cause \u2013 to improve public goods too. It looks like your community is talking about how you can use OTCs, Defis to extract value while trying to ignore the problem of AKITA community. When you are discussing it, they have already lost so much money. Having said that, I do think there are some ways you can work with AKITA community. There are a few possibilities moving ahead.  dump the tokens and extract cash from it \u2013 blood is on your hand. work with @relic and AKITA team, come up with a common goal (including funding public goods of course), and make AKITA a token to support public goods. (Note that GitCoin team might want to issue token (or maybe not, who knows) but you don\u2019t have a good excuse to do it, it\u2019s an opportunity to convert a token that works for your goal, without having the burden to be a token issuer. But, you do need to design a token economics that actually works, so that it has some real utility) If you can\u2019t work with AKITA team in the end, you should probably just return most of the tokens back to AKITA community and as @relic mentioned, they would like you to keep 10%, which is good enough for you guys to secure enough funding to \u201cfund public goods\u201d, by whatever means (OTC, yield farming, Gonsis auction, bondingcurve, whatever) I see previously discussed.

There are already hundreds of other projects in the web3 ecosystem which that energy could be put into supporting. We have to ask, does akita as a project align with gitcoins aims? If we were to support akita what are we actually supporting? Has anyone read the contract code? Do we know anything about the token distribution or authors? Apparently it is a fork of shiba, so do the devs even code? Can they responsibly manage this project if it got bigger? What are the values of the project? because it looks like a meme token intended to try and pump and make some people rich, is that what gitcoin and the community want to support?  Is this the most deserving project for these funds? Or is it a big distraction that will sap a lot of time and energy? If we were to work with the akita community I would want to see them signal their intentions by having large token holders and devs place their tokens in a vesting contract locked up for a few years. We would need to see a plan of what they are working on and importantly understand if they are capable of delivering. We treat this like an investment and it is up to akita community to prove to us that they are worthy of this investment and can deliver real value (not just money) to the wider community. So far I am not convinced investing in akita is a better option than investing in all the other projects around that could do with the funds, the developers, the community energy.

I like the idea of trying to sell at least a portion (~10%?) of the AKITA proceeds via Gnosis auctions. It should be straightforward to do. I\u2019m in touch with the Gnosis auctions team and they\u2019d be willing to help. The largest auction they\u2019ve executed so far is for Boston Protocol, for which they ended up settling $26m. We will have to run multiple auctions to execute a larger trade. Putting the proceeds of the Gnosis auction sale in a Yearn vault is an extra step - we can discuss this after completing the auction. @Adamscochran brought up the point of being front run / sandwiched:  I think the challenge is that the simplicity, transparency and timeline here all counter act the effectiveness of the trade as the asset is so microcap that it is monopolized by bots, market makers and dark forest types.  Batch auctions enable matching of limit orders of buyers and sellers with the same clearing price for all participants. So they are designed to reduce the risk of frontrunning, gas bidding wars, and lower the amount of extracted value from auctioneers and bidders. ",

I hope some of these new folks from the AKITA community know that our Team @ Gitcoin has an entire eco-system of actual public goods projects in motion. We are running hack-a-thons, accelerator programs, and an entire bounty network that cannot be put on hold will we deal with this AKITA situation. Secondarily no one has ever accused us of \u201cUsing Public Goods\u201d to extract value from other communities or to harm anyone in any way. That being said we didn\u2019t ask for this responsibility, not @owocki , not the community, not me and I will not apologize for taking our sweet time to make the right decision that protects our community and ensures that we are taking the voices of others who might be affected into consideration as well. We have spoken with @relic and we are discussing various proposal\u2019s as we speak. I am impressed with the fervor that you guys bring to the table trying to get this thing done, but please DON\u2019T COME TO OUR COMMUNITY FORUM AND START TALKING SHIT ABOUT OUR FOUNDERS !!!

I have mostly been listening + digesting the conversation, trying to prioritize the community voices - and be a voice that encourages digesting information + prioritizing deliberation over hasty decisions.  I\u2019ve also been spending time getting to know AKITA core team and token holders, trying to understand what drives them and drives the project.  (It is our mission at Gitcoin to help builders build/fund the open web, and unpacking this situation is kinda a part of that IMHO)   By understanding each other, we can understand if there is a foundation for a positive relationship between the two communities in the future. Maybe at some point I will write up a post that tries to synthesize what I\u2019ve heard and/or laying out where/how to vote on this, but even if I do that I want to again emphasize that this is the community\u2019s choice, and not Gitcoin Holdings (the company).  I do not plan to put my finger on the scale, but I think one role I\u2019m being asked to play by a few of you is helping create consensus on how we could get to a decision that has any finality (this discussion is our first big debate on this forum, so some precedent needs to be set). In the meantime, a few people have asked me why Vitalik sent Gitcoin the tokens.  With his permission, I\u2019m sharing a screencap of something he sent me the morning of the transfer.  I\u2019m not sure if this adds to the discussion or not but a few of you have asked so figured I\u2019d pass along (again, only with Vitaliks permission am I sharing this)  Remember to breathe people, @owocki ",

OBSERVATIONS from vb action:  shiba and akita experiences sharp decline partly from these vb actions and doge decline.  Do take note that as our discussion drags, our value in Akita reduced by a great percentage. a crypto group in twitter started an action against ethereum as retaliation for \u201crug pulling\u201d shiba. gathering size is currently a small 883, compared to 124k shiba telegram channel members.  other group not monitored yet.  ACTIONS and possibly consequences:    sell all, killing akita in the process,     hate group will be there waiting.  generating 43k of Akita holders as hater at an instand.  I hope they are not in our ecosystem, don\u2019t like to deal with sabotager popping up out of nowhere. we can forget about funding public goods, we have become a destroyer while we should be a creator. even if the akita hate group don\u2019t boycott us, our competitors with a better image will rise up. (but we have a huge injection of funds now) our image tainted.     part sell part hold.     systematically sell a portion of Akita token to get our fundings, over a few years.  Risk: if Akita crashed to zero in the next few months, we get near to nothing.  Reward: if Akita token value rises (need to consult reliable trader to get a sensing), we get a funding machine for a longer period (more years), or we can increase our systematic amount to sell, maintaining healthy trading chart. if we decide to sell, we should not broadcast our decision here.  it will cause panic and the result of it, before we can even sell a single Akita token, is that the value drops to worthless in 3-5 minutes.   to get a  sensing of crypto, I joined several telegram crypto channel and fud is a serious issue that spread like wild fire, having the ability to destroy 99% value in an instant.     special funding segment : fund public goods in Akita tokens, telling them that this will be the currency in use and condition that it should not be cash out for the entire duration of sponsor by themselves.  big ticket items should be paid in Akita tokens and that vendor (furniture, computers.  advise to vendor Akita is currently illiquid and there are slippage, thereby a premium will be paid to vendor) are allowed to cash out by themselves (gitcoin->sponsor company->vendors).  payment of salary to employees should be time delayed/locked for a period of 6months (6 months for Akita to recover to pre-vb saga or crashed).  internally, company could pay employees 82.5%cash/20%Akita (2.5% risk premium for employee\u2019s benefit) 65%cash/40%Akita (5% risk premium for employee\u2019s benefit) 47.5%cash/60%Akita (7.5% risk premium for employee\u2019s benefit) 30%cash/80%Akita (10% risk premium for employee\u2019s benefit) 12.5%cash/100%Akita (12.5% risk premium for employee\u2019s benefit)    of course these risk premium can be adjusted accordingly as their HR\u2019s preference to attract talent.  return all token   defeat the purpose of vb sending it to us in the first place, but if we do not want to deal with the \u201chands in the blood\u201d, we could send it all back to him, tell him it is difficult for us to deal with this matter and could he send us usdt instead.  if he don\u2019t send, we get on with our lives.  lost a great opportunity to regain our control of gitcoin from vc.  alternatively, he might send Akita tokens to covid-19 relief.  the other side has a mandate and noble reason to sell off shiba to cash for the emergency issue they are facing.  our side don\u2019t have that emergency urgency to liquidate Akita token to cash but we face the risk as mentioned above if Akita token crashed to zero in the next few months.    all eyes are seeing how we handle this issue.  how we can progress forward will depend on the vote. another is to for both Gitcoin and Akita to request for binance listing.  listing might not be good for Akita as usually price will crash on the first minute, but we get to sell our token progressively without slippage.  The visibility from vb\u2019s action has propel both Shiba and Akita, therefore as head of Gitcoin and Akita, do have a talk with binance.  nothing to lose. ",

There was a ZERO-PERCENT chance VB was ever going to rug all those fresh entry-level retail investors on his own network. To those who thought this was probable, or even possible \u2013 please, get out of investing and finance \u2013 your judgement is nonexistent. Like many others reading this thread, discussing amongst the other hundreds of thousands of members of these dog coin Telegram groups, we were appalled and horrified to read how casually and flippantly the idea of dumping on all of us was tossed around here. \u201cSanctimonious\u201d is the correct word, as stated by another user in response to Adamscochran\u2019s brutal half-baked proposals which were never an option, and would never have worked. Adamscochran\u2019s emotionally vacant \u201cfire and brimstone\u201d proposals were beyond \u201cdisgustingly sanctimonious\u201d, as stated. They were truly sociopathic (lacking any semblance of actual empathy for the tens of thousands of innocent investors affected by his heinous plans, which he justified to himself through sheer mental gymnastics, stating that the victims were already victims for investing in an \u201cinferior\u201d asset, so why feel bad for going ahead and MAKING VICTIMS OUT OF THEM), hypocritical (\u201cdumping is bad, we\u2019ve all been rugged, but let\u2019s dump $AKITA\u201d), and completely antithetical to Gitcoin\u2019s stated mission and purpose for existing (\u201cwe\u2019re so good and great, let\u2019s do something unimaginably evil to others to raise money to carry on with our work being so good and great\u201d). Indeed, patently disgusting. A textbook example of the ruthlessness of the powerful! Back to the future of $AKITA and Gitcoin. Half of something worth nothing (and illiquid at that) is worth nothing. But a sizable majority portion of something with widespread popularity, adoption, and enormous value is worth a significant fortune. THIS is and was the only way forward for Gitcoin. I am extremely relieved VB has finally broken radio silence on the matter, and I trust owocki and others I\u2019ve heard from in the Telegram groups will follow suit disclosing the fantastic plan for Gitcoin\u2019s $AKITA tokens which was communicated to relic, myself, and others. For those of you who can\u2019t yet see \u2013 these dog coins are an entry-portal into the world of DeFi, the systems you\u2019re building, and the future of money. It would be absolutely insane to discourage this in any way. You\u2019ve got lightning in a bottle right now, and with proper INVESTMENT (vs. cashing out for a tiny fraction), you will have a very powerful source of funding for the foreseeable future, as intended by VB, and supported by the $AKITA community 100%.

I do not think this was Vitalik\u2019s intention, but regardless this is where we are now. I think there is only one solution here and that is a solution that wouldn\u2019t benefit Akita directly nor would it benefit the Gitcoin community directly. The solution here would be to not cause any more harm to the Crypto community that has already been done and I believe that Vitalik sending the AKITA to Gitcoin was in line with his trust in the teams here that they would do the right thing with it and not be blinded by personal greed. We are all in this space for the same reasons at the end of the day, whether you\u2019re from 1 end of the spectrum where you\u2019re gambling on memecoins or whether you\u2019re on the other end where you\u2019re trying to find elegant solutions to real world problems. Now is a time more than any other where we need to stick together and workout how we can leverage this sticky situation to our advantage. There are already some positive things that have come out of it such as the exposure Gitcoin and Akita have both received. We need to double down on that and show the World that the crypto space, despite all the rug pulls, scams, hacks, and other malicious activities, there are some very reliable people in here with a good hearts and that movement can start with Gitcoin. At the end of the day the tokens are tokens, whatever is done with them is secondary to the intention of the man controlling what is done to them. My solution would be for Gitcoin to control these tokens as a sign of good faith but not to sell them. If AKITA can trust Vitalik with them, surely there is more re-assurance in keeping them with Gitcoin in a multisig rather than just keeping them in the hands of 1 man. How does Akita benefit from this? Holders would sleep well knowing that ~50% of the supply is being held by some of the most trustworthy and informed people in the crypto space. We can leverage this to our advantage by marketing \u201cIf Gitcoin is holding, I\u2019m holding\u201d. How does Gitcoin benefit from this? The exposure as being the de-facto Governance over crypto projects. Hell, I had no idea what Gitcoin even was until this entire thing played out but I\u2019m glad to have now seen that such a community does indeed exist. I can see a future where tokens launch and send tokens to Gitcoin\u2019s address instead of a burn address. Why? Sending a portion of their supply to a burn address is an irreversible action and with the progress that the Crypto industry makes every day there are always elegant solutions around the corner. Sending half your supply to a burn address is a fix today, but not necessarily the best solution in 2 years time. So why don\u2019t tokens just keep 50% of their supply in their team wallets? Simple, I\u2019d trust the Gitcoin community easily over any project that launches and keeps the tokens with them. Having Gitcoin control 50% of the supply is an investment into the future of Crypto and not just the token in itself. How does Crypto benefit from this? This one is pretty self explanatory but by seeing these acts of kindness and a show of how different communities can come together as one, it would create a much stronger bond within the space and would make good publicity. Yes, Akita is a memecoin (Or at least started as one) but that doesn\u2019t mean we can disregard their  huge community and hurting them will only be doing damage to the greater sum of this space. The only caveat I\u2019d have with this solution is that 50% of the supply isn\u2019t necessary for Gitcoin to hold and doesn\u2019t really bring any inherent value over holding 25% of the supply for example. AKITA holders are hurting so a proposal would be to burn 25% and keep the remaining 25% within the Gitcoin multisig until a more elegant solution is minted. Thank you for listening to my TED talk.

Hell, I had no idea what Gitcoin even was until this entire thing played out but I\u2019m glad to have now seen that such a community does indeed exist. I can see a future where tokens launch and send tokens to Gitcoin\u2019s address instead of a burn address.   I dont think we should be encouraging that at all. We do not want more projects started sending half their supply, leaving us with a loaded gun pointed at their head. Its lunacy. I do worry that if we start legitimising meme projects, especially out of some guilt trip, it could lead to more hurt than selling the tokens now. I can see the \u201cits supported by gitcoin\u201d comments in the PnD telegram chats.  We hear a lot about how we\u2019d hurt akita holders, but the damage to gitcoins reputation could be much worse. being \u201ckind\u201d to the akita holders could have an upside of introducing them to gitcoin, bringing lots of new faces, that could be cool! But we could also be saying to them that meme tokens are valuable, having no plans can make you rich and happy. We would be saying that buying a token designed with no purpose and with half the distribution sent to one person, was a great idea! and is fully supported by the wider community. why would we do that? because its funny? is that good enough? what if we end up hurting more people in the long term?

This sort of top-down tyrannical paternalism is always folly. \u201cPaternalism: the policy or practice on the part of people in positions of authority of restricting the freedom and responsibilities of those subordinate to them in the subordinates\u2019 supposed best interest.\u201d Is dumping the tokens in ANYONE\u2019S best interest besides Gitcoin\u2019s? No. So let\u2019s not pretend. Destroying others in order for you to get ahead is what it has always been: robbery, looting, and pillaging at worst - parasitic vampirism at best. Back to the folly of paternalism: It is not up to any one of us to censor the entire cryptoverse in the way in which we alone see fit. This sort of unilateral action (not supported by anyone but you) is myopic, tyrannical, and stifles innovation - everything Gitcoin is supposed to be against! The whole reason the cryptosphere is so attractive to many is because it\u2019s a new frontier! It\u2019s freedom! In a world completely bogged down by overreaching big government and corrupt institutions - you actually propose that what crypto needs is our freedom to be restricted in these various ways you alone see fit? I am here to tell you, you could not pick a more assured losing strategy if you tried. And to the point: No one is asking you, Gitcoin, or anyone to \u201clegitimize\u201d meme coins. They are already legitimate! Look at their widespread popularity! You can\u2019t argue with market forces. Supply will rise up to meet demand - period. All we are asking you to do is not destroy $AKITA. That\u2019s it. No straw man fallacy about legitimizing memes or leading the ignorant masses to their doom. That is not what\u2019s on the chopping block here. It\u2019s the future of $AKITA. Will you act as stewards, protecting and nurturing your windfall and our investment - or will you plunder us, at the expense of tens of thousands of innocent people? No one - absolutely no one - views these sorts of high-volatility meme coins as assured pathways to everlasting wealth and happiness. Notwithstanding the fact that $AKITA has a real, actionable plan to become more than just a meme coin, and an extremely strong and passionate community to help assure that becomes a reality - these sorts of speculative coins are fun. Period. The ups and downs give you exits and entries, allowing newcomers with limited patience and risk tolerance to play the game within a timeframe that is acceptable to them. Without the volatility, the game would not be fun - and no one would be interested. You\u2019d have a fraction of the newcomers you\u2019re seeing coming into crypto right now. And this would be a net-negative for Gitcoin and crypto as a whole. Do you know how many people are still out there who have no idea that their life savings is being inflated away? And that the permanent, unstoppable upward trend of crypto asset values is as much the debasement of their fiat currency as it is the success of crypto? These people will open their eyes voluntarily, in their own time, as they are able to see more and more. You need to create as many doorways as possible to let them in. And you need to roll out the red carpet at each of these doorways and present crypto in a way that is appealing to the tastes of whichever individual may be walking by. This means variety. Yes you have your blue chip \u201cinvestment grade\u201d coins, and your idealistic utopia projects. But you also have fun things, interesting things, promising things, risky (exciting) things, etc. Take it from a businessman: curb appeal matters. You have to have ways to draw new customers into your store. This is what the meme coins are doing. If you want people to care about what you\u2019re doing, you need to attract them here in the first place. You catch flies with honey, guys. Honey! Not vinegar. Again, as a businessman, I am here to tell you that you can not fight market forces. Customer demand wants what it wants, and supply WILL rise to meet it - whether you\u2019re the supplier or not! Whether you agree with it, approve of it, or not! If customers want cheeseburgers, it is not up to us to tell them that steaks are superior! Our job, as businessmen, is to create value for the customer by solving their problem with the most affordable solution (the best cheeseburger for the money). Meme coins are that. You can not argue with popularity. The market has spoken = the People have spoken. And let us not forget what happens when the people grow unhappy with those in authority. It is not up to you, me, or anyone to try to steer the whole world of crypto to suit any one of our individual visions. This is no \u201cguilt trip\u201d. The consequences here are as real as it gets. Please, have some reverence for the significant burden of responsibility placed upon you at the moment. The fate of tens of thousands is literally up in the air right now, waiting for your announcement. Look at what happened to $AKITA\u2019s price last night when the news of VB burning the Shiba tokens got out. We are all waiting with bated breath. Will you act as good stewards, or will you plunder us? The world wants to know. I hope you\u2019ll choose wisely. ",

They see meme coins as an opportunity to make a quick buck and are more focused on getting the next listing than the real issue at hand. This is a shame but Isaac I think you\u2019ve been in the space for too long and forgotten what it\u2019s like to be the average person venturing into the unknown. Let me explain. I started in a very similar way, not with a meme coin but with others. I made my first investment on Revolut and soon after on Binance without understanding the technology or knowing the fundamental drivers of each project. I\u2019ve made some money along the way which I am very grateful for but 6 months later I have started to understand the potential and the real word applications. It is exciting and happy to be an early(ish) adopter. Upon reflection I believe that most \u2018normal\u2019 people enter the market for the same reasons, they see it as an investment opportunity. This may not be the right reason, but it is a reason nonetheless, and it is one step closer to mainstream use. You\u2019ve made it clear that you do not support meme coins and anyone who has been in a while knows the danger of the but before long I have no doubt new investors will have the same outlook at myself. It seems pointless to ask the plan for $AKITA when it\u2019s clear it was not created to change the world. Ironically it is making changes in that the majority of holders appear to be new. Collapsing a coin with tens of thousands of new and small investors will not solve the issue. The team at Gitcoin have a far better understanding than I and I\u2019m sure will make the right decision, I just hope not at the expense of early investors who will not only loose money but also faith in crypto. Just to clarify I am not an $AKITA holder, I\u2019m just interested to see how events will unfold and what can be learned along the way. A key lesson is to not give away 50% of all supply! ",

Without governance, its just market capitalization that is in Gitcoin\u2019s hands, the path of the project can be independent from the token\u2019s price. Theres really no onus on Gitcoin here. However on a separate topic, assuming funds are effectively liquidated, I think that there should be some consideration made towards establishing a MetaCartel style venture DAO that participates in the early funding of open-source projects coming out of Gitcoin Kernel. Gitcoin has unique access to the best new talent and projects in web3, the previous two cohorts each with ~10-25 projects eventually funded. If the concern is the perpetual funding of open-source community goods, significant returns are required for this funding to mean anything on a long term basis. With a venture DAO, Gitcoin\u2019s community multisig (or whatever it becomes) would then have access to these potentially high r/r opportunities, have projects coming out of Kernel with aligned incentives, and without LP\u2019s to pay out, have the ability to sustain this funding perpetually. There would definitely be questions as to selection processes, etc., so I\u2019m unsure how realistic this is in comparison to just throwing the funds into some protocol, however its clearly a step that would lead to growth across all of the web3 community, and leaves a clear route for open-source funding beyond hope for continued Gitcoin Round matching. Edit: This took awhile to get approved/posted so apologies, conversation may have moved past it. Edit 2: It had in fact moved past it, with the context of vitalik specifically saying this is meant to fund gitcoin grants rather than gitcoin\u2019s overall mission statement, I\u2019d likely put my vote into throwing funds into yearn and perpetually funding grants that way. Edit 3: If we go the yearn direction, I would STRONGLY add the suggestion that profit be calculated on an adjusted basis. If the funds yield 15% APY, one should only be able to withdraw and contribute 10% of that 15% to gitcoin grants in order to ensure the value of funds are retained over time and not lost to inflation.

Like @owocki I\u2019ve been listening + digesting the conversation and trying to get a sense of all the options the community has in mind. I truly believe there\u2019s potential for a positive-sum outcome here as in all things crypto, and we should strive towards that. So far from the discussion, I\u2019m noticing a few key options that I want to try to distill down: 1) Sell a fixed percentage of tokens and burn/hold the rest This option seems to be the most popular, but it seems like there\u2019s a lot of variance in how much people want to sell. Some folks like @cupOjoseph think we should sell everything while others like @relic want to keep the number closer to 5%. On average, it seems like most people in the thread are on board with somewhere around 10-20%. As I think most people in the thread know by now, Vitalik ended up burning around 80% of his SHIB so there\u2019s some interesting precedent here but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily the right decision. In terms of how to sell, @HelloShreyas mentioned a few strong options above, for example finding an OTC provider, drip selling into the market, or setting up a Gnosis auction. Other folks like @Crisgarner have even suggested some kind of buyback program. 2) Hold the tokens and use them in collaboration with the AKITA ecosystem @omnianalytics and @Enrique have both suggested that we simply keep the funds but dedicate them to bounties, and specific quadratic funding rounds that benefit the AKITA ecosystem, the idea being that the most valuable thing here isn\u2019t the money but the community. Others like @papa_raw and @castall have suggested that we could hold the tokens but distribute them as part of the matching amount to grantees. All of this feels very positive sum, but as @isaac and others mentioned there are opportunity costs and maybe even potential risks to putting our energy behind AKITA. 3) Do nothing, send the funds back to Vitalik As always the empty set is a subset of every set. As @tjayrush and @cryptowanderer have suggested, we could simply send the funds back to Vitalik or burn them entirely to move on to other things. This would allow us to avoid taking a side, and minimize opportunity costs, but at the cost of funds that could go towards Ethereum public goods. A Suggestion on how to move forward I noticed that @coopahtroopa put together a great template. No matter which of the options above (or others) we want to move forward with, I think we need to really clearly articulate the reasons why and consider both the potential, the downside risk, the second order effects, and so on. Do we have any folks that would be willing to take a shot at drafting some proposals and posting the final drafts here for the community to review? ",

(We dont have access to the AKITA contract, so we will stake AKITA with PFX to yield a governance token) why is the git repo empty?(Its not) why did you choose avalanche over other chains? ( Avalanche is an underrated blockchain with a team of really smart people, Avalanche\u2019s consensus model is winning awards in computer science, Avalanche is already a next GEN L1 blockchain. Room for growth. ) I joined the discord but it seems people are only talking about the token price and exchange listings, as i kind of expected. I am surprised how little conversation there is about gitcoin being sent 50% of the supply\u2026 why hasn\u2019t an announcement been made to the community? (Yes the community has been well informed.) honestly, it looks like the usual pnd token,(really the usual 1B market cap PND token huh) like the hundreds of other cloned tokens.(right all of those other ones ended up on gitcoin forums fighting for their lives) I really don\u2019t get why we should be supporting this.\" ( You should be supporting this because this is what decentralization is supposed to be. People coming together from many places to do one thing. We were literally rugged, and a team formed. A team of like minded people that wanted to fix a situation together. Why would you not want to support us? We are real people, have become friends over the past 5 months. This is a part of our lives now. We are part of Ethereum history whether you like it or not.) \u201cWe can fund hundreds of projects, toys, hackathons, using the tokens that have been donated to us. Or we could fund akita? Just asking questions before we give up a lot of money for a meme.\u201d ( I kinda feel how i\u2019d expect a person experiencing racism to feel, the \u201cfor a meme\u201d line is kind of played out. We\u2019re working hard, we made our identities public, we are really funding this ourselves, I just find this really offensive, probably because I have actually worked hard. Sure you can fund hundreds of projects, by killing the one that actually worked to get where they are without funding, how ironic.) \u201cThere is no authority but yourself \u201d and Isaac apparently.

Now Akita has to justify themselves to you, are you actually being serious right now? Why was 50% sent to VB in the first place? It was sent to him as a token burn wasnt it? The only reason VB sold some Shiba and made the mistake of sending Gitcoin the AKITA is because ETH couldn\u2019t handle the traffic the meme coins were bringing to the network so he had to do something to bring down the gas fees. He has since burned most of the Shiba tokens, so you have to ask yourself what would he have done with Akita? He would\u2019ve burned it as well wouldn\u2019t he? The only way I see this is you picked up a wallet with money and an ID card in it, the owner on the ID card is asking for his wallet back. But you already saw the money in the wallet and thought of all the million ways to spend it, even telling the owner that you would be able to spend his money better unless he can somehow convince you otherwise? At the end of the day we all make our own decisions, and we have to live with ourself afterwards. PS - I see there is only 104 comments so far, should I bring some of the Akita community over to state our case? Since they have been kept in the dark what you want to do with 50% of the tokens. ",

Second, a thought experiment: assume GitCoin does not get rid of these tokens and instead tries to stabliize or even maximize the value of the tokens because they want to use them as future funding. How many other new token will do the same thing in the future? None? One? Thousands? What happens to GitCoin when thousands of new tokens try to use it as a source of legitimacy? One thing: GitCoin\u2019s legitimacy goes to zero. Third: Getting rid of the tokens as if they were toxic waste is a metaphor. Are the tokens actually toxic waste? Who cares.

What many of our experience has been has been the ability to experience a pivot in action. Stated clearly, Akita was formed as a MEME coin, a shit coin if you will. Whoever made the coin, abandoned it somewhere down the line. As the story spread around forums and Telegram rooms, it became even less clear. The creator also apparently made a bone-headed decision to send half of the coins to Vitalik, creating the very unstable foundations where we stand today. HOWEVER, we as Akitans have seen many things beginning to brew, and I will say that our core is optimistic. We have seen some community members be drawn into active roles in the project. Self-funded. Without a definitive answer on what will be done with the donated Akita. The dev team provides consistent updates, and often asks for input from the community. Updates, even though they\u2019ve been subjected to a never-ending barrage of questions about the project on Telegram. And while this project may not yet be packaged up and marketed into what many at GitCoin would like to see right now,  that doesn\u2019t make it any less valuable. This is the value, it\u2019s the evolution of the project. What our community craves is certainty.

I think most of you havent even understood the first problem that comes to mind Dont look at the investors, screw them (me)\u2026 Whoever invests into a crypto / meme coin should know what he\u2019s getting into, at least most should. The price can go up, sideways or straight to hell and its a risk investors should be able to deal with on their own. But atleast do look at the people who got hurt by the initial roots of akita then took that dead project into their own hands, funded it themselves and made it public again, with decent success i might add (price wise) and even their path and vision of what AKITA wants to become is (for me) interessting and something to look forward to Secondly I understand that the Gitcoin Community doesnt owe AKITA anything, I understand that sending the 50% supply to Vitalik was a publicity stunt yet not one that relic and his team made, but also from my understanding its Gitcoins mission to help build / fund the open web like stated by Mr owocki, not destroying something thats in the making. Whats been given to you is essencially not Hard Cash to use but a crypto currency, now i dont think i have to explain how cashing these in like some members on the board suggested would impact Akita, im sure everyone in here is smarter than me. So infact whats been given to you is power over the work others have done so far, you may destroy it, set it back, help it or even leave it be but I really dont think funding projects you deem better justifies destroying / hindering a selfunded project and is not in line with Gitcoins mission at all Finally all said and done im not even here to suggest any solution, of course i would love to see the communities come together, work together and build together. But if i do it\u2019ll just be stamped as \u201coh hes just another investor afraid of losing his money or maximize his profits\u201d in most peoples mind and im not smart enough to even imagine how to do this If anything from a neutral standpoint, if you believe that the AKITA project is unworthy of funding/helping/working together or just another meme coin or whatever then just leave them be, but dont put the hammer on them and waste the work and money they put into the project just because you have a bag of money infront of your eyes. The most neutral suggestion i read here was from Mr.Tjayrush; Just send it back to Vitalik see what he does ,let AKITA fight it out again if he decides to send it to someone else or maybe he even burns them like we(AKITA) wish he would do. Gitcoins hands would be clean, reputation and ligitimacy intact, and everyone can just move On from this messy situation\u2026 After all Gitcoin has been doing just fine if not great even without the money they could gain from this donation ",

Relic happened to be there and instead of crying how unfair the world is he build a team with some if those people and rebuild AKITA into a mooning token within 4 months (wtf is there to not frikken respect pls, i am sry but i had to say it) Vitalik probably looked at the token, the price, the listings, the marketcap and amount of holders did a quick math thought about power over people he did not want and donated it (washed his hands)\u2026 If he knew the whole story i doubt we would be here debating, so rather than an accident you could say Vitalik send the donation to Gitcoin without fully knowing what happened with AKITA but trusting it was in good hands with Gitcoin I am not saying that it isnt seeing as veteran members and other members in this forum have been respectfull with their replies towards this issue, its just that when i see people like you and others (no offense meant) talk about not 100% selling everything at once since it doesnt maximize value, most efficient way of selling and internal selling scheme it makes me think a little wether it actually is,  seeing as you and others are still treating this as a bag of money ignoring anything related to it and quite frankly some comments in here sound like a bloodfest that everyone would enjoy and the public would benefit from Also i never said none of this will solve anything i only stated that i personally cannot bring anything informative to the table to make our communities work together, i did give an example of a neutral solution tho and the reasons as to why to reject the donation were also already mention by Mr.Tjayrush who originally proposed it so i dont have to repeat them i hope Sry i write much ",

Eliminating the battle of ideas because your ideas are bad. Please. Just step outside your position for two seconds and look at that. As has already been stated, sending tokens to VB for safekeeping was a commonplace attention-getting marketing strategy used by many of these dog meme coins, and others, at that point in time. All of these projects sent coins to VB for safekeeping - not one expecting the super-billionaire to touch them or rug his own communities. And not one of his actions yet has suggested that VB would ever purposefully do that. It is only you, and those like you, who are suggesting you do that with the coins VB sent your way.     JTraversa:  Please try to have a rational discussion   Is it rational for you to pretend these coins weren\u2019t sent to VB for safekeeping? You\u2019ve done it multiple times now. As if anyone is actually buying that! It amazes me how such self-proclaimed smart people can\u2019t see such a simple thing - but again, typical. Or would it be more rational for all of us to see that you are simply in a position to benefit from these coins, thus explaining your \u201cdifficulty\u201d grasping this simple concept, which has already been iterated to you through numerous comments, and proven to you via screenshots of the website itself? Wouldn\u2019t it also be rational for us to assume that had you been an Akita holder, you would be in quite a different position from where you are now, and would not want your investment plundered by others? It is rational to deduce that it is only because you are NOT in that position that you\u2019re cool with plundering Akita. And every word you have to say in justification of that action is just plain spin control. \u201c:the act or practice of attempting to manipulate the way an event is interpreted by others\u201d Pretending that these coins were ever meant to be spent by VB is a transparent and pathetic argument. No one actually believes this, besides the few of you with corruption in your hearts - those of you willing to destroy your brother for your own benefit. So even though you may believe your own BS, good luck getting anyone else to - and that\u2019s all that really matters for Gitcoin\u2019s future reputation, in this regard.     JTraversa:  the situation requires the Akita devs either propose something reasonable which provides values to both parties, or Gitcoin commit to a given sale scheme.   This has already been proposed.

There are many ways to provide perpetual funding through a protocol. It\u2019s the Akita devs job to try to bring an offer to the table.

Polarfox The DEX is not finished yet - we have been working on making an ETH / AVAX bridge over the past few weeks and have been making good progress in that. This bridge will allow people to send their AKITA over to AVAX and vice-versa. The next step after the bridge is to implement AKITA governance on the DEX. Two new tabs will be added to the Polarfox DEX:   AKITA Liquidity Mining: This tab will be similar to the already existing liquidity mining tab, and allow users to stake AKITA against AVAX and / or PFX to earn gAKITA tokens, which will be the AKITA governance token.  AKITA Governance: This tab will allow users to use their gAKITA tokens to vote on various proposals to determine the future of the AKITA community.  Doing it this way will allow us to bring some AKITA over to AVAX and have proper governance, all in the same platform as the Polarfox DEX. Another thing: the Polarfox PFX pre-sale will only be accessible to AKITA holders. As time goes on, we will add more use cases for the AKITA tokens.  DreamSwap DreamSwap is a different project, intended for the people who want to stay on Ethereum and for the people who are interested in other meme coins. As I am not a developer on DreamSwap, but only on Polarfox, I will not be able to give you as many details as for Polarfox. The DreamSwap exchange is going to be about staking AKITA against other dog and meme coins to earn DREAM, the native token of the platform.  Basically, you could say it this way: we want AKITA to emancipate from its \u201cmeme token\u201d status, while not forgetting its heritage, which we are not ashamed of. Polarfox represents this emancipation. It will give the project governance and make it part of a bigger, more \u201cprofessional\u201d ecosystem. DreamSwap, on the other hand, shows that we still like that heritage.  To answer your other questions / concerns:  The Akita token seems to not being used in the code.  This is correct as of now, but will change as we add new features.  You have the Akita contract in repo /Polarfox-DEX/polarfox-core/commit/5bf6f6c9fc697a618cad65ea37d952f9110aef6f but if you deploy this it would make new Akita token that you would control the entire mint balance of.  Correct. The reason we have it there is because we deployed it on the Ethereum test nets to properly test the bridge. We will also need its ABI later when making the AKITA governance. Since we already have experience making the PFX governance, this should not be an issue.  Why all these extra tokens?  Basically two extra tokens: one to control the Polarfox DEX, one to control DreamSwap. You are asking why, here are some reasons:  Funding: we have no funding at all so far, and only own little AKITA; Control: with no control whatsoever on the original token and with little supply, we\u2019re basically asked to drive a car with no arms. On top of this, the AKITA token does not support governance. The PFX token will be different; Give rewards on the long-term: having a large supply of PFX will allow us to very slowly and gradually offer it to investors in various ways. The governance will be used to validate or refute this use of the PFX token. Some PFX will go towards funding the AKITA project, which we would be completely unable to do without another token. Implement a deflationary mechanism: having our own token means we can implement new features, and a deflationary mechanism is one we have decided to implement.   What is the use for Akita here?  I think I answered this in my already long post, but if I have not, let me know.  Thank you for your interest and your time, and I am here if you need anything else / have any other questions. Have a nice evening / afternoon / morning / whatever  ",

                    "content": "Definitely surprising (in a good way) to see so much vigorous discussion on this happening over the last two weeks! I gave the coins to Gitcoin because I support their work in public goods funding and I think robust public goods funding institutions are something that the open source and crypto worlds really need more generally. There\u2019s a lot of good that could be done (for the Ethereum community, for the world at large, and for the AKITA community as well) out of having a large and sustainable long-term pool of funds being guaranteed for future public goods funding rounds. I think there are much better alternatives to just burning the coins, even for the AKITA community\u2019s interests! Cryptocurrency communities generally suffer from a severe lack of public goods funding, and so we regularly see multi-billion dollar projects languishing with 4-person development teams. So\u2026 why not just put the coins toward long-term funding of public goods? Here\u2019s an example simple proposal:  Put the coins into a Sablier contract that unlocks them over the course of some long period of time (eg. 20 years). When the coins come out, use them to fund quadratic funding rounds.  One possible split is 50% Ethereum-focused, 50% AKITA-focused. Another option is 40% Ethereum, 40% AKITA, 20% not-necessarily-crypto global public goods.    Having a large pool of coins in a dedicated public goods funding pool actually empowers a community much more than those coins being unavailable entirely; it ensures that there are resources to support ecosystem projects, execute on a roadmap, and do other things that ensure the ecosystem will continue to be very relevant for a long time. Putting them in a stream (could be Sablier or could be a dedicated contract), in the mean time, ensures that participants have confidence that nothing is going to get dumped quickly (a 20-year stream implies a 5% \u201cissuance\u201d rate during those two decades, equivalent to what DOGE has forever). The decision is definitely far out of my control at this point, but it would be amazing if long-term public goods funding can be considered as an option! ",

It does benefit both parties, and the fact that it will be given over 20 years will give AKITA a long-term vision, while allowing GitCoin to fund public goods without dumping the coin and hurting the community. Although I like Relic\u2019s proposal a bit more, I think your proposal is pretty damn good as well, for both parties. I\u2019d be very happy if this was voted, and I think GitCoin\u2019s team would be as well. Have a great day! ",

Two communities have been brought together, not in an arranged marriage per se, but a de facto collaboration that is a first of its kind in crypto history. This is quite something. As an investor in crypto since 2017, the AKITA Network was a project that was appealing at a time when pandemics, insurrections, and continued abuse of centralized power were culminating in a dark way. The token metrics alone were interesting, and for 10UNI, my investment was able to check off the box of trite, but fun things to say as a crypto investor - right after \u201cOwn 1 BTC (before flipping back to ETH)\u201d was \u201cOwn more than a billion tokens of SOMETHING\u201d. But why be billionaire of just anything? That\u2019s not interesting to me. The interesting thing with AKITA Network was the long term path to cross-chain exposure, taking a stab at a DeSoc platform, all while still maintaining an ETH origin. This was very appealing to me. It was easy to spot the gimmick that the original devs tried to capitalize upon before exiting, and it\u2019s a shame that they did so and didn\u2019t bother to take down the old website in their wake, as some of the BSC rugs have done so kindly lately. Its great to see that https://akita.network is now a functioning Web3 location for people looking to research AKITA Network before buying. The struggle to get CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to acknowledge our legitimacy has been an uphill battle, but they have (slowly) given way and changed their materials. I don\u2019t think I can put into words the level of respect and hopes I have for the AKITA Network - together we have built a very tight community over a few months, united in an effort to invest in a future set of projects, very clearly documented and discussed in their social channels. Veteran crypto investors are intersecting with newbies, explaining the Supremacy of DYOR & DD, and maybe even giving them a drink of the water they led them too, not just walking away.  Sir, think about what pump and dump means, and why do you want to be invested in such a project? You won\u2019t find that here, friend, but stick around and maybe we can convince you why hodling is just the beginning.  Relic\u2019s proposal is solid, and it gives good measure to the present and future of both communities. As an investor in crypto since 2017, I am very aware of how scarcity is extremely valuable, but legitimacy is ultimately the store of value. I appreciate that your proposal continues to acknowledge the future through an endowment, and that you also suggest grounding some of the benefit derived from this opportunity to public projects outside of the crypto space. This is true long-term, sustainable thinking. As an investor in crypto since 2017, I understand \u201cNot your keys, Not your coins.\u201d I really value that this opportunity for constructive discussion has invited other AKITA Network community members to choose action, and engage with this forum, in whatever way they choose to do so. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the result of the Gitcoin founders\u2019 decisions, and how AKITA Network and Gitcoin can amplify their respective networks to leverage more stability for decentralized public projects in the future. TL/DR: This is history in the making, so thank you for being (eventually) a willing participant who has taken the social experiment to a new level. ",

There\u2019s a curious symmetry here; VB was given the tokens without his knowledge, with the intention that it would create some kind of obligation on him to steward them in some fashion. He, ironically, has done effectively the same thing to GitCoin - albeit with more warning, and with suggestions rather than demands. If the GitCoin community decides they want to work with AKITA, great - but I don\u2019t think owning these funds creates an obligation to do so, and there are many other projects and communities that seem like better targets for such a collaboration.

                    "content": "Hi all, gitcoin user from 2018 here, getting back in involved because I think this is a very interesting problem. What to do here is quite the morally complex question, personally I view AKITA as at best vaporware and at worst a pure scam based on name memeablity. I think the community would be justified in not trying to monetize this transfer and instead sending it back to Vitalik. However, if our goal is to monetize it to support public good funding I think the current proposals are both complex to implement and inefficient in how much value is realized.  Directly selling will realize at most a few percent of the market cap and any proposal to do this which are not just dumping on uniswap require high admin costs and complex implementations. Distributing the coins along side grants also has complex admin and ties the reputations of the projects together in a way that I think is unpalatable for gitcoin. Holding the coins and trying to improve the value of the AKITA ecosystem requires the gitcoin community to coordinate around ways to improve a project which is far outside our core competency and imo distracts from our mission and the things we\u2019d all rather be doing.  The simplest proposal to implement which will also maximize the economic value the gitcoin community is able to realize from the gift is to create a GTC staking contract which allows GTC holders to receive a share of the AKITA over a fixed timeframe of say 2-5 years. This will cause is people to GTC in secondary markets in order to be able to attain high staking rates paid in AKITA, because of the relative liquidity in crypto markets this buy presure will translate fairly efficiently into higher GTC market cap. A staking arrangement like this is a way of turning the value of AKITA into market cap of GTC in a reasonably efficient way. Given that the GTC dao is already highly likely to use its 50% allocation of GTC to fund public goods this mechanism that extra value means that each grant will be more valuable with no additional overhead. Comparing economic outcomes:  Assume we are able to sell the AKITA for and attain all of the liquidity in uniswap the DAO receives ~5 million in stable value which can be used for grants. At current market rates ~$7 per GTC, this increases the value which the DAO can pay in grants by about 1.4%. Assume instead that we distribute the 150 million in value to GTC stakers over 5 years at an APY rate of 50%, this will generate a buy or locking pressure for GTC of ~40 million dollars. At current market prices of $7 ie ~65 million in market cap, the staking pressure is likely to produce very conservatively minimum of a 10% increase in price and a 10% increase in the value of each grant given in GTC.  The primary downside of this mechanism is that it\u2019s sensitive to bear markets since it\u2019s unclear how  AKITA value will hold up in those conditions. Given this my proposal for max economic gain/ stable grant funding but disregarding simplicity would be to do both a sale over the course of several months to try to receive at least several million in stable coins for a small portion of the 150 million dollar value we currently hold and a staking program for the large majority of it. Also to put my money/time where my mouth is, I\u2019m a smart contract engineer with a long track record off an on gitcoin and I believe a staking contract is small and simple enough, so I\u2019m willing to write it for free if the community goes this route.

Akita devs could be the ones to organize the hackathon to help  their project out of a the meme get rich quick scheme (that\u2019s how it started) then funding  the project could go around public goods projects that serve every community not only Akita\u2019s, this way we could welcome hackers from the Akita community to the Quadratic lands. I don\u2019t think the Akita community should be dismissed, but if the Akita community is selling themselves as a community  with a plan, why not build it like any other project? and not just by tapping into people trying to get in at an \u201cearly Doge\u201d. In this Hackathon some of the tokens can be given as prizes, some can be donated to grants, some could be burned, some could be sold for a purpose. It\u2019s up to Akita to show their willingness to cooperate insto building something useful and not the other way around. Show us you are not just greedy people using your community for a profit, bring them on and BUIDL. I by no means want to rug dump onto a huge amount of people living a dream they were sold, I would wish they could come and build that dream. ",
