The overall goals are as follows:  Provide an index of relevant pages that can explain parameters as they are modified in signal requests and votes. Help governance participants understand how to intentionally govern the Maker Protocol. Intentionally meaning knowing how to achieve desired goals with the tools and levers available. Provide durable access to information regarding how Maker Governance has dealt with various environments and situations in the past, such that it can inform future decision-making. Provide information on how the Maker Protocol works at a detailed (but non-technical) level.  With this in mind, are there any resources that you (as a participant in Maker Governance) wish were present in this documentation source? So far we\u2019re certain we want the following:  A comprehensive index of governance parameters with plain-English descriptions and considerations to take when considering changes. A comprehensive index of in-use protocol modules with plain-English descriptions and explanations of how they operate, who can operate them, etc. Instructions on how to audit executive spells. Instructions on how to verify poll and executive hashes. Links and descriptions of the commonly relied-upon frontend UI\u2019s that show the status of the protocol.  Past that, things are still a little up in the air. So, what would you like to see as part of these resources beyond the above? ",
