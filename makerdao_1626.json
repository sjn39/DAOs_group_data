My initial idea was to highlight @LongForWisdom\u2019s \u201cGovernance at a glance\u201d thread here but also try to get MKR holders more involved/updated in other ways which I still haven\u2019t figured out yet. In short, open to all ideas. ",

If it drives more interested parties to the forum, that would be a win. As for other ideas, can we set it up so that it tweets when there are new polls and executive votes? We should probably set the expectation early that the account be neutral towards rate changes and polls generally. We should use it to bring people\u2019s attention to governance but not to advocate for one specific agenda over another, at least in my view. ",

Then, everything else can be manually tweeted (like referencing relevant Forum threads and discussions that are going on). Thoughts? ",
