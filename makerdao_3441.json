Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP10 adds the budget for Core Unit SES-001: Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. It contains:  Total Budget Cap: the hard limit voted by Governance Breakdown of Permanent Team for the expected first payment (June) The breadowns for the Incubation and Grant programs The MKR Compensation Expectation   Specification  Motivation Going by the critical nature of the work done by the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit, sufficient funds need to be provisioned in order to guarantee the success of the Maker ecosystem in the long run. The proposed budget comprises three parts:  Permanent Team Budget The Permanent Team Budget is covering salaries and operational costs for the permanent team members of the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. This is a standard budget based on the breakdown of actual costs. It will evolve over time in a relatively slow and predictable way.  Incubator Program Budget The Incubator Program Budget is not based on a breakdown of actual costs, but rather acts as a spending limit for a financial buffer that will be used for funding incubation projects at the discretion of the SES Facilitator and multisig co-signers.  3 months no support2220\u00d7390 70.4 KB  A big part of the Incubator Program\u2019s value lies in this ability to quickly allocate budgets without having to wait for governance approval. This is to avoid a situation where promising teams have to wait in great uncertainty, typically 3 months or longer, before potentially receiving the first DAO payment for their Core Unit. This is seen as a requirement that is an unreasonable barrier to entry for new teams joining the ecosystem.  Grants Program Budget The Grants Program Budget is a similar budget based on prior experience with the Governance Communications\u2019 grants program that has now been sunset.  Core Unit ID SES-01  Budget Cap Breakdown  Dai Expenditure Total Budget Cap We\u2019re asking for a Total Budget Cap of $1,153,480, spanning a 3-month runway.     Group Monthly Total 3 Months     Permanent Team $154,493 $463,480   Incubation $200,000 $600,000   Grants $30,000 $90,000   Grand Total $384,493 $1,153,480    Permanent Team Budget Cap     Type Monthly Total     Salaries  (9.23 FTEs) $120,083   New hires\u2019 Salaries (2 FTEs) $19,708   Buffer $8,333   Software Development $4,167   Software $1,785   Gas $417   Grand Total $154,493    See our Team Spreadsheet for more details about the included FTEs. Incubation Program Budget Cap The limit for the Incubation Program was estimated based on a number of team configuration scenarios that we want to support, as outlined in the table below. The requested limit is the (rounded) maximum amount needed for any of these scenarios.      Teams Avg Team Size People Total Avg Salary Annual Cost Monthly Cost     Sr. Engineers 3 4 12 $155,000 $1,860,000 $155,000   Non-technical 5 4 20 $120,000 $2,400,000 $200,000   Mix 3 6 18 $137,500 $2,475,000 $206,250    Estimations of different incubation costs at industry standards. Grants Program Budget Cap The details for the Grants Program are still being worked out. To avoid having to update the budget MIP soon, a budget is included that will be sufficient to get the program up and running. Once the program is active, more detailed estimates will be included in the Monthly Budget Statement.  MKR Expenditure Permanent Team For the Permanent Team, a budget proposal amendment will be submitted that proposes a detailed MKR incentive model. While this leaves the details undefined for now, the expectation of the team is threefold:  That the MKR incentive structure is reasonably defined by the time the team starts working for the SES Core Unit. That the vesting schedule starts no later than this starting date. That the commitment and therefore risk that the team is taking will be reflected in this structure, for example by taking the MKR price into account at the moment of the formal submission of this MIP40c3-SP10.  Incubation Program For the Incubation Teams, MKR incentives will be included in the respective budget MIPs as they are published. This may include a back pay amount for the incubation time, but these details too, are still being discussed.  Budget Implementation  Goals The budget implementation is based on a monthly reporting and top-up cycle that is described in the sections below. Our goals with this implementation are the following:  Continuously fund the SES core unit. Ensuring that SES has enough money available for business continuity and minimal job security. Provide full transparency and be kept in check by a group of governance-appointed auditors. Fully separate cashflows on the Core Unit and budget category level for transparency. Reduce governance overhead to a minimum.   Wallet Top Up Mechanism1440\u00d7810 61.3 KB   Total Budget Cap The Total Budget Cap, specified in the Budget Cap Breakdown, will be transferred to the Auditors Wallet, who will keep the funds and transfer them as needed. This amount aims to maintain a 3-month runway for the Core Unit. The Auditors Wallet balance will never exceed the upper limit voted by Governance. If this limit needs to be raised, or we\u2019re no longer expecting to ever need it, an additional subproposal MIP will be submitted to adjust it.  Multi-sig Wallets The budget is split up in three separate categories: Permanent Team, Grants Program, and Incubation Program. The following multi-sigs are involved:   The Auditors Wallet \u2013 A 3-out-of-4 multi-sig, controlled by trusted Maker DAO members that are not a member of SES. This multi-sig will hold the Total Budget Cap in DAI. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the operational wallets. One of the signers is the Self-Accountability Auditor of the SES Core Unit. The signers of the Auditors Wallet are still being confirmed and will be added to the MIP40c3-SP10 forum thread. No funds will be sent to this wallet before the signers\u2019 addresses have been set in the wallet.   The Operational Wallets \u2013 One wallet for each budget category. These are 2-out-of-3 multi-sigs controlled by SES. Signers include the facilitator, the team lead, and one other SES member from the permanent team, responsible for the associated budget category.  The Permanent Team Wallet  The Grants Program Wallet  The Incubation Program Wallet      Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, SES will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:   The Budget Forecast, based on the latest available information, of the budget (in DAI) that is required to maintain a 3 month runway for the team.  The Last Month Actuals, i.e. the actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  The MKR Vesting Overview \u2013 this is a schedule that has the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  The Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount for each Operational Wallet to replenish the 3 month runway Any excess DAI amount that will be returned to the Auditors Wallet    The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found in this git repository on Github.  Monthly Top-up Cycle  Seeding the Auditors Wallet As preparation for the Monthly Top-up Cycle, the Auditors Wallet first needs to be seeded with the Total Budget Cap from the surplus buffer. This seeding transaction will be included in the executive vote on the initial SES Core Unit MIPs.  Monthly Cylce   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first 5 days of the month, SES submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditors Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.   Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, SES submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:   DAI Top-up Transactions \u2013 One DAI transaction for each Operational Wallet that has a balance below the 3-month runway forecast. The top-up transaction adds enough funds to the operational wallet to replenish this runway.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 SES creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to governance:   Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-month runway forecast.    Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditors Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. They check that the transaction request amounts are the ones mentioned in the report and that they make sense. If there are any irregularities or other questions or comments, they discuss this with SES and allow for resubmission if any corrections are required.   Transaction Approvals \u2013 Three of the Auditors Wallet signers sign the submitted transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallets. SES can now use the funds for expenses.   Auditors Wallet Top-up \u2013 In the next executive vote, SES submits a PR to top up the Auditors Wallet to the Total Budget Cap. The cycle can now start again from step 1.

In an ideal world the MIP / Subproposal is content complete for the start of the RFC period, and any changes are in response to feedback. In practice deadlines have been tight, and often authors have used the RFC period to make tweaks or to add polish or clarifications. This has generally been fine. What we haven\u2019t really seen before is authors adding non-trivial new content just before the freeze period begins. The reason this is problematic is because it leaves zero time for any edits to be made based on feedback from the community (which implies that the author doesn\u2019t actually intend to accept any feedback from other parties at all.) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to accept this MIP into the May cycle given the above. It sets a bad precedent: That it\u2019s okay to add additional logic / content at the eleventh hour such that there is no time for feedback. It\u2019s especially problematic in this case given that the minting of MKR has been a heavily debated issue. Are you willing to delay til June to allow for feedback on this? If not, are you willing to separate the MKR incentive portion into its own budget proposal?  On top of the actual process issues, I don\u2019t feel that the section on MKR Expenditure actually provides enough clarity on the planned expenditure. Are the amounts shown by vesting dates per FTE or in total? What is the total amount of MKR minted per year? What is the methodology, how is this split between employees, etc? ",

The reference to guidelines here isn\u2019t super specific, nor does it go into detail over the relevant circumstances under which the Governance Facilitator should not allow MIPS to move forwards. But there is clearly some discretion here on behalf of the Governance Facilitator. MIP0 says the following on RFC:   3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below:  MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase.    Strictly speaking, the subproposal follows the transition criteria defined in MIP0 (though the reference to changes based on community feedback is perhaps ambiguous here), so it\u2019s certainly not an obvious decision on my part. There is nothing I can point to that says \u2018you are breaking this rule, and therefore I have justification to prevent it from moving forwards.\u2019 That said, I\u2019ll repeat what I said earlier. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s taking the RFC period in the spirit that it was intended and I think if others take similar actions in the future, it would have a negative affect on the process. I would be uncomfortable forcing a delay on this given the somewhat sketchy justification. However, regardless of whether or not you do end up delaying, I do intend to put up an amendment to MIP0 that makes this situation more clear and would provide that justification in future situations on this sort. I\u2019d love to get some input from @charlesstlouis and / or @Davidutro on this. ",

                    "content": " About the Process  Is the MIP Process Broken? We were allowing one whole week before the Formal Submission. We have followed the MIP process and its deadlines. We were under the impression that the Freeze Period (and its deadline) ensures no one changes something before it goes into voting. Yet, the feedback received suggests that SES shouldn\u2019t include this MIP in the next cycle because we are not allowing enough time. There\u2019s still one week of RFC where we could receive feedback (granted, not modify anything based on it). We could, however, decide to make the Formal Submission or not based on that feedback.  If being too close to the deadline is a no-go, maybe we should move the deadline (or make it more precise).   About the Proposal  Good Intentions We indeed had this framework prepared when we published the subproposal. We did not want to post it to avoid swaying the MKR Compensation Working Group (in a way or another). We honestly presumed that some framework would be drafted by now (at least in an early form).  Future-Proof MKR Compensation Framework Our MKR Compensation Proposal is based on the 180-day price average of MKR\u2019s price (we want to use this Framework when MKR is $40,000 as well as $400,000). We held it for three weeks and ended reviewing our MKR proposal down (because the price of MKR went up). I don\u2019t think anyone is thrilled about waiting any longer.  Less Contentious? Arguably, our MKR Compensation Plan is less aggressive than the one proposed by Protocol Engineering. We\u2019re proposing, on average, about a third of the MKR per FTE, compared the Protocol Engineering\u2019s proposal.  Critical for our Team Many people in SES will not go ahead without the MKR Compensation within the Compensation Package. We hold that this (similarly to the Dai Compensation) is vital for the team\u2019s development. I cannot stress this point enough.  Next Steps That said, we don\u2019t want to alienate you (or anyone in Governance) and show goodwill on our side:  We will split the MKR Compensation Implementation Budget from the Dai Compensation Budget. Since this is a \u201cnew\u201d Budget Implementation (more from a technical than a practical point of view) it will fall into the next cycle. We will review it and publish it before the deadline. We will lock the amount of MKR to the price already calculated in our proposal. We think this is a good compromise.  ",

Personally, I just don\u2019t like this idea of locking in a price. The price is so volatile, why would you tie rewards to it? It will incentivize CUs to propose themselves before they are ready just to lock in a favorable/low price. Or the opposite, CUs may decide to wait a month in anticipation a lower MKR price. Or in general, it just creates a weird variable that has a huge long-term effect on the amount of USD$ denominated compensation one receives and is based almost fully on luck. I imagine we want CUs that begin in the same time range to have similar locked prices if the DAO decided to use this model for everyone. An alternative approach could be to do what PE did in their budget proposal and allocate based on % of total supply. Besides not relying on price, this would give the advantage of having a less volatile reference point and common standard for everyone to measure themselves against.  image744\u00d7502 17.1 KB  If a full time engineer is getting 0.1%, perhaps a full time member of SES gets the same 0.1% or 0.075% if that\u2019s what\u2019s decided.

According to @longforwisdom the WG plans on posting some guidance documentation in May for starters, but at minimum, that framework will also need to go into 2 month (RFC / Vote). Another thing to try to balance this is that the RWF has been working on a budget framework that will allow the DAO to see operational burn / runway as well as tie into MKR valuation. @Aes is working on the budget and already in the MKR Compensation WG.

No funds will be sent to this wallet before the signers\u2019 addresses have been set in the wallet.    Auditors Wallet Signers In the meantime, we have confirmed with a number of trusted Maker DAO members that they will be taking up the role of Auditors Wallet signers. The confirmed signers are:   @SebVentures (RWF Core Unit) who is also our self-accountability auditor. Address: 0x0D61C8b6CA9669A36F351De3AE335e9689dd9C5b   @prose11 (GovAlpha Core Unit) Address: 0xf3ED2bdeBa77940E6759B806cd55CE20cAE369BE   @Aaron_Bartsch (trusted community member) Address: 0x30f7A5441eBdB77dD741ea52923ed5033d63aC07   @hexonaut (Protocol Engineering Core Unit) Address: bellwoodstudios.eth (0x18CaE82909C31b60Fe0A9656D76406345C9cb9FB)    Auditor Responsibilities The auditors are tasked with (1) reviewing the monthly budget statements that we will submit to them together with the requests for payment, (2) asking questions or providing feedback in case anything is unclear or out of order, and ultimately (3) sign the multisig payment transactions to top up our operational wallets once everything is correct. Should there be any issue with the payment request that does not get resolved, the auditors will block the payment for the time being, and can escalate the matter to bring it to the attention of the governance community. As such, the process does not depend on the bandwidth of the governance community as a group, making it more scalable than the assumption that for example MKR holders will check everything themselves.  Total Budget Cap There is one important aspect we need to highlight in absence of a production-ready keg module: the current process relies on the auditing process to keep the budget within its Total Budget Cap. This is because it is flexible enough to top up the operational wallets with up to 3 months worth of expenses to replenish the runway. While this is very useful to cover exceptional circumstances such as front-loaded or unforeseen temporary expenses, clearly this flexibility must not be used to exceed the budget cap. We will additionally highlight the Total Budget Spent in the monthly budget statements so that it can be readily checked by the auditors. Once the keg module can be used in production, we will submit a proposal to put it as a guard between the surplus buffer and the Auditor Wallet so that this check is enforced on the smart contracts level.  Thank you! I\u2019d like to extend our sincere gratitude to the Auditor Wallet signers in this list, for the responsibility that they\u2019re willing to take up. We believe that the practice of a monthly budget statement review will greatly contribute to the improved transparency and scrutiny of the expenses of the Maker Protocol\u2019s funds, by SES and hopefully by the other core units in the future. Big thank you for that!  @SebVentures, @Aaron_Bartsch, @prose11, @hexonaut: if you could double-check the address and confirm in this thread, that would be greatly appreciated. I\u2019ll be waiting for this confirmation to add the addresses to the wallet. ",
