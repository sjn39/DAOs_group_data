                    "content": "With the recent adoption of the liquidations 2.0 framework, as well as recent price volatility and gas price spikes, it is worth reevaluating our current dust parameters. To review, dust is the minimum permitted debt for a vault - you can learn more in the documentation here. Users must borrow at least this amount to open a vault, and cannot repay their debt below this amount unless they pay off the entire remaining balance. Higher dust values make vaults less accessible for smaller users, but also protect Maker from risk of vaults being too small to liquidate profitably.  Market conditions This table (updated for liquidations 2.0 changes) shows the transaction costs in DAI for liquidation based on ETH and gas price, and also shows the minimum debt (dust) tolerated for auctions to clear successfully without a loss to Maker.  823\u00d7502 72.8 KB  Source: gasnow.org In the market volatility of the past week, we\u2019ve seen cases of gas prices rising to over 1,200 gwei for sustained periods, with spikes as high as 2,000 gwei. If we want to be hedged/protected in cases where gas prices spike to 1,500 gwei, and market price of assets is 15% below vaults\u2019 liquidation price (through a combination of price falls or liquidator profit margin), we\u2019d need to set a minimum dust value of around 10,000 DAI for vaults with 150% collateral ratio.  696\u00d7372 51.8 KB  The ETH-C vault type has a higher collateral ratio, and therefore larger safety buffer for liquidations. So we could accommodate for a similar gas price spike and price discount with only 5,000 DAI dust limit.  849\u00d7370 60.6 KB  Many of our small capitalization assets require a minimum 175% collateral ratio, but they are considerably more volatile than Ether. We may want to accommodate for larger potential drawdowns and lower liquidity in these assets by requiring a larger dust value vs the ETH-C vault. A dust value of 10,000 DAI would accommodate a 25% drawdown.  849\u00d7370 60.6 KB  The ETH-B vault type uses a lower liquidation ratio, which gives Maker comparatively less margin of safety for liquidations versus other vaults. The same hypothetical 1,500 gwei gas spike and 15% price drawdown would require a 25-30,000 DAI dust value to maintain liquidator profitability without causing Maker losses.  Based on the liquidation ratios and price behaviour of our supported assets, we can roughly group them in 3 categories for dust parameter: ETH-B, ETH-C, and all other assets. Generally we\u2019d want to set the highest dust value of ETH-B, an intermediate value for most vault types, and the lowest value for ETH-C. But the community can decide its preference of how large of a gas price spike or price drawdown we\u2019d like to be protected against.  Impact on users: Taking the ETH-A vault type as an example, out of a total 2,803 vaults with over 200 DAI debt, there are 462 ETH-A vault positions below the current 5,000 DAI dust limit. Increasing the dust limit to 10,000 DAI would impact an additional 403 vault positions. Other vault types have much fewer users, but in percent terms a similar proportion of small balance vaults would be impacted. For borrowers using ETH collateral, they may be able to use the ETH-C vault type if Maker community decides to maintain a relatively lower dust limit. Maker could also implement other creative solutions to help reduce reliance on the dust parameter, such as an alternative vault type with higher liquidation ratio or requiring a security deposit from vault owners similar to Liquity, but these reduce accessibility similarly to high dust limits.  Signal request polls: Please select all options you would support in an on chain poll (multiple choice) What should be the dust value for the ETH-B vault type?     15,000 DAI (no change) 20,000 DAI 25,000 DAI 30,000 DAI Abstain     0 voters     What should be the dust value for the ETH-C vault type?     5,000 DAI (no change) 7,500 DAI 10,000 DAI Abstain     0 voters     What should be the dust value for all other vault types (excluding ETH-B and ETH-C)?     5,000 DAI (no change) 7,500 DAI 10,000 DAI 15,000 DAI Abstain     0 voters      Next steps: This poll will close on Tuesday, June 8. I\u2019ll submit for an on-chain poll if a majority of forum voters support changing the dust parameter for at least one of the vault type groupings above. ",
