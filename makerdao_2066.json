The proposed funding will finance development of an information portal with good search capabilities and \u2014ideally\u2014 decentralized storage.  Reason Details The funding will be for the winner of a JokeDAO contest to implement the best proposed solution for an Endgame information portal. The reward is 9,999 DAI. The underlying voting tokens have already been distributed to MKR holders, delegates, and CU members for the last JokeDAO contest. The JokeDAO entrants should submit a proposal containing:  The title of their proposed solution. What the solution would look like (sketches, MVPs, or previous work encouraged). How they\u2019d implement their proposed solution (e.g., technical architecture or no-code platforms). A timeframe, milestones if needed, and the due date for delivery.  There are three steps:  Passing this Maker native proposal, the JokeDAO entry submissions, and the voting (on JokeDAO).  If this proposal passes, the solution race will last for two weeks after the ratification of this proposal. Finding a winner during voting will last for one week. The winner will get paid 9,999 DAI to implement the solution. Payout will be done by the JokeDAO smart contracts via the rewards feature. We propose paying out 1k immediately after the winner is elected and 8,999 DAI after successfully completing the proposal to safeguard funds. JokeDAO is working with the authors to find a solution to automate these payouts as much as possible.  DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis The proposed transfer is within the parameters of the Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI).  Targets The recipient is the smart contract for the JokeDAO contest. The address is TBA. Recipient Address: TBA Amount To Transfer: 9,999 DAI  ",

This proposal uses JokeDAO to host a contest. Contestants will propose solutions to design the user interface and backend of a portal that would host Endgame-related information. The winning entry would be awarded 9,999 DAI to create the proposed portal. This fee is only to create the portal and does not include any content. As per MIP14c2, transfers under 10,000 DAI have no Feedback Period or Frozen Period. If this subproposal is ratified, the contest will last for two weeks and voting will last a further one week. The winner will get paid 1,000 DAI immediately and a further 8,999 DAI after they implement their solution. MKR holders, CU members and Recognized Delegates have already been airdropped voting tokens that they may use for this competition. This proposal has been assigned Medium-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth. You remain responsible for any actions you take on the grounds of this information. Please note the date when the summary was last updated to judge accuracy. Updated 2023-01-14 ",

For comparison, the Manual has taken many hours of work, including quality control and review time, and Endgame is an order of magnitude more complex.     Davidutro:  My alternative suggestion is to build it into the Maker Operational Manual   IMO it should not be added to the MOM as that detracts from the MOM\u2019s role as a resource for Governance participants. However, GovAlpha and SES are collaborating on providing some Endgame documentation which will be added to the overview list in the MOM here:  This is very much in the preliminary phase but we hope to have the first few entries live this month.
