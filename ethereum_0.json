                    "content": " eip: 5252 title: Account-bound Finance description: An EIP-5114 extension to remove insolvency and arbitrary loss of funds author: Hyungsuk Kang (@hskang9) status: Draft type: Standards Track category: ERC created: 2022-06-29 requires: 721, 1155, 5114   Abstract This EIP proposes a form of smart contract design pattern and a new type of account abstraction on how one\u2019s finance should be managed in web3.0, ensuring transparency of managing investments and protection with self-sovereignty even from its financial operators. This EIP also extends EIP-5114, but the difference is that it can be transferred to other accounts for mobility between managing multiple wallets.  Motivation Finance in the crypto ecosystem is facing a huge trust issue. Smart contracts are often proxies, with the actual logic of the contract hidden away in a separate logic contract. Many projects include a multi-signature \u201cwallet\u201d with unnecessarily-powerful permissions. And it is not possible to independently verify that stablecoins have enough real-world assets to continue maintaining their peg, creating a large loss of funds (such as happened in the official bankruptcy announcement of Celsius and UST de-pegging and anchor protocol failure). One should not trust exchanges or other third parties with one\u2019s own investments. The pattern empowers more self-sovereignty and gives more credentials(obviously with an Account-bound token) than locking financial data in the operating team\u2019s contract. Segregation between investor\u2019s fund and operation fee is clearly specified in the smart contract, so investors can ensure safety from arbitrary loss of funds by the operating team\u2019s control.  Specification The pattern consists of 5 components, manager, factory, finance, account-bound token, and extension.  Diagram  Fig 1 - Component Diagram of EIP-5252 Manager: Manager contract acts as an entry point to interact with the investor. The contract also stores parameters for Finance contract. Factory: Factory contract manages contract bytecode to create for managing investor\u2019s fund and clones Finance contract on Manager contract\u2019s approval. It also mints account-bound tokens to interact with the Finance contract. Finance: Finance contract specifies all rules on managing an investor\u2019s fund. The contract is only accessible with an account that has an Account-bound token. When an investor deposits a fund to Manager contract, the contract sends the fund to Finance contract account after separating fees for operation. Account-bound token: Account-bound token contract in this EIP can bring the Finance contract\u2019s data and add metadata. For example, if there is a money market lending Finance contract, its Account-bound token can show how much balance is in agreement using SVG. Extension: Extension contract is another contract that can utilize locked funds in Finance contract. The contract can access with Finance contract on operator\u2019s approval managed in Manager contract.  Backwards Compatibility This EIP has no known backward compatibility issues.
