The community is discussing incentives to get more users on Uniswap, the latest version could go live at any moment, making the incentives obsolete. Any rough estimate on the progress could significantly improve our decision-making on several topics. ",

I agree with you, and hope the team will provide more detailed insights in what to expect for V3 (and when to expect V3). I\u2019m sure the team will keep everyone informed at their own pace and doesn\u2019t want to release information before having everything ready / confirmed. We\u2019ll find out. I do want to point out that governance is meant for: \u2018\u2018Uniswap has always embraced the tenets of neutrality and trust minimization : it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary\u2019\u2019. So that said, let\u2019s wait and see what things look like. And, we\u2019ll then figure out what changes the community wants to see through governance. ",
