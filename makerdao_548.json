We are discussing with PECU and other CUs our multichain strategy (L2 Stakeholder Alignment Meeting) by coordinating efforts, detailing the plan, and setting milestones. Our focus is on Dai integrations at the current stage, but as we go along the multichain roadmap, we will be concentrating our efforts on any of these three initiatives.   Liquidity: Some partners are working with us to help us in the process of bootstrapping DAI liquidity in L2s. We are working with ImToken in a campaign to give their users DAI prizes in Arbitrum, and working with wallets like Argent and Dexs like DiversiFi to increase Dai usage in zkSync and StarkEx. Of course, we know that\u2019s not enough, and that\u2019s why we are discussing how to improve DAI liquidity in these L2s, although we are considering MMs, we are also thinking about having in-house solutions.   Ecosystem: We are looking for partners who can offer these services to DAI users:    Get Dai Save your Dai Spend your Dai Bridge your Dai The growth of our ecosystem is highly tied to Dai liquidity, although some of our partners integrate Dai without caring about its liquidity, others are looking for Dai to increase its liquidity before using it.   Announcements, by using our partner\u2019s marketing teams.   Content for our partners.  As part of our mission of finding new and qualified leads for RWAs, BanklessDAO with the collaboration of Growth and @Real-World-Finance  created two articles that help us explain the Maker\u2019s RWA strategy to institutions.

In the last two weeks, we shared incredible moments with the MakerFam, starting in Mexico, during Growth\u2019s offsite: reviewing previous year\u2019s results and structuring this year\u2019s plan. During EthDenver we had meetings with current and potential partners like Solace, NFTX, Skynet, Numio, Livepeer, 3AC, Lemoncash, Polygon, DefiSaver, TrueFi, Cryptex, and others. We also spent time with web2 people, as they want to learn more about Maker (and how to integrate their business with us or work for us), and we went to a dinner hosted by Google, as they are trying to understand what\u2019s happening in web3. We also had internal meetings with Oasis and PECU to talk about IV, and with @Davidutro we organized a dinner between Mandated Actors and Delegates, where we discussed all of the cross-CU initiatives. I presented Growth\u2019s CU vision and strategy in EthDenver. Here are the slides and the presentation, in case you are curious. And between Growth, PECU, Oracles, StrategicHappines, and Oasis we throw the most epic party: Daivinity!  twitter.com    DAIvinity @DaIvinity  Here's a little recap of@DAIvinity@ChurchNightClub from@EthereumDenver last week. Was wonderful to see you all. Keep an eye out here for details on our nxt event!@MakerDAO https://t.co/45Oldu6pAT         1:56 PM - 26 Feb 2022           22                2             IV. We are working with Nexo, Oasis, Fireblocks, and PECU to develop the IV product. Oasis will we creating the interface for Nexo to access its IV. As they use Fireblocks, this integration has to include it.  D3M. First step to add D3M to the AaveArc Market is to get Dai approved: Snapshot  Next Events.  EthRio (March 11th): we are planning a side event with a partner from LatAm EthDubai (March 29th): we are planning a side event with Polygon    Star of the week.   GMO: DAI and MKR are listed on a Japanese exchange. This is the first one in Japan, after four years of work in Japan, explaining to regulators and exchanges about MakerDAO, we got the approval to be listed in Japanese exchanges. Awesome job @Kathleen @joce_chang  MakerDAO twitter Account. Twitter followers: 199.3K Number of tweets: 7 Twitter engagement rate: 1.1%  It\u2019s not a good number, but we just started the Twitter journey. This is part of our plan to rais the engagement rate:   Activate content strategy with some weekly threads about Maker community updates, hoping this will raise all numbers. We\u2019re going to publish our first thread about Core Units the current week.   Closed a deal with a design agency for Twitter pieces, such as videos, infographics, and banners. The goal is to have more visual posts, and we expect the visuals will give us more attention from our audience.   ",
