Given the current uncertainties surrounding the tax parameter and its implications on emergency shutdown, I think it would be a good idea to keep a tighter spread between the Sai supply and its debt ceiling. Until we can fully understand the ramifications of the unpaid stability fees, the ~20 million of unused cap space is likely too much and opens up the community to unnecessary risk. The Interim Risk Team is proposing a reduction of the Sai debt ceiling to 30 million, with a plan for further adjustments to be roughly 5 million above the current Sai supply. If for any reason the Sai supply begins to grow again, the community can vote to increase the debt ceiling. ",

Adjustment to 30 could be short a little in the context of a new potential investor or a fast grow of some new shareholders. That would lead to a new premature vote but this is still safe i think. Giving a total of 3.5 millions in difference is fine i guess. Maybe a vote with 30 and 35 and will see the results ? ",
