Perhaps there would be different parameters surrounding these types of deposits (i.e. length of loan time and which Stocks, commodities would be accepted, etc.).  Or not\u2026 MakerBroker would internally manage these loan holdings during the duration of the loan. ",

From my understanding, since the GFC, securities-based lending has been a strong area of growth for Investment Banks. This has been facilitated by extremely low-interest rates and rising asset prices. Traditionally, securities-based lending has mainly been available to the ultra-wealthy, but it would be interesting if Maker and MakerBroker marketed towards a broader (and more inclusive) market. If this is where you\u2019re going, this could be an excellent way to achieve one of The Foundation\u2019s Core Principles of Serving the Underserved. I\u2019m trying to make sure I fully understand your proposal, so please bear with me if I do not understand your proposal. ",
