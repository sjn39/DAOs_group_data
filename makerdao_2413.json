Increasing debt ceilings with no compensation for risk is not something that should be so automatic, though, especially with the unquantifiable aspect of the counterparty risk. When rates normalize, we will find the true demand for WBTC vault, and I think from there we can select a more appropriate debt ceiling. My personal opinion is that uncompensated risk should stay confined to ETH because at the very least we don\u2019t have to reason about counterparty risk there for now. ",

I wanted to highlight that it\u2019s very important to raise the debt ceiling to maintain the use case avenue open for retail users. There has been a tremendous amount of effort from various projects in the space to educate the retail user base on this use case and that effort would be halted if the debt ceiling is reached. This could be a very gradual but consistent increase in the ceiling that\u2019s mitigated with fee increase. The risk team could have a look at the amount of WBTC that has been minted since beginning of May that did not end up locked in Maker. This could be a light indicator on increased liquidity around the market. The other factor to consider is the new integrations that make the market more efficient for Maker such as, wbtc.cafe and the renBTC<>wBTC pool on Curve. ",
