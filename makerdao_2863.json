Discussion on Uniswap liquidity pooling as a potential tool Governance       There has been some discussion in the past around the protocol minting dai and buying up assets on the open market like usdc and eth. Both of these asset types have disadvantages. Ethereum still is incredibly volatile and so is not a secure reserve currency. Usdc is stable, but is under regulatory and custodial jurisdiction. Neither of these tokens produce any yield.  We have also had some discussions about increasing dai reserves held by the protocol to allow us to sell dai on the market later \u2026     I think the current idea is that if/when a strategic reserve is created for dai these liquidity pools tokens stand as a probable asset that the maker community would be interested in holding for that purpose. Personally I think this is going to be the most likely way that they will be incorporated outside of using them for loan collateral. There might be other options too like having the protocol fund some of these pools directly from fees collected in the stability buffer, but I\u2019ve seen some pushback from the community stating things like \u201cthis can be done more efficiently by end users.\u201d Speaking purely from conjecture here, it would seem to make sense to me if we used some of the mkr bought from flap auctions to fund for instance the DAI/MKR pool on uniswap to help ensure the long term health of the project for both of it\u2019s related tokens. That said, not sure how likely it is that we would see that happen. ",

Similarly, adding MKR would give a very nice exposure to MakerDAO. Generally speaking, even if I am not from a low income country, I am personally enjoying using xDai a lot: it\u2019s fast, the bridges work fine,  and the fact of spending only 0.0001 DAI for tx fees is just very pleasant. In my very humble opinion, xDAI-Network is going to grow over the next few months. ",
