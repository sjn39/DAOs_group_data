(original post) Although they are not many, I wanted to share the changes and tell you some ideas of what I\u2019m thinking how to improve it and would really appreciate your feedback.  See it live at What\u2019s backing my Dai? (web app)  Thanks for the support! @juan @prose11 @LongForWisdom @tmierzwa @piotr.klis @twblack88  ps: There is a slight deviation when comparing the metrics in http://mcdstate.info/. I\u2019m looking into it  .   What\u2019s next I\u2019ll include all the following development notes and futrue ones within the Notion page backeddai.makerdao.network.  Better website  Currently using streamlit and while easy it\u2019s pretty limiting. I\u2019m thinking of building it with Dash. The plots are already made with plotly so there won\u2019t any need to adapt them. Streamlit builds the visuals every time you refresh. With Dash and Heroku (hosting), we can have a database that refreshes periodically, so when someone loads the website they instantly see the newest information without needing to run the query.   Risk metric Include a metric that considers the relative risk of each coin. Right now you can see the collateralization ratio, but I think it\u2019s missing more context.Maybe the collaterization ration against liquidation ratio, the rolling volatility of the last 14 days.  Historical plot Look how the weights between coins changes through time. For example, how the introduction of USDC PSM vault affects the UCDC-A vault. Something like the Age of Empires II timeline   1280\u00d7720 137 KB   Treemap/Heatmap plot How do diffent vaults compare to each other? Another way to appreciate comparable sizes between different vaults.  ",
