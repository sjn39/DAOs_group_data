Specification  Core Unit ID EVENTS-001  Motivation MakerDAO is restructuring the work and the workforce across the DAO according to the Endgame Plan. The mandate for this Core Unit does not support a standalone core unit and will be better aligned within a cluster of a MetaDAO. As a result, this core unit must be offboarded to support the transition.  Core Unit Work Continuity All activities associated with EVENTS-001 will stop upon the ratification of this subproposal. MakerDAO will commit to pay for the following expenses of EVENTS-001 to unwind the Core Unit and deliver on their work obligations (DevCON Daivinity):     Item DAI Comment     Tax Payout $37,910 Sales tax on fait used by CU\u2019s corporate account   Accounting $10,000 Tax audit & general accounting   Legal $10,000 ~20 hours legal resources for audit & corporate wind down   Rent $8,340 Non-breakable lease for industrial workshop to build Daivinity materials   Motion Designers $16,667 Final payment to Motion Designer, non-cancellation clause due to reserving future time   Contractors $4,000 Payout to contractors booked for future planned events   FTE $88,332 DAI This is the 4 month golden parachute referenced below   AccountAble $7,435 Fee to convert above to Fiat   Total: $182,684      Funds in the Core Unit Multi-sig wallet will be used, and if an additional top-up is required, it will be provided through an Executive Vote.  Mandated Actor Status The facilitator will have their Mandated Actor status removed.  Golden Parachute  DAI A Golden Parachute payout will be provided to the Core Unit for the facilitator to distribute to their team. The amount will be based on the following calculations: Core Unit's Monthly Contributor Budget x 4 = Golden Parachute amount 22,083 DAI x 4 months = 88,332 DAI  MKR This Core Unit does not have an active MKR MIP40. No MKR is in scope.  Budget Implementation Upon ratification of this proposal:  All DAI DssVest streams will be terminated. Any amount of DAI over the unwinding expenses amount in the Core Unit\u2019s Multi-sig wallet will be returned to the protocol using DssBlow by the date of the following Executive Vote, or Governance will withdraw the funds in the Executive Vote using the MCD_Pause_Proxy beneficiary role on the multi-sig. If the unwinding expenses amounts is above the current balance in the Core Unit\u2019s wallet, the following Executive Vote will distribute the difference to the Core Unit.  ",

Upon ratification, all DAI DssVest streams will be terminated and the Facilitator will lose the mandated actor status. A total of 182,686 DAI for the unwinding work, plus a Golden Parachute of 66,250 DAI will be granted. If the amount of DAI in the Core Unit\u2019s multisig wallet exceeds the Golden Parachute amount + the unwinding provision (248,876 DAI total), it must be returned using DssBlow or will be withdrawn via the MCD_Pause_Proxy. If the amount of DAI in the Core Unit\u2019s multisig wallet is lower than the Golden Parachute amount + the unwinding provision (248,876 DAI total), the following Executive Vote will distribute the difference to the Core Unit.
