We\u2019re glad to announce that we recently added coverage for MakerDAO on our Governor product which tracks and summarizes discussions and proposals across forums, Polls, and Executive Votes.  makerdao_govdash1920\u00d71104 125 KB  You can find our MakerDAO proposal coverage here. We also added a governance profile detailing MakerDAO for our Pro/Enterprise subscribers. Any feedback is welcomed, and we would love to know how you use Messari Governor. Also, we would be happy to demo the product to the DAO\u2019s team or broader community to highlight how it can be valuable and chat about other governance services we can provide (ex: State of Optimism Governance). Enjoy, and feel free to share it with your community! ",

Yes this is the freeloading problem of open source contributions all over again but I wanted to plant a flag here and ask companies to start contributing for use of open source code and data.    MakerDAO: 2022 Financial Results and Retrospective   To the extent such firms end up recycling our crypto-GAAP query too, or portions thereof, we would kindly request voluntary ongoing donations of part of their subscription revenue attributable to MakerDAO reports to the Maker Pause Proxy address (0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB ).
