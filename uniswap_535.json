                    "content": "As I\u2019ve mentioned in a previous post, it\u2019s Uniswap\u2019s many integrations that keep volumes (and thus fees) high and relatively uncorrelated to liquidity. I think it would be valuable to develop a list of applications and products that support digital assets, but don\u2019t yet support Uniswap. Once we have this list, we can focus our efforts as a community to acquire these integrations. I\u2019ll start:   Ledger Swap (currently uses Changelly) Robinhood Square\u2019s Cash App  SoFi Revolut  The common theme of my targets is that they\u2019re retail user-facing applications, and therefore have overlap with our existing userbase. These integrations would allow applications which are currently focused on fiat-to-crypto on-ramping to allow a user-triggered assets swaps within the application without taking on any operational overhead such as sourcing liquidity. I will continue to amend this post to include a comprehensive list if this post gains enough quality feedback. ",

                    "content": "Good thinking. I like the idea of integrating with Leger or any other on-ramp that tries to become a one-stop-shop for crypto. If Ledger integrated Uniswap as the go-to exchange service for ERC-20 tokens instead of Changelly, Ledger users would win because of the better rates - and thus, their swapping interface would be used more. We could introduce a program where we pay part of the fees, like 0.05% of the volume that comes to Uniswap from Ledger, so that it would be even more beneficial for them. Like referral rewards. Integrating with CEXes is a harder sell, in my opinion, as there would be no efficiency boost for them like with Ledger and Changelly, and they take their own commission. I think an ongoing fee compensation reward shouldn\u2019t be in place for DEX aggregators, as we wouldn\u2019t get longer-term benefits from it. ",
