                    "content": " General Updates  MakerBrand Since GrowthCU\u2019s inception, we identified the need to create campaigns with our partners to announce and create use cases around their integrations with the Maker Protocol. This has given us a tool to communicate with their audience to show them Maker\u2019s power, and all these actions are under what we call \u201cB2B Activations\u201d. After months without the commonly called Marketing CU, we have seen new people/institutions interested in crypto and DeFi, and because it\u2019s their first time in the space, they don\u2019t know about Maker: for some of them, Maker is about stablecoins but is not a lending protocol, or worse, they don\u2019t link Maker with Dai. This challenge made us realize we have to do something, and as we have been doing the B2B Activations, it\u2019s more than natural for us to scale towards creating a \u201cMarketingCU\u201d. But, with the mindset of maintaining the DAO ethos, we decided to help evolve our internal B2B Activations team to convert it into MakerBrand, first as a team inside GrowthCU but with the vision of being an independent CU. MakerBrand will work on Maker\u2019s brand through initiatives to create ideas around what people think, feel, and say about Maker. We will post more details in the following weeks.

After several internal conversations with @pyramidmaker and PECU and talking with various of the most relevant MM in the ecosystem, we have identified the following solutions to increase Dai Liquidity in specific domains: Before the launch of Maker Vaults on L2  We have to integrate with intermediary protocols to give loans to MM by creating a D3M DAI pool within these protocols. These protocols will help us structure these loans without lending the DAI from the surplus buffer.  After the launch  We will onboard the GUNI token to increase liquidity through it.   EthRio. @Lozadaluis12 and @Corina talked about Maker:  Luis participated in the panel: Stablecoins and settlement, talking about the real uses cases for stablecoins in LATAM, mostly in Argentina and Vzla. Cori gave a presentation: Growing as a DAO - MakerDAO Lessons Learned. With the full house Cori explained the dissolution of the Foundation and how is the DAO being self-sustainable since past year. Few minutes later Cori participated in the panel: **DAOs & Governance experiences**.  Luis gave an interview to Beincrypto brazil, where he explained the situation in Vzla and how stablecoins like DAI helps the people to fight against inflation.  And we organized a side-Event with Lemon, one of the top crypto companies in Argentina, expanding to all Latam.  image1920\u00d71440 260 KB    Star of the week.
