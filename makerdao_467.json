We are happy to present vote comments for governance polls\u2014a feature that has been requested multiple times over the past few months. In addition to that, this release mainly consists of many bug fixes (especially on mobile), performance improvements, UI tweaks and preparations for soon-to-be-released features (eg. the return of the on-chain spell effects module and EIP-1559 related optimizations). This release felt like 'wrapping up\u2019 in various ways; it\u2019s the last sprint of 2021 but it\u2019s also the last sprint that we dedicate to some larger roadmap themes that we committed to a few months back during our Launch Pod presentation, hosted by SES CU. Early next year we\u2019ll host a Roadmap Spotlight presentation in which we\u2019ll look back on our work these past three months and also the prioritized themes for the first quarter of 2022 and some team updates. We\u2019re looking forward to the next year since we have some exciting roadmap work and larger Maker-wide initiatives planned. Stay tuned for more info on the DUX Roadmap Spotlight presentation! We\u2019ll be taking a short break from December 20th, to January 2nd. However, each day we\u2019ll have two team members on duty in case any any issues arise. As always, please join the conversation on our Discord server, or share product feedback and Maker governance UX ideas at https://makergovernance.canny.io/   Featured Changes  Vote comments for polling By popular request we have implemented vote comments for governance polls! It works similar to the current commenting flow for Executive proposals\u2014one minor difference is that the comment fields have been implemented into the ballot review page. This way a voter can add comments to multiple poll votes without added steps and transactions.  Screenshot_2021-12-16_at_18.38.55974\u00d7621 126 KB  We have also improved the UX of signing comments before submitting the actual vote transactions, as seen below.  Ending with a roadmap teaser\u2728 This feature marks the start of our focus on 'interactivity\u2019 as a feature focus. Over the next three months we\u2019ll explore ways to make the Governance Portal more integrated with other governance tools and enable more interactivity.  More transparency tweaks to Delegate profile pages  Screenshot_2021-12-16_at_18.37.30988\u00d7305 34.2 KB  We have added some small UI tweaks to the Delegate profile pages to more easily find relevant info at a glance, such as the total MKR voting power, the number of delegators and the address (ENS-resolved if applicable!) that created the delegate contract.
