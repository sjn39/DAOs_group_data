General pros and cons of an ice age in PoS Technical implementation of same  Proposition: Implement an ice-age mechanism in PoS. Rationale: \u201cIf one desires no-change, then a default of no-change is a good idea. If one desires change, then a default of change is a good idea.\u201d (Micah) \"The main things that I think people really want post-PoS are:  Data sharding Statelessness + state expiry ZK-SNARKing the EVM and other state transitions Miscellaneous security upgrades like VDF oracle, proof of custody, etc  Account abstraction (can be done mostly-off-chain with flashbots-like techniques, so it doesn\u2019t strictly require consensus changes (!!). And the cost of those changes above being delayed is definitely significantly lower than the cost of the merge being delayed.\" (Vitalik) Technical implementation ideas: \"  IA kicking in could decrease the gas limit, so that throughput decreases and the chain becomes more and more expensive to use IA kicking in could probabilistically invalidate more and more block proposal slots, similar results as above IA kicking in could increase slot times. Simple as a concept, but probably hairy in the details due to the implicit assumption of currently perfectly regular 12s slots.  Delaying slots looks easy at first sight, but I\u2019m not sure about what stuff implicitly depends on regular slots. And the regular slots are a bit too beautiful to touch them tbh Invalidating slots might work, but I\u2019m not sure if there is non-gameable randomness around to do so, so that it isn\u2019t gameable by the other validators / block proposers. But then it doesn\u2019t even have to be random. Something like \u201cslot x mod n is invalid\u201d, where n is very large initially and then slowly decreasing could work.\" (torfbolt) ",

                    "content": "I support the continuation of an Ice Age (IA) (aka Difficulty Bomb in PoW). For scheduling, I think as the years go on, there will be less need for frequent forking / upgrades of the base layer. But we don\u2019t want to permanently ossify when we don\u2019t know what \u201cfinished forever\u201d looks like, yet. With that in mind, I was personally hoping IA would roughly double each time they are diffused. As an example, from date of The Merge:  First IA would happen in 1.5 years. Second IA would happen 3 years after the first (4.5 from Merge). Third IA would happen 6 years after the second (10.5 from Merge).  I wouldn\u2019t suggest planning any further out than that, because there are just too many unknowns. If ossification is holding back regular upgrade forks, then we can reserve the right to keep the IA on a regular schedule perpetually. Or if upgrades aren\u2019t having any coordination issues, we can keep extending if further and further into the future, demonstrating a stronger foundation for dApps and protocols to build on top of. I don\u2019t think the IA should have influence on regular upgrade forks, so a schedule of IAs should not be construed as the only forks that are allowed. I think upgrade forks should be at the whim of client devs to write and at the whim of users to adopt. Pragmatically, Validators in some cases may be able to run both chains if they are cleanly forked away from each other, but dApps will likely have catastrophic choices to make between chains. For dApps the values of locked collateral cannot be equivalent on both chains. So I expect the chain will never actually split and that means the primary feature of an IA is as a protective anti-sybil mechanism for infrastructure providers. This means bad actors cannot pretend there is significant support for the default state compared to an upgrade. They at least have to make the minimum effort of updating the infrastructure to handle the IA, and I think that alone is an important enough feature to keep the IA around for a while. ",
