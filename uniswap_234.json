            "body": "Boba Network and Franklin DAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network.\n\nSummary\nIn cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to ICHI\u2019s Uniswap v3 management protocols (https://www.ichi.org/)) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.\nBoba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute (https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba\u2019s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\nIn addition, Boba Network is the first and only multichain (https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\nThe timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team.\n\nProposal\nWe believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:\nEthereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.\n\nLow cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum\u2019s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.\n\nDetails for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\nBoba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:\nThe incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.\n\nSecurity\nBoba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism\u2019s Optimistic Rollup codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba's state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.\nThe bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the \u201cchallenge window\u201d). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there\u2019s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.\nThe Boba Network codebase and Optimism\u2019s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.\nMore details about Boba Network can be found on our engineering roadmap.\n\nLicense Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\nTimeline\nAfter passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network, we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba Network.\n\nYes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba\nNo - Make no Change\n\nConclusion\nBoba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",

In response to the concerns, I think they are largely non-issues or largely related to the current overall macro conditions. Brand dilution doesn\u2019t seem to be a real issue here, as Boba Network has a real team with real backers and is here for the long-run. Meanwhile regarding its DeFi ecosystem, Boba indeed has a lower TVL but the entire market has suffered a massive decline in TVL and this is more a reflection of macro than of its specific ecosystem. Uniswap v3 and Boba can have a symbiotic relationship in growing this TVL again as the market bottoms out and begin to range. Overall deploying v3 on Boba is only a win-win for both sides and I strongly believe that the Uniswap community should move forward here on this approval. ",

                    "content": "GFX Labs voted against the Boba deployment proposal in the consensus check per the below comment, and we voted against the on-chain proposal for the same reasoning. We believe the protocol\u2019s time and efforts should be focused on chains with higher TVLs and user counts before supporting newer & smaller chains like Boba.     GFXlabs:  While GFX Labs generally favors additional Uniswap v3 deployments, we concluded that it would be premature to deploy Uniswap on Boba at this time. Note: DeFi Llama shows Boba with $3.7m in TVL. When considering additional deployments, we like to focus on growing Uniswap\u2019s market share of crypto trading and potential revenues from the additional deployment. In this instance, we lack the conviction to say a Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba would outweigh the potential downsides. If their chain grows further, we would be happy to reconsider. This might be an excellent opportunity to set up a framework/checklist for future Uniswap v3 deployments as we think there are several opportunities for deployments on other chains/L2s.   ",

The proposal has been published and will open for voting on Friday, Jan 27. Vote here starting Friday Special thanks to FranklinDAO for their strong work in bringing this proposal forward, and to @Getty and the GFX team for their attention and guidance through the process. Clarifying two points from previous discussion: 1- As an EVM chain, The Boba Foundation will be responsible for the deployment to Boba Network per the new Uniswap Foundation deployment protocol from a few weeks ago, requiring minimal work (if any) from the Uniswap Labs team. 2- Boba Network\u2019s Native Bridge will be used to transmit governance decisions from Ethereum L1 to the Boba Network Ethereum L2 instance of Uniswap V3. Thank you and looking forward to voting! ",

                    "content": "After careful consideration, Blockchain@Columbia has voted against the proposal with the following reasoning: The Boba Network experienced a 99% drop in their TVL during the past 2 months. The decentralized exchanges (DEX\u2019s) on Boba Network (like Oolongswap) only have a mid 5-figure daily volume as of today. Although these are understandable post-FTX and to some extent interpretable by the macroeconomic impact on the entire crypto sector, the profitability of Uniswap V3 on Boba Network is currently temporarily in doubt. Additionally and further expanding on this, there are inherent dangers to the brand image of the Uniswap Protocol, should the network or its associated deployment of V3 fall into misuse, get adversely affected, or popular chains of V3 not show profitable liquidity provisioning (as per the above brief analysis). Hence, to maintain Uniswap\u2019s brand image, it would not be responsible to lead the brand and its community to deploy on Boba Network at this particular moment. Finally, even though Uniswap V3\u2019s change of license is happening in 2 months, and the entire functional stack will be available under \u201cGPL 2.0 or later\u201d license, Boba Network or anyone in the ecosystem is still unauthorized to fork the project and make the entire V3 functional stack available on the network. A similar analogy (which we realize is not perfect but to which we would like to draw the attention of the community to) is that of the Android ecosystem: even though Android is for the most part open-source, unauthorized deployments of Android are still prohibited; specifically in our case, using the Brand Name of Uniswap V3, the front-end of Uniswap V3, and any trademarks that might be or might not be of relevance should still be disallowed despite the BSL expiry. We welcome the feedback of the community on our points raised with the above commentary, and would encourage further consideration and open, public discussion around the licensing change and what this means for deployments, as it seems that there are many (significant) aspects which remain unclear.
