Today I\u2019m writing to ask you to vote on the latest executive. https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/parameter-changes-and-oracle-updates?network=mainnet#proposal-detail This is of particular importance because the executive that is scheduled for later today involves adding the Uni-LP pairs to the Liquidations 2.0 frame work. Given that the current executive updates those oracles, it\u2019s pretty clearly a situation where we would be wise to follow the order of deployment. So dig deep, grab that piggybank of ETH for gas funds and vote away  oh yeah, as always  image500\u00d7582 74.4 KB  ",
