Live now, the OP token rewards will be followed this Thursday, with the commencement of a new protocol epoch, by boosted HND token emissions and a project rebrand. We hope the Optimism community will join us as we transition to a new look, and work to meet our commitment to a steady increase in TVL on our app and Optimism more broadly!

What is more, data from DeFi Llama demonstrates that this wasn\u2019t merely value already present on the network moving around. Comparison with our TVL figures on other chains demonstrates our users on Polygon and Fantom, in particular, were drawn to move large amounts over that hadn\u2019t previously been within and available to the Optimism ecosystem. Lastly and in summary, we also saw an increase in our own total cross-chain liquidity, implying that both Optimism and Hundred Finance have seen marked improvements in TVL as a result of our Phase 1 Optimism Grant-enabled program.

                    "content": "December 13th Update: Due to an error in the setting of gauge emissions for this week, a greater than planned number of OP tokens were sent to several rewards contracts. This has resulted in one week of unintentionally boosted APRs on USDC, sUSD, USDT and FRAX. In order to remain on course with the proposal, the Hundred Finance team has met the OP shortfall by purchasing the tokens on the market using existing treasury assets. This allows us to resume the emissions schedule as originally intended. In order to prevent a repeat of this, we are implementing further checks to ensure such an error does not occur again. The OP was purchased using 50,000 USDC from the project treasury here: Optimistic L2 Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Optimism Current gauge APRs:  image1482\u00d7650 48.8 KB  ",
