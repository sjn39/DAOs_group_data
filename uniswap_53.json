I think that one of its successes has been to convince the authorities that this system can be reliable, transparent and open to all types of investors. I say this, because many questioned that the people who handle ourselves in this system do it to avoid paying taxes, etc. The issue of legal certainty, fiscal transparency, from my point of view, in the long term, is a crucial issue that will make a difference. In my opinion, this is a theme that should be implemented in our project. From the user\u2019s point of view, it is about being able to get reports with the movements that we have made in a given period of time. From here, each region, country, has tax obligations, etc., but it is logical that the user can extract their movement history. What do you think? ",

Of course, a web page could be created to show user\u2019s Uniswap transactions. But it\u2019s not what one needs for tax reporting.

This site has a very clear message \u201cTrack your cryptocurrency portfolio and taxes\u201d. It includes a free part and several payment modules. Even considering the payment formula, it seems to me a very good option to integrate a project of this type in our platform. We must realize that the largest exchanges are made on the ETH network and that we lead this sector together with Defi. In my opinion, the security of being able to extract this data from our platform will improve the experience and trust of new users in our project. I do not have enough votes to propose a vote to the community, but I encourage everyone to see it from the point of view of new users who join the sector and want to do so with all the guarantees. I only wish and hope that this idea will be read by those who have the ability to propose a vote to the community and that we can vote for it. Much encouragement to everyone and a big hug! ",
