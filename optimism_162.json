Since launching on Optimism over 6 months ago, dHEDGE has been rapidly increasing integrations with other Optimism protocols Aave, 1inch, Kwenta and Uniswap, in addition to launching our own incubated protocol Toros Finance on Optimism in April. Toros Finance runs automated strategies on Optimism including the Synthetix Debt Hedging service, which quickly accrued over $1m in TVL weeks after launching. Our protocol vision is to build a future where everyone has simple and reliable access to financial freedom so that society\u2019s quality of life is improved. This is tightly aligned with the Optimistic Vision of reliably providing for basic human needs at scale.  Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 11.29.18 pm790\u00d7385 38.9 KB  Proposal for token distribution:  How will the OP tokens be distributed?  The intention is for any granted OP to be distributed as additional staking rewards received by DHT Optimism stakers, increasing the attractiveness of the DHT staking program on Optimism. The OP tokens will be distributed over a period of 6 months (along with DHT) via a new staking mechanism which rewards only value-generating TVL on both dHEDGE and other Optimism protocols which are integrated with dHEDGE (eg. Synthetix, Uniswap, Aave etc). The new staking model is designed to increase protocol engagement via more tightly aligning DHT incentive emissions with real value created on the protocol. In the new model, users will be required to pair their staked DHT with staked dHEDGE Pool Tokens to receive incentives. dHEDGE governance has a proposal in-place which, if passed, will bring DHT Staking to Optimism for the first time. New Staking Mechanism summary The proposed new staking mechanism requires users to stake $DHT paired with an allocation of specific dHEDGE Pool tokens (DHPT). This is designed to ensure staking rewards are going to users who are involved in the value creation on the protocol, versus solely locking protocol token liquidity. Not all dHEDGE pools will be able to be staked initially, dHEDGE will operate a whitelisting process to ensure the stakeable pools are of sufficient performance and TVL. dHEDGE has yet to confirm which DHT:DHPT pairs will be stakeable, but will include the Toros automated strategies e.g. Stablecoin Yield, and a new market neutral strategy launching the week of 25th July. As an example, a user could stake 200 DHT with $1000 of the Stablecoin YIeld pool. As the time staked increases, combined with performance increases in Stablecoin Yield, the users potential staking rewards will increase. Variables influencing the total rewards eligible include i) time staked, ii) performance of staked pool token, and iii) the dollar ratio of staked $DHT to $DHPT. Please see the attached Proposal (below) for more detailed information. Rewards are paid out at the time of unstaking, which is where dHEDGE intends to allocate an equivalent amount of OP to the $DHT being emitted.    dHEDGE DAO \u2013 12 Jul 22    DFP-33: New DHT Staking Model 2.0 Header Content     Author Mat Nelsen(@taminater)   Created 2022-7-12   Status Draft     Motivation See also: Initial forum post   The Status Quo of Staking DHT The current dHEDGE staking system rewards DHT holders that choose to lock up their DHT in...  Reading time: 3 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 2 \u2764        How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  Given the OP distribution is intended to increase DHT Staking incentives, this mechanism is primarily aimed at increasing value-generating TVL on dHEDGE and Optimism. The entire design of the new staking mechanism is targeted to create closer alignment between protocol revenue and staking rewards, closely aligning the incentives of dHEDGE DAO and stakers. These incentives are also aligned with increased Optimism engagement. Currently there\u2019s $1m DHT staked on Mainnet, and the new staking proposal will sunset mainnet staking. Additional OP rewards would help encourage that $1m in liquidity to migrate directly to Optimism. The staking mechanism skews emissions towards pool performance, such that if there\u2019s no performance generated by the staked strategies, there\u2019s no associated OP or DHT emissions.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  The incentivised users and liquidity will remain on protocol after the OP incentives have been exhausted due to the design of the new staking proposal. Stakers earn incentive rewards when their underlying pool tokens perform well. This means that users that receive incentives also get real value from the protocol and are less reliant on additional incentives. The staking system also increases rewards to stakers who max out their \u2018duration bonus\u2019 (a linearly increasing multiplier that maxes out after 6 months staked). The design of the mechanism is aimed at making the decision to remain staked more lucrative as time increases. The additional OP will create the added benefit of increasing the attractiveness of our staking program, bringing more users and TVL to the protocol and contributing to their decision to remain staked for longer.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Given the duration bonus maxes out after 6 months, we\u2019d look to make accrued OP rewards available to users over a distributed 6 month horizon. Users receive their staking rewards at the point of unstaking, they do not accrue as per a typical staking emissions scheme. So stakers are offered a choice to unstake and receive rewards versus remaining staked and enjoying an increasing duration bonus.  Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what\u2019s the status of these tokens?  dHEDGE has not received any grant funding from Optimism.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  dHEDGE will match the granted OP 1:1 in dollar terms with DHT incentives to stakers. ",

Protocols of a similar size have been requesting in the 100k-250k OP token rage, which I think is more appropriate. *** the biggest concern *** 2.) In order to be eligible for token distribution, users are required to buy the dHEDGE token. While working on a new staking system might be something that makes sense internally, this feels a lot like have optimism subsidize the price of the token. I don\u2019t see how helping dHEDGE \u201ccreate closer alignment between protocol revenue and staking rewards\u201d is helping drive usage or liquidity to optimism. 3.) There is an undefined whitelist for the pools where these token distributions will go. What\u2019s stopping dHEDGE from allocating all of the tokens to their own pools? To me this proposal doesn\u2019t seem to have aligned incentives with OP at all, and I will be voting no. I recommend others do this same and I\u2019m happy to clarify my logic on why this seems like a direct subsidy of the dHEDGE token price. ",

                    "content": "Looking to address a couple of misinterpretations of our proposal. Points addressed in order below from @Michael\u2019s post Grant request The amount of OP requested is based on our current staking and DHT performance mining emissions rate. dHEDGE currently distributes 35,000 DHT per week in staking rewards, and 25,000 DHT per week in performance mining (a reward for being invested in well performing pools). At current prices this equates to around $250,000 over six months. During the analysis and drafting of our proposal, $OP was around $0.50 and we sized the OP request accordingly. The total ask is also conservative based on the rate of granted OP per Optimism TVL from other similar passed proposal requests:  New Staking Mechanism The new staking mechanism is fundamentally designed to increase protocol utilisation and engagement as well as support governance of the protocol. Staking rewards are not set-and-forget: they are only redeemable on unstaking which requires an investor to monitor pool performance to assess an optimal time to claim rewards. (Once claimed, an investor then needs to restake with reset staking reward parameters and the process restarts). dHEDGE is about to drive a migration of staked liquidity onto L2. Fundamental to the new staking mechanism is sunsetting staking on mainnet and enabling staking on L2 for the first time.  Given dHEDGE is on Optimism and Polygon, current DHT stakers have a choice on which L2 to continue staking on. There\u2019s currently $1m DHT staked on mainnet, and migrating dHEDGE governance to Optimism is part of the motivation for this grant application. Pool Whitelisting The requirement for a pool to be whitelisted for staking rewards is to ensure rewards can\u2019t be gamed through subversive pool management. The whitelist of pools is to offer quality investment vehicles that maximise a stakers opportunity to receive rewards. The composition of the initial whitelist will be decided by governance vote. Whitelisting requirements may include: minimum TVL, minimum manager ownership %, minimum Sortino ratio, and/ or minimum recent performance. ",

Tokens received in this way tend to be dumped as soon as the investors receive them.This method is more like \u201cgetting something for nothing\u201d which I\u2019m not sure is conductive for growth on Optimism or dHEDGE. With the new staking mechanism on dHEDGE, only managed pools that perform positively, their invested stakers receive any reward with incentives. In addition, investors don\u2019t receive rewards continuously, but only when they close their staked position. And they receive reward relative to their performance, maxing out after a certain performance threshold. For a protocol like dHEDGE, the protocol doesn\u2019t earn fees unless the manager perform positively. This system emphasizes investors to choose the best managers, and managers to perform well and consistently to attract investors. As for the OP received, it should be put in context of the TVL dHEDGE has on Optimism. dHEDGE Optimism TVL has been growing consistently. I see Cyrus posted a quote of 2.5M earlier today. Currently it\u2019s at 2.77M. Compared to other protocols who\u2019s OP grant was approved, we have a much lower OP distribution request per Optimism TVL. In the broader context, this proposal is stating an equivalent amount of DHT will be matched on dollar terms. If we were to remove this staking component, that would no longer be the case, as DHT is only given out based on the new staking mechanism. A follow up proposal where OP tokens where given out to users without an onchain mechanism incentivizing positive behavior for both DHT and the Optimism network, dHEDGE would have to give out free DHT using a system the protocol has already found doesn\u2019t work too well. I understand the concern about it being staking, however, it would be most valid if DHT wasn\u2019t being given out on at least an equivalent rate. As the Optimism grant is flat, best case scenario, more DHT is given out than OP due to performant managers. The base scenario, an equivalent portion of DHT and OP are distributed, though OP only for a limited time, per the size of the grant. ",

This proposal isn\u2019t a token swap, and no where is it stated that the intention is to increase DHT price.The main purpose is to incentivize TVL through incentivizing managers outperforming the market, and investors investing in those managers. dHEDGE has pivoted away from doing flat rate inflationary rewards to achieve this, as previous incentive models, as the one you seem to imply to prefer, wasn\u2019t triggering the desired effect. I actually don\u2019t expect 12% of DHT supply to be distributed in 6 months. Looking through the history of this post, it was requested to reduce the stated time to 6 months down from 1 year. But to me, looking at the model, and OP requested, given that OP will only be used for incentives as per the proposals, and OP distribution to users is being matched to DHT price, I expect OP to be distributed to dHEDGE users in this way for 1-3 years, just from this allocation alone.

What we would like to see dHEDGE do with OP incentives is create a sticky ecosystem that avoids mercenary/opportunistic capital. If we only incentivise liquidity, it\u2019s fine, but only halfway there. We\u2019ve seen on Alt L1s how quickly capital leaves when new opportunities arise/or when incentives dry up. It\u2019s the main reason we\u2019ve looked to overhaul our staking mechanism. So how do we boost loyalty? One way is by incentivising both productive usage + governance (skin in the game) on Optimism. This combo is the closest user alignment with a protocol. If we aim to make Optimism the homebase for protocols, this becomes a competitive advantage over other chains / rollups. On the point of DHT token price pressure - there\u2019s currently 8m of staked DHT on mainnet that this proposal aims to migrate to Optimism. If even half of this DHT bridges across, this would max out* staking rewards without any further DHT required to be purchased. *the new staking mechanism has an optimal ratio of vDHT:DHPT. Holding excess vDHT without an equivalent increase in dollar value of DHPT does not increase accrued rewards. This is specifically designed to incentivise pool token ownership and protocol engagement, which will increase overall TVL and usage on Optimism.

Emissions are dynamic, based on the performance of TVL If all staked pool tokens have 0% or less performance from when the pool tokens are staked, then there are 0 emissions, both for DHT and OP, as they are matched. If all staked pool tokens have a pool performance of 50% or more, it appears the max emissions rate is reached over 6 months. The 500k OP tokens are distributed to investors on the platform, and more DHT is distributed than OP in dollar terms, assuming the current price of DHT and OP. How the model works, less emissions are done if manager performance is poor (more likely during a bear market), and more emissions are done if manager performance is high, up to a cap (more likely during a bull market). So the range the tokens would be distributed would range from 6 months at earliest if manager performance is high, to an unknown max in year terms if manager performance is low. ",

I\u2019m especially wary of this situation given the amount requested is fairly sizable. I know you mentioned that if half of the staked DHT on mainnet gets migrated, then staking rewards will get maxed out but I\u2019m not necessarily confident with this assumption and that at least some subset of new users wouldn\u2019t buy the token for getting rewards. I understand the goal of wanting users to have more governance skin in the game but I don\u2019t think that the Optimism governance fund should be the one incentivizing this vs dHedge.

The idea to align our OP grant proposal with the new dHEDGE staking mechanism was due to clear synergies with what we think is one of the better ways to truly align productive protocol usage + governance. Our incentives model combines both a governance token and a TVL deposit to increase the stickiness of TVL brought by incentives, and ensure governance voters have used the platform. Aligning external incentives with protocol staking rewards enables the creation of longer term engagement through i) rewarding actions that benefit the protocol and ii) increasing governance engagement. Our proposal includes both of these features. What we\u2019re trying to avoid is situations like the below example where a significant amount of L2 rewards were allocated to LPs in a specific protocol. This program quickly attracted TVL, which also quickly left when rewards dried up in late June.
