The Uniswap v3 Core repository contains the essential, low-level smart contracts that power the protocol. The Uniswap v3 Periphery repository contains a collection of smart contracts designed to ease user interaction with core contracts. A liquidity provider migration portal will be available at launch, allowing v2 LPs to seamlessly transfer their liquidity to the new protocol. ",

                    "content": "The deployment of Uniswap v3 brings some pretty significant changes and additional powers to UNI governance. To review, UNI token holders already have control over the following via Uniswap governance (see v2 blog post):  Uniswap v1 SOCKS/ETH LP tokens Community treasury UNI allocation Control over the Uniswap v2 fee switch Uniswap.eth ENS domain   New Updates Uniswap v3 will grant UNI governance additional controls including:  Deciding Uniswap v3 fees on a individual pool basis, with several protocol fee levels to choose from Uniswap v3 license (via the Uniswap.eth ENS domain) Ability to create new swap fee tiers in addition to the existing 0.05%, 0.3% and 1% options   Governance Responsibilities and Choices Here are some quick takes on upcoming governance decisions and operational needs. This is meant to be a jumping off point for discussion so please call out my blind spots  Deciding fee strategy for Uniswap v2 Governance can turn on the 0.05% swap fee on Uniswap v2 to earn revenue from trading volumes. Pros:  Earn protocol revenue Passively incentivize migration to Uniswap v3 (where protocol fees will be off by default until governance turns them on)  Cons:  Makes competing AMM/DEX platforms more competitive for LPs, and reduces their need to continue paying out high user incentives (eg Balancer v1, Sushiswap, etc) Uniswap may have less dominance in \u201clong tail\u201d / small cap assets  Deciding fee strategy for Uniswap v3 V3 gives governance a lot of strategic discretion, with fees turned on in a case by case process and several protocol fee share options (10-25% of swap fee). This is a lot more open ended than the binary on/off decision for v2 fees. Some heuristics we can consider for fee setting in v3 include:  Liquidity fragmentation: Having multiple fee tier pools of the same pair is sub optimal from a gas perspective. It could make sense to charge reduced fees on the highest liquidity/trading volume instance of each asset pair to incentivize LPs sticking together. Bridge asset incentivization: Certain assets (eg fiat stablecoins, ETH, wrapped BTCs, etc) are provide greater utility to the platform overall because they help traders bridge between smaller assets. It could make sense to favor pairs including at least one of these assets with lower protocol fee rates over the long term. Competitive positioning: v3 gives Uniswap a much greater ability to compete on \u201clike kind\u201d asset swaps (eg USDC to DAI, WBTC to renBTC). The community may want to incentivize LPs for these pairs by keeping fees low.  Handling assets accumulated from fees Once Uniswap turns on v2 or v3 fees, it will begin to accumulate protocol earnings in hundreds of separate tokens. While some of the assets might be worth holding on to (USDC, DAI, ETH, WBTC, UNI, certain defi tokens, etc), there are also a lot of low cap/low quality assets trading on the platform. How will Uni governance decide which tokens to dump vs hold? What asset should we consolidate earnings into? Should we invest into Uniswap pools or other yield opportunities? How will asset management work in practice, considering it may be infeasible to hold governance votes for each transaction?  Next Steps It would be great to hear your perspective on these issues, or any other key challenges you see upcoming for Uniswap governance.  ",

Handling assets accumulated from fees Once Uniswap turns on v2 or v3 fees, it will begin to accumulate protocol earnings in hundreds of separate tokens.  I suggest that we have a strategic asset allocation and rebalance exposure programatically based on the strategic targets. A treasury committee can set this allocation, which should be approved by governance. The committee can review the strategic target every quarter. Assets can be divided into three tranches based on market cap, liquidity, months since launch, volatility, return potential, etc. Here is what a sample classification could look like:   Low risk: stablecoins like DAI, USDC & interest bearing assets like yDAI, cUSDC  Medium risk: ETH, WETH, WBTC, UNI, and other bluechip DeFi tokens like SNX, COMP, AAVE, MKR, etc.  High risk: long tail of tokens outside the first two tranches that have lower liquidity  We can determine how much should be allocated across each tranche, e.g. 30% in low risk, 50% in medium risk, and 20% in high risk. We should also make sure that this allocation strategy aligns with Uniswap\u2019s overall treasury allocation as well as its spending plans, such as the grants program. Pros:  Projects will be less upset or surprised when Uniswap sells one token vs. another. We can point anyone to our stated policy. We can maintain prudent asset allocation without a requiring too much active management.  Cons:  We may leave some alpha/upside on the table by not taking active views on some of the long-tail of tokens. For example, we might have accrued tokens in the next big crypto protocol but have insufficient exposure because of rebalancing.  Open to feedback and other ideas! ",

As you pointed out it will actively incentivize LP migration, and create a new revenue stream for the treasury. The sooner liquidity pools are built up, and well funded on v3 the better for everyone really. Decisions on what to do with accrued assets, and the optimal fee strategy for v3; while still important, can be better fleshed out at a later time. Personally I would be in favor of moving assets strictly to stable coins and/or ETH to best preserve the treasury\u2019s value when a bear market comes along. Perhaps it\u2019s best to break out the various pieces you\u2019ve mentioned into separate tracks? ",

This is a large upfront cost for the initial pool creator to bear; however, this could be recouped.  By turning on Fees, we could allow for the first 0.33 ETH worth of fees to be used to payback the pool creator.  Benefits:   Eliminates barrier to entry for new \u2026     ",

UNI V2 is still the best place to start a new project LP in the Ethereum ecosystem unless Uniswap competitors are willing to incentivize your project with their own token allocations. I think at least until Uni V3 has better go-to solutions when it comes to outside liquidity mining programs, it\u2019s better to keep the switch off in most cases. Also, creating a revenue stream for the treasury wouldn\u2019t be my highest priority at this point as it comes at a cost. There\u2019s a lot of money in the treasury that the governance doesn\u2019t have a clear idea and consensus on what to do with. Adding some ETH there wouldn\u2019t change that.

At this point, more than choosing a specific action, any sign of activism would be positive for Uniswap. We\u2019ve had 3 proposals in 9 months, which is well below the industry\u2019s standard. Part of it can be justified by the stealth launched of the core team, but not everything. Now it\u2019s the community\u2019s time to shine (especially since the core team has publicly committed to now work alongside the community). A good place to begin with might be treasury management as pointed by @HelloShreyas. There are various solutions, let\u2019s here them out and vote on it. ",

I am not so much a trader but love the oportunity of providing liquidity which I regard as \u2018passive trading\u2019. Most of my liquidity is right now in uniswap v2 and balancer and ofc I might move some funds in the future. But fees alone, if not too high, wouldn\u2019t make me move to another place, it\u2019s also the expectation of trading volume/earning possibilities and also expectation of sustainability cause it\u2019s expensive to move the funds. Right now I prefer to wait how uniswap v3 will evolve, also what kind of possibilities balancer v2 will give me and only when I see one place clearly superior to uniswap v2 and balancer v1 I will make my decission what to place where, but for sure I will consolidate to fewer pools to save on gas instead of splitting the liquidity to much.

                    "content": "I would suggest turning on the fee switch and have higher fee for higher charging pools, so if 1% then it will be 0.1% for the pool, if 0.3% it will be 0.05% if 0.05% it will be 0.01%. The reason to turn on the fee switch now is that v3 given a highly competitive position for uniswap, now for a 0.05% fee, uniswap will still be at the same position. This can provide incentives for UNI holders including developers and investor to gain value for their work and capital and not just be a free protocol all the time. It is also better to turn on as v3 is just released and if the fee switch is turn on as a changes for v2 \u2192 v3, it will make sense and build habit for future LP providers. For fees gain from v2 and v3 protocols, it will be best to just hold all fees and if possible create a function for UNI to be burned and releases the portion of tokens from the treasury, or to be later determine by UNI holders to do buy back from public market. This create a situation where UNI start becoming an index token for all tokens, and if small tokens such as SHIB become popular UNI holders will earn some part of its gain, and it is also costly to sell small tokens when it is not yet valuable. Becoming an index token can also help the UNI value to be \u201cUp only\u201d if the crypto market is growing. It is also important to consider how we can launch an on chain voting for it to happen.
