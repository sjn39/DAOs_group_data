Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesn\u2019t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals.

Specification  Introduction B.Protocol makes lending platforms more stable by incentivizing liquidity providers (keepers) to commit on liquidation of under collateralized loans and shift the miners extracted profits back to the users of the platform. We integrated B.Protocol with MakerDAO, letting the users interact with the lending platform they are used to, via a dedicated smart contract interface. B.Protocol liquidators get a priority in the liquidation process which helps them manage risk in a more predictable manner. In return, Liquidators share their proceeds with B.Protocol users, making it a win-win situation for all parties involved:  MakerDAO as a platform get additional players to participate in the liquidation process. Users get extra value (share the liquidation proceeds) with no extra risk. Liquidators get better predictions and hence can better manage their risk.  B.Protocol is using the OSM so liquidators could topup CDPs that are expected to be liquidated in the next price update. This way after the price update, the usual bite process is prevented, and an \u201cinternal\u201d liquidation (unwind) process happens on B.Protocol.
