I believe GTC was sent to the following teams:  CLR Fund Prime DAO Developer DAO  And then it looks like the Snapshot vote was successful for the Radicle alliance/partnership, but I don\u2019t see the Tx on-chain. Did that one end up going anywhere? I know PGF has been staffing and working on mutual grants for a few seasons now so I would love to get caught up on progress and how these are going. Are there any sort of monthly reports in how we are partnering that I can review? ",

                    "content": "Hey Kyle - I really appreciate these questions! Regarding the mutual grants committee,  we had our first meeting on May 15th (active for 3 months / 1 season now). In that amount of time, we\u2019ve:   Confirmed and onboarded the following committee members  Scott Moore Vishnu Kumar Jeff Morris QZ Hum Maxwell Kanter Dane Lund Ale Borda Simona Pop    Created a methodology for considering mutual grants (summarized below):   Values Alignment  Is the project clearly focused on helping to improve funding for open source software? Does it benefit the narrative of public goods both in theory and practice? (e.g. is this funding shared infrastructure, education, and so on)    Strategic Utility  Are there clear reasons each project would need to participate in each other\u2019s governance (do we have a shared project together)? Are there strategic advantages to doing so for both projects? (e.g. does this tie into our grants 2.0 vision, are we driving value together in some way)    Feasibility & Effectiveness  Is it realistic to expect, based on all past actions and statements, that both parties will be able to uphold their end of the bargain and be meaningful participants in each other\u2019s projects for the long term? (e.g. does this require resources / time we don\u2019t actually have, does the project even have enough liquidity)    Growth Potential  Do we expect that there is meaningful and sustainable potential for growth over time? (e.g. will number go up, do we expect that our partnership will last almost in perpetuity)      Evaluated potential 30 mutual grants based on the above criteria   Passed 1 mutual grant - in line with our goal of 1 mutual grant / season   Regarding other mutual grants before we established the committee:   CLR Fund   CLR fund was before my time so don\u2019t have as much context there - but according to this post, that was a pure grant without expectations attached, not a mutual grant : \u201cThis grant is a no strings attached gesture to the CLR.Fund team. It is possible the two projects may formally work together in the future, but not a requirement for the dispersal of funds.\u201d     PrimeDAO   Working together on Proposal Inverter tooling for proposals  The Proposal Inverter inverts the DAO proposal relationship, creating one common proposal multiple DAOs can participate in - streamlining D2D coordination and web3 coalition building.   Inverter MVP Backend Spec Proposal Inverter Tech Spec - Google Docs Inverter MVP Mechanism Design Spec \t\t\thttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1KQfOk5UVdLCQSY36Y0aeGveYHPM86nywY9V81XOv0/edit Initial Research article Exploring DAO2DAO Collaboration Mechanisms | by BlockScience | PrimeDAO | Medium       Nominated Dane Lund as the Gitcoin delegate to PrimeDAO and he is spending time in their community in anticipation of participating in PrimeDAO governance on Gitcoin\u2019s behalf   We are also working with stakeholders from PrimeDAO to help fund novel funding experiments (pgDAO)     Developer DAO   IIRC we did the mutual grant with Developer DAO due to the projected success of the project - based on their already impressive community growth + engagement.   We were able to secure favorable terms due to our relationship with Developer DAO leadership and hope to see this mutual grant pay off in multiple ways very soon.   As far as progress goes - Developer DAO just launched their governance token in the past week - which is a huge milestone - and are currently setting up their foundation.   We are looking forward to becoming large stakeholders in Developer DAO governance in the imminent future.     Radicle  Radicle Snapshot Vote was just passed on their side (Radicle team had some changes due to visa issues). We are about to distribute the tokens from our side. About to start meta-governance coordination - with myself acting as the Gitcoin delegate.    I\u2019d recommend reaching out to @ceresstation directly after he returns from OOO for the notes on mutual grants - we are hesitant to share these in a public forum due to the sensitive nature of evaluating projects in the ecosystem. As far as non-mutual grant partnerships go - we\u2019ve been excelling there as well.

We\u2019re on track for it to be one of the largest rounds yet - without any multisig dependence! We\u2019d love to give you read access to Hubspot (if you don\u2019t have access already, which you should) - so that you can keep track of our partnerships efforts in real time! Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, and thanks again for prompting this conversation! ",
