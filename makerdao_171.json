They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but when I come to think of it not many other crypto projects tried to copy this aspect of Maker - for various reasons. Anyway, time to retire the old furnace and get ourselves a brand new solution in the form of the Sagittarius Engine. Needless to say, Sagittarius has yet to be detailed, and precisely because we do not know how long it will take to implement, now is the time to start saving funds to start it. Do you agree to the following proposal:  The Buy & Burn function is turned off Surplus Buffer stays at DAI 60 million until otherwise decided Funds in excess of the Surplus Buffer is directed to the Sagittarius Engine for future use      Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Feel free to argue pros and cons in the comments.

This is not how I read it. Directly quoting Rune\u2019s article    The case for Clean Money   The primary incentive to do this is the ability to borrow from the pool of Dai accumulated from protocol surplus in the Sagittarius Engine, using the locked up MKR as collateral.   This is a normal Vault for staked MKR with some interesting extras. We already have Vaults, we have MKR staked in the Gov contracts and we can adjust parameters. On top of that comes the bonus DAI from the Sagittarius Engine. I will go out on a limb here and say we are 80% done already. Additionally we could need a liquidity mining program (to soak up MKR prior and during dilution). Just maybe we could allow for normal use of MKR Vaults as well to cover all bases since the old arguments about not having MKR Vaults are already out the window. This is highly doable - maybe not ready for Christmas - but not long after. ",

So the initial calcs for a MKR 100 salmon will be something like (assuming 1 MKR = 2500 DAI) Start Vault with 100 staked MKR. With let\u2019s say 150% liquidation ratio, DSR-like Stability Fee and heavily lubricated liquidation settings we are looking at drawing DAI 1002500(1/1.5) = max DAI 167,000. Additionally there is the Sagittarius DAI at 1.0 billion / maybe 1.0 million staked MKR * 250 (Sally the Salmon\u2019s holding) = DAI 250,000. That is a total whopping DAI 417,000 out of a position with a street value of DAI 250,000. And there is no overcollateralization - you just use the Sagittarius Engine to boost.

Governance hasn\u2019t even agreed to pursue Sagittarius at this point. You could achieve the same goal just by creating a signal to increase the surplus buffer, disregarding all the Sagittarius stuff. Given that @rune 's proposal represents a huge shift in what Maker is and how it operates, I would recommend giving it some time for discussion before jumping to votes. Further, when we do vote on it, it should be more clear exactly what we are voting for. Is a vote for this signal a vote for Rune\u2019s entire proposal? It mentions \u2018funds are directed to the SE\u2019 so this is unclear. Also, even just turning buy-and-burn off permanently would need a more substantial proposal and discussion (IE, a MIP) rather than a signal. So, on balance I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll be including this in the weekly cycle for an on-chain poll regardless of the outcome, given that other processes are much more appropriate for a change of this magnitude. I do appreciate the enthusiasm @Planet_X, everyone is excited, but yeah for this more than anything else, we need to ensure that the governance process is as bulletproof as possible. If you just want to prevent burns in the meantime, I\u2019d suggest putting up a signal to increase the surplus buffer only. ",

Step one should be to have transparent discussions about its design and what we are really looking for in a tokenomics system. However, I am in favor of increasing the surplus buffer and not doing any more MKR burn because I think it is simply a waste of our resources. I dont believe it provides the kind of benefit we need at this point. I have also designed what I think is a much more sensible burn engine that is meant to run alongside the sagittarius engine, but at the current phase we are wrt growth, burning MKR should just not be a priority. I designed the basic concept of the buy and burn engine in 2015, it was one of the first ever tokenomics systems and for sure the oldest one still around today\u2026 its not really a surprise that it wasnt exactly the greatest solution ever, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with admitting that. On the contrary if we can recognize why it is suboptimal, and recognize what we are looking for in a good alternative, we have demonstrated the power of a DAO to evolve and learn from its environment and itself.

Even without the perspective of creating another tokenomics around MKR, I pushed for increasing the Surplus Buffer multiple times (2020-12, 2021-01, 2021-03) but the last one did not get proper support onchain.

Also notification to @ultraschuppi Yes - I voted against raising the Surplus Buffer. Why? Four reasons:  Because DAI 60 million is, in my opinion, more than sufficient for our current risk profile. RWA is still in its infancy, Liquidation 2.0 works fantastically well. I want the size of the Surplus Buffer to be determined by an agreed formula, not sentiment. The Surplus Buffer has moved from being a risk management tool to becoming more of a savings account. As long as there was no strategy, I felt that funds could just as well be spent on the burner.  With the announcement of Rune\u2019s new proposal, saved up funds now actually have a purpose. Therefore my change of mind on this question. ",

But I think there is an elephant in the room nobody talks about in the forum (rightly so, because our community is not about shills/pumps/announcement-of-announcements, etc): the price of MKR. In MakerDAO tokenomics (of today), the price of MKR is important in case of losses: e.g., during Black Thursday we lost a few millions usd (<10m) of value in bad liquidations, and we had to print-and-sell MKR to cover our losses. At that time this event almost killed MakerDAO (the price of MKR dropped by almost 60% in a couple of days from ~600Dai to 250Dai)\u2026 and all for ~10m usd of losses. Today we have 6.6b DAI outstanding and potential losses are way bigger than 10m usd. Sure, we have ~60m in Surplus. But what happens if we get a loss of 100m usd for some reason? Fact: The ratio (let me call it \u201csafety ratio\u201d)  Safety Ratio: (MKR marketcap)/(DAI outstanding)  has gone down a LOT in the last  2 years since BT: this is due to relative low MKR appreciation and huge increase of DAI outstanding. TL&DR: if the narrative of MKR-holders carrying the risk in case of bad events is still true, we need to massively increase the value of MKR, and dramatically increase its liquidity. How? Well, the buy&burn was the old answer. And I think in Dec 2020 when we kept burning for more than 1 month, we managed to absorb a big sell by Polychain and all of a sudden, after they sold their bags, the price of MKR shoot up. To conclude:     rune:  I think the best way to make it more appealing to accumulate cash to be spent on growth, rather than spend it on burn   Yeah I think 99.99% of the community agrees with growth vs burn, but we can\u2019t keep lowering our Safety Ratio for much longer imho. EDIT: perhaps @Primoz can shed some professional light on how much DAI we can realistically imagine to be able to get (today) by printing MKR in case of accidents, like in a BT event. ",

It would allow us to get returns on the assets that are now sitting in the surplus buffer, while still being able to access them in a situation where we suffer severe losses (and potentially have more available since they\u2019ve been generating a return).   We need to separate the cash from the capital discussion. The Surplus Buffer is the accumulation of profit/loss and proceeds from MKR burn/sold. Currently, it\u2019s 55M. On the assets side, we have cash and cash equivalent-like stuff which are the PSMs. We have 3.5B of them ready to be invested and fully under our control. We also can expand the balance sheet as much as we want increasing the leverage. If we create a yvDAI-PSM with 1B DC, fill it, we would still a SB of 55M (you suck 1B from the SB, convert that to yvDAI-PSM, get 1 DAI back, refill the SB). It would increase DAI in circulation by 1B (increasing liabilities and leverage). Most likely than not, yvDAI yield would decrease due to the influx, so some people would exist and move to yvUSDC which would decrease the USDC-PSM. We could invest 100B in yvDAI. That would make DAI being 106B of market cap. The problem is our inability to invest in assets (hence why we have plenty of USDC), it is not at all the surplus buffer. If we want to deploy our assets to fight climate change it will mean taking more risks. Hence we need a bigger surplus buffer (or whatever the capital stack is called). You can\u2019t invest in bonds and project finance at a 100x leverage (what we have currently). The only things that came from a 100x leverage were LTCM and the Global Financial Crisis. ",
