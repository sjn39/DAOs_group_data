                    "content": " Executive Summary  Successes  Transition of power with LongForWisdom stepping down in June. Responsible use of budget, keeping up with a tradition of reasonable budgeting, and getting closer to intended spending levels while not overspending. Outreach and public profile, getting connections in the Governance space that will prove beneficial for MakerDAO for many years to come.   Failures  Straying from Quarterly focuses, specified below. Mismanaging Human Resources and leveraging team talent. Taking on too much, losing sight of the GovAlpha Mandate.   Spending  Overall Q2 spend was 218,362.38 DAI compared to a total budgeted amount of 257,428 DAI. Excluding our Contingency Buffer, we underspent by 2.45%, showing a continual trend of improvement in budgeting while still being fiscally responsible. We overspent on \u201cPeople\u201d but in an acceptable range of 6.1%. While GovAlpha has taken on more assignments that might lead to this trend continuing, we are confident it will not represent a threat to our strong history of responsible budget use. We will be returning 39,065.62 DAI from this quarter as well as ~1,080 DAI worth of ENS and REQ tokens.   Focuses for Q3 (Present Quarter)  Major: Governance Audit + Analysis Minor: Maker Operational Manual Updates + Delivering CatFlipLike Status UI   Conclusions  Many of the failures represented here are a direct result of a tendency to attempt to collaborate when asked on a wide variety of projects off-mandate. In many ways, this quarter\u2019s performance demonstrates a misaligned focus on the \u201ctrees, rather than the forest.\u201d Obsessing over the day-to-day stresses resulted in overall deliverables failing to materialize. The team we have assembled at GovAlpha is truly top-notch. When given a light direction and touch they showcase some of the best values of the DAO. More time needs to be spent cultivating their talent and less with facilitators taking on laborious tasks that prevent proper mentorship.   Analysis  Last Quarter\u2019s Focuses  Major Focus: Prioritization Voting Algorithm  Result: Qualified Falure As we announced we would, GovAlpha attempted to put up a continual priority voting system for MKR to express the magnitude of their desire for various projects within the DAO. You can view the Technical Resource Deployment and the Collateral Class priority polls. We think we failed to deliver this system.  Background on Development A lot of the work on Prioritization Polling was done in April. After proposing a draft before Devconnect, Patrick, LFW, and I had a great call breaking the draft down and coming up with a \u201cbetter\u201d system. The implementation of the polls required input from several parties and some development from the Data Insights Core Unit. We didn\u2019t seem to find a fair way to get items added that didn\u2019t upset Core Unit Facilitators or disenfranchise the MKR holders whose opinion we were trying to seek. This led to over a month of unnecessary delay, pushing the deadline for accomplishing this task ever closer. Ultimately, the polls were pushed to be listed on June 6th, despite internal trepidation that the work wasn\u2019t ready to go live. The model was presented on two Governance and Risk Calls (1,2).  Identified Issues It became immediately apparent that our desired number of options in the Technical Poll (and arguably the same for the Collateral Class Poll) was not congruent with the number of items voters felt they could accurately prioritize. Additionally, we found that the items selected were by and large the ones most near completion, suggesting either biased participation or poor selection of options. By overloading governance participants with a long list of vastly different items to prioritize, governance participants were jogging uphill. In retrospect, a workshop for delegates about how to weigh different priorities and link relevant resources might have been helpful. Several delegates contacted me asking if they really \u201chad to\u201d vote in the polls (they were included in delegate compensation making the motivation for participation quite high). This reflected both the underwhelming presentation of the polls and their perceived uselessness.  Underlying issues Lack of Confidence: The fear that the polls would stir more controversy than bring clarity has been palpable, and so I was not confident that the presentation of our idea was actualized in the implementation. While being confident in an idea is no guarantee of its success, becoming personally convinced an idea is worth implementing is often the first step to enacting change. Lack of Buy-in: By seeking outside Facilitators late in the process and failing to secure support from the Recognized Delegates, it became somewhat apparent when June arrived that this vision was going to fall short. We feel that we posted the polls without key stakeholders being assured of their value. A more responsible action would have been to delay the project until we found better ways to deploy it. Issues with Tooling: By underselling this project to DUX and coming to Data Insights late in the game, this initiative was further set up for failure. The project would have been much stronger with a clear presentation of that Data. DUX was willing to help but we decided not to ask for any changes to be implemented in the voting portal until the initiative was visibly supported. Likewise, the updates on the vote were not processed, in part due to the lack of meaningful changes in the results, but also driven by issues displaying the ranked-vote choice flow. The tooling from Data Insights was excellent when it worked and we are confident that if we had invested more in this collaboration, the graphs displaying the vote transfers would have been more robust. That same tooling has since been useful in exploring other Ranked-Choice votes, without our follow-up.   Minor Focuses:  Formalizing Recognised Delegates Result: Qualified Success When the Delegation program was first introduced to Maker, we leaned into the permissionless nature of the delegate set-up and chose not to codify Recognized Delegates with a MIP. We have additionally participated in several workshops and training with delegates, suggesting the DAO is starting to leverage these participants more in the workforce. While it was important to us not to tie down what it means to be a delegate at Maker, by formalizing the role and focusing on paying professional salaries we could ensure delegates bring a beneficial lens to Maker Governance. After nearly a year of the launching of the program, we were finally able to draft a MIP set that was ready to be submitted by the end of July. This did come later than we intended, but we were still happy to deliver the ideas after hardening them for such a long time. The Delegate MIP Set ratification poll ended up being unsuccessful, but we hope that our work clarifying what we learned from the first year of delegation at Maker will not go to waste. Since this MIP set was voted on in Q3, the results will be further discussed in the Q3 Quarterly Report. While we onboard more delegates into the system we will benefit from new and refreshed perspectives on the pain points and joys of being a delegate at Maker.  Experimenting with Off-chain Incentives Result: Fair Performance Off-chain incentives are important for creating a truly decentralized and accessible organization. With so much work to be done with formal proposals and community contributions, we require a robust system that rewards impactful efforts to improve aspects of the DAO/protocol. We released our changes to improve Off-chain Incentivization in the Maker Community and are happy to report we were finally able to pay out a proposal bounty (albeit technically in Q3). This minor focus was a long time coming after making the decision not to increase SoureCred funding in Q4 2021. Our talks and challenges in finding motivated governance participants have fueled more focus on this area of incentivization. While we might have liked to spend more time tinkering with incentives, the cutback to SourceCred spending was a good decision for the community. As proposal bounties become more prevalent, we expect this incentive structure to play a much larger positive role in bringing new ideas to the table.  Spending Sources: GovAlpha CU 2022 to '23 Budget GOV-001 Public Accounting Detailed Budget Breakdown by Quarter  GovAlpha Quarterly Review Q2 2022  Actual versus Budget  1081\u00d7568 13.1 KB   Note: This graph includes GovAlpha\u2019s Contingency Budget Line Item to better represent the use of our funding stream.  Spending Breakdown  910\u00d7718 309 KB    Spending Conclusions For Q2 2022, we were able to anticipate our spending more accurately. We very slightly underspent, using 2.45% less budget than expected (excluding contingency funds). Once again, we did not need to spend any of our budgeted contingency buffer.  People: overspend  +6.1% = 7,399.33 DAI Facilitators: underspend, Contributors: overspend  This time, we ended up spending 6.1% more on People than what we had originally planned. This is in part due to having @LongForWisdom stepping out as Facilitator in June and stepping in as Contributor - switching the sourcing of funds from the Facilitator Salary category to the Contributor Remuneration. This also required other CU contributors to take on more hours to make up for the reduction in hours from LFW. Meanwhile, other contributors have been gaining experience and dedicating more hours. Some contributors\u2019 hourly remunerations were raised.  Programs: underspend  -5.55% = -4,860.55 DAI Governance Incentives and Status UI = underspend Others= overspend  For the Programs category, we spent slightly (5.5%) less than what we planned for. Resources were internally redistributed. We ended up spending much more in our \u201cOthers\u201d categories primarily for the MIPs Portal maintenance but also the forum administration test pilot. When the SourceCred off-chain incentives were modified, our Governance Incentives were reduced.  Travel:  -80.3% = -8,030.00 DAI  Once again, the resources intended to cover Travel expenses were largely unused. Devconnect Amsterdam in April was the only event that GovAlpha participated in. We are hoping to start using these resources in the future; ideally, GovAlpha contributors will be able and willing to participate in these events more and more.  Gas:  100% of the 5,000 DAI budget spent  Due to the falling ETH price, we decided on 2022-06-20 to spend the full 5,000 DAI Gas budget for the quarter on ETH. Transaction here. This bought us 4.55 ETH (rounded up) at a price of 1,098.90 DAI/ETH. We expect this to fund our gas needs for the remainder of this budget period and possibly beyond, meaning that the gas budget for Q3, Q4, and Q1 will likely be returned to the DAO in full.  Budget Return GovAlpha will be returning 39,065.62 DAI to the Surplus Buffer for the unused budget from Q2. We will also use this opportunity to send the following tokens to the PauseProxy:  65.97 ENS tokens -  airdropped to the GovAlpha multisig as it has ownership of the govalpha.eth ENS domain. 139.10 REQ tokens - airdropped to @prose11\u2019s signing wallet as we use Request Network for distributing payments to our team.  We believe that these tokens are the property of MakerDAO and this is why we will be sending them to the PauseProxy. The value of these tokens is approximately 1,080 DAI as of 2022-10-04.  Q3 Focuses  Major Focus: Governance Audit + Analysis To effectively measure any improvements to governance at MakerDAO, we first need to determine a set of metrics that can be used to judge the effectiveness of Maker Governance. Now that we\u2019ve implemented much of the low-hanging fruit, and have witnessed stable and consistent MKR weight participation in proposals, we can spend the time required to do this properly. We will also review the effectiveness of governance thus far against these same metrics. We will then produce some forward-looking analysis of commonly proposed governance initiatives and estimate which would be most beneficial to governance in MakerDAO.  Minor Focuses  Maker Operational Manual Updates We\u2019ll take some time in Q3 to do an update and maintenance pass on the Maker Operational Manual. It\u2019s still early days for this platform, but we may schedule something like this roughly every six months to ensure that the information remains correct and accessible.  Delivering CatFlipLike Status UI We have been contracting with dSpot to produce a parameter-focused status UI that we\u2019re currently calling CatFlipLike, given that it\u2019s similar to the now-defunct CatFlip UI. There is still some amount of development still to go on this project before it can be considered complete. We expect an initial version to be released soon.  Conclusions and Final Words The year is already flying by and we apologize for the lack of communication from the CU as of late. During the mid part of this quarter, we were spending over an hour of facilitator time a week just to gather and put together our weekly updates. It has been and still is a very challenging transition period. Burnout of the workforce has already been mentioned in past reports as one of GovAlpha\u2019s failures. This quarter, we saw one facilitator step down and another take several unplanned days off due to panic attacks. Fundamentally, we can not deliver on the items of our mandate if our team is overworked and stressed out. After deep reflection, we have determined the cause of these issues to be our Core Unit\u2019s long-standing tradition of doing \u201cnecessary\u201d work outside our team\u2019s mandate. Managing the governance of the protocol and ensuring our contributors find fulfilling work that benefits the DAO is a tall enough docket on its own. By straying into other fields, we not only threaten the autonomy of other Core Units but erode the dependable nature of GovAlpha. We are not machines and cannot expect ourselves to reach out and tackle any problem that comes across our virtual desk. The lack of any meaningful deliveries on our Quarterly Goals is not a reflection of a lack of quality labor at GovAlpha. We have much to celebrate, as early teasers from last quarter\u2019s review have grown wings. We have a more functional (and pretty!) Dashboard than ever, our internal leaders have gone through training in running more engaging meetings, and we have persevered through a transition of power (in both directions!). GovAlpha remains committed to the mission of decentralized governance, and while it was a bit painful to see how far we strayed during this quarter, we are better off for reflecting on it. ",
