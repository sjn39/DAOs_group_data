Looks like the appetite for people minting day with a lower CR but a higher SF seems quite high. We do have a lot of headroom since the line for ETH-B is at 50 MM, but next onchain poll is 3.5 weeks away - so why not start preparing for that  Next onchain-poll will likely happen on January 11th and a lot of people might be half-active/in-active in the next weeks, so I thought it makes sense to start the signal right now  Pros  more fees collected more DAI in circulation   Cons:  increased exposure to ETH volatility   line adjustment Here are a few polling options with +50%, +100%, +200%. Please note that this is the IAM-DC, so if you are not familiar with the Instant Access Module - here is the MIP.     150 MM (+200%) 100 MM (+100%) 75 MM (+50%) 50 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will run until January 7th 14th and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary  Update As expected raising the ceiling might have significant impact on the exposed risk and therefor potentially on the SF as well. Keeping the poll open for another week. Please have a look at the discussion, especially at @Primoz comment. ",

At current debt exposure Risk Premium would be around 6%. Rates Group did propose SF increase to 5% for this reason last week and this should be implemented when executive passes. We\u2019ll monitor situation and react at next possible executive. We are noticing though that ETH-B users are a bit more risk taking versus ETH-A (apart from lower collateralization levels used, they also seem to be using less collateral buffer to protect against getting liquidated). Since the box parameter is only 15m, this might be becoming an issue. Potentially we should also revaluate if box of 15m is still appropriate. This limiting factor is probably one of the biggest hurdles right now that makes me a bit uncomfortable against increased portfolio risk exposures despite higher compensation from fees. ",

                    "content": "I don\u2019t particularly like increasing ETH-B DC at this stage to be honest. One reason is that until liquidations 2.0 are released we are relying on 15m box parameter which is very low considering current DAI debt exposure and this is particularly dangerous for ETH-B. I am not sure if we have good argument to increase box, but it would be very beneficial knowing that we have more support from keepers and increase it. Second reason is low Surplus Buffer and the outcome of the Poll where people aren\u2019t necessarily in favour of increasing it. We can\u2019t have Surplus Buffer representing 0.3% of DAI debt and meanwhile aggressively increasing debt exposure of both ETH-A and riskier ETH-B. Third, are we ok to come into situation where debt exposure to ETH-B increases towards 100m and then realize we need higher SF to compensate for risk? Are we going to be ok by suddenly charging 10% or more for ETH-B? We had similar situation with YFI-A and it didn\u2019t turn out good. Fourth, I know nobody wants to miss on new DAI mint, but ETH-B users could very well be same users who would use ETH-A otherwise. It is possible Maker is stealing users from Compound and Aave currently with ETH-B, but don\u2019t forget that Maker has OSM and others don\u2019t, so these people might prefer to use Maker even at slightly higher LR. This is only speculation though. Fifth and lastly, maybe we should just slightly press brakes during this insane growth. But it\u2019s me representing Risk so maybe I am too cautious for some. ",

I\u2019d also like people to have a chance to change their votes after the meeting. The poll was put up during the holiday break, and Risk (and me) didn\u2019t give it the priority it perhaps should have had until the new year, once lots of people had voted. This is largely my fault, in retrospect it might have made more sense to disallow signals over the holiday period as well.  Apologies for the last minute change of plans. ",

So it is obvious that we would need to select the option with the most votes. So far, this has only been done if this option got a majority - which is not the case in this signal.     Planet_X:  Actually @LongForWisdom is taking the decision mechanism highly seriously, it is just that the signal request has slightly too many options.   Actually I don\u2019t think it is about having too many options, it is about voters not really considering options that they are willing to accept as well (next to their preferred choice). This is exactly the same issue as we experienced on-chain as well: If you are not willing to compromise, the whole thing could resolve into \u201cstatus quo remains\u201d. I have to admit that the description of this poll was not really clear on that - apologies for that. Will try to do that better next time. I really don\u2019t like the habbit of \u201cvoting until I get what I want to have\u201d, but yes - there seems to be a majority for increasing the line for ETH-B. So here is my offer: If i don\u2019t get shut down I am going to set up a new signal with one option.

So this is something I\u2019m going to starting thinking about a little. I don\u2019t see a significant downside in preventing TL0 users from participating in signal polls. TL1 is easy to achieve with a small amount of effort, but I expect it will weed out those that are setting up new accounts solely to vote without commenting or engaging more deeply. The downside to this is that it requires the signal author to select the correct options. For this reason I don\u2019t think I want to make it a strict requirement (I can see people forgetting to set the option and I don\u2019t want to reset polls that have been up for a few days on those grounds.) I have no objection to signal authors limiting voting to TL1+ though. ",

The reason behind it is very simple: since I initially posted this signal request I got convinced that raising the line-DC for ETH-B is just not a good idea. The risks we are taking here weight a lot stronger than the additional benefits we get. I usually tend to be more on the \u201clet`s grow like hell!\u201d-side and I think I still am, but the reasons I heard from the risk-perspective changed my mind on that topic. All the DAI-from-ETH that we could get out of raising the line-DC from ETH-B can also come from ETH-A, there is an urgency exec running right now to raise the DC of ETH-A to 1B), so there are ways to move forward. While I was feeling responsible as being the initial creator of the signal, it does not mean that this topic is done. If there is someone willing to take over the initiative: please start a Signal on your own. I know how I would vote  Thanks for participating in the discussions, thanks a lot especially to @Primoz @hexonaut @LongForWisdom and @SebVentures for changing my mind and helping me on my decision ",
