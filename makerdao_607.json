These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.  Specific Goals  Clarify that a Core Unit can be offboarded in the same governance cycle as removing its budget and facilitator(s). Establish a standard for proposers to include detailed reasoning. Add an explicit Facilitator succession plan so that election by active Facilitators becomes a fall-back process.

This includes (but is not limited to) settling outstanding obligations to all contributors, settling any outstanding debts or current obligations of that Core Unit to third parties, orderly transfer of any intangible assets of the DAO to another Core Unit, and return of any DAI in excess of that needed to wind down activities in an orderly manner.\u201d   Who is determining the settling? Doing an accounting like this is going to be difficult and requires a trusted counterparty. In this case the counterparty may not be cooperative while being off-boarded.     GFXlabs:  MIPXXc4: Template for Offboarding Summary of reason for offboarding: State the argument for offboarding. Include proactive actions performed to help the core unit achieve its mandate, if relevant. Explicit deliverables and responsibilities: List deliverables and responsibilities from the Core Unit\u2019s MIP39 mandate, as well as any other specifically declared deliverables and responsibilities (link to source when possible). Implicit deliverables and responsibilities: List deliverables and responsibilities implied by the Core Unit (link to source when possible). Examples of unfulfilled deliverables and responsibilities: List examples of unmet or poorly executed deliverables and responsibilities. Possible remedy to avoid offboarding: Suggest a path to accountability for the Core Unit, so the offboarding proposal could be withdrawn. . (Optional)   A concrete example [here] (MIP41c5-SP3: Facilitator Offboarding (MKT-001) - #10 by MadShills).  An attempt to provide context, arguments, and possible remedies. Generally this was a well cited resource that helped third parties understand the broader rationale during the recent offboarding. It seems the general objective is to be charitable and avoid unnecessary conflict. As part of the process, the offboarding core unit should be required to respond to all principled and reasoned arguments and open issues presented within the MIP. There was no direct response or proposed remedies by MKT to the content of the context and arguments, which ultimately counted against both the CU and DAO. I would suggest that a core unit has 10(?) business days to respond in writing addressing the issues and their own proposed remedies. If the core unit fails to do so, it should be presumed to be a forfeiture. Just a thought but worth considering. One of the main issues with the MKT offboarding was they presumed community support and failed to respond to any of the issues, or offer any remedies of how the issues would be addressed. Mandating a reply is one way to create a serious process for petition and remedy. ",

                    "content": "    GFXlabs:  A Core Unit that has been offboarded should conduct all winding down activities within 2 weeks.   This one seems unrealistic; in practice it takes a lot of time to wind things down gracefully and it may be harmful to force the process. This period should, for example, be enough to create a reorganization plan, submit a proposal for a new core unit, and have it ratified. 4 months would be a more reasonable term for this. The role of the interim facilitator is similar to the role of a curator or trustee in a bankruptcy process.     GFXlabs:  A budget modification proposal for a Core Unit made by anyone other than a member or facilitator of that Core Unit may only be to reduce budget to 0, and may not be voted upon until the earliest of:  All active DAI budgets to the Core Unit have been fully disbursed. Two months from RFC submission\u2026 Explicit endorsement from the CU\u2019s facilitator or Interim Facilitator, in which case regular rules apply with regard to the RFC period.    RFC submission here is ambigious. I\u2019m not 100% sure even what is intended: the RFC submission of the original proposal to offboard or one of the CU MIPs? I\u2019m assuming the former. I\u2019m also not sure if the Interim Facilitator\u2019s role here is proper or even well-defined at this point: An Interim Facilitator appointed based upon a succession plan must be a current or former member of that Core Unit. \u2013 So this would be likely be a trusted ally of the Facilitator\u2026 but somewhat up to chance\u2026 if there is a conflict it should not be up to them to make the RFC period a month longer. Second step would then be to suggest another candidate, or, fall back to the Fallback Decision Process. This makes sense in the case an off-boarding is already decided, but it makes no sense to make delegates the proverbial prisoner of the facilitators here. More fundamentally, I think it would be a mistake to make the RFC period of an off-boarding MIP longer than the usual. In fact we should probably make it shorter. The RFC period is a period of crippling uncertainty. If there is a conflict going on, \u201cbleeding the core unit dry\u201d over 2 long months during which political games can be played is a very harmful thing. Once the off-boarding MIP is published, that is the official no-confidence vote, and it should be dealt with as swiftly as possible. It is almost an emergency situation. I suspect the intention here was to provide more time for remediation, but extending the RFC period is not the right way to do this, in my opinion. We\u2019re confusing involuntary off-boarding with feedback and remediation here. Instead, efforts should be made to make involuntary off-boarding a rare exception:   Organize better feedback and evaluation processes. Create transparent performance metrics. Off-boarding should never be a surprise.   Provide the possibility for delegates to send an official warning. This official warning would signal to a CU that their performance has not been up to expectations and that they should make immediate efforts to improve their performance in order to avoid off-boarding. This official warning is important because it means that delegates do not want to proceed with off-boarding, and it separates this signal from an official off-boarding procedure. So it doesn\u2019t create the uncertainty that an ambiguous \u201coff-boarding unless maybe you promise to change\u201d procedure creates.   In the event of a repeated negative evaluation, a voluntary off-boarding should still be encouraged. And it should be a properly understood practice: how should the involved parties proceed in case the off-boarding is consented to by the facilitator?   For the same reasons:     GFXlabs:  Possible remedy to avoid offboarding: Suggest a path to accountability for the Core Unit, so the offboarding proposal could be withdrawn. . (Optional)   I would remove this from the off-boarding proposal template. Once the off-boarding procedure is started, it should be assumed that all other options have been explored to no avail. (For the purpose of the text above, read \u201cdelegates and MKR holders\u201d everywhere I mentioned delegates.) ",

Involuntary offboarding should never happen in practice, except under rare and unfortunate circumstances. It is problematic for both the DAO and CU when this happens. Offboarding should be disentangled from performance management which has its own challenges, as Wouter and Frank both note. Involuntary Offboarding is the end of the line, not 3/4 of the way. A standard unwinding term for all CU is ideal. Such a term can be forgone at the discretion of the core unit, but something like this is even handed and fair. It is also likely to achieve the best outcome for both parties. A standard term respects the autonomy and challenges core units face. It also produces business good will in the event of an involuntary offboarding. ",

This will allow the DAO to identify problem areas, improve the work culture, and opportunities to improve the retention of core unit team members.    These are points the Maker Talent CU can probably address. Agreed that exit interviews are important to collect the data for improving retention. But this applies to any situation where a DAO member leaves. Moving CU members in a different role, or rehiring in another CU should often be preferred. I\u2019m not sure if this aspect needs to be defined in a MIP.

Agreed that these should typically not be accessed by delegates or MKR holders as it would constitute too much micro-management. The roadmaps, milestones, and status flags as presented on  the most recent G&R call seem to be closer to the level of granularity that should be reported imo. This goes well with two other initiatives that SES is looking into: our objective to kick-start an ecosystem performance dashboard, and the auditing & quality control track as one of our Q2 incubation tracks. Happy to provide more details if that\u2019s useful. But the point is that these elements would not be part of the proposed MIP. I don\u2019t believe they should be. ",

I think 3-4 months makes a lot of sense because:   I think that oftentimes the offboarding procedure will really be the offboarding of the facilitator, and we\u2019d ideally want to salvage the team and keep it operational, maybe after restructuring. (Once again, compare this to a company restructuring or bankruptcy with a trustee or curator taking over.)   I\u2019m assuming the interim facilitator takes over immediately when it comes to the operations of the CU in winddown. I\u2019m assuming this person is not an advocate of the old facilitator, but someone neutral. I\u2019m assuming the interim facilitator has control, maybe together with an auditor, over the CU\u2019s multisig.   You want to have the time available to propose a new core unit (maybe even multiple CUs) to potentially move team members to and ensure business continuity. CU proposals need 2 months to go through RFC and FS; if the timing is unlucky (just missed an RFC deadline), it takes almost 3 months.   Since it will often be difficult to find a new facilitator, have all the necessary talks, and since it takes time to nail down a mission, vision, and strategy for a new CU, one or two extra months doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable.   Many core units have 3 months runway in the operational wallet under full operation. So while it\u2019s in wind-down, it should be enough to cover 4 months in situations where it makes sense.   Last point: 4 months is the maximum. In many cases, I would expect the interim facilitator to wrap things up much quicker.   ",

Adding my two cents to the discussion by underlining Robert\u2019s statement. At DUX, for example, we use a set of tools (eg. Discord, Shortcut and GitHub) in our day-to-day work\u2014the contents of these tools would not make sense to external stakeholders without relevant context. Providing this context would create a LOT of overhead for the team which would eat away our efficacy as an engineering CU. Similar to Robert\u2019s approach at CES we use Canny to maintain an up-to-date overview of Epics we are working on (or planning to), and this overview is accessible to anyone. In addition we provide quarterly roadmap updates in high detail. In my opinion this should be the abstraction level where CUs should provide transparency on their work and be held accountable by the community\u2014not at the lower abstraction levels of operational tooling (ie. a sprint board, project mgmt tools) ",

Appreciate the merging, made the conversations much easier to follow. But I do still see a few references to things that appear to be different in the PR copy and comments (how long dow CUs have to wind-down once offboarded, for example). Thanks for all the coordination work with crafting this document, btw. I know that is often the hardest part of the MIPs process (gathering shareholder opinions and aggregating agreed recommendations). ",

As a sneak peek for anyone curious, there is a list of action items, all the requisite changes, and copy for each edited MIP inside the workspace (thanks to blimpa). some adjustments we found along the way:  Clarity updates to MIP 38 and 39 Removing some clauses that try to pre-optimize for every state a Core unit can be in, instead of focusing on the actions to add/modify/remove Adjusting on the fly to the MIP40 revisions (thanks to @adcv and @Aes for the quick sync)  We spent quite some time thinking on MIP38, it looked a lot like this:  SPIDEY1920\u00d71920 131 KB  ",

We\u2019re closer to getting:  a PR with all changes here to the forum for feedback. a revised MIP4c2 (since we\u2019re editing MIP38 we have to include those changes in the outline) handling all the edge cases for offboarding a core unit, vs it\u2019s facilitator, and the involuntary vs voluntary triggers for those scenarios. Think flowcharts.    We\u2019re meeting again on Friday, happy to open the call to anyone who asks for the link.
