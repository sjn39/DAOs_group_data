DAI is battle tested, has weathered multiple downturns without loosing its peg, its market position is strong but this type of threats should be taken seriously. I see GHO\u2019s competitive advantage being that customers benefit from their asset collateral continuing to earn yield as opposed to Maker Vaults where collateral remains uninvested. The demand for this type of setup continues to grow, users are realizing that there are potential yield opportunities to be earn from the locked collateral, and in the current setup no one benefits from idle ETH, WBTC, etc. ",

As I understand  it, his position is: First, to clarify and reduce the core and complexity of Maker such that it has minimal real world entanglements and tail risk. Almost all agree with reducing the core to \u201cRai +\u201d Second, there is a massive investment in new structures to expand existing business lines and develop new ones. This would likely be in excess of current budgets. In a way, the proposal establishes a clear vision and clarifies the boundaries of where protocol aspects lie. From there, resources are redistributed to achieve this new vision and the associated objectives. Contributors to these new structures would also have additional incentives tied to their personal performance, making the structure more charitable and generous to individual contributors and core units. With the \u201cMetaDAO\u201d portion there seems to be division on the extent to which Maker should support these associated businesses and capital buffers. In all reality, Maker would need to be seeding the initial structures, as they have particular affordances (requirements) best met by Maker where the protocol has the greatest potential gains and upside (as opposed to a third party). Once they have been proven out, having other ecosystem players supporting and developing businesses is more feasible. ",

If Aave begins to take an anticompetitive stance (eg. materially disadvantaging DAI via parameter changes such as raising reserve factor or purposefully making DAI less usable within the Aave money markets), we may be forced to launch our own competing liquidity protocol to ensure DAI can continue to access the market for longer tail collateralized lending on an equal basis. I think this would reduce Maker\u2019s focus (even if we found an incentive compatible way to spin the new liquidity protocol out into a metadao) so I would prefer to avoid this. I have similar concerns about the forthcoming Compound v3 protocol, which as described features a single borrowable asset per market. Will DAI be available to borrow on Compound v3? I\u2019m hoping we can maintain collaborative relationships with other defi protocols over the long term, but we should also be prepared for a war of attrition if other protocols force the issue. ",

As an OG Aave community member and developer, main architect of GHO and collaborator through both individual contribution and BGD labs, i would personally oppose any anti competitive stance towards other stablecoins, especially DAI which aligns with my ideals of decentralization and has been an inspiration for me from a technical and organizational perspective. I cant talk for the whole Aave community of course but i believe GHO can grow alongside DAI and other stablecoins and help bringing true decentralization and censorship resistance to stable assets, while maintaining the position of Aave as the protocol to use to borrow any stablecoin, not only GHO.

At this point, Aave & Maker has experienced real synergies for years in DeFi. We worked together, we know each other, liquidity protocols such as Aave helped DeFi grow from a sub B$ market to what we have now, offered DAI holders new pathways of liquidity and yield. As emilio pointed out: there\u2019s absolutely no point for Aave to take a \u201cGHO-maximalist\u201d approach for the aave market stablecoins, other actors in defi seem to aim for that and it\u2019s up to them. there\u2019s according to governance 3 new stablecoins joining Aave versions on several networks, it would be a bit weird to do it if the \u201cbig plan\u201d was to compete (note: we\u2019re defi too, big plans are decided in governance forums just like you guys.). My personal opinion backed by market data is that synergies are the best-self interest strategy for DeFi protocols to increase overall ecosystem stability, liquidity, attractivity, and resilience. I think our previous inter-protocol cooperation with the D3M is a good example of this, more liquidity for Aave, better rates for users more revenue for Maker. We think to put this in simple words that GHO helps DAI and DAI helps GHO. GHO being a collateralized-based asset, it is reinforced and reinforces other decentralized stablecoins. a simple example, if GHO is over peg, minting DAI to short it (a new PSM?) helps it to restore peg and provide maker users with opportunities. The same applies both ways. GHO and DAI together are alongside USDC on the centralized part of things a perfect match to always have strong ways to balance a stableswap pool. That means we can expect more liquidity, volume and fees overall. With GHO, Aave wins, but Maker also wins and so curve, convex & other DeFI protocols. In short, DeFi wins and users win. Let\u2019s work together. ",

Regardless of the levels of aggressiveness that may exist between the two protocols, at the end of the day there will always be a tendency to favor your product and community, and that\u2019s not bad, that\u2019s how it has to be. Perhaps my position is quite radical, but I still consider and defend that Maker has to have the entire line of products mentioned in the original Post and we will also post to other forums that we only copy the model for continuous collaboration  I\u2019d rather be a Warrior in a Garden than a Gardener in a war.

I am personally dedicated (and I see same takes within the overall Aave Community) on continuing the collaboration between Aave and MakerDAO communities. Similar to the D3M module that I proposed back in 2021, we are always excited to find new innovation to support the growth for both DAI and GHO. I will also not support any anti-competitive measures on Aave governance against DAI and rather see more growth for DAI across all the Aave markets. Excited also to jam with the Maker community on ideas to empower both of the communities  ",

Let\u2019s remember the monopoly that USDC has (I don\u2019t like the exposure of DAI to it) BUSD with Binance and USDT (no comment) if we increase more the exposure of decentralized currencies similar to DAI it would not be a long-term benefit to increase the liquid to these coins? I support the simple fact that important representatives of AAVE highlighted to clarify some things, what I would not approve of is that it is just words and there is no contract or legal public agreement And the second I get it from the article posted on the forum It is a parameter that I understand serves to increase the exposure of GHO in the protocol seems very good to me I quote verbatim: A discount model for GHO \u201cThe initial implementation of GHO includes a discount strategy mechanism. The initial discount strategy allows Security Module participants (stkAAVE holders) to access a discount on the GHO loan rate. In the first implementation, the The strategy will establish a certain amount of discounted GHO per stkAAVE supplied, and a discount in interest rates that can vary from 0% (no discount) to 100% (full discount)\u201d This measure, understanding that it is to feed the liquidity of GHO and that it will be subject to a change by the DAO participants, but despite seeming good to me, if it becomes permanent, would it not lower the exposure of DAI in AAVE? If the participants of the DAO want to have it forever, wouldn\u2019t that be a risk model? For my conclusion, I like knowing that we all have the same vision of decentralization I see the comments in both forums and we all love anticompetitiveness, also I love that decentralized stablecoins take a much more important role than centralized ones. If everything in GHO turns out excellent, could you think of a collateral proposal GHO - DAI? Or lower the exposure in a future of USDC having an agreement with AAVE and GHO? It would be lovely, of course speaking if everything turns out excellent ",

So, they intend on using DAI\u2019s minting method, almost 1 to 1; but on the other hand, do they serve the same markets? In terms of DeFi adoption, yeah probably. But at the token generation level, DAI is typically minted by large or institutional investors. GHO will likely be more free-reign, with smaller holders collateralizing assets to mint it. Even with over-collateralization, they\u2019ll be taking on a massive chunk of smaller, riskier loans.
