Both projects were represented by AmaZix (thenextweb) Amazix has desperately been trying to cover its traces but hey, the damage was so big that it\u2019s near impossible. I am sorry to have to share this anonymously, but hey, I think it\u2019s fair play considering their attempt to cash grab a $1.1 million from a high profile DeFi project ! Really ? are you f***ing serious ? There is a LOT to be said about this rather disguting company. I let you do your research on Reddit, Bitcointalk and other popular ICO forums from 2017-2018. Just ask anyone who was in the space back then and you will hear rather appalling stories. I hope this thread along with the others will make Amazix and its staff look at themselves in the mirror and never come back again. ",

However, here are the facts, and if you read any of the articles covering the news you are referring to, it clearly stated that Amazix pulled away from the project. In fact, Amazix resigned the accounts in May 2018, a year well before the \u201cexit scam\u201d took place in May 2019. \u201cAmaZix had originally been coordinating the efforts of individual ICO promoters (bounty hunters) but severed ties with RepuX and JoyToken after disagreeing over how the promoters should be compensated for their efforts. The ICO teams claimed it was changing how much bounty hunters would be paid because the token sales performed worse than expected.\u201d Please note that when we pulled away, it was over some general mismanagement about how the bounty hunters community was going to be treated: at that point in time, in fact, there were no signals of what was going to happen one year later. Still, Amazix values very seriously any commitment the projects make to the blockchain and token holder communities: if these projects break their promises, in this example, to bounty hunters, we decided that RepuX and JoyToken couldn\u2019t be held liable for other commitments. And, so we resigned the accounts giving a public announcement. In general, our history shows how much we aim to protect the community from any fraud. The following are just a few examples of that: AmaZix Assessments From the very beginning, all our potential customers went through a rigorous, multi-stage assessment and due diligence process, called \u201cAmaZix Assessment\u201d. With our deep experience of the crypto space, our team of analysts has completed deep dives across hundreds of crypto projects. This process is mandatory, we publicly provided a broad overview of such a process in this blog post: medium.com/amazix/amazix-assessments-ee35fb463e85 AmaZix Bot In July 2019, we decided to offer for free to any telegram community the standard version of our AmaZix Bot, which we created to add a protection layer against all of the spammers, scammers, fake links and dangerous files putting at risk our clients\u2019 communities. A fully customizable version was also made available for a small premium, for those groups that were not yet ready to have our top-notch 24/7h moderation team taking care of their community.

I was frankly disappointed that more people who knew the reality first hand didn\u2019t also speak up. There\u2019s a saying that in a democracy [DAO], people get the government [Core Units] they deserve. So I also have to say that this is a pretty uncharitable, selective, and disingenuous attempt at a hatchet job on AmaZix. Whether or not they\u2019re the right choice for marketing MakerDAO, this is not the way to go about making the argument, and not something I want to see as part of Maker\u2019s governance process.
