                    "content": "Overview Due to current market conditions, the DAI peg is still trending upwards, debt ceilings are being hit on the regular, and yet we still can\u2019t find enough collateral to satiate DAI demand, all while capturing little value to insure the system against future unforeseen downturn events. Many community members have made it clear that we are playing a risky game by allowing the Maker protocol to take on this much risk while not making sure to backstop the system. Therefore I propose the creation of a new ETH vault option (ETH-B) to begin collecting a risk premium to be added to Maker surplus as well as giving us the ability to test different system parameters. Since we don\u2019t want to rock the boat on current vault holders by raising the risk premium and possibly hampering DAI creation, I think that by creating ETH-B we can keep ETH-A at 0% and halt further DC raises, while simultaneously adjusting ETH-B liquidation ratio, debt ceiling, and risk premium. This would also give us the benefit of A/B testing different parameters to see what works best and adds an additional tool to our arsenal. Pros:  Allows MakerDAO to begin collecting risk premium from ETH vaults to insure the system Allows MakerDAO to test different parameters to see what works (A/B testing)  Cons:  Vault users may choose not to mint more DAI if stability fees are higher Lower Liquidation Ratios may put more risk on the system in the event of another liquidation event Removes DAI liquidity from the market if risk premium is too high  Should we add ETH-B as a vault option?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     What starting Liquidation Ratio should ETH-B have?     150% 145% 140% Let Risk Team decide Abstain     0 voters     What starting Risk Premium should ETH-B have?     .25% .50% 1% 2% More than 2% Let Risk Team decide Abstain     0 voters     What starting Debt Ceiling should ETH-B have?     10 Million 20 Million 30 Million 40 Million 50 Million Let Risk Team decide Abstain     0 voters     These polls will run until Friday, July 31st, 12pm EDT. If consensus is reached I will push for it to be added to the following Monday\u2019s on chain governance poll. If you can think of any other pros/cons I will be sure to add them to the overview. Looking forward to hearing the communities thoughts on the matter! Edit: Poll extended until Wednesday, August 5th in order to give facilitators time to review. ",

In that scenario we would have to absorb the loss without any stability fee to offset it. If there were no liquidations I would include a stability fee to offset the risk and increase to 500% the CR on a tight DC, depending on the evolution of eth price change the CR of the marginal loans to cover ourselves of eth price spikes. Also from a user perspective probably it would be a conservative way for a user to go long on eth or use the dai as an actual loan rather than deposit it in another defi dapp for yield farming. ",

This requirement is documented in the practical guide. The reason for this is that it gives the facilitator(s) time to review the poll wording, and suggest any changes on Thursday, before the poll can be submitted on Friday to start on Monday. It also means that the facilitators don\u2019t need to submit polls during the weekend. ",
