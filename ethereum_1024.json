The key bit of innovation is requiring the signer of a metatransaction to deposit some collateral that would be burned if they attempt to cheat by signing too many transactions. I think this premise could be expanded to do cross-chain contract execution and similar. I\u2019m not sure if this approach exists already. There seem to be limitations and potential solutions that I have outlined in the readme.    GitHub    web3masons/MetaSwap Cross-chain swaps with metatransactions.
