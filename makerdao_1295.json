                    "content": "When do you think the US Treasury will launch a USD digital currency (CBDC)? Essentially disintermediating financial instutions as a currency distribution channel would be a game changer and potentially an existential threat to TradFi\u2019s funding. With the massive collapse of UST, its safe to assume CBDC or stablecoin regulation is coming or maybe both. Imagining a world were both US CBDC and DAI coexist, I think DAI would have many more use cases in DeFi that I dont foresee CBDC will have given CBDC wallets will most likely require a formal account registration, aside of being a digital store of value and cheaper/faster payments. If CBDC\u2019s launch is succesful though that might mean strong demand for DAI/CBDC PSM in the future. Crazy to think about. Is there a CU or team in MakerDao that would be responsible for assessing the impact of CBDC? ",

Of course it has its negative side, decentralization can be in the background, but DEX will still exist and its use will increase, also eventually people who have a large capital will only use DEX\u2019s, smart money will not move in CEX\u2019s or CBDC. I will attach the following graphs to know the impact that can come.
