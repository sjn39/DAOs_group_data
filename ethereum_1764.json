                    "content": "Short Version: Ethereum Architect (EA) is a new role in Ethereum Community. EA keeps in mind most core projects in ethereum ecosystem with focus on their interoperability, performance and specific features. EA\u2019s role in a project is to integrate different modules into working product and compare similar modules to pick the most suitable one. EA is financially self-sufficient: you are able to earn money even if you are not part of any other project. In Ethereum Community EA takes care about core project\u2019s UX, interoperability and integrations and creates RFEs in that projects in order to push necessary improvements. In Ethereum Governance (Signaling) his role is to identify influencers (projects and developers). Ring of Ethereum Architects supports, summarizes and promotes community work done by its members. Long Version: Many of the ethereum projects are developer driven grassroot projects. Developers are acting independently and get revenue from community attention generated by their project. Moreover nobody in Ethereum likes hierarchies and external management, nothing can be enforced. We are like that cats, that don\u2019t like to be herded. All this is an ethereum-style development process, this is our \u201ceth-ish\u201d lifestyle . It has huge drawbacks. Ethereum Ecosystem is a patchwork of many loosely connected independent projects. There is no direct incentives for developers to spend their time working on interoperability and integrations into other projects. In old-school world there is a management for that, but we don\u2019t like it, we like to have it \u201ceth-ish\u201d. Therefore we don\u2019t have any role in our community taking care about seamless integration of the parts into one smoothly working platform. Ethereum Architect (EA) is exact the full-time role for that purpose: he/she \u2026  knows almost all sub projects in ethereum space (and makes his knowledge public),  \u2026 this includes project\u2019s features, performance, interoperability and future development.   proposes standard architectures and solutions, i.e. for external customer needs. creates a EIP\u2019s in particular projects to improve their interoperability and UX, based on own experience in customer\u2019s projects. represents customer needs in technical ethereum discussions. compares similar projects creating the \u201cbest-of\u201d lists. provides quality reports and promotes best devs or projects or makes list of their flaws public.  EA role meant to be \u201ceth-ish\u201d. It means an EA should not pretend to manage other people, but because of his broad knowledge of ethereum ecosystem and community, this role is quite influential. \u201cEth-ish\u201d means also working active and independently. It means also, the role is self-sufficient: as an Ethereum Architect you are able to earn money even if you are not part of any other project. EA is like a Software Architect but it is more, because EA actively takes care about ethereum as a platform in general. Moreover, he/she brings projects, developers and stakeholder together because of knowledge of the community and ecosystem. Because of wide knowledge of ethereum ecosystem and community, EA plays important role in Ethereum Governance (Signaling): EA identifies influential projects and people, which is essential to interpret signals. EA signals customer needs into ethereum community and project needs to each other. Any thoughts? ",

As an aside, I would re-think EIP categorisation to separate Standard from DesignPattern.  A Standard MUST be stricktly followed by all implementors. Once released and implemented, it can\u2019t be changed. Therefore it needs cautios design and broad discussion.  (f.e.: ERC20). A DesignPattern is only a recomendation. It needs roughly consensus and can be changed later. The process should be RFC like.  Personally, I try to read and understand every new Standard, proposed in Ethereum Space, because it has lasting and general impact. Not the same about DesignPattern: I read them if I need them. Unfortunately, I am totally overhelmed by EIP proposals that pretend to be Standards but are DesignPatterns actually. They do not need so much timely attention, but they claim it. It is a pain and we need to target it, IMHO. Possibly by better categorisation for EIPs, applied by EIP editors. ",

We can all be so far down our silos it\u2019s difficult to listen for these, but our EAs are superstars and can bridge those connections. I think this honestly already happens quite well on crypto-twitter, but it\u2019s great to discuss the importance of this role especially as we scale. ",

Sorry for the confusion. One thing that would be helpful for us is as Ethereum Architects identifies projects, some of those could be analysed for integration. One example is Slockit.io gas voting. They are actively working on a voting mechanism never before seen. Luckily, we found them because Phil found them. Without this connection we may have never found this amazing project.

If you are in Berlin on 05-11.09.2018 let me know - it would be great to brainstorm in person.  I see two huge topics we can start with:   Book of Ethereum Reference Architectures and Design Patterns Organize a EIPs in a meaningful way.  Both topics are much needed for community and for ethereum adoption. Although final goal is very unclear at the moment, I could imagine a wa\u2026     ",

So looks like I will be able to present a preliminary report, but not a complete implementation. Anyway I have two topics to present already:  General presentations of the Ring of EAs as part of Meta discussion. Most ideas were already posted, but they need to be discussed. Decentralized tagging of EIPs as part of EA\u2019s Roadmap.  What formal steps from me are necessary to make it happen? ",
