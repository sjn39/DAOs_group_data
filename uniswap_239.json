            "body": "\nFranklinDAO Governance (previously PennBlockchain) and Kava Labs are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on Kava Network.\n\nKava Labs: @tommykavalabs\n\nSummary\n\nWe believe Kava\u2019s co-chain architecture will be highly beneficial to the Uniswap ecosystem. Furthermore, Kava\u2019s programs and newly implemented multi-chain Ethereum bridge positions the Kava Network for extraordinary growth in the next coming years. Through this deployment, both Uniswap and Kava can mutually benefit from operating within one another\u2019s ecosystems.\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.\n\nAbout Kava\n\nKava Chain is a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that implements a co-chain infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of both Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cosmos co-chain is highly scalable and allows Kava to connect to the over 35 chains and over $60B within the Cosmos ecosystem through its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It is optimized for Cosmos SDK developers and incorporates Cosmos\u2019 security and speed in Kava\u2019s infrastructure. The Ethereum co-chain supports EVM smart contract compatibility that enables Kava to execute the majority of current smart contracts. The Kava translator module allows both of these co-chains to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling developers to develop projects in their choice of execution environment.\n\nKava Labs is the developer team responsible for launching and maintaining Kava\u2019s native protocols. These protocols are the following:\n\nKava Mint: Kava Mint is a CDP protocol that allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and receive the Kava native stablecoin USDX. This loan usually has interest rates hovering between 0-5%. USDX can be used in the Kava DeFi ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\nKava Lend: Kava Lend is the borrowing and lending platform on Kava where users can supply or borrow tokens accepted by the network. Supply or borrowing tokens gives users the opportunity to earn APY.\n\nKava Swap: Kava Swap is a DEX protocol that allows users to swap tokens accepted by the network. Providing liquidity in these pools gives users the chance to earn extra APY.\n\nKava Earn: Kava Earn is a protocol that allows users to invest in complex DeFi strategies with a simplified supply/withdrawal system.\n\nKava\u2019s latest updates are Kava 11 and Kava 12, which both add additional improvements to growth incentives and network security. In terms of growth, Kava is launching Kava Liquid, which will be its first fully convertible staking protocol. Kava Liquid will unlock all staked bKAVA for use in DeFi protocols that operate on the Kava Network. This will be further supported by new protocol Kava Boost which will let users \u201csupercharge\u201d their Kava rewards with bKAVA. In terms of security, the Kava Network is forming the Kava Foundation to enhance network security and aid in critical infrastructure development. The Kava Foundation will determine how to use the Kava community pool to improve critical infrastructure on the network.\n\nProposal\n\nUniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would be immensely beneficial to the Uniswap Foundation, becoming an early pillar in the core infrastructure of a rapidly growing network. As a proven L1 network with a highly active user-base, the Kava network provides many benefits currently unrealized to the Uniswap network. Below are some critical improvements that Uniswap deployment on Kava would bring:\n\nDeveloper Incentive Programs: In early 2022, Kava launched its Kava Rise program, a $750M on-chain developer incentive program. The program funding model distributes rewards to developers building on Kava\u2019s Ethereum co-chain and Cosmos co-chain. The top 100 DeFi protocols on Kava receive pro-rata rewards distributions every month based on user activity on that protocol. Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would allow Uniswap projects to acquire a significant amount of this $750M allocation. Becoming active on the Kava Network early in this program\u2019s lifespan would enable Uniswap based projects to thrive on this rapidly growing network.\n\nEntry into Cosmos Ecosystem: Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would also enable access to the Cosmos project ecosystem. Cosmos is one of the most widely utilized execution environments, with Kava\u2019s use of its IBC protocol allowing access to the 35+ chains and $60B on the Cosmos ecosystem. Uniswap would gain access to this wide range of users and projects to improve its own ecosystem.\n\nUnlocking Liquidity: The recent Kava 11 update launched Kava Liquid, which establishes a foundation for unlocking all staked bKAVA on the network for use in protocols. Converting staked KAVA to bKAVA and supplying bKAVA to new protocols to boost APY improves the performance of all protocols on the Kava network. By deploying Uniswap on Kava, Uniswap protocols can take advantage of these new features to boost their own returns and increase their user activity.\n\nReinforces Ethos: Kava 11 and 12 recently launched new initiatives that encourage Uniswap\u2019s ethos of decentralization and security. Kava Liquid allows users to select validators and retain voting power even while staking. This ensures that users are still decentralized and possess their own voting rights. Kava 12 also announced its implementation of Cosmos DAO technology to assist in emission control for the Kava Community Pool. The community pool will be utilized to address critical infrastructure needs as the network continues to scale. Both of these elements support key characteristics of Uniswap\u2019s DAO ethos.\n\nSecurity\n\nGiven all the discussion and somewhat ambiguity around the bridging solution, we would like to proceed with first a snapshot check on the deployment onto Kava Chain itself, followed by that respective on-chain vote. Then, if this passes, we will have a snapshot vote to finalize what bridging solution will be used. Below, we highlight Axelar bridge, a solution proposed and recommended by the team. However, to be clear, this bridge will be voted on after (if) the deployment vote itself passes and then, incorporating community feedback, a snapshot vote will happen to finalize this.\n\nAxelar: Axelar is a decentralized interchain protocol implemented in Byzantine systems like that used in Kava. It contains a dynamic validator set that connects across a diverse set of consensus mechanisms with arbitrary payloads. Some of the core features of Axelar include:\n\nA permissionless set of 60 validators based on delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the Cosmos SDK.\nSecurity policies for validators like mandatory key rotations and network suspension function in the case of malicious activity.\nCompletion of over 20 audits and bug bounties to ensure the network is at its most secure.\nAxelar also provides a wide variety of other functions that serve interoperability needs. These include token transfers that allow the sending and retrieving of tokens across chains. It additionally includes general messaging passing that enables any function to be called on EVM chains from within dApps. Axelar also supports gas services that assist in prepaying the estimated cost for any generally messaging passing action.\n\nDetails for Incentivized Adoption\n\nUpon deployment, Uniswap would be enrolled into the $750M Kava Rise incentive program. This is a TVL based liquidity mining program, where each protocol on the Kava chain receives incentives in proportion to the amount of TVL on the chain. Current reward distribution is 1M Kava/month. The reward distribution amount will also increase as the ecosystem grows, based on governance vote. Rewards are distributed monthly, usually by the second half of the following month.\n\nBecause of this important deployment, the team is allocating at least $3M over the next 3 years to these Uniswap pools, from the Kava Rise incentive program. We expect the real allocation to be much higher over the year, depending on how much market share Uniswap attracts.\n\nAs an example, DefiLlama currently reports Uniswap v3 to have $66.94M TVL on Optimism.\n\nIf Uniswap had the same amount of TVL on Kava, we can do the math:\n\n($66.94M/$305.39M - total Kava TVL) =21.91% of total TVL on Kava\n\nUniswap would essentially be getting 21.91% of monthly rewards for that month, which is 1M Kava *21.91% = 219,100 Kava that month.\n\nThese rewards are paid out every single month, and the Kava Rise program is planned to run for several years. A weighted average of TVL reported by DefiLlama is used for calculation of rewards. There are no lock ups for the rewards. Rewards will be administered by the Kava Labs team.\n\nLicense Exemption\n\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Kava Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Kava provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Kava by Kava Labs]through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script 21\u201d albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.\n\nTimeline\n\nAfter passing the initial Snapshot Check to deploy to Kava EVM, we are looking forward to an on-chain vote, and granted that is passed, we will then have a snapshot vote to determine and finalize what bridging solution we will be using. Then we will be ready to deploy Uniswap v3 onto the Kava EVM network.",

            "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Avalanche ",
            "discussion": "https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-avalanche/20587",
            "body": "We [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s\u2013and not just on Ethereum L2s\u2013is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche\u2019s growing ecosystem.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nThe primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)\u2013indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.\n\nWe realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future\u2013but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.\n\n## Current State of Avalanche\nAvalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche\u2019s security.\n\nAvalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators\u2019 transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. \n\nIn comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. \n\nAvalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform\u2019s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)\u2013surpassing most other L1s\u2013and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.\n\nThe Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum\u2019s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet\u2019s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.\n\nIncreased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.\n\nSince launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche\u2019s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.\n\nPost deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche\u2019s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap\u2019s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.\n\nDue to Uniswap\u2019s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche\u2013although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. \n\nApart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers\u2013and maybe token holders\u2013will attain economic value from the protocol\u2019s increased usage. \n\n## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance\n\n### LayerZero Overview\nWe propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing\u2013which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.\n\nLayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others\u2013it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\n\nLayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\n\nLayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol\u2019s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).\n\n**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**\n\nMalicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.\n\n**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**\n\nUnlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink\u2013since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.\n\nLayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.\n\n**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**\n\nImmutability is part and parcel to LayerZero\u2019s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren\u2019t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole\u2019s $300M and Nomad\u2019s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs\u2019 future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.\n\nLayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).\n\n### Future Bridge Alterations\nFollowing deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup\u2013but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. \n\n## License Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the \u201c[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)\u201d. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\n## Timeline\nOnce the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.",

We propose to the Uniswap community to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\n* Scroll is an EVM equivalent zk-Rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum. Similarly to Uniswap, Scroll started out working closely with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community, for the community!\n* Deploying to Scroll bears many benefits, such as significant savings for users, user base growth, capturing the zkEVM market in advance, and fostering L2 native innovation.\n* We are aligned with Ethereum in our community ethos and vision. We are committed to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized, censorship-resistant and efficient future.\n\nGenerally, we believe that Uniswap\u2019s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized (financial) infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit and location. In the following we detail Scroll\u2019s architecture and mission. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community\u2019s questions.\n\n## About Scroll\nScroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent ZK-rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security.\n\nWe have been building in the open from day one, and collaborating on the zkEVM with the PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group at the Ethereum Foundation. Scroll is aiming at building the best possible solution to scale Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nScroll is compatible with Ethereum at the bytecode level, which is a major breakthrough in Layer 2 technology and brings huge benefits to the entire Ethereum community:\n\n* EVM equivalent: Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.\n* Developer friendly: Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n* Security: Scroll inherits all the features and security of EVM which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.\n* Decentralization: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is the only L2 that has committed to outsource proving before launching on mainnet. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem.\n* Advance Ethereum\u2019s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum\u2019s ultimate goal of \u201czkSNARK Everything\u201d. Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!\nZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling - a best-in-class Layer 2 scaling solution that is very cheap and secure. Scroll\u2019s vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to, thereby helping Ethereum scale without affecting the developer experience. We are live on testnet and will be launching on mainnet once our rapidly growing community of users, developers and auditors battle test the network.\n\n## Proposal\nBy launching on testnet, Uniswap has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk-Rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols (dapps) who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with an AMM. This is an opportunity for Uniswap to be a strong consideration for these applications.\n\nUniswap\u2019s multi-chain mission can be facilitated and accelerated by deploying on Scroll in the most seamless way currently possible on Ethereum. Uniswap is a uniquely important DEX in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that an L2 affords.\n\nUniswap on Scroll will:\n\n* Be able to offer high throughput, tps and low gas fees to cater to financial applications which are latency-sensitive such as Uniswap.\nConsolidate the project\u2019s position as an early mover and capture a rapidly growing market in advance as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to a zkEVM focus.\n* Integrate closely with Scroll\u2019s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to begin deployment within weeks of our initial testnet launch. Projects include Lens, theGraph, Covalent, Empiric, Blockwallet, Ledger, Safe, Orbiter and many more. Based on the excitement around Scroll and zkRollups broadly, we expect over a hundred projects to deploy on our permissionless testnet.\n* Propel L2 DEX innovation. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now. Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available.\n* Help foster an ecosystem fueled by creativity. Applications (Games, DeFi and more) that have not been seen till now will be deploying on Scroll and having  Uniswap on Scroll is mutually beneficial as novel use-cases will use swaps and liquidity pools. Everything from in-game economies to zk-dapps with swap features will have the opportunity to integrate with Uniswap, leading to a new era for application-layer innovation.\n\n## Bridge Security\nZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nCurrently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase.\n\nLast but not least, Scroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Its code security is closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation and Filecoin. We firmly believe that using such community standards is the most solid way to maintain the security of the codebase and the security of the entire system.\n\n## Timeline\nAfter passing the Temperature Check we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll testnet. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks.\n\nIt is important to us to be closely in touch with the Uniswap community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.",

                    "content": " Summary This proposal is created to further support the mission of a Multichain Uniswap. We propose to  the Uniswap community to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet.  Scroll is an EVM equivalent zk-Rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum. Similarly to Uniswap, Scroll started out working closely with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community, for the community! Deploying to Scroll bears many benefits, such as significant savings for users, user base growth, capturing the zkEVM market in advance, and fostering L2 native innovation. We are aligned with Ethereum in our community ethos and vision. We are committed to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized, censorship-resistant and efficient future.  Generally, we believe that Uniswap\u2019s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized (financial) infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit and location. In the following we detail Scroll\u2019s architecture and mission. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community\u2019s questions.  About Scroll Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent ZK-rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security. We have been building in the open from day one, and collaborating on the zkEVM with the PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group at the Ethereum Foundation. Scroll is aiming at building the best possible solution to scale Ethereum Layer 1. Scroll is compatible with Ethereum at the bytecode level, which is a major breakthrough in Layer 2 technology and brings huge benefits to the entire Ethereum community:   EVM equivalent: Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.  Developer friendly: Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.  Security: Scroll inherits all the features and security of EVM which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.  Decentralization: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is the only L2 that has committed to outsource proving before launching on mainnet. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem.  Advance Ethereum\u2019s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum\u2019s ultimate goal of \u201czkSNARK Everything\u201d. Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!  ZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling - a best-in-class Layer 2 scaling solution that is very cheap and secure. Scroll\u2019s vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to, thereby helping Ethereum scale without affecting the developer experience. We are live on testnet and will be launching on mainnet once our rapidly growing community of users, developers and auditors battle test the network.  Proposal By launching on testnet, Uniswap has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk-Rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols (dapps) who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with an AMM. This is an opportunity for Uniswap to be a strong consideration for these applications. Uniswap\u2019s multi-chain mission can be facilitated and accelerated by deploying on Scroll in the most seamless way currently possible on Ethereum. Uniswap is a uniquely important DEX in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that an L2 affords.

Consolidate the project\u2019s position as an early mover and capture a rapidly growing market in advance as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to a zkEVM focus. Integrate closely with Scroll\u2019s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to begin deployment within weeks of our initial testnet launch. Projects include Lens, theGraph, Covalent, Empiric, Blockwallet, Ledger, Safe, Orbiter and many more.

From various conversations we took away the following:  L2s are great when they focus on seeing a Uniswap deployment as a place for swapping tokens of apps native to their network. (Not as a way to pull TVL or LPs from other Uni instances.) For the testnet deployment, we should stick to just a Temperature Check for now and engage with the community outside of formal voting procedures (partially due to not needing more governance, but also to avoid governance fatigue) We should be careful now that we are aware airdrop framers will aggressively spam public channels We should deploy to our testnet and use that as an active testing ground  ",

                    "content": " Summary This proposal will grant a Uniswap v3 BSL exemption to the Nethermind team to deploy Uniswap v3 onto StarkNet mainnet.  StarkNet is a permissionless ZK-rollup that inherits security from Ethereum mainnet. StarkNet runs CairoVM, a virtual machine optimized for generating zero-knowledge proofs about L2 state transitions. Cairo is the high-level language used for writing smart contracts on StarkNet. Warp is a transpiler from Solidity to Cairo developed by a team at Nethermind. Nethermind has successfully used Warp to transpile the Uniswap v3 Core contracts to Cairo. Uniswap v3 Core is currently running on a local StarkNet testnet, passing all provided tests. The Nethermind team may use Warp to transpile the Uniswap v3 codebase and deploy it on StarkNet.   About StarkNet StarkNet is a permissionless, general-purpose Zk-rollup developed by StarkWare. StarkNet uses STARKs to securely generate and succinctly verify proofs about state transitions on the L2 and use those proofs to update the state root on Ethereum Mainnet securely. STARKs enable StarkNet state to be secured by Ethereum Mainnet consensus in a cheap and scalable way. StarkNet runs ZK-compatible virtual machine CairoVM, allowing applications on StarkNet high levels of computational scalability. Cairo, the high-level language native to the CairoVM, directly compiles into opcodes that can efficiently be evaluated in a ZK-circuit to generate succinct validity proofs about state changes.  Ecosystem StarkNet\u2019s unique approach to L2 scaling has unlocked an impressive level of computational scalability, and several novel features not native to the EVM. One of the most notable features is that StarkNet has native account abstraction(AA), meaning there is no distinction between EOAs and account contracts. There are several wallets and tools that utilize AA on StarkNet; AA has been praised as an essential feature in achieving mass adoption. The unique tooling and scalability enabled by StarkNet make it highly qualified for a Uniswap v3 deployment. There are 100+ projects currently being built on StarkNet, natively in Cairo. Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects building on StarkNet.  About Warp Warp is a Solidity to Cairo transpiler developed by Nethermind. While developer tooling around Cairo, StarkNet\u2019s native language, is rapidly growing, it is not yet up to par with the thriving ecosystem that encapsulates Solidity. Warp\u2019s goal is to enable developers to leverage StarkNet\u2019s computational scalability, unique features, and vast tooling for Solidity development. Warp is an efficient transpiler that can port over large codebases written in Solidity to Cairo to run on StarkNet. Warp passes all relevant semantic tests provided by the Solidity compiler. The Warp team has already transpiled the Solidity codebase of Uniswap v3 Core to Cairo. The transpiled contracts are running on a local StarkNet testnet, passing all provided tests. While this is a massive achievement for the Warp project, we expect to achieve far greater computational scalability through refinements to Warp and upcoming upgrades to StarkNet.  Timeline If passed, the community can expect to have Uniswap v3 fully deployed and supported on StarkNet mainnet by Q2 2023. The Nethermind team could be ready to deploy a transpiled and tested version of Uniswap v3 Core in Cairo on StarkNet mainnet today. While this deployment is entirely viable, some key optimizations are coming that will allow a StarkNet Uniswap v3 deployment to best enjoy the benefits of the StarkNet Ecosystem. Here is an outline of our current timeline and the reasoning behind it.   Will deploy our current version of v3-core in cairo on StarkNet public testnet in the coming weeks to allow community testing while we continue work simultaneously to improve the efficiency of Warp and UniStark.   Will deploy on mainnet after StarkNet regenesis (Q1 2023)  forced transactions from L1. L1 contracts can call L2 contracts without the possibility of censorship. I.e., censorship-resistant guarantees for cross-chain governance proposals gas metering: more dynamic fee market on StarkNet.    Transpilation, optimization, and testing of non-core contracts are underway.  We\u2019ve proven core functionality of Uniswap v3; we are currently working on all additional contracts that will support the v3 deployment, such as periphery     Warp\u2019s efficiency is still improving every day. Some key optimizations can be made to the transpiled Uniswap core contracts to better leverage the computational efficiency provided by Cairo and further reduce gas costs. Currently, Warp is working on being completely compatible with Cairo 1.   Cairo 1 has native support for basic constructs like loops and if-else statements without unnecessary variable copying. Once Warp targets Cairo 1, it can leverage the efficient native implementation of these features. Additionally, Cairo 1 adds support for recoverable errors used by the periphery contracts.   Development of an interface  StarkNet and CarioVM introduce unique tooling, such as Argent and Braavos Account Abstraction wallets. Nethermind is developing a usable Uniswap v3 interface for our StarkNet deployment to ensure users can easily interact with these contracts on day one as the official front end is being integrated.    Additional efforts to bring over Uniswap v3 liquidity managers, liquidity providers, and other critical infrastructure that will help the Uniswap v3 deployment on StarkNet thrive.   As Warp continues to improve, Nethermind will consider the benefits of a native Cairo rewrite of specific Uniswap v3 contracts.    Proposal StarkNet offers high computational scalability and unique design decisions, strictly secured by Ethereum consensus. With the advent of Warp, this proposal offers an easy and ethical route for Uniswap to leverage the StarkNet ecosystem and tooling. StarkNet is Ethereum aligned and believes the goals of our ecosystem align with that of Uniswap. Benefits to Uniswap:  Deploy Uniswap on a zk-rollup with a thriving and growing ecosystem. Reduced gas costs on Uniswap transactions. Expand beyond the EVM while still maintaining Ethereum alignment. Interoperability with a plethora of novel tooling being built on StarkNet. Potential v3 applications enabled by StarkNet\u2019s computational scalability, such as advanced oracle support, etc. Access to native account abstraction   StarkNet Security & Bridges Zk-rollups have been recognized as the gold standard for Ethereum scaling solutions. This recognition comes from the strong security guarantees of zk-validity proofs about L2 state transitions. Because of the strong cryptographic guarantees around zero-knowledge proof generation and verification, we can be sure the sequencer cannot propose invalid L2 state transitions. StarkNet allows for secure native general message passing between L1<>L2- leveraging validity proofs such that the sequencer, the actor responsible for L1<>L2 message passing, cannot lie about the state or create false messages from the origin chain. The only malicious activity possible is that the sequencer can stop sending messages, freezing L1<>L2 communication. After StarkNet regenesis, users can force L2 transactions from L1 without consent from the sequencer. The sequencer is currently run and maintained by Starkware but there is a plan to decentralize the sequencer role in 2023.  RFC on Uniswap\u2019s non-EVM-native Deployment Procedure As a contender for the first non-EVM-native deployment of Uniswap, we want to help define the alternative-VM deployment strategy of the Uniswap DAO through our proposal. Executing code on its non-native VM introduces risks that aren\u2019t present in native execution; there must be some translation between the original Uniswap v3 EVM bytecode and the bytecode of the VM being executed on. The translation can take place at different layers of abstraction: at a high level via transpiler or manual rewrite (see Warp; AAVE v3 Cairo aToken bridge); or at a bytecode level, like non-bytecode equivalent zkEVMs (see type 3/4 zkEVMs on Vitalik.ca). This additional risk should be accounted for through additional audits, bug bounty programs, beta periods of limited liquidity, or other means. We are asking the Uniswap community to use this proposal to analyze and define the risk tolerance and best practices around non-EVM-native deployments. The team at Nethermind is committed to being transparent about the risks associated with expanding Uniswap to non-EVM-native environments and defining appropriate measures alongside the Uniswap community. We hope to deploy Uniswap v3 on StarkNet and help the community set precedence for future non-EVM-native deployments of the codebase.  License Exemption This proposal will grant Demerzel Solutions Limited, the legal entity behind Nethermind, an exemption from Uniswap Labs Business Source Licence for the Uniswap v3 source code. Provided that this proposal is passed pursuant to the Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control process, Demerzel Solutions shall be able to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on StarkNet Mainnet, a layer 2 solution for Ethereum.

A beta periods of limited liquidity and a bug bounty commensurate bug bounty seems appropriate. I understand that DAI, USDT, and USDC with a $30k deposit cap are the equivalent assets for AAVE (from this post).

Do you know the proposal edit window length? As far as compensation. There isn\u2019t much precedence for this in Uniswap that I\u2019m aware of; then again there isn\u2019t any precedence for non-EVM deployments of Uniswap. Before properly answering this question it becomes really important to understand the risk tolerance of the community concerning development of Uniswap for other VMs.  Would the DAO be willing to fund (or jointly fund) a bug bounty program, or additional pro-security programs concerning this deployment? It\u2019s important to understand beforehand what the community believes is conditional for alternative-VM deployments as it will greatly impact the overall cost.  As mentioned in the proposal, Nethermind is prepared to deploy Uniswap v3-core on StarkNet using Warp today. While this deployment is completely viable, it is clear to us that additional resources would greatly boost the performance and associated tooling with a StarkNet deployment of Uniswap (Building fuzz testing for warp contracts; Warping over liquidity managers built on top of v3; improving efficiency; exploring native Cairo re-write of specific contracts and following audits; building a frontend supportive of StarkNet Account Abstraction wallets). It\u2019s also important to note that Nethermind is not StarkWare (the founding company behind StarkNet) or the StarkNet Foundation (the foundation which oversees the layer 2\u2019s development and decentralization). All current development on \u201cUniStark\u201d (our internal name for this project) is through grants we have received to develop the Warp tooling itself, not grants specifically for this Uniswap deployment. We are happy to continue through with a proper funding proposal once we have clarity on   Would responsibility for funding this work fall on the Uniswap Foundation, Uniswap Community, or even Uniswap Labs?   Is there any precedence for this that we are missing?   Does the community feel comfortable with a bug bounty program and capped liquidity period or are there additional costs we must consider to meet the Uniswap communities standards   If the community does not have strong opinions about point 3. We can draft an updated funding proposal on our own with expected cost of audits and required security features; though we wanted to have this conversation in the open, as it is likely to become precedence for future non-EVM-native deployments of Uniswap code. I think the only strong requirement before the community grants Nethermind a license to deploy is defining any contingencies unique to the security of alternative-VM deployments. This way Nethermind can be assured the community feels comfortable with the security of our deployment and can work separately to source funding to meet these requirements. ",

ETH/USDC; ETH/DAI; ETH/USDT are all high quality options. DAI is currently a capped asset on StarkNet, but the cap will potentially be moving up after regenesis. We will be in contact with the Maker community about making an ETH<>DAI pool on StarkNet. If we must commit for the purposes of this proposal, ETH<>USDC is the safest option I believe.     Nethermind will not be seeking a large level of compensation for this work. We would NOT like to make our deployment license for a limited liquidity pool contingent on funding.  ",

If Uniswap reps agree to deploy the project I think we also should consider also pre-authorizing an allocation of UNI from the treasury to co-fund a bug bounty as an additional incentive.   What we are voting on is only deployment of the v3-core onto mainnet, or does this also include periphery contracts? Unclear from the original proposal. Either way, this doesn\u2019t seem like it needs funding from us at this time.   We should be clear that this vote does not indicate any commitment of funding a native rewrite of Uniswap contracts in Cairo.

Only grants Nethermind an exception to the Uniswap v3 BSL.   This proposal will be for the deployment of all uniswap contracts that fall under the BSL license, including periphery. The deployment covered in this proposal will have a liquidity cap to reduce risk.   I\u2019m somewhat confused by the conversation of liability. This proposal (as stated by following comments) will be to deploy Uniswap v3 contracts with a capped liquidity of $30k (tentative number the community must agree upon). Is \u201cUniswap\u201d current liable for loss of liquidity on other uncapped deployments? i.e. a bug exploited in v3 on mainnet, ZK-Sync\u2019s bytecode interpreter introduces a bug, Optimisms proof system fails and funds are lost. I\u2019m not saying these are likely, but I\u2019d like to understand where liability falls in these scenarios- and what\u2019s legally actionable. I don\u2019t believe the BSL exemption implies anything about liability? If Uniswap has taken liability for all current deployments how does this change when license expires? From my untrained legal perspective, possibly Uniswap Labs assumes some liability when listing on their front-end (which this proposal does not cover).  Seems like a solvency fund would reduce concern- but I\u2019m starting to wonder if this is necessary given a primary testnet deployment, max loss capped at $30k on mainnet, and a Nethermind hosted frontend with proper disclaimers about risk.    The existing bug bounty program by Labs will not encompass this deployment; I was mentioning we would like to explore opening a separate joint bug bounty program (not encompassed in this limited liquidity deployment proposal)   ",

                    "content": "Hi Deven, This is a great proposal. Warp is a cutting edge technology that is vital for scaling Ethereum.  Today\u2019s zero knowledge virtual machines are highly optimized for prover time and efficiency.  While these optimizations are vital, they often come at the expense of strict EVM compatibility.   Transpilers such as Warp are the bridge between high-level EVM compatible languages like Solidity and zk-VM optimized languages like Cairo. This project is extremely important for Starknet, Uniswap, and the Ethereum community as a whole.  This isn\u2019t just a routine Uniswap deployment.   This is a cutting edge experiment that will have huge implications for the entire ecosystem -  especially for our understanding of how complex EVM based systems operate in other environments. Here are a few considerations that I think will be vital to success: 1.) UI/Frontend -  The v3 frontend is a large and complex codebase.  Most of the code is built on Web3 React.  The Starknet JS ecosystem is robust - but the code will require a lot of work before it reaches 1:1 parity.   What is the plan here? 2.) Account Abstraction - This will be vital for on-boarding the next billion users.  Starknet already has account abstraction.  It would be a huge missed opportunity if we don\u2019t fully explore account abstraction for this Uniswap deployment. 3.) Coordination - Crypto is all about building together and not in isolation.  For this project to reach its full potential, there will be many moving parts and lots of complex technologies overlapping.  We should think seriously about creating some public/community structures to coordinate across multiple experts, involve relevant teams, and ensure this deployment reaches its full potential. Huge kudos to the Nethermind team for bringing this proposal forward.  Crypto is getting fun again! ",

Deploying Uniswap V3 to a non-EVM would be an important milestone for the whole industry. We think there are two things that we would love to see get discussed more before going to a vote:  Front-end: how should it be built? (Risk disclosure should be there to signal that this is a very different implementation from the ones people are familiar with) Future uncapping: under what circumstances should the Starknet version be uncapped? (We recommend setting rough KPIs and expectations beforehand to alleviate future coordination costs.)  We are also happy to shelf these questions for now; so that, the nethermine team can start the development process ASAP. We can propose solutions to these important questions at a later date. ",

                    "content": "A lot of the above questions were answered and addressed in the StarkNet <> Uniswap Community Call  Frontend/UI- Nethermind will create a fork of the existing Uniswap frontend and adapt it to our StarkNet testnet deployment.   As stated in the call- we need to make some heavy changes to the existing use of ethers.js to adapt it to StarkNet ABI calls. For our testnet deployment we will simply be using StarkNet.js, but as we get closer to a mainnet deployment Nethermind will use a version of ethers.js it has adapted to translate solidity ABI \u2192 Cairo ABI. StarkNet Account Abstraction wallets like Argent and Braavos can be connected to this frontend and interact with our Uniswap StarkNet deployment. This is not a simple task, Nethermind will cover the cost of developement, and will be the main milestone before moving towards vote.   As for metrics for raising the liquidity cap we have no solid guidance from the community on this.   I\u2019ll initially suggest a 6 month period where the liquidity cap is moved from 30k \u2192 Uncapped incrementally each month: 30k \u2192 100k \u2192 200k \u2192 500k \u2192 1MM \u2192 Uncapped. Increasing this often can cause governance fatigue, but ensures a slow progress towards removal of the cap. 6 months is a long probationary period, would hope to get community feedback on if this can be shortened.   As for coordination- Nethermind and StarkNet are very much aligned with building out in the open. We will rely on the StarkNet, Uniswap, and broader crypto community to help battle test this deployment.   Having an accessible testnet deployment  and slowly increasing the liquidity cap and is a safe way to do this. We are relying on the Cairo community to try to break this thing in a somewhat informal way. While I\u2019m confident in the StarkNet communities willingness to support this initiative informally- we may still explore a bug bounty program. A bug bounty program would require capital from non-Nethermind entities (StarkWare, Uniswap). This contingency would greatly delay Nethermind\u2019s development, so it is being left out of this proposal. We\u2019d like to hear the Uniswap communities interest in supplying capital towards a StarkNet Uniswap bug bounty.  ",

                    "content": " Deploy Uniswap v3 to Kava EVM Network FranklinDAO Governance (previously PennBlockchain) and Kava Labs are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on Kava Network. Kava Labs: @tommykavalabs Stage Current Stage: Request for Comment Snapshot Check: TBD On-Chain Vote: TBD Summary We believe Kava\u2019s co-chain architecture will be highly beneficial to the Uniswap ecosystem. Furthermore, Kava\u2019s programs and newly implemented multi-chain Ethereum bridge positions the Kava Network for extraordinary growth in the next coming years. Through this deployment, both Uniswap and Kava can mutually benefit from operating within one another\u2019s ecosystems. We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. About Kava Kava Chain is a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that implements a co-chain infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of both Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cosmos co-chain is highly scalable and allows Kava to connect to the over 35 chains and over $60B within the Cosmos ecosystem through its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It is optimized for Cosmos SDK developers and incorporates Cosmos\u2019 security and speed in Kava\u2019s infrastructure. The Ethereum co-chain supports EVM smart contract compatibility that enables Kava to execute the majority of current smart contracts. The Kava translator module allows both of these co-chains to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling developers to develop projects in their choice of execution environment. Kava Labs is the developer team responsible for launching and maintaining Kava\u2019s native protocols. These protocols are the following:   Kava Mint: Kava Mint is a CDP protocol that allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and receive the Kava native stablecoin USDX. This loan usually has interest rates hovering between 0-5%. USDX can be used in the Kava DeFi ecosystem to earn rewards.   Kava Lend: Kava Lend is the borrowing and lending platform on Kava where users can supply or borrow tokens accepted by the network. Supply or borrowing tokens gives users the opportunity to earn APY.   Kava Swap: Kava Swap is a DEX protocol that allows users to swap tokens accepted by the network. Providing liquidity in these pools gives users the chance to earn extra APY.   Kava Earn: Kava Earn is a protocol that allows users to invest in complex DeFi strategies with a simplified supply/withdrawal system.   Kava\u2019s latest updates are Kava 11 and Kava 12, which both add additional improvements to growth incentives and network security. In terms of growth, Kava is launching Kava Liquid, which will be its first fully convertible staking protocol. Kava Liquid will unlock all staked bKAVA for use in DeFi protocols that operate on the Kava Network. This will be further supported by new protocol Kava Boost which will let users \u201csupercharge\u201d their Kava rewards with bKAVA. In terms of security, the Kava Network is forming the Kava Foundation to enhance network security and aid in critical infrastructure development. The Kava Foundation will determine how to use the Kava community pool to improve critical infrastructure on the network. Proposal Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would be immensely beneficial to the Uniswap Foundation, becoming an early pillar in the core infrastructure of a rapidly growing network. As a proven L1 network with a highly active user-base, the Kava network provides many benefits currently unrealized to the Uniswap network. Below are some critical improvements that Uniswap deployment on Kava would bring:   Developer Incentive Programs: In early 2022, Kava launched its Kava Rise program, a $750M on-chain developer incentive program. The program funding model distributes rewards to developers building on Kava\u2019s Ethereum co-chain and Cosmos co-chain. The top 100 DeFi protocols on Kava receive pro-rata rewards distributions every month based on user activity on that protocol. Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would allow Uniswap projects to acquire a significant amount of this $750M allocation. Becoming active on the Kava Network early in this program\u2019s lifespan would enable Uniswap based projects to thrive on this rapidly growing network.   Entry into Cosmos Ecosystem: Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Kava would also enable access to the Cosmos project ecosystem. Cosmos is one of the most widely utilized execution environments, with Kava\u2019s use of its IBC protocol allowing access to the 35+ chains and $60B on the Cosmos ecosystem. Uniswap would gain access to this wide range of users and projects to improve its own ecosystem.   Unlocking Liquidity: The recent Kava 11 update launched Kava Liquid, which establishes a foundation for unlocking all staked bKAVA on the network for use in protocols. Converting staked KAVA to bKAVA and supplying bKAVA to new protocols to boost APY improves the performance of all protocols on the Kava network. By deploying Uniswap on Kava, Uniswap protocols can take advantage of these new features to boost their own returns and increase their user activity.   Reinforces Ethos: Kava 11 and 12 recently launched new initiatives that encourage Uniswap\u2019s ethos of decentralization and security. Kava Liquid allows users to select validators and retain voting power even while staking. This ensures that users are still decentralized and possess their own voting rights. Kava 12 also announced its implementation of Cosmos DAO technology to assist in emission control for the Kava Community Pool. The community pool will be utilized to address critical infrastructure needs as the network continues to scale. Both of these elements support key characteristics of Uniswap\u2019s DAO ethos.   Security Given all the discussion and somewhat ambiguity around the bridging solution, we would like to proceed with first a snapshot check on the deployment onto Kava Chain itself, followed by that respective on-chain vote. Then, if this passes, we will have a snapshot vote to finalize what bridging solution will be used. Below, we highlight Axelar bridge, a solution proposed and recommended by the team. However, to be clear, this bridge will be voted on after (if) the deployment vote itself passes and then, incorporating community feedback, a snapshot vote will happen to finalize this. Axelar: Axelar is a decentralized interchain protocol implemented in Byzantine systems like that used in Kava. It contains a dynamic validator set that connects across a diverse set of consensus mechanisms with arbitrary payloads. Some of the core features of Axelar include:  A permissionless set of 60 validators based on delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the Cosmos SDK. Security policies for validators like mandatory key rotations and network suspension function in the case of malicious activity. Completion of over 20 audits and bug bounties to ensure the network is at its most secure.  Axelar also provides a wide variety of other functions that serve interoperability needs. These include token transfers that allow the sending and retrieving of tokens across chains. It additionally includes general messaging passing that enables any function to be called on EVM chains from within dApps. Axelar also supports gas services that assist in prepaying the estimated cost for any generally messaging passing action. Details for Incentivized Adoption Upon deployment, Uniswap would be enrolled into the $750M Kava Rise incentive program. This is a TVL based liquidity mining program, where each protocol on the Kava chain receives incentives in proportion to the amount of TVL on the chain. Current reward distribution is 1M Kava/month. The reward distribution amount will also increase as the ecosystem grows, based on governance vote. Rewards are distributed monthly, usually by the second half of the following month. Because of this important deployment, the team is allocating at least $3M over the next 3 years to these Uniswap pools, from the Kava Rise incentive program. We expect the real allocation to be much higher over the year, depending on how much market share Uniswap attracts. As an example, DefiLlama currently reports Uniswap v3 to have $66.94M TVL on Optimism. If Uniswap had the same amount of TVL on Kava, we can do the math: ($66.94M/$305.39M - total Kava TVL) =21.91% of total TVL on Kava Uniswap would essentially be getting 21.91% of monthly rewards for that month, which is 1M Kava *21.91% = 219,100 Kava that month. These rewards are paid out every single month, and the Kava Rise program is planned to run for several years. A weighted average of TVL reported by DefiLlama is used for calculation of rewards. There are no lock ups for the rewards. Rewards will be administered by the Kava Labs team. License Exemption We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Kava Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Kava provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Kava by Kava Labs]through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script 21\u201d albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team. Timeline After passing the initial Snapshot Check to deploy to Kava EVM, we are looking forward to an on-chain vote, and granted that is passed, we will then have a snapshot vote to determine and finalize what bridging solution we will be using. Then we will be ready to deploy Uniswap v3 onto the Kava EVM network. ",

Because the bridge assessment committee is still unclear, and not voted in yet, I believe we should use precedent for this specific snapshot check and on chain vote. This means voting on everything as a whole. However, whenever the bridge committee is set up, we can halt the proposal wherever it is in its lifecycle and have them review it. If the committee decides Axelar is inadequate, then we will propose another bridge and redo or restart the process. Timeline wise, we will look to move this vote to a snapshot check about 2 weeks from the timing of this post. Assuming the bridging committee is not set up by then, we will proceed with everything all together in the vote. After the snapshot vote, if the committee gets set up in the meanwhile, we will pause the on chain vote for them to review Axelar and make changes if need be. Assuming they approve the bridge then, we will move forward with the on chain vote. If the bridging committee is voted down, or is not set up by time of an on chain vote, we look to move forward with the normal on chain vote as precedent. In short, I believe we should treat this as past deploy onto x chain proposals, until the committee actually gets voted in and set up. Then, happy to pause whenever we are in the timeline for adequate review. ",

                    "content": "We Blockchain at Michigan are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has stated the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s\u2013and not just on Ethereum L2s\u2013is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche\u2019s growing ecosystem.  Proposal Motivation The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did $92.45M of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)\u2013indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market. We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment, we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a multi-bridge system, it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future\u2013but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.  Current State of Avalanche Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche\u2019s security.  Screen Shot 2023-02-25 at 1.03.44 AM1920\u00d7963 68.6 KB  Source: Avalanche Docs Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators\u2019 transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-Chain. In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform\u2019s Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32\u2013surpassing most other L1s\u2013and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are 1,228 validators and over 233M AVAX tokens staked. The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1. The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum\u2019s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. As demand increases for the C-Chain, many projects will opt out of the Primary Network by creating their own subnet. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet\u2019s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network by staking 2,000 AVAX tokens. Avalanche Foundation is prompting the creation of a robust subnet ecosystem through its $290M incentive program. On December 23, 2022, interoperability between subnets was enhanced via Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM), allowing for cross-subnet data and asset transfer.

At the time of writing, according to DeFi Llama, Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.  Screen Shot 2023-02-25 at 1.09.05 AM1692\u00d7768 127 KB  Source: DeFi Llama Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche\u2019s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly 700M. Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced YoY txn growth of 1,507%. Although daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022, average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.

Screen Shot 2023-02-25 at 1.10.54 AM1690\u00d7326 121 KB  Source: DeFi Llama Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, capital efficient AMM, Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche\u2019s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap\u2019s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible. Due to Uniswap\u2019s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche\u2013although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously.  Screen Shot 2023-02-25 at 1.12.18 AM1132\u00d7676 144 KB  Source: Dune Analytics @wanxin Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. NFT Progression:  OpenSea launched natively on Avalanche in October 2022. The NFT Minter application (run on Avalanche) became integrated with Shopify, allowing merchants to create, sell, and mint NFTs.  JoePegs, an NFT marketplace built by Trader Joe, launched in Q2 2022. It has become the most active NFT marketplace on Avalanche and is responsible for onboarding over 50 NFT projects.  Gaming Progression:  Numerous subnets dedicated exclusively to gaming are receiving increasing reception. The DFK subnet generated 1-2 million txns per day in Q4 and increased unique active wallets from 1k to 5k. Swimmer also integrated Snake City and Crabada into its gaming subnet. Crypto Royale migrated from Harmony, and Monsterra launched from BNB Chain to the C-Chain. Japanese media company GREE partnered with Avalanche in October 2022 to build games on its subnets and aid in validating the Primary Network. They have already launched 12+ validators.  User Adoption:  Ava Labs enacted a handful of developments for Avalanche\u2019s multichain wallet, Core. Fiat onramps have been added to Core using Coinbase Pay. Core Web allows for a seamless wallet browser extension for navigating the Avalanche ecosystem\u2013and Core Mobile serves an identical purpose but on Android mobile devices, with iOS coming soon.  Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers\u2013and maybe token holders\u2013will attain economic value from the protocol\u2019s increased usage.  Safety and Cross-Chain Governance  LayerZero Overview We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum. The first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains (including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, Moonbeam), creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing\u2013which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche. LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others\u2013it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion; however, this would require the DAO to operate infrastructure. Ideally, Uniswap governance does not venture into infrastructure maintenance. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol\u2019s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN). Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink\u2013since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity. LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZero\u2019s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren\u2019t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole\u2019s $300M and Nomad\u2019s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs\u2019 future involvements, the protocol has been audited 35+ times and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team. LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M.  Future Bridge Alterations Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup\u2013but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration.  License Exemption We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script\u201d. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.  Timeline Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete. ",

I will say from my perspective, the beauty of concentrated liquidity DEXs, especially those such as Uniswap that have a reputation and more battle tested code is that incentives are not typically required. For example, Trader Joe\u2019s liquidity book on Avalanche has amassed $30m in TVL in a few months  for a brand new concentrated liquidity DEX protocol with no incentives by them or Avalanche. By simply looking at the yields on Liquidity Book pools, it is clear there is demand for similar products on this network. To provide additional comfort, Ava Labs has been and is in touch with liquidity providers who will seed pools on a deployment. ",

To be sure, it is very well possible that liquidity will be raised (as in your example of Trader Joe), but I am not convinced that those initial LPs will be profitable on a risk-adjusted basis. Given that those initial LPs will likely be excited Uniswap community members, I still urge the DAO to negotiate for incentives to bootstrap the network. It certainly does help that Ava Labs is working with LPs to seed the pools, but given that this is a trustless environment, it\u2019s hard to take comfort without more explicit guarantees from Ava Labs.

Yes, the possibility of implementing a multi-bridge system is ever growing; however, nothing in that vein has fully materialized. That structure is currently being reviewed, debated, and tested. No previous deployment has implemented such a standard. Due to the novel nature of a multi-bridge architecture, this proposal prompts Uni delegates and tokenholders to choose LayerZero as the messaging system because it\u2019s simply the path of least resistance\u2013not to mention LZ has worked actively with Avalanche in the past. The relationship is there. And LZ has a proven history of reliability due to active interrogations with a multitude of applications. If in the future the DAO selects to opt into a multi-bridge system, that\u2019s its prerogative. But for now, LZ is the most seamless means forward.

To comment on the landscape where this vote falls - we understand that this proposal comes on the back of a contentious vote for BNB along with the ongoing work to do a full evaluation of bridge providers. However, given the pending BSL expiry and recently having been voted in to service the BNB deployment, we believe that Wormhole is a strong contender as the most pragmatic choice until consensus is reached by the community. Given that the BNB deployment is live and should be added to the UI within a week, we feel confident in Wormhole\u2019s ability to deliver for the Uniswap and Avalanche communities.

I am on the record explaining Avantgarde\u2019s vote in the Binance proposal. In that case, we believed that the benefits of getting an official deployment on that chain before the BSL expired outweighed the risks presented by doing so with a bridge that hadn\u2019t been formally evaluated. Having to make that evaluation at all was a wake up call that the DAO\u2019s process for assessing bridges in cross-chain deployments was broken. In the aftermath of that vote, and the furious politicking that went on behind closed doors, the UF has tasked the newly-formed Bridge Assessment Committee with creating a framework for the community to make better-informed decisions on these issues going forward. In the context of this proposal, and the Kava proposal, and the multitude of \u201cDeploy on X Chain\u201d proposals that are sure to pop up in the forum between now and April 1, we do not believe the \u201cdeploy before the bsl expires and worry about the bridge provider later\u201d tradeoff still holds. While we still don\u2019t believe there is a material risk to the protocol of deploying with Layer Zero, it will increase the burden of the inevitable clean up that we need to do when it comes time to unify the DAOs approach to cross chain messaging. And in the case of every chain/bridge combo we vote on between now and April 1, that technical debt is incurred without a corresponding upside - the BSL will expire before these deployments are pushed to production on the front end. (Having integrated with v3 so that Enzyme users can provide liquidity from their vaults, I am not convinced that there would be  any meaningful contract-level liquidity provision from the drop. I would be happy to be proven wrong on that\u2026 but there\u2019s been zero volume on Binance and the contracts were deployed three weeks ago). Said more plainly - we do want to deploy to Avalanche (and to Kava, and probably to many other chains), but we believe that the costs (technical debt) outweigh the benefits (having an official deployment sometime soonish after the BSL expires). Additionally, voting yes to this proposal incentivizes other chains and bridge providers to make additional deployment proposals which will increase our technical debt which will make cleanup harder which will\u2026 you get the picture. We would be supportive of granting Ava Labs an Additional Use Grant with no bridge specified and then running a Snapshot vote post-Bridge Assessment Committee to approve a bridge provider. Also, as a side note, I just noticed that this proposal is to grant Layer Zero an additional use grant which, though the wording in the proposal is specific to avalanche, seems potentially problematic (not being a lawyer I\u2019d appreciate if someone else who is or has legal counsel on hand to weigh in on that).

Our primary reasoning coincides with the support from the Ava Labs team to proceed with a deployment due to time considerations with the BSL expiring. We fully support the bridge committee process, and we look forward to seeing their output, but we feel conducting the deployment with L0 and re-evaluating the bridge later based on a multi-bridge proposal, or the committee\u2019s final analysis, is an equally viable option with a low degree of risk.
