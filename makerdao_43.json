                    "content": " MIP39c2-SP21: Adding MakerLabs Core Unit  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 21 Author(s): @colrad, @urbanisierung, Tim Schuppener (@ultraschuppi) Contributors: - Tags: core-unit, cu-skunk-001, mandate Status: Rejected Date Applied: 2021-07-19 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Sentence Summary MIP39c2-SP21 adds MakerLabs Core Unit for building and validating MVPs.  Specification  Motivation Good, new products usually emerge from high-risk endeavours. In the world of traditional software engineering, building a Minimum Viable Product either validates or invalidates your product idea. However, real validation is gained from the market when the MVP is released to the public. Real validation is not the promise to use the product but only the product usage itself. While the current setup of the Maker DAO allows for incremental and low-risk improvement of the existing product, the current framework is not set up for pursuing revolutionary product ideas. Therefore we propose a new MakerLabs Core Unit that implements new product ideas spanning across the full stack of decentralized technologies. Having full technological responsibility inside a single Core Unit would give MakerLabs the autonomy to move fast and ultimately test and validate new ideas early.  Responsibilities The MakerLabs Core Unit Team responsibilities essentially revolve around the rapid implementation of new product ideas grounded in solid full-stack engineering practices, including iterative product improvements to find Product Market Fit.   Picking up a new product idea and a fast implementation of an MVP. A wide collection of diverse ideas already exists that can advance the Maker Ecosystem at different levels. The selection for the implementation of the next product lies with the Core Unit in discussion with the Maker Community.  Make the product available and ensure easy entry. Implementing the MVP is only the first step. A product can only be used if it is accessible to a broad user base. This applies to both technical prerequisites and user experience. Technical barriers for users have to be low, and the product needs to be designed for usage without reading long documentation.  Validation and quick iterations based on user feedback and metrics. The most important tool to validate a product is measuring and processing feedback. This involves the use of various channels of direct and indirect user interaction to obtain all the necessary information. The result of validation is binary: Product Market Fit achieved or not.   Team The MakerLabs Core Unit will have a flat management structure led by the facilitator who answers to the community of MKR holders. This Core Unit is being proposed as a single team. Our team has already bootstrapped a couple of products and teams and brought them to market. After solving all the hard problems, we moved over to the next mission. This experience and familiarity with Maker will allow us to be effective from Day 1, with little lead time, no need to recruit heavily and bring an established working process.  Core Unit ID SKUNK-001  Core Unit Name MakerLabs  Core Unit Mandate  Product Implementation Quickly develop new product ideas into usable MVPs.  Products are focused on increasing the Maker Ecosystems value and usability to end users. The scope of the products would be strictly separated from the Maker Protocol. We want to build products upon the Maker Ecosystem, not modify or change but instead leverage what other Core Units e.g. Protocol Engineering or Oracles are building.   Deployment MVPs end up being deployed to test and production environments. Move fast and break things is usually not something you would want to hear in the Maker Ecosystem. We will apply it on test environments but will switch to risk-capped innovation measures on production environments:  Risk to MKR value will be limited to whatever MKR holders find appropriate Risk borne by early adopters will be limited to whatever MKR holders find appropriate   Full Stack Engineering MakerLabs Core Unit will build all aspects of a product.  Smart Contracts User Frontends Metrics   Validation  User Feedback Measure, measure, measure Quick, small iterations to improve the product based on new insights If a product idea is successfully validated, MakerLabs Core Unit will propose plans for the next steps  The first product we\u2019d like to tackle is eurDai. From deploying the eurDai Contracts, to building a eurDai wallet to metrics measuring its success or failure. ",

                    "content": "Hi @Planet_X Thank you for your great questions! Even though I\u2019m not as well versed with the Maker Community as @ultraschuppi, I hope I can clarify some of them.     Planet_X:  I have some questions, forgive me if some of them are not so smart:  When you say Minimum Viable Product (MVP) do you mean testnet viable, or mainnet viable?    If your friend says \u201cIt\u2019s a great product!\u201d, then that is certainly nice to hear but no real validation. We think validation can only be proven when people commit to the product. Be it money, by paying for it. Or be it time, by using it. Therefore we have to deploy the MVP to the mainnet. We believe validation can never happen on testnet.     Planet_X:   Is this a sort of a \u201cSpace-x method\u201d? Crash and burn is certain, but you iterate really fast towards something that works?    I like this \u201cSpace-X\u201d analogy but I think there is a major difference. Early Space-X and similar projects like ITER and Manhattan would have failed because the goal is technically not feasible or too expensive. Software engineering has the great advantage that it\u2019s pretty cheap. The greatest challenge in new software projects is to make something people want, or more precisely make something people want to pay for. So a crash and burn for MakerLabs is not spending 12m on an exploding rocket. But in the end having a rocket that nobody wants to use. Therefore we want to build rockets very fast/cheap and measure if people actually want to use the rocket. If we can prove that people are actually paying for rockets, other teams can step in and build even greater and more efficient rockets.     Planet_X:   If you add a frontend to a MVP (as you plan), are you not quite close to the real thing?    I tend to disagree. Let\u2019s look at something like Facebook. One could argue that the original thefacebook, marketed to College Students was a MVP. But the Facebook we have today is completely different to thefacebook of 2003. The differentiation between MVP and the real thing is even more important for the financial products we are building.  Auditing and hardening the Smart Contract would slow us down. We want all our MVPs to be risk-capped. Supporting the Product for millions of users would drain our small team of all resource Marketing the Product is not something that lies within our expertise Exploiting a market opportunity, going down the rabbit hole of optimization, would lead us away from what we do best. Building and validating unproven Products.  Transforming a MVP to the real thing, is usually an endeavour bigger than building the MVP. This would include all the auditing/hardening work, removing the risk-caps, building an infrastructure for support and monitoring \u2026 and adding new features. Maybe even transforming the Product to adjust it to changing customers needs.     Planet_X:   When you complete the MVP, who will take over and do the rest? Why not do the rest of the job while you are on it? What is lacking here - will or patience?    There are typically 2 types of strategies: exploration and exploitation. We as a team draw the most satisfaction from exploration, this is something we excel at. Other people and teams on the other hand are great at exploiting existing market opportunities. There are a lot of exciting product ideas in the maker community that sound worth pursuing. We want to validate them and then come back to the community with either \u201cGreat Idea and it found adoption\u201d or \u201cGreat Idea but nobody is really using it\u201d In both cases the community can then decide on how to move forward. Even in the case of a successfully validated Product, the community could decide not to move forward (because it does not match the vision of Maker \u2026) Or the community could decide to grant a Budget for exploiting the opportunity more deeply. In the case of an unsuccessful validation the community could propose adjustments for revalidation or decide to drop it for good. We see MakerLabs as a tool for the Maker Community to explore and validate Product Ideas. As any tool we serve one specific purpose. Like a skrewdriver we excel at driving screws but we are less efficient at driving nails.     Planet_X:  and now for the interface questions:  Which groups are you going to interface with? I guess PE will be involved at some point or not?    We will interact with all interfaces that are necessary to implement the MVP. This also means that we have no limitations in the technology stack and may also implement smart contracts (for example). However, in order to move forward as autonomously as possible, we would like to act independent of other Core Units and request as little support as possible from other Core Units. We picked eurDai as the first product because:   We think we can implement it without changes to PEs domain   We probably don\u2019t need to make profound adjustments to the smart contracts   We like the product idea and think it is worth pushing forward.   Some people in the Maker Community want eurDai but nobody has proven that it will be used       Planet_X:   Will SKUNK be a good match with GROW? You could do proof of concept work? That is MVP anyway? Again - take some of the workload off PE?    The inherent difference between PoC and MVP is that PoC usually proves the technical feasibility. MVP proves the market feasibility. If there are topics that call for a MVP (user/market validation) and contain changes to the existing Maker Smart Contract then MakerLabs would be glad to create Pull Requests to the PE repository. But I think before this can happen, MakerLabs has to prove itself to PE and the Maker Community, that we can write sound and safe Smart Contracts and that we would not be a burden to PE.     Planet_X:   How about RWA? There are now 4 or 5 possible methods for getting into US Treasuries - is this something SKUNK could support?    We haven\u2019t thought so much about RWA topics so far (and eurDai will probably suck some time anyway) - I wouldn\u2019t reject any topic without digging into it.     Planet_X:   Is SKUNK willing to do collateral applications? Like the less painful ones to start?    I don\u2019t think we would add great value to collateral applications. At least for me, adding new collateral types seems like a proven process done by the Risk Team, Oracles and PE. It\u2019s like adding a new Feature to an already great Product. From my point of view this falls in the exploitation category and therefore would be outside of MakerLabs domain. ",

Speaking from experience in the PE team, I have seen that engaging newer members into the collateral onboarding process has been one of the quickest ways to get them up to speed on system interactions, tests, and to build an awareness of various protocol dependencies - it\u2019s not so much that they add value to the process - in cases it slows down the process, which is fine because the longer term value outweighs the short term. In saying this, I\u2019m not suggesting that you become a collateral onboarding team, but just thought I\u2019d share the value we have had in integrating people into this weekly (now fortnightly) ritual as a safe proving ground.

Seriously?  We ask for other CU input on a number of topics - why not ask a CU whose work will be impacted by another whether she would rather have another CU or just a budget to hire for the specific task of \u2018long term growth\u2019. My point here is Growth may already have some long term plans.  Now they may not be setup to do the eurDAI - that is fine.   If this was the only thing this CU was tasked with I would be asking why do we need a CU for it, rather than just some bounties being put up for design, implementation and let biz sell it.    Instead this CU having that as its first task also wants longer term funding for doing longer term growth stuff.    Personally if I was the CU of growth I\u2019d feel a bit slighted this group didn\u2019t approach me first for a grant and/or discuss whether it makes sense to have a different CU since these two units are likely going to have overlap.  I have no clue of what internal discussions go on\u2026 I have said before I think multiple CUs for redundancy and quality assurance is a good thing.  But given there is no model for how to shop tasks between such units or who manages authorities with the responsibilities I don\u2019t see how this doesn\u2019t turn into a bit of a management mess. Sure we can let more CUs fly but frankly when a new CU is being proposed that has significant overlap with another I consider it courtesy to at least have people who will be affected weigh in one way or another.  I consider communication \u2018healthy\u2019, decentralization actually means higher levels of communication not less. ",

This is why our focus by now is on:  creating alliances with new players in the PSM (Paxos\u2019s PSM has generated almost 500m DAI, and they are working on the integration of DAI in their APIs that will open new rails for DAI) The institutional vault product (which will help Maker to increase the TVL of ETH and wBTC, increasing DAI in the market) And the integration with companies from all over the world helping us to increase DAI awareness and creating channels for people to access DAI.  We are constantly thinking about what other initiatives we can do. Crypto is a continuously changing environment, and to be successful with our mandate, we have to understand what\u2019s happening around us and create a Maker flavor for that (DAI+Gamers, DAI+NFTs, DAI+Institutions\u2026). Some time ago, @MarianoDP posted an open question to the community about products that could help us create a Maker Nation. It is out of our mandate to have a dev team that could work on that, but we can bring the ideas to the Maker community and try to find out there, teams doing something similar and convince them to integrate the Maker vision by creating a partnership with them. I think we (Growth team and the community in general) have a lot of ideas of what products we want to see as part of that Maker Nation. Besides what Mariano posted, these are other things we asked for in the last ETHOnline hackathon:  An auction keeper implementation to further decentralize and democratize auction participation. A GUI for PSM on IPFS and/or PSM bridge: So we could link our PSM\u2019s and do any type of swap we are capable of doing. A user that has Pax, for example, could swap to USDC or vice versa by just paying the tin to get Dai, and then in the same transaction, it would put Dai into the other PSM and getting the token. The tout is zero going out anyways. A furocombo-like web for arbitrage with PSM and Flash Mint. An optimistic roll up test environment to facilitate the testing of L2 code. Extra points for leveraging Dapptools.  Because of the complexity of Maker and as we haven\u2019t been actively participating in hackathons, none of the teams worked on that. So, my thoughts about the Maker Nation products:  I love the idea I think having more products around Maker will help us to grow It would be great to create more documentation and resources (like a wishlist of products) to have more people building around Maker The scope of these products has to be very well defined and let the community decide if we want a product that takes one month or six months to be built. euroDAI is an excellent solution, still, there are other ideas around, ones more simple than euroDAI, of course with less impact, but I think that\u2019s up to the community to decide. If that\u2019s the product we decide to build, I don\u2019t know how an MVP will work, and I don\u2019t know if we as Growth can go outside and talk with partners about a euroDAI that hasn\u2019t been audited. I trust in @ultraschuppi  skills for this. I have seen how he\u2019s always thinking about how to bring new things to Maker  ",

PaperImperium Delegate Platform   No on Maker Labs Core Unit . This application seemed a bit rushed, and I encourage the applicants to reapply after some more time to build a road map or even consider an incubation with SES. EuroDAI would be very valuable, but it would be such a critical product that it probably needs active assistance from veteran PE members, and a plan for the maintenance of that new product \u2013 it has the potential to be so valuable that we really need to get execution correct the first time. But this needs an articulated way to hand off new products without abandonment or adding them to the PE Core Unit\u2019s duties.   First on a \u201cbit rushed\u201d part, the discussion started in February (Declaration of Intent and the eurDAI thread). The Declaration of Intent was voted in April (a case where bureaucracy killed momentum). You might have missed that as it was happening before you joined. Moreover, @ultraschuppi is a consistent contributor and everyone can get an opinion on the value he created for the protocol (Autonomous MakerDAO member, MOMC member, signal request master, \u2026). Secondly, the whole idea of gating the CU to PE, Growth, and/or SES is centralization. PE doesn\u2019t see eurDAI as a priority (which makes 100% sense, which is why eurDAI is awesome to get a new CU started). Are we saying that eurDAI (something community approved) will never see the light even when sounds people are ready to work on it? Finally, there is a belief that this CU will launch the project and move on no matter what and it will be PE role to clean the mess. This is short-sighted. @ultraschuppi showed to be responsible. We need entrepreneurs like him. I think the proposal is here, take it or leave it. I encourage people to voice their opinion on the poll. Currently, it\u2019s not passing because it seemed a bit rushed. Scientific governance in action  . ",

My only issue here was to have some perspective from Growth on adding the MakerLabs because of how closely your functions overlap unit and it sounds like you like the idea.   I really want to thank you for taking the time on the additional \u2018color\u2019 in this reply. I agree @ultraschuppi and team is a great choice to head this and based on the discussion I will formally change my vote to yes to support this initiative. I really want to express a concern with all these CU applications that if/when Maker revenues drop Maker is going to be caught between a rock and a hard place on funding which may likely mean selling MKR from reserves.    Lets hope it doesn\u2019t come to this, but given the growth in expenses here (all CUs are asking for more heads, and funding to go with this, and on top of this we are adding more CUs).   I don\u2019t have formal numbers here but I have a real concern that expenditure growth is going to grow too much. I want to echo @PaperImperium discussion point with respect to other CU request funding growth for these CUs for them to give a report back about whether they are actually banking any of this funding that is unspent or the more likely scenario they are coming up short and using forward funding to cover back dated salaries/expenses.  It was my hope that these CUs with extra funding wouldn\u2019t just spend it but actually work to save some and I would like on top of actual expense metrics to track unused funding so the DAO can get a real handle on what is going on with expenses overall.    The real problem here is lack of incentives not to spend and to ask for constantly increasing budgets and head counts. ",

Through implementation and measuring of smallest possible prototypes for new ideas, any organisation must ensure they have a pipeline of new proven solutions to provide the basis for growth in future years. Basically keep agile, nimble and ready for change through experimentation, especially in this crazy space we are in where things change from month to month. A few people brought up a concern of who to hand over the prototype project after its completion by MakerLabs. In my opinion this is a non-issue, as @colrad has covered in the call as well - if its valuable to the users and Maker\u2019s growth, it\u2019ll be in the community\u2019s interest to find a way to continue running with the project. If it\u2019s not valuable the project gets dropped, simple. To determine this, MakerLabs needs to be able to demonstrate that the prototype (eurDai in this case) provides value to the audience it was designed for. And this hasn\u2019t really been covered - how this will be accomplished and what metrics exactly will be used? However the application seems a little two-faced - \u201cWe\u2019re not eurDai CU but we\u2019re gonna work on that, if that doesn\u2019t work we\u2019ll ask community for ideas\u201d. So another question is - will this CU be prepared to go ahead with some other project, not eurDai - potentially voted by the community, from the start? ",

                    "content": " MIP40c3-SP32: Adding MakerLabs Core Unit Budget MIP40c3-SP#: 32 Author(s): @colrad, @urbanisierung, Tim Schuppener (@ultraschuppi) Contributors: Tags: core-unit, cu-skunk-001, budget, dai-budget, mkr-budget Status: Rejected Date Applied: 2021-09-01 Date Ratified:   Sentence Summary MIP40c3-SP32 adds the budget for the MakerLabs Core Unit, SKUNK-001.  Specification  Motivation We estimate this budget for the MakerLabs Core Unit to successfully implement and validate MVPs for the Maker ecosystem. More details about the scope and content of the Core Unit can be found here. We\u2019re proposing the following budget to deliver on our mandate. This includes, but is not limited to  Implement, Deploy, and Validate  MVPs in the Maker ecosystem.  Budget Considerations MakerLabs does not have a specific product as its mission. It is rather about implementing and validating different ideas that can help the Maker ecosystem. For this reason, this budget proposal is not for a specific product but instead for setting up a team that is capable of implementing MVPs. If costs for a specific product arise during implementation or at the time of deployment, this additional budget will be requested. The following considerations have been taken into account when building the proposed budget:  A competitive salary in-line with industry standards A competitive benefits package in-line with industry standards A high travel budget, in order to fund attending crypto conferences and team offsites which are critical for remote teams to build interpersonal relationships; vital for collaboration and retention. A healthy contingency in case budget estimates are significantly off   Budget The budget for the MakerLab Core Unit consists of three elements:  a monthly budget covering the expenses - 82.6k DAI an initial setup budget for setting up the core unit - 54.8k DAI an upfront lump-sum to guarantee continuous operations - 247.8k DAI  This budget secures a team of 3 full-time employees as well as covers all operational costs listed below. This budget will continue on a rolling basis until modified or cancelled by Maker Governance. At the end of the calendar year, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker Protocol. Should the MakerLabs Unit shutdown, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately.     Component Setup Monthly Budget     Employee Salaries  EUR 37,500 \u2192 DAI 44,250   Employment Taxes, Insurances  EUR 9375 \u2192 DAI 11063   Travel  EUR 3000 \u2192 DAI 3,540   Legal and Operating expenses EUR 30000 \u2192 DAI 35,400 EUR 2000 \u2192 DAI 2,360   Tools/Services/Devices EUR 9000 \u2192 DAI 10,620 EUR 600 \u2192 DAI 708   IT Services  EUR 1000 \u2192 DAI 1,180   Contingency  EUR 5,347 \u2192 DAI 6,310   Corporate Income Tax EUR 7410 \u2192 DAI 8,744 EUR 11,176 \u2192 DAI 13,188   One time setup EUR 46410 \u2192 DAI 54,764    Total Monthly Budget  EUR 69,998 \u2192 DAI 82,599     Budget Details  Total Employee Costs The team has 3 full-time developers, one of them also doing the Facilitator role. The total cost of an employee includes salary, all benefits (including healthcare), and taxes. This has been calculated by scaling salaries by 25%. This premium is likely an overestimation, and the realized cost is expected to be lower.  Travel (stolen from MIP40c3-SP15) Conferences and team offsites have been critical in the Maker Foundation\u2019s history of fostering interpersonal relationships and generating trust. These are vital qualities in a company\u2019s culture that improve collaboration, productivity, and retention. Conferences in particular also serve a multitude of purposes. Employees are educated about the bleeding-edge technologies in the industry, and can apply that knowledge within the MakerLabs Core Unit. This budget would cover flights, lodging, nourishment, team-activities, and conference passes.  Legal Coverage for legal costs including entity creation, legal officer/company insurance, as well as monthly and annual financial reporting.  Tools/Services/Devices New team members will need to be provided with laptops for the duration of their employment and licenses for essential productivity tools.  IT Services Any services, such as infrastructure providers (hosting providers, IPFS nodes, \u2026) or third-party services, such as services for tracking and evaluating user interactions are essential for the implementation of software products.  Contingency As with any new endeavor, especially in an industry innovating as quickly as ours, there are many unknowns when it comes to estimating budget requirements, as well as unexpected costs that arise from time-to-time. The contingency represents 10% of the total budget and is there to act as a safety buffer.  Corporate Income Tax From our current understanding about taxation of income from a DAO the legal entity will be subject to pay income tax on all DAI distributions we convert to FIAT. We still hope there is another way of dealing with that, in this case this position will become different.  Budget Distribution The budget is to be distributed on a monthly basis to the MakerLabs Core Unit Multisig, which is an instance of a Gnosis Safe multisig. Note that the Maker Protocol retains full administrative control of the funds in the MakerLabs Core Unit Multisig. To start, the multisig has 3 signers (see below) with a quorum of 2. This ensures that no rogue member is able to control the funds.  Budget Implementation Distribution will be manual until a best-practice distribution method has been adopted by a majority of core units.  Initial Setup   54,800 DAI will be transferred to 0x89C5d54C979f682F40b73a9FC39F338C88B434c6 (teamwallet.makerlabs.eth) on 2021-11-10   Lump Sum   247,800 DAI will be transferred to 0x89C5d54C979f682F40b73a9FC39F338C88B434c6 (continuity.makerlabs.eth) on 2021-11-10   Monthly Payments   991,200 DAI will be streamed to 0xb179F0760B1f1D71A447B8c37BBF5ef99E4dF6c9 (teamwallet.makerlabs.eth) starting 2022-01-01 and ending 2022-12-31 at a rate of $82600 DAI per month.   MakerLabs Core Unit Multisig Ownership: This multisig (teamwallet.makerlabs.eth \u2192 0xb179F0760B1f1D71A447B8c37BBF5ef99E4dF6c9) will consist of the three members of the MakerLabs Team:   @urbanisierung \u2192 urbanisierung.makerlabs.eth \u2192 0x02012c3943ee2DEe32FAA35105F4E6bd2bCE6978   @colrad  \u2192 colrad.makerlabs.eth \u2192 0x02012c3943ee2DEe32FAA35105F4E6bd2bCE6978   @ultraschuppi \u2192 schuppi.makerlabs.eth \u2192 0x2eC2331809F63B64ea1F4f34b51D992fc0D3E683   This multisig conforms to the requirement ratified by Maker Governance in MIP47.  Conditions - Continuous Operation To ensure 3 months of continuous operation in the event of emergency shutdown or protocol issues or to defund/undeploy the Core unit, the MakerLab Unit is requesting an upfront lump-sum of $247.8k to sit in a multisig controlled by a set of 5 Core Unit Facilitators.  Calculation: The lump sum is the equivalent of 3 months of expenses.  Rationale: If normal protocol operation is not possible due to emergency shutdown or other protocol failure, these funds will be used to ensure employment resources get the system back up and functional. This will also be used in case the DAO wants to tear down the Core Unit to allow the corresponding legal entity to properly lay off the employees according to local law. At the conclusion of the year, the lump sum will remain in the multisig for the following year and may be increased at that point in time due to team growth or the need for an increased runway. Note that this multisig is NOT controlled by Maker Governance but rather exclusively by a set of Core Unit Facilitators. This is intentional to protect the funds in the event of a governance attack. Governance can indirectly transfer these funds back through a consensus of Core Unit Facilitators.

We want to apply one modification, removing Repricing and Renewal. We propose this modification to remove uncertainty for MKR Holders and suppress MKR Price speculation in the Team.     Property Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6 month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $ 3072 (26.02.2021 - 26.08.2021)   Biannual MKR Amount Initial Annual Incentive Value (USD) / MKR/USD lock-in Price   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, the Biannual MKR amount vests every 6 months and is distributed on Jan/Jul 1st (assuming the Core Unit starts working in January 2022).

If the protocol can\u2019t pay out for 3 months, I\u2019m not sure we will need anyone\u2019s services at all.   The fund serves two purposes:  in case of emergency shutdown or other protocol issues the fund is going to be used to ensure continuous operations of the CU (similar to the budget proposal of Protocol Engineering) if there is a CU shutdown/defunding happening with less than 3 month notice, the funds are being used to pay the expenses of the CU for another 3 months.  Please bear in mind that in both cases the fund acts as a last-resort-budget, so it is quite likely it is never used or just partially used. ",

There is no such thing as unsmart questions about German tax law. I have to admit all the talks I had in the last weeks about this domain are the most pressing point on why I would refrain from this CU proposal in the first place  Edit: noteworthy not the session I had with @layerzero today! So yes, the seed funding seems to be a chicken-and-egg-problem. Most probably we will need to have the funding before the GmbH starts to exist. In this case, we will just go with our personal FIAT to do that. Then it is likely no corporate tax will apply (but maybe something different - most probably personal income tax, which is even higher!). It is hard to find somebody who likes to give legal advice without getting an upfront bribepayment. In any case - and this will be applied to any item on the budget proposal - if we need less DAI we will not put the money secretly into our own pockets, but instead return. ",
