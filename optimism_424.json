Please familiarize yourself with the Nominations process for RetroPGF round 2.   Overview of Timelines  Project nominations: Jan 17 19:00 GMT - Jan 31 19:00 GMT Final project opt-in deadline: Feb 21 Voting: Mar 7 - Mar 21   image1920\u00d7960 32.1 KB    Scope of this round RetroPGF round 2 is dedicated to projects that support development and usage of the OP Stack. For the category of Infrastructure + Dependencies you may nominate:  Software used to build or deploy the OP Stack; Contributions to protocols or standards upon which the OP Stack runs Experiments that support future development of the core OP Stack protocol  Note: The OP Stack refers to the OSS code powering Optimism. Today, this means the Optimism monorepo and its dependencies. Eligible projects need not be exclusive to the Optimism ecosystem, but there should be a connection. For example,   go-ethereum is an important dependency of the OP Stack, but is not Optimism-specific.  Ethereum L2 explorer pages which give stats on various L2s provide educational impact for the OP Stack, but are not Optimism-specific    How to Nominate a Project Things to consider when nominating a project:  Try to describe as best as you can how this project has delivered impact relating to the scope of this round. Make sure to nominate projects in the relevant category Before nominating a project please see if this project has been nominated already, so we can avoid duplication.  For Projects:  If you are a project looking to participate in this round please have a read of the Project Manual, it has an overview of the process and an FAQ section to answer questions that might come up. For your project to be eligible you will need to opt into the round and complete a project profile in the RetroPGF application manager by Feb 21 - 19:00 GMT. This will include providing more information about your project and verifying your Github or Twitter account. The application manager will be launched by end of Jan, more details to follow on this soon! Any project without a correctly verified GitHub or Twitter account, any project impersonating another team, any project not relating to the scope of the round, or any project without a complete profile may be hidden from the voting round at the Foundation\u2019s discretion. Projects are allowed to nominate themselves. Here the term \u201cproject\u201d can describe work that has been done by both an individual or a group. Collections, a term used to describe projects without a single person or entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter, may only be nominated by the Optimism Foundation.   Please use this template to Nominate a project:   The projects name:  A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack:  A link to the project\u2019s GitHub or Twitter:  (optional) contact info for the project or project lead:  Project Nominations will close by Jan 31 at 19:00 GMT ",

The projects name: Fractal Visions NFT Marketplace   A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: The need for prevailing NFT marketplaces has been an integral part of the Optimism ecosystem and we have worked very hard to establish a high level of social recognition for the OP NFT community with the use of optimistic blockchain scaling technology by constantly expanding our user base & key partners within our own network.     Ecosystem Awareness - The growth we have seen over the most recent Q4 of 2022 has been exceptional with close to 100,000 free NFT claims on layer two via Galxe & Quest3 platforms.   Retropgf.eth donations - Besides the educational based quests we also have 8 different NFT projects that continue to contribute directly to the Retropgf.eth address and we will continue to expand this aspect of our project with educational efforts as we onboard new users.     Current development of an Optimism centric NFT marketplace to house our core native ecosystem NFT collections from Fractal Visions will assist in the initial formation of committee members for our future DAO voting structure related to the NFT market. This will expand into a high level niche category art & music marketplace as we curate the artists who join the layer two ecosystem after our initial launch and begin implementation of off chain voting via snapshot for artist curation with the community after the initial artist line up has been established.   Dedicated tooling for an Optimism NFT Launchpad are also in the plans of development once our secondary marketplace operations have officially opened to the public. Recently the addition of the \u201cAttestation Station\u201d has also become another integration we are going to plan on implementing with our marketplace.   Our goal is to help educate or assist other creators about crucial information and proper guidance when choosing deployment on the Optimism network for NFTs. This begins with basic 101 eduction on safety & security about blockchain technology before bringing them into the ecosystem.

Ecosystem Awareness - The growth we have seen over the most recent Q4 of 2022 has been exceptional with close to 100,000 free NFT claims on layer two via Galxe & Quest3 platforms.   Retropgf.eth donations - Besides the educational based quests we also have 8 different NFT projects that continue to contribute directly to the Retropgf.eth address and we will continue to expand this aspect of our project with educational efforts as we onboard new users.    Current development of an Optimism centric NFT marketplace to house our core native ecosystem NFT collections from Fractal Visions will assist in the initial formation of committee members for our future DAO voting structure related to the NFT market. This will expand into a high level niche category art & music marketplace as we curate the artists who join the layer two ecosystem after our initial launch and begin implementation of off chain voting via snapshot for artist curation with the community after the initial artist line up has been established. Dedicated tooling for an Optimism NFT Launchpad are also in the plans of development once our secondary marketplace operations have officially opened to the public. Recently the addition of the \u201cAttestation Station\u201d has also become another integration we are going to plan on implementing with our marketplace. Our goal is to help educate or assist other creators about crucial information and proper guidance when choosing deployment on the Optimism network for NFTs. This begins with basic 101 eduction on safety & security about blockchain technology before bringing them into the ecosystem.

                    "content": "Project Name Otterscan Description Otterscan is a fast, local, free & open source Ethereum block explorer. Otterscan is designed to run on consumer hardware so that it can be utilized locally. Otterscan therefore reduces the trust assumption that many of us implicitly place on third-party block explorers, a critical point of failure in the current Ethereum ecosystem. Furthermore, existing block explorers understand their dominant position within the space and are able to charge large fees to run hosted explorers for chains. Ethereum wins when good infrastructure is cheap and open source, and Otterscan has embodied this concept for years. Otterscan currently relies on a connection to an Erigon node. With the Bedrock upgrade, Optimism will be one of the only chains other than Ethereum that can support an Erigon node (development on op-erigon is already under way). This means Optimism will be uniquely positioned to benefit from Otterscan\u2019s work in the short term. As a result, supporting Otterscan for its past impact on Ethereum will also directly help create future impact on Optimism. Otterscan\u2019s design philosophy also helps other teams outside of Otterscan to create impact. For example, Otterscan\u2019s UI is cleanly decoupled from its API so that anyone can easily fork Otterscan\u2019s interface and add new features or fix bugs. Otterscan also actively pushes for decentralization by integrating tools like Sourcify, a decentralized alternative to Etherscan contract verification. Otterscan is currently being developed by a single developer, Willian Mitsuda, with a small amount of financial support from the Erigon team. Rewarding Otterscan through RetroPGF would allow the Otterscan team to grow and create even more impact for both Optimism and Ethereum. In my opinion, open source infrastructure like Otterscan is the perfect candidate for RetroPGF. Links  Otterscan on Twitter Otterscan on GitHub Willian Mitsuda on Twitter  Contact  Willian Mitsuda on Twitter  Disclaimers I work for OP Labs. I am making this nomination in my capacity as an individual and not on behalf of OP Labs. I have been in contact with Willian Mitsuda for a few months to talk about potential sources of funding (including RetroPGF) for Otterscan. I had no relationship with Otterscan prior to those discussions other than being a fan of the project from afar. Willian was given the opportunity to review this nomination and provide additional data that would help inform its content, but I retained final say over all content in the post. ",

Here is a description of hop: Hop Exchange Bridge is a protocol that allows users to move digital assets between different blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Optimism, with minimal fees and high security. It enables cross-chain interoperability, enabling assets to be moved across different networks in a decentralized manner. The Hop Exchange Bridge protocol is based on a system of \u201cbridges\u201d that connect different blockchain networks. Each bridge is a smart contract on one blockchain that is connected to a smart contract on another blockchain. When a user wants to move an asset from one blockchain to another, they send the asset to the bridge smart contract on the originating blockchain. The bridge smart contract then locks the asset and sends a message to the bridge smart contract on the destination blockchain, which releases the corresponding asset on the destination blockchain. The protocol uses a mechanism called \u201cproof of custody\u201d to ensure that the assets are securely transferred from one network to another. This mechanism uses a combination of smart contracts and cryptographic techniques to ensure that the assets are transferred in a secure and decentralized manner. The Hop Exchange Bridge enables users to move assets across different blockchain networks with minimal fees and high security, making it a valuable tool for trading, liquidity provision, and cross-chain DeFi. As a result, Hop Exchange is considered a public good for Optimism because it increases the interoperability of layer 2 solutions, enabling them to communicate and exchange assets with each other. This allows more people to use the Ethereum network and enables a wider range of decentralized applications to be built. It also allows for more efficient use of resources, as it allows different layer 2 solutions to specialize in different types of transactions, rather than each one trying to do everything.

A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: Trueblocks and the unchained index, have not yet started working on optimism but I know they have experimented with multi-evm and polygon so optimism is definitely a possible and much needed extension. Trueblocks  answers a simple question. For a given address, give me all possible transactions that \u201ctouch\u201d it. From/to, token transfers, address just randomly appearing somewhere in the input data. All of those will be returned. It achieves that by creating an extra index over either a full or an archive node. This is a major missing piece from all evm chains. This allows you to simply get \u201call your transactions\u201d without relying on 3rd party APIs or having to install and index one subgraph per protocol you used and miss transactions you may have done and forgot. In my honest opinion we need to support their work and expansion to all evm chains so that it becomes easy as pie to use them and finally have a decentralized way of querying for our transactions.

Here is a description of the hops: Hop Exchange Bridge is a protocol that allows users to move digital assets between different blockchain networks like Ethereum and Optimism with minimal fees and high security. Supports cross-chain interoperability, allowing assets to move decentrally between different networks. The Hop Exchange Bridge protocol is based on a system of \u201cbridges\u201d that connect different blockchain networks. Each bridge is a smart contract on one blockchain connected to a smart contract on another blockchain. When a user wants to transfer funds from one blockchain to another, they send funds to a bridging smart contract on the original blockchain. The bridging smart contract then locks the asset and sends a message to the bridging smart contract on the destination blockchain, thereby releasing the corresponding asset on the destination blockchain. The protocol uses a mechanism called \u201cProof of Storage\u201d to ensure the secure transfer of assets from one network to another. The mechanism uses a combination of smart contracts and cryptography to ensure that assets are transferred in a secure and decentralized manner. The Hop Exchange Bridge allows users to move assets between different blockchain networks with minimal fees and high security, making it an invaluable tool for cross-chain trading, liquidity, and DeFi. hop exchange github hop ",

This is why I am going to nominate Odos. Odos is a multichain aggregator, it searches among all the integrated pools and find for you the best path to swap. It supports lots of different platforms and pools, so the options are varied. You can always find reasonable/profitable paths to swap. Until now I probably swapped 300+ times there on Optimism alone and significant number of those swaps ended with positive slippage.

Its members come from 23 teams across the ecosystem:  Client & Infrastructure teams, such as EthereumJS, Erigon, Geth, Hyperledger Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Portal Network, Prysm, Solidity, Teku Research orgs thinking about how to shape the protocol: EF Research, Ipsilon, Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE), Robust Incentives Group (RIG), TXRX Coordination & Support for network upgrades and the teams listed above: EF Security, EF Protocol Support, EF Testing, EF DevOps, Ethereum Cat Herders  See the full list of individuals here. Two notes:  This should not be interpreted as an exhaustive list of all Ethereum contributors. Protocol Guild membership is opt-in and there are eligible core contributors who have decided to not participate for various reasons. Expect the membership to change over time - it\u2019s regularly updated through member curation and adjustments to the eligibility framework. However, even on a longer timeframe, we don\u2019t expect PG\u2019s membership to increase significantly.  The idea for the mechanism originated in 2021. It came about in response to recurring challenges related to the ecosystem being able to holistically fund core Ethereum infrastructure, with a specific consideration towards rebalancing the incentives towards contributing to the Ethereum protocol. To learn more, check out the docs.  Ethereum X Optimism As a rollup, Optimism will leverage Ethereum for settlement & security assurances. Optimism also hopes to make use of new scaling mechanisms like proto-danksharding (EIP-4844). These will reduce rollup user fees, which broadens access to Ethereum\u2019s trust assurances to as many people around the world.  Protocol Guild members are intimately engaged in both the long-term work required to maintain the network, as well as building these newer constructions. Given the mutual relationship between this work and the goals of the Optimism community, it makes sense to directly fund the people doing this infrastructure work. Long-term thinking is baked into Protocol Guild\u2019s architecture. Our members\u2019 protocol contributions range from 9 months to 8 years, with the median having ~3 years. When any funding is received, this value is used as a \u201ctime-weighting\u201d to allocate each members\u2019 share relative to the whole membership. This ensures long-term contributors are properly recognized, and closely aligns with the retroactive aspect of RPGF. We also vest any funding (eg. 1 year in the Pilot, 4 years for future iterations), which will hopefully lead to a more stable set of contributors over time. Learn more about the smart contracts here. We\u2019re excited to be considered for this retroactive round! Your support as a prominent ecosystem participant helps to maintain the Public Good funding norms both communities should aspire to, while also rebalancing the incentives for individuals contributing to foundational infrastructure. Please reply with any questions here or on twitter and we\u2019d be happy to answer them! ",

All Batches are stored in the Ethereum contract CTC(CanonicalTransactionChain). In essence, this CTC constitutes the Optimism blockchain. When the transaction batch has been uploaded to Ethereum (or an individual wallet transmits a transaction directly from the CTC Contract\u2019s enqueue method), the CTC contract will emit a \u201cTransactionEnqueued\u201d Event. The \u201csequencer\u201d service monitors this event to update the L2 transaction state. After the tx\u2019s data has been submitted to Ethereum, the sequencer\u2019s other service \u201cbatch-submitter\u201d will periodically submit these tx\u2019s (block\u2019s because each tx has a block) stateRoot to Ethereum in larger batches to prove a transaction is on-chain. These batches are held in an Ethereum contract known as SCC(State Commitment Chain). The SCC comprises a list of state roots, which correspond to the result of applying each transaction in the CTC to the prior state in an optimistic scenario. After that, Fault proofs can function. Since there is no direct verification of stateRoot\u2019s validity, every stateRoot can be contested via \u201cfault-proof.\u201d If the stateRoot is successfully challenged, it is removed from the StateCommitmentChain and replaced with a different proposed stateRoot. A successful challenge does not roll back Optimism itself, but rather the public stateRoot of the chain. The sequence of transactions and the state of Optimism are unaffected by a challenge that is flawless. How will the OP tokens be distributed?

It is developed by ScopeLift, and it was originally funded by a grant from the Uniswap Grant Program (UGP). The most relevant application for Flexible Voting on Optimism comes in the form of cross chain governance voting. Currently, if a user bridges their Layer 1 Governance tokens to Optimism, they\u2019re not longer able to participate in Governance votes. Flexible Voting allows for an elegant, trust minimized solution to this limitation. The bridge contract delegates its votes to a proxy contract, and the proxy contract votes proportionally on behalf of holders of the bridged token. With cross chain communication, holders of a governance token on Optimism could vote on Optimism\u2014paying the cheaper gas prices available there\u2014then be guaranteed this vote will be reflected on L1. A single cross chain transaction can roll up the votes of thousands of holders on Optimism into a single delegated vote on L1. This encourages more activity on L2 by enabling Governance Token holders to bridge their tokens to Optimism without giving up their ability to participate in proposal votes. ScopeLift is currently working to see Flexible Voting adopted as an ecosystem standard. In addition to our work to enable Layer 2 voting we\u2019ve also:  Implemented an integration with Aave, thanks to a grant from Aave Grants DAO Scheduled audit of the Flexible Voting contracts with OpenZeppelin Been enlisted by GitcoinDAO to upgrade their Governor Coordinated with Tally to see Flexible Voting support added to their DAO tooling  A link to the project\u2019s GitHub or Twitter: ScopeLift/flexible-voting Contact info for the project or project lead: Ben DiFrancesco (ben at scopelift dot co) ",

Having full ownership over their smart contracts, we are empowering these creators to truly have full-control over what gets included in their smart contracts and what doesn\u2019t with a wealth of advanced configurations and contract types at their disposal. Our full suite of smart contracts and configurations are all available for free to any creator looking to launch on Optimism.   Development in Progress: Within the Launchifi ecosystem we have a number of features set to roll out in the next few weeks. One of which is a contract manager, which allows users to access and make calls to their newly deployed contracts all from one dashboard. This will be a very similar experience to Remix, only much more user friendly and integrated for all the chains that we support, most importantly Optimism. No more toggling between tabs and windows to write, deploy and manage a smart contract. Our system will enable this development cycle all under one roof 100% code free. Along with our no-code smart contract launchpad, we are currently developing a mint dapp marketplace that will be included for every contract that gets deployed through our platform. Upon deployment of their smart contract, the user simply has to visit the marketplace, edit their collection page (similar to an opensea collection editing), and launch their mint. The user\u2019s smart contract will automatically be linked to their collection page so no extra coding or work will be necessary. With this, we hope to become the easiest and most user friendly way to launch Optimism, and other EVM based, NFT collections bringing even more incredible creators to the space.   Web3 Education: Beyond our platform tools, we are planning to roll out our educational youtube series of videos. To not only supplement the platform for overall ease of use and understanding, but teach our community members about Web3 systems and technology. We hope to educate our community on the benefits and applications of smart contracts, how they work, and what it takes to develop their own and truly master this domain. Other topics we have planned are Web3 safety and security, exploratory applications of smart contracts, and more.

However, I must also clarify I am not very familiar with the project as I have not had much time to use it. With the deadline for RPGF2 being today, I decided to nominate the project for your consideration even if I am not that acquainted with it myself. The project\u2019s name: 1RPC.io ( https://www.1rpc.io/ ) A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack: Even though in theory everyone can interact directly with the OP Ecosystem like every other EVM environment, it\u2019s undeniable that the vast majority of users not only use an RPC solution, but are not even aware of it. For these users, these RPCs serve as an essential middle-man between the user and the environment, and any error on the RPC side can be a significant blocker. One particular example for this we\u2019re all familiar with is the release date of the first OP Airdrop, where despite the actual Optimism network working just fine, the RPC was overloaded blocking access to the ecosystem. This, along with potential privacy concerns from some RPC solutions, means that it\u2019s always healthy for an ecosystem to have a large variety of RPC providers to choose from. As seen in Chainlist.org, currently there are only about half a dozen providers of RPCs, with only two being shown as being privacy-friendly. I am nominating https://www.1rpc.io/ because not only is it one of the two privacy respecting RPCs , but they seem to want to be a pubic good and do not have a monetisation plan. From their page:  Privacy should be protected because it is one of the foundations and basic right for users of the public ledger blockchain ecosystems. We want 1RPC to be freely available and have developed it as a public good, providing users from targeted data collection when interacting with blockchains. We strive to keep it free for general Web3 users. To help us keeping it free, donations from grants and partners are accepted to make 1RPC sustainable.  Hopefully, this grant along with other future grants will encourage the onboarding of more private RPCs into the ecosystem.

The way in which we achieve this is two-fold: First, we use Revest FNFTs (also developed by us) to tokenize locked principal and future yield. Next, we build ERC-4626 adapters (if need be) for existing farms for Resonate to plug into. These 4626 adapters are rigorously tested and subsequently released as public goods. Follow our progress on this initiative by checking out these Medium articles: ERC-4626 Vault Adapters Resonate Vaultening Update 1 Resonate Vaultening Update 2 Users are, then, able to trade their future yield for yield upfront by locking their principal for a term, while the counter-party is able to earn a boosted yield rate by earning the variable yield on the aforementioned locked principal. So far, we\u2019ve found a great deal of success with Velodrome on some of our VELO-USDC pools. For example: Resonate has had over $100k in volume. It offers 4.57% upfront on VELO-USDC for a lock term of 30 days (55.6% annualized). Resonate is able to offer short-term lock-ups and rolling maturities thanks to Revest FNFTs. Furthermore, Resonate offers zero-slippage trades due to our order-book-like system. So how does this appeal to institutions? Well, in industries as volatile as crypto, market-neutral hedge funds have proven to be one of the most secure ways to invest in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). These investment vehicles function by both longing and shorting an asset (market neutrality) and then earn their investors returns by placing the longed asset into a yield-bearing position (\u201cyield farm\u201d), where it accrues interest and grows in value. This growth, however, does not occur at a predictable rate, often deviating heavily within short time-frames. This volatility in yield rates make it very difficult for market-neutral funds to succeed, as fixed-costs to open a position can quickly overshadow these variable returns, leaving the fund net-negative. Resonate is able to the perfect solution here: short-term lock and immediate upfront fixed-rates! As a matter of fact, we\u2019ve already seen success in our pursuit of on-boarding institutions to DeFi.

Before I was recommended Infinity Wallet I was using Metamask, since switching I will never again use another browser extension. The Infinity Wallet guys have made the entire experience of using OP so much smoother and normal.

It provides similar functionality to web3.js + Truffle in that supports the development, testing and deployment of Solidity contracts for the Java and Android platforms. There isn\u2019t an L2 specific version of the library, but it is the library used by anyone wishing to talk to Ethereum networks on the JVM or Android platforms. Of which there is a lot \u2014  it receives over 100k downloads/month and has over 2 million lifetime downloads (this is a conservative estimate). No one pays for Web3j, it\u2019s pure OSS, and has been around since 2016. We have received grants for the library over the years, but as Optimism grows, there are like to be more JVM users, and they will in all likelihood be using Web3j to do this.
