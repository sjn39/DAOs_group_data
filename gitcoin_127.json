There was no clear indication as to why, just no \u201cNew topic\u201d button, so I ended up using the Reply function on an unrelated post. Paradoxically, this is exactly what spammers do - this new post blocking measure has already backfired. It so happens that I also run a Discourse forum of my own, so I knew what I had to do in order to move up one trust level, but most users won\u2019t be able to easily figure that out. Yes, there\u2019s a link to Understanding the Discourse Trust Levels but many users may not click through that. I believe onboarding could be better by:  Spelling out in that first @discobot message what a user needs to do in order to be able to post. Bump the trust level already for GitHub SSO logins. Offer a faster alternative verification mechanism for bumping up the trust level.  ",
