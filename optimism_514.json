Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: every 2 months Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: 1. Launch an MVP + IRL Event in NYC2.

Launch an AR App Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We will become the most sophisticated and curated metaverse platform managed by community. We will create a lot of Public Good, value in form of art, metaverse spaces, toolkits, workshops, tokengated IRL events and physical products. We want to make this platform social and protect user\u2019s trademarks.
