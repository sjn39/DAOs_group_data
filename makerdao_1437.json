                    "content": " MKR Token Decentralization Views Commentary on data as of July 14, 2022 (embedded views will auto refresh with updated data). All views exclude Maker-owned addresses that hold MKR. Addresses known to be owned by a single entity are lumped together. Unless otherwise specified, views only include addresses/entities with at least 1 MKR token. One aspect of decentralization in the DAO is how decentralized the MKR token is, as it represents governance power. For this reason, we put together some metrics to show the community how decentralized the MKR token is and how that has changed over time. We can potentially use these or similar metrics to track MKR token decentralization going forward. Here is a simple view of how many MKR holders there are, by bucketed size of holdings:  . Similarly, here is a view of the total amount of MKR tokens in each of these buckets:  . One measure of decentralization is how many effective voters there can be. For this, we can track the number of MKR holders with at least 1 token, as we assume less than that is not worth the gas to vote. As shown below, this number has decreased since April 2021 but is a longer-term overall uptrend:  . Similarly, it is important to track the voting power of the single largest holder, which seems to be steadily declining:  . It takes more than a single holder to dominate a vote though. In the most active vote in Maker history, the winning side had roughly 20% of available MKR tokens voting on the winning side. Thus, one can reasonably conclude that a coalition that comprises 20% of the vote can dominate any vote. Here is the amount of top wallets/entities it would take to make up 20%, through time:  As you can see above, at the current moment, all it takes is 3 entities to dominate votes. Similarly, here is the amount of top wallets/entities it would take to comprise 50% of available MKR holdings:  Fortunately, this metric has been in an uptrend since December 2020. Ideally, we want to see delegation going up to represent more active governance by the many. Here is the total number of MKR delegated through time, which has been increasing significantly lately:  Here is the same view represented as the percentage of the total available MKR tokens:  . Similarly, the number of delegators has been increasing, a sign of increased decentralization:  . Finally, following is the relative difference between the mean and median through time. This is a proxy measure of the skew of the distribution; a higher relative difference means more right-skew and more inequality.  This has increased over time, suggesting that distribution is increasingly right-skewed over time, with increasing inequality. In other words, MKR has been concentrating more in wallets with greater than the median amount of tokens (in the upper half) than in wallets with less than the median. Another measure of inequality of a distribution, typically used in income distributions, is the Gini Coefficient. Complete inequality is represented as a score of 100, whereas complete equality is represented as a score of 0. The current gini coefficient is 96.74, which represents a high level of inequality.  We will soon have views of the Gini Coefficient through time to see how this is trending. . Conclusion Decentralization is one of the core principles of MakerDAO. One of the most important aspects of decentralization for the DAO to track and understand is how decentralized the MKR token is, as it represents governance power. These metrics aim to assist in this dimension. These metrics can be found in this dashboard or just above in this post. Here is a summary of these metrics as they stand now:  Many metrics, especially those revolving around delegation, point to increasing levels of decentralization It only takes the largest 3 entities to dominate any vote, which is certainly a decentralization concern Since April 2021, the effective number of MKR holders has been slightly declining, suggesting slightly decreasing decentralization  . Call to Action    Would it be worthwhile to regularly report these MKR decentralization metrics? If so, at what cadence?

In my opinion, the current Maker governance system is highly inefficient to protect against adverse selection and behavioural deviation. And this is extremely exacerbated by the high concentration. We have discussing a lot lately how to improve decision making internally, but not enough IMO how to improve the base layer of voting. I have had some fun recently in trying to model mathematically what happens in flat commingled systems of voters/ proponents like Maker.

It\u2019s very interesting he comes back to the HHI index as a measure of concentration - our team has had ideas for a generalized HHI metric in other settings related to measuring decentralization. I understand Vitalik\u2019s point that two identical quantitative measures of inequality can produce two very different outcomes. I imagine most attempts at reframing multi-variate problems into two principal components will probably end up having to choose their tradeoff. In the case of Gini, I think it probably works well if you don\u2019t try to extrapolate the impact and just look at measuring the distribution or dispersion of token holders. It\u2019s hard to argue it\u2019s anything other than very concentrated at the moment no matter how you look at it but the important data points will emerge when sampling these different measures over time.

It would be nice to compare Maker to other protocols in the space to see if this is a unique problem for Maker.   We could do that for MKR in LPs, but one problem is that MKR is borrowable as well so this would lead to negative balances of some wallets that borrow and send elsewhere. Our general approach is along the lines of \u201cnot your keys not your coins\u201d for simplicity - if any contract besides governance holds MKR on someone\u2019s behalf, we assume the contract owns those tokens. Another reason we choose this approach is that we are trying to measure the decentralization of governance power. If someone deposits 10K MKR into AAVE and another borrows AAVE\u2019s entire sum of MKR, the original depositor has effectively zero governance power & the borrower has it all. This can only be reflected with our current approach. CEX wallets are also a source of imperfection here. We\u2019ll look into the discrepancy, thanks for calling that out! And I agree that if we continue to use Gini Coefficient, context will help. We already thought to bring forth through time views but will also pull in the coefficients of other tokens.

                    "content": "@Patrick_J thanks for the great feedback:     Patrick_J:  Looking at the Dune query, it looks like you were able to link MKR held in Delegate contracts and the Chief to their originating wallet - this is great as it reflects the true source of the MKR. Were you also able to do this for MKR in LPs or deposited to other protocols such as Aave and Compound etc? If not, won\u2019t this skew the results?   The current query does not adjust for LP contracts like Aave and Compound (although as you point out you could have a version where you look through the Aave contracts). We have a version in process that could make this adjustment\u2013the issue is identifying all the correct LP contracts which is a work in progress. Edit: @lyt points out above that there are some issues with the look through:     lyt:  We could do that for MKR in LPs, but one problem is that MKR is borrowable as well so this would lead to negative balances of some wallets that borrow and send elsewhere. Our general approach is along the lines of \u201cnot your keys not your coins\u201d for simplicity        Patrick_J:  Looking at the Dune query for the GINI co-efficient, some of the numbers seem to be discrepant. Did you apply any grouping or normalising? For example, it lists the Pause Proxy as having 78,594.787 MKR tokens, but etherscan shows 77,801.08 (link ).   Thanks for the flag, I will check on this for you     Patrick_J:  Do you have any data on Gini coefficients for other DeFi tokens? It would be nice to compare Maker to other protocols in the space to see if this is a unique problem for Maker.   Yes, but we are holding off on releasing them to compare because we haven\u2019t done the work to isolate their treasury and delegation yet. We want them to be as close to like-for-like before releasing.     Patrick_J:  Finally, almost a year ago, Vitalik published an interesting post about the pitfalls of using Gini co-efficient in the crypto context - link  for anyone that\u2019s interested. I\u2019d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you have time.   I read the article when building this query\u2013I don\u2019t disagree with Vitalik\u2019s main points, namely the coefficient obscures concentration of power vs. lack of resources and it is difficult to compare when participation is optional (ownership of a specific asset in an economy) vs. effectively required (participation in an economy). For our purposes, I think this metric is most useful when used to understand how our own Gini has changed over time vs. comparisons to real world economies. ",

I would love to get a discussion started about how many votes would be sufficient for the Maker community to say the voting is sufficiently decentralized and the reasoning behind this number. The changes could also be based on minority protection, quorum requirements, or the way we count votes. You conclude that: Since April 2021, the effective number of MKR holders has been slightly declining, suggesting slightly decreasing decentralization I would like to have the number of MKR holders actually voting visualized instead of the number of holders that are able to vote, as this might be a better metric. Call to action I voted it not worthwhile to report on a fixed basis, however I find the work very helpful. I would rather prefer to see this reporting when something of important changes, like bells and whistles when some predefined thresholds are passed. This would create a better kind of attention than when doing time-scheduled posting, IMO. ",
