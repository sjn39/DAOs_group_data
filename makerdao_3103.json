                    "content": "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the Maker Community Not a creature was stirring, not even LongForWisdom, or Anon\u2019s like @Bit; The Executive Vote hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. @NikKunkel soon would be there; The Working Groups with Lady Anna, Blimpa, Lozadaluis12 were nestled all snug in their beds; While visions of DAI Yield Farms danced in @monet-supply head; And @amyjung in her 'kerchief, and Juan in his cap, Had just settled their brains for a long winter\u2019s nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, @brianmcmichael sprang from his bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window @Kurt_Barry flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, SebVentures gave a lustre of midday to objects below, When what to Payton Rose 11 wondering eyes did appear, But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer, With a little old driver named Chris Mooney so lively and quick, Wil knew in a moment he must be St. TBone! More rapid than Jernejml, UltraSchuppi and @williamr their coursers they came, And they whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: \u201cNow, @equivrel! now, David_Meister! now @doo and @Planet_X! On @Akiva! on, @Zenithlight! on, Cryptouf and rema! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now Vote away! Vote away! Vote away all!\u201d As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When Maker Community is met with an obstacle, they mount to the sky; Rally the Community with Charles St. Louis, Derek Flossman, Bri \u201cthe Dream\u201d 174 @Andy_McCall and up to the Vote.Makerdao.com the coursers they flew With the sleigh full of Maker, Smaugho, Reuptaken, @twblack88 and @vshvsh too\u2014 And then, in a twinkling, Davidutro heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As ejbarraza, Alberto Sonsol, Mario, Aaron_Bartsch, and KhanMaker drew in their heads, and were turning around, Down the chimney Rune came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of DAI his partner G-DIP flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. From a corner hexonaut noticed his eyes\u2014how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry! And Alexis noticed Rune\u2019s cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe @mrabino1 held tight in his teeth, Bringing RWA all the way down to his feet, And the smoke, it encircled @replenish2030 head like a wreath; His helper iammeeoh had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. His helper @Spin was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And he laughed when @_LS saw him, in spite of himself; A wink by Lix and his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave Jiecut the know there was nothing to dread; @psychonaut spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And Primoz filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney they rose; Wouter sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But Orlanta3 heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight\u2014 \u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\u201d It\u2019s 4:52PM East Coast Standard Time in the U.S. of A. We need 1,976.38 MKR to pass the latest Executive Vote\u2013Activate the USDC PSM Will you be our Christmas Hero and Vote to Activate? PSM\u2013Community developed and onboarded.
