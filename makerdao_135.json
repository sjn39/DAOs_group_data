                    "content": "@rich.brown I\u2019m new to this community and just watched the recording of the call. During the Q&A you brought up the GSM vote and whether or not there should be a limit on whether or not votes should be repeatable. I really think that there are three important layers to that question:  Can and should we vote on the GSM again? Should we limit the number of times that a question can be put up for a vote? How do we create and enforce rules like the number of times a question can be put up for a vote?  The conversation on the call covered this, but my sense of #1 is that there\u2019s currently no rule against putting something up for a vote twice, so if there is a group that wants to put this item up again they can. I think the questions get more interesting at #2 because there isn\u2019t a clear answer to #3. In traditional democratic systems, there\u2019s a foundational set of rules (constitution) that includes the instructions to change the rules. Do we already have something that serves that purpose? If not, how would we come up with something? ",

One thing we know is that Governance is critical to the future of the protocol and ecosystem. The Foundation sees this need and will be contributing significantly more resources towards Governance.  That means more foundation members on this call, and we get to introduce them here and explore ways to improve all our processes.    Internally, sophisticated tooling and procedures are currently in place. We\u2019re continuing on the mission of gradual decentralization. As we create this ecosystem for the commons, we want to cultivate a community of folks with a healthy culture who are capable and interested in taking control of the Maker Protocol.   We need to become the reference implementation of \u2018Governance in the Crypto space.\u2019 I would say we\u2019re halfway there to having governance that can bring us into the next few generations of what the protocol will evolve into.  We started with: How do we do Governance? When do we talk? How do we communicate? We\u2019ve continuously iterated, and now here we are with proposals, forums, chats, portals, votes, and the reality of crypto media coverage. Governance has been bootstrapped; it\u2019s here. A part of that auditing phase that I mentioned earlier is to take Governance to the next level. Making it an efficient decentralized machine that engages people in the best way it can.    There are two new faces on the call.   Derek Flossman, Product Manager(PM) at the Foundation. He\u2019s our Governance PM. Making sure the community requirements and foundation response to those is a tight feedback loop.   Charles St. Louis, a technical consultant at Maker Foundation. He does deep thinking around processes and is going to be bringing dedicated resources to that discussion.     Give us feedback about the call.   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Intro and Current Governance Development Backlog 6:08 Derek and Charles We\u2019re going to briefly introduce ourselves and get into the Emergency Shutdown Module progress to date.  1469\u00d7798 86.1 KB   1465\u00d7740 195 KB   1450\u00d7770 122 KB    Derek: My role is to be the glue between the different groups involved in developing and designing these products and tools.   This is not an all-encompassing review, but I felt it was enough to get you to understand a bit about what product management involves and who we work with in the Foundation.   To give you a further visual, let\u2019s walk through the ESM.    1460\u00d7753 166 KB   1446\u00d7697 101 KB   We all know ESM at a high level. It\u2019s a crucial security feature that allows the system to shut down by staking and burning 50K MKR. Currently, this tool exists in the CLI, and the goal is to make an interface in the Modules dropdown.   1475\u00d7739 117 KB    Soon this interface will look like the above. Clear to the user, especially the severity of the impact on the system as a whole.   We\u2019ve put an emphasis on making the severity of the actions a user takes on this page very clear through the language and messaging in the UI.    1407\u00d7697 104 KB   1479\u00d7674 105 KB   1491\u00d7716 117 KB   Explicit confirmation with the phrase, \u201cBurn your MKR in the ESM.\u201d Just to really make clear that the user will lose their MKR.   1491\u00d7765 124 KB   The above example includes a 1K MKR burn with only one user in the system, as seen in the deposit history on the page.   1418\u00d7689 117 KB   At the 50K MKR threshold, you can see the button above; anyone can trigger ES. Anyone can see the page regardless of whether they hold MKR or not. At this point, anyone with a crypto wallet could initiate the shutdown.   1424\u00d7742 126 KB   1501\u00d7754 141 KB   These are the steps to initiate ES. Note the banner at the top where Governance will post calls for meeting on the next steps. I\u2019m just illustrating the steps to initiate the shutdown.   1428\u00d7720 91.9 KB   Above are the next steps that the devs are currently working on. Referencing a lot of the feedback from the past few weeks. There is some excellent feedback about what different edge cases look like that we can build into the experience. I also have the MIPs process here, and we\u2019ll be engaging the community around that framework. I\u2019ve included delegation voting since I think that will fit in with recent discussions.   1019\u00d7524 89.1 KB    Links from above slide:   Community Emergency Shutdown Q&A   Emergency Shutdown Module at Docs.Makerdao   Maker Protocol Shutdown   ES Command Line Interface     Questions and Discussion 15:40   Rich: Is the ESM UI for MCD, SCD, Both? Does this work for SCD?   Derek: This is for MCD. To shutdown Sai, an Executive Vote would be needed.   Ben: So it\u2019s going to cost MKR holders to shut down MCD. But to shut down SCD, it\u2019s just a regular vote without burning MKR.   Derek: Correct   David: Am I correct that you could shut down MCD through an Executive Vote to bypass the 50K MKR burning?   Nik: Correct. The ESM is a module designed to sidestep the need for an Executive Vote.     17:36   Rich: There\u2019s a significant infrastructure need, is there an idea when the ESM UI goes live?  Derek: The functionality that you\u2019ve seen is on the current sprint, so expect it to be ready sometime next month. I\u2019m currently working, in parallel, on collateral redemption. So in the event of an Emergency Shutdown, both for SCD and MCD, what does that process look like? We\u2019ll have the wireframes and the breakdown for the procedure. Mostly to address the questions I\u2019ve seen for individual users. E.G., \u201cI\u2019m a Dai holder, I need to claim collateral, what do I do?\u201d    Risk Primoz Kordez Analysis 20:48  899\u00d7657 135 KB    Migration pace has been picked up over this last week. ~9.3 million more Dai, ~4.6 million less Sai. Net total supply of Sai+Dai increased by 5 million in the last week.  The increase may correspond to Eth price increase and leverage the behavior of CDP borrowers.     1522\u00d7470 73.6 KB    There are some users still minting Sai. These may be market makers speculating and trying to capture the premium due to a lower Sai supply. There is also an arbitrage due to the 1% difference on the spread - This week, there was a change in rates to 5% Stability Fee in SCD and a DSR of 6% in MCD.  As the amount of Sai decreases, it will get tougher to get out of SCD up until there is a Shutdown(ES).      ~14.5 million Sai minted last month. I\u2019m surprised to see so much Sai borrowed with these younger CDP\u2019s; most likely speculators.   811\u00d7336 70.1 KB   Sai liquidity is pretty low. In Uniswap, the only venue that\u2019s liquid now, there are only 600,000 Sai there. This is only 2% of the total Sai supply. What\u2019s worrying is that there are really no other venues.     Oasis used to be the prime venue for the old ETH to DAI(SAI) market. Now, if you want to buy SAI with W-ETH on Oasis, you will encounter a large spread, almost 10%.  High slippage on Sai trading is good for Dai since it makes it more attractive to migrate. It\u2019s not so good for remaining Sai holders.     1011\u00d7296 224 KB    The above screenshot is for the SCD system only.   The combined amount of Eth locked as collateral for both MCD and SCD is roughly 2.4 million ETH. This is an all-time high.  The MCD CR is up to 294% percent due to the ETH price increase. The SCD CR is now at 266%. This is much safer than before, as there was a time in December when the collateralization was only around 200%.     882\u00d7161 33.2 KB   Dai in DSR is up to an all-time high of 44%. This was mainly because of Compound integrating DSR for its unutilized Dai. In Compound, unutilized Dai sits at about 10 million; this Dai is now in DSR.     Looking at Compound\u2019s SAI markets, there are still 5 million Sai left. I was hoping to see this figure go down faster. Though there wasn\u2019t a large incentive for this number to go down this week because the spread between Sai and Dai lending is 3%, up from 1%.   I\u2019m assuming that some of this Sai supply should switch to Dai through migration contracts unless these users are speculators trying to catch a premium if there\u2019s a Sai liquidity crunch.    1494\u00d7736 445 KB    Lastly, I did some analysis of remaining Sai holders and borrowers.   Remaining Sai in top 100 wallets have 27 million of Sai, roughly 77% of Sai in existence. These include the Uniswap Pool and Compound cSai.   Currently, about 200-300 users still hold the majority of Sai, 80-90%.   6.9 million Sai, 20% of current supply, is sitting in wallets that have been inactive for at least 365 days. Some percentage of this Sai is likely lost.   On the borrower\u2019s side, the 100 top Sai CDPs hold almost 90% of all debt.   The number 1 largest CDP has had no interaction with the system for about six months and has accrued about 800,00 in fees. This represents roughly 1/3rd of all current outstanding fees.   Next, we look at the last activity type for these top 100 CDPs.   Migration was likely bound by liquidity and by the Sai available in the migration contract.  Both the Wipe(paying Dai back) and Free(unlocking collateral) wallet activities are limited by liquidity in the migration contract.    Many users were adding additional ETH as collateral because the ETH price dropped mid-December, and they wanted to protect their CDPs.   May CDP\u2019s are still drawing Sai, some of which were opened during migration. We need to keep an eye on how many of the old borrowers migrated so far. It is misleading to consider old users as not migrating when there is considerable drawing activity by newer CDPs.   40 of these top 100 wallets have not interacted with their CDPs since MCD launch/migration.  This represents 15 million in debt, which is about almost half of the debt of these 100 CDPs.       1504\u00d7485 82.1 KB   Some pick up in fees being paid yesterday, mostly in MKR for payment.  Questions and Discussion 31:49  1494\u00d7736 445 KB    David: What is the time period for this top 100 SCD/CDPs activity structure?   Primoz: This is a snapshot of the wallet\u2019s last activity. As the table shows only their last activity type, it\u2019s difficult to draw conclusions about overall behavior.   David: So Each CDP gets one input in this data?   Primoz: Correct.     33:42   Rich: You talked about how Uniswap is the last useful liquidity provider. What happens when that gets down to the dregs? What are the indicators that we can use to determine whether SCD is no longer healthy?   Primoz: The Peg is the best indicator. When you see some big trades over $1 when Sai is trading above the peg.   Rich: it\u2019ll be interesting to see what the last rush to the exit will look like.   JoeQ: The Foundation keeps some Sai in reserves in case things get out of line.     Vishesh State of the Peg 35:45 Relevant links Dai Peg Graphs MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Insights  1406\u00d7694 123 KB   1094\u00d7684 182 KB    Solid 24 hr trading volumes for Dai, 3.2 million over the last day. Currently, the peg is centered around $1. In the last week, there was a dip, but it has recovered to around $1.   Oasis captured most of this volume, sitting at the center of that spread.   dYdx picking up in volume.   Coinbase sees more of a spread, which means worse slippage on their market. Unclear why that is happening, usually they sit in the middle of the price graph.      1397\u00d7700 105 KB    Tiny trading volumes on the Sai markets, 150k over the last day.   Sai is holding steady in regards to the peg.   Uniswap is dominating on whatever is left of Sai volume.   The total amount of Sai is emptying out; the remaining volume is likely due to market makers looking to make last-minute trades.    777\u00d7667 114 KB    On MCD, top vaults reflect no major changes. CRs have not moved in any significant way.   Migration is proceeding, the total amount of MCD has increased, while the total amount of SCD has decreased as Primoz mentioned earlier already.    1374\u00d7642 65.2 KB    Collateralization Ratios are still relatively low (for ETH Vaults) in MCD.   That said, this may have more to do with ETH price than it does with changes in people\u2019s risk tolerance of MCD vs. SCD.  It is likely that the migration from SCD to MCD refreshed the amount of collateral the overall pool wants to have compared to the overall amount of debt.      Questions to Vishesh 41:52   Makerman: Shouldn\u2019t we proceed with aligning SCD-SF to MCD-SF to eliminate the 1% spread?  Vishesh: I think that\u2019s something for people to discuss. I\u2019m not sure that that is a huge driver of user behavior at this point. Theoretically, doable, and I don\u2019t necessarily see a problem with keeping this small spread for now, but I don\u2019t think it will make a huge difference.    LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 44:07   Governance at a Glance Thread   A Governance Model for Maker  Hexonaut/Sam had done his presentation last week, and the discussion has continued about it in this forum thread.

                    "content": "2/2 General Discussion 43:22  Rich: We have a signal request here in the forums about whether to replace the weekly DSR polls with a question about spread instead.  47:08  David: The topic of bundling votes relates closely to one of the main concepts in Sam\u2019s presentation: one vote one function. I just wanted to point out the conceptual connection there.  49:37   Rich: I\u2019d like to dig into the concept of failed votes. Particularly in regards to what happened with the GSM vote.   To recap: a blog post went out that made a significant amount of noise with regards to the lack of a governance delay. It argued that MKR voters needed to secure the system against a governance attack by implementing a delay sooner rather than later. The attack, in a nutshell, was a realization that with skin in the game, if you have a ridiculous amount of money, you can buy votes and do whatever you want.   After the flurry of activity in the community, an opportunity to vote for a delay through the GSM occurred. At the same time, several large holders moved their MKR into the voting system to secure the current status quo, which made voting in the delay that much more difficult. As a result, the GSM delay wasn\u2019t ratified. It couldn\u2019t gather enough MKR in support to exceed the previous vote.   What do we do now? Do we say \u201cwe should have voted in the GSM, the world was wrong\u201d or \u201cGSM didn\u2019t ratify, the community didn\u2019t want it, so move on.\u201d In this situation, what do we want to do? Should we resurface the GSM every week until it happens? And, what is the process for a re-vote?     54:06   Matthew: I would assume that a non-passed vote gets cycled through again. We should have a cadence for the different types of Executive Votes, perhaps bifurcated. Every other week is Monetary policy, and the other week would be for administrative items like Risk teams or GSM-style updates. If something fails to pass, then we wait on forum consensus and another Executive Vote.   Rich: That still assumes some group of people that say one group is wrong, and one group has to get it right.   Matthew: Not necessarily, only if there is consensus in the forums.   David: Mariano explained last week that eventually, we do need the delay not to be zero. It would make sense to cycle this specific one.   Rich: True, it\u2019s been on the roadmap for 3+ years. It\u2019s in the white paper. We explained the need for a short delay on launch. It was supposed to bundle with Instant Action Modules and other guard rails like the OSM etc. The Foundation doesn\u2019t want to let this go; we just have to decide how to resurface issues. Also, the more significant question of who owns it and brings this back into question.   Matthew: I would view it much like the bureaucracy to get a bill passed or of any democratic campaigning. In this case, the social consensus of a forum then polling. It just slows down and adds inertia to the process of voting for all of us in probably a positive way. A possibility where monetary policy gets spread out unless an emergency pops up. If the GSM has enough community consensus, then it will find itself back on a poll.   Rich: Ideally, that\u2019s correct. We need campaigns, lobbyists maybe. It\u2019s human nature, but crypto itself has this bad habit of a big honking EMERGENCY every three months, and the ecosystem rears its head in response. Even within MakerDAO Governance, there is a microcosm of this. We make a little fix, the clouds pass, and then it\u2019s sunny again until the next \u201curgent\u201d issue comes.     58:55   David: Does it make sense to bucket out and expand the cadence schedule of the Executive Votes? Something closer to a bi-weekly cadence on a monthly cycle would make sense. Different types of votes could be handled on their designated weeks. If an emergency arises, then we could supersede non-emergency votes, resolve the issue, and move back to the scheduled cadence.  Rich: Good point, cadence is a big issue. I think I made an 80 point list of the governance challenges. That diverted into Monetary Policy as a weekly cadence or not. Also not grandfathering in cultural norms from SCD. Now that we have more resources, we can evolve this.    1:01:25   David: Rich, can you expand on the Governance Poll going out tomorrow on Monday, relevant to Sam\u2019s thread.   Rich: To clarify, Sam\u2019s thing goes out on Monday as a poll. Sam is the exception to the rule: He came up with an idea, made a plan, spent effort in the threads, fostered the idea, created a proposal, made a slide deck, etc. That\u2019s a significant amount of work and dedication. Is that what it takes to make things happen in this ecosystem? If so, is that a reasonable expectation for governance participants at large?   David: I think it comes down establishing a community-understood bucketing and cadence system.   Rich: I was bucketing already (Polling Policy, Monetary Policy, and the increasing need for Technical Votes). Determining which buckets votes fall into and which ones require consensus or changes to the system, Sam\u2019s is a poll that fits under Polling Policy.     1:04:14   JoeQ: We have to get moving on new collateral types, so we can increase the decentralization of the underlying collateral portfolio, and we have the income from the other collateral types. Hopefully, a goal would be 500 $Million by the EOY, but we need new collateral types.   Rich: That ties nicely to the extra resources we\u2019re being given to evolve Governance. Onboarding collateral types require efficient onboarding.   David: Is the next step another asset priority poll?   Rich: We still have the previous list. Risk teams in the next few weeks will have additional insight into what\u2019s next. A significant amount of docs, tools, and presentations to share over the coming months. Once those are out of the way, we can kick off a more regular governance cycle, as we\u2019ve been mentioning.   A quick refresher: We\u2019re in limbo right now with MCD, SCD, and the migration period, all inter-related. During the migration period, Monetary Policy helps us navigate the risks and complexity but is handled differently than when SCD is eventually deprecated. Now that we have more resources, post-MCD, we can spin off and focus more on regulating our processes, which includes collateral onboarding.     1:07:47   Xenofon: \u201cIf governance is that important to the system, the Foundation should hire people to make high-quality proposals.\u201d   Rich: I can speak to that. The Foundation is here to bootstrap the core protocol, smart contracts, and then provide reference implementations for the governance process and other processes necessary to run the protocol. We encourage the ecosystem to use these implementations, iterate on them, and eventually take control from the Foundation.   I\u2019m an example of a reference implementation as an Interim Governance Facilitator. Ideally, I step away, and a new person is elected to take this position.   Similarly, we used only to have the CDP portal, now we have Instadapp, Zerion, MyEtherWallet, and multiple third-party access points. We hope to provide the governance community with the tools it needs to be self-sustaining.     The idea is: yes, we need work, campaign, and think about the system. That requires time and energy that requires incentives. We\u2019ve been discussing guardians for a long time. As MCD is chugging along, it collects fees. As the buffer fills with fees, that can go towards paying the ecosystem to do things. People who can contribute in a structured and transparent way will be compensated. Until that mechanism is in place, the Foundation foots the bill. The primary source of quality proposals is through stakeholders themselves.   David: TL;DR: we agree that we need people to do high-quality work, they\u2019re compensated, and we are building towards doing that sustainably as a DAO.   Rich: Right, that\u2019s the future of the protocol and ecosystem. Identify actors in the ecosystem, empower them to make things happen, and make sure they get fed. Identifiable actors. Where X needs to happen, and Y is the best candidate to achieve the goal.   David: The chat-comments are crystallizing around a reward system, incentivizing high quality.   Rich: Something I\u2019ve been interested in for a long time. How do we reward people when it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cI want to do X,\u201d in that case you just pay them and that\u2019s how business works. If you put a crypto spin on it, how do we reward people for being right? Staking, rewards, and discussion on those ideas I\u2019d love to hear. Something along the lines of \u201crisk team X presented this to happen in the next six months,\u201d we can slash or reward based on the report.     1:16:03   Vishesh: It is a scary world where we turn this into some strange kind of betting market. Incentivizing based on predictive accuracy or something. Anyway, I was thinking about how a tech company would approach this in the traditional world. Imagine this whole system becomes an AI program that\u2019s job is managing the system well and managing it efficiently.   You would define goals.   You would make a fitness function, definitively saying this is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s based on maximizing revenues or based on risk indices. Or even public sentiment.   You could think about how to score the system based on a set of values. Manage the system to optimize for those values, tell it to judge itself on that set of values/benchmark/rule-book. Manage the system to optimize for those values, maximizing efficiency, reducing variance, and the least amount of overall costs.   You decide those negative values as well. Value is essentially  \u201coutput for cost.\u201d You figure out how to measure and then optimize costs.   It\u2019s oversimplified Governance, but the goal is to find out a system to maximize value differently. Maybe some pieces are optimized towards practical outputs, perhaps Rich or a Governance coordinator. Possibly other parts are minimizing the denominator. The point of risk is about costs.   Again, approaching this like a tech company in a risk-driven business: how would they organize to solve these problems? They would hire a set of analysts to make sure there is a mechanism in place that is well equipped to solve a problem. Like a business unit who has skin in the game, accomplishing a goal. They produce a reliable output on a predictable and dependable cadence.   Usually, there is buy-in with this like salaries, stock, etc., that business unit has skin in the game and supplies the analytical, data science, or technical resource typically. The performance of that resource is determined by the satisfaction of those business units with the resources they have on hand. E.G., \u201cHead of the BD dept goes to the CEO and says I\u2019m satisfied or not.\u201d Satisfaction with the performance of that resource is how that resource is judged. Instead of reinventing the wheel all the time, we can draw from how things work in the traditional world. Avoiding reinvention and over-complication.     1:20:51   Rich: I agree completely; It\u2019s not oversimplifying; it just adds a necessary level of complexity to the system. We began at: \"Launch and don\u2019t break \" then \u201claunch and stabilize peg.\u201d Essentially moving beyond technical requirements into business ones. Making \u201cnumber stay the same, as opposed to up and down\u201d is our current place. Who is going to own that transition and lead the charge to implement more traditional business practices here?   Derek: Going to echo Vishesh, focusing on the outcomes here that aren\u2019t just for completing epics or paths. It ties back to the Foundation and community. Bottom-up and top-down. Using OKR\u2019s and making sure they\u2019re measurable. That concept is a step in the right direction.   Vishesh: Right, with OKRs, functions have owners.   Rich: That\u2019s key.   Vishesh: At the end of the day, the system crawls towards results in line with your values. That\u2019s the tightest corollary to a business unit. I assume that there would be a unit that drives good governance outcomes. Defining, in conjunction with the community, what good outcomes are.   Rich: You hit the nail on the head. Identifying and empowering actors, defining, and incentivizing them. Then we have an environment of responsibility. Right now, it\u2019s an amorphous group of people casting votes through a web portal.   Vishesh: This conversation might end up crashing against delegated voting.   Rich: Decentralization in general.   LongForWisdom: Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean no structure at all; we can have structure.   JoeQ: Exactly, Rich has done well, keeping everything structured. We\u2019ve gotten this far. We just have to figure out a proper structure moving forward.   Rich: I lead nothing! I will facilitate, though. Hopefully, leaders emerge, which means less work for me.     1:26:43   Rich: We do need to begin to talk about the ramp-up. These topics have come up internally and externally and have gone through iterations. First, it was a community, then guardians, now \u201cDAO teams\u201d are the newest terminology. We need to create those reference implementations, those models, and incentives aligned for the system.   An example is, finding other governance facilitators in different geographic areas. Bringing them online, making a committee, working together for a bit, then I can step back. Risk teams need to expand, and the model is evolving. Maybe Vishesh will lead the business team paying him on the outcomes.   Vishesh: I pre-empted you. That\u2019s an excellent wrong example right there. We need a layer that exists outside of risk teams, not one person, that makes a call on \u201cwhat resource to use when\u201d \u201cwhat resource to use,\u201d \u201cwhat answer is wrong.\u201d You need a layer with skin in the game to identify which answers are \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d   Rich: I wasn\u2019t suggesting that risk teams would make calls like that, apologies for my facetiousness, I\u2019ll clarify. These \u201cDAO teams\u201d come up with tooling, methodologies, frameworks, and set the stage for decision making. Just like interim Governance facilitators aren\u2019t here to say \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that.\u201d It\u2019s the community\u2019s job to source empowered actors.   Rich: \u201cRisk makes the sharp tool, and someone else has to wield them.\u201d     1:31:51   David: Is there development around an active governance calendar? Something lightweight that anyone can add?   Rich: Can you clarify maintenance?   David: Like a governance calendar with expected votes coming up. A central reference point for the community.   Rich: This is where we run into discoverability. If you click on the dates, it should open a google calendar. That\u2019s an excellent comm_dev discoverability thing. Added link to the sidebar.

                    "content": "I find the biggest challenge here to be the contextual nature of the answers to these questions. For one, it depends on what the vote is even about. To create a full framework or constitution around this will take time, and will require flexibility from the governance community. For the GSM delay I think it\u2019s easy:  Yes, we should. The delay is important existentially, and this was just a question of \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cshould we do it at all\u201d  In general my answer to the other two are:   No, we shouldn\u2019t. Arbitrarily locking ourselves out of important options is the risk here. Besides, the public sentiment and forum signal is ultimately what gets issues to go on-chain. For something to be re-polled it would have to go through the process of gathering signal again.   We create processes and policy through discourse and signal seeking in the forums. Eventually we can solidify rules by ratifying them through Governance Polls. However, all the reasoning has to happen beforehand in a public and transparent manner.   ",

DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM  We hit the debt ceiling this week. The community empowered an actor to work on behalf of the community by electing an Interim Governance Facilitator, namely me, to take action around specific decisions in regards to proposals and votes.  The poll that enabled a $10 million buffer on top of the Debt Ceiling took a month of debate to arrive at. Unfortunately, it seems like $10 million is not enough, judging by how quickly it was broken through in the last few days. Enabling the Interim Governance Facilitator to place an executive in the system when the buffer is breached without needing an additional Governance Poll worked. But it also raised the question: How will we have a flexible system that adapts to unexpected situations? E.G., What happens if we need 20 million or more in the course of a week? What happens if the Debt Ceiling is at risk in a few blocks? We have a proposal currently that doesn\u2019t grab all the outlier cases or \u2018what if\u2019s.\u2019 Specific language about the debt ceilings cap is intentionally ambiguous, and we want to be careful about governance actors in the face of changing need(s). This discussion point: \u201cwhy are we waiting?\u201d comes up again and again. The worry with acting too quickly is the additional questions it raises. E.G., What qualifies an emergency? Who determines what that emergency is? Crisis for whom? How do we get more eyes from the community on the decision we need to make? Previously our cadence was weekly and reliable. Monday poll, Friday executive, etc. combined with homework we ask of the ecosystem. As governance continues to need more agility or emergency powers, there has to be a middle ground where we can have a sense of urgency on the executive without forgoing due process. One suggestion is firing up an executive right after this regularly scheduled call, giving everyone a day to respond and deliver. This action feels best and isn\u2019t an abuse of power.   We need to perform an audit of our governance: Our processes and mechanisms, weekly cadence, tooling, polls, and other pain points. In two weeks, we\u2019ll have quite a few parameters to manage, alongside two debt ceilings from two ecosystems. Let\u2019s get a forum post, a working group, or mini initiative going to make sure we get this right and improve our agility and effectiveness.  In this case, with the debt ceiling, it worked out, but the more significant issue is that stress fractures in governance will become more evident as MCD arrives.    Risk Cyrus Today we\u2019re talking about auctions and migration risk. Migration Risk Brief Review 14:32  Vf8PJ8O.jpg2011\u00d71116 123 KB   The overarching risk theme was SAI liquidity both for CDP owners sourcing SAI to migrate but also, more importantly, the secondary borrowers who might not use the migration contract. Sourcing SAI in the public markets shouldn\u2019t be a problem as this starts. However, eventually, when liquidity dries up for SAI, then the ES will need to be triggered. See last week\u2019s call for a more comprehensive overview of the migrations risks.  Auctions 17:08  MzWVono.png2001\u00d71068 172 KB  18:04  ZQTOvzu.png1401\u00d7615 75.6 KB   Auctions in a blockchain world are a little complex. There are compelling arguments for not having GUI\u2019s at the beginning. Auctions can happen at any moment, 24 hours a day. It makes the most sense for automated bots to participate in the auctions.  20:41  wzj1glW.jpg2006\u00d71066 187 KB   Keepers do have to bid for the entire lot size of an auction. Large liquidations will be broken down into multiple auctions. The larger the lot size, the longer the auction would take, which is the downside.  Lot size and bid duration are the most interesting from a game-theoretic perspective. An example that highlights the importance of the bid duration is if someone comes into an auction with a bid duration set to one hour. That\u2019s an hour of market risk that they might price into their bids as a discount, underbidding the auction. Thus, the Maker Protocol receives less DAI. The other detail is that if the set bid duration is too small, then you run into network risk (high gas costs, full blocks, downtime, etc.) A minimum bid increment too low means that last-minute keepers can come in for a low cost and win the bids with a very small increased offer.  26:12  6ogLtIL.png1229\u00d7594 95.5 KB   This is an example of a collateral auction for a liquidated CDP. A keeper liquidated the CDP once it is below the Liquidation Ratio. The liquidation penalty is then applied to the total Dai borrowed. Collateral auctions have two phases. In the first, participants bid on the entire lot of collateral up until the required Dai needed to cover the liquidated CDP. The second phase occurs once the amount of required Dai is reached, then the auction locks in the bids and begins a reverse auction where bidders compete for how much less collateral they are willing to accept for their bids.  31:12  G8kEsqQ.png959\u00d7506 53.6 KB   ~$10,000 Lot size is an amount we feel is balanced. It\u2019s large enough not to cause thousands of little auctions while being small enough that relatively any keeper doing this seriously should be able to absorb. 10-minute bid duration is a middle ground between network issues and market risk. The minimum bid increment is meant to mimic the current SCD discount structure on collateral sales. E.G., If someone comes close to 97% of the collateral amount, then it\u2019s not rational to outbid them; this increment guarantees that 3% profit.  32:43  XtFeIPd.png1181\u00d7557 100 KB   Surplus Auctions should happen uniformly when SF\u2019s are collected. In surplus auctions, bidders lose when MKR rallies since their bid denominated in MKR is an exchange from MKR to Dai.  35:30  ELGyOh9.png1201\u00d7462 69.3 KB  36:17  ANQ129d.png1024\u00d7492 42.8 KB  40:36  JfGjxKX.png1196\u00d7582 83.2 KB   Earlier, we didn\u2019t implement a maximum on closing the debt. If there was some amount small amount of bad debt, even as low as a dollar, a keeper could come in to bail out the shortfall for 1 DAI and in return, ask for 1 trillion MKR. The protocol will now impose a limit depending on the size of the debt.  42:46  JqCsv1R.png1205\u00d7577 120 KB   Including the maximum initial bid is like a reverse auction.  45:57  osq3z61.png891\u00d7494 60.7 KB   Fairly recently, we increased the lot size to accommodate an edge case. During the migration, if a bunch of SAI holders migrates to earn the DSR, but no CDP owners have moved yet, there could be a shortfall in stability fees triggering one of these debt auctions.  47:07  PIS4zm7.png1046\u00d7537 74.3 KB   The poll issues were my fault, and we do need to come to a consensus on a short-term solution and future mitigation of this happening again. Technically governance voted on an incomplete set of parameters. Unfortunately, due to the second issue, the best option is to run a new Poll on Monday. We can\u2019t launch an Executive with parameters that are different than the governance poll. We\u2019ll need to run another one with the missing parameter.  Questions and Discussion 19:40  Rich: Could you elaborate on a compelling reason for no GUI\u2019s on the auctions?  Cyrus: A lot of these are designed for market makers because they have access to deeper liquidity reserves. There is no pre-set time for auctions, and they can trigger at any time of day, which is better for automated bots.    26:12  PatrickD: Is there documentation available for average traders who understand ETH too?  Cyrus: Yes, there is plenty of documentation available. There are even open-source auction bots. Links:  auctions-101 auction-keeper      29:57  Rich: Maybe this a question for the engineers, but is there a name for this type of auction?  Cyrus: English auction, I believe. It\u2019s what everyone is familiar with when they think of options(bids increasing on the price of the shortfall). The tricky part is the inversion of the recovered collateral, how much \u201cthey are willing to walk away with.\u201d There are resources for this and endless amounts of research on the topic.    37:10  Lawson: In the bidding auction process, is there locking of the DAI in that time frame necessary to purchase it?  Cyrus: In the surplus auction, the DAI is what you\u2019re bidding on. The protocol has the reserve pool where it collects the DAI from liquidations. Lawson: To clarify, whatever the asset is your purchasing with, is there locking of that asset once you submit your bid? Cyrus: You\u2019ll bid some amount of MKR and then it\u2019s permanently locked until you win or someone outbids you Lawson: If there are multiple bids for the same amount, how is that managed? First in line or\u2026? Cyrus: Correct, it\u2019s first in line since each new bid has to hit the minimum bid increment. Lawson: I liken this to where you receive bids for assets that are all the same but just for differing amounts. It seems like there could be an approach for bidding that includes \u201cI\u2019m willing to pay this amount more or less.\u201d Also, a parameter for a reputation for keepers while creating the order book. I.E., \u201cwhat has this person done with me recently.\u201d These parameters would fit a process in the future where it would look at those and share equally while accounting for regular keepers. It feels like a process where you\u2019re trying to account for multiple people in similar bids. Cyrus: Agree on that process, and that\u2019s a great point. These parameters are subject to change, as well. The choice of parameters has a significant impact on auctions, so we need to standardize these numbers before building that system of reputation.    Sai Analysis Vishesh 58:46 Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights 58:46  MoFy0uj.png1213\u00d7749 261 KB   We hit the debt ceiling. Supply exploded. Since Nov 04th, we saw roughly $10 million DAI minted.   hTM3msB.png1033\u00d7545 108 KB   Total borrow volume drastically dropped, $13 million between DyDx and Compound. Couple large mintings on the 4th and the 6th did not make their way directly onto the market. Which begs the question:  How is it being used? It\u2019s possible people are just holding onto it for the migration.   Not all of what\u2019s been going on has been explained by refinancing.   NP1uZiq.png1374\u00d7722 108 KB   Supply volume has remained steady. It\u2019s not clear that the recent new DAI was sold onto the market or supplied on SLPs.   uLXwrWL.jpg1378\u00d7688 120 KB   We\u2019ve been talking about this buffer between the stability fee and the Compound borrow rate. It\u2019s been interesting to watch, and because the fee dropped from 12% to 10% to 9% to 5%, the Compound borrow rate remained steady between 13% to 11.5%. Then, on the 4th, it dropped about 1.5% because the volume dropped from 22 million to 16 million. 12 out of 22 million, which is a significant portion.   MgMBzoM.png1386\u00d7687 125 KB   24HR VWAP. Despite the large mintings of DAI, we didn\u2019t see the price immediately crater. This indicates that the new DAI didn\u2019t make it to the market.  More or less stable on the peg and not a lot of volume across exchanges.   1TmNpqM.png1398\u00d7624 149 KB   7D VWAP Volume overall 7-day is lower than usual, only 9.93 million. Prices are stable as usual. Uniswap has some volume towards the lower end, likely due to slippage. Obviously, some DAI sold on the market. Liquidity crunch may be coming, so maybe people are holding to prepare for that. Curious about the stability during that. It will be unclear whether it will sell for other collateral or a profit.   nlipkcz.png1390\u00d7683 115 KB   DyDx and Compound utilization rates are down too.   TcVWk5J.png813\u00d7344 64.6 KB   CDP collateral went up, and in the grand scheme of things, the time frame from July to December was a dip in debt. Not sure how sustained this 10 million growth will be.   H5oaOHL.png1379\u00d7712 117 KB   One thing we haven\u2019t spoken about for a while is excess supply. I don\u2019t know how sustained this Dai supply growth will be. This 22 million excess supply makes for a tricky situation. The difference in rates on Compound with excess supply creates a bit of an economic anomaly. This excess supply is not very effective at shielding DAI from the potential effects of oversupply depressing the price. It is more expensive, so people aren\u2019t going to seek the $21 million if we hit the Debt Ceiling. As the Debt Ceiling increases, there is the potential for economic risk.  Questions to Vishesh 1:07:39  Rich: Governance stress again. We have a Poll Monday, Executive Friday. Both are fairly clean. Regularly each Friday we vote on SF, soon multiple polls get wrapped into a single executive. What happens when we have a series of polls that may create friction or contention with each other? Will this lower engagement? Create weak executives? What if people are drawing DAI because they believe that they can profit off the coming crunch? With a debt ceiling continuously rising, are we feeding this opportunity?  Vishesh: It doesn\u2019t seem that it\u2019s only for refinancing. There may be some degree of hoarding behavior going on. \u201cNefarious\u201d might not be the right word; profit-seeking behavior combined with fear and risk is how I see it. It\u2019s not a coincidence that we saw Sai demand pop overnight. Migration is coming, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s unrelated. However, guessing incentives and reasoning is tricky. The data indicates some hoarding, as the DAI didn\u2019t dump on the market. Those trades (DAI for ETH, etc.) were made quicker in the past. Rich: Interesting, and we\u2019re giving out $20 million more DAI. Vishesh: Again, we need to be considering why we\u2019re increasing the supply cap. This weird thing is happening with the secondary lending rates. You can\u2019t just point to the 22 million on Compound and say that\u2019s a direct accounting for that buffer. It\u2019s not as 1:1 as it was in the past. Rich: It\u2019s certainly interesting! We have an upper bound at how high the ceiling can go. We can\u2019t reinterpret proposals and the wording matters here. E.G., \u201cthe debt ceiling poll expires at MCD launch.\u201d Hopefully, we don\u2019t hit the cap by next Monday, so we don\u2019t need to raise it again.    David Utrobin Forum Activity Recap 52:51  Governance at a Glance Thread  Ask Forgiveness Not Permission: Five Tenets for a Productive DAO  Effective productivity in the DAO. Do things first, then ask forgiveness later. I highly suggest reading this one; it\u2019s a great discussion about proper action.    Inclusion of a DAI Stability Index, to MKR holder risk profile  This thread is about getting more MKR to vote and incentives to keep the peg. Popped up on the call last week thanks to PatrickD for taking on an action item and opening the thread!    Maker Governance Analytics Dashboard  New Governance Dashboard From the Protofire team. Add feedback in the thread; they\u2019re looking to improve this via community input.    [UNI-V1] Uniswap Liquidity Tokens as Collateral  UNI v1 liquidity tokens as collateral thread. Lots to consider here on paper, so let\u2019s talk about those considerations, pros, and cons.    [Proposal] Migration Risk Construct  Cyrus posted the migration risk construct. Not too much discussion there.    General Questions and Discussions 50:10  Rich: Next week, we\u2019ll have another governance meeting and an extra clean up poll. This will position us to have the executive by the 15th, and then we can ratify the risk construct in time.  55:00  New Maker governance dashboard launched, quite a bit to digest there. As we\u2019re blazing new territory here, there is a lot to learn about how votes change, etc. This tool also helps us identify any of those \u201cstress fractures,\u201d I mentioned earlier. Soliciting the community for improvements, join us in the forums to discuss. It also allows us to address engagement going beyond just what, how, and why; the dash lets us start subdividing emergent categories of users looking at them, demographically. We\u2019re going to see parties form \u201chawks, doves\u2026YOLO-ers.\u201d  Nov 5th community call Leonardo, from Protofire, did a walkthrough and demo of the dashboard.  1:15:38  Rich: Lawson had some great questions about more automation in governance and less granular human management. Generally, we talk about magic algorithms when it comes to risk management, but we\u2019ve been having discussions about how we deal with governance itself. David: While we assemble these questions, one more shill for the Community call on Tuesdays. If you are an integrations partner, user, or interested party. We\u2019re dedicating the first 30 minutes for migration questions, Lolike will attend to help answer.<Spelling?>  Aaron goes to David\u2019s house. Hence screencap.   Rich: Dig into the migration plan; the name is a bit of a misnomer. It\u2019s more than a risk construct; it\u2019s precisely what MCD will be. Cyrus: Read the auction guides in the chat too!  ",

Spooky because we\u2019re going to hear from Cyrus again about the migration plan. We\u2019re going to talk about the governance ecosystem at first. We want to hear from everyone here, lots of strong opinions, and deep insight to share. As always, any questions or comments, please type them into the side, or speak up if you have access to a microphone. The Debt ceiling discussion and forum vote, largely shepherded by LongForWisdom, resulted in a Governance Poll. Stating that if the amount of circulating DAI came within 10 Million of the ceiling, then the plan is to add another 10 Million to the Debt ceiling and set the next vote.  This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a Poll that allows for an Executive Vote to be created without moving through a polling stage first. That needs to be internalized. It\u2019s a very cool but potentially risky.   Similarly, we are creating prototypical roles for that are imbued with special authority to do things. Cyrus for the Risk Teams and Nick for the Interim Oracles Team are examples.  The reason we created these roles is to establish a baseline that allows the community to eventually take over. So, in short to mid-term, the community joins us in these positions and helps us craft them. And then, in the long term, replaces us in these positions as the foundation winds down or focuses on different initiatives. Join the discussions in the forums where we hammer out some of the philosophical aspects of what on-chain governance looks like.   As governance becomes more sophisticated, we have a sort of race condition for the improvement of the governance portal. We\u2019re determining the requirements of what we need of the system, and as the system becomes busier and more complex, we\u2019re finding more flaws in the current Governance Portal.  For example, in order to push a poll to the system, there is a significant amount of administration that needs to be done. Content needs to be written, light math needs to be performed, markdown files need to be posted, a poll gets cued up and sits in a tool, and then when a timer goes off that poll shows up on-chain.   We have two mechanisms:  Polls; Which are time-bound. Executives; Which are open-ended.   One problem is that sometimes Executive Proposals will come along that determine the contents of a Poll; For example, last weekend, somebody came in between the time of SF adjustment Poll posting and the ratified SF adjustment Executive Vote, then staked a large amount of MKR. That makes it so this week we have a poll reflecting a range of numbers to an Executive Proposal that was actually stale. That\u2019s why the minimum Stability Fee for this week is 5.5%, as well as the Executive Proposal being 5.5%.  There are some complexities there we need to understand and some solutions we should figure out. Let\u2019s continue that discussion in the forums to find these solutions. My assumption is that it will be technical and social, so let\u2019s find out where those two meet; I think the tools need to be augmented a bit.   There has been some discussion recently about what \u2018plutocracies\u2019 mean. As Maker gets more well known and gains more attention, we keep getting more quick/hot takes relating to plutocracy in our Governance system. One of these is: \u201cwhales are controlling the MakerDAO ecosystem.\u201d So to respond to that, here is what we need to internalize: MakerDAO is a plutocracy.  It was intentionally designed that way by the system architects. We have the MKR token that is used for voting and as the recapitalization source in the event of system deficits. It is the backstop for this ecosystem. We have these stakeholders with the most skin in the game who have the biggest incentive to pay attention to how the system works and to manage it to preserve their holdings effectively. Yet we see some cognitive dissonance where people come into crypto for the first time, see a voting system, and naturally assume it\u2019s representative democracy rather than skin-in-the game voting. MakerDao hasn\u2019t invented anything new, we\u2019ve just assembled some of the best game-theoretic mechanisms for voting and system management and put them on-chain. One of the things we need to do a better job of is explaining to the public that we are managed by our largest holders. It\u2019s our responsibility, the forums and governance community, to lay the groundwork, set the memes, provide direction, and give these larger holders a way to come in and cast votes that benefit everyone involved. Happily, we\u2019ve seen that in all the votes, though I am willing to be corrected if there has been a hostile or antagonistic vote. The primary issue isn\u2019t whales; it\u2019s that we don\u2019t have enough of them. We have whales and then krill; there are mechanisms and tools that the krill can use to self-organize and influence votes. As a voter, if you think that your vote doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t.  The system will be managed by those who take action with the conviction that their votes and influence matter. An example of why every vote matters: We just changed the SF from 9.5 -> 5.5 through a stake of ~1500 MKR.  This is a ridiculously small stake in moving basically the entire DeFi ecosystem and a teaching moment. If you don\u2019t vote, somebody is. The person who does will control the ecosystem. There are many mid-level holders, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot to move the system. So, to sum this up, let\u2019s change this \u2018dirty plutocracy\u2019 narrative to show the benefits of our governance system as designed.     Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Questions and Discussion 14:48  PatrickD: Been listening for a month and spot on Rich, the problem is not a plutocracy, and we saw that one account was able to change so much. Is there a way to hold MKR holders responsible and reward us more for keeping the peg and punish us if we move the value of DAI?  Rich: There probably is. How to properly reward and punish MKR token holders is an ongoing conversation. There are two primary suggestions for that:  An effective system that generates some sort of reward for participating in the ecosystem. My opinion is that no one has figured out how to create a participatory voting system that hasn\u2019t been immediately exploited for gain. How do we reward/punish specific holders for their governance quality. Their is room for that concept, that can be managed, that can be quantified and tracked, the problem with that system is designing it effectively and mitigating the additional friction imposed from eliminating any benefit. Right now, we have an ecosystem driven by MKR holders and the friction we introduced is essentially \u2018click two buttons.\u2019 So for more complex systems like bonding curves, vesting schedules, etc, we haven\u2019t seen any rock-solid proposals that seem effective.      19:03  PatrickD: So we have this 5MM in fees that is there to be burned. If we put that at stake if Dai goes too much above or below one dollar and if it stays at 1, we could put more money in there, these are just examples. I think we should incentivize for keeping the peg, not just if things go to hell.  Rich: Ok, lets\u2019 go to the forums and start a conversation about incentivizing governance. Do we reward risk teams for making a good call? Do we reward the holders? Do we pay someone to vote? A thread would be the beginning of the process of figuring out all the ideas, debates, and thus proposal at the end. Can we count on you Patrick to start the conversation and have a long tail behind it? Then we could get some movement behind better documenting the ideas and why they might or might not work.    21:35  Cyrus: \u201cCan you also talk about why polls can\u2019t be edited after they go live.\u201d  Rich: The Voting mechanism is a contract deployment. The polling mechanism is emitting events on a contract that just show what events have been called in relation to the most recent poll. In order to avoid any foolish behavior, the wording of these polls is on-chain, tied back to a hash that attaches to a vote. If there is something wrong with the poll, then we have to introduce and additional poll immediately. There are no ninja edits where we rewrite history. This keeps the audit path clean.    24:00  LFW: Could there be an option for invalidating a poll? So you could signal that you don\u2019t think the poll is still valid.  Rich: That\u2019s a good idea. Every question introduces more questions. For example: what about day 4 of a 5-day poll and people find that their vote is not valid when they return? Loads more questions there to explore.    Risk Cyrus Migration Risk Construct Review 24:43 Quick highlight: The Foundation put out a blog today that explains the renaming of CDPs to \u2018Maker Vaults.\u2019 TLDR: Better accessibility, and allows us to be more user-friendly as we work on scaling the protocol.  nyXra2l.png1116\u00d7506 117 KB  26:55  One benefit of the migration contract is that it happens outside the public market and exchanges, so users don\u2019t have to incur slippage moving back and forth buying DAI and settling. Eight risks that we\u2019ve highlighted here in the presentation as follows.   h9pzSUs.png1069\u00d7611 82 KB  28:59  Risk 1: Migration occurs too slowly We know that crypto users move slowly(Friction, slow to do things, don\u2019t follow daily news, digging out private keys is difficult.) The plan is to select the most safety conscious risk parameters.   xz3BAFT.png1042\u00d7600 88.4 KB  31:12  Risk 2: Migration occurs too quickly An example is if we start the DSR at 10%, that could be a problem for a number of reasons. There is a level of uncertainty when launching a new protocol. Rectifying any changes that have to be made just becomes more difficult if there is a massive migration going on at the same time. It\u2019s better if SAI holders migrate faster than CDP owners.   ot3USWe.png1023\u00d7597 110 KB  32:59  Risk 3: Secondary lenders might not utilize the migration contract Need to make sure the debt ceiling can sum up both secondary lending platforms outstanding Sai(about 30 Million) because the migration needs to facilitate SAI holders moving positions back to MakerDAO. Without the migration contract, it would entail that these users would need to be buying Sai on the open market. If this happens, market-makers need to be able to facilitate the manual migration of CDPs.   VDFdaBp.png1111\u00d7568 88.5 KB  40:15  Risk 4: Not enough Sai liquidity in the migration contract We want Sai holders to migrate over faster than CDP owners.   VmwG5OQ.png1034\u00d7611 84.2 KB  42:32  Risk 5: No Sai liquidity on public markets Hoarding attacks where a malicious attacker tries to buy up as much as possible and then circumvent everyone trying to sell at a premium for people trying to close their CDP/vault. To deal with that, Maker governance can help market makers by letting them mint SAI cheaply. The only defense of this attack is a Emergency Shutdown, which would be a relative emergency. There is no solution for everyone to migrate if there is SAI that is permanently out of circulation. Ideally, market makers would participate in the assumption that DAI will stabilize back to the peg again.   tXTT1mI.jpg2092\u00d71131 190 KB  48:00  Risk 6: MCD ETH debt ceiling adds risk   fJBSagZ.png1045\u00d7620 89.5 KB  49:17  Risk 7: SAI/DAI price below/above $1   3mY75du.png1033\u00d7626 80.8 KB  51:31  Risk 8: DSR may cause MKR dilution event DSR is recorded as an accounting cost, similar to debt. There is a chance that we trigger a debt auction early on if too much Dai is placed in DSR. Cyrus: An increase of the surplus auction threshold to 50K would probably provide plenty of leeway to stop an early MKR debt auction. David: This only happens if DSR that needs to be paid out is larger than the continuous new fees for new CDP\u2019s   zkZbPyZ.png1096\u00d7625 109 KB  54:49  This is the general plan, same default parameters, 2% DSR, 50 Million Debt Ceiling, gradually reduce SCD Debt Ceiling, maintain a 10-20 Million debt ceiling buffer in SCD for market makers.   yhmURbJ.png1040\u00d7614 102 KB  56:06  Won\u2019t get into this deeply for the sake of time Everything presented here will be in a more detailed document that will be going out in the next couple of days.  Questions and Discussion 35:44  Rich: Can you give us an example of what it would look like for the Debt Ceiling to respond to these pressures?  Cyrus: It\u2019s not preemptively raised, just want to make sure there is always a buffer maintained. If the Sai price were to increase due to secondary lenders closing their outstanding positions, we would need to expand the SAI supply. Cyrus: The overall debt ceiling can be going down, but there should be a buffer present to accommodate for the migration between the current supply and the debt ceiling. An example is that 30 Million outstanding, so 15-20 Million room would be enough. JoeQ: Actively working with secondary lenders to make sure this goes smoothly. Compound, DyDx, etc. David: Also, we don\u2019t need a governance poll for this, we have a ratified Governance Poll we can act on to maintain a 10 Million buffer so we can respond quickly if needed. Rich: Precise wording of that poll \u201conly in effect until MCD launches.\u201d LFW: My bad! Cyrus: As mentioned, yes, we\u2019re talking with secondary lenders to make sure it\u2019s smooth. As time goes on this will get easier over the coming weeks and months. LFW: Instadapp made the Compound bridge, presuming they will do V2 as well? Cyrus: Yes, they just released a blog about that this morning. Assume the Instadapp architecture is slightly different, and it may not be generalizable for all Compound users. But could be wrong there, haven\u2019t had a chance to read the blog this morning.    46:23   David: Does that mean there is a race-condition for CDP owners migrating?  Cyrus: The total amount of loss size is no more than 1%. When it comes to exchange liquidity, Uniswap will always be around and where people will try to find SAI. Technically yes, but in perspective, we want people to migrate as soon as they can, but global settlement is unavoidable. David: so when the very last CDP\u2019s are there, they don\u2019t take haircut b/c they just close the CDP and get their balance of ETH back. Cyrus: Correct.    LFW: Do we want to come out with a process to handle increased cadence of governance calls?  Rich: No way to see what this will look like, so we don\u2019t know how to be agile with which groups. As Cyrus pointed out, we need to figure out a mechanism for that.    1:07:45  LFW: 2 more weeks before MCD, if we vote to reduce the fee again or the SF is at like 2%, then what?  Vishesh: We should continually lower the SF to chase the peg above a dollar. I would discourage continually chasing the .01 % on the peg is not the best plan. The system should weigh those costs when it can bear it, and right now, it can bear it. Cyrus: The overall goal of the migration plan is to minimize the amount of engineering on the community end, so there is less pulling on strings. We\u2019ve designed it for all the stakeholders in the system. So is the question is, what happens if people don\u2019t migrate for an extended period of time. We could increase the SF for one option, but there are more of these options, and it brings up global settlement as a discussion. Rich: Seeing the way the ecosystem moves and responding in kind as a result.

TdJA9kK.png988\u00d7473 107 KB  1:04:32  Utilization rate had a slight uptick, but it\u2019s at an all-time low. Dydx is still in the 70\u2019s range.  Questions to Vishesh 1:04:57  David: Do you think people aren\u2019t refinancing back because there isn\u2019t an easy tool?  Could be a number of reasons. One important thing is the UI and the bridges for refinancing. It\u2019s important to consider the potential that the DAI being borrowed on Compound might be borrowed at either different risk profiles or using different assets as collateral and so the question is how many points in an annual interest rate are borrowers willing to eat in opportunity cost. Versus exchanging assets that they\u2019re using as collateral, unwinding their positions, switching to ETH as collateral, and then refinancing to Maker. In the event that they\u2019re collateralizing with say, USDC, then it may not be worth it to switch around. Traders that are lazy and may be blocked by UI. Another potential case, is if there is an expectation of rates changing, or traders are more comfortable on Compound vs. Maker. We can agree that these behaviors are counter to the economic incentives. Maybe people are higher levered and interested in the lower collateral requirement, so a few interest points per year really don\u2019t make a difference to them. The other side is that they\u2019re using a different collateral asset. In which case closing positions to unwind versus where things stand is not worth the hassle with MCD imminent. Post-call twitter poll on why people aren\u2019t refinancing, 301 votes & many interesting replies    LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 1:12:00  Governance at a Glance Thread  PurityDai  Purity DAI threads are most interesting. Why we can\u2019t leave SCD open indefinitely versus keeping a specific unwinding date. A couple of good points, especially increasing the scope of governance. Cyrus: SCD isn\u2019t as safe as MCD, especially with the new security modules we\u2019re adding. The MKR community could coordinate to prolong GS, but they\u2019d have to be aware of the risk. Rich: Obviously, a camp that would love to see DAI ride the ETH coattails to live and die on that. But I\u2019m convinced that the community will likely initiate GS faster than we think. Mostly because of the tail risks of low liquidity, poorly supported version of DAI hanging around. This is the world we\u2019ll be in for a bit, two ecosystems, how long would we want to shoulder that additional work and confusion? LFW: Yeah, I agree it looks like the majority of the community is there too. Rich: Part of that cognitive dissonance adjustment period. So learning about what we\u2019ve been up to over the past four years doesn\u2019t fit their mental model. New users are acclimating themselves through hot takes, twitter threads, and learning.

Today\u2019s meeting will be a little more free-form. We\u2019ll review the forums with LongForWisdom, migration with Cyrus, State of the pegs with Vishesh, and we\u2019ll discuss various governance-related topics like the DSR spread.  SamM is also here, who has been spearheading the DSR spread debate on the forums. We\u2019ve been discussing open-source governance for a long time, pushing folks into the Maker forums where ultimately our discussions crystallize.   The community has been very active on the forums. The next step is figuring out an efficient end-to-end pipeline for the governance process. We need to do some brainstorming to try and answer some fundamental questions.  How to make sure when sufficient signal is raised and that the signal is heard? Especially with activity and a clear path for what happens afterward. We still need to clearly define, \u201cWhat is consensus?\u201d Especially measuring that in addition to knowing when it\u2019s achieved. Some crypto industry solutions have used \u2018rough\u2019 consensus. Though that is shorthand for a judgment call of an executive or an executive decision based on community/stakeholder exhaustion. I\u2019d like to avoid that as much as possible. LongForWisdom, hopefully, you can expand on the ideas, processes, and efficacy.   One last review of our old process here at MakerDAO:  Debates happen on these calls, in the chat, and on the forum. They become a signal thread on the forums. This thread builds towards a final forum poll. After an appropriate amount of time and consensus, the topic either dies or becomes an on-chain vote. David: Some added context: Ultimately, MKR holders make decisions through their on-chain votes. The forum is where the open-source governance community figures out how to best structure questions, what the options should be, deciding what direction makes the most sense, so the question of consensus on the forums will always seem rough, but the roughness of this process is smoothed out by the on-chain votes of MKR holders. Rich: Right, for Sai, this process was less complex. Once the forums showed up, we had to think about MCD and all the new granular details about what we\u2019re voting on. We have an analog of shareholder voting here where whoever has the most to lose should be the most engaged in the ecosystem\u2019s success. We also have a community of passionate MKR holders who might not necessarily be large MKR holders. This brought up the concept of gathering signal from the community. In the forums, anyone can enter to participate even if they are not MKR holders, which gives rise to some risk. But this is far closer to having a representative democracy in the forums rather than on the on-chain votes themselves. This is an interesting dichotomy since we\u2019ve seen the community doing the heavy lifting. They\u2019ve been coming up with ideas, suggestions, context, process, data collection, framing everything, and facilitating the debate. Then hands off the issue to the MKR holders through the on-chain votes. We\u2019ve seen that the holders are highly aligned with the community. Now there is the question of how to refine this \u201cwe the people\u201d environment in the forums, and how to keep ourselves on-track to making the right decisions. David: That actually brings up an interesting thing that happened this week in the forums. LongForWisdom updated the signaling guidelines thread, one of the first threads on participating in the forums. Hopefully, he can elaborate on what was updated. The sentiment poll about those guidelines was reset, so now people can reaffirm that they understand the signaling guidelines.    LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 12:44   Signaling guidelines  We made a few changes but mostly got rid of old guidelines that didn\u2019t seem to make sense. Removed Point 8, which insisted that polls stay open until the poll moves on-chain. I am no longer convinced this is always wise, and have removed it so that it can be judged on a case-by-case basis. Removed Point 6 \u2018Proposal changes, poll stays the same\u2019 as this was overly restrictive. The format of polls can depend on the issue. Added a new Point 4, highlighting that it is the Original Poster\u2019s responsibility to run the thread through to completion and to at least consider following these guidelines, and the suggested signaling process.    Governance at a Glance Thread  A great snapshot of the weeks\u2019 active forum threads and activity.    Questions about Emergency Shutdown  The idea is that the foundation has a plan in case of ES. The community wants more transparency into that, so no one panics.   Four signaling threads.  Signal Request: Should we replace the weekly DSR Rate governance poll with a DSR Spread governance poll? Signal Request: Parameters for SCD Shutdown - Date vs Supply Signal Request: Parameters for SCD Shutdown - Peg Stability Signal Request: How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes?    Questions and Discussion 13:49  David: I really liked the point of original posters taking responsibility. That one is a call to action that gives the OP a sense of responsibility about the point being brought up. It puts the most passionate person in charge of facilitating the conversation and coming to a good conclusion.  LongForWisdom: Right, though it has trade-offs. Someone could be super passionate about a minor detail that no one else is that interested in. But in general, this is a good guideline. Rich: The thing I wrestle with is: what expectation are we creating for the community members who have an idea that they put into the forum. Is there a clear expectation that people need to campaign for their ideas? Or is there an expectation that some entity or group will see the idea, agree, and then go work on it. David: It\u2019s contextual and depends on the merit of the idea, of course.    16:01  Rich: So to kick this off, how about Sam, you tell us what you think about the process on the forums.  SamM: I\u2019ve done a few posts, and the most recent one about the DSR spread had some good discussion. The idea was to keep the DSR spread close to zero and the Global Stability Fee at roughly the same level as a business-minded decision encouraging the growth of the system. SamM: People asked for a poll, but I missed the signaling thread and didn\u2019t explain the options very well. As a result, I made a more objective thread with more pros and cons and tried to stay neutral. That second one has had more traction. There were valid objections that I hadn\u2019t considered, which threw me off personally. It\u2019s not a clear signal yet; I guess it\u2019s a learning process. I feel like I should make a third attempt, but I don\u2019t want too many signal threads. Rich: We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019ve had issues where the debate is productive but misses edge cases. For example, the Debt Ceiling threads came to consensus on a conditional buffer. Immediately out of the gate, the amount of circulating Dai behaved in ways we hadn\u2019t anticipated. Unfortunately, the vote as it was written couldn\u2019t address the difference in context. This conditional voting also expired once MCD released. It loops back to my original thoughts about maintaining or accelerating this process. David: I think Sam\u2019s experience highlights an interesting characteristic of this process. The point is to move the conversation forward through signaling threads as a tool to sharpen our understanding of the suggestion or issue at hand. Ideally, as threads mature, a TL;DR breakdown by the OP would be good. I spoke with LongForWisdom about including summaries(TL;DR) in the signal guidelines. Sam has already been doing this. Rich: An immediate poll has always felt weird to me. Again, because the debate should take priority first before people express their opinion on a poll. Expecting people to return to the debate consistently and update their vote might not be ideal, and this brings noise to the forum polls that distort the real signal.    22:18  LongForWisdom: The initial poll should be as general as possible. For example, \u201cShould we change from what we have now to something else?\u201d With the aim to get a rough idea about whether there are enough people that care about this to pursue the issue.  SamM: The phrasing there is problematic. Should we change or not seems like it will create issues. LongForWisdom: It\u2019s not about moving to a specific change, just whether community members are interested in one. SamM: Even more generally, you could phrase it, \u201care you open to making a change on this?\u201d LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a fair point. I see what you mean. Rich: Like a straw poll, does the community think it\u2019s worth it to pursue. LongForWisdom: If that initial two week period passes, people bring up suggestions and solutions, then it works well with engagement. If people don\u2019t think about the specifics beforehand, it narrows in focus and makes it hard to engage with. Rich: The other problem is time-sensitive issues. LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t know how you can make it efficient and representative of consensus. Rich: Right, the shorter the time window, the lower the possible engagement.    25:00  Xenofon: A couple of weeks ago we spoke about approved conditional proposals/polls going up instantly and allowing the community to make changes to the conditions afterward to help us make faster decisions, what\u2019s the status of the conversation around this?  David: Like the DC? Rich: I think the fast one included bundled issues, technical and monetary policy-related changes, etc. which we\u2019re still discussing. Xenofon: That\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to. You could use the same tactics for multiple decisions in governance. People with ownership in the project, and of the ideas they want to implement, are the ones who will push and lobby for their ideas to be done. There should be some selected people, dedicated to this community, that should receive the authority to change things during emergencies. Xenofon: I missed some of the earlier conversations. I would love to hear about other proposals, that couldn\u2019t be delegated in this way. Rich: I don\u2019t think we have a specific example right now. We\u2019re discussing the general ideas of consensus and signal, then how to take that to the voting portal and do so in an efficient way. Rich: We\u2019re all here because we\u2019d like to be self-sovereign, but it\u2019s a lot of work. The community is in the same boat. We have identified a risk team, for example, with domain expertise, and they are empowered to make suggestions about what to do. The question is, do we explore additional teams of empowered-actors? For example, signal watchers, who figure out what an idea is, keep people engaged, etc. Basically, a project manager or like an account manager for a new proposal, who shepherds it through the voting community. David: The question is, how formal do you want it to be? So far, we have the Risk Team, Oracle Team, and Interim Governance Facilitator roles mandated and ratified. That\u2019s an example of this sort of actor that is granted special power. But, that is why I liked LongForWisdom\u2019s new guideline of having the original poster bring the discussion through to completion. It opens up a less formal role that creates natural working groups around various topics and issues. Xenofon: I understand that\u2019s quite difficult, especially depending on the proposals. In standard political science, there are proposals that take a supermajority to pass. Perhaps we can look into additional political science insights for decision making as a community. It\u2019s important to define parameters and systems that can be changed by an empowered party, shouldn\u2019t be changed so easily, and ones that should follow a supermajority rule. If there is a way to do A/B testing on some proposals, this could also be valuable. David: Agreed! Defining which issues need what amount of consensus or control over them is a good next step we could take as a community.    30:51  Rich: That brings up another area of exploration around the constant evolution of our processes. We have broad strokes about Continuous Approval Voting and signaling through polls. As we iterate on that over time, we\u2019ve been expecting that our model would need to shift rapidly. There\u2019s no shortage of real-world information about how to govern. Picking and choosing what would be useful from established bodies of knowledge, and bringing those pieces into our world is a fascinating area of research that we should consider.  To formalize the best process for ourselves, we need people in our community to do that. An effort from our community to build this out is important. This ties into finding the engaged actors in our community and finding ways to help them do the work.    33:26  David: Mitote asked about Instant Access Modules; if they\u2019re real. Yes, they are very much real and are coming up soon. Rich: That is definitely something we\u2019ll be discussing and sandboxing soon.  34:32  David: LongForWisdom wants to pivot the conversation towards ES. Rich: That\u2019s an interesting one; it\u2019s a fascinating and important conversation to have. This is about risk more than governance, so I defer to Cyrus.  David: How about a TL;DR on the current thread LongForWisdom: There are questions about the actual process of ES and, more specifically, recovering from ES, some discussion on the forum for transparency from MakerDAO about what that process looks like. To keep everyone from panicking. Rich: Brief context: ES is the ultimate policy tool. The strongest lever to enforce the will of MKR holders. If you want to think philosophically, you could even frame it as the strongest tool for keeping the peg. There are mechanical processes in the code, social processes, how people behave, game-theoretical consideration, what happens after in a post-shutdown world is hard to map perfectly.    37:50  Cmooney: We have a technical awareness about redeploying the protocol. We can redeploy it in any state that the community wants. The big question is evaluating why the ES was triggered. Determining if it was triggered for a good reason or not. There will likely be a split in MKR holders, how to determine who the right actor was, that needs community discussion. I have one idea that might seed solutions: let\u2019s say this was an ESM decision. Clearly, there will be a bunch of MKR sitting on one proposal, and clearly, there was the MKR that was burned in the ESM. Maybe you disregard both of those pools of MKR, and the people leftover would reconstitute the system? But even in stating this proposal, an attacker can have a bunch of MKR on the sidelines. I don\u2019t know, have at it.  LongForWisdom: Is part of the problem that you set an attacker up with a vector to abuse? Cmooney: Yes, that\u2019s a major consideration. David: We can ensure that an MKR holder who is performing an attack through the governance system loses his MKR by introducing a 24-hour lock in the system for any actively voting MKR. This would prevent the attacker from performing a \u201cflash attack\u201d where after passing a malicious proposal, they immediately sell off the MKR they used to vote with. LongForWisdom: Miko outlined it in a thread. If you lock them in along with having a governance delay, then they can\u2019t exit their MKR position. David: Are we seeking comment in that thread about flash attacks? LongForWisdom: Just more foundation interaction. We have good technical roadmaps, but the governance is up in the air. Cyrus: A lot of the operational procedures are still underspecified at this point, it will show up in due time. Making this easy for users is going to be the bulk of the front-end and documentation work. Rich: It\u2019s not satisfying, but now the chance for ES to happen is more realistic. The community will need to use this as motivation. We can\u2019t lose momentum in clarifying the details around ES. Derek: We are working on UI for accessing collateral for ES. It will be a component of the migration app that users can interact with. Nothing to show here yet. In the new year, we\u2019ll have something for the UI(better than the CLI). At a certain point, we\u2019ll present that here.    Risk Cyrus Migration Risk Construct Review 46:53  Before getting into Migration, can we discuss the polls that concluded today?  Rich: The GSM hasn\u2019t passed yet. Cyrus: Can we talk about how the GSM hasn\u2019t passed yet. We got lucky with the monetary policy again; the rates were all voted to remain the same, fairly low. LongForWisdom: I voted to stay the same specifically because we haven\u2019t passed the GSM yet.   Cyrus: Am I right in saying that tomorrow no new Executive Vote will go out? - Rich: Yes.   1069\u00d7693 130 KB   We are at 68.8 million Dai, up 9-10 million from last week. Migration is still underway and progressing at a fairly quick pace.  Over the past few days, the migration contract has been emptying quickly again. We haven\u2019t hit a slow down yet. It looks like we don\u2019t have to consider any additional measures for now, since MKR voters voted to keep things the same. Likewise, the Sai supply has continued to drop.   The Collateralization Ratio is at the lowest point its been all year for SCD, ~250%. Defi Saver protected ~50,000 ETH worth of CDP\u2019s and ~100,000 BAT. Combined ETH locked between both SCD and MCD is also at an all-time high, about 2.3 million ETH. DSR Utilization rate has not changed much, ~25%. Though we\u2019ve heard a few exciting announcements that will affect this rate.  Compound will be integrating un-utilized Dai into the DSR, approximately 13 million additional Dai at the time of writing. Close to allowing borrows against supply Dai, may see more migration from Sai to Dai.  Hypothesis - cSAI suppliers have not migrated because the functionality is not the same; they can borrow against Sai but not against Dai. Any short sellers that use Compound may not have migrated. Hopefully will change soon.   OKex, a large exchange, will be incorporating DSR for their customer\u2019s Dai deposits. Between the two of them, we might see up to a 50% DSR UR. Hopefully, the OKEx integration will inspire other exchanges to do the same.  The system is new, shouldn\u2019t draw conclusions from this DSR UR number just yet. Quick reminder - DSR UR going up based on existing DAI would not affect Dai price (just used for internal accounting).       1284\u00d7701 127 KB   The Dai Debt Ceiling for ETH is nearing its cap. It\u2019s reasonable to bump it up with a similar reduction to the Sai DC.  A $25 million increase and decreases seem reasonable to me.    Questions and Discussion 57:02  LongForWisdom: Should we create a Signal Request thread to change the Debt Ceilings, or should we expect you, the Risk Team, to just go ahead and create the on-chain poll?  Cyrus: I\u2019m not in a position to make that choice. I would be waiting on a stronger community signal on what to do. I won\u2019t just go out and say we should do this ASAP. LongForWisdom: Last time, you created a forum post and a poll on-chain, and everyone just voted on it. My expectation was we would continue doing it that way. Cyrus: The Governance processes and standardization around this is a little out of my domain of knowledge. I am looking to the community and Rich to define better the process, happy to do whatever you decide. LongForWisdom: My personal view is you guys should do whatever you need to do to the Debt Ceiling. Not sure if that\u2019s a common sentiment.    59:01  David: Assuming that the Risk Team takes the lead with a recommendation for a Debt Ceiling change, should they take ownership of the signal request thread? Last time it went directly to an on-chain poll because it was urgent; the Dai Supply was very close to the Debt Ceiling. Right now is a good time to define this process better.  Matthew Rabinowitz: The purpose of a risk team is worth examining. By the very nature of the risk team presenting information, I would assume that it should take signal to the polls. Not go straight to an Executive Vote. The risk team should directly contribute a frame for an issue, in this case, where the Debt Ceiling should go. LongForWisdom: I\u2019d be happy to see an on-chain poll and then an Executive Vote. It comes down to \u201cwhat is a good number?\u201d Cyrus: I think keeping in line with the $25 million is a good amount. Matthew Rabinowitz: I\u2019m talking more generically.  At some point with the next collateral type, and even beyond that. The bigger question of \u201cwhat is the risk team\u2019s role in putting out recommendations.\u201d  For example: let\u2019s say the risk team proposes that supply recommendations about Risk Premiums for collateral XYZ should be 3.5%. A  community consensus is gathered on an on-chain poll and then goes to an aggregate, Executive Vote.   Cyrus: Right, we have quite a few operational models for risk teams. It\u2019s a broader conversation that will happen over the next few weeks and months. The concepts behind new collateral types, Risk Premiums, and Debt Ceilings include a fair amount of complexity and subjectivity. Matthew Rabinowitz: Correct, but I would go even further with Maker\u2019s scientific methodology for the system as a whole. We should have an Executive Vote or Governance Poll to establish that this is a process that everyone wants.  Namely, that: the risk team recommendation goes directly to a Poll, then to a vote.    1:03:30   David: LongForWisdom writes, \u201cI think that\u2019s the general consensus: defer the \u2018make proposal process\u2019 to Cyrus.\u201d   Rich: This comes back to the empowered actors discussion. To empower a group of actors, you need a spark from the community to make that happen. A clear proposal and mandate would help with this issue, even if it is contentious. This discussion needs to be visible on the forums.  LongForWisdom: Do you think it will be contentious? Should we make the risk team do all the decisions about the Debt Ceiling? Rich: This is crypto; everything is contentious. We need to have a clear audit trail that shows that this came from a team with well-intentioned reasons. This decision has long-tail effects. Instead of packages, domains, sandboxes, or Instant Access Modules, we have 5-10 levers/parameters that hopefully a majority of MKR voters all agree on at the end of the week. If that model needs to shift, then there needs to be a clear understanding of what that implies, who is doing it, what that means for the future, how we can reuse that model, etc. Matthew Rabinowitz: Such that, if the risk team makes a recommendation that doesn\u2019t follow the will of the community, we can have a venue to discuss why. Rich: The community\u2019s mechanism for voting should be through disagreement to a plan proposed by an empowered group of actors. This gives the community the opportunity to say no instead of obligating them to say yes. You can distill crypto to the ability to exit or say no to something.    1:07:00  Cyrus: Essentially, we\u2019re hitting the conflict with the project\u2019s philosophical goals and what is possible in practice. It turns out risk requires an enormous amount of work. The original idea was to have multiple risk teams providing recommendations. Until we bootstrap that mini-ecosystem, there will be reluctance from the community since the power feels centralized to one team. It\u2019s a weird situation that\u2019s necessary for the bootstrapping of the system. However, any one risk team giving suggestions puts us at odds regarding governance. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear how that would play out, and I would suggest moving slowly and keeping the discussion going.  1:08:53  David: Robert, from Compound, described in rocketchat how MKR holders will control the interest rate model for MKR on Compound, any thoughts on that?  Cyrus: No idea on that one. Rich: Ultimately, they just apply a modifier; there are no additional mechanisms there. Tim Black: They just don\u2019t want to update the contract every time we change Monetary Policy. IIRC July was volatile with changes, and it rocks the boat to update the contract in the open. People on crypto twitter go bonkers.    ",

Volumes have been up this week, sitting at 3.6 million.   1409\u00d7700 166 KB   Most Sai trading has been happening on Uniswap and Kyber, a tiny fraction Radar Relay Sai has been hovering lower than Dai, but all in all, is holding a relatively healthy peg. All in all, with what we\u2019ve seen in volume from migration, DSR deposits, on the markets, and elsewhere it seems things are proceeding in the way we expected them to.    $18 million in the DSR, up $2 million in the last few days. As far as interest rates holding, the BAT and ETH SF parity has been working without an issue. Holding the parity with a 4% DSR has also been working fine. This relatively low SF of 4% seems to be working fine in regards to the pegs. That\u2019s an entirely different conversation we can have just to examine that observation.  The original thought process was that if the SF is lowered, then the market floods with new Dai supply. Curiously, during the migration, this process has been steady even though the SFs dropped so low. In regards to peg stability, watching the aggregate supply between Sai and Dai is the most important indicator of what might or might not happen with price.     1096\u00d7597 103 KB   Looking at Collateralization Ratios here, I split up the Vaults into different CR% buckets. This is MCD specifically. The majority of the MCD debt has been sitting between 225% and 325% CR, which is relatively low and may be primarily a function of ETH price dropping. It could be a function of risk tolerances or the system being so new. Perhaps people are applying lessons from SCD where they had a bigger collateral buffer. We can only guess what the reasons are. We\u2019ll see what the taste for risk is going to be for Vault owners. SCD was hovering between 300 and 400 for the majority of its life cycle. It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch Vault owners risk tolerance moving forward.   1012\u00d7699 230 KB   The top 100 Vaults constitute $58 of the $68 million Dai. The top 10 account for almost 50% of the MCD supply. Of the Top 15, the average CR is ~250% range. This is a decent amount of risk to be aware of. We\u2019ve looked at these kinds of graphs in the past and have viewed 150-250 as the highest risk bucket. This dovetails into the earlier point I was making of Risk Analysists making recommendations on answers versus doing analysis.  Making these calls about an acceptable level of risk is a business strategy question. Running numbers on \u201cwhat is the state of things\u201d requires a toolset and time to figure it out. The distinction of what are the answers versus what do we do with them is interesting. The general model, in my experience, was you make a general model of the state and then make decisions based on that. Having those in tandem is a good way to generate a strategy.    Secondary Lending Platforms  879\u00d7685 130 KB   On Compound, the DAI borrow rate has not changed much. The SAI borrow rate has come down, along with the overall size of the SAI lending pool. The amount of DAI being supplied on Compound is still holding at the same level. Cyrus touched on Unutilized Dai entering the DSR.  Questions to Vishesh 1:18:04  Guilherme: Are we tracking this dynamically as a time series to understand Vault owner behavior?  Vishesh: In the past, we had. With MCD, we have to rebuild everything. I currently run the static data at this point in time.    1:21:58  Guilherme: I was curious about the role of risk. I have the impression that business folks come with hypotheses and hand it over to the statisticians. So there are models based on those hypotheses. Wondering if that model would work in a decentralized setting. Thoughts from you and Cyrus?  Vishesh: I would just touch on my experience from earlier on in Maker. Rich touched on these, a lot of the push earlier was with the SF and the Dai peg. We needed to focus on a simple answer: what should we do with the SF. To me, that\u2019s not the rigorous way to find a great answer. If you have the same responsibility for determining the question and the answer, then the system lacks balance. I don\u2019t think analysts should go ahead and give the recommendation based on discovering the question at the same time. Rich: Nice recap! This brings us back to the empowered actors model. As always, I encourage everyone to go to the forums to continue the discussion.    1:25:36  Xenofon: Where can we find information about which potential collateral will enter MCD next?  Rich: This is something we\u2019re currently wrestling with. The topic could take up a whole call. There\u2019s lot\u2019s of documentation about the collateral onboarding process.  Currently, someone representing a potential collateral type would post in the forums a completed application, found in the link above. From then on, it would lead to rigorous debate and analysis to rate the asset according to its risk. The short answer is that there is no short-list of what collateral is next to be added into the system. You can view the forums for the assets that have completed applications.

Today I am the only Governance Facilitator for the next week or so, but we\u2019ll discuss that later. We have some themes arising in the ecosystem, more than we can track. One of the themes is cognitive overhead and the number of threads that we need to keep organized in these calls. The theme I want to discuss today is whether algorithms will save us or not and whether humans are a good thing or a bad thing. It\u2019s my contention, and probably all of us in the group that enormously complex systems still require humans. We\u2019re not in this glorious future yet where a python script can replace all of us. Hopefully, that day is coming [laughs], but it\u2019s not here yet. We have to maintain two tracks in this Governance ecosystem. One of them is code, and one of them is a social layer. The social layer is where it gets tricky. There, we have to deal with interesting things like reputation, identity, consensus, and debate. All kinds of endlessly murky and fascinating topics need to be explored to have large groups of individuals align on a mission and execute on that mission.   That\u2019s why we have these calls, their hard benefits; Information sharing, broadcasting general topics, and trends, but there is also a cultural component: a social construct where we all align on our own identity and come to conclusions about our norms and expectations. These things are all very complicated. Though they happen organically, it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be helped along.   That\u2019s my segue into chatting about today\u2019s agenda. The team from Sourcecred is attending today to talk about their project that helps align the complexities of the social layer with incentivizing activities that are good for the protocol. And vice versa creating a symbiotic relationship with the social layer. I\u2019ll leave explaining those mechanisms to them.   Later on in this call, we\u2019ll have a section dedicated to MIPs, which we will increasingly devote more time to. As we create more cultural norms, how we talk, how points of order are addressed, whether I need a powdered wig or not [chuckles].   Wil Barnes is here, and thank you for picking up a critical issue to discuss and drive forward: the GSM delay and the Dark fix. Call it what you will, but the GSM delay is a technical protocol problem that has been solved. To tie this back to my original thread about complexities, there is a social layer here. We need to get into other murky topics like trust, reputation, and identity and how that relates to the dark spell mechanism.   Charles will give us the weekly MIPs update as we dig ever deeper into that world.   Discussions happen in the forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 05:53 Three Bullet Summary   DAI remains above $1, averaging around $1.005 over the last seven days.   There are many MIP 6 collateral applications on the forum. Please consider leaving constructive comments!   DAI supply has increased by ~$10 million in the last week, largely due to ~$4 million minted using wBTC as collateral.   Discussion Threads   Hashing Gov Polls and Process MIPs onchain   Discussion thread: Let\u2019s lower the ETH liquidation penalty to 5% to restore the Peg   Maker SourceCred Trial   Signal Request Threads   Signal Request - Change the Stability Fee Structure   SamM: Results are in, the poll passed. Next week we\u2019re going to start voting on the base rate vote, which means less weekly votes. Splitting the fees into a base rate plus premium set up. So, yay!   LongForWisdom: Great, also a reminder that this was the first test of ranked-choice voting. Does anyone have any comments?   BMM: We need to do that for more things, I can\u2019t wait for the next one.   Rich Brown: There might have been some confusion in the ecosystem about ranked-choice, and it\u2019s default application. It was my understanding that it was a new tool but not a default applied to all votes, and other people had a different understanding. I went back and read through all of the posts and couldn\u2019t find anything about, by default, adding it to monetary policy votes. Certainly on the table though, I\u2019m open to either, and they might be a good fit for the monetary policy votes.

We haven\u2019t built one yet, so we just use discourse\u2019s graphs, [discourse is the platform the for forums].   For SourceCred to work, there needs to be something to flow Cred from. For instance, it can go from likes in a discourse post, and then flow through a graph of contributions.   1437\u00d7804 326 KB  This is something we can do today, with top topics ranked, as well as user scores ranked if they were connected to posts referenced in high-value posts/discussions.  1438\u00d7812 216 KB 1440\u00d7808 222 KB  This is a community-driven algorithm with a lot of sensitivity to parameters. As you can see, we weighted heavily with likes. There\u2019s lots of configuration about minting Cred and how it flows between different actions. E.g., references and posts.  1067\u00d7598 247 KB   A couple of months ago, Seth Benton came on the Forum to post the initial Cred distribution based on the forums. It built into a conversation to talk about compensating everyone participating in Maker Governance. After talking to the Foundation, we came up with his proposed trial of 3 months (June-August). We\u2019ll do weekly payouts of Dai, which will be based on lifetime Cred scores. This algorithm tries to reward underpaid people, with lower Cred being paid first.   We use this algorithm and compensation structure on our platform, paying participants in our native token, called grain, which is redeemable for dollars. We\u2019ve had good results, distributing 400K worth without much gaming of the system or weird behavior.   1440\u00d7812 253 KB  There needs to be buy-in from the community, both with individual conversations for any users, potentially gaming, and weighing various parameters.  1070\u00d7582 263 KB  We\u2019ll post the link to our community call and our discord. Please attend next Tuesday!  Questions and Comments 2 19:31   Rich: There is some cognitive overhead there. This is a tremendously compelling initiative since we have different demographics in this ecosystem. Depending on the level of interaction, classification, and a few other criteria, various levels of reputation and compensation are available to people who engage with our ecosystem. This is very compelling to me; there is an interesting experiment to be had here. We have a skin-in-the-game voting mechanism on the portal, but we\u2019ve seen time and time again that the Plutarchs take direction from this loose representative democracy that we have operating on the forums.   Which creates a bit of a free-rider problem, how do we address this issue with a great deal of highly intelligent and engaged stakeholders doing exciting work on the forums? How do we address the problems of commitment drop off or burn out and make compensation adequate? Or at least understand what adequate compensation looks like. How do we reward people for there efforts? How do we disincentivize bad behaviors? These are all ancient \u201cHard with a capital H\u201d problems in the space and the internet in general. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out now with crypto and engineers at our disposal. The idea is to do something good, push the protocol forward, improve the quality of the conversation, embellish the culture, and add to things instead of moving away from them. The community and the protocol will attempt to reach an altruistic state where people are rewarded for those activities. This is an enormous, complex, and sophisticated thing with far-reaching implications. We have to start somewhere, and Sourcecred is a fresh implementation for us to try. Hit up the trial details and make your voice words.  tl;dr Come and do useful things in the forums, and $5k Dai will be allocated across people who provide value if it turns out to be a smashing success, then presumably, that pot will increase. If there are fascinating game-theoretical exploits we discover, then we can all improve together.      22:53   Cryptowanderer: Thanks so much, fascinating presentation. It would probably be better when exactly when we build the plugin, how to make signal posts, and governance polls not first-class citizens in the Sourcecred protocol later on down the line. But my main question is around these negative feedback loops. If someone is behaving in a way that is contrary to the goals of governance, we should slowly encourage people to shift on or not game the system. This is doable when the community is smaller, but I was wondering if you can somehow assign a negative economic impact on negative behavior? That it isn\u2019t just social or emotional \u201chey, please leave our community alone,\u201d but that there are tools that can be implemented at larger scales to get people to behave or move along?   Dandelion Mane: This is something we talked a lot about a lot. Some platforms, like in GitHub, there are positive(thumbs up) as well as negative(thumbs down) reactions. We\u2019ve thought about whether negative reactions should result in negative Cred. We\u2019ve had success with focusing on the positive side, for the time being, letting negative feedback fall on the social/platform level. If we need to, we could implement a Cred \u201ctime-out\u201d as a moderator tool. Say for the next two weeks; half your Cred would get recycled to other people. This could be a time scope kind of penalty. It\u2019s a pretty flexible system, and there are a few ways to build new behaviors as needed or punish bad behaviors, but we haven\u2019t had to do that.   CW: \u201cNeg-cred\u201d and \u201cnaughty-bucks\u201d are interesting ideas.   RB: It\u2019s one of the interesting things, and I want to see how it develops. Dandelion can attest that I\u2019ve had a bunch of piercing questions. I pelted him with a ton of negative hot takes; they survived and convinced me that it\u2019s a good idea. As a community, do we want to attempt to shape behavior with an algorithm? Or do we simply reward good work with Dai? That\u2019s a broad spectrum. On one end we have a social credit system where if you don\u2019t tow the party line you can\u2019t buy an airplane ticket. On the other end, people feel better with compensated free time. There\u2019s a big spectrum in between. Does the community want to attempt to disincentivize? That\u2019s a big decision. Incentivizing is a feel-good, let\u2019s move this thing forward, feeling. These are some of the interesting philosophical, ethical, social questions that we need to ask ourselves. And the good thing is that the SourceCred system gives us a path to start asking those questions.   LFW: Something I wanted to add to this conversation is that part of the trial details we set it up so that the trial will not proceed unless a forum poll passes with a majority because it is potentially disruptive. So if you do feel strongly about trying SourceCred or against, please feel free to vote in that poll.   Rich Brown: Wonderful caveat to bring to the community as a whole, an escape hatch in the beginning, which is the first for a grant application. Thanks, Dandelion, and co. for that.     28:03  Rich: Time to segue into the MIPS process. I talked about that at the outset, where MIPs is a new paradigm and mental model we\u2019re all growing accustomed to. Still trying to figure out if we separate sections of the call or not. Where we all put on our MIPs hats and behave in a MIPpy manner. Charles, I\u2019m going to hand it to you, and after that, I think I\u2019ll perform my MIP responsibilities for the day, and then we\u2019ll give it to Wil.  MIPS Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 28:59   I\u2019ll try to keep it briefer today as the agenda is quite packed. I\u2019ve shared the MIPs update that I posted in the forums a couple of days ago.   I\u2019d like to go over the current results of the current governance cycle and LongForWisdom\u2019s MIP that\u2019s been going through, as well as a few other MIPs that have been proposed and are in Request for Comments phase. And then introduce Wil, who will talk about the Dark Fix Mechanism MIP.   This week\u2019s main thing was that the governance facilitator facilitated a governance poll for the core personal onboarding of LongForWisdom to be added as a governance facilitator.  This poll passed today at noon EST.    On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll have to go through the review of the results of this poll and then confirm that the outcome of the governance poll is what we kind of think it should be and can then prepare for week four of the governance cycle which introduces the final vote for LongForWisdom\u2019s sub proposal and an executive that will be posted next Monday.   The executive vote will be submitted if the governance facilitator confirms that the yes outcome of the governance poll during week three\u2019s governance meeting. That\u2019s what Rich will be doing as his duties today.   The vote will have an expiration of four days. After that, it will have no effect. In general, MIPs and sub-proposal only move to the executive\u2019s status if the executive vote has passed within that four-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within that four-day limit, the MIPs and sub proposals are changed to the rejected status.     In the forum, I think J. Falman, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m mispronouncing that, asked if this is rejected, can it be reintroduced, or is this LongForWisdom\u2019s only shot at getting elected as a Governance Facilitator?  Right now, we\u2019re following MIP 2. This is a period of time where we\u2019re bootstrapping the setup and implementation of the first governance paradigm. More specifically, this defines two main phases. Right now, we\u2019re in phase 1, when a core governance framework is put in place, and a functional collateral onboarding process is ratified. Phase 1 will last three months after being officially ratified, which was the beginning of this month. To answer that question: MIP2-phase 1 states that if the MIP is rejected, it can indeed be reintroduced to the community for another vote once the issues at hand have been resolved. So it\u2019s not his one shot at getting elected.    In addition to that, LongForWisdom also introduced two other MIPs.   MIP 13, Declaration of Intent   MIP 14, Protocol Dai Transfer.   Both of these MIPs are in the request-for-comments phase, and there have been many ongoing conversations. LongForWisdwom has been trying to push the conversations forward, and I\u2019m trying to get these introduced into the next governance cycle. If you have the time, check those out. There have been many conversations around the Declaration of Intent and how it could relate to bounties if we want to include a bounties platform as a part of the MIP or keep it external. So that\u2019s the update.     In regards to next week, the last week of the governance cycle, the executive vote will be submitted once the governance facilitator confirms the yes outcome of this week\u2019s governance poll.   Next Monday, May 25th, we also have the first community green light polls. The purpose of these polls is to give direction regarding what to do next regarding MIP 6 applications.  In the future, the community green light polls will be published on the 4th Monday of the month and will last until the Friday of that month. And the polls will last for two weeks each. I\u2019ll share more information in the chat about this, but it\u2019s all defined in MIP 9. It\u2019s this process where MKR token holders can signal their judgment on the value of a collateral asset or a collateral type before domain teams can spend time thoroughly investigating and working on those requirements to get them added to the protocol.    Next Thursday, the governance facilitator will perform the governance cycle review as part of the governance and risk meeting. They will summarize and discuss the past governance cycle with the community. You can also have the opportunity to discuss the upcoming governance cycle, what proposals will likely be proposed during that formal submission period and any possible submissions that might want to go in.   In other news, concerning the transition to the collateral onboarding framework, I want to re-emphasize that we\u2019re still in this transition period from the current practices that we know, in the weekly cycle, to the eventual full transition of the MIP\u2019s process and the collateral onboarding framework defined in the MIPs.  Given that the community green light poll results will last two weeks, it will conclude around May 28th, and the MIP 12 proposals that would include the domain work for those collateral assets will not be ready for June\u2019s governance cycle. So the domain teams will determine which assets they intend to work on and signal their intentions. They can also begin working on the deliverables for those collateral types throughout June. And then we\u2019ll proceed through the transition process after that, and we\u2019ll see if it aligns.    Lastly, for collateral onboarding, there was a community call yesterday held by Lucas and Leah, where they continued to discuss the PaperChain Drop application and the ConsolFreight Drop application and other MIP 6 applications. I don\u2019t have the video recording for that, but if someone does, please share it. It\u2019s nice to see these community calls keep happening. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to talk about the community green light on these calls and not take away too much time from the governance calls.   ",

There was one poll in that roll up, and the poll was for the ratification of a second governance facilitator. The poll happily this time around was unanimous, so it\u2019s moving to an executive vote at the end of the month. Beginning on Monday for four days.   I also want to point out that it was unanimous this time so LongForWisdom will not be the most disliked actor in the ecosystem [laughs], so whoever voted 400 MKR last week had a change of heart, which is nice to see. The vote will move to an executive on Monday for final ratification. I believe that is the end of MIPs order, is that correct, Charles?   CSTL: Yes. Perfect.   Rich: Let\u2019s hand it off to Wil, and we can hear about the GSM and the dark fix and some of the tasty social layers of ambiguity that we need to consider.   MIPs Wil Barnes MIP 15 GSM Delay & Dark Spell 37:41 913\u00d7494 153 KB   Thanks, Rich, for the intro and the words of trust in the social layer. We\u2019re six months into this deployment, and we have a GSM delay of 12 hours.   The GSM is the Governance Security Module, which enforces a delay period before a given executive vote is applied to the system.   913\u00d7481 108 KB   The predicament is that if we have an actual critical vulnerability, what do we do? Can we patch the system? The issue is that the spell[governance proposal containing the fix] will sit inside the voting system, and it will be delayed because of the GSM\u2019s delay period, and anyone can attempt to reverse-engineer it, creating economic damage, potentially causing MKR holders to trigger an emergency shutdown.   We want to prevent the use of the emergency shutdown procedure, and we also want to keep the system operating with maximum uptime.   823\u00d7459 68.7 KB   We have been discussing for several months on the forums; there have been great ideas proposed and a lot of input from the community.   We decided to structure it as a MIP   MIP 15 Dark Spell Mechanism is available for review in the forums.   The goal of the MIP is to have an initial policy in place that we can work from and introduce iterative design during future governance cycles after ratification.   We have discussed the process, and we will have to communicate with the community and coordinate a governance vote using this Dark Spell to apply the fix. Having the MIP in place is the first step in the process.   1008\u00d7528 211 KB  The advantage of the Dark Spell over the Emergency Shutdown is that there are several unknowns with Emergency Shutdown. Still, also it will have zero downtime and avoid reputational damage that might be caused by ES.  824\u00d7461 102 KB   I encourage everyone to read this MIP on the forums. As of last night, there are eight sections, very generic. Most people will be familiar with most of the terms. Section 3 is Dark Spell requirements, which are for critical vulnerabilities.   We have decided for section 4, that the Governance vote is a separate referendum, so each vote will be unbundled and voted on individually to fix a critical vulnerability.   Policy 5 is a combination of the previous four sections. You can read more about it offline.   Lastly, sections 6, 7, 8. This introduces the concept of Trusted Parties, someone the community selects and elects. The process is very lightweight and bare-bones right now.   Section 7 is the election process. The parties could be anyone: individual, project, independent auditor, attestation firm, or smart contract security firm.   Section 8 is the removal process.   823\u00d7459 144 KB 823\u00d7458 72.3 KB   So that\u2019s the spell. We need to continue discussing this, and we need to place this in the next governance cycle.   The next steps are to join the discussion on the MIPs channel in RocketChat and the Forums.   Questions and Comments 3 46:35   Rich: There\u2019s some exciting stuff embedded in here, and I want to draw attention to it. The crux of the matter is that we have to deal with trust, which is a very tricky thing to deal with in this ecosystem. Let\u2019s boil it down to the brass tacks. Somebody has discovered there\u2019s something wrong with the protocol that needs to be fixed. To do that, you need to run a tremendous risk: let people in the ecosystem know, inviting the risk of someone performing the exploit. The solution is a dark fix, where the domain team or the Foundation, or even a third party, says, \u201cwe have a fix for the protocol.\u201d We want the community to reply yes or no, vote this thing in. Still, we cannot tell you what it is, because if we do that increases the area of attack for the protocol, which is a conundrum; How does the ecosystem vote for something that they\u2019re not allowed to possess the details of. The solution is to find someone, an organization, or a group of individuals that possess some or all of the information about that exploit and can publicly signal that they know and agree that this is important. The community should vote this thing through.  And therein, that\u2019s where the complexities arise. Who gets trusted in this model? How much information are they provided about this thing that they\u2019re offering opinions about? What level of trust does the community feel comfortable with? Do they need to be bonded? Do we need to know what their address is? Do they need to have a corporation behind them? Is reputation enough? Is this something that the community has to identify a group of empowered actors that assume that responsibility on behalf of the rest of the ecosystem? There\u2019s a lot inside there. I encourage the community to have a look at that MIP and provide some insight because this is a thorny issue that needs resolution.    Risk Cyrus Younessi USDC-B Collateral Proposal 49:38   This morning we put in a proposal for USDC-B, with different risk parameters than the original USDC-A vault type.   There\u2019s been a discussion with the community for a couple of months about having a separate instance of USDC for emergency liquidity, almost as an emergency credit facility. It\u2019s designed for keepers when they\u2019re running low on liquidity in times when there are a lot of auctions going on in a short period of time. This is designed to alleviate this. The stability fee is abnormally high to discourage long-term or sustained usage. Give the thread a read, and let\u2019s chat about it the forums. We can also discuss it on next week\u2019s call.   Analysis Vishesh The State of the Pegs 52:15 893\u00d7460 120 KB  Total Dai supply is up.  1070\u00d7524 45.5 KB  For Dai from ETH, it is has been a linearly continuing trend since the sharp decrease in March. The Dai supply has just been rising. Our latest touchpoint on Dai from ETH is 104 million, which is very solid.  1150\u00d7496 68.5 KB  That was ETH, so for Dai from USDC-A, we saw a considerable jump to about nine million-ish. That came up a bit about 4 million, and then went down back down in the last week. That has kind of stayed stagnant with a couple of small decreases since then.  1058\u00d7493 56.3 KB  Dai from WBTC saw a 4 million net jump yesterday, with 4.4 million Dai minted from WBTC, which is a fairly significant amount, given that the DC for WBTC is currently 10 million, so you have about 40% utilization overnight.  1041\u00d7382 142 KB   The impact this has had on Dai price was mostly what we saw was on the longer-time scale; Dai was at that persistently elevated price. ETH had made a considerable jump down (from May 10th to May 14th) and then was recovering (around May 15th), and then it sort of continued its rise and then slowed its growth in the last couple of days.   We saw with Dai price, after the initial crash post-March madness, was that it touched back down to Peg and then started to come back up. There were some potential concerns about a rise happening again, so I wanted to address that.  What we saw was while ETH was cheap, there was no significant impact on Dai. That sort of communicated a degree of uncertainty as to what will continue to happen with prices. However, the ETH price did recover from that, and then we saw very light trading activity. This makes a lot of sense because you mostly have a lot of traders that feel that they mostly missed the boat and don\u2019t necessarily want to lever up now. So you saw very light trading volumes in that time frame. As ETH started to run up again, we saw a bit of an increase in Dai trading volumes, and we saw Dai price come down. That communicates leverage behavior, which corresponds to the May 18th time frame, there was a slight acceleration in Dai minting. This is indicative of a levering up move, which generally tends to bring the Peg down.    And so, we\u2019re sitting very close to peg in the grand scheme of things. I would say that Peg is in a reasonably safe position. Though it is still persistently above a dollar, it is very close to $1. It had even dipped below $1 for a brief timeframe, even though the volume-weighted-average-price had not indeed come down. If you put things in perspective, depending on your definition of bad, the continually elevated peg price had come down during May. It looked like it was potentially going to go back up, but that was a temporary move that is easily explained by ETH\u2019s whiplash.   Unfortunately, ETH has been jerking around the DAI price, but despite that, Dai does seem to be doing its best to return to Peg.   1047\u00d7458 146 KB  In terms of volumes, we saw that only 28.66M Dai was traded for ETH, which, in the global timescale in the history of Dai is a very solid amount. However, in terms of the last couple of months, it is not that much trading. The lower end of that was actually on Coinbase, and the higher bulk was on dYdX. A bit on Uniswap and Oasis. For a time, when a lot of the crash was happening in March, what we saw was that Oasis reclaimed a portion of the trading volume. Since then, a lot has reverted to dYdX. Most of the Dai<>ETH trading happens on dYdX, and a reasonably decent amount happens on Coinbase, which is on the lower end of the price range.  1043\u00d7492 79.9 KB  As far as collateral is concerned, for the WBTC collateral pool, it\u2019s kind of all or nothing right now in terms of liquidations.  945\u00d7472 164 KB  In terms of liquidations, the amount of WBTC locked is about 1.1 thousand WBTC locked in collateral. Proportionately, that is pretty well protected in terms of the amount of collateral and Dai value.  1064\u00d7515 113 KB   Comparatively, that is a 200%-250% collateral ratio and a considerable clustering there. That is a pretty decent buffer in terms of the risk of insolvency. The purple chart is, kind of, an all or nothing liquidation price wall, where at $6000, you would see a tremendous amount of liquidations.   It\u2019s pretty safe in terms of collateral values, but there are different risks with a wrapped asset like WBTC to consider. Likely, BTC isn\u2019t going to make substantial percentage moves, but if something does happen with the WBTC peg, given that the oracle for WBTC is operating off of a BTC price, it wouldn\u2019t be that price movement risk that would be the big thing here. It would be something more fundamentally technological or liquidity related in terms of \u201cwhat is the risk?\u201d This is why we look at these collateralization ratios as we determine what the risk is. Traditionally, for an asset like ETH, the risk is primarily a market risk, but as we diversify to other kinds of assets, we are also expanding the types of risks that we are exposed to.   The ETH collateral pool is pretty well collateralized compared to usual. There is a much smaller bucket in the 150-200% ratio, a pretty decent amount in the 200-250%, but also much more significant than normal 500%+ and 300-350%. That ETH collateral pool is kind of striated, with multiple gradual price walls. In the past, we\u2019ve seen each of these individual walls much larger. It\u2019s kind of smoothed out this collateral ratio profile since March, which I think is a better structure economically for the collateral pool because gradual liquidation helps the system maintain its health. In contrast, large walls of liquidations are a significant risk.   1068\u00d7519 129 KB   Speaking of giant walls of liquidation, for USDC, this is a pretty stagnant collateral pool. We saw that the Dai supply minted from it is also pretty stagnant, with a slight decrease. This is a binary risk scenario; if something goes terribly wrong with USDC as a redemption system, you will have the potential to see 7-10 million in liquidation overnight. Again, most people consider that to be a very extreme risk.   The primary takeaway in terms of collateral is that there has been a diversification of types of risks that the system has been exposed to. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily decrease the total number of risk that the system is exposed to   1049\u00d7506 116 KB 856\u00d7431 176 KB  BAT is sitting at a pretty high collateral ratio overall and a pretty small supply overall. Total Dai from BAT is less than 600,000, which is kind of steady-state for that.

I want to encourage everyone to try to run an auction keeper. As we go on and the Dai supply keeps increasing, it\u2019s nice to have other people running auction keepers to help out when large liquidation events do occur. If anyone needs any help running an auction keeper, please reach out to me at [email\u00a0protected]   1:06:25  Cyrus: I just want to remind everyone that next week TUSD will be going up to a governance poll. TUSD and USDC-B will both have governance polls going on next week. That will be set up for next Friday\u2019s executive vote. If anyone has any questions about TUDC or USDCB, feel free to post on chat or ask directly.  1:07:09   Lev: Has there been a discussion about consolidating the debt ceiling for USDC and TUSD if added.   CY: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had that discussion, but at the very least, my idea was going to be to bring it up next week or the week after, once it\u2019s confirmed that these have been added in.   LFW: It\u2019s been mentioned in a couple of threads but no conclusions yet.   CY: Exactly.   Lev: I think it\u2019s worth thinking about because I can imagine that most people\u2019s concerns about TUSD are similar to concerns about USDC, especially considering how much of the collateral pool we want to sit with custodial, IOU, USD stablecoins. I think that if there was like a clear path by which the total DC combined is as opposed to letting them creep in and increase the total DC for each collateral type every time. I think that would be quite reassuring.   CY: Is this question really limited to stablecoins? We\u2019ll have to discuss this for any off-chain asset that comes down the pipeline. Do you have any thoughts or ideas on the broader strategy of off-chain assets and managing those counterparty risks?   Lev: I agree with you, but I think to most people TUSD and USDC are kind of the same thing. Your idea about the DC probably applies to both, so perhaps we could consider a DC in common. They are both IOU based, US company issued, USD backed, very similar. When discussing TUSD, it may make sense to have a poll for the total DC for (all stablecoins within this jurisdiction). It may be easier to consider instead of raising the DC every time. It would be much easier to keep adding them while splitting up the fixed allowance for these kinds of stablecoin to distribute the risk better. I\u2019m sure people will start complaining that we are sneaking in these USD collaterals, and each time increasing the DC, it does seem that way. While really, what we\u2019re trying to do is split up this fixed allowance that we have toward these collateral types toward more legitimate options to diversify this counterparty risk.   Cy: Makes sense to me.   Lev: I think it would be a shame if these collateral types are dismissed simply because people don\u2019t want to grow the DC to those kinds of assets beyond 20 Million as opposed to being stopped because they don\u2019t like something about TUSD in particular. We mustn\u2019t end up talking past each other.   Mike Dunworth [From Wyre]: In terms of the consistency from the fiat side of things, I think it makes total sense in terms of mitigating the risk and stuff. Having an unambiguous definition of the risk per se. Taking USDC and TUSD, they look the same but are kind of different. The banking partner that TUSD works with vs. USDC, the custody solution that USDC operates under (like the security model on their end). And then you have things like, is everyone using Silvergate bank or is one using Signet? USDC is specifically in treasury bills. Even if they aren\u2019t in a money market account, TUSD might be sitting in a money market. Licensed custodian, registered money services business, stuff like that. I think those are probably pretty sizeable considerations. I would put TUSD as the outlier as most risk and least reward, out of PAX, Huobi, GUSD, etc.   RB: It raises a pretty interesting point about how far down the rabbit hole are we able to go when assessing risks for the stablecoins. Does the level of audits for each one of these collateral types involve us having a clear understanding of their banking relationships and regulatory risks? Cyrus, is this something your team is considering? Or is there just as tranche when considering these stablecoins. Simply, this is the DC, and this is the level of risk for the buckets of stablecoins.   CY: You\u2019re correct in saying it\u2019s undoubtedly a significant commitment to analyze all of the banking relationships and getting that deep insight from under the hood for each of these. If you, or anyone else, has some profound idea about the counterparty risk under the hood, we would love to hear your thoughts about how that might affect the risk parameters currently in play.   MD: I agree about everything. If there is anything I could share regarding what could potentially go wrong. Black Swan stuff is unlikely, but I think it would be good to share because all of this stuff doesn\u2019t come unless you are in the weeds and banging your head against the wall every day, which; is where I am right now. The biggest thing is being backed by treasury bills vs. having money in an overnight money market account. That\u2019s sort of a big difference. I put a lot of thought into it personally because this will be the bridge between CeFi and DeFi. The reason you want to get it right with the stablecoin stuff; we talked about the percentage of the risk out of the whole piece that is willing to be backed by real-world assets, especially these fiat tokens. They will be what the DSR is for centralized assets. In an ideal world, if you are holding a lot of these, you are holding a lot of these assets and representing them as one token. Now, MKR can be earning on the CeFi space as well as opportunities in the Defi space. I think I just took this a bit out of the conversation, but I believe there is a lot of opportunity in this stuff.   lev: I think this is precisely the kind of argument relevant to the specific TUSD part of the process, while someone\u2019s objections about the total debt ceiling in USD stablecoins should be moved somewhere else. It would be useful to separate this stuff.     01:16:57   Lev: As another question, is it public knowledge which money market funds TUSD holds their cash in?   MD: I don\u2019t work at TUSD, and I don\u2019t know specifically, but if I did, it wouldn\u2019t be my place to stay. I know that\u2019s what everyone does. Specifically, they have a risk team as well, and on the backside of their operations, everyone has a different composition. Some have it on the back of Silvergate, earning five bips a year. Others have it more creatively allocated. The answer is: I don\u2019t know, sorry.   lev: I think we should know that kind of thing as part of our decision-making process. The fact that that didn\u2019t come up and that we weren\u2019t able to determine is not ideal.   MD: They are a great team, by the way, in case I sounded unsupportive. I just wanted to help share some thoughts.     1:18:23   cmooney: I wanted to bring up another consideration. In terms of the mental model for thinking about the DC, do we want that to apply to the emergency liquidity facility for USDC-B? There are certain amounts of risk there; that facility is likely not to have many assets under custody most of the time. Also, that facility is likely to be be used and have its DC adjusted in a liquidity crunch or black swan event. Other than that, we should consider if we should turn liquidations on. Liquidations aren\u2019t turned on for this class of custody assets, and that breaks some SF incentivization. I think its a discussion that we need to have.  lev: That reminds me of an important point regarding this USDC-B style of emergency collateral for Dai liquidity injections. It\u2019s even more important to diversify that one across issuers potentially. As an interesting example, specifically in USDC on Black Thursday, before it was a collateral type, it was impossible to get USDC out of Coinbase for a couple of hours because of gas price limitations. They ended up resolving this by adjusting gas prices. But under a similar circumstance, this USDC-B thing would have failed since there would be no way to withdraw it from the main exchange, even if you could scrape together the necessary collateral from the Dexes. In this kind of situation, going to TUSD instead or another stablecoin, you could have withdrawn it as emergency liquidity. This is not something that we should overlook.    cmooney: Any thoughts on liquidations for these, from anyone?  brainmcmichael: I\u2019m going to come out and say that I am in favor of liquidations. It\u2019s a fundamental part of the social contract. If you become undercollateralized due to fees, then you get liquidated. Part of the overall theme maybe not to do it to start, but I want to come out on the other side of that.    1:22:21   Sidebar question, [read by LFW, from monetsupply]: \u201cPerhaps a different initial margin vs. the maintenance margin? So I guess an initiation ratio and then a liquidation ratio afterward?\u201d   cmooney: If it\u2019s for one collateral type, there is no ability to do that as far as I understand.   LFW: If you had 150% at the opening and then a liquidation at 125%, you would be able to open up at 150 and get liquidated under 125%   lev: The only thing you can do is encourage front ends to discourage users from starting with a collateral ratio like that.     1:23:57   Kurt: Something that has to be addressed is if you let these stablecoin-denominated vaults to continue to accrue fees, the system can become underwater completely. And now, \u201csome percentage of Dai are not backed\u201d would be the way to say it. You can\u2019t allow that happen from a protocol risk perspective. We have to figure out a policy for when and how to enable liquidations eventually\u2026no matter what.   LFW: In terms of oracles, we didn\u2019t launch because the oracle was fixed to $1. What do we need to turn on liquidations? Do we need oracles for Dai to USDC price?   brainmccmichael: I think we can do it right now. The big issue is that a lot of the USDC-A holders have let their holdings go below 125%. If we do flip that switch, there will be a whole wall of liquidations. A lot of USDC would be auctioned off, and that would hurt some feelings. It\u2019s not what we want for the protocol.   brainmccmichael: One thing we can do is drop the CR requirements at the same time as turning on liquidations. That would prevent that wall. We would have to make it clear that we are doing this, and that they need to pay some of their vault at least, so they are not within the liquidation ratio.   Kurt: The biggest concern that I\u2019ve heard about liquidating these things is that liquidations would be highly correlated as all of these stablecoins vaults are used to do the same sort of things with the same kind of time frame, making the same sort trades with shorting Dai or generating emergency liquidity. If they all hit liquidation around the same, you can have a considerable amount of debt going to auction at the same time, which can cause its own crisis. You may not fully recapitalize the way you should. Then you have the thing meant to solve the liquidity crunch, now creating a liquidity crunch. With the particular consideration that we had liquidations off, people took positions based on liquidations being off, and now we have to ask how should we unwind that?     bmcmichael: Dai has dropped below a dollar at some points this week. People with USDC positions have probably set limit orders somewhere in Oasis to pick up those large sales and clear out. That may be a reason why we don\u2019t see Dai drop below a dollar for any significant amount of time. And we can\u2019t enforce that either. There is no closed end on any of these.   Outro Rich Brown 1:28:21  I think I\u2019m going to jump into the awkward silence. We\u2019re 1h30 in, so I\u2019m going to stop the recording unless someone in the side chat wants to talk about something. We must get the people on the mic into the historical record for the Youtube views, which are a considerable number these days. Thanks, everybody for joining us and see you next week.

System architects, Wouter and Mariano, are here to give us insights into recent events and the steps going forward. Risk teams will be here to review parameters in the brave new world we\u2019ve entered. Also, Vishesh is going to discuss the \u201cState of the Pegs.\u201d MCD has launched, and now we have two universes to manage. When new launches come in, it\u2019s vital to avoid coordination errors. Specifically, grandfathering old processes into the new world.  In SCD we had the Stability Fee as our primary lever and came to understand its effects. Now that MCD is live, we have the DSR, DAI and SAI pegs, Debt Ceiling management, incentivizing the migration process, and a lot more in the scope of governance.   We have the stage set for a new level of complexity. People need the time and opportunity to adjust and learn how to manage the protocol. I am concerned that our cadence for governance actions has no basis in data. I\u2019ll open a new initiative thinking about our previous structure (weekly cadence, incremental rate stepping, a poll Monday, a vote Friday) and how it can improve moving forward.  We\u2019ll have to be prudent with how we approach the new process. I\u2019ll put up a post on the forums to evaluate our past performance, aggregate the ideas we\u2019ve heard so far. Potentially this can involve a working group with the community, foundation employees, and other stakeholders.   This week, 950MKR effectively set the upcoming Executive Proposal we are voting on this Friday. This is ultimately fine as the real changes happen in the Executive Votes, but it brings up the potential problems we will face in the future.  The problem is primarily around MKR being ineffectively used to safeguard the system. For example, if we have a few weak Executive Votes, then it might spread MKR apart on many unpassed proposals, enough that one person with 20k MKR might be able to influence the system very easily with a new proposal.   Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   MCD Next Steps Wouter 12:10 MKR Authority Transfer  Mqg2HRp.png1288\u00d7730 48.2 KB   These next steps that need to be done will finalize the setup that we currently have with MCD. We discussed the authority transfer on the community call this week too. This will be done in two parts that we will get into shortly. Clarifying: the Flopper is the Debt Auction.   hoBMzfe.jpg1378\u00d7783 246 KB   MKR authority is currently a multisig of the Maker foundation. This authority worked for Single-Collateral Dai, since it used PETH instead of MKR. But now MKR minting through the Debt Auction needs to be enabled for the system to work properly. Part 2 of this will be about actually deauthorizing the Foundation multisig completely from the MKR token contract. This is the big leap towards more decentralization. This will be discussed more next week.   cavuDwt.png1275\u00d7674 229 KB   7GC2e6G.png1280\u00d7653 181 KB   YKfhLWh.png1209\u00d7625 151 KB   We\u2019ll be putting both of these into the forums and sharing the code too. The Executive Vote only needs these: the flopper patch and the MKR oracle update. We\u2019re not changing anything, just giving authority to the system to do something.  Questions and Discussion 26:46  Matthew R: Is there an \u201cundo\u201d capability? Allowing for the authority to be transferred back to the Foundation\u2019s multisig?  Wouter: The authority function allows the multisig address to call private functions. That authority then transfers to the system. The DS-Chief architecture enables you to call any function in the system. E.G., you could transfer MKR to another party. That change would also require an Executive Vote.    27:45  Matt Lucas: Curious why we didn\u2019t catch the Flopper bug earlier?  Mariano: Formal verification is only as good as the specs we write. This patch is for a weird edge case. It wasn\u2019t found with formal verification, but rather with good old manual testing. We caught it via Kovan testnet, and, despite its size, we still caught it. Mariano: Runtime verification is helping us model the whole system. This modeling allows us to simulate running Maker over hours or months. Which helps find more bugs and test updates. Also, we\u2019ll publish a post mortem of this particular bug.    30:55  Mitote: Do we still need an OSM for MCD?  Nik: OSM is there to stop an Oracle attack. It has a delay by design, as a protective mechanism. In SCD, moving the OSM doesn\u2019t increase the attack surface, since affecting the MKR price isn\u2019t as effective as moving the ETH price. In MCD this is different since fees are paid in DAI and not MKR; MCD doesn\u2019t use an MKR Oracle. Although MKR no longer needs an Oracle, Collateral assets still do and benefit from the delay that the OSM provides.    33:11  Jernej: Is there any plan to have issues and bugs be transparent?  Wouter: We\u2019re a little different than traditional software development. We can only add or replace modules and set system parameters. We\u2019re thinking of a Maker Improvement Proposal(MIP) process with a formal flow. Much like EIPs on ETH. Issues have numbers, are recorded, tied to the forum, ushered into the implementation phase, then pushed to an Executive Vote. If we need a patch, then we\u2019d use the same system, but the process will differ. That formal process is another element ushering MCD to a more decentralized and transparent future.    Risk Cyrus Governance Over the Coming Weeks 36:37  SAgRXUG.png907\u00d7487 41.9 KB   DAI Savings Rate is being utilized a little less than expected; what\u2019s most exciting is that the SAI and DAI prices have been stable. Hovering at a dollar for both.   GeiMgZe.png880\u00d7388 47 KB   As you can see, there is a significant increase in complexity for governance because of a number of new parameters. Let\u2019s keep discussions in Rocketchat and the forums going. The following are options for how we can move forward. See this forum thread for the continued discussion. We have a process for gathering input from the community about how to structure and do Governance Polls. These are a few options we could use moving forward. We\u2019ll separate out Debt Ceilings for now since they don\u2019t need to be changed weekly. We experimented with a conditional rule which we may use in the future if the community decides.   YdNwsnP.png881\u00d7429 37.7 KB   This option allows for polling on each of these four main parameters. The result would be bundled into a single Executive Vote.   wUMvo07.png873\u00d7382 28.8 KB   This allows us to only have 3 Polls by keeping the SFs on ETH and BAT the same on MCD. Making them different at this stage provides very small marginal benefit when it comes to risk, given the small amount of Dai generated from BAT.   Bf1PUKf.png862\u00d7335 42.6 KB   An even more condensed option: We can vote on a single SF package which would determine the SFs across both SCD and MCD. The underlying rule would be the keep the rate differential of 1% constant.   VYmDLga.png865\u00d7309 30.3 KB   In the future, we could do a single Poll for a \u201cMonetary Policy Package.\u201d If we can set the Risk Premiums separately and assume they remain constant, then the spread between the SF and the DSR would remain constant as well. We would just be changing the overall level of rates across the system.   Op5pqbk.png865\u00d7335 42.6 KB   Since migration is moving slowly, we don\u2019t have to focus on this for the next poll. We could put out a poll to start lowering the SCD Debt Ceiling.   PEsNzf8.png923\u00d7281 51.4 KB   Eji4Cke.png868\u00d7435 63.1 KB   We need to be more proactive since we have important new tools to help us achieve our goals. Let\u2019s add clarity to our goals and intentions.   PaVZXMr.png873\u00d7424 67.1 KB   We should start to define some of our goals for migration and post-migration. These are my opinions, but we should be incentivizing people to switch over reasonably. It is giving data scientists and our organization enough time to upgrade metrics infrastructure. We should wait for exchanges and secondaries to migrate over and see how that affects the market. These are in a similar spirit to before: be conservative and move slowly.   CwHxxYU.png997\u00d7415 40.3 KB   In contrast, in the future, our goals may be more growth-oriented.   Q1Z5ugv.png982\u00d7507 72.7 KB   Next week we can review the rationale behind risk premiums, DSR, and the SF; more importantly, how to set those parameters properly.  Questions and Discussion 41:03  Rich: Are we combining the SF for ETH and BAT because they\u2019re highly correlated or because of BAT\u2019s volume? Cyrus: Mainly based on DAI generated from BAT is negligible. The Debt Ceiling is the primary risk control over BAT, and it\u2019s set very low.  50:59  Rich: Loops back to the earlier points at the top of the call: With a new system, and with Cyrus\u2019 options, we can look at the medium and short term work ahead. How do we poll for a new system? What does empirical data look like for informed decisions? How can we bundle operational overhead? How do we manage without creating weak executives? I\u2019ll post in the forums. Cyrus: How to structure the polls through consensus? Will the first poll be on Monday? Rich: I assume that we\u2019ll continue with the same process: Collate ideas in one forum post, set a Poll, and then move on from there. If everyone rapidly aligns, then we push the results forward.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 54:56  Surprisingly, not much activity on MCD in the forums. Cyrus came in to talk about migration and system parameters.   Debt Ceiling mechanics suggesting an improvement where individual DC\u2019s relate to the market caps of their assets.  Will Maker abide by AML and KYC laws from FINCEN guidance. LongForWisdom updated the index, making it a little easier to find your way around the forums. Governance at a Glance Thread  Sai and Dai Analysis Vishesh 56:57 Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  RA2b0P4.png921\u00d7592 88.9 KB   For Sai, over the last 24 hours, the peg was stable, a few moments above and below a dollar. I added a graph for the new DAI token as well.   Hs9LjTk.png1278\u00d7527 135 KB   24 hour SAI chart quite stable   Oe581xO.png1260\u00d7502 131 KB   DAI volume picked up in the past 24 hours.   X63d66O.png1290\u00d7654 119 KB   DAI peg showing a window that includes larger trades below a dollar. That\u2019s another tangent we could address.   cLj9CRo.png1313\u00d7620 213 KB   Slight nuance with timing methodology on some of these trades. Additionally, the granularity in pricing relies on Coinbase and other exchanges, which can account for some differences.   NVs69XJ.png850\u00d7576 60.2 KB   This is the Dai peg. Some bumpiness from the switchover.   7AasAlV.png1269\u00d7532 102 KB   DAI VWAP, slightly below a dollar. Trading volume has picked up in the last few hours. Much more than 48 hours ago.    The run-up in supply, leading to migration that indicates supporting behavior. Just after the switch, we saw a $3-4MM wiped, $2MM wiped, $2MM generated, and then finally $3MM getting wiped again. After migration, Sai supply went from $102MM to $96MM.   EuvdOUS.png1268\u00d7540 90.5 KB   In the last few hours, SAI dropped further to 92MM.   WTBRYjt.png1284\u00d7624 76.2 KB   Net $1.8MM wiped. Coincided with a drop in ETH price, to just below $160, which lead to liquidations and more complexity. It will be interesting to see how liquidations impact Dai vs. Sai in the migration time frame.   emPnYle.png1245\u00d7549 109 KB   12.8 million Dai Supply, with 760k in the DSR. Curious to see how attractive this rate is in the market. Maybe a higher rate will speed up migrations.   GC7GVRH.png1139\u00d7615 102 KB   We\u2019ve seen 150K Dai transaction volume in the last three days (via Etherscan). We can reflect on the transaction volume between Sai and Dai in the future when there is better data infrastructure.  Secondary Lending Platforms  tsXovRF.png1271\u00d7599 194 KB   The Compound Sai supply rate is higher than the SF still for SCD. This might slow migration since the rate that you get for supplying assets to Compound is higher than the cost of having that Sai. Theoretically, it\u2019s still more attractive than the DSR at 2%.   czRxVy6.png1072\u00d7600 102 KB   Before migration started, we saw Compound borrow volumes for Sai drop, and they\u2019ve stayed flat.   WKvnEk5.png1251\u00d7648 143 KB   Sai Supply volumes have also held flat. You\u2019d expect more of a dip in both borrow and supply post-migration. Since it\u2019s staying sticky, maybe this lack of motion contributes to the slow migration.   89FntT7.png1086\u00d7618 116 KB   Compound utilization came up a little bit, but net change is about the same before migration began.  Questions to Vishesh 1:06:45  Matthew: Compound migration is when?  Cyrus: It\u2019s in the rocket chat. Robert came and shared that it\u2019s coming. Link to their blog     Further Discussion and Questions 1:07:00  Cyrus: Right now, the SAI and DAI prices are stable, technically everything is fine, and migration is progressing. Eventually, that will slow down, and the natural response is to raise the DSR, incentivizing SAI holders to migrate.  This might make the DAI price more than a dollar. Offsetting this effect of the DSR requires expanding supply by lowering the Stability Fees. The SF being lower would converge the spread between DSR and the SF. This process basically amounts to a subsidy. Since the system earns less in SFs and pays more in the DSR. We need to be aware of these complex dynamics. Does anyone want to contribute to this topic?   LongForWisdom: Is it only \u201csubsidizing\u201d if it\u2019s 100% usage of the DSR?  Cyrus: If the system is earning less than it should, that\u2019s subsidization. We should be earning the real spread between SFs and DSR adjusted for Utilization Rate(UR). If we were to change DSR this week, it would be accompanied by some other offsetting change\u2026 Tying this into the poll structure, It makes sense to combine specific changes as proposed packages. The UR is also tricky. If you change DSR, then the UR goes up, and we have no idea how to think about this.    01:12:13  LongForWisdom: Those patches that Wouter and Mariano presented will need to go into an Executive Vote?  Nik: Everything but the MKR authority part. LongForWisdom: Bundling technical and rate changes seem like a problem. If the rate changes pass with 970MKR, then how many significant changes will happen with less engagement? Rich: In the singular world, this was easier. We can view our governance with two perspectives. One being Economic, the second being technological. Conceptualizing the protocol as an app. In the app model, we can\u2019t vote on every update or emergency deploy. Mixing and matching in one weekly vote might be problematic.   LongForWisdom: Clarifying, so for technical fixes and upgrades to occur, we need to vote?  Rich: Correct. Some of these you need to vote-in, while others like the MKR authority, can be done without voting since it\u2019s something external to the system.   LongForWisdom: Can we not bundle monetary policy changes with technical changes?  Rich: We could say that, but I\u2019m not sure we have the authority or capacity to say that yet.   Nik: We\u2019ve mentioned before how we want Polls to be the decision-making venue while having the Executives be a roll-out of changes.  Rich: The problem is that we say a Poll is a signal, now we\u2019re saying it\u2019s a decision? At the end of the week, we still have a yes or no in the form of an Executive vote. Nik: We can transition away from Poll being a signal, to a Poll being the vote. LongForWisdom: You can\u2019t separate them, it has to be two votes, and you need the Polls. Say one wins 100%, and the other gets less. If the losing side doesn\u2019t want it, they\u2019ll continue to vote that way on the executive too. Rich: I agree, and it increases operational overhead. 950MKR altered the SF because of another Poll and vote that was distracting. What happens when we have 3-4 votes a week? Nik: Maybe the problem is narrative? When you say the polling is just signal, people don\u2019t care enough because they don\u2019t think the stakes are high. Cyrus: They shouldn\u2019t be high because if we have too many Executives, then MKR gets split, decreasing security. Nik: We\u2019re talking about reducing executives correct? Cyrus: Ah, yes, you\u2019re right. LongForWisdom: Polls don\u2019t have stakes, the Executive ultimately controls the system. They can register disapproval at that stage. Cyrus: Technical Executives should be few and far between. It shouldn\u2019t bundle. E.G., including something technical or something you don\u2019t want. Otherwise, bugs would persist. LongForWisdom: That was the point I was making. Cyrus: Maybe we can focus on bundling without technical changes included.   Rich: Let\u2019s formalize this thing, address these situations, record the solutions in the forums, and implement them if the community is in agreement. Generally speaking, we need to make some iterations and improve the system, especially our tooling and conceptual frameworks. Cyrus: Can we delay the Executive Vote? Rich: Perhaps, but I\u2019d like to see the community communicate its signal.  1:24:24  Aaron Bartsch: \u201cWhy not create a mandate/precedent for this type of situation before they happen?\u201d  Cyrus: We\u2019d love too. But, we keep coming up on new edge cases. Rich: Correct, the branching complexity is significant. Especially the time to handle technical issues and discovery as it comes. The community could come together and start thinking of the edge cases in advance. I know the forums aren\u2019t satisfying or sophisticated for handling these. As we grow, we will have to operate in a more organized manner. Ultimately we are managing a software platform, and there are tools and methods in place for managing software effectively.    1:27:40  Cyrus: Does anyone have strong opinions about DSR? Stay the same? Go up or down?  LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t think we can raise it high enough? Rich: We just launched two days ago; there isn\u2019t enough empirical evidence to make changes. Matthew: DSR is a monetary policy tool; the question is the peg. I don\u2019t see it off right now. David: There is a camp thinking about raising the DSR to increase migration speed. Vishesh: I don\u2019t believe the DSR is going to affect the monetary policy given the small MCD supply. It\u2019s more about does it speed it up migration? It\u2019s likely too early to say. Rich: Well, it\u2019s not a long term strategy.   Cyrus: So, what if the community chose to raise the DSR in a more extended timeframe? Could you quantify the cost of a slower migration? Calculating this might help us think whether it\u2019s worth it to increase the DSR. It\u2019s that subsidy I mentioned earlier.  Vishesh: If the DSR is not going to be permanently higher that nobody will take advantage of it. E.G., Sai suppliers on Compound right now are looking to get the best rate. Inevitably as migration proceeds, borrow volumes will decrease, furthering the migration. It\u2019s more of a sequencing question. It\u2019s not about a permanent change in rates; it\u2019s more about the concern of the migration\u2019s pace.   Rich: We still don\u2019t know what the DSR is and how it will affect different use cases. Exchanges? Large holders? Apps? Retail? Maybe a conservative approach is best.  Vishesh: I agree with you that moving forward, we don\u2019t have a clear eye on what the use case for the DSR is. Though there is a system that exists right now. At the moment, it\u2019s a proxy for existing use cases. E.G., individual users who purchase DAI and get a relatively risk-free yield. We don\u2019t know what happens in the future. Matthew: Everyone loves free alpha; there is no stopping recycling. If we drop SAI DC to 0, then increase the DSR. That\u2019s how you would force one side or the other. Rich: Correct. That\u2019s the aggressive approach.    1:32:56  Taylor: DSR can financially incentivize certain people. There are other things we can do to increase migration speed, which would have a more significant effect than DSR. If we\u2019re going to chat about DSR, do we have data? Is there a financial downside to a slow migration? Is there research on past changes that are similar? E.G., if a slow migration costs Maker $1 million, we could spend $900K to increase the speed.  Cyrus: Rich and I are the fear-mongers of the slow migration. We don\u2019t know how to quantify the cost there. Behind the scenes for managing Maker\u2019s on-chain governance, we have this internal 40-step process for one week\u2019s worth of polling, requiring a lot of cross-functional overhead to get everything executed correctly. Rich: The operational overhead is one part of the cost, but Taylor bought up some other interesting points. Attempting to quantify the cost of a slow migration is an interesting question. Vishesh: The most significant risk or cost comes from managing two systems. Rich: The internal cost is an interesting question. Cyrus: We don\u2019t have data yet. David: Agree, the original point still stands, \u201cit\u2019s been three days.\u201d Rich: Order of the day is due diligence, caution, sane defaults, and responsiveness. Over time we can add in additional governance pieces. Let\u2019s avoid grandfathering in old processes to the new system.    1:37:16  Vishesh: Taking it back to scientific governance, seeing the DSR change often will be an essential topic. Which variables do we want to change, when, and how do we choose which ones?  Cyrus: I want to keep the spread between SF and DSR relatively constant. Making sure the peg stays. It makes drawing signal out of our current data more difficult. Vishesh: That\u2019s supposing that the spread is what you want to keep constant. Cyrus: It\u2019s open for discussion; the quality of the collateral shouldn\u2019t change on a week-to-week basis. We could hopefully change this spread infrequently, once a month or quarter. Vishesh: When something goes wrong, how do you determine the root cause and the right lever to adjust? Since information right now is scarce, we should change one thing at a time.    1:40:34  YEsuETw.png675\u00d7568 14.5 KB   Taylor: This(above) is the original DAO withdrawal contract balance over time. As you can see, the financial incentive was ridiculous, and the primary migration happened in less than two months. There wasn\u2019t a sense of urgency since your DAO-tokens have no value, but one could use them to get ETH back. This incentive fueled a two-month migration from July to September, which perhaps gives us an idea of that minimum, how long the bulk of movement might take.  Cyrus: How much is still in there? Taylor: Balance of withdrawal contract is $$1.142 $ billion vs. supply of $1.152 billion Cyrus: But how much of original was withdrawn? Taylor: No idea. I\u2019m just making a point to track this migration graph against the SAI<>DAI migration graph. Matthew: Exchanges were less robust at the time. Taylor: True! Today is more diverse, both positive and negative. The DAO communication was also centralized on slack and Reddit. Today the community is much more varied: retail vs. sophisticated. I would assume a slower migration is just the way it works today. Reaching all the different audiences and convincing them to migrate. Rich: Depends on how you measure. People will rush the exit despite being slower at the beginning. It won\u2019t end without an Emergency Shutdown. Taylor: A vast bulk of the DAO\u2019s motion happened within the first five days. Partially because ETC showed up, and every whale had to move. We could compare to our current charts and reach conclusions that way.    1:45:48  Cyrus: Doing some quick math if we increase the DSR to 10% and drop the SF to 0 on MCD it will cost us less than $900K a month. That gives us a rough boundary on both costs and timeline.  Rich: A saunter towards the exit is my hope. I think incentivizing speed might create more headaches. Matthew: Hypothetically, if you make the DSR  high but don\u2019t reduce the DC, then what keeps people from returning? Cyrus: Reversing back is constrained by liquidity; it\u2019s not as simple to migrate back and forth(DAI<>SAI). Rich: We don\u2019t want cold wars with all the secondary lending platforms. Cyrus: We have to start making business-oriented decisions and helping the community usher in business decisions. Harder when it\u2019s an apathetic but good use of delegation. Rich: Another good point, since it is the community\u2019s job to determine what to do, maybe a recap or having a business analyst pointing out effects and trade-offs and providing suggestions is an excellent option.

Hop on the mic with questions or type in the chat if it\u2019s too noisy. Let\u2019s keep our schedule as tight as possible today since there is a lot to cover this week. Our governance process is a big discussion point, especially in our current context. Governance is happening right now, in our forums. LongForWisdom\u2019s section will help us review some of the most important threads and discussions. Wouter, Mariano, and Cyrus are here as well to cover technical questions about the system and risk. Developers will do an overview of the OSM and GSM, Cyrus will cover migration. Then we\u2019ll finish with the state of the pegs. I\u2019ll recap our last discussions: our governance system in Sai was great, we iterated, and it helped launch MCD. It was an excellent start to the open governance model we have. I believe that this model alone won\u2019t serve us perfectly in the future. I\u2019ve mentioned that cracks are forming in this model, and it\u2019s becoming more evident that MCD needs more to scale.  We have two protocols to manage, SCD and MCD. One lever on SCD is manageable, but MCD adds more. Since we have additional levers in our control, there is extra complexity for the community to manage. How can we effectively make changes? We\u2019ll also have to keep agility in mind, making continuous voting informed and productive.   Deploying technical fixes alongside Monetary Policy changes can be complicated and problematic. The community has raised problems with bundled Executive Proposals.  There are emerging changes on the road map, and we\u2019ll discuss the GSM today. We need to stay relevant and reliable with our cadence and communication. Especially if there is any weekend activity, a week is not a large amount of time to go through our governance process from start to finish, that consists of a forum poll, Governance Poll, and finally Execute Vote. I\u2019d like to consider solutions to all these problems. I mention a working group to help guide V2 of Governance, adding sophistication and iterating on our process. With deeply engaged stakeholders, forums, some process frameworks, the next step is to treat Maker like a business (project plans, data trackers, owners, etc.). The first step is collecting all the requirements, improvements, and ideas for the governance system. I\u2019ll be outlining the problems for the community in a forum post. From there, we can prioritize problems, scope them, and then we\u2019ll break off into teams and formally approach these issues.   This week, as an example, we were working on transferring the authority of the Maker token to the community. We found out, on the weekend, that our path needed a change, pushing the GSM issue forward on the timeline.  The forums got intense with discussions around 24 hours or seven days as a delay. Other talks focused on whether we should delay the monetary policy changes in favor of the GSM vote. Our addendum with OSM exclusion inspired a few questions too. These conversations brought up more questions about delaying Monetary Policy: Did we decide that? How did we do that? Did we decide if the GSM is a nice to have? Did we consider the trade-offs that the GSM vote implies? What about acting on the weekend?   All this to say, we have to establish a firm process while keeping the forums conversations and points of discussion visible. There are even more questions we\u2019ll ask ourselves:  How to get community buy-in? How to make process canonical? How do we reach consensus? What is a rough consensus? Will the community demand explicit signaling or a bias towards action? Scheduling and calendaring is a real concern.   Once we have a more precise definition, then it\u2019s easier to commit to the proposal, the schedule, and communication. All of these questions and initiatives contribute clearly defining the Governance meta: What does Governance do? How do we do it? DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 16:47   Governance at a Glance Thread  Four active signalling discussion threads this week.    Questions/Discussion on the Emergency Shutdown  Meeoh starts a thread related to emergency shutdown and poses some questions and discussion points. Lots of good engagement here.    Signal Gathering: Request for Adjustment to DSR Phrasing  Hexonaut introduces the idea of voting on the spread, rather than the absolute value, of SF-DSR spread in MCD.    New Idea: Switching to Ranked Choice Voting for the Multiple Choice Governance Votes  Hexonaut suggests that we move to ranked-choice voting rather than first-past-the-post, and lays out a solution to do so with minimal dev work.    Signal Gathering: Poll for SCD Emergency Shutdown  Starting a discussion around ES circumstances. Hopefully, the risk team can illuminate some of the most critical factors.    Signal Gathering: Addendum to the current Poll to Activate the Governance Security Module  Excluding OSM from GSM. It seems as though most are supporting. the exclusion    Signal Gathering: In the case where an emergency technical change to the DCS is required, should we skip monetary policy changes in that week\u2019s executive vote?  LongForWisdom introduces the definitive \u201cto bundle or not to bundle\u201d vote. Providing some data on how the community feels about bundling.    Questions and Discussion 21:59  Rich: That last thread, talking about the decision to skip monetary policy changes in exchange for emergency technical changes, is the perfect test case. Can we touch on some of these issues? The cadence for monetary policy related changes changed right out of the gate with MCD.  It\u2019s worth hashing this out: What is the difference between a fix, upgrade, or new lever? It\u2019s hazy, and I\u2019d like to get a clear signal on how to proceed. In your perspective, based on the forums process and that threads feedback, will we just focus on the GSM and not do Monetary Policy this week? LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a good point. Ideally, we separate engineering and monetary policy changes. Considering we had an emergency engineering change, it made sense to articulate what people thought. For the current thread:  Twelve votes (55%) think we should not include monetary policy changes in the weekly executive in case of any emergency. Two votes (9%) say skip it for this emergency. One vote (4%) we should bundle technical and monetary in the executive. Nine people (remainder) abstaining or no opinion.     Rich: Does that mean we don\u2019t do Monetary Policy this week?  LongForWisdom: That\u2019s your job to decide,(laughs,) you\u2019re the facilitator.   David: Would it make sense for bi-weekly cadence on Monetary Policy, and in the weeks where we don\u2019t have that, we can focus on MIPs, styling, process changes, and technical changes?  Rich: I\u2019d love to evaluate the efficacy of our existing cadences before jumping into bi-weekly commitments. Let\u2019s try to make it data-driven. Mariano Conti: The system is too new to jump to every other week. LongForWisdom: If I hadn\u2019t raised this in the forum, we\u2019d presumably be bundling. Putting this out gave a signal that most people don\u2019t think we should be bundling. Whether we need to do an on-chain vote for this, I don\u2019't know. Rich: That is the question. It will add more wait time if we do an on-chain vote, possibly another week.    27:15  Rich: Right, to review some of the base assumptions: Continuous Approval Voting, or \u2018skin in the game\u2019 voting, where those with the most to lose are the ones participating and watching. Ideally, the Plutarchs are extremely interested in the success of the ecosystem.  We have a polling system, that allows a wider range of people to engage in the signalling process on the forum, which ideally allows the ecosystem to know what moves into an Executive Vote and the thoughts and arguyments behind the process and norms we are establishing here. We needed a way to gather \u201csignal the signal-ers.\u201d Thus, forum debates lead to forum polls. From those forum polls, we craft the on-chain Governance Polls and Executive Votes that only MKR holders can participate in. This is the first version of this process. I don\u2019t think its robust enough, that is why I keep bringing up the topic for discussion.   Rich: LongForWisdom\u2019s thread highlights the issues with what we\u2019re doing tomorrow.  For tomorrow, what does the community want? Is it: Monetary Policy, Monetary Policy plus GSM, or Monetary Policy plus GSM and OSM?  LongForWisdom: Aim of the poll was surfacing what people felt about bundling, what we want to do with that if we disagree, is hard. Rich: It\u2019s probably apparent that I wish the Interim Governance Facilitator to be administrative and not an editorial role. LongForWisdom: If we didn\u2019t post this thread, then we wouldn\u2019t have that information. It\u2019s more than no information, and I would prefer that we look at the majority vote. Cmooney: Forum polls should surface signal for actual Governance Polls, where the impact is measured by real MKR voting. We can\u2019t assume what the community wants until there is that poll. Rich: That would imply that we do need to bundle at least for this week. Cmooney: Right, but we need the technical changes. I agree that bundling often becomes pork-barrel politics, and nobody wants that. Rich: This raises an exciting challenge to Monetary Policy. If we can say, \u201coh, this week, we just won\u2019t do it.\u201d Then why do it in the first place? David: It\u2019s unclear that making Monetary Policy-based changes week over week is necessary. Critical technical changes should have priority as they come. We don\u2019t know the efficacy of these changes, and we\u2019re unsure if waiting is better. I think Monetary Policy changes may take priority based on how severe the problem is. Bundling them adds a delaying risk, making it even longer before we deploy necessary fixes. LongForWisdom: Ideal situation, yes poll would work. We haven\u2019t had an on-chain \u201ccan we bundle\u201d vote. At no point have MKR holders said yes I want to bundle parameter adjustments and technical changes together. Rich: Interesting. That\u2019s clarifying. Perhaps the bug-fix to the flopper vote began that process for us. We didn\u2019t formalize it, though. Setting up a procedure in the case of an emergency fix would be helpful. E.G., if we have an emergency fix this week, then delaying Monetary Policy by a week can be the assumed precedent. This procedure can keep us out of decision paralysis. LongForWisdom: Right, the Governance Poll confirms what people want.   Cmooney: So did we land in a happy accident where Monetary Policy isn\u2019t changing so we don\u2019t have to discuss this?  LongForWisdom: This happened last time too. Rich: Ok, that\u2019s an excellent place to move on, we\u2019ll jump to the forums and our eventual working group.    Risk Wouter Summary of the GSM issue, update on development of Instand Access Modules 37:29  On Monday, there was a blog post by Micah Zoltu about the lack of a Governance Security Module delay. The delay defends against governance attacks. A governance attack is the same as a vote, but the winning proposal is malicious.  The GSM creates a delay between a passing vote and the system change. It\u2019s also in effect for far-reaching updates, E.G., modules in the system. The delay allows the community to check code to make sure the changes are accurate and not malicious.   If it is malicious, there are two reactions:  The community can do a second Executive Vote canceling the previous executive within 24 hours. If that\u2019s not possible, then there can be an ES. If you do this, you burn your MKR and wind down the system, giving Dai holders the equivalent amount of collateral. Allowing all users to be ultimately protected.   The downside is that the delay applies to all governance changes. If we could discriminate between malicious and honest modifications, then we could cancel them right away. There is no way to do that without the manual judgement of the MKR holders. So all proposals go through this delay.  The delay may be problematic for changing risk parameters, but the real tricky part is emergency patches. Which, by design, are deployed in the same process. If there is a delay of 24 hours, a malicious actor can exploit the vulnerability. The short delay gives us the ability to fix things quickly and defend against governance attacks.   We put up a proposal that is strong technically and a good compromise. It minimizes governance attacks and reduces risks from exposing a vulnerability in patch-fixes.  The solution is: increasing the delay to 24 hours but, excluding the OSM from the GSM (since the OSM also has a delay). The reasoning is: we can freeze the OSM if we see price manipulation. If the OSM were subject to the GSM, then we would have to wait 24 hours for the freeze to take effect. The delay would prevent us from having this as a defensive tool, therefore it should be an exception. We should be able to include this on the Executive Vote tomorrow, updating the GSM but excluding the OSM freeze method.  A quick reminder that there are two freezing methods. One just stops the price feed until another Executive Vote; the second disables the OSM. This approach makes drawing debt and triggering ES impossible.   The attack we\u2019re most concerned about is a governance attacker that triggers the OSM, blocking ES, and then using that venue to initiate a governance attack. The team analyzed the stop and the void method. The right technical solution was to go for the stop method.    Questions and Discussion 48:50  Ironrand: Can the Governance Security Module be switched off temporarily? To allow an honest technical fix to be uploaded promptly.  Wouter: Yes, definitely. Cmooney: But it has to go through the delay. Wouter: Exactly. Turning it off will be subject to delay: the first step would be to disable it, then once disabled, you can apply bug fixes without delay. In reality, that would be difficult. Since you would need someone to tell the community, \u201ctrust us, we found a serious vulnerability.\u201d Rich: It also opens up a 24 hour window of opportunity for an attacker. Wouter: That was a secondary consideration, but yes, that too. Once you ask to disable the delay, you draw attention to the vulnerability.    50:58  ChrisBlec: Does it make sense to incrementally build up to a 24 hour delay over a month or two?  Wouter: Two questions, so I\u2019ll answer both. What can we do if the delay is enabled?  At that point, we\u2019d need creative solutions. In Crypto, more broadly, we\u2019ve seen vulnerabilities exploited by good attackers. There are several solutions, but they depend on context. There might be a way to structure the patch, coordinate with MKR holders, change a single parameter, E.G., setting the Debt Ceiling at zero. This process would allow you to set the patch up for quick execution without pointing to the specific vulnerability that\u2019s getting the patch. If these solutions don\u2019t work, then the ESM is the last line of defense, burning 50K MKR. Patching the critical vulnerability and migrating to a new system. It\u2019s a painful process to go through to solve issues that way. This is why we started with a delay of 0. With a new system like MCD, the chances for technical issues are highest in the beginning, and then they diminish over time. Whereas governance attacks are a constant risk.   Wouter: To Chris\u2019 question, on whether it\u2019s beneficial to build up the delay or not, as mentioned before, if we find a critical vulnerability we can\u2019t have it exposed for 24 hours before. Depending on the issue, you could find a window to expose the weakness, but not enough time to write an exploit. Assuming the community sees the patch reasonable.  Building the delay incrementally over the coming weeks wouldn\u2019t have an advantage. Rather than changing it multiple times, 24 hours is a good starting point. If we do detect a critical vulnerability, we can decrease the delay to 30 mins, for example, explaining to the community what the patch is and what the vulnerability is. If the community isn\u2019t convinced, they can pull the trigger. 30 mins aren\u2019t enough time to reverse engineer and use the exploit.     ChrisBlec: How would you override the 24-hour delay to fit 30 mins?  Wouter: That would be a governance decision, subject to the governance delay. To clarify, you put the 30 min delay to an Executive Vote that passes. Then after 24 hours, you can initiate the 30 min delay. Then it\u2019s time to submit the patch and set up a time with the community to explain the patch. Then activate it.    58:28  Chrisblec: So that vote would happen without revealing the vulnerability. AKA \u201cTrust us, we need to vote on 30 min delay.\u201d Then you would reveal whats going on. That sounds like a move away from a decentralized governance structure, right?  Wouter: It would still be decentralized because the community can always act, and we\u2019re taking the time to explain it. Much of this is hypothetical; it doesn\u2019t have to be a half-hour; I just picked that time interval as an example.  It could be an exploit that takes days to attack but one hour to explain; in that case, we would put that time delay to the vote. Decentralization here comes from community power in their decision making: blocking actions. We\u2019ve mentioned Instant Access Modules, though we haven\u2019t shared the designs yet on this call. They follow the same principle where voters can cancel actions if they want, and still hold the ultimate power of effecting change. Rich: Decentralization is a loaded term; it\u2019s a spectrum. Either you\u2019re closer to full decentralization or not. People here talking in the forums and on the call are participating in decentralized governance. Understanding where we are on that spectru is important. Chrisblec: \u2018Trustless\u2019 would have been a better word than decentralized to illustrate my point. Rich: Love that word, you can define that more than \u201cdecentralized.\u201d There is another model still, one like a MakerDAO security team where trusted actors in the ecosystem vet security changes. Mariano Conti: Right now, there isn\u2019t a lot of people with knowledge of the system. I think the community trusts the Maker Foundation\u2019s engineering team to do what\u2019s best for the system. I expect over time the community will learn to delegate their trust to parties outside the Maker Foundation\u2019s teams. Rich: Right, that\u2019s why we exist in the first place, to secure and bootstrap the system. From that context, we are trusted by the community implicitly. There are definitely discussions to be had about self-securing the system as a community. Chrisblec: It would be counterintuitive that new decisions should increase the amount of trust required. I think decisions that increase the need for trust is a step backward. Cmooney: The foundation internally thinks of itself adversarially to the protocol. There is no elegant trustless solution for bug discolsures and patching. Aside from that, all of us agree with the sentiment that the mission of the foundation is to move us to a world where the Foundation doesn\u2019t have that trust relationship anymore. Michael: This trustless-ness is an entirely new area of research. We have a problem to solve, the tools available to solve it, and we have to figure out how to reach a trustless solution going forward. Wouter: I\u2019d like to bring up long term average vs. temporary measures. In the case of a critical vulnerability, falling back to a \u2018trusted\u2019 model may be the right thing to do in the absence of a trustless solution. It\u2019s a single operation requiring trust at that very moment. Immediately after the operation you end up back in the more trustless world. We should distinguish the two, the current solutions and the world towards which we are moving.    1:09:13  Tim Black: Quantifying what vulnerabilities are critical or not, is that internal or open?  Wouter: The Hacker0ne bug bounty is a clear example where the severity of the bugs are quite well defined. Risk analysis is half art and half science and ultimately depends on your risk appetite. There is no perfect end-to-end scientific model. For the dev team, working towards an objective scoring model would be great. Quantifying \u201chow critical is this bug?\u201d requires building an objective model.    Cyrus State of Migration 1:12:22  vreS0rl.png923\u00d7865 54.7 KB   Dai supply is at 61.4 million, with 1.2 million + ETH locked. Sai supply is around $51 million, with 900K ETH locked. We\u2019ve seen a flippening between the protocols. The total supply between both is at $113 million, which is higher than when MCD launched. DSR Utilization rate is up, sitting at 24%.  DSR UR by itself doesn\u2019t push the Dai price up. What\u2019s really needed is for investors to convert outside capital into Dai. The higher the DSR UR, the less circulating supply, or float, is in the markets.   On Uniswap, DAI liquidity has surpassed the SAI liquidity.    Dai in the migration contract is not emptying as quickly as it was in the first few weeks. Sai liquidity is no longer the bottleneck for the migration. CDP owners are now the bottleneck, we should think about how best to incentivize them to move over. Last week we ended up with a negative SCD spread versus the DSR. Creating a small arbitrage opportunity. I saw at least one market maker mint Sai, convert it, and put it in the DSR. Varying opinions on the efficacy, but I thought it was decent, though the payoff from the arb wasn\u2019t tremendous. If we wanted to target CDP owners, the two most straightforward methods are to increase the SCD SF or to decrease the MCD SF. This change would make it more appealing to move into MCD. Either option should keep the pegs in mind, and we should evaluate increasing the DSR to accommodate. If we increased the SCD SF that could create problems with sell-side liquidity. Compound still has $12 million Sai, $9 million borrowed. Sai borrowers on Compound may be using their Sai to borrow other assets. If people borrowed other tokens through Compound, then the spread with the DSR might not be the feature they\u2019re seeking. There might be a few roadblocks to getting Compound Sai to migrate over.  Questions and Discussion 01:20:51  n/a name: Is there any analysis on more significant holders of Sai, similar to what you presented last week?  Cyrus: Doing a long tail chain-analysis of CDP and Vault holders is a medium-term project that is not in my priorities for the short-term. Makerscan has some of these statistics. Analyzing positions granularly might be difficult at the moment.    Sai Analysis Vishesh 1:23:12 Relevant links Live Migration Data MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Insights  IAKODSz.png1211\u00d7748 168 KB   We saw large quantities of Sai wipes about 10 days ago. The rate of these wipes has fallen slowly since then.   cxsqe5s.png1053\u00d7191 50.3 KB   Comparatively, DAI came right back up, showing that it was minted on the MCD side.   dZaNVeL.png1317\u00d7550 154 KB   Dai 24hr VWAP is steady at around a dollar for both pegs. There has been comparitavely low trading volume in the last 24 hours.   HkYyicR.jpg2230\u00d7885 145 KB   Low trading volume for Sai over the last 24 hours as well. Especially since there are fewer trading venues for Sai. You can find some trades farther below a dollar price. Since Oasis cut ETH<>DAI trades on the UI, it looks like these price anomalies are direct on-contract trades.   dZaNVeL.png1317\u00d7550 154 KB   Light trading for both. I think interest rates do have a role in how these assets have been trading lately.   wibDRLh.png1434\u00d7180 62.9 KB   Most Dai comes from ETH and a small amount from BAT, we\u2019re obviously focusing on ETH right now. This will get more fragmented as we grow MCD.  Secondary Lending Platforms  jj1fvUb.jpg1502\u00d71058 130 KB   It\u2019s currently cheaper to borrow Dai on Compound than to mint new Dai on Maker. This should incentivize more borrow volume on Compound\u2019s Dai market. That incentive would lead to a higher interest rate on borrowing, closing the gap between the Compound borrow rate and MCD SFs eventually.   OpewwDb.jpg1832\u00d7979 133 KB   Borrow volume for Sai has come down significantly. Supply volume for Sai has come down too.   zV47QAX.jpg1964\u00d71110 153 KB   The UR on Compound has cratered for Sai.   6fs62AL.png1425\u00d7141 37.4 KB   Fascinatingly, there is a $9 million pool of SAI sitting there(~$12 million supplied and ~$3  million borrowed). What\u2019s interesting is why, especially given the better DSR rate.   e4dOvSc.png856\u00d7458 64.4 KB   Roughly 1/5th of Dai supply is on Compound; for SCD, it was about 30% at the highest point. We can expect this to rise as MCD supply rises and migration finishes out. The weird persistence of Sai supply is the only part that we\u2019d want to understand.   tXtNiE6.png1225\u00d7741 175 KB   I ran some numbers to check on the risk in MCD Vaults. It looks like, on a weighted average basis, the Collateralization Rate of MCD Vaults is around 300%. Sai was roughly $148 Million, collateralizing $60 million Sai, which is a 246% CR. I went checking to see if there is a change between SCD and MCD collateralization. Comparatively, it looks like MCD is slightly higher.

My name is Rich Brown and I\u2019m the Interim Governance Facilitator. It\u2019s been a furiously active 10-days for the foundation and ecosystem since Black Thursday. We\u2019ve had a ridiculous amount of work. There is a sizeable contingent of people at the foundation that haven\u2019t stopped working since Black Thursday. My heart goes out to all of them, because I know how that feels like.  We have a point in time here where we can take a breath and try to figure out what the F just happened. Numerous teams, external consultants, and domain experts that are reviewing all kinds of information, going through code and chain analysis, people are making models, and are trying to figure out what this downturn did to the DeFi space. What it did to the protocol, seeing how it responded and figuring out the ways it needs to be improved in the future. It\u2019s a more complicated process than people might expect, and we\u2019ve taken a bit of heat for not having something published sooner. There is a delicate balance between best guesses or providing empty calories to the ecosystem versus having something with substance, veracity, and science behind it. And we chose the second, so information is coming soon about what happened. But there are other issues in the ecosystem that need to be addressed. We\u2019ve made some changes to the protocol, the governance ecosystem has come together to adapt rapidly to an environment that\u2019s adversarial, which is the environment the protocol was designed for, that we all signed up for. Hopefully, we come out of the other end of this process a stronger and more robust protocol. But, the decisions that have been made in the last couple of weeks obviously are not written in stone. They can be updated and improved upon. That\u2019s what the next couple of months will be about as we try to figure out what universe we\u2019re living in now and what tasks we need to do to shore up the ecosystem. We have other issues at hand. Like the technical issues with the flop auctions that I won\u2019t speak on, i\u2019ll let Kurt pick that up. The other major discussion we need to talk about is the impact of the 0 bid auctions. This is a huge conversation, and the implications that will be had by our community and ecosystem are wide-ranging and are hard to predict. I\u2019m looking forward to this, like you wouldn\u2019t believe. It\u2019s hard to imagine but this will become a marvelous teaching moment for our community. Examining this moment will help our community and Governance ecosystem. We have a bad situation here. We\u2019re at a point where the community has the levers, sophistication, processes to self organize, and the human resources to pull that together, which is unbelievably heart-warming and encouraging. The discussion to be had is the 0 bid auctions. A lot of people were impacted by that. And the community has a decision to make about how it wants to respond to the situation.  There are several threads in the forum: one is more a testimonial of who is impacted, another about potential technical solutions; and the other one escapes me. More about this from LongforWisdom in a minute. What we want to do today is have a public discussion about what was in those signal threads. What this looks like for our protocol, and what actions the community feels best is to take. From my perspective, this is going to be one of the most important activities that the community has engaged in so far. We\u2019ve hit a lot of milestones and have done a lot of amazing work. And in the brand new world of protocol governance, this is going to be one of the first tests of, \u201cWhat happens when things goes wrong.\u201d I\u2019m very much looking forward to that conversation.   Kurt will go first, Kurt, do you have a presentation?   Discussions happen in the forum.   Flop Auctions Kurt Blocked Flops and Debt Auctions 6:14  Forum post: Everything you need know about Flop Auctions Kurt\u2019s slides   1032\u00d7553   990\u00d7578   1061\u00d7585   green words represents terms in the system   1070\u00d7581   Red words represent alternative nomenclature not used in the code, can be found in literature like Pymaker  Awe always has a non-zero balance. System surplus/deficit aren\u2019t precise terms, as the total credit of the system may either be positive (surplus) or negative (deficit) when you subtracted the Awe from the joy.   1060\u00d7543   1020\u00d7537   1020\u00d7519   1023\u00d7499   1082\u00d7536   1046\u00d7531   988\u00d7515   1051\u00d7532   1054\u00d7542   In heal, debt is healed by canceling out woe with joy.    1062\u00d7514   1018\u00d7507   In kiss, debt is healed by canceling out Ash instead of woe.   1061\u00d7551   If we are close to a debt auction, we can use kiss as demonstrated below:   1041\u00d7534   1035\u00d7529   1041\u00d7515   Here, we cancel out the Ash with the joy.   973\u00d7522   This leaves us with no Ash, no joy, no surplus. We can proceed to a flop auction.   1055\u00d7525    Heal takes woe and gets rid of it. That means there isn\u2019t enough woe to initiate the flop auction.   1080\u00d7522   The system should have been able to flop because the system was in a state where it should have a debt auction to cancel out the woe. Instead, the heal function was called, the woe was healed, and we could not have another flop auction.   1053\u00d7528   Once you miss the flop auction, you cannot restart it without some sort of intervention.   1054\u00d7515   1054\u00d7557   1025\u00d7518   We\u2019ve processed through the whole sin queue, so there aren\u2019t more flop auctions that are expected in the future. This means that the debt is stuck as ash.   923\u00d7513   1011\u00d7446   This keeper update requires compliance, which is difficult in a blockchain world. This will make things better, but it isn\u2019t a complete solution.   1022\u00d7529   1017\u00d7504  Questions and Comments 13:56  LFW: You mentioned an array of sin for users. Is that the vaults themselves, or the owners of the vaults? What does that look like in practice?  K: We\u2019ll discuss that more on the next slide. There is no association between sin balances and vaults whatsoever. Backed debt is assigned to a vault holder, but it is not sin because there is collateral there, which is backing.    32:46  Rich: Do we require a mid-week executive to change any potential parameters, or do we wait until Friday?  Kurt: We should do this promptly. With Flop auctions not complete, people will be holding Dai with a multiplicative effect and high demand for Dai. This can affect many people and is especially true given the state of the peg. It would help if we can complete it sooner. Even if we\u2019re unsure of the effects, we reduce the number of variables that might be affecting the peg. The sooner we do it, the less chance we are taking that the market conditions will change. If we do it before Friday\u2019s Executive, we\u2019ll avoid mixing monetary policy with a technical fix. LFW: Once we do this, do we have to wait 6.5 days for flops to be triggered again? Kurt. No, you could start flops as part of a spell, but it would be better to include a hard-coded time for the auctions to stop. There is no 6.5-day delay. Rich: The point I want to raise is that there are issues with continuous approval voting. Urgency/apathy/denial cycles are common, with apathy setting in at the end of urgency. We have MKR on the executives due to the urgency, but once these disasters pass, it gets hard to ratify regularly scheduled executives. There are other factors too, but the flip side is that after 9 pm on Thursday, enough MKR moves before Friday\u2019s executive vote and bumps the emergency one out of the queue. We need to consider how much MKR needs to move. If technical and monetary policy go in together, it improves the likelihood that something goes through; this is important for the community to consider.    Compensating Vault Holders Discussion LongForwisdom Compensating Vault Holders 38:08  I imagine most of you are aware of these threads. Vault holders are demanding/expecting compensation due to the auction and some extent the oracle system not working as intended. If anyone has thoughts on this, feel free to jump in. The context is: Vault owners were liquidated due to $0 bid auctions. Also, the on-chain oracle wasn\u2019t updating in a timely matter. There are a lot of points on the other side saying we shouldn\u2019t compensate people and summarizing all sides is difficult. One point is that Oasis Borrow defines a liquidation penalty at 13%. Most vault holders believed that this was the max penalty on top of their debt. That is not correct, but potentially this is a UI messaging failure. There is also the PR/optics for compensation to consider. Again, points to be made on both sides, namely the code is on the chain and auditable. The issue is if we compensate users now, do we set an expectation that we\u2019ll do the same in the future?  Mitote: There is a signaling thread also posted by Joshua. LFW: MM opened the first thread, there is a second in which the vault holders are reporting their losses, and Joshua\u2019s too. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that forum polls have a drawback. Naturally, Vault owners are in the forums and vote on polls. I think a potential solution is to have multiple on-chain proposals for MKR holders to vote on. Rich: I hope that people affected by this situation are on the call, so thoughts or comments, please add them to the discussion. Long you touched on some of the key points and really important issues. I think this will be one of the most important discussions that the community engages with. It relates to core philosophical principles that need to be addressed here. Immutability, compensation, code as law, reputational impact, opening doors that are difficult to close the future. There are mechanical and implementation issues that come up depending on how we handle this. Let\u2019s brainstorm on some options; I imagine that, based on how vocal people have been on this call, that there are strong opinions on this call. The sooner we toss out ideas, the sooner we can arrive at a consensus on the forums. Mitote: An obvious main point to clarify is liquidations and uncertainty. Especially if there is more risk of losing your collateral. There is no algorithm for compensating vault holders. Rich; That\u2019s an interesting discussion to start with. Easier than philosophy. Hasn\u2019t there been some numbers discussion in the forums? Mitote: MakerMan has brought up numbers. MM: You can look at where people liquidate, someone posted the math. 66% +13% hits, and you get no more than 21% back (including the liquidation penalty). I take a business focus; at most, you get 10.5% back. I\u2019ve refrained from posting this, but you can look at zero bid auctions as the most significant issue. Someone else posted a different scenario, but I split them into classes. $0 bids and then everything else. If I rough the numbers out as a total, 69K ETH was lost, so 10% of that is 6900 ETH split again by whomever and however. Max exposure makes sense. Vault #2288 flipped half of his ETH; 2500 at $75. You can see a fair amount of sophisticated activity to redeem this loss. If the auctions were functioning faster, you wouldn\u2019t have found that great a bid price, ETH was congested, and Dai peg was off, it would have even been harder. Based on the current system structure, the idea that you get 13% and you get your collateral auctioned off at your liquidation price is unreasonable. Only tit-for-tat would have that kind of \u201cgood\u201d pricing. There are two reasons, and I try to look at the whole community, advocating for vault and Dai holders. From their perspective:  Vault owners didn\u2019t understand the full nature of the risk(s). They didn\u2019t expect to be liquidated at $0 bid. Which is the real crux?   Those issues (alongside some venting and opinion surfacing) is why I put the threads up, especially the compensation thread. We\u2019re getting a decent amount of drive by\u2019s, unfortunately. I thought of these threads as a cathartic mechanism for the entire system to come in and digest together.    49:49  Rich: We appreciate it, and I want to dig into it a bit there, thank you(MakerMan) for taking the initiative in the forums like that. Are there two camps forming? \u201cBecause the number 13 is on the site, we all expected that only 13% would be seized\u201d vs. \u201cwe didn\u2019t get what we thought we should have gotten from the auction mechanism.\u201d Is there a big dichotomy like that? or is it more people agitating for what should have happened in those 0 bid auctions?  LFW: There isn\u2019t a strict dichotomy. Considering the 0 bid auctions as a separate class from the other auctions might not be the best idea. Other vaults got un-favored pricing, even though it wasn\u2019t strictly a 0-bid. MM; If auctions go at 60-70%, the protocol eats a lot of the loss. The deal here is auctions hitting way below wipes people out, and Maker eats the rest. That\u2019s why I think digesting it is so hard. In terms of the way the system functions, if the bids are 80 or 70% of your liquidation value back. They already got 2/3 their ETH value for liquidating them. LFW: I think communication about penalties is worth examining. Is that our responsibility? or should users have to research liquidations and understand that? MM: On the protocol perspective, the onus is on them. They should have researched that. I\u2019ve seen auctions go in the real world, and things hit at 1-3% of actual resale value. Talking about distressed assets? \u201cpft\u201d we don\u2019t even have liquidity in there. Liquidity is a truth no one is facing.  Those liquidity mechanisms can be improved, but they were given a loan and had that money in hand. If they lose that ETH and have Dai on hand and they can\u2019t pay it back, well, that\u2019s how the system works. Mitote: The issue is that the interfaces didn\u2019t address it. All the information is available, but without explicit pointing to the risk(s) is the point. MM: How do you include the information like that for every interface? In crypto, it\u2019s like every investment. \u201cDon\u2019t put more in than you can lose.\u201d Nothing is guaranteed, particularly in the last market drop. I wanted people to blow off steam on the 0 bid auctions, which I felt needed a proposal to remedy. Even if the proposal was something like; If the OSM price and the live price is like 20% off, Maker should just ride the collateral through. Screw the auction. If you have an 80% price dislocation, you might as well auction MKR and print money, no point to pad it with an auction.    56:28  LFW: Two points struck me. One is that people lost all their Dai, but they leveraged up, and no one forced their hands to do that.  MM: Correct. Rich: While you dig up the second point, we heard from one side of the aisle, are there other contrary opinions, anyone affected by the situation want to share opinions? LFW: The second point, the UI, is a good topic. The protocol can\u2019t be responsible for every UI, though. Mitote: We could communicate with groups making UI\u2019s. There isn\u2019t an infinite number; the biggest ones at least could have better messaging. LFW: Anyone can write a UI on the protocol, and we can\u2019t stop that. Mitote: We\u2019re not responsible for all of them, but I think getting the messaging to the most popular ones is possible. LFW: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s hard to do; it\u2019s impossible to take responsibility for even half of them. We can\u2019t be responsible for some amount of teams building UI\u2019s. MM: The normal system is a banking system that has laws and rules about who can make loans. What the rules are for liquidations is what we\u2019re missing, it throws the onus on Governance and the system therein to be clear about the system and the hazards thereof. I don\u2019t know how to communicate this to people: \u201cyou are responsible for your own money.\u201d Systems and laws exist outside to protect people, do we want to get to the point where regulators come after the protocol based on their assumptions. E.g., informing people of the real risks and hazards. It sucks that we had to go through this as an example. LFW: It would be nice to hear from the compensation side. In the sidebar, one point is \u201cthe personal responsibility is not directly important, the goal is giving users the confidence to use the system in the future. Especially for those who got burned.\u201d Mitote; We don\u2019t want to give confidence when we aren\u2019t confident. LFW: That\u2019s where I have an issue too. If we compensate now, then we\u2019re setting up expectations for the future. If confidence comes as a result of being compensated in a situation like this, it\u2019s not sustainable. Mitote: Since we communicated in a way that presented confidence when we shouldn\u2019t have, maybe we compensate users this time. Moving forward, we can be a lot more clear in our communications, so future compensation under a similar scenario is not warranted. MM: We could always provide our own insurance. Buffer the surplus in advance. Setting the system to be more robust. Sacrificing the PR on 0 option bids is a tougher call. MM: If that ETH had all liquidated at a fair price, I don\u2019t think there would have been enough Dai to soak it up. Like $75 in the crash, I don\u2019t know if that would have even cleared. I still think it would have been below the 75% threshold the way the market moved. While I have a PR sympathy, to appease people at whatever number it is: 6K ETH and divide it up. Pick a number 10% or something; right now, we have these holes that make it difficult. LFW: Insurance is an interesting idea for later. Coming back to effective communications. We need to be clear about what do we mean by \u201cwe.\u201d Is it because Oasis UI wasn\u2019t clear is that why we compensate? Some set of users used DeFi saver. MM: I think our documentation should include a significant disclaimer about the hazards and risks. LFW: Core maker sites have that, and yes, I agree. MM: I read Reddit and Maker documentation. It wasn\u2019t that difficult to surface the risks. I guess we could make it blatantly obvious. The hazards of owning Dai, owning MKR, opening vaults, etc. There is a slew of risks with holding Dai and liquidity risks, for example.    1:05:22  Charlie: I\u2019ve been asking some questions in the sidebar: have we calculated on the part of Vault holders, what the cumulative liability is (in the rosiest case)?  MM: Approximately 13 or 14K ETH. LFW: It would be good to do this math. Charlie: We should have that math and get a number on the table. Beyond philosophically, there is a difference between an abstract and a number. If we scope the discussion down to how much of an amount is there, it makes it easier. Setting a better precedent for the community. LFW: we need all the data. What would users have expected? What was the price? What\u2019s the worst and best case of what they should have gotten back. Basing on oracles and keeper activity at that moment. If we approach this with clear numbers and a spectrum (in the best case you would have gotten X, in the worst-case Y, in the market probably Z), then we could determine what a reasonable price would be for compensation if we chose that. Someone taking the lead on that would be helpful. We\u2019re going to need a list of vaults, scraping the chain, applying those heuristics, and having concrete data points. Rich: There is auditing that needs to get done. Knowing where the vaults came from, and people signaling actual ownership of these things would be helpful. LFW: is there anyone who wants to take that lead and compile that data?    1:09:01  MM: If we look at this article, the max is 13K ETH, we can use this as a heuristic.  Jernej: Does this assume keepers didn\u2019t profit? Charlie: The number is assuming they bid the fair market price. MM: The number assumes they got the liquidation price. That\u2019s the assumption of the liquidation price for the money priced at auction. LFW: This is the thing about including keeper data in the numbers. They need to make a profit so they would pay a little less. Kurt: let me add color on calculating that number: at liquidation, the value of your ether is 150% the value of your debt. There is a 13% liquidation penalty. The debt bumps from there. Let\u2019s use numbers: $100 Dai on $150 ETH debt needs to raise $113. In the auction, there is a technical detail where the price can only change 3% each time. Expecting keepers to bid rationally falls within a range of where bidding stops for keeper profitability. Adding that in, (150-116) / 150 gets to that 21% figure. MM: That\u2019s about right. LFW: This is helpful to give us a general overview that needs a big old spreadsheet. All the liquidated vaults, all the prices they got hit at, and the price range that would have happened optimally. Pulling the data from the chain with scripts. To make a fair decision.    1:12:53  MM: We know the total ETH in the 0 bid auctions. I think it\u2019s best to split the difference here. Portion it out at 10% of what they were liquidated at to all the 0 bid liquidated vaults.  LFW: To compensate at all, we need that data. MM: That\u2019s all in that medium article. I haven\u2019t confirmed it, but the data looks correct. LFW: I don\u2019t think a manual review is necessary, but it would make sense to verify the data and apply for the same compensation. Plus, an output list of all the vaults. Charlie: I have a couple of suggestions; data first party on the 0 liquidated vaults. Data on a range of scenarios based on what holders could have been anticipating receiving had they not been liquidated at zero. The chat has surfaced some of the factors. We know the upper band, we could apply a constant modifier to it(or with the data, we could get more sophisticated.) At that point, we\u2019d have hard data on, in a range of scenarios, what they expected to receive. From there we have two mechanisms do we remedy this  One is diverting SF\u2019s to it. Minting new MKR through flop auctions.   Charlie: I\u2019m not suggesting we should compensate them, but just establishing how to look at it. Regardless of knowing the risks, Something went idiosyncratically wrong. Optically this isn\u2019t fantastic. It makes it a lot easier to have any conversation without the information displayed. Ultimately if it\u2019s $1 Million, or something, that\u2019s not that much money to compensate people. LFW: The philosophical examination is: the DAO should have consistent decision making. Anytime we make a decision, it sets a precedent. In the future, if we want to make a decision, we need to think about how/why that might be different in the future. While they seem less important than optics, we must consider the reasons why.    1:17:56  Charlie: I\u2019m not sure if the analysis is out of if this has been discussed, but there was most certainly an attack on the 0 bids. The mempool dynamics at the time is indicative of a specific attack(not someone who wrote better keeper software when everyone else\u2019s went down.) It looks like an incredibly sophisticated attack to me. It\u2019s not like this happened by chance. They exploited an opportunity from the Maker specific infrastructure/software and the greater environmental conditions. It was specifically exploited by an intelligent actor. It\u2019s not like it \u201cjust happened, and could again.\u201d I label it as a different conversation because of that reason, personally.  LFW & MM: Share the analysis once you get it! Charlie: I spoke with some people, including Phil Daian, people from the ETH Foundation, Blocknative, Lev Livnev, and others. There is quite a bit of brainpower behind analyzing it. This was likely a novel mempool attack targeting different infrastructure layers in a new way; It seems quite likely that it was premeditated. MM: Then, any discussion about compensation comes secondary to understanding if there was an attack on the greater ETH infrastructure layer. I\u2019d been waiting on hearing for system attack vectors Charlie: I apologize for drawing out the conversation this way without concrete data. There is no evidence for miner collusion; there is evidence for attacking multiple layers across the stack. I think that analysis will come out in a week. MM: That\u2019ll transform the optics. We should table compensation until understanding all the details.    1:22:38  Rich: Well, we don\u2019t need to halt. There is work to be done, internal analysis, etc. The outcome and the decisions for the community can be affected by all kinds of post-mortems and chain analysis in the coming weeks. There is still utility in models and what things look like in the short term.  MM: Kurt suggested another group doing on-chain analytics comparing their findings to the medium article. We can\u2019t decide without all the information. LFW: Agreed. Jernej: Could we at least communicate what the prerequisites are to vault owners to continue this discussion. LFW: Great point, and we don\u2019t have to stop conversations. Before we make a decision, we need that analysis. There was also a question being raised about compensating people for Dai being off-peg. Rich: We need to understand if this is an adversarial ecosystem of competing protocols fighting for mindshare and network effects or if it\u2019s the other model, the real-world model, with all kinds of rules and regulations. In our world, we\u2019ve seen Opyn and Nexus Mutual spawn themselves up to hedge against those risks.

                    "content": "1:26:14  William Remor: One suggestion for communications. I know Maker can\u2019t take responsibility for every UI using the underlying protocol. The point is: liquidations happens due to risk appetite for vault owners. There is still probabilistic math on system collateralization. Communicating to vault owners a probabilistic loss about how much collateral they could lose in a significant event would move responsibility back to them. That puts it on them for putting their money in the system and taking on that risk. That\u2019s one way of communicating it on the main interface. That they shouldn\u2019t leverage. It could be based on math, looking at price valuations upfront. I think it would help folks who leverage.  LFW: Models about how likely something is going to go wrong might be beneficial. Showing it to them upfront, we can assume that Oasis UI, maybe, would do it. But I don\u2019t know how to force people to be aware. Mitote: You can advertise the models, risks, and everything we do know about how it all works. LFW: I agree we haven\u2019t that hasn\u2019t been overly advertised. We can\u2019t guarantee that someone has seen it. Mitote: If this is the main focus, you can work with the biggest ones, so more people see it. MM: When you borrow Dai, have a chart with the 90/80/60\u2014>10 % on your collateral price. If someone sees that 75% mark and 0 collateral, how could you complain about the liquidation price visible? Asking \u201cwhat do I get if it\u2019s below 20\u201d that seems ridiculous to me. Even TOC that says: \u201cdo you understand these risks\u201d then get Dai. LFW: We could make an API that populates that info into anyone who builds a UI. WR: I think the way it provides extra information to take on the risk. The way Vishesh does with the distribution of collateralization ratios. It makes the risk appetite clear. Understanding that risk is key, if you don\u2019t get it, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in the space. Risk rather than greed should be the measure. MM: I posited to Vishesh that now that we have the chart that you are talking about, I want those 90, 80, 60-50, 20, I want to those as lines on a running a chart so that you have a chart of risk appetite vs. the snapshot that gives us every once in a while or that we can look at. We need a graph of this risk appetite. What I\u2019m seeing is, when the markets settle down, you can tell me what you see, but I\u2019ve seen that the system goes back to this 10 percent down, and we lose 10 percent of our collateral. 50% down, and it\u2019s 50% of our collateral. Only when the markets have taken a hit does that start to skew, but then over time, it starts to normalize. It\u2019s almost like a risk-collateral optimization game that our people are plying. And it looks like we kind of land in similar areas.  Right now, we go down 50%; we lose just about 50% of our collateral. I found it interesting to observe over time that it looks like the risk appetite kind of change, but it looks like a market event not necessarily because of the risk appetite changes. And what the risk ratios do over time is important, and we need to see them as data for science. WR: I\u2019ve observed similar dynamics around that, and it was counterintuitive from a risk perspective. I could not understand it from the human aspect of greediness going into that.  Mitote: Cyrus has also pointed out that qualitative models are really important aspects of risk analysis will be important for future model making and understanding of risk and collateral. It\u2019s more complicated than just what price and how much collateral incurs losses. But I do think that this is a good place to start.      Post-discussion Brief by Rich 1:35:57  This won\u2019t be the last discussion we have on this topic. We will have some takeaways and some people working on these models. There has been speculation about the root causes of these issues, hopefully, some more clarity about what happened and why. We should have a post-mortem coming either at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. Discussions will be continued in the forums. Zoom has upgraded its infrastructure, so this should be online in the next hour. Please try to spread this to as many stakeholders as possible. We will pick it up again on Thursday.  1:37:50  Rich: We need to have a discussion on flop auctions and timing for the Executive to go on Thursday. Please consider the urgency. MM: Is that the only thing going into this Executive?  R: This Executive can either be the flop auctions and SF\u2019s for Sai/Dai/USDC or ONLY the flop auctions to avoid mixing technical fixes and monetary policy. Or we can have a flop auction on Thursday\u2019s Executive, hope that it passes within 24 hours, and then have the monetary policy votes on Friday. MM: I think that the flop auctions temporary fix is important. We need to get this off our plate to see how the Dai peg is doing. Monetary stuff can wait, I would like to see the SCD DC go form 20 to 15 million. Can we do flop auctions first and revisit the other stuff in another executive? Rich: We\u2019ll get a forum thread with a poll asking how the community wants to handle this week\u2019s Executive. CN: We should be better about participating in the forums. Personally, if we could not start the flop auctions on the weekend, I would appreciate it. Kurt: From a technical perspective, because we can\u2019t expect executive decisions, we can put some technical logic for the auction to start at, say, 9 am on a weekday. CN: That would be awesome. It was a long weekend at 3 am on the West Coast. Kurt: Volunteered to make this forum thread.

We\u2019re joined by Niklas Kunkel from the foundation today. He\u2019s also in a transition role, like the interim Governance facilitator. His title is the Head of Oracles, and he is paving the way for future Oracle teams in the Maker Protocol. In these ephemeral roles/paths, we serve the community to get members on board, communicate, document process, and then hand off to the community. We\u2019ll discuss Nik\u2019s amazing presentation, jump into a forum recap, and listen to some market and risk analysis afterward.   Often, as we act, we find that initial momentum and decision making just continues. It\u2019s worthwhile to check ourselves. For example, migration has a beginning, middle, and end. As long as we level set and pay attention to where we are and what we should be doing, we\u2019re on track.   Give us feedback about the call.   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM this is where Governance happens, where consensus is measured, and how signal is generated. Let\u2019s start with the forum recap since Oracles will get complicated and have lots of questions.   Governance LongForWisdom Forum Recap 03:37   Should MKR governance get involved with Ethereum hard forks?   How to audit executive contract code?   Answered! In which @psychonaut asks how we are supposed to audit executive spell contract code.   Answer comment form Chris Mooney     Using tranches to insure against defaults of real-world assets and providing an extremely stable asset   In which @spin presents Drop as a potential token for inclusion as collateral in MCD. Explanation and QA video available on youtube.   Video Link to the presentation call     Seeking signal   Signal Request: Reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll   @hexonaut starts a signal thread regarding the voting cadence of the DSR spread vote. Most people seem to be in favor of some increase so far.    Signal Request: Add Ranked Choice Voting as an Option for Governance Polls   @hexonaut proposes adding the option for ranked-choice voting to the on-chain governance polling system. Some good discussion so far. This thread needs more eyes!    Signal Request: Should we reduce the minimum bid increase required for Surplus Auctions (FLAPs)?  The minimum was reduced with the EV that passed on Feb 21st, 2020.     Signal Request: What should the next ETH debt ceiling be?  In which @bit asks how much we should increase the MCD Debt Ceiling, or whether we should leave this parameter in the hands of the Interim Risk Team.    Questions and Discussion 4:23   Cyrus: As Mariano mentioned in the chat, we should discuss ETH forks. Do we want to support one chain over another? Do we have contingency plans where the community aligns on what happens next?   LongForWisdom: Agree, a contentious hard fork plan would be best.   Rich: Depends on where the community lands on that issue; hopefully, it inspires debate. Dapps, protocols, applications, dYdX, Compound, and all the other significant players in the space are new chess pieces on the puzzle board. It used to be that devs and miners would drive much of the discussions and debate. That dynamic has changed, it\u2019s going to be interesting to watch the collateral partners, community, and stakeholders get thrown in the mix choosing which fork is preferable.   Cyrus: Conceivably, Maker would support both, then Rich\u2019s job gets infinitely complex. That\u2019s 2 Dais and 2 Sais. Is there a reason we can\u2019t support both?   R: If the collateral gets split into two systems(one good one bad), Crypto collateral gets messy. But real-world collateral doesn\u2019t get divided into two systems. From a risk perspective, wouldn\u2019t leaving one be safest?   C: Yes! But not obvious or automatic.   David: Also, during a fork, there are technical considerations too. Oracles, liquidations, everyone would have double Dai balances, etc. Plus, in the new fork Dai may not equal $1, ETH pricing would be unclear for the first hour or two when it happens. It would be a mess.   R: I can\u2019t remember the last discussion, but you can\u2019t simply double the infrastructure.   Tim Black: You could make a framework, based on hash power to secure the chain, and stakeholders with value signaling towards one direction.   R: Huge can of worms, the old days of twice the collateral doesn\u2019t exist. Now we have interdependent pieces where it\u2019s much more intricate. Businesses depend on these chains and each other. No one is going to step in and fix it for us.   L: All the collateral stablecoins too, they\u2019ll have to pick one chain. They can\u2019t multiply their dollars by two.   CMooney: One thing from chat. There is a possible griefing attack. It\u2019s only going to take 50k MKR to shutdown the system on any fork. We could raise the threshold but then lose the game-theory mechanics of the ESM being there.     11:34   Richard Lopez: Trying to get a feel from other protocols. Are they looking at Maker for guidance? We can\u2019t expect exchanges to help. Are there projects that depend on Maker? And also, if they\u2019re dependent on Maker\u2019s influence, how to account for their needs?   RB: Even last year is a different world. It takes a village to make DeFi work, and now it\u2019s almost impossible to find the linchpins and prime movers.   D: At the moment, I haven\u2019t seen much signaling at all.   Mariano: We\u2019re going to have to think about this deeply.   R: Right, the number of people that need to align around a fork is going to be critical. It\u2019s impossible to predict and dangerous to speculate. Grassroots organization is required. Some sort of agnostic group working across organizations, protocols, stakeholders, and projects coordinating together. There is no one org to manage it, and the devs can\u2019t even do it anymore.     18:27 The conversation below is regarding the DSR Spread Cadence Thread   SamM: Overwhelmingly, the on-chain GP vote was no, so that\u2019s disappointing. In the forum thread, there were two votes: reducing to a month or two weeks. Those votes were stuck in a tie. Instead of multiple options, we launched the poll with the prospect that slightly won out. So now we have more questions instead of answers.   As a result, I started a new signal thread for ranked-choice voting. The ideal situation would have been to launch with three options and then pick your second and third. You\u2019d still get a winner out of the vote, rather than a no.   R: Ranked-choice voting thread surfaced another signal which, again, Sam, is fascinating.   S: Hoping to hear from Governance portal engineers, I wrote an implementation I think it would work. Poll ended, and people seem to want ranked choice if it\u2019s available. It would be great to get feedback.   CMooney: The technical idea seems sound.   R: Historically, we mention cadences, rates, and thresholds. Ranked-choice will be one of the first signals that would require development. With contract changes, we have to keep in mind significant pieces of complexity.   Sam: This is the first yes/no question that\u2019s failed. We don\u2019t have an easy way to find out why.   R: In the real world, there are more hidden actions, but we know why. Whereas in crypto we can see what happens but no idea why they did it. The question is how to circle back. If the portal had a place to say why that would be helpful.   Sam: That\u2019s exactly what I was proposing. A simple UI that pops up of, \u201cyou\u2019re saying no, why? Please feel to explain. Feedback on your vote is helpful.\u201d   T: My caveat is user friction. It\u2019s not much right now, but we still get complaints. I was hoping we could incentivize that signaling. On the surface, it\u2019s simple \u201cjust tell us why\u201d more profound than that there is a risk to doxxing yourself, etc.   R: I think the more significant friction is circling back at a later date to explain. While already logged in, a little pop up isn\u2019t that bad. E.G., \u201cWould you like to explain your vote for the benefit of the ecosystem?\u201d   L: Best to have for both sides.   R: It might be great to give people a voice, there would be utility there. Presumably, if they dissent. A comment box. Fascinating idea   D: That would solve the signal from MKR holders problem. An anonymous why tied to folks with skin in the game.   RL: One add-on, what\u2019s the takeaway in the feedback if it\u2019s a no. Is it just to know, or is it helpful to phrase the next vote.   S: it\u2019s precisely that. There was such a split between two weeks and a month. It\u2019s possible whales wanted two weeks.   L: This is a clear example of relaunching the vote. It adds to the majority consensus.   R: For votes like the GSM, this would have been incredibly useful.     Oracles Nik Kunkel Oracles and Governance Presentation Posted here. 33:26  1217\u00d7695 230 KB   743\u00d7421 110 KB    Oracles are data suppliers. They are frequently used to assess the price of an asset. They are used to determine the price of each collateral asset, how much a user is allowed to borrow, and which open positions are undercollateralized and need to be liquidated. This is highly necessary both for the Maker Protocol and for Defi   There are over a billion dollars in Defi, about 750 million of which is secured by our Oracles.   One consideration is which chain our oracles will support in the case of a fork. This would affect the entire ecosystem. Some users include Compound, dYdX, Set Protocol, ENS, Nosys, Polymath, and dozens of others.   38:30  826\u00d7462 115 KB   One of the key components of Oracles is feeds.   815\u00d7459 116 KB    Dark feeds increase the entropy of the \u2018coordination problem.\u2019 The coordination problem is the difficulty of coordinating an attack on multiple oracles at the same time. This becomes more difficult if they are anonymous.   Dark feeds are not Sybil-resistant: they can all be controlled by one person, and no one would know.    825\u00d7457 190 KB    Light feeds are easily targetable by government entities.   The ideal system is a hybrid model, one where there is a preservation of the security of the Dark feed but maintains the reputation-based trust of the light feeds.    814\u00d7522 116 KB   830\u00d7459 149 KB   Feeds collect price information from different exchanges and send that data to their own smart contract, on-chain, which triggers the Medianzer smart contract. Medianizer sorts and takes the median of all these price feeds. This is then used by the Maker protocol and third parties as a reference price.   748\u00d7414 81.5 KB   Oracles v2 was released alongside MCD. It addresses some of the problems of scalability, liability, and cost.   817\u00d7457 45.4 KB   From a computational/operational point of view, the Oracle v1 is wasteful as every feed needs to make an on-chain transaction with every update to the Medianizer.   836\u00d7576 217 KB    One major difference between Oracle V2 and Oracle V1 is that a lot of the process has been moved off-chain. Asset prices are signed using Ethereum keys. A peer-to-peer gossip network (called Scuttlebutt) takes in this information. It works similarly to viral propagation in social media.   Relayers are essentially keepers run by a third party. Think of them as the messenger boy. All they do is pick up a bunch of these signed messages from the Scuttlebutt network and submit them all at once to the Medianzer, as part of one transaction. This increases scalability dramatically and reduces costs dramatically while making the network more resilient.   Rather than submitting multiple transactions, which limited Oracle updates if there weren\u2019t enough transactions, we can submit a single transaction. This helps update the Oracle prices more efficiently during heavy congestion of the Ethereum network.   Before the Maker Protocol is affected by the Medianzer\u2019s price information, there is a one-hour delay set into the Oracle Security Module. This gives owners an hour to determine if they will be liquidated and gives an opportunity to put in more value in collateral or payback Dai to save their position.   Customers and partners can choose between taking the transaction information from the Medianizer or the Oracle Security Module. The latter is safer and more secure against governance attacks. But some partners may choose to read from the Medianizer to avoid the latency of the Oracle Security Module.    825\u00d7462 63.5 KB   827\u00d7460 107 KB   One of the biggest differences between Oracles v1 and v2 is: V1 was open access. This led to a flourishing of the DeFi community. However, Oracle v2 will have a whitelist, which we will discuss later in the presentation.   821\u00d7450 112 KB   819\u00d7459 63.9 KB   686\u00d7527 200 KB   Oracles need to be a self-sustaining system with incentives to be run in a decentralized manner. Currently, Maker runs feeds that contribute to 75% of DeFi\u2019s value.   827\u00d7583 204 KB   Governance has a responsibility for the users of the Oracles in both V2 and V1. We shouldn\u2019t extort people with the advent of Oracles V2. Hence they will run in parallel until at least until the SCD shutdown. Afterward, any organization will be able to get access to any Oracle for free for one year as part of the Responsible Oracle Migration proposal that was ratified before the new year.   820\u00d7448 107 KB   822\u00d7453 102 KB  Oracles Questions and Comments 46:30   R: Isn\u2019t there a risk relying on an active network graph for data propagation. How can you insure or maintain the health of the Scuttlebutt network?  N: Define enough, feeds have to publish data; if they don\u2019t, then it is equivalent to a censorship attack. When you\u2019re making an attack that denies quorum, you would probably attempt manipulating the price rather than censoring the price. It\u2019s much more profitable from the feed, in my opinion.    Vishesh: Who comprises the Scuttlebutt network?  N: All of the feeds and all of the relayers. We\u2019ll discuss relayers shortly.    57:16   Rich: Are there SLA\u2019s and monitoring? How are these feeds audited? What are the safeguards put into place for Oracle behavior?   N: Despite close monitoring, we should work toward a transparency system for people to audit the performance of the feeds in real-time.   R: Is there a dashboard or a real-time graph for this?   N: There\u2019s nothing externally facing. It\u2019s on the backlog of our tasks. When we finish higher priority items; that\u2019s next on the list.   R: There might be an opportunity for community members to step up and work on this.     Oracle Related Unanswered Questions These are questions in the call\u2019s chat that were left unanswered due to the time-constraint of the call.   But if relayers are not also feeds, they are not verifying the data, so how are they deciding what price to retweet?   How are relayers incentivized? They also paid by the feed stipend?   Will there eventually be an easier UI for this rather than using the current Gov poll/Exec vote structure?   Does the defi light feed proposal set a criterion for the addition of future feeds, or will they be voted in ad hoc?   Risk Vishesh Relevant links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs The State of the Pegs 1:12:19  1057\u00d7508 93.4 KB    Large quantities of Dai trading in the last 24 hours, about 36 million Dai. Previously 24 hours traded at about 38 million Dai (overlapping windows). Dai trading slightly above peg. May need to redefine \u2018slightly\u2019 as Dai has been trading tighter to peg recently.   A lot of this volume is Oasis and dYdX, some more recently on Coinbase as well - trending toward higher volumes.     The last 24 hours were interspersed, with a few trades running above and a few below.    Over the 7-day timescale, pretty heavy volumes trading due to ETH craziness. Usually, the crazier ETH is, the more active DAI is. This makes sense as a lot of the use case for DAI is leveraged on ETH.   1047\u00d7454 110 KB   dYdX and Oasis accounting for a large share of trading volume over the last week, total Dai traded at 101.053 million Dai. Much of the trades were on-peg or slightly below. This likely corresponds to the purchasing of Dai as people try to deleverage or pay down debt.    Overall, the total Dai supply from ETH has stayed more or less steady, coming down slightly at ~114 Million Dai. The BAT amount came up a bit, now at 1.7 million Dai; this is interesting because it usually never moves.   1057\u00d7519 162 KB    The top three positions currently account for 25% of the supply. Top 15 positions account for roughly half of the supply. Average collateralization on a weighted basis is about 330%. The top 5 positions drop down to about 280% and the top 3% drop to 275%.   Some of these few largest positions are somewhat low in the amount of collateral. These are risks to be aware of; if these top positions get liquidated, there will be a large quantity of Dai being sold, and there will be a subsequent impact on DAI price.     DAI supply growth has ticked down a little bit, same with SAI supply decline asymptotically leveling off.   901\u00d7491 72.8 KB   With the total amount of trading activity, DAI liquidity has come up a little bit. The volume on Uniswap has come up a bit, but Uniswap hasn\u2019t been a huge participant in this effect.   758\u00d7521 91.6 KB   MKR liquidity hasn\u2019t moved since then. MKR that was previously removed has not been placed back on Uniswap.   998\u00d7504 278 KB   Fair amount of auctions in the last 24-48 hours as seen on Daiauctions.com   Risk Questions and Discussion 1:14:50   R: Do we know why dYdX is represented so prominently?  V: Yes, there is a lot of discussion on this. A lot of people are discussing potential liquidation of riskier margin positions. Also, I think, in general, dYdX tends to be the platform of choice for higher risk, higher yield, short-term trades. We\u2019ve learned that Maker is nestled into this longer-term position, where Compound is usually where people refinance when rates are better.    Primoz Migration Analysis 1:19:18  650\u00d7505 76.2 KB   Increase of SAI in the migration contract in the last couple of days. SAI supply hasn\u2019t really increased, which tells us that SAI holders are migrating.   1050\u00d7528 179 KB   Red bars indicate SAI supply over the last month. It dropped down to 2 Million and just a few days ago reached 5 Million SAI. This is the second-highest inventory we\u2019ve seen since the migration started. In mid-January, it reached an all-time-high but was quickly drained down because of migrations. Currently, we haven\u2019t seen much drainage, which means SCD CDP\u2019s are not using that inventory or are not in such a rush to repay their debts as they were in earlier stages of the migration.   1056\u00d7528 173 KB   SAI to DAI has not seen much increase except for on the last day, where a larger inflow of SAI in the migration contract can be seen. In the last month, about 300,000 SAI has been migrated daily to be converted into DAI.     In the last month, about 13 Million SAI has been converted into DAI. 10 Million SAI is accounted for in migration changes. The remaining 3 Million Sai has been accumulated through a reverse migration. By this process, people are minting DAI, converting it to SAI through the migration contract, and then using it for various reasons (providing liquidity, bidding on a premium once liquidations happened, etc.).   6.3 Million SCD CDP\u2019s have been repaid. This is higher than the SAI supply drop because we have also had an additional 1 million SAI minting in this month.  300,000 SAI came from new CDP\u2019s in that period, and around 700,00 SAI was minted from old CDP\u2019s.    300 CDP\u2019s did repayment, about 200 migrated directly. 457,000 in outstanding fees were collected, about 600,000 in fees, which is high in value when compared to MCD net fees adjusted for DSR. About 1.3 Million in fees are left for the period before the migration started. 20% of outstanding fees were paid in one month, which is not a low figure at all.   Most of the repayment was made by the larger CDP\u2019s. The eight largest CDP\u2019s repaid 350,000 in this month. Most of these repayments have been made at the beginning of the month.     A small number of smaller CDP\u2019s repaid using the migration tool. Only 2-3 CDP\u2019s migrating per day.   876\u00d7457 192 KB    54.89% of SCD CDP\u2019s are still inactive, as compared to one month ago. This represents 1.3 million in fees. The active SCD CDP\u2019s still owe about 9 million in debt and about 600,000 in fees.   SAI minting corresponds to general debt repayment in all groups in the active group except for those with wipe activities, which are more aggressive and clearly want to repay their debt.    550\u00d7518 104 KB   Larger DAI CDP\u2019s hold most of the debt and fees. Most have been inactive for about three months.   582\u00d7523 98.2 KB   Sai held in the migration contract represents a quarter of all supply. Not as many large Sai holders, the second largest is Compound, which holds about 1.1 million Sai. Uniswap and Karbo hold about 0.5 million in Sai.   1031\u00d7481 239 KB   The share of active wallets is dropping, which means the share of inactive wallets is rising. Wallets that are inactive for more than six months represent more than 12 million Sai. This is the same number that the CDP borrows owe in inactive wallets, and maybe the lower bound for debt owed.  Insights  Migration looked great in the last month, but this last week saw a great slow down. This should be something to monitor.  Migration Questions and Discussion 1:31:14   Vishesh: Do you have a comparison between Draws and Wipes in Sai compared to Dai. You can see an asymptotic curve in Sai supply, leveling off at $20 million. Is this an actual trend, or due to exogenous price effects due to ETH? Is this a temporary slow down or leveling off.   Primoz: It\u2019s hard to say, but I think it\u2019s leveling off. CDP\u2019s are, in general, inactive, so I don\u2019t believe it has to do with ETH. The situation is either forgotten wallets or people waiting and hoping for a better outcome.   V: That\u2019s why I was benchmarking Dai vs. Sai. Dai was growing, Sai was shrinking, but both Dai growth and Sai decrease slowed down this week. I\u2019m interested to know whether this slow down is temporary or beginning to level off. It has to level off at some point, whether this happens now at $20 million Sai or at $12 million Sai is unknown.   P: There isn\u2019t much leverage in SCD anymore, and they are well protected. They don\u2019t have to make numerous repayments. It\u2019s hard to say.   V: I\u2019m looking a bit further than a month, back to when migration kicked off. E.g., Dai has a linear growth trend, and Sai has a shrinking growth trend. Recently, Sai\u2019s shrinking has become logarithmic, and Dai has leveled off.

In keeping with the trend that we have been seeing over the last few weeks we have a furious level of activity going on in the Governance Community, and that\u2019s translated into a pile of things that we need to go over on this call. So the agenda is diverse and large. I\u2019m going to keep my section to a minimum.   Charles St. Louis will give us a review of MIP 3. It\u2019s a MIP that goes into the governance cycle and will look like in the future. So it helps the ecosystem to internalize some of the process that they have brought to the table for us.   LongForWisdom will give us his \u201cGovernance at a Glance\u201d segment.   Will Barns is back and better than even. He\u2019s going to review the GSM and the Dark Fix. Those were very important discussion back in the olden days before everything changed, but they\u2019re still important now and it\u2019s time to revisit these legacy topics which is another topic that I have been beating the drum on for the last couple of weeks that we can\u2019t lose all threads. So he will talk about the Dark Fix and also review what solutions need to be moved to the social layer and what the social layer looks like.   Mariano Conti is here to talk about SCD shutdown and giving us a bit of a hat here. Actually that ties into what I want to talk about today too. SCD shutdown is not a matter of pressing a button, it\u2019s complicated.   MakerMan is here and will give us a recap of the work that he\u2019s picked up. Super exciting to see him jump in and pick up a task: zero-bid vault auctions and how to model that data.   Cyrus is going to give us a heads up on the new series of risk calls we have next week.   Vishesh will talk to us about the state of the peg.   Huge agenda, not a lot of time to go over it, so I\u2019m going to do my segment very quickly and then we can move on. I only have one thought, the thought of the day. 04:47   We have lots and lots of things that are happening at once, the community is self organizing in ways that I could only have dreamed were possible 6 or 12 months ago. Super happy about that. The community as a whole is taking care of its own destiny and that\u2019s what the DAO is all about and what people has been working towards. As that autonomy increases we\u2019re going to run into some more growing pains. That\u2019s what Governance is, a never-ending series of growing pains, improvements, and iterations. We have been growing, iterating and improving all this time, so obviously I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem, but here are some examples of things that have been happening in the community just very recently, that have been brought to a vote: -SCD shutdown   0-Bid Vault compensation   Adding a new type of voting, Ranked choice Voting, that presumably and hopefully will be better able to capture signaling in the ecosystem.     All these things are very healthy and very cool. Here is the \u201cbut\u201d, there are constraints that we all operate under. The question becomes what is possible in timelines allocated to us in light of all the other things. So what I want to talk about is how we handle coordination when polls go through or get proposed. There is a large number of moving pieces involved with the ecosystem. Piles of stakeholder, piles of process, piles of actors\u2019 inputs inside the Foundation, inside the DAO, inside the crypto space, or the DeFi space in general. So I want us to start thinking about coordination of tasks, determining feasibility, making sure that stakeholders have been brought into the conversations. Because we\u2019re running into situations where the majority of the community signals their intent to move in a certain direction or have something happen, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s what governance is all about, but, intent doesn\u2019t equal implementation necessarily.   Let me give you some examples. The SCD shutdown is a good one. The community came up with the desire to shut down SCD. They did some research and figured that April 24th is a good day to do it. I do not dispute that. But we\u2019re going to see very soon that there are things that might literally be impossible to do. We\u2019re going to have timing constraints, resource constraints, just pure mechanical constraints. There\u2019s occasionally an array of things that the smart contracts team simply cannot do. Or we\u2019re going to require iterations of smart contracts, which imply additional auditing, or testing, and developers that need to be found and reallocated so, there\u2019s  implementation details that may impact timelines.   I will ask the community that when we start coming up with these polls in the forums that we do a better job at feasibility study and identifying the stakeholders that are required to make this thing happen. To ensure that the thing that people want to have happen is possible in the desired timing.   As always, discussions happen in the Forum.   Questions and Comments 1 03:03   Cyrus: Quick notice: a few weeks ago we were doing risk presentations on some tooling that we wanted to walk through with Governance. Obviously that got sidetracked a bit, so we wanted to resume that work next week. We wanted to do it on consecutive days, so we\u2019re going to be holding additional Governance calls next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Timing will probably be one hour after the current timing of the Governance calls. I\u2019ll put a public notice, but we wanted to give a heads up that we will be doing additional risk calls next week.  Rich Brown: Yes, this is probably something that we will see in the future, so we\u2019re reaching density on what can be achieved on these calls. A variety of topics need to be addressed. We had these chats a long time ago, whether we should have 4 or 5 different calls during the course of the week. It was my opinion that it\u2019s better to wait to reach density before we start splitting up into separate corners to do other stuff. We\u2019re rapidly approaching that state. Cyrus\u2019s team has been doing a fantastic amount of work. Piles and piles to go over and there\u2019s just no chance that we can take care of it in these calls, so next week is Risk Week.    Maker Improvement Proposals Charles St. Louis MIP 3 Governance Cycle 09:25 MIP3 Thread Link   Hey everyone, before I get started walking through MIP 3, I would like to give a brief overview of what\u2019s going on in the world of MIPs in relation to Governace. Recently we launched a couple of blog posts detailing the self-sustaining MakerDAO initiative. One of those key pillars is the proposals that are created through the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework. On Monday we proposed the initial 13 MIPs that we feel are necessary to create long-term governance and self-sustainability of the protocol. So as of this week, there\u2019s been a lot of constructive feedback and positive feedback from a lot of the community members. I do encourage anyone here who hasn\u2019t taken a look yet to dig into them or at least read them if you have the time.   In terms of the actual MIPs, or the phase of this whole thing which we\u2019ll get into later, the current MIPs are under review during this time period. This means that MIP authors work with community members on integrating feedback into the MIPs. This is to try to cover all the bases and any gaps that are there, or any wording that needs to be clearer. This period will last until April 27th, after which there will be something called the Timing Poll, which is a special Governance Poll that gives the community a chance to decide if they want to proceed with a ratification vote so that the MIPs will be formally adopted, or to delay the ratification vote for one month and institute a period of time for competing proposals to be proposed by the community.   If the community does indeed decide to proceed with this ratification vote, it will occur over the period of May 1st to 4th. If the vote passes, the first governance cycle, defined in MIP3 will begin on May 4th.   There will be some references to MIP0 during this walk-through. I do urge anyone to try and read through that. I know it\u2019s quite long, but it does help clarify everything that\u2019s going on in the world of MIPs.   12:08  975\u00d7617 178 KB    MIP3 is a proposal to create this new governance cycle. This new formal governance cycle has the goal of being a predictable framework for MKR holders and the community to make decisions. And to make these decisions transparent. It is very focused on a certain time period. It\u2019s a monthly governance cycle. The MIP itself has two main components:   MIP3c1 The Governance Cycle Breakdown: A week-by-week breakdown over the course of the 4-weeks of a given month.   MIP3c2 The Default Inclusion Threshold. Initially proposed to be set at 3,000 MKR. I\u2019ll get into more about what the purpose of that this. There is debate about it on the forums.      1040\u00d7680 224 KB    The first component of this MIP  is the Governance Cycle Breakdown.   Each monthly Governance Cycle begins on the 1st Monday of the month, with Maker Improvement Proposals being submitted by this time.   Those MIPs will be considered for inclusion at the end of the month, during the executive vote.   The governance cycle ends with the executive vote that would begin on the 4th Monday of said month. After the executive vote occurs there will be a period of time for review, so a meeting like this, where you can talk about the retroactive aspects of the month and also plan for the next month ahead.   The time is based on UTC, we thought that we had to make that clear.   First week of the governance cycle is when the actual MIP themselves are formally submitted into the governance cycle.   Formal submission is the 5th step in a MIPs life cycle.   Long before that there is the conception phase, where the idea is born on forums or twitter.   Next is when the actual proposal is submitted to the discourse forum, where it needs to comply with the actual components and criterion in the MIP template itself.   The MIP editor will check that it fits all the standards. After that it enters a formal Request-For-Comments period. In this case, it is exactly what\u2019s happening now, where the community and MIP authors work together to iterate on the actual content and format of the MIPs to achieve the broadest consensus from everyone in the ecosystem.     During the RFC phase there are a couple of things that are important to note: there\u2019s something called the feedback period and the frozen period.   Feedback period is the minimum amount of time that the community has to review a specific MIP   Frozen period is when everything is set in stone and there are no more changes that can be made and it\u2019s awaiting to be formally submitted.     At that period in time, when those criteria have been met, it officially enters the formal submission phase, which is what is happening on the 1st Monday-Wednesday of this month. So the forum submission is done basically by submitting it to the discourse forum as well as GitHub and then it can be iterated on.   During the first Thursday of that month the actual Inclusion Poll review meeting happens; the community comes together and discusses which proposals are in accordance with the guidelines as well as well as which ones may be appealing to the community.   17:02  984\u00d7723 348 KB    Week 2, on Monday, is when the Governance Facilitator pushes this Inclusion Poll.   The proposals that the Governance Facilitator have gauged general consensus on are included. Week two relies heavily on the Governance Facilitator working with the community to figure which ones are the best ones to get included.   As I mentioned before, there is something called the Default Inclusion Threshold. It\u2019s a variable amount of MKR that can be changed with the sub-proposals that are defined later on. This threshold is a value that is automatically counted towards the no vote tally of the Inclusion Poll itself. The Default Inclusion Threshold is changed with these proposals if the community feels like the current value isn\u2019t fair. I do know that the value is not set in this MIP itself, but I do have to make that change and be upfront that I did not include it. My proposal will be 3,000 MKR.   During an Inclusion Poll the community comes together to vote yes or no on whether to include this proposal in a Ratification Vote. If the yes votes for a given proposal are higher than the combination of no votes plus the default inclusion threshold (3000 MKR), the poll passes.     At the second Thursday of the month the Governance Poll Review occurs. This is much like the current Governance Polls, where general risk and governance topics are discussed at hand without any MIP decision making occurring.   18:54  1053\u00d7659 356 KB    Next is week three. In the 3rd Monday- Wednesday of the month:   The governance poll will officially be submitted by this governance facilitator.   The poll will run for the duration of Monday until Wednesday.   The poll is also a yes/no MKR poll that accepts or rejects the combination of all the MIPs that have passed the inclusion stage.     On the 3rd Thursday of the month, the governance community comes together and decides on reviewing the executive vote options. So it\u2019s a public meeting that will focus on either future proposals or any controversies surrounding the current Governance Poll and future upcoming Executive Vote with relation to those MIPs.  In case there are too many no votes in the governance poll, and there is evidence that there is an effort to silence legitimate concerns in the community this meeting provides opportunities for compromise and the community and governance facilitators must consider whether it is creating a risk of governance split. If a Governance Facilitator believes that the proposed executive vote will result in a governance split, the Governance Facilitator should not deploy the executive vote and must instead work with the community to resolve the problem. Thus, in the future when there are multiple governance facilitators,if all of them are in consensus that the executive vote creates a significant risk of a community split, the executive vote will not happen and the MIPs that were supposed to be up for an executive vote, instead have their status changed to deferred.     1146\u00d7601 343 KB  20:39   The last week of the governance cycle is week 4, and during that Monday the executive vote is  submitted if the governance poll has passed, and the no-votes are not too high to deem a threat to consensus. This regular executive that will be proposed will last for 7 days, meaning it will be in effect after those 7 days.  If the executive vote passes, there is a Retro and Planning Meeting. It is a retroactive assessment of what happened during that month and some time can be allotted for next month planning to be proactive. You can think about the poll outcomes, what can be optimized, what changes can be made, sub-proposals for the actual default inclusion threshold modifications, and so on.    21:54  925\u00d7314 82.6 KB    This is an overview of MIP life cycle.   The governance life cycle begins with proposal submissions.   Then it is discussed whether to include them into this inclusion poll.   The inclusion poll happens.   The Goverance poll review meeting then happens.   The Governance poll occurs.   Then the meeting to review the executive vote occurs.   And lastly, the executive vote either accepts or rejects the MIP(s).      1012\u00d7772 226 KB    The second component of MIP 3 is the Default Inclusion Threshold Modification Subproposals. This threshold is crucial to the poll and is proposed to be set at 3,000 MKR, but can be discussed. It\u2019s probably the biggest thing that we want feedback on at this point.   In this component there\u2019s a default period of 3 months, so when somebody submits the change for the default inclusion threshold it will last for a default feedback period of 3 months and has a frozen period of 1 month. These periods can overlap and are based on the MIP author\u2019s decision on whether the frozen period can start before or after the default feedback period.  Basically we just provide these templates for making those proposals to change the default proposal inclusion threshold, which includes the number of the subproposal, the author, the date proposed, and then the specification section is the summary. So it\u2019s a proposal to modify this threshold to x value, what\u2019s the reason behind it, and what is the exact value.    That is a lot of me talking and I\u2019m sure there are some questions, but that is an overview of what MIP 3 looks like and I do encourage everyone to ask questions, I\u2019m not sure if we have much time on this call, but please go into the forum or in the Rocket.Chat channel, and fire off all the questions you have, or feedback or any additions that you may think are necessary.   Questions and Comments 2 24:12  Rich Brown: I\u2019m not seeing questions in the chat but I want to echo that this is going to be one of the first MIPs that we put into practice on a regular basis so if people have questions or comments, the forum is the place to voice them.  24:30   Makerman: Why are thresholds a fixed amount of MKR? Why are they not a percentage of the outstanding MKR?   Charles St. Louis: Not sure I have an answer to that, but that is a good suggestion that you could provide on the MIP itself. It\u2019s kind of a bigger question in general. Do you have a preference?   MakerMan: It\u2019s kind of common sense. If you burn MKR, say half the Maker, the thresholds change. It begs the question: what\u2019s the point of having threshold on things to accomplish actions? And if we\u2019re going to have a threshold, why is it not related to the outstanding versus a fixed number that will be a percent that changes relative to the outstanding.   Rich: The threshold is one of the trickiest things you can do when you\u2019re coming up with a system, particularly one that has algorithmic aspects and human aspects as well. I\u2019m sure the MIP architects will be completely open to a more refined approach.

                    "content": "Social Layer Solutions Wil Barnes GSM and Dark Spells 31:29 In Februry we actually started this discussion about what to do if we have a critical bug, and then it was pretty much usurped by the events of March. The purpose of this discussion is to revisit two topics that we need to start thinking about.  1729\u00d7860 106 KB    First is the GSM, which was, during the downturn, changed to 4 hours. I\u2019d like to think about what we should do in the future with the GSM, taking into account the experience we\u2019ve got in March.   And secondly, to discuss the dark spell social layer, which is still very much up in the air. We proposed three methods back in February, but I\u2019d like to discuss them again. And then I\u2019d like to formalize this discussion into a document, so if we ever need to use it, at least in the short-term before it\u2019s formalized into a MIP, we know what to do.    32:53951\u00d7511 67.7 KB    I\u2019ll first just discuss the GSM delay. I\u2019ll discuss these slides, then I\u2019ll walk through the dark spell slides, and then we can have a short discussion just to make sure that we get through it.   The GSM delay is currently 4h. We ended up in this state in mid March, I think it was the 13th or the 14th, I can\u2019t remember the exact date. It prompts the discussion of what do we feel the optimal GSM delay is and how do we get there. Do we want to turn directly to 24h? Is 24h the right amount of time? I want to have that discussion and get feedback from the community on how to handle that.    33:45932\u00d7450 53.7 KB    And also understanding the precedent. We moved the delay to 4h. I want to understand whether 4h is the right amount of time? What do people think of that move? What\u2019s new about future situations?   And also, DEFCON spells: Chris Mooney has developed the spells that are purpose-built for the situations of adverse conditions. Chris, if you want to have a talk about how that can actually fit into that, let\u2019s do it later.    1727\u00d7874 92.7 KB   Moving quickly, the Dark Spell Social Layer is something we need to find consensus on soon.   34:18966\u00d7479 77.1 KB    I won\u2019t actually discuss what the dark spell is, beyond that it provides us a way to patch a bug without exposing the bytecode on-chain.   For me, hiding the bytecode is the reason this is important. Because, first of all, someone can reverse engineer the code that\u2019s sitting on-chain before a bug fix is applied if we go through a regular executive vote.   The code implementation is ready, but we need to actually understand the social layer, how we\u2019re going to handle that, and then understand how Emergency Shutdown is an option.    34:50945\u00d7455 91.1 KB    A critical bug, and I\u2019ll be very general about this, is a very big bug, where at least 10% of the value of collateral tokens in the system are affected. It must not be theoretical, and must be operational, which is where we are right now with MCD.   Non-critical bugs will still surface due to existing governance channels. Like Kurt discussed recently with the blocked debt auction bug, things like that will not be patched with a dark spell, it\u2019s just necessary. I think it better serves to discuss them in public and then pass a solution through a normal vote.    35:50960\u00d7473 63.4 KB   It\u2019s important the dark spell is used only in exceptional circumstances, for critical bugs. A Dark Fix is designed to obscure as much information as possible. Given this, it\u2019s the purpose of the social layer that we have a clear but narrow mandate to cast this thing, so it should be really only focused on fixing a critical bug that would be severely damaging across the board.   36:25964\u00d7490 36.5 KB    Back in February we proposed these three models:   the Major MKR Holders Model   the Independent Auditor Attestation Model   the Community Appointed Trusted Party Model.      36:40958\u00d7474 124 KB    I really just want to go through these three slides, just discuss them again, because I think that these are going to be where we\u2019re going to frame the discussion and I\u2019d like to get community\u2019s signal which one they think is best fitting for MCD, and then also we can tweak these and discuss implementation details in the forums.   The Major MKR holders Model is just a pre-selected committee of MKR holders. The dev team, current or EPC, will interact directly with this committee when a bug is discovered to coordinate the fix. The MKR holders will sign the transaction governing support for this solution, and then the dark spell will be used to patch the bug.   Some of the advantages: the number of people that acknowledge the bug is kept to a minimum. But then, there are some disadvantages to that: high trust that the dev team and MKR holder do the right thing. Maybe then MKR holders don\u2019t feel comfortable attesting to the fix or don\u2019t possess the technical acumen. Bugs can be quite complicated in the system and there is just various potential conflicts of interest.   The implementation details, I\u2019d like to discuss in greater detail in the forums. There we can really discuss the fine print and how this is actually handled, how may members are in the committee, when to select a new committee, how to communicate with large MKR holders when a bug is discovered, etc. These are just various things we need to discuss given this model.      38:27972\u00d7481 159 KB    The second model is the Independent Auditor Attestation Model, so an independent auditor or an agreement with an independent auditor is in place. When a bug is discovered, we interact directly with the auditor. They attest to the validity of that vulnerability, sign-off on it, ensure that the fix fixes what needs to be fixed. Then, we use the dark spell.   Similar to the previous model, a number of people with knowledge of this bug is kept quite minimum. It also introduces advantage where the community input on how this auditor is selected; it\u2019s not just large MKR holders influencing the decision.   Disadvantages are along the same lines: it\u2019s quite centralized, but there is governance oversight. There is a cost associated with having an agreement in place. I don\u2019t really know the specifics, but the cost is to provide a certain level of service response time, things like that.   Again, regarding implementation details, I would like the community to weight in on the relationship with the IA, what we want for the auditor, how to select them, etc. There is criteria and there is also some more flexibility to design a process here. For example, we can have an existing set of independent auditors, but then, when a bug is discovered, the community can chose a second to sort of validate alongside the existing list of our auditor as a means to prevent bribery or just act like a check.      40:23980\u00d7496 132 KB    And the third is Community Appointed Trusted Party Model, which is a little different. It\u2019s a bit more reactionary in nature. When a bug is discovered, the community is informed as best as they can without revealing technical details of the bug. The community drives the passing of the bug-fix, that goes like that appointed trusted party model, to attest to it. Then, once the agreement is there that the community-appointend trusted party feels that this is a vulnerability that needs to be patched and is critical, then the dark spell would be used.  This could take longer than normal, you could get mired in some debate on what to do and then the bug is just existing, so there is some things to consider with this model as well.     1729\u00d7879 168 KB    Those are the three models. We are not necessarily confined to just one. If there are things we like about others, we can have introduced another model as a backstop.   The goal is to understand the community\u2019s preferred solution, which I\u2019d like to do through discussion on the forums, and then once we have the idea of the model, that is, I\u2019d say, the most salient, we can iterate and further optimize that solution and try to document and create a policy around it. So we have a process to follow should a bug be discovered.    42:05958\u00d7526 57.7 KB    This is the last slide here. I\u2019d like to begin discussion on these methods. I would like to understand what the community thinks of these, what they do and don\u2019t like, and we can start assembling this document, putting there things that community feels are most important and on the medium to long-term actually formalize this in a MIP.   I don\u2019t see this happening in the short-term, this is something we need to think about on medium to long-term. Those are the two points I\u2019d like to discuss, but I also want to be cognizant of the folks behind me.   Questions and Comments 4 35:10   Rich: Where this criteria for defining critical bugs come from? Is this just on the fly, or an industry standard?  Will: This is from our HackerOne bug bounty page, what defines a critical bug.    43:01   Rich: There are mostly just comments in the side bar, but one of the things I wanted to clarify: you said that this is important in the medium to long-term, you mean the formalizing of a plan into a MIP? or you mean addressing the entire issue of dark fixes?   Will: I see the MIP situation more like a tertiary thing, we do need to do that, but first we need to find the method in which we\u2019re going to handle bug-fix to have a policy in place. The MIP is important, but until we get there we need to make sure we all have consensus on how a bug will be handled.   Rich: I agree, it\u2019s always extremely difficult to try and figure out how important something is, what the sense of urgency is on an unknown. But particularly, as the community begins to accelerate, we see things like \u201clet\u2019s do emergency shut down\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s do zero-bid auction compensation\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s do the ranked choice\u201d - that means that new code is coming into the system, and traditionally the foundation releases code once a year at most. And only after it\u2019s been audited three of four different times; the process is potentially going to change as we accelerate in the future, so it feels to me like this is something that needs to be cleared up sooner rather than later.   Will: Agreed, I think it\u2019s better we have at least a document, even if it\u2019s not formal yet, that we can act on if something happens.   Rich: Alright, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your posts, so thanks for volunteering, it\u2019s going to be a big lift, so it\u2019s great you\u2019re stepping up to do that.     Emergency Shutdown Mariano Conti Single-Collateral DAI Emergency Shutdown 45:02   I\u2019ll try to be brief: there are still ~$3.5 million Sai in the migration contract.   Last week\u2019s executive was supposed to shut down the bridge from SAI to DAI; it still hasn\u2019t passed(passed shortly after this call) and we\u2019re going to have a new executive tomorrow, two weeks away from the proposed date to shut down SCD. I just want to let the community know that if SCD is shut down and there is still Sai as collateral in the MCD system, this can potentially create unintended consequences.   Single Collateral DAI shutdown means that token is no longer a stablecoin. Sai becomes a claim on an amount of ETH at the price that the system was shutdown at. But as the migration contract is a special contract, it does treat SAI as one-to-one to DAI, and if we still have a large amount of SAI in the system after shutdown, then we are very dependent on what happens with the price of ETH, and SAI becomes a less than ideal collateral to have. Because if, hopefully, the price of ETH goes up, then there is going to be keepers that are going to be incentivized to grab all of that remaining SAI from the contract(by converting Dai to Sai.) But, if the price of ETH starts going down, then we no longer respect the system in saying that DAI is properly backed, right? Because Sai is going to be worth less and we would have to find ways to remove this collateral because nobody is going to be incentivized to do so.   And in the end, if we keep it long enough, then our governance may even need to pass a spell that says that we\u2019re going to generate DAI out of the system, so that the governance itself removes this SAI from the migration contract and sells it in the open market. If we incur a loss, then we\u2019re going to have more debt auctions and so on and so forth. That\u2019s not the only way to do it, but it\u2019s one way to do it.     I just want to put it forth to the community that it is very important, at least on an engineering and economic level, that the contract is drained of funds before we do the shutdown.   Questions and Comments 5 48:02   Rich Brown: Thanks for that Mariano. I think this pleasantly ties in to what I was talking about at the beginning of the call, where community can signal intention, a poll can get presented, but there are orders of operations. There is mechanical, there is legal, there is regulatory, there is smart contract, there is resourcing, there are all kinds of issues that have to align in the right order to make sure that these things are successful, and this sounds like one of them. I might have drifted and maybe I missed the point, I hope not, so what do you think the solution is? Is that a sort of a call to arms, like \u201chey, get out there and vote\u201d or wait for the next time this thing comes around, which will, presumably, be on Monday?   Mariano: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my place as a Foundation employee still to say anything. I think it\u2019s more of just saying what I think is going on with the system and people will make their own decisions. One thing we may have done wrong is packing that particular spell mixed with some other risk parameters.   Maybe people did want to shut down the migration contract, but they didn\u2019t want to reduce the SF in USDC from 16 to 12, I don\u2019t know. It could be that this warrants its own executive spell, maybe we can move this to the forums as well. Maybe by some miracle we will get 3088 to migrate, which is the last big CDP in SCD. I don\u2019t really have a solution how to do this, I just want to stress the fact that the migration contract should be drained before shutdown. And I can provide a couple of different solutions, but the one that has been provided so far is voting on stopping the SAI to DAI bridge. This only stops drawing DAI with SAI, it doesn\u2019t stop CDPs from migrating and it doesn\u2019t stop the bridge the other way, so going back from DAI to SAI would still be possible.   Rich: Alright, thanks Mariano. I was trying to lure you into making a proclamation, but you dodged.     50:41   Rich: You\u2019re also getting a bunch of other hot topics, hot issues for me. One of those is obviously the bundling issue. As the complexity of the ecosystem and number of proposals increase, as the engagement from the community accelerates, we\u2019re going to have more and more potentially disparate or contentious or not complementary proposals. At some point, we really need to address this issue head on. How do we handle a significant number of decisions on a weekly basis without turning these into all or nothing types of operations. But, let\u2019s leave it there, because I\u2019m unwilling to present strong opinions and no answers, so let\u2019s leave it to the community.   Scottrepreneur: it seems like a more realistic goal is to try and have the migration contract empty by the 24th, and then the bigger goal is to be ready to shut down SCD.   Rich: that feels like a bit of a non sequitur, but I think that\u2019s generally the idea. One of the things that I want, and I\u2019m going to put the spotlight on Mariano again next week, or Derek, I\u2019m going to push somebody under the bus here, there are a significant number of things that need to happen in a specific order for shutdown to occur. There is no big red button that we can break the glass and that\u2019s the end of SCD. Well, maybe there is, but that might be disastrous.   Rich: There is risk that needs to be involved with some decisions and at least modelling out some options here, smart contracts teams need to have things in place, potentially ecosystem actors need to be onboard so that the integration teams are able to reach out to people; there are stakeholders in the community, there are large CDP owners that potentially should be involved in this process too. There is a communication aspect; It needs to be broadcast to the crypto DeFi ecosystem that this thing is going away, so be prepared. So, there are all kind of things that need to happen. We picked the date, that was the easiest part, and now we need to figure out how, who, and when. Well, we\u2019ve got the when, but anyways, it\u2019s not as simple, so we need to start thinking about identifying stakeholders and figuring out what feasibility looks like. Hopefully we can dig through it in depth again next week, as the date is getting dangerously close.     Rich: Alright, so, thank you Mariano. You have some projects, we have our project on the go, but let\u2019s talk about one of them. Can you give us a brief overview on what\u2019s going on with the Zero bid model you\u2019ve been working on?   Vault Holder Compensation MakerMan Zero bid auction data modeling 54:13   Simple upshot: we know we had Zero bid auctions and one thing in my head is using actual scenario and risk analysis using the real liquidation data.   It begged another question: once you have the liquidation data you can look at it and determine operational characteristics and what it does to the whole system. Now we finally have that data.  Bobface made a makerauctions.io site. I asked for the data and we pulled a CSV. We can look at scenarios as a result. We can use this for calculating compensations, should we decide on that. I just got my hands on the data, but I hope to provide a liquidation report soon. We should think about a liquidation dashboard. Conceptually, \u201cHow do you model this and what data do you need?\u201d that\u2019s what I\u2019m currently working on.    I have two sets of data. I should be able to run and match everything up. If I\u2019m lucky I have a vault number, I can see what happened by individual vaults and sort by vault number. It will take time, and I might need help and resources for things I might need.   There is data I want. Minute lead data on ETH<>USD price. Matching the OSM\u2019s to the CSV I have would be useful. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have a zero-bid liquidation report and a general liquidation report too. As of now, I have data.   Questions and Comments 6 56:20  Rich: Yet another example of community members hopping in and lifting efforts. If you have OSM data, tick data, minute-to-minute hour-to-hour regardless reach out to Makerman. Particularly if you are a stakeholder or deeply engaged with the zero-bid auctions. Once again, hit the forums there are long discussions there from the vault holders perspective, from a Governance perspective, from the ecosystem perspective. It\u2019s worth reviewing to continue momentum on this issue.  ",

About $380K from BAT.   About $800K from USDC, which is down a bit from it\u2019s all time high.   About $3.5 Million from the migration contract.      1046\u00d7550 133 KB    In terms of what the Collateral portfolio has been doing, ETH price is up compared to a few weeks ago.   Throughout this whole timeframe the Dai price has been steadily around a cent or two above the dollar.   As the ETH price went up in the past 48 hours the Dai price bowed slightly. Keeping the long term pattern of stability, but short term it fluctuates. Often inversely with ETH price movements. The Dai peg still holding a two cent buffer on peg.    1058\u00d7544 133 KB   1042\u00d7508 122 KB   Comparatively, the trading volume is low.   1082\u00d7483 112 KB    In the last 30 days $380 million Dai traded. Average price is $1.03 for the past month or so. That\u2019s happened naturally because of more trading closer to $1.02.   30 day volume significantly outpaced what we\u2019ve seen in the last 7-14 days. The past two weeks there is much lower volume.    1045\u00d7528 79.5 KB   A big chunk of volume occured on dYdX. During the crazier time frame, Oasis picked up more of its share of Dai trading. Now they are more even. Little bit more on Coinbase, less on Uniswap and slight pickup on Kyber.   1077\u00d7546 123 KB    The question on many minds is on whether the Dai price is going up, down, or staying stable? It\u2019s been staying steady, aside from short-timescale fluctuations in relation to ETH price behavior.   When the correlations between ETH and Dai flip: when ETH is crashing, Dai is very well negatively correlated to ETH. When ETH is rising in a longer time scale, confidence returns, you see the correlation resume of a more positive trend.   In the short term, if ETH is going down but in the long term people are confident about it going up you will see Dai go down in the short term. But if in the long run people are uncertain about ETH and in the short run the price goes down then Dai rises.   It\u2019s all about leverage. There is a fundamental shift in increased confidence and increased perceived value on holding Dai, which led to the 1-2 cent buffer on the Dai price. I said this last week, that buffer is still persisting.     We could discuss reasons for the buffer persisting, but what\u2019s interesting to note is  the slight uptick in activity over the last 2 or 3 days makes sense with ETH price starting to go up. That\u2019s if you assume people are more confident and bullish on ETH.  As the ETH price continues to comes up, if Dai price rises too, that could indicate a potential lack of confidence. People could be sourcing Dai to pay back loans or participate in liquidations. Since there isn\u2019t a strong yield case for holding Dai right now, it\u2019s much lower than it has been in the past. If they\u2019re sourcing Dai, it\u2019s not for minting new debt. It\u2019s likely more for market making and participating in liquidations and those types of activities.    The sentiment right now looks to be a bit of wait-and-see and a little hedging behavior.    1042\u00d7542 156 KB   What we sort-of saw with Vault positions, coming out of the March 12 crash, The price walls(projected dai liquidation levels) at $80 and $60 were at much lower prices at the time. It makes sense these tend to be relative to the current ETH price. If the ETH price goes up, your risk barriers move up as well. That\u2019s a trend we\u2019ve seen, a rebalancing behavior where when ETH price goes up the collateralizations stay steady and the liquidation prices move. This is the risk portfolio, as the ETH price came up recently we saw an uptick in the 200-250 category. Coming out of the crash situation there was a huge block of the debt sitting at 350 CR. It was bi-modal as of last week, where a skew and peak leading up to the 350 bucket and another at 500+.    Now it\u2019s got a \u2018w\u2019 shape with a rise in the 200-250 category. A bit more debt in more risky buckets, despite the ETH price coming up significantly. That indicates some rebalancing. People taking risks, or rather internalizing changing external variables and maintaining their risk.  Relevant Links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Questions and Comments 7 1:07:42   Will Remor: I was thinking about the relatively unusual behavior of the peg with ETH price going up and the weighted average price of Dai not coming down. Other than liquidity, or the use of Dai for trading elsewhere, have you got any thoughts about why we may start to see that new kind of trend?   Vishesh: I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that there\u2019s a new trend. If you reason about it like: why does Dai tend go up if ETH goes down? Well, people sourcing Dai to repay debt, liquidations, etc. That makes sense. Why would Dai go down if the ETH price is going up? People getting bullish, leveraging their positions and selling Dai in the process. So what\u2019s interesting here is, although ETH is going up, I wouldn\u2019t index too much on Dai going up, what I would index more on is Dai not going down. I think that is because there\u2019s still a hesitancy, potentially, on leverage, that people are more bullish on ETH and willing to lever up further.   Will Remor: That makes sense in itself, it\u2019s an interesting data point that potentially didn\u2019t have before in the previous cycles of leveraging/deleveraging. In this cycle there\u2019s an expectancy which I think may also have an effect on the distribution graph of the collateral ratio. The reason why you\u2019re seeing more of that collateralization going up is not necessarily because people are actually taking less risk-apetite, but just leaving the price of ETH going up. I think those two are kind of very related, in my view. The collateralization is actually moving to the right, and the effect of the price of Dai is not coming down because of that leveraging.   Vishesh: Here\u2019s the longer run, 30-day average graph(below.)      1702\u00d7831 191 KB    Vishesh: What you see here is the tracking between Dai and ETH. What\u2019s interesting is the flipping point, or the reversal here is because the ETH price dips slightly on April 1st and starts increasing on the 2nd and 3rd.   V: On the 1st there was a bit of a jump in the Dai peg and then slowly starts to deflate a little.   V: In the last two, three days it\u2019s just been a consistent climb in ETH, there has been no real dip in the ETH price, and then this Dai price starting to increase almost exactly as soon as the ETH price starts to increase.   V: A lot of this trading that\u2019s happening recently at the higher values is on Oasis.   V: Then we see Kyber and dYdX having a lot more of the trades spread, either really high or really low, compared to the average. What\u2019s happening is that there\u2019s potentially an inflationary effect from people market-making on Dai. A reasonable explanation would be people accumulating Dai in anticipation of what other users might do, which explains the increase.   V: An explanation for \u201cnot having a decrease\u201d, it could be that sentiment might not have changed on using Maker for leverage despite of the price of ETH going up.   Will Remor: That makes sense. The graph on the ETH price, there\u2019s also the velocity of the uptick which also might explain a lag between them. On the 2nd and 3rd of April the velocity is lower compared to the last couple days, therefore there could be a lag in the leveraging and positioning.   V: It would make sense that people may not trust a sudden increase, whereas longer run increases may have more of an impact on sentiment. If ETH is bullish over time, people may be more bullish on taking leverage. If ETH suddenly increases, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily cause a lot of people to take leverage because if it\u2019s a sudden jump,   A) they may not trust that it\u2019s going to continue to increase and   B) they may have this mentality of having missed the boat in the jump, so it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to take leverage right now.       1:14:34   Cmooney: Do we have any data on other platforms that provide leverage on ETH as it\u2019s rising? Growth, or more leverage? I\u2019m trying to see if this is a market-wide trend or if there\u2019s a loss of confidence in the Maker protocol.   Vishesh: We did see, in the last 24 hours or so, 2% increase in the borrow on Compound. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a large enough margin to be making conclusions per s\u00e9, but there have been more loans taken out as well on Compound. I don\u2019t necessarily think those are outpacing Maker.   V: There was a slight increase in the Dai minted overall as well. Those increases aren\u2019t necessarily out of frame with what has been happening on Maker. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strong case yet for Maker losing market share to other platforms. That would  definitely be something to continue to watch as there\u2019s more activity globally. But, at least in terms of Dai borrowing, and in terms of secondary lending platforms, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re yet at a place of concluding that there\u2019s been a huge uptick in activity and Maker has not.     [1:16:31(https://youtu.be/UvIppQzmFWY?t=4591)   MakerMan: If you can Vishesh, bring up that long-term chart again. Because I don\u2019t hear you talking about it, but, somebody closed a $6-million Vault. I think it was a vault, not a CDP. That\u2019s what drove the peg to $1.04. I didn\u2019t even see it on the chat, the $1.04 price on Coinbase. It went to $1.045 while this guy was just hammering the Dai-USDC pair to get his liquidity and that spread out. Everybody was trying to source liquidity to match his asks, so you can see these spikes.   MakerMan: Somebody posted the CDP that actually closed out. And he did it for about two hours just hammering on the ask, and then put up a 1.04 bid and just took everything that he could get. If you look at the chart carefully you see these sharp little dips and doodles and around those you see a lot of the liquidity spikes, all the printed trades. It\u2019s kind of hard to make out the details of those printed trades, you just see the bloody spread on them, right? There was a big dip, that was our big event.  If you watch this on the market, you typically see Dai being sourced when ETH price goes down. Absolutely right on that. The mystery here is that we have been having ETH price rising, so why is the peg still high. There was a last bump that I don\u2019t even see on here that hit $1.04 on Coinbase. I see the 1.03s, but not the $1.04. And I know it was there because I traded it. I don\u2019t see a lot of the data, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.   MakerMan: Literally, 6 million out of 80 million outstanding is 10% of available supply. And when you start crunching numbers on that, these kind of moves are being driven by a just general lack of liquidity in this event, and a lot of people were hurt. The understanding here is that normal activity is happening, but there\u2019s and underlying driver for liquidity.   MakerMan: Which brings me to the other point, related to the Sai SCD closure. CDP 3088 has been active recently, people don\u2019t know this, but they woke up, and they bought some MKR. They haven\u2019t moved or closed their CDP. Whoever has that CDP, please talk to the community. Generally there\u2019s a lot of liquidity that\u2019s trying to be sourced in these markets for various reasons, whether they\u2019re short, or whatever, I don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re trying to close out their positions and get back access to their ETH, particularly during this price rise.   MakerMan: I think that\u2019s the reason why this peg is really still staying up. People who were going Dai short already at $1.03 and still haven\u2019t maybe closed. You would expect it during this huge rise for the peg to go down. I minted Dai there, I sold it. Who\u2019s buying it and closing it out? And then we have, not long ago, the Maker Protocol going on the market and buying Dai, effectively to burn it to cover what we lost. And so I see that as an effective burn.   MakerMan: I think this whole market is Dai supply hoarding to some extent and market participants just can\u2019t find it because we have to have collateral to have it and that\u2019s my uptake(view) on all this. While it looks weird, we just don\u2019t know what to do about it, so I\u2019m done with this. Thank you everybody for putting up with this rant.   Rich Brown: Thanks to you MakerMan. It was good insights. I think there was a question in the beginning: why does the graph  not reflect that Dai activity. It looks like in the chat LongForWisdom might have pointed out that Dai-USDC doesn\u2019t show up in that graph, Is that true, Vishesh?   Vishesh: No, Dai-USDC is not covered. It\u2019s not on the data set yet.     Outro 1:22:42   Rich Brown: Alright, cool, so we\u2019re almost at one hour and a half, perfectly. Maybe we can put a fork in it there unless there are last-minute burning questions. I\u2019ll give people time while I do the post-amble.   Governance happens in the forums. Lots and lots of activity, important things are happening, big decisions are getting made in real time. So please don\u2019t sleep on the fact that things are going on and that your input is required so please join us in the forums and be heard.   Thanks everybody.

Today we have governance, a recap of the Forum activity, Oracles, and Risk. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance  Good news, the Governance Facilitator role passed with a 99.9% approval rating, while the Risk Team mandate passed with a 100% approval rating. We\u2019ve had movement forward on questions about cadence of SF adjustments and also about the rate stepping levels in the SF adjustment votes. MKR holders have continued to lower the SF. This shows their interest in managing monetary policy effectively, rather than keeping rates high because of greed, which was a recurring criticism when the rates began to rise over the course of this year. The Governance Poll for SF passed with another 2% decrease to 12.5%  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 05:40   Governance at a Glance Thread  Cyrus recently posted about DSR Initial values  This thread is open for feedback and discussion.    Current Signaling Process: regarding issues and the forum polls  This thread outlines the current signaling process as LFW sees its. Agree? Disagree? Share your thoughts here. Suggestion to split the process into three stages which are outlined in the thread.    TUSD - Adding as collateral to MCD  The team behind TUSD has completed our first collateral on-boarding request form. Do we want TUSD as collateral for MCD? What are the pros and cons?    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  A significant amount of people voted to have this put on-chain as a Governance Poll Conversations are ongoing of what the standard is for getting the Foundation to put the poll up. Rich hopes that once consensus has been established that a timer starts and perhaps the next week the poll would go up. Rich: I want the community to consider that even if there isn\u2019t overwhelming support in the forum, there still might be value in putting something up to a Governance Poll for MKR holders to vote on.    Oracles Nik Recap 21:00   Last week we talked about the Oracle ecosystem within the Maker protocol, the different facets, and about four different proposals for the community to consider.  I am on track to publish some of these proposals on the forum by today or tomorrow. They will be located in both the Governance and Oracle section of the forum.   I want to touch on a few questions regarding why we\u2019re doing this, and why now:  The oracles were always meant to be handed over to governance as a part of the gradual decentralization commitment from the Foundation In particular, I think the most confusing proposal was the one talking about incentives (see diagram below).     fxRflsR.png1600\u00d71339 188 KB    24:42: In regards to this diagram, which is part of the Oracle Incentives Restructuring proposal (Proposal 4):  Definitions:   Feed: an individual who is running a bot that is pushing price updates for an asset.  Oracle: a smart contract, on-chain, that other smart contracts can query for a price.  Whitelist: a list of smart-contract addresses that governance controls that can read prices from Oracles.  Oracles receive inputs from the Feeds and publishes the median value.   Bottom left to the top are the MKR holders who pay feeds. Top to the bottom right illustrates the relationship of data consumers using data provided by the feeds, ultimately through the Oracle for a given asset. Bottom right to bottom left illustrates the idea that data consumers will compensate MKR token holders for providing the data for them through their Oracles. The proposal is that Oracles are private and can only provide data to whitelisted consumers of the data. Why did we set it up that way? The main two reasons are sustainability and decentralization.  Currently, the Devfund is paying feeds for their service. Eventually, MKR holders will take on that cost using the Stability Fees. If MKR holders are spending money on feeds, they need to be able to monetize it to recoup their costs. Governance controls the whitelist, and in doing so can monetize Oracles.     There are non-monetary ways to extract value out of whitelisted Oracle access.  For example, a DEX out there needs Oracle prices for some margin products that they are creating. MakerDAO can say, \u201cWe will give you feeds in exchange for listing all your token pairs against Dai.\u201d   One of the proposals, Proposal 4.5, was to offer Oracles free for the first year.  This is to give room for projects that are currently dependent on our oracles. The whitelist doesn\u2019t have to be used right away; it is a tool for MKR holders to use down the road.   The acceptance of the whitelisting proposal does not mean that it will happen from day 1. It is an explicit approval that this is the model we are moving towards.  Questions  Do they have a requirement to own MKR, or to have any other reasonable motivation to provide valid price data\u2013besides integrity?  Feeds get paid From a technical point of view, we can aide in risk-mitigating here. Should they stake MKR? Nik believes that yes, they should stake MKR. There are a few things we can do here.    Risk Cyrus Dai Savings Rate 33:39   We will go more in-depth next week after this material has been given some time to be exposed to the community. Skipping the mechanics portion of it, I will focus mainly on the governance and risk portions. The first major educational topic is where the DSR even comes from and how it\u2019s created.  The DSR has the functionality to print Dai and give it to you regardless of any exogenous factors. At first glance, this seems concerning, but in reality, the amount of DSR that is created is counted against the collected Stability Fees such that if there wasn\u2019t enough collected SFs to pay the DSR, the DSR gets recorded as bad debt and would trigger MKR dilution to cover the loss. In the end, the DSR is technically paid for by MKR holders out of SFs.   The question posed to the community is, \u201cwhat to do about that cost?\u201d Should MKR holders absorb it? Should they pass on this cost to CDP users? Should it be a hybrid?  If we rely on CDP owners across the board to cover the cost, it may result in pricing out certain collateral types that would command a low-interest rate, since the market would beat our rates too easily. To what extent do we allow the subsidization of the DSR by various CDP types? Other questions are, how do we go about calculating and evaluating these phenomena? Will we even be able to assess whether certain collateral types have more or less of an effect on Dai price.    Questions   40:43: Why not just start the DSR at zero and then increase it?  One answer to that is, under the current one-month Governance cycle we are proposing, we\u2019re not sure at what cadence the DSR adjustments would come in at. If we will have frequent cadence adjustments, perhaps we can start at 0, yes.    01:11:17: Do the feeds have any requirements to own MKR or any reasonable incentive to provide valid data?  The current incentive for them to provide valid data is that they get paid. If they fail at their job, then they can be removed from being a feed. From a technology point of view, we can aide in risk-mitigating here by potentially requiring MKR staking. Partly because the more, they have to lose, and the more their integrity will be guaranteed. Then we get to the question of what the right amount of MKR is needed for them to stake, and so on.    Vishesh Dai Analytics 42:50  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  Context: Eth price has been relatively flat for the last week or so.  PQuo8p6.png1572\u00d7770 58.4 KB   This has been reflected in what\u2019s been going on with collateral. Collateral levels have remained fairly stable and quiet. Not much added or removed since the end of August.  d0QjVOW.png877\u00d7541 116 KB   We saw a few drops to the Stability Fee over the last few weeks. During these first few drops, we still saw a dropping Dai supply. On the most recent drops, we saw the Dai supply rising slightly. We\u2019re up a couple million in the last few days.  YZKshL4.png871\u00d7522 151 KB   Long term activity: in collateral terms, at the beginning of the year, people collateralized a lot to manage their risk. As the year has gone on, we see slowing down of locked collateral. Overall collateralization has gone down, which is seen as the spread between the red and blue lines in the graph below. However, since August, the amount being removed(blue line) had slowed down significantly, and the amount locked began to increase again.  4saXdWd.png1237\u00d7524 126 KB   The amount of debt being drawn(cumulative draw) slowed down beginning in mid-July.  JWx9ktm.png1261\u00d7522 134 KB   The relationship between ETH price and collateral has an inverse relationship, a phenomenon that is well known at this point(in this community). When ETH goes down, locked collateral tends to go up. When ETH goes up, locked collateral tends to go down.  2Q48y8R.png1070\u00d7526 120 KB   The relationship between debt and ETH price is not straightforward. No clear correlation.  JGKEVEa.png1051\u00d7637 138 KB   The Dai peg itself has been trading at 1-1.02 in the last 24 hours. 24hr Volume Weighted Average Price is 1.011  Only about a million in trading volume, half of what we usually see on quiet days.  0K5EqRd.jpg1653\u00d7735 146 KB     On the seven-day time scale, we see a bimodal distribution. This is because the price traded differently for a couple of days at some point during the week.  Overall, Dai price has been trading in a very narrow band with low variability.  QYbZYzY.jpg1632\u00d7617 151 KB      Secondary Lending Platforms: 50:47   With the changes in the Stability Fees and an overall lower Dai supply, it is easier for some of these platforms to run into a crunch. SLP rates tend to respond to SF changes, though the most recent decrease did not trigger too much responsiveness.  xKMn5Xs.png1877\u00d7773 82.4 KB   Regarding borrow volumes:  For dydx, borrow volumes rose 20-30% in the last three weeks. From 6MM to 9.5MM. For Compound, we saw a slight loss in borrow volumes. Borrow volume for Dai has been steadily at 26-27MM for the last couple of months. Total borrow volume has slightly increased, though comparatively pretty level.  tGXhE1b.png1874\u00d7762 45.4 KB     Regarding supply volumes:  The total supply at the end of July was around 35MM and now is up to about 48MM. This is a significant increase that corresponds with the dropping SF as well. Supply volumes have continued to increase steadily.  9l7uz5i.png1871\u00d7776 42.2 KB     Excess Dai in reserves of these SLPs has been increasing while Utilization rates have been decreasing.  Utilization rates tend to stay around 70-75% This is an interesting time we are in right now as there is a lower SF, there is more excess supply on lending platforms(Which we\u2019ve discussed that it can be interpreted generally as excess supply), and given that the total Dai supply has been pretty steady the increasing excess can be interpreted as a drop in overall demand for Dai.  bw2HPPV.png1878\u00d7771 54.2 KB    JFhcFzi.png1876\u00d7798 67.7 KB     My advice is to keep an eye on how much we\u2019re dropping the SF because though the Dai price is doing well right now if we see a sudden bull market that would be a pretty fluid situation where you would see SLP rates for Dai respond quickly. It would be interesting to see what happens in this situation and how resilient Dai would be.  Questions to Vishesh   49:30: Why is the distribution not following the normal bell-curve distribution lately?  Lower volume will do that. When there are lower volumes, it\u2019s easier to be a victim of slippage and have price impact with larger trades. On low volume days, it\u2019s interesting to observe the microstructure patterns of different exchanges. Kyber, for example, is on the low and high end of these prices. Coinbase is usually dead center. Oasis is generally dead center, with a broader spread. Uniswap is pretty flat throughout and gets pushed up to a higher or lower end.   Is the data on the VWAP graph from Kyber double-counted, since Kyber sources liquidity from Oasis?  The data is provided by Lev\u2019s group, and from what I understand, there is filtering for that going on.    58:56: Does it make sense to add USDC-DAI pair to the VWAP chart?  I don\u2019t think there is a reason not to do it, though right now all the data is DEX ETH-DAI trades. I think it\u2019s just an operation thing where we haven\u2019t gotten around to adding it.    Post-Call Discussion 01:00:01  DSR   01:01:00: After DSR, when making changes to DSR/SF, will both be moved at the same time, or will the DSR be preferred over the SF?  We don\u2019t know the answer right now. We will have to see how things work on. Essentially, it depends on the type of behavior you want to incentivize. If we wanted to create more demand for Dai, we could raise the DSR without necessarily touching the SF. The question this raises is, do you also raise the SF to compensate for that extra DSR? And I guess if you did both, they would have separate effects on Dai. We will have to learn through the governance community how we want to use these tools. One potential idea is that SFs could all be evaluated on a monthly cadence, while the DSR itself can be changed separately on a weekly cadence. In terms of preference, I think there will be one. It will probably require more sophisticated statistical models on the supply and demand of Dai and their reactions to each policy tool.    01:04:20: Any thoughts around a pooled model for DAI locked in DSR with an underlying token that has a claim on the asset pool? (Similar to Compound)  Tokenized DSR is an interesting idea. It\u2019s certainly technically possible, and I don\u2019t doubt it will happen regardless.    01:05:06: On the cadence of SF adjustments:  Personally, I don\u2019t think you can set a standard cadence. Once per month might be a standard, but I imagine there might be times when you need to make a mid-month adjustment.    01:06:11: Will DSR/SF be used to keep the Dai supply growing at a slow pace?  The pace for keeping Dai stable, and debt ceilings reasonable is what is the goal. The real question to ask is at what rate should the global debt ceiling be grown.    01:07:02: You mentioned we could potentially increase the DSR without increasing Stability Fees, does that affect the risk of the system?  Yes, in a roundabout way. If MKR dilution potential is lowered, because MKR holders are now essentially paying for DSR, then there is less MKR dilution potential for the rest of the system. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge deal on a small scale. But surely in certain situations, it can create a huge problem for sure. It has to be within limits. Something MKR holders are comfortable with.    01:15:03: REPv1 versus REPv2 for MCD  I think their community themselves are suggesting that we hold off and wait for REPv2. I\u2019m on board with that as well, especially considering the overhead for pushing a collateral type through. It might not make sense to include collateral that is not going to live too long. If a collateral application gets filled out, and MKR holders want it, they will get it. This brings up the question of how often we should repoll the Asset Priority List. When a token upgrades it also calls into question the procedure around what the Oracles should do regarding that asset.

I am the head of Community development at MakerDAO, and finally, after a long and tense wait, I am no longer the only Governance Facilitator. Today is a big day for me. Governance has evolved in many many ways in the past two years and has become fantastically complicated, which was the plan, I guess? Well, let\u2019s call it sophisticated to be charitable. Lots to do, lots of threads to manage, issues like consensus, debate, and coordination are a large large project. I wear many hats, and I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to devote the attention to what\u2019s happening here actually deserves. I haven\u2019t been quiet about that.   I\u2019ve been enormously interested in expanding the pool of resources community has for itself to make sure the Governance machine keeps running. Happily, the hero we needed arose: LongForWisdom showed up. It turns out that this is the best possible universe. He is interested in Governance and helped out. He basically kicked ass in general. And through the power of meritocracies and open Governance was elected. Anyways, he blew us all away; being willing to step up and adopt the responsibilities of a Governance Facilitator is no small feat. It\u2019s a thankless job; the amount of work involved is tremendous. But there is a considerable amount of plus sides. It\u2019s absolutely fascinating work.   One of the things MakerDAO is good at is being on the leading edge of the curve. Doing things that haven\u2019t been done before, or, at least, at this scale. That\u2019s a fascinating place to be. There are many interesting problems to solve, and having someone like Long come along with the capacity and insight is a huge win for the ecosystem. I\u2019m enormously happy to announce that he is now the other Governance Facilitator. Potentially outranking me since I\u2019m just an Interim-GF.   He was ratified via executive vote, a non-trivial thing, and to do that, people needed to pull out hardware wallets and move value around on-chain to vote. A value of about $25 million in MKR supported his election and ratification. This is an encouraging day for all of us, but I\u2019ll give him a pass on a speech. I think he\u2019ll say something like, \u201cthanks, I guess?\u201d   On the agenda we have Governance at a Glance, an update on the Oracle MIPs, Charles will do the weekly MIPs update, and soon after, we\u2019ll do housekeeping for MIPs as outlined in the governance cycle, then State of the Pegs.   Agenda is light today, comparatively, which gives more opportunity for Q&A. If people have a topic to discuss, then we can dig into those issues later. For example, one thing I keep seeing resurface is liquidations and how we deal with IOU tokens in the Protocol. Things like that, larger threads that were raised recently but not exhaustively explored.   Discussions happen in the forum.   Governance Governance at a Glance LongForWisdom 06:09   I\u2019ll briefly thank everyone for the trust they placed in me; that\u2019s gratifying, thank you. Expect for the first few weeks to be slightly chaotic as we try to figure out how work is being split. Once that\u2019s over, we\u2019ll prepare to get more done.   Rich: Rousing speech! [laughs]   LFW: I put my all into it [laughs] I was frantically googling famous speeches earlier but figured \u201cI have a dream\u2026\u201d was a bit over the top.   Discussion threads   Business Policy of Rate Setting  Primoz\u2019s thread. Well worth a read.    Really bad form to group process votes on the SF structure with a USDC fee rise  Interestingly, in this thread, Rune made a post sharing mechanism to upgrade the system we have technically. The easiest way to fix things is to design a build a spell that\u2019s always active. Then build the system on top of DSchief. Making migration easier etc.    Regulatory Recourse - Quantifying Centralized Stablecoin Risk  Using regulatory recourse as an input on how risky Stablecoins are.    Signaling & other notable threads   Change Monetary Policy Votes to Ranked Choice   Change the Frequency of the Base Rate Poll to Monthly  The majority so far prefers to keep the votes to weekly since we\u2019re still trying to stabilize Dai and don\u2019t want to negatively affect our response time. And also, we just moved to the new SF structure, so before reducing the cadence, we should make sure that works as intended.    Signaling process guide  I wrote this new and improved guide to help if community members want to do signaling threads.    Discussion - Add on-chain governance metadata  See discussion at 14:08.    Discussion 1 10:14   Cyrus: Can we have a brief recap on ranked-choice voting?  Sam: Ranked-choice voting is a different form of voting than \u201cfirst past the post\u201d(which we\u2019ve been using.) This is where the option with the highest plurality wins the vote overall. Ranked-choice allows you to select multiple choices, 1st 2nd 3rd. With an instant runoff voting as the algorithm to determine the winner, it reallocates the votes towards an overwhelming 50% majority. This system is great for having more than two options where first past the post may not fit well. For a simple Yes/no decision first past the post or ranked-choice are equivalent. However, for things like fee votes and the vote from last week base rate and two variants, ranked-choice is far superior. Ranked-choice allows you to be more clearer in your preference.    14:08   SamM: A problem I\u2019m seeing emerge right now is as we add more layers of abstraction between the smart contract parameters and Governance; It\u2019s not clear how we keep track of these. Starting with the DSR spread, which isn\u2019t a system parameter, it\u2019s a Governance construct. Last week splitting the fees between the base rate and the risk premium. As well, last week, there were a couple of threads for debt ceiling caps on all centralized Stablecoins. As we add not-code level abstractions, it helps to keep these numbers on-chain. Maybe the MakerDAO team could add their insights or thoughts.  Cmooney: I can say we\u2019ve had a ticket internally for other concerns, but it\u2019s related. The subject is an  Ilk registry on-chain; so that you could see the amount of collateral(s) that are there. Spells are getting long-winded, and people have trouble interacting without the ability iterate them on-chain. We do need an on-chain source of these things. At the very least, committing to the concepts of those things and what they are would be nice to have. Beyond nice to have, in the case of an  Ilk registry, it\u2019s almost a necessity. People should consider it, and it would be the right technical move.    Oracles Oracles and MIP 10 Nik Kunkel 17:45 MIP10 helping the Oracles Team   I\u2019ve been quiet on Oracle things for a while. The new MIP system was a big deal for us because MIP 10 covers all of the governance functionality that we need.   Before we were doing these ad-hoc, bespoke actions every single time. Now there are actual processes. When people approach us to use or create an oracle, it\u2019s straightforward to point them to MIP 10, they can post it in the forum, and they\u2019re all set.   DeFi Saver applied for whitelisting on the oracles  DeFi Saver applied for whitelisting on all of our collateral oracles for their automation software. That\u2019s the one that saves Vaults when they get below a certain threshold. In my opinion, we should support applications like this, to help prevent Vault liquidations; third-party services like these are covering vaults in distress.  Feeds   Feeds are the data providers for Oracles. Governance controls the membership of Feeds. There are both dark-feeds (anonymous entities) and light-feeds (public organizations that are stakeholders in the ecosystem). Currently, the light-feeds are:   dYdX   0x   SetProtocol   Gnosis   Maker Foundation     We just got an application this week from Kyber to run a light-feed. Personally, I think it\u2019s a great thing. I think we need more light feeds. I think we need more stakeholders in the ecosystem to become light-feeds. The more we have this decentralized web of providers, the more robust our Oracles will be.   It still ends up being a multi-sig, though multi-sigs work pretty well. There hasn\u2019t been an order of magnitude of improvement to replace multi-sigs. It\u2019s more of an incremental improvement in our current architecture, of getting more reputable organizations to run light-feeds. I\u2019m already in talks with a couple of potential partners to help them through the filing process for filling out the MIP and where to post it on the forum.   Partners still need a lot of handholding, but I think we\u2019re going in the right direction. Now I can point to these examples so they know how to proceed in the future. I believe that in the coming weeks, we\u2019ll see a lot of Oracle related applications.   Discussion 2 22:04   Nik: I see a question in the chat about enabling fees.  Nik: Back in September, we passed the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal. Part of that was giving oracle services away for free for one year from the day when the individual entity gets access to them. That\u2019s still the case. I think this is helpful in one respect because it helps us onboard a bunch of groups that otherwise if they had to pay for Oracles, would not be able to pay for them right now. And it allows us to get access to these young companies that need time to bootstrap first. I don\u2019t think we should be stalling innovation in the space. There are a lot of DeFi applications that need oracles, so if we can provide them, I think we should. Even if it doesn\u2019t make us that much in the short term. In the medium term, we can institute fees, offset oracle costs, or start to profit from them. I think the free oracle model is a good one right now, at least from a growth perspective.    24:06   LongForWisdom: Crispy on the chat asks what is the annual costs of running an oracle. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s talking about the stipend or actual cost of running things.   Nik: Each of the feeds gets paid 1,000 Dai a month. Currently, that is funded by the Foundation. The intention is that when Stability Fees start to pick up again, and Governance has a stream of revenue, the Protocol is going to start paying for this. Those are the major costs. Then there\u2019s also the gas cost for the relayers, so technically everyone can run a relayer, and there are some game-theoretic reasons for why you would want to run a relayer if you\u2019re a keeper or if you\u2019re a speculator who wants maximum leverage. In the short term, those are not enough, and you need people running them on an altruistic basis or a compensated basis. There\u2019s a bunch of partners who are running relayers. There\u2019s a bunch of Maker Foundation relayers; I\u2019m running one or two relayers, I always encourage people to run them as well. The ultimate thing is that there need to be at least some relayers that have guaranteed uptime because the Protocol compensates them in some manner. I haven\u2019t quite thought through how that should work, but it\u2019s something on my to-do list. Given that there are 20 feeds, that\u2019s 20k a month times 12 months a year, that\u2019s about 240k to 260k annually.   Nik: The cool thing is that to make a new oracle, there are some fixed costs. You need to spend developer resources to program that oracle, you need to roll out the update to the feeds, you need to make sure that the update has been thoroughly tested, then point the relayers to it and you now have this extra fixed gas costs. Not set in the sense of the gas price, but in the sense that every new oracle has minimum gas units annually that you will be adding to your expenses. The cool thing is that to whitelist a new entity costs us nothing. The more people you can get whitelisted on a single oracle, the more your per-customer costs are coming down, or from another perspective, the more profit you can make out of that oracle.     27:19   I see another question: Can you describe what it means to have access to an on-chain oracle?   Nik: Governance puts an entity on the whitelist, and the whitelist lets people read an oracle price. If you\u2019re not on the whitelist, you can\u2019t read the oracle price from the v2 oracles.   LongForWisdom: just to specify, that\u2019s on-chain contracts that can\u2019t read the oracle price.   Nik: Yes. Everyone reading the blockchain off-chain can do whatever they want. Anyone reading the blockchain can also query the Coinbase price, that\u2019s not the business that we\u2019re in.     Maker Improvement Proposals Weekly Update Charles Saint Louis 28:40 LongForWisdom as a Governance Facilitator  This week\u2019s activity, the executive vote to affect LongForWisdom went out on Monday, and the vote passed today. So now, officially, LongForWisdom is a Governance Facilitator. So his proposal can now be officially marked as accepted.  Community Greenlight Polls Published   Additionally, on Monday, we ran the first community greenlight polls.   Just to clarify, the polls will run for two weeks as of Monday. There was a little confusion as MIP9 had a few inconsistencies in the language, but the thought behind the two weeks is to give people that aren\u2019t as active in the governance process a chance to vote. Also, to provide forum updates as well as display current results over two weeks so people can be more updated.   With that being said, I do plan to propose an amendment to make them last the last two weeks of the governance cycle and correct certain inconsistencies as well to make them work better with the governance cycle flow. I\u2019ll get to more amendment details later.   Governance Cycle Review   The Governance Facilitators will perform a Governance Cycle Review that they feel is necessary to summarize and discuss the last governance cycle of May. This meeting can also be used as an opportunity to discuss any upcoming governance cycle or potential submissions for June\u2019s governance cycle.   So with that, I\u2019d like to do a recap of the May governance cycle:   The first governance cycle is coming to an end.   We\u2019ve had the first MIP sub-proposal go through the governance process and get successfully ratified, which is a pretty significant milestone, at least in my opinion.   MIP13, the Declarations of Intent, has been introduced by LongForWisdom.   MIP14, the Protocol Dai Transfer, by LongForWisdom as well, and is the RFC phase.   MIP15, the Dark Fix Mechanism, by Wil Barnes.   All of these proposals are currently in the Request For Comments phase, so don\u2019t forget to give feedback or request changes from the author, so that they can work the fixes and better reflect the community sentiment towards them.     Ammendments to the MIPs   Lastly, as we went through the first governance cycle, we learned about what works and how to improve it for the future. Especially the collateral onboarding flow, and making people aware of the processes that are occurring during a governance cycle. As a result, I drafted four amendment MIPs to address some of the confusion and make things more consistent and also make the governance cycle and the collateral onboarding processes more efficient for everyone. So I\u2019m going to propose these amendment MIPs later on so you can all dig into them on the forums. I will give a quick overview of what the changes will entail.   The plan is to amend MIP6, MIP8, MIP9, and MIP12.   MIP6 amendment: Changes are to remove the requirement of needing Domain Greenlights before being eligible for a community greenlight poll. This amendment would allow collateral applications to be eligible for MIP9 Community Greenlight polls at least two weeks after the MIP6 application has been proposed, moving the Domain Greenlight process to after the polls have concluded.   MIP8 amendment: It will be some tweaks to reinforce the above point I just mentioned and to effectively highlight that domain greenlight should occur after the community greenlight poll happens, allowing the domain teams to use the community greenlight poll results to make a more informed decision and proceed with their domain work with the backing of community sentiment.   MIP9 amendment: This amendment proposes some minor language edits and separation of components. So taking the two components and separating them into four, to further clarify as well as address some of the inconsistencies that I\u2019ve detailed earlier about MIP9. More specifically, this consists of information about the duration of the polls, when they occur, how long they occur for, and general updates regarding the scoring framework for the polls. We have also updated the poll template to reflect better and have more information in the poll itself so people can click on it when they vote.   MIP12 ammendment: This is the process where the domain teams bundle their work and submit a sub-proposal including their work to formally enter the governance cycle, ultimately going through the cycle and, if it gets ratified, the collateral type is added to the Protocol. So this consists of some changes to allow the onboarding collateral process to operate more efficiently.     An amendment is a MIP with the explanation of the intentions behind it, as well as a link to the PR that edits the active MIP in question.   I have the intention of proposing them for June\u2019s governance cycle so that we can get these areas cleaned up and allow the future governance cycles to be more efficient as soon as we can.   Next Week\u2019s Activity   Next week\u2019s activities; this will be the 1st week of the 2nd ever governance cycle.   On Monday, from June 1st to 4th, is the official formal submission period for June\u2019s governance cycle where MIPs or sub proposals in the request for comments phase can enter the governance cycle and wait for approval for the governance facilitators to formally start the process in week 2 with an inclusion poll.   Next Thursday, the Governance Facilitators will do the submission review as part of the governance meeting in which they will determine which of the proposed MIPs are following the guidelines defined in MIP0 and if they should get included in the inclusion polls.   Collateral Onboarding   I\u2019ll talk a bit about collateral onboarding. Both the TUSD and the USDC-B governance polls passed successfully today, meaning that they will go for an executive vote.   Note that these assets are still following the weekly cycle and not the monthly governance cycle, as I\u2019ve previously mentioned. This is because we\u2019re still in the transition period.   You can check out the results on the voting dashboards.     Given that the community green light poll will conclude in 2 weeks, the MIP12 proposals that include the domain work for the agreed-upon collateral assets will not be ready for the June governance cycle. It will be more likely that they enter July\u2019s governance cycle.   Community Greenlight Poll Scoring   I wanted to go over the CGP scoring briefly because I got some questions about it.   The score is the yes votes minus the no votes. If a score is greater than zero, then it is effectively greenlit. If it\u2019s less than zero, it\u2019s deferred.   So these polls provide this reasonable first approximation of which assets the domain teams should prioritize going forward and which ones they should work on. However, this prioritization is not binding on the domain teams, and they have the freedom to determine the order in which they work on the assets that have passed community greenlight.   I\u2019ll post this update on the forums as usual and keep an eye on RocketChat for the amendments that will come out later today or tomorrow.   ",

                    "content": "Governance Governance Cycle Review LongForWisdom 37:43 Introduction  I\u2019ll go through the explanation briefly. Week 4 of the governance cycle includes a Governance Cycle Review, in which the Governance Facilitators summarize and discuss the previous governance cycle and potentially open the discussion around the upcoming governance cycle and what could be in it.  Review   In terms of the last governance cycle, there was a proposal that onboarded me as a governance facilitator. I\u2019ll go through the different polls that have happened and what sort of participation they got and what weight of MKR landed on each poll.   The Inclusion poll had 20 unique voters. The yes-weight was 5.7k MKR, and there was 400 MKR, so there was quite a lot of participation in that one.   The second poll, normally, would have been the bundled poll, which included everything in the inclusion poll. In this case, it was the same poll again, mostly. That one only had nine voters and 5,000 MKR-weight on yes, and 0 MKR on no. The number of voters dropped off on this. I suspect, in this case, it was because it was the same as the previous vote. We\u2019ll pay attention to what sort of participation levels the various stages of the governance cycle get as we go forward.   The last stage was to do the executive, which ended with some 70k MKR in support, most of which was added today.     I think overall, there was a reasonable participation level for the first governance cycle. Ideally, next cycle, we will see more than one MIP or sub-proposal. The inclusion poll will be meaningful, and that will determine what\u2019s included in next month\u2019s cycle. Does anybody have any thoughts on the upcoming MIPs? Charles briefly went over them. That was MIP13, Declaration of Intent; MIP14, Protocol Dai Transfer; And MIP15, Dark Fix Protocol.   Discussion 3 40:48   Charles St. Louis: as for MIP15, I believe, it\u2019s not going to fall on the June cycle. It\u2019s going to follow the Request for Comments phase detailed in MIP 0, which is a 3-month long period because it\u2019s not officially like a MIP2 proposal.  LFW: Yes, you\u2019re right. To clarify, MIP2 is the MIP that states that the feedback on frozen periods can be skipped mostly for the first few months. I haven\u2019t fully yet decided if MIP13 and MIP14 will go into the next Governance cycle, as there\u2019s some discussion on MIP13 specifically. I think MIP14 will probably go in. MIP13 I\u2019m unsure about. I don\u2019t know how many people here have read it, but if anyone has and has any comments, feel free. Rich, is there anything that you wanted to discuss the upcoming governance cycle or the previous governance cycle?    42:05   Rich Brown: The 2 MIPs that you submitted have relatively broad implications for the governance environment. I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot immediately. Usually, I love doing that. So maybe next week, or after the top of the hour in the Q&A session, maybe you can talk about them?   LongForWisdom: Yes.   Rich Brown: For the uninitiated, LongForWisdom put up 2 MIPs into the forums that are pretty weighty and allow the community a level of autonomy that it\u2019s never enjoyed in the past, and there are significant implications there. Most of them are positive. It allows the community to come up with an idea and propose funding for it through governance. Usually, the community is hamstrung because of the question of \u201cwho\u2019s going to pay for that?\u201d This set of MIPs answers that question. This is a method that allows the protocol to have true autonomy over its own funds. Though it is worth thinking more deeply about the potential issues that might exist.   Forum Thread for MIP13   Forum Thread for MIP14     Analysis The State of the Pegs Vishesh 44:39 1077\u00d7555 163 KB  At a glance, total Dai still around 120 million.  1108\u00d7551 176 KB   This chart is the last 30-days of Dai performance.   At the end of April/beginning of May, Dai was at an elevated price.   Dai price started to come down in line with the ETH price rise. Dai touched and even dipped below peg on May 24th.   Then on May 20th, just as Dai price was coming down, ETH price took a dip and caused Dai price to jump back up (May 24th - May 28th.)   As ETH started to come up, Dai did its inverse behavior, moving down closer to the peg. Last time ETH dipped and came back up, there was a positive correlation with Dai. This time, it resumed its negative correlation.  As ETH started to pump, people did take some leverage and sold some Dai. This pump helped to bring DAI price down a bit. Immediately after that, the ETH price started to come back down, Dai\u2019s price resumed its trend.    Kind of funny, but that scenario illustrates how Dai has this negative correlation to ETH in normal times and starts to exhibit a positive correlation during potentially riskier times.   ETH price in the last few days began to come back down a bit, and DAI price has started to rise a bit. Now they are back dancing in perfect lockstep with negative correlation.   ETH has been wobbling for the last couple of months, and now Dai has started wobbling in correlation. This means that leverage behavior sensitivity isn\u2019t just based on sentiment or global perception of crypto or system-specific risk but has now resumed a total market-price dependency. Which means that people are once again willing to lever up, speculate, and trade. Confidence appears to be restored, but it is still early and is something to watch.   WBTC Chart1041\u00d7514 39.6 KB  Dai from WBTC jumped up to about 4.5 million when added and then jumped another time in the last week to 9.5 million. Seeing some solid utilization, 96%.  ETH/DAI chart1071\u00d7537 67.2 KB  DAI from ETH has been holding steady at 104/105 million.  USDC chart1049\u00d7540 50.5 KB   Dai from USDC; During the March event, it had 7.5 million of utilization. It came back down in April and was sitting fairly low until it was made significantly cheaper. Following some refinancing from Compound, it topped out around 11-13 million in early May.   Around the 20th, when a conversation about SF increases started, along with a decline in ETH price, we saw a large refinancing (possibly back to Compound) and a drop of about 3 million. Then some smaller drops in the last few days. USDC Dai supply has come down a little bit, but before the 24th, it was free money. Given the system parameters for liquidations, and that there appears to be short-term low volatility risk collateral type, it was desirable for people to be using this asset. And it still is very attractive, just likely less so. It would be interesting to watch how much utilization this gets and what causes it to change.   1068\u00d7505 43.8 KB   USDC Collateral supply much more stagnant than the Dai supply. Those using the USDC Dai pool don\u2019t move the amount of collateral much they just fluctuate Dai minted from it. They\u2019re comfortable keeping USDC parked and utilizing it more heavily when needed.   There was a $3 Million USDC dip in collateral on May 26-27.   1030\u00d7520 90.9 KB   To touch on the relative collateralization between different assets.  ETH has maintained a semi-trimodal collection of collateralization ratios. A decent chunk at 200-250, 300-350, and 500+ with smaller distributions for the interceding values. That coincides with the three main sections of liquidation walls you see(in the screenshot below.)    1064\u00d7352 34.2 KB   That represents multiple risk profiles embedded in the same asset.   As ETH diversifies into various risk profile offerings, as in multiple ETH Vault types, you\u2019ll see these walls get more uniform for each one. They\u2019ll segment out, and users will seek the Vault type that matches their risk profile the most.   There is a small wall at $138, so that is something to be aware of. A lot of users view it as the lowest risk scenario.   1036\u00d7544 97.6 KB  Not worth going into the collateralization for WBTC since movements are minimal.  1538\u00d7688 123 KB   For trading volume, similar to previous seven-day trading volumes.   Globally, this is still a low volume for seven days. Even though peg is functioning well, it\u2019s lower volumes than we have seen in the past. I would take my comments there with a grain of salt.   1058\u00d7525 76.4 KB   As far as USDC goes, chunks appear at 120-130 and 140-150% levels.   A chunk exists that is 20 points over-collateralized, people are keeping a bit of a buffer. Some wiped down USDC debt but still keeping USDC parked for when they need it.   1058\u00d7551 210 KB   In a 90-day time frame, though the prices were crazier, there was much more substantial volume in April and early May than we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks.   Thought the prices look better, it\u2019s good to keep trading volume in the back of our minds. What will be interesting to watch, in terms of Dai, is where some of these larger trades occur? Larger trades do encounter more slippage when there are lighter volumes. Some Uniswap trades went well below peg due to slippage and size. It moves averages more dramatically. Will look to add in some stuff for USDC Dai trades for next time, that would be good to look at.   Relevant Links MCD system stats DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Open Ended Open-ended Discussion 58:51 LFW MIP 13 and 14 recap   The main implication for both of these MIPs is that you could spend Dai from the Protocol via an executive vote. It\u2019s technically possible, but there has never been a clear process outlined for the community. We will now be able to spend Dai if we all vote for it, which, as Rich said, is a significant change.   Forum Thread for MIP13: Declarations of Intent   Forum Thread for MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer     MIP14 is a reasonably simple process. One can create a sub proposal with supporting information, including a receiving ETH address, that is then discussed and goes through the governance cycle. When it makes it to the executive, we can use this process to transfer Dai out of the Protocol to the specified address.   01:00:01   Cyrus: What do you think about Governance and Risk teams having discretionary accounts? Would there be a series of restrictions? Checks and balances before funds go out? It seems like it could be quite risky.   LFW: Ultimately, once we\u2019ve further explored these things, we can figure out what sorts of checks and balances would work. What checks or balances do we want to impose on ourselves? Through an executive, we can do whatever we want, ultimately MKR token holders can find someone as long as they want to.   LFW: I don\u2019t see the governance risk here as significantly different from any other governance risk. Part of the responsibility of MKR token holders is governing the Protocol responsibly. Part of that responsibility is to use the tools the Protocol has, like spending Dai, for its needs.     01:01:34   Sam: Is there spam protection for this? Or any thoughts on how to keep low-quality content from coming through?   LFW: Potentially. Spam has been considered in the MIPs process. This is why Gov facilitators get to gatekeep what goes into the inclusion poll. If too many are submitted, then we can determine \u201cok there\u2019s too many of low quality\u201d or \u201cok there\u2019s 10 or 15, and we just won\u2019t vote on them this week.\u201d Generalized, but potentially this MIP could include something about refunding to an address. There is no way to enforce that someone pays to post a MIP to the forum; there isn\u2019t smart contract logic that prevents people from posting whatever they want.   Sam: We probably don\u2019t need it yet. It could be a useful tool to consider eventually. Since money is attached, I just expect this to be a vector that might be spammed.   LFW: Presumably, the first part of a MIP is to post something on the forums. We could potentially have a social layer like \u201cburn this much Dai, or else we won\u2019t submit your proposal.\u201d   Sam: That\u2019s what I was thinking.   LFW: Something to preoptimize for.   Sam: Just a thought not necessary at this stage.     1:03:56   LFW: Daniel, in the chat, asks, \u201cIs there a clear example of what the community would want to spend DAi on immediately?\u201d   LFW: I imagine people haven\u2019t given much thought yet. The one glaring thing is the MKR holders vote to compensate vault holders who lost money on Black Thursday. If that\u2019s to be done, then money needs to come from somewhere. The Protocol is currently the only place.   LFW: There was some discussion about preventing Debt Auctions. If you pull Dai out of the Protocol when it has no surplus to support it, it triggers Debt Auctions that issue MKR and raise 50,000 Dai at a time. We could add a process to spread Dai payouts over time as a solution against MKR dilution.   Lev: Wouldn\u2019t it be reasonable that you don\u2019t just use this trigger for deficit spending? It sounds extreme to me to casually start minting MKR to pay for stuff.   LFW: I\u2019ve left it as generic as possible to avoid strict controls. For any specific proposal to mint MKR, you could imagine there will be extra scrutiny. The onus is on MKR token holders to pay attention to the MIPs process.   Lev: One could still see value in terms of setting expectations and set to spend out of the available surplus. You\u2019re not opening the door for anything to happen; you\u2019re opening it to spending the money that\u2019s been saved in ways we want.   LFW: Is there ever a situation of wanting to spend money we don\u2019t have? The question is, do you want to have a MIP process to specify that or not?   Lev: I agree with you, given that\u2019s a hard decision to plan for. It\u2019s challenging to make a process around it. Many people on this call would say we should NEVER do that, and others may be in favor depending on circumstance. There is a split about spending out of pocket versus the surplus. Spending the surplus is probably not controversial.     1:08:18   LFW: MIP13 is a little more involved. It allows Governance to declare that they want something to happen, basically setting up a bounty and the subprocess for fulfilling it.   LFW: Main criticisms have been that bounties are primitive(which I agree with.) There is no pay in advance for the first attempt at engaging with the work. It\u2019s very much, doing the work first and then get paid later if the client likes it.   There\u2019s a discussion to take the MIP \u201cas is\u201d or take it without the bounty parts. Or to go with the primitive bounty system and try to improve it later.   Feel free or leave comments in the forum thread.   1:10:00   Cyrus: Question for monetary policy and market makers. Dai price seems to be consistently just above $1. Is there a massive hidden bid that keeps it above a Dollar? It\u2019s been a few weeks hovering just above the dollar mark.   Sam: I would think the USDC buffer is blocking that.   Cyrus: That\u2019s what I think too. There aren\u2019t large resting bids on Coinbase. It seems like any medium-sized order would push the price below a dollar. It\u2019s not happening, so maybe it is USDC folks trying to cover. Curious to hear if market makers have any anecdotal thoughts on that.   Joe: I agree with that analysis.   Vishesh: It makes sense, considering so many people\u2019s inventories have been cleared in a month, they would look for opportunities to replenish. There have been two incidents where Dai got close to or dipped below a dollar; during both, Dai price snapped back. I would presume there is a fair amount of orders below a dollar waiting to replenish inventories.     01:12:53  Rich: That\u2019s the end of Q&A, and that was a cool call! Looking forward to the future with, the now, double capacity for Governance throughput on the facilitators. Thanks, Nik, Sam, Long, and everyone else who asked questions. Vishesh, as always, the graphs are a delight. Thanks, everyone!

Welcome to the July 16th edition of the Governance and Risk meeting, taking place on Thursday, July 16th at 4 PM UTC. I am LongForWisdom, one of the Governance Facilitator for MakerDAO, joined by all sorts of people with various levels of affiliation. We have a fairly full agenda this week.  Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:02   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussions   Negative DSR / TRFM  OliverNChalk begins a discussion and argues in favor of negative rates.    Turn ETH liquidations off until the peg is restored  bit suggests disabling ETH-A liquidations as a radical solution to fix the DAI peg. Most people prefer not to do that, but there was some debate around lowering the liquidation ratio.    What? So What? Now What? PSM Solution  FourthStreet writes up a summary of the pros and cons of PSM implementation, which I think are worth the read. We\u2019ve had a couple of good discussions.    Signal Requests   Should we raise the ETH debt ceiling?  Cyrus of the MakerDAO Risk Team asks if we should increase the ETH-A debt ceiling since we\u2019re nearing the ETH debt ceiling again.    TUSD Update (Forum Poll): Concerns Surrounding the TUSD Collateral Type  Lucas Manuel from the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts team asks how governance wishes to move forward with the TUSD collateral type considering the recent contract upgrades.    Adjust the ZRX and KNC Risk Premiums  monet-supply proposes decreasing the risk premiums for KNC and/or ZRX to make them more attractive, in the quest to emit more Dai.    Consider refinements to PSM or release ASAP?  Joshua_Pritikin asks whether the first version of the PSM should include some of the proposed improvements, or should be implemented without refinements. I think in general, people would prefer to release it sooner rather than try to build in something complicated initially.    Increase duration of governance security module?  Joshua_Pritikin asks whether we should increase the Governance Security Module delay to 24 hours to make it easier to defend against governance attacks.    Should MakerDAO signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers to be disabled?  equivrel (Lev) asks if Maker Governance should signal to Compound that we would prefer COMP rewards for DAI to be disabled. It\u2019s failed to pass, so we won\u2019t be recommending that.    MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 05:30 Title Slide1363\u00d7584 143 KB This Week1383\u00d7650 116 KB   To address the issues, we will need to have further conversations in the forum threads.   It makes sense that the MIP12 amendment didn\u2019t pass because it relates closely to MIP17 and incorporates some of the logic in having these reoccurring adjustments in place for MIP17. And that was for the actual debt ceiling and actual risk premium adjustments.   I\u2019ll follow up on my MIPs update later in the week, and we\u2019ll have to start more open conversations, hopefully in the MIPs rocketchat channel and the forums, about how we can get the best solution for both of these.   During the Governance Poll Review, likely only five of them will be moving forward.   Next Week1383\u00d7667 94.3 KB Other News1373\u00d7679 100 KB   Brian will be covering the smart contract assessment of both of these collateral types later in the call.   This month\u2019s greenlight polls are going live before as part of the amendment.   We\u2019ll see a bunch of collateral onboarding polls go up. I think for seven assets.   Other News 21377\u00d7682 86.6 KB   I do encourage anyone that hasn\u2019t checked MIP20 out yet, to do so in the forums an provide feedback and input.   I believe that a Declaration of Intent was proposed by Akiva, and he\u2019s working with other community members on it.   TUSD update: Lucas will be speaking about that as well.   Join the community1192\u00d7580 32.3 KB LongForWisdom Inclusion Review 10:42  As Charles said, there were seven MIPs and sub-proposals that went through last week.  MIPs   Passed: MIP16 - The Weekly Governance Cycle   Passed: MIP18 - Meta-Parameter Adjustments   Passed: MIP19 - Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade   Failed: MIP17 - Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling and Actual Risk Premium Adjustments   Sub-Proposals   Passed: MIP18c4-SP1 - Subproposal for Modifying Meta-Parameter Adjustments   Passed: MIP12c2-SP3 - Domain Work Requirements for the Onboarding of MANA   Failed: MIP4c2-SP5 - MIP12 Amendments  \u201cYes\u201d votes exceeded the \u201cNo\u201d votes, but without passing the threshold.    Risk LongForWisdom PSM Timeline 12:47 The PSM Governance Timeline - Forum Thread  As part of the governance timeline and plan for the Peg Stabilization Module(PSM), I mentioned there would be a chance to discuss this in the next few meetings. I don\u2019t think we can afford to spend the entire meeting to discuss it like last week, but we can give it about ten or fifteen minutes.  PSM Timeline - Next Steps   The PSM timeline that I shared on the forum states that there will be a poll on Monday about whether we want to implement the PSM in some form. This will be an on-chain governance poll.   The week after, there will be one or more governance polls that determine the parameters for the PSM implementation.   On the 31st or possibly the week after, which is on August 7th, we will have executive votes that will actually enable the PSM depending on the smart contract team\u2019s workload. It might be a good idea for Governance to start considering what parameters we would like to set.   PSM Parameters   Cyrus: Is there an overview of what the various parameters are that need to be considered for the PSM, or will there be one put out?   LongForWisdom: Yes, there is one. I added it to the PSM timeline post. We also have the option of implementing multiple copies of that with various parameters. For each PSM, there are these four parameters:   debt ceiling   fee-in   fee-out   token.       LongForWisdom: We can have a number of those parameters but shouldn\u2019t exceed more than five parameters because that would be a lot. I haven\u2019t thought too deeply about it yet, but do you have any thoughts about what possible settings you would want for these parameters?  Cyrus: No, we are going to start reviewing the spec and seeing what needs to be done, and hopefully, we will put out something over the next few days. Up to now, we are just waiting for the spec to finalize.    PSM - Sets of Parameters   LongForWisdom: One point is that because there are four parameters for each PSM, and there\u2019s a decision to be made about how many of these we will have, it is probably best to vote on the parameters in the form of sets. We have someone propose sets of parameters for a given PSM, and then we pick one out of a maximum of five sets, rather than voting on each parameter individually because that would get confusing (considering the fact that we can apply 1:N PSMs.) That is something I would consider. It\u2019s also why we probably won\u2019t be voting individually on parameters and instead be voting on a set of parameters or a strategy to follow with this implementation.   Cyrus: Yep, that makes sense.   Christopher Mooney: I want to say to take my silence as a complete agreement with the process that you guys will follow.   LongForWisdom: That\u2019s always nice to hear!     Smart Contracts Lucas Manuel TUSD Update 17:32  I\u2019m Lucas, on the Smart Contracts team. Over the last week, I was tasked with looking at the new TUSD implementation and whitelisting it. When I was reviewing the code, I found four main concerns if we choose to whitelist this new implementation.  Declaring Deposit Addresses  TUSD has functionality that enables them to declare deposit addresses. So if one address is declared as a deposit address for another, if you transfer TUSD tokens to that first address, it automatically gets routed to the second address. The issue with that is that if our Join adaptor for TUSD is declared as a deposit address, someone would be able to call join and the transfer from in that join, would forward the funds out of the Join adaptor. But our internal accounting system in the VAT would be convinced that there were TUSD tokens in the VAT. So it would compromise the internal accounting system of the VAT. People would be able to mint unbacked Dai because there would actually be no TUSD in the system. So that\u2019s a big concern.  TUSD Private Keys  If the TUSD private keys were to be hacked, the implementation could be changed to a malicious ERC20 implementation. A hacker could mint infinite TUSD and then actually change the ERC20 back to the whitelisted implementation. They could then use this unbacked TUSD to enter a vault and mint, through proxy, unbacked Dai. Also a concern for us.  Frozen Period while on Review  Every time the TUSD team upgrades their smart contract, the Smart Contracts team has to review the new code and whitelist that implementation before anyone is able to exit their vault positions. So in between the time that a smart contract is upgraded and we have reviewed it, the TUSD funds on the Protocol are frozen. Due to the fact that this TUSD is about 20 times the size of an average ERC20 token implementation, it takes a very long time to review. If there were multiple upgrades per year, this could be a big-time suck on the Smart Contracts team.  Diminishing Returns of Reviewing an Upgradeable Token  TUSD is currently is the only collateral type in the Maker Protocol, which is upgrade-able. We\u2019re concerned that this token could lead to diminishing returns because time would be taken away from the Smart Contracts team to review and onboard new collateral types and adding them to the collateral portfolio to maintain this existing collateral type. We said that this would be worth it if it was a more valuable collateral type, such as wBTC, something that provides revenue for the protocol and has a high amount of utilization. But TUSD has a low stability fee and a low debt ceiling. The amount of benefit for the amount of work seems to be leading to diminishing returns.  Vote on the Forum Poll  I posted a forum poll yesterday, it\u2019s going to be up for seven days. Next Wednesday, we\u2019ll finish up the forum poll and move forward from there to an on-chain ranked-choice poll. I encourage everyone to vote.  Discussion 1 TUSD Upgrades Frequency 22:18   LongForWisdom: Have we had any contact with the TUSD team about the upgrades, and how frequent they will be?   Lucas Manuel: They said that for sure, they will be upgrading again by the end of the year, but outside of that, we don\u2019t know.   Christopher Mooney: I\u2019ll add that their team was super cooperative and very helpful with us as well. Their engineering team seems to be great.     Implementation Upgradeability   Lev Livnev: If I understand correctly, for TUSD right now, we\u2019re using the GemJoin5 adaptor, which that doesn\u2019t have this implementation pinning feature the GemJoin6 does. Even though USDC, just like  TUSD, uses the same implementation proxy pattern. I assume this is because USDC was added on an accelerated timeline, but it\u2019s worth noting that, in principle, the same concerns apply. Also, in principle, we may want to be using the GemJoin6 pattern for USDC as well.  Mariano Conti: You\u2019re correct on both counts. It was added quickly, so we didn\u2019t have the Join adapter with the implementation. We\u2019re looking at it for the PSM. But even then, for example, USDC, the implementation is a small sub-contained standard ERC20. TUSD, on the other hand, has been upgraded at least three or four times this year alone. Every time, it keeps adding new code to review. What we\u2019ve heard from the TUSD team is that, at least for now, they don\u2019t plan to do any upgrades. They have also mentioned that, if possible, they would let us know beforehand. But I do agree that it should also have the GemJoin6 or something similar.    Moving Adaptors   LFW: Is it easy to move from the current adaptor to a new adaptor?  Mariano Conti: It is more complicated. If the PSM ends up being something obsolete, the USDC-A, for example, we could see it go organically go from one to the other. Otherwise, we would probably need some kind of plan. We can discuss this in a future call.    Some Features of the Tokens  Brian McMichael: We did look over the contract. Currently, it\u2019s got the ERC20 implementation in there, and they also have a blacklist, a rewards program, they have implemented their own gas refund component to the token. There\u2019s the forwarding that was mentioned, as well. Those are things that come to mind. Some of this stuff could have probably been done in a more modular way, but they have put it all into the token, and it means we have to review it all when we go through it.  Feedback to the TUSD Team about Modular Design 26:48   Lev Livnev: Not that it matters so much for us, but has someone given the feedback that because this over-engineered upgradeable implementation potentially we\u2019re going to end up having to drop this token because it\u2019s not worth the effort reviewing it all the time? It just seems that this wasn\u2019t the greatest decision on their part.   Christopher Mooney: I\u2019ve raised some of these concerns in the forum threads, hoping that they get a chance to read that. The nice thing is that their token is upgradeable so they could upgrade and fork all that stuff out and maybe make the design more modular.   Cyrus Younessi: That discussion has been floating around in quite a few places.     Forum Poll Options   LongForWisdom: Just to summarize the three options of the poll, they are:   Approve this new implementation of TUSD with the same risk parameters.   Approve this new implementation of TUSD with different risk parameters.   Set the debt ceiling of TUSD to zero.     Lucas Manuel: We chose to propose the idea of setting the debt ceiling to zero because, if they do upgrade the smart contract in the future to be simpler and easier to review, we would be happy to onboard it back. This would allow the people that have their funds in the vault right now to be able to exit while not allowing any new vaults to be opened with TUSD for the time being.   Silver Linings   Christopher Mooney: We were lucky this time that users didn\u2019t have a bunch of TUSD locked in the protocol. I think one of the engineers has. There would have been a lot of complaining and user pressure to quickly approve the new implementation; otherwise, that would have added a whole social component to this.   Mariano Conti: Also, this collateral type has no liquidations activated, so you can imagine if the did have liquidations, and for some reason, they upgrade the token, and nobody can join in anymore, and the price is dropping, and things like that. These things help for future collateral types but may end up in this situation as well.   Transferring the Trust from the Code to the Team  Chris Mooney in the chat: In the context of trust but verify, upgradability basically removes the ability to \u201cverify\u201d a contract by breaking code immutability. IMHO, any upgradable contract, reduces back down to how well one can \u201ctrust\u201d the team that manages the keys. All upgradable collaterals should be thought of in this paradigm when thinking about monetary and technical risk.  Governance Derek Flossman Governance Chief Contract Redesign 30:25 Intro Slide1361\u00d7442 76 KB   I\u2019m Derek from the Product team. Over the last weeks or months, I\u2019ve been working with the Smart Contracts team on coming up with a redesign of the Governance Chief Contract. So I\u2019m going to provide a summary of a recent forum post.   I\u2019ll go over the definition of Chief, a bit about the problems, the goals of this initiative, and the key concepts and features that are a part of it. Also, try to provide an indicative timeline.   I have flagged the Chief Redesign External channel, so feel free to ping myself or LongForWisdom. We\u2019d love to have more people participating in the discussion around some of these features. I welcome you all.   101 Refresher - DSChief and its Scope1349\u00d7723 170 KB   Changes can mean:   DSR   Stability Fee   Oracle changes   Collateral changes   Process and protocol changes     There\u2019s also a bunch of technical stuff that the DSChief includes in regards to its interaction with the Chief Approvals. I won\u2019t go into details, but I\u2019m happy to break this out into a more formal structure in the post with the help of the Smart Contracts team if we\u2019d like to get into that detail.   DSChief Problem Space1341\u00d7738 232 KB   I will attach the presentation to the forum post.   The example on the bottom right shows an example of the recent MKR distribution between different proposals.   The Goal - Security and Usability1417\u00d7679 106 KB   We haven\u2019t spoken about it, but there\u2019s an opportunity to use the wrapper, making it a lot more efficient and work with the token.   There may be trade-offs depending on how the system is designed.   Proposed Redesign1340\u00d7322 57.3 KB Threshold and Minimum Quorum1394\u00d7738 169 KB Threshold and Minimum Quorum - Real Numbers1394\u00d7737 207 KB   If we take the model and put it on the actual executive proposals this year, we see that we\u2019re actually split between 50,000 and 100,000 MKR.   It looks like the beginning of June was our highest. Just over 100,000 MKR participating.   We need to take the theory, analyze it, plot it against the actual MKR participation, and make sure we have something that introduces security without locking the system.   Other Key Concepts &amp; Features1189\u00d7719 132 KB  We also need to consider gas costs and optimize for that as well.  Other Key Concepts &amp; Features - 21330\u00d7730 103 KB   Spell Creation Bond may be very useful from a future-proof point of view.   My plan will be for the formal MIP to have a list of all the values that we need to decide on, probably in a tabular format, and we can just work through them and make sure that it aligns with everyone\u2019s view.   We might need more discussion on Pause Support, but I wanted to include it.   Indicative Q3 Next Steps1390\u00d7642 147 KB   The first phase is where we are now.   I haven\u2019t elaborated on the coordination migration plan here. However, it\u2019s quite important, since there\u2019s a migration risk at this time, the same we mentioned earlier in the presentation.

Looking forward to being able to get rid of bundling the unrelated changes together in the voting cycle. One thing I would like to mention is that this new Chief gives us the opportunity of modifying how the monthly governance cycle works to make it more efficient. That\u2019s another possible benefit of this.  Delegation   MakerMan in the chat: Any concept of delegation in this?  Meaning having one wallet pass MKR deposited to do something to another wallet to actually do it?  Or are we always going to require a wallet putting up the MKR to do the action?  Derek: A lot of people are interested in delegation, and we started looking into that we found that the Chief Contract we have today wasn\u2019t optimal, and if we were to do delegation with what we have, we would have to redo it once we did the new Chief. So how much delegation we will be able to roll into this? I\u2019m not sure. I think our approach will be to optimize the Chief Wrapper to enable us to do delegation. But that will be a separate, not core set of contracts. I\u2019ll leave it at that because at this point in time I don\u2019t know. But I will work to do the delegation document, and I think that will be the next one we will put out there for the Community to take a look at. I\u2019ll try to get it out in a couple of weeks and make sure everything aligns.    Brian McMichael MANA and LEND Smart Contracts Evaluation 48:56  This is the Smart Contracts technical presentation on MANA and LEND, and I do have pretty good news.  1388\u00d7745 244 KB   MANA is an ERC20 token.   It follows standard ERC20 patterns.   It\u2019s not upgradeable, so we would be able to use it with the GemJoin adaptor with this, which is the standard adaptor we use for BAT.   There\u2019s a mint function, which is mintable by the Crowdsale contract. However, the Crowdsale contract has been self-destructed. So the total supply for MANA is the current max supply.   There was an audit done by OpenZeppelin, and the team has given this one a low-risk assessment.   MANA - Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation - Forum Thread   1382\u00d7730 228 KB   It\u2019s also a very low risk, basic, ERC20 token.   Non-upgradeable.   It can also use the GemJoin adaptor.   The only non-standard feature we found in this one is that the decimals return a uint256 instead of a uint8. Which doesn\u2019t really affect our adaptors.   This does have mint functions as well. However, there\u2019s a state machine built into the contract such that the coin is only mintable in the presale or ICO state, and we can\u2019t go back from there.   There\u2019s also an audit done by Victor Mezrin, and that was approved for MainNet.   LEND - Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation - Forum Thread   Risk Vishesh Relevant Links MCD System Stats DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs Maker Vault Stats The State of the Peg 52:15 Overview912\u00d7408 139 KB   Dai from ETH has grown to 154 million Dai out of 160 million debt ceiling.   Total dai at $198 million.   ETH-A &lt;&gt; Dai Supply1090\u00d7530 61.3 KB  A few significant mints over the last couple weeks, where it ballooned from 114 million to 154 million.  USDC-A &lt;&gt; Dai Supply1100\u00d7538 49.5 KB  USDC-A roughly 19 million Dai jump issued since July 1st. Primarily one to two large users. We saw it grow from then.  WBTC-A &lt;&gt; Dai Supply1107\u00d7535 28.2 KB  After the initial 10 million steady-state utilization, it increased pretty really quickly to 20 million after the DC was increased.  BAT-A &lt;&gt; Dai Supply1099\u00d7544 56.3 KB  A significant dip in BAT after the March 12th events, and then another dip on July 1st timeline. As we all know, a few weeks ago, Compound Farming activity began, which impacted the Dai ecosystem in a significant way.  Table Supply Borrow812\u00d7506 101 KB   We see a significant amount of Dai being supplied in Compound. Obviously, there\u2019s a significant amount of borrow, but given the nature of the re-wrapping, the biggest net impact here is the additional 85 million Dai sitting as reserves. For other assets such as USDC and ETH, there\u2019s an even larger buffer in the amount that\u2019s supplied versus the amount borrowed.   Given the nature of profitability of the different types of farming behaviors with various projected stabilities and yields, those are being used as collateral effectively for other borrowing behaviors on Compound.   That margin of the amount of Dai being borrowed versus supplied on a percentage basis is much smaller than other assets.   Compound Loans Originated822\u00d7435 69.3 KB  In the last week or so, about $300 million in nominal borrow of Dai happened on Compound. That doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the amount of net borrow increase. That\u2019s a distinction that we can touch on. The method of accounting for borrow and supply leads to virtual borrow interest that is effectively achieving a more aggressive CR. For the amounts of loans outstanding, that\u2019s a large looking number at around 800 million. But given that Dai supply outstanding is 154 million from ETH and another 40 or so million from a couple of other assets, we\u2019re looking at a total of about 190 some million Dai issued there, and 88 million of that Dai is in the DSR(because of Compound.)  Table Supply Borrow812\u00d7506 101 KB   Net you\u2019re looking at 100 million Dai floating out there, and you\u2019ve got an excess supply in Compound of 85 million Dai.   So that\u2019s a pretty significant chunk of the Dai supplied floating out there that is currently sitting on Compound as supplied assets. That\u2019s something to be aware of, as movements in this pool of Dai could have significant impacts.   Debt Collateral Charts1107\u00d7407 78.9 KB  We have seen an increase in positions living at the lower collateralization Ratios, which is more risk to be aware of and how to go about handling and managing that risk.  Projected Dai liquidated1097\u00d7316 46.1 KB   Even at an ETH price of $170, you\u2019d be looking at 30 million Dai liquidated.   At $150, you\u2019d be looking at a total projected Dai liquidated of about 70 million.   Those are pretty significant amounts, and those are not completely unrealistic potential price drops for ETH.   ETH price drop1283\u00d7601 240 KB   The ETH price is already falling a bit down to $235-ish. During the last week, the ETH has been falling, and the Dai price has stayed consistently at what a lot of people call an elevated level, around $1.02. In the grand scheme of things, this is a legitimate elevated Dai price.   Earlier in June, we saw Dai fluctuating between 1.00 and 1.01. Around the beginning of July, we saw the Dai price rise and sit at 1.02, and since then, it\u2019s come down a little bit.   In the past, the peg was mainly driven by ETH price movements. It\u2019s not 100% clear whether ETH price is driving what happens with the Dai peg.   Chart last week1089\u00d7427 121 KB   Some of the fluctuations in ETH price would historically produce different effects on what\u2019s going on with the Dai price.   When ETH started to fall from $246-ish to around $239, the Dai price did rise a little bit. But since July 13th or so, as the ETH price was coming down, you did not see a commensurate rise in the Dai price, it actually fell a little bit. That was a bit contrary to what we usually see. It\u2019s important to think about all this external ecosystem around Dai and how it\u2019s impacting supply and demand.   With just the significant amount of increase in supply, particularly in ETH-Dai supply in the last two weeks, it makes sense to consider that there is a portion that\u2019s been supplied on Compound, but also a decent amount that probably made its way onto the market in terms of selling pressure.   All that minting is at a very low cost, so there are very few barriers at the moment for people looking to lever up, mint Dai, sell it, or use USDC vaults, despite cap on DC, for getting free hedge positions. If you look at a vault with USDC, where liquidations are not enabled at the moment, it\u2019s a pretty low-risk option for minting and engaging in multiple different kinds of yield-seeking behavior. COMP farming is just one example, but there are plenty of others.   Discussion 3 USDC-A Debt Ceiling Not in Use 1:04:21  Vishesh: The USDC-A DC was raised. There\u2019s the potential for that minting behavior. When we were looking back on July 1st, there was an immediate utilization of the amount of the available DC. That hasn\u2019t jumped again to cap out the \u201cincreased leash.\u201d It\u2019s worth considering to see if the potential for utilization is still there. A few large users drove a huge chunk of that utilization. Whether we expect to see if another large user comes in and uses the remaining DC, how do we want to handle it? Sam suggested lowering the base rate. There\u2019s a conversation to be had there.  Some Risks of USDC and its Concerns  Vishesh: If you\u2019re providing low-cost routes for minting Dai and getting access to a lower risk capital position and then using it for higher-risk higher-yield activities, there is a question of how low you want to make the rates to incentivize that, versus accounting for the risk that you\u2019re inherently underwriting by facilitating this behavior. We\u2019ve looked at the MKR-ETH collateralization ratio, and most people have nestled on the USDC collateral positions being a lower risk pool. It\u2019s always something to keep aware of, that as the pool grows, the risk becomes different. It\u2019s not necessarily a market risk. Given that liquidations aren\u2019t currently enabled, we don\u2019t see too many people concerned with that USDC collateral pool.  USDC Stability Fee   Vishesh: There are independent threads on how the fees are being managed and when the ceilings are moved. MakerMan is suggesting a more comprehensive conversation on that. I\u2019m not sure what exactly you would do differently. Right now, it\u2019s not been a risk-driven conversation on what the Stability Fees are, but more on the levels at which you incentivize different behaviors. The DCs appear to be moved when you need more slack. It\u2019s not necessarily the wrong way to manage that, just stylistic. I don\u2019t know if you would change the narrative of how to choose to set those DCs. Right now, it seems to be that when you want to incentivize more utilization, you provide more slack and when it\u2019s not being used, you lower the SFs.   Vishesh: That\u2019s the suggestion in the chat about the USDC Stability Fee. That\u2019s a conversation to be had with the community. Not sure if I would be able to comment on that right here or now.   Risk, Peg, and Parameters  Makerman: I haven\u2019t posted on this. We are taking on risk, though. I don\u2019t have a good vault analysis tool to look at why we have these big numbers of liquidations that have higher risk points. I think it\u2019s just bigger players taking on farming risks and using their ETH to do it. You\u2019d like to raise fees to capture some of these farming activities to mitigate the risk. You do that, and the peg might go up, you put more strain on it. Literally, half of available Dai is stuck in the DSR via Compound. Do you want to take on the risk behavior? I honestly don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if anyone knows. But it\u2019s kind of the real question here. If the peg is number one, and three out of four people say peg is a big deal, including Rune, then everything else isn\u2019t as important. I don\u2019t have a good feeling about that, but it has implications for stretching other things. If we\u2019re going to only grow Dai by growing assets, you have to think about how to do that. We have three key players. Unfortunately, we have two more on top of ETH: USDC and WBTC. WBTC wants more. We could raise the rate while we raise the DC and see if they take it again. USDC-A, if we want to help that, we got to come down on rate. Do we want to coordinate and try to get another 50 million to touch this risk and have risk behavior, and when the Compound thing switches, it\u2019s going to switch hard and fast. The big money is going to move out of this, and we will have to step it up. Fortunately, we have a lot of good tools to do that. I just don\u2019t know how we do the coordinated thing. I\u2019d love to hear from Vishesh, Cyrus, Christopher Mooney, Rune, and others, about all the implications on what we do and when.  Consider the Lifecycle of the Dai and Market Fundamentals 1:11:36  Vishesh: One thing to keep in mind is that increasing supply only impacts the peg when users are willing to mint that dai and sell it on the open market. That\u2019s an important part of the conversation, for the types of supply created are fragmented into multiple use cases. You have to consider what is the end use-case and what is the path to removal from circulation for every marginal Dai that\u2019s created. Is it being created just to lock on Compound, is it being created to be sold for something else? Considering the lifecycle of that Dai is a little bit missing, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that if the goal is bringing down the peg, you have to target use cases of Dai that will put more liquidity on the open market and help drive that price down. You also have to think if that\u2019s something that will happen at this point in time, if there are other market conditions or smart contract-driven fundamentals that are putting a premium on Dai that makes Dai worth more than 1 USDC. That\u2019s another important part of the conversation that is being under-discussed. For peg management, increasing supply is not 100% equivalent to driving down the peg. It only works when that supply makes it way onto the open market.  Multiple Tiers of ETH to Discover Risk Appetite   Christopher Mooney: Let\u2019s imagine the peg was at 1. We would all be concerned with the amount of risk building up. Just a month ago, we were looking at that histogram where liquidation ratios wherein the 500%-600% range. We had a lot of people that were risk-off because of Black Thursday and the overall macroeconomic sentiment. COMP has incentivized ETH-A collateral holders to go risk on. They\u2019re pushing towards lower bounds where liquidations are extremely risky. And thanks for calling that out, Vishesh. If we were at peg right now, we would probably want to suggest multiple ETH collateral types, where the effective 0% SF would be reserved for something that had a liquidation of maybe 300% or something that pushes people to have a higher CR. Maybe we need multiple tiers at this point for ETH. Naturally, people that want the lower rate that have higher liquidation ratios are going to move into those other tiers, and we start to get a good idea on who\u2019s \u201crisk-on,\u201d and how much would we have to liquidate of those people. Maybe not ideal.  MakerMan: I agree with that. We\u2019re coming to \u201cmore tools better.\u201d The idea of having multiple tiers of the same thing: why do that? It\u2019s to manage risk by setting the liquidation ratio. Also, to understand where the money and risk spread out on a spectrum. The best bottom one will always be taken for the longer haul, but the higher risk stuff, to see where it\u2019s landing, collect some fees, deal with the risk by having liquidation ratios managed, I think it\u2019s all a plus. We should do a MIP on it actually and have it as part of the Protocol. Not just one, but a couple of tiers in each of them. We could pick the ones that are working right now, like ETH, and maybe WBTC, and USDC-A.    Subsidizing USDC-A and the Base Rate 1:17:04  Sam MacPherson: As Vishesh said, we should maybe consider lowering the base rate to a negative value to encourage more supply coming from USDC-A. It shot up pretty quickly when we were at 0%. And now it\u2019s staying flat. That\u2019s more Dai that we could bring to fill this COMP-driven demand. I think we need to fill it in whatever way we can. We can\u2019t be too concerned about recouping risk premiums because we\u2019re in a really hard place right now, and we need to subsidize it through MKR. I don\u2019t think we have a choice.  Liquidity into COMP   MakerMan: I really want to re-echo what Vishesh said. We\u2019re taking on risk here, so keep in mind how we\u2019re managing this. I like the idea of getting fees out of different tiers to deal with taking on these risks. If these markets will do it, I would rather do it that way. ETH-A as it sits right now, those are our core people. We could add another at 1% or 2% for all the new people that want to take their ETH and cycle in. We have probably missed out on 50 million worth of ETH that would have paid us 1% or 2% to have access to a facility with lower ratios. When people that are in the \u201cgood facility\u201d leave, that money will jump there. There\u2019s a real issue with how we manage this. It\u2019s still the same point: You would like to get some fees but anything you try to collect, is it going to affect the peg?   They\u2019re progressively eating up liquidity. If you graph the USDC supply and borrow, it keeps going up slowly. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s new money turning up into the bigger accounts. We can add liquidity, but if it gets buried somewhere, it\u2019s not going to do anything to the peg. How do we deal with the peg in the face of COMP farming? You can throw 50 million at this, and the peg doesn\u2019t even flinch until the COMP thing changes. Throw 500 million Dai at it, maybe it changes. I see it as a blessing in disguise, as it makes us think about the size of the market. Everyone wants to grow, and we can determine how we should grow. This demand could come from anywhere. Any time and any amount. Other places could pull the same trick and make Dai the big deal.   Market Making and System Risks   Vishesh: You can continue to increase the supply of an asset, but it\u2019s not going to impact the peg unless users are willing to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to mint, sell and relinquish the Dai above peg, and I\u2019m ok with maintaining the risk and the fees, in exchange for that short-term profit.\u201d Unless you have that market-making behavior, that arbitrage behavior, you\u2019re not doing anything to the peg by increasing supply. That\u2019s a really important point that\u2019s completely overlooked because people in their minds think \u201cmore supply, lower price,\u201d but we\u2019re missing the Rube Goldberg in-between that gets you there. Everyone is focused on the peg, and we tend to overlook system-level risk, and I showed earlier that it\u2019s growing. Not just in percentage terms, but also in total dollar terms. How much of that nominal risk can and should MKR be able to underwrite?  Sam MacPherson: COMP farming will not lower the price of the Dai peg, but it removes upward pressure.    Outro LongForWisdom Closing Comments 1:12:14  LFW: Fantastic discussion around the peg and the current issues facing us. I encourage everyone to continue the discussion in the forums. I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, and I say this every week, but that\u2019s where governance happens. I would love to see this discussed in more detail. Specifically, more concrete proposals about what we could or should do.  Vault Compensation Plan   MakerMan: We have a quandary with 95k MKR voting to say yes, and now we have 45K MKR saying no. It\u2019s unclear for me what to do about it and I\u2019m leaving it as a quandary for the Community to handle. I encourage everyone to speak up on that.  LFW: Another thing we should address in the future. See you all next week.

DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Interim Governance Facilitator 09:20   Read more about the role here  The role of the Governance Facilitator already exists, but is not formally defined. Currently, Rich is living in this role that involves moderating and facilitating Maker Governance. This is a proposal that formalizes a detailed individual role. The community must decide if it agrees with the way the role is described. This will be discussed on the forums and polled for there initially. As part of the greater roadmap, the introduction of this role is meant to formalize it in the eyes of Maker governance. We need to formalize roles to make sure the Governance Community can live on in the absence of facilitation by members of the Maker Foundation. Interim Governance Facilitators (IGFs) are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling, and more. Primary Responsibilities:  Ownership and Management of the Official Communications Channels: Setting tone, removing trolls, surfacing conversations, etc. Defining the Governance \u2018Problem Space\u2019: detailing and helping the community to tackle the hard problems Making sure Governance is following the community mandated procedures   The Maker Foundation wants to community to come in and assume these roles and give feedback on what needs to be changed. If the community doesn\u2019t step in, the Foundation will end up leading the way in how these things are defined. Campaigning, advocating, and recruiting for this open Governance community is important for this very reason.  Questions   19:20: Since posting the thread, what has been the main concern or criticism?  Main concern is that there is a lot packed into the role. Voting for all of that or none of that might be jarring. We want to identify the specific problemed points if the community spots any. Lack of clarity about what the term \u201cratified\u201d means, since we haven\u2019t gone through the process of ratifying something like a risk team. It references processes that haven\u2019t been defined yet.    23:13: What problem does this role solve?  This is primarily about bootstrapping. We need a Governance Facilitator to keep the different aspects of Governance in-line with the structure we are creating for ourselves. Without a facilitator it is very hard to be organized.    29:44: Do we expect this to be a permanent role? Or is it part of some bootstrapping phase?  I can\u2019t say. It can happen that in a few years the community has worked out that the role is no longer necessary.    30:48: How does Governance move forward if the Governance Facilitator gets sick or something. How do we ensure coverage?  This a question for the Governance Facilitator to figure out. This is part of defining the \u2018problem space\u2019.    35:29: Is there compensation for this role, or is it purely voluntary?  We are in a transition phase for MakerDAO, and this will be a question for each mandated role. Until we have a more clearly defined mechanism for disbursement of proceeds from Stability Fees, everything is going to be covered by the Foundation itself. We hope that post-MCD launch we will have these mechanisms in place.    LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 39:33   Governance at a Glance Thread  Some random thoughts and concerns  IAmMeoh shares some feedback and concerns about the lack of apparent progress made by the Foundation towards MCD and how the Governance and Risk calls are formatted.    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  A new poll has been launched to determine which of the four options the community favors.    Consensus Decision Making vs Plurality Voting  Considering the difference between plurality and consensus decision making. How do we make decisions? How should we make decisions in the future? We will dig into this next week!    Risk Primoz Do falling collateral amounts in DeFi mean bearishness?(No) 42:48   Research based off the question found in this tweet   Associated article by Primoz I wanted to show that DeFi is actually at an all-time-high. The \u201camount locked in DeFi\u201d metrics are representative of risk, but not of actual usage of DeFi services. Median amount of ETH locked in CDPs is a better metric than overall, since it filters out individual whale activity which is outsized compared to the rest of the usage. Loans outstanding in DeFi are at an all-time-high  lDH6FY3.png998\u00d7454 38.4 KB   If you want to measure DeFi usage, its metrics like these that you need to look at, not the amount of collateral locked. If you want to measure usage of Dai, that\u2019s a completely different story. You want to focus on actual on-chain activity of Dai. There is a difference between nominal ETH amounts versus dollar value of underlying collateral locked up.  51:21: Cyrus - The takeaway is that if you want to measure the growth of the DeFi space you want to try to isolate metrics or use metrics that better isolate usership and growth. Collateral value itself is subject to unrelated factors like asset price and whales moving outsized amounts of collateral.  56:05: Additional commentary from Vishesh  Vishesh: Dai Analytics 54:51  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Dai Price: 54:51   The state of the peg is broadly good. There\u2019s been a huge trading volume over the last couple of days. Most trades were just above or just below a dollar. The Volume Weighted Average Price has been slightly above a dollar. A big portion of this was selling of ETH for Dai, which tends to stabilize the Dai price. Some of this volume was a result of nearly 1MM in liquidations in the past 24hrs.  Dai Supply: 56:53   The Dai supply has been relatively stable at around 77-78MM. The question is, \u201cis Dai losing market-share?\u201d  Continues answer in the context of Secondary Lending Platforms.    Secondary Lending Platforms: 57:35   Dai borrow volume has come up, but so has the excess. We saw a cratering of the excess from July to August, as a result of the InstaDapp Compound bridge. It has since bounced back. Utilization rate has come down with the Dai supply. This shows us that there is less demand for leverage, and therefore Dai. The question is, \u201cis this being caused by Compound? USDC?\u201d. Not necessarily. I think it\u2019s a function of ETH price right now more than anything. This should improve since as ETH price gets cheaper we will see an increase in leverage on ETH. On-chain Dai volume has remained very strong, as mentioned by Primoz, so it is being used. The supply drop seems to be the closing of leveraged long positions by a portion of the market. What\u2019s interesting is what MakerDAO will do with the rates. We see the SLP borrow rates have come back down, in tandem with a lowering utilization rate. So now there is a bit more excess that exists on SLPs.  Governance could try to lower the Stability Fee in an effort to make leverage look more attractive now. With Dai\u2019s consistent stability, it may have the room to accept a slightly lowered Stability Fee.   As the spread between SLP borrow rates and the SF widen you will see more oversupply captured in the form of excess liquidity not being actively lent out.  Questions to Vishesh + Post-Call Discussion   01:02:09: Is it possible for us to see a 7-day Volume Weighted Average price for these calls?  Yes, I have this metric: 1.004  0LPZSIp.png1180\u00d7435 194 KB      01:02:34: One of the questions we\u2019ve been pondering is when have we reached the point of harmony between Dai supply and demand?  01:13:02: If more Dai made it onto the market, would there be a demand for it?  01:19:15: Discussion around DSR, Risk Premium, and the methodology for starting DSR values.  01:21:10: Discussion around the calendar proposed in the Interim Governance Facilitator Thread   Links from the Chat  Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph  ",

We\u2019ll have a reasonably low-key intro into the new year and do our best to get back up to date.   SamM, community rockstar, will talk about the DSR spread and MakerDAO\u2019s governance model. He began this conversation a month ago on the forums.   Cyrus will speak about the Migration.   Vishesh will speak on the State of the Pegs.     We have an unusual situation with the GSM. An article went up on Medium about a potential exploit that sparked some passionate public conversation. In summary:   Anyone with a significant amount of money could co-opt the governance process. This attack isn\u2019t particularly threatening, as any organization with stock or crypto governance project has the same worry. Fortunately, this concern was in the white paper from the beginning.   The response to this type of threat was the Governance Security Module(GSM) that would impose a time delay on any governance actions. There was a rally of MKR holders, approximately 130k of MKR, was being staked on the existing Executive Vote, securing the system. Which is an amazing show of strength for the ecosystem. I don\u2019t want to get the details incorrect, but I saw somewhere that it was the largest amount of MKR staked on an executive.   The execution got weird, however.   The secured executive significantly raised the bar to pass the GSM adjustment. There are several lessons here in a  war between urgency and apathy, and how rapidly they can trade places in this space. It reminds me of Devcon, where we stopped voting because everyone was in Japan.   Perhaps the GSM was not timed well with the end of the year. We had a healthy active Executive with 100k+ MKR staked, and the GSM Executive Vote proposed to secure the system even more. The GSM vote didn\u2019t pass. Now what? Ideally, we can discuss how to mitigate governance issues, or issues resembling this situation in the future.     We keep running into planned ecosystem management versus the real world. Continuous approval voting served us well in SCD, but let\u2019s look at this new world we inhabit.  Another essential question: does the community want the GSM? The conversation got a lot more nuanced on the forums since there are tradeoffs that the article didn\u2019t do well at highlighting.    Join us, as always, in the FORUM to discuss.   Questions and Discussion 07:23   David: I think everyone recognizes the legitimacy of the reasoning for a zero delay period at this stage, but since the system is so new, we didn\u2019t convince holders that this is the appropriate time to set a non-zero delay. The trade-off is important to consider. Since the attack risk was an edge case, it might not have sparked too much urgency in MKR holders.  Rich: Good point, I noticed urgency and apathy are the two ends of the spectrum. The vote brought up agility vs. security and how to handle those trade-offs. Over the week, the debate got more nuanced, which is always great to see. Maybe the community thought the GSM just wasn\u2019t a good idea.    09:23   David: Should it be re-polled? Or re-voted on in the next vote?   Rich: It\u2019s not for us to say since this is a community lead initiative. Maybe the urgency was misplaced.   Mariano Conti: I would say there were trying circumstances around that poll. My recommendation would be to poll again sometime soon. The smart contracts are there, and it\u2019s in the white paper. The idea is to have the GSM delay sooner, rather than later. Not sure about the best timing. 0 delay forever is not in our best interest.   Cyrus: Did anyone check the vote stats? Distribution of voters in the portal? We might have had community consensus, but a few larger holders didn\u2019t follow through. It\u2019s possible the will of the community didn\u2019t align with larger MKR holders.   Rich: We\u2019re opening a barrel of worms since we haven\u2019t defined what the community really is. I tend to overlap voters and community members in the forum with those who actually vote. I\u2019m not sure the distinction I have is what everyone else notices.   Matthew: The foundation can\u2019t say \u201cwe will do this,\u201d but could they or the risk teams, at least, present a recommendation? I think this is a theme we\u2019re going to come back to frequently now. Needing a recommendation.   Rich: Agree, I keep coming back to that too. We have this amorphous group with plenty of ideas. Ideas need to surface with ownership and a campaign behind them. Expecting these thoughts to organically emerge and have enough stickiness to move governance on their own may be na\u00efve. We haven\u2019t seen enough examples of that. The question becomes:   Does the community continue with empowering actors? At a certain point, we\u2019re going to need legal opinions and have to publish these. Who will do that is, again, another question.   The GSM is a thing, and we saw a peak and valley of sentiment and engagement. It followed the tail of social media, everyone was furiously upset, and then two weeks later, they found something else to worry about. How do we make sure that we don\u2019t lose the thread on threats to the protocol? How do we resurface what matters? My preference here is a forum thread accompanied by a vote.       17:08   Richard Burton: \u201cProtocol politicians are going to be interesting.\u201d  Rich: This is something I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while. More people get engaged as the stakes get higher. To connect to a point earlier: who is willing to campaign for which ideas? I look forward to a future where people self-organize and coordinate around an issue, E.G., a higher or lower DSR. Potentially using some tooling to make sure their votes are accurate.    18:13   Cyrus: Instead of doing a one time fix for the GSM. E.G., another executive. Maybe we should put together a process for votes that don\u2019t pass? We could rerun the executive or rerun the governance poll and then the executive. Something so we don\u2019t continue to cycle issues.   Rich: Like poking the poll?   Cyrus: Yes, a generic or general process to these situations.   Matthew: We should be careful. Might have been merely timing around the holidays, it\u2019s not the best to keep surfacing the vote. We should avoid a narrative that is \u201cpeople wanted to do it, but they didn\u2019t get the chance to.\u201d When the underlying scenario is that the vote should have been a \u2018no.\u2019   Rich: Right.   Cyrus: That should all be surfaced in the Governance Poll, right? The Executive is designed just to ratify what we\u2019ve already voted on in the Governance Poll.   Matthew: If there is sufficient turnout on the polling side, yes. If the voting turned out to have 1k in favor, then we needed 80K to get it through an Executive.   Rich: Obviously, there is thresholding, which makes me nervous. Perhaps a qualification, if you assume vote strength based on the number of voters or not, isn\u2019t best.   Cyrus: The GSM poll was healthy, maybe part of the process can be that the Executive is rerun to avoid the issue with just 1k MKR voting.

For individual SFs, we go by the calculated Risk Premium of the Vault type.   The Global Stability Fee is the monetary policy tool.   The DSR Spread determines the rate of the surplus we allow the system to accrue.    1352\u00d7760 140 KB  Questions and Discussion 23:57   Rich: Explain \u201cseparation of concerns?\u201d   SamM: Splitting of votes for peg stability and risk parameters. They should be separate to create clarity for voters.   Rich: I.E., the \u2018rollup\u2019 model for the executive, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s a problem.   SamM: Yes, we could have groups for peg stability or.   David: If it\u2019s trading above, you would want more demand and less supply right.   SamM: ahh, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll fix to reflect below a $1 not above.     30:16   Rich: Thanks, Sam! OK, we need to clarify a few things. What are some examples of flexibility we would lose?   Cyrus: I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s even less flexible. Maybe. Sam, your thoughts?   SamM: Technically, it\u2019s the same parameters just encoded a different way. It\u2019s more an interpretation to restrict ourselves from moving the SF for peg stability. I\u2019m asserting that we make an unambiguous and less complicated choice.     32:20   Xenofon: Looking at the cons, \u201clow volatility assets priced out\u201d is my worry. Those assets, like tokenized real estate, are much more stable and less volatile than other collateral we could use. I would like to examine why and how this would be a problem. How would these fees push out low volatility collateral from DAI?   Cyrus: I\u2019d like to take that point and clarify. I wouldn\u2019t consider this negative as part of the proposal. The proposal to think about the spread is just a different framing. If we wanted to include a lower volatility type, we could just make a vote on a negative spread if the DSR was too high. E.G., if the DSR was at 5% and we wanted to the SF to be 3%, then the poll on that vault fee would have negative ranges, and we\u2019d be, technically, fine. The point is valid but not necessarily under a spread format.   Sam: Are you saying to run the DSR spread at a negative amount or the vault fees?   Cyrus: The spread between the DSR and the total SF for that collateral type. The framing I use is: Governance polling is just a way to reflect community consensus in the system in regards to the parameters. A poll\u2019s design should allow the community to express what they want. E.G., for the DSR spread in the presentation, the community would want to vote on the base DSR and then vote on a risk premium spread for the collateral types. As long as the spread could be negative in the polls for safer collateral types, it\u2019s okay.     35:55   SamM: Also wondering why we\u2019re subsidizing collateral types if we\u2019re trying to reduce the supply of DAI? Because we raise interest rates to reduce supply.  Cyrus: Interesting question, but that\u2019s another discussion. Multiple reasons: if the launch of MCD was a metaphorical \u201copen for business\u201d sign, it\u2019s not easy to get the word out to collateral partners. Having a rate in line with traditional expectations makes more business sense and more sense from a diversification perspective. Different collateral types would improve the risk profile of the overall collateral portfolio.    37:25   Xenofon- Can you envision a situation where some collateral doesn\u2019t get the same rate of return as other collateral?   Cyrus: Yes, different collateral types should have different SFs.   Xenofon: Do we have anything written about this?   Cyrus: Yes, and we have some stuff coming in the next couple of weeks.     39:45   Matthew: Looking at the chart right now, if ETH-B is 2%, what is the total cost of capital for borrowing against that collateral type? 6?  SamM: Correct.    Matthew: Can we look one or two slides before to the equation for the DSR.   Cyrus: Shouldn\u2019t the Global SF equal the DSR?   SamM: If the spread is at 0%, it would.   Cyrus: I\u2019ll review and think back. I think the idea is on point. Just curious what the poll would be here?   SamM: We haven\u2019t reviewed the Vault Stability Fees yet, but it would be:   what\u2019s the DSR spread? and   What\u2019s the Global SF?       Risk Cyrus Migration Review 43:47  819\u00d7560 136 KB    Dai supply has been steadily increasing, up to 73 million, up about ~5 million from the last call a couple of weeks ago. The migration is slowing but is still going at a decent pace for this stage.   We just passed an Executive Vote that changed Debt Ceilings. MCD ETH Debt Ceiling up to 100 million, while the SCD ETH Debt Ceiling was lowered to 70 million.   Sai Analysis 45:35  937\u00d7610 150 KB    Sai is now below 40 million.   Collateralization Ratio has been improving slightly as well.   I think we can consider continuing to lower the Debt Ceiling on Sai. I don\u2019t think there is a need for that much of a buffer anymore.   At launch, we were anticipating a bit more market activity and the potential need for market makers to absorb some of the extra supply from the secondary lenders.   The secondary lending supply is starting to diminish for Sai. I think it\u2019s an unnecessary risk to have a 30 million additional buffer in the Sai DC right now.     DSR UR is at 41%, which is an all-time-high. This is partly because of Compound and OKex integrating DSR.   One interesting thing about Sai is that there are still about 6 million Sai in Compound. The Dai markets have full functionality now so you can borrow against deposited Dai. There really isn\u2019t much reason for the Compound Sai to be sitting there. The rate differential isn\u2019t huge, but we are reaching the point where we can consider that compound Sai to be somewhat sticky.   MKR in the burner is at around 10,000 - represents over 1% of MKR in supply that has been burned. Still, around 2.5 million in unpaid SCD fees, which is about half of where we were when the migration started/when MCD launched. Interestingly, one really large CDP accounts for about 1/3 if the unpaid fees.  There is a conversation to be had around unpaid fees - the three largest CDP\u2019s account for about 40% of the unpaid fees.    According to Santiment, about 6 million Sai hasn\u2019t moved in more than a year. Between unpaid fees and some inactive Sai and the migration showing signs of slowing down, we can start putting together estimates for our target for Sai supply for our plan for Emergency Shutdown, for our plan for fees, and so on.   Questions and Discussion 49:57   Guilherme Remor: On the Santiment measure, is it Sai in wallets or Sai that is also in contract?  Cyrus: It\u2019s for inactive wallets. Not for anything locked in SLPs.    Cyrus: There has been a considerable amount of Sai activity that has been borrowed and migrated over, potentially exploiting that ~1% arbitrage. I don\u2019t have those exact numbers, but it might be something interesting. We can look at those numbers and estimate that those market makers won\u2019t be closing their CDP\u2019s and that they are waiting for emergency shutdown.  We\u2019ll need to start tying together these different pieces of information in order to plan out what we will do over the next several months.    Cyrus: On the distribution of Sai wallets, about 100 addresses hold roughly 30 million or 2/3 of remaining Sai. Just another interesting data point when thinking about the future.  Santiment Sai network activity, check under \u201cPercentage of Active Coins\u201d    Cyrus: Does anyone have any thoughts on Emergency Shutdown or target Sai supply? (No comments)   Cyrus: Overall, migration is going well; Dai supply still growing. There is not much urgency as far as I can tell. Pegs are more or less fine, but I will let Vishesh touch upon that.   Vishesh 54:07 Relevant links Live Migration Data MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Insights  1074\u00d7599 156 KB   1079\u00d7601 170 KB   1076\u00d7609 194 KB    The total volume on Dai has been pretty light in the past 24 hours.   Over the last week, it has been relatively light as well but dipped slightly below the peg. Tiny trading volume compared to usual, things have been quiet over the holidays.   The overall price is slightly below the peg. The average has been between $0.99 and $1.00. Nothing to be severely concerned about, in my opinion.   It\u2019s been interesting to see the MCD Dai microstructures emerge at lower volumes. Everything normalizes at higher volumes. When you have really light trading days, you can see Uniswap spread over all the price ranges, centered right around the weighted average. Oasis follows a similar curve, with a little bit lower spread.   Secondary Lending Platforms   As far as what has happened to Sai on Secondary Lending Platforms, it kind of died a little bit, which is theoretically good for the migration.   Understanding what\u2019s going on in SLPs is important for when we talk about DSR spread as a major lever for governance and deciding what happens to monetary policy. It doesn\u2019t make sense to always only think of DSR vs. Stability Fee since those are just two variables. There are more to consider.    reference link1077\u00d7601 170 KB    There are at least 4 important variables, which are:   DSR   Stability fee   Average Borrow Rates   Average Supply Rates  These four variables and how they relate to each other is an important thread to follow up on.      Currently, for Sai, supply rates are falling lower while the borrow rates have come up. Volumes have cratered pretty significantly across all platforms, which is good for MCD.   For Dai, we\u2019ve seen a solid 20 million in supply and about 9 million in borrow on Compound alone.   Dai rates are kind of low compared to what we may have seen in the past for Sai. I think there are some naturally different dynamics for how secondary lending has been working for MCD vs. SCD. The major notable difference is the fact that there is a DSR now for Dai.   If we are triangulating what may be different now vs. before, that(the existence of DSR) seems to be the only major piece that actually legitimately functions differently. So this is going to be something that is interesting to monitor.   In the absence of, let\u2019s say, $30 million DAI locked UP into DSR; in the SCD universe, there would be much higher borrow rates and yields. It helps that the Stability Fee is significantly lower now, but even during the migration, we saw the supply rates jump up above the Stability Fee at certain points.        Monitoring the SLP Borrow rates versus the Stability Fees is interesting.   The Compound borrow rate is very close.   It is slightly cheaper to borrow Dai from Maker (at least for ETH collateral).   It is slightly more attractive to supply Dai to the DSR than it is to Compound.  There is a difference in risk parameters; the rates are close.       1515\u00d7651 43.6 KB    I also ran the Collateralization Ratios of Vaults in MCD. This is the visualization of the different buckets of Vaults, according to their CR level.   CR is the primary indicator of financial risk for individual Vaults, so this can be seen as the overall risk profile of the system. There is, of course, a lot more in regards to how these numbers behave and how users react to the market over time, so see this visualization with a grain of salt.      The top 12 CDPs account for half the Dai supply from ETH Vaults. Above are their Collateralization Ratios. The average CR is ~270%.   There are comparatively low CRs for a decent chunk of the Dai supply.   Everything colored below 300% collateralized is red/yellowish color. This is roughly half of the Dai Supply. The higher CRs at about 325 and higher are green.   You can see that a comparatively small chunk of the total Dai supply is more than 350% collateralized; this compares closer to what things were like during the majority of SCD\u2019s life cycle.   Note the accumulation of risk, perhaps due to higher risk tolerance with MCD. Or perhaps its an effect of the low ETH price.     Top 3 Vaults account for 23 million out of ~72 million Dai from ETH.  It\u2019s interesting to note the concentration of Dai at the top.     798\u00d7622 116 KB   The total Sai+Dai supply has leveled off slightly. When this value starts to go down, it may signify the beginning of the end of the migration. Things are quieting down now.   475\u00d7601 62.2 KB    We need to be considering and visualizing out the interplay between the deltas of different borrow and supply rates out there. For the DSR, we should be watching outside supply rates. For Stability Fees, we should be watching outside borrow rates.   For MKR governance, a big point is the spread between the DSR and Stability Fee.   I think we should visualize the rates in the greater ecosystem and how they relate to Maker\u2019s native rates.     Questions to Vishesh 1:06:58   SamM: It\u2019s my view that Maker leads these rates. Shouldn\u2019t SLP roughly follow that?   Vishesh: We\u2019ve had this discussion in the past with SLP borrow rates versus the SCD SF. The \u2018leading\u2019 versus \u2018lagging\u2019 relationship was unclear. Generally, the rule was that a SF change would have an impact on SLP rates. However, once the SF is left stable, what happens to the SLP rates? What happens to these rates becomes an indicator of the market\u2019s supply and demand levels of Dai/Sai.  We haven\u2019t created a good measure for Dai demand yet. These SLP rates are good signals to help us make informed decisions. The problem is that there are a number of confounding variables. What you do to the Stability Fee doesn\u2019t have a 1:1 impact on Dai\u2019s price stability. We haven\u2019t clearly figured that out. Though Maker is theoretically leading, you won\u2019t be able to make predictions about SLP rates on a time scale.    SamM: Eventually, as we continue to move our rates in one direction or the other,  we hit an equilibrium point, right? Isn\u2019t that enough to make some inference about the relationship between the rates?   Vishesh: This is all about managing that equilibrium point. How to manage a sudden change in ETH price impacting the DAI price. So managing short-term and medium-term stability. We\u2019ve seen a low SF in the past work, and likewise, a high SF work. When ETH price swings, that becomes a problem, and you need to offset the impact. Given the current ETH price, it\u2019s hard to pick a SF or DSR to match the appropriate equilibrium.   SamM: Right, but theoretically, there should be able an ideal number. If we keep moving around, we should hit it at some point.   Vishesh: In terms of moving around the spread or the SF?   SamM: SF   Vishesh: It\u2019s helpful to talk about the impact of each parameter here. The SF primarily serves to impact the overall supply, and the DSR serves to impact the absorption of the oversupply or provide a small amount of additional low-risk yield for people who want to lock up some capital and collect a small, stable 4%(DSR) over time.   Vishesh: Visualizing out a combination of those two parameters, theoretically, what you are managing is supply and demand. The usage of that DSR should increase when demand decreases due to supply increase. If, for example, you see a cratering in the ETH price and leverage becomes increasingly more attractive, DSR is not gonna make much of a difference. What is going to have an impact is the Stability Fee.   Vishesh: Hence, the Stability Fee is a significantly more important parameter for the peg, while DSR is significantly more impactful on SLP rates.       1:13:39   Guilherme: I\u2019m interested in the graph you presented about the Collateralization Ratios for MCD Vaults. Have you noticed a recent impact of risk on low volatility? Or is that something that has been observed for a while.   Vishesh: That graph is not a time series but represents a current state. From my observation, that has not changed significantly since the launch of MCD. What I have noticed is that it appears to be a bit different from what I observed in the past with SCD.   In terms of whether it is responsive to market volatility or not, I think that those CRs are a more long-term representation of user behavior and risk tolerance vs. yields. It may be more of a function of yields and stability fees rather than being primarily influenced by market volatility.   Given these lower rates, it may be that that\u2019s a reason for the higher risk. Something to consider is what are the variables that drive risk. There is more to consider than just market volatility. For example, as ETH drops in price, there is an influx of collateral that enters the system as a whole.       1:16:48   Guilherme: How should we handle the variability in risk profiles among Vault owners? The assumption here is that we are considering risk appetites among Vault owners, but in reality, people have different appetites, and we should keep that in mind when assuming behaviors.  Vishesh: In theory, this is a dynamic Dai supply with multiple different risk profiles already baked into it. At the moment, there is one rate for all of it. But as you segment it out, and as you dynamically adjust different risk profiles to have different rates(through different Vault types ETH-A ETH-B ETH-C), you are theoretically reducing economic waste in the system. That\u2019s a better way of thinking about it.    Rich: Wrapping it up, that\u2019s the end of the 1st G&R for 2020 thanks to all for presenting and see you in the forums and next week.

Specifically, we saw money Legos can become money Jenga(s), depending on your perspective. Even chess is an apt metaphor, a finely crafted maneuver(talking about the Flash Loan attack on Bzx/Fulcrum.) To establish some further context, I\u2019m going to chat about the Governance Security Module(GSM) for the uninitiated.   The GSM is a safeguard that enables a time delay after an Executive Vote is passed. Everyone has opinions, and that\u2019s important. It\u2019s been on the MCD road map for quite some time. It\u2019s critical for the health of the system, and there are nuances to understand why the delay was initially turned off(set to 0). A 0 delay gave a brand new protocol time to settle, maintaining agility for technical issues if they were to immediately arise. A 0 delay cuts exploit surfaces. Post-launch, we didn\u2019t encounter any issues, and the discussion began for the GSM vote, which we posted in December.   As an ecosystem, we found that there are trade-offs to setting a delay: agility to patch bugs or safeguards from governance capture? Which risk is more significant? The community debated this, and the current sentiment is that in the absence of any bugs and with the existence of flash loans, the possibility for Governance attacks has become a larger risk that needs to be mitigated.   We still aren\u2019t sure exactly why the initial GSM vote didn\u2019t pass. It might have been that the tradeoff became understood, or perhaps it was just the holidays. Thanks to the beauty of the blockchain, we can see what people do with their MKR but, unfortunately, no knowledge as to why they do it.   Resurfacing a vote is a difficult problem, too, because we have to make a judgment call about why a vote didn\u2019t pass. Then to decide whether and when to vote on the issue again. Do we assume that circumstance guided the vote, and we bring it up again, or do we let is just sit as \u201cthe will of the community.\u201d Serendipitously, a thread in the forums popped up asking about GSM again, thanks LongForWisdom, and it got traction.   The thread also aligned with the recent debacle around exploiting flash loans. With flash loans, people can take high-risk uncollateralized trading positions and perform complex actions in a single block. This increases the risk of a Governance attack on MakerDao.     There are significant complexities we need to understand, and we need to set the stage before we talk about GSM. The ecosystem evolved a new attack vector, and one antibody is the GSM. The other is the dark fix. We need to understand the nature of decentralization in our protocol. Humans, algorithms, or a combination of both?   Do we accept that the ecosystem is adversarial, or do we want to collaborate to set up guardrails? How do we handle strong or weak Executive Votes? We should speak about continuous approval voting, specifically if it\u2019s robust enough?   Especially this week, for example, what do we do if we roll up several polls into Friday vote where one or more may be contentious? Tomorrow we raise the DC in the Dai ecosystem, and we have the vote for the GSM. What happens if the vote doesn\u2019t pass? It ties into another thread we\u2019ve been discussing in regards to bundling changes. That\u2019s the context, topics, and history. Let\u2019s proceed!   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Risk Vishesh Relevant links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs State of the pegs 13:46  1061\u00d7685 215 KB   Overall, total Dai is at $120 million, with Dai from ETH at $115 million, Dai from BAT at $1.6 million, and Dai from Sai at $2.8 million. This is a slight dip in the overall supply and will be discussed with regard to ETH. Overall, the collateralization ratio went up and then back down.   1077\u00d7675 220 KB   Currently, Dai is trading slightly below the peg with larger than normal trading volumes. A huge chunk of this is from dYdX. Over this last week, we\u2019ve seen some large DAI/ETH trades on dYdX due to vast fluctuations in ETH price recently.   1073\u00d7680 230 KB   Despite large volumes of trades, Dai has remained very close to the $1 peg. This is an indicator that the system is working more efficiently than in the SCD days, despite large changes in ETH price.   914\u00d7462 32.8 KB    About $65 million of the total DAI(from ETH) supply is 300% collateralized or less. About $57 million is 275% collateralized or less. This means that about half of the supply is at a slight risk, and half the supply is in mid-to-high risk. The portion at significant risk (225% Collaterilization or lower) is about $27 million, not an insignificant amount.   These CR\u2019s are partly due to rebalancing in the collateral amounts that occurred as a result of ETH price movement over the last week or two. There is not much in liquidations during that time-frame.   Additionally, some speculation regarding the reasoning for removal of ETH collateral (as well as removal of a large amount of MKR from Uniswap) is the recent flash loan exploit and fears about protocol security. Though, of course, it is very hard to guess why people might be moving their collateral.    1009\u00d7262 78.1 KB   Over time, we\u2019ve seen a nominal rise in collateral, and then in one fell swoop, the collateral amount dropped down.   811\u00d7230 69.8 KB   Similarly, that debt was growing and dipped in the last 48 hours or so.  Questions and Discussion 19:20   Rich: Do we know what the drop in collateral was about? Was it a response to flash loans, or is it restoring a position or paying down debt?   V: There was some refinancing to Compound for sure. The reasoning is difficult to pinpoint. MKR governance attack risks may have affected this behavior.   R: How much MKR available on secondary markets?   Andy: I\u2019ve worked on a script to see the liquidity of MKR on different platforms. Right now, it is around 13,000.   Rich: Fantastic. There\u2019s a really interesting point that we could talk about in the call regarding people pulling MKR out of secondary lending platforms. I\u2019m choosing to see that as an attempt to secure the system.   V: A few individuals provided MKR to Uniswap in the last month or so. Essentially, in the last 48 hours, two large whales, one of which purchased about 1,000 MKR in Uniswap, effectively drained the liquidity, thereby pulling out their liquidity. One took out 11.2 thousand MKR that he was supplying to the Uniswap pool. Net, it fell to about 4,300 MKR, which has dipped another 0.1 or 0.2 thousand MKR in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, it went from about 16,000 to about 4,000 MKR. This coincides with the 11% price pump, the day of, which has since come down to about 9%.     Tech Mariano Conti Dark Fix Overview 22:55   Mariano: Currently, 150,000 MKR is protecting the top spell. Even the MKR foundation\u2019s non-voting shares, the Dev fund, cannot surpass this.   That said, everything that is about to happen is part of the road map. The delay exists, and it currently exists at 0. We discussed numerous times why a 0 delay was a good idea for the first few months of MCD. A vote was held in December 2019 to change this, but it did not pass.   In the BzX Flack Loan exploit, they had a delay but removed it for bug fixes. We thought about this, and we believe the dark fix is an elegant solution, a compromise between agility and security. This is part of our goal for progressive decentralization. It is not the ultimate solution. There are still a few whales who can get together and affect outcomes. MKR is not as distributed as it could be.   In the future, we can shut down and deploy a new system using the ESM. Right now, the system is so new that it is not feasible to do this. In the future, it will be possible for one transaction to shut it down and a few more to set up a new system, or perhaps even have a backup system to migrate to if necessary.   Now that the GSM question has resurfaced, we will set up a new vote tomorrow to increase the GSM delay to 24 hours, which has been on the road map all along. My question to the community is thus: does this qualify as an emergency vote? Do we bundle this with what came out of this weekly poll?   Questions and Discussion 27:42   Rich: I\u2019m going to volunteer LongForWisdom for the topic of bundling and GSM delay.   LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll start with what we voted in. Emergency technical changes should replace non-emergency monetary ones. The important phrasing is that someone needs to define an emergency. According to the wording of that poll, we said that the foundation dev team would be the judge of what is an emergency for technical changes until voted otherwise. Monetary changes will be in the interest of Cyrus. What this means is that the technical team can say that it is an emergency and could then boot the other stuff out of the executive vote and not bundle it. If we wanted not to bundle, we would have to decide as a community to make that decision. So far, there hasn\u2019t been a precedent in this definition as the technical team has not announced an emergency.   R: This is the difficulty. As soon as the community develops a set of rules and protocols, there\u2019s immediately an edge case. Is there a decision tree that we should put into place? Perhaps a public debate? Who has the more significant emergency? Is there a third option? Is it mandatory that we split off technical and monetary?   L: I think in the case that the technical team marks something as an emergency, then yes. That\u2019s how we voted. Unless we decide otherwise, or the technical team announces an emergency, the vote should be bundled.   Mariano: I do not think this is an emergency. It requires liquidity, which isn\u2019t there. I wouldn\u2019t qualify this as an emergency.   R: Well, the liquidity isn\u2019t here today, but it may be there tomorrow.   M: I believe we can wait one day and put everything together tomorrow.     31:53   R: I would like to explore the idea of weak vs. strong executives. It comes down to a go/no-go on the emergency decision. Does the engineering team think that this is considered an emergency?   Wouter: It is not an emergency, but to avoid devolving into one, then we should vote for the delay this week. That may sound facetious, but it is a significant difference. An emergency would be if the liquidity were available, or close to being available. We have to operate under the assumption that whatever MKR is available is already tied up in a script that is waiting to attack the system. Waiting another week could bring about an emergency.   R: That\u2019s a useful distinction. An emergency could represent an existential threat to the system. Or it could be an attack vector on the system. A declaration of emergency could be seen as a lack of faith in the ecosystem\u2019s capability to deal with confusion. Some may view 5 or 6 items on an EV and deem it too confusing or risky. A judicial sort of thinking that removes options from the table - that\u2019s something I\u2019m concerned about.  So tomorrow\u2019s poll will have six items - 5 polls and the GSM delay.    M: This is good, at least we\u2019ll have precedent for next time. Don\u2019t take my relaxed demeanor as a lack of importance. We are prepared for this contingency, but we need to take action soon. The script is ready and tested.   Rich: As always, it is crucial to balance apathy and urgency. If this is important, it will require active participation, communication, and campaigning, not just MKR.     36:57   Cmooney: I know we passed the poll that talked about emergency technical changes having precedence over monetary changes, and this was put into the Executive Vote, but the EV did not pass because everyone piled on to the current hat to guard it. We should probably decide if the poll is enough or whether we need the executive to pass for that to be policy.   R: This may have been a mistake on my part. To ratify decisions, we have our signaling policy and the executive. As a system, polls were used as a measure of sentiment, and changing the system is done on the executive. It\u2019s evolved to polls for decisions on intent, policy, process, or mandates on specific actors. Maybe we can claim ambiguity and not a mistake on my part, but the bundling of monetary and technical fixes probably should have stayed as a poll. However, it was bundled up as an executive, and the executive failed.   C: I\u2019m happy with that answer.   R: Does that mean we need to do the poll again?   L: I think it\u2019s okay, the executive was always for fundamental changes to the protocol, right?   R: Not always   L: Generally, then.   R: There is also another experiment, where we just find out how many people disagree with a decision. If there is an ambiguity that the system can\u2019t support, then we could discuss, but so far, there is evidence of passing available on-chain.     41:45   Cmooney: My second point was about the spell in the SCD debt ceiling; I wanted to stress that when we discuss the GSM delay, it\u2019s for the MCD system. There is no pause or delay mechanism for SCD. Everyone should be more diligent about setting DC parameters in SCD and setting them for different ilk types(collateral types) in MCD. If we tighten those DC\u2019s up, we achieve one monetary goal of deprecating SCD and guarding against a flash loan style attack on SCD filtering into MCD.   Mariano: To recap, we will be implementing the GSM with a 24-hour delay. These parameters were discussed before the MCD launch and follow the road map; they exist to protect MCD. We\u2019ll propose the vote Monday. As Chris said, we should be protecting SCD as well, even if it is a much tinier system. We will post, too, leaving it to the community to decide whether the GSM should also protect SCD.   We will also be monitoring tomorrow: the hats, the amount of MKR, and discussing with relevant stakeholders when they want to move MKR to make sure the hat is always at or above the highest amount of MKR liquidity available on the market. Tomorrow is going to be very interesting, and I\u2019m looking forward to it.   Rich: Is there an order of operations for this? GSM delay, dark fix, SCD fix - how are we voting for this?   M: The dark fix is a method for fixing bugs without outright telling someone what it is. It isn\u2019t a traditional vote.   Wouter: We don\u2019t technically need a vote for the dark fix right now. The system already supports this. You put up a proposal, and if it passes, it triggers a spell. That spell has the authority to affect the system. The reason why the dark fix is supported already: a spell can be anything.   W: A spell can allow for a change given a certain fingerprint or hash group. We wanted to clarify this before the GSM vote. To double-check that the method functions, and because it\u2019s important to discuss with the community. Balancing the need to trigger ES and the trade-offs of trust and attestations for implementing a dark fix.   Rich: I disagree. We\u2019ve talked about these buckets for decision-making processes (policy, mandates, process, levers). The dark fix in itself can be considered a technical deploy, but it has implications and impact on the social and governance layer. Especially for that trust layer deployment.   W: Clarifying from a technical point of view, deploying a dark fix is the same as any other change in the system. It just doesn\u2019t reveal the executable bytecode. For a critical change, like the kind necessary to implement a bug fix using the dark fix system, you would need a vote. And it is important that we have this discussion before this issue comes up: do we require a governance poll to make changes, etc. But strictly from a technical point of view, it does not require voting.   Rich: There\u2019s a distinction worth exploring. The technical fix is clear, but the implications of this fix are fairly weighty. Security, complexity, disclosure, trust, choosing which actors in the system get that trust, we should leave it up to the ecosystem to debate and vote.   LFW: The reason we shouldn\u2019t vote on the dark fix as a vehicle for bug fixes: there are three options in the face of critical exploits:    Emergency shutdown     Use the dark fix     Deploy the fix with visible byte code.      Given those options, this is why we shouldn\u2019t vote on the dark fix: the dev team has made it clear that we shouldn\u2019t use the visible byte code fix(3). This cuts off one option of the three. ESM is always available, so that takes the other option(1). We shouldn\u2019t vote on it because there are no options to vote on since it\u2019s essentially a requirement.   R: We\u2019ll still have to talk about the implications on the social layer.   L: Agreed     53:52   LongForWisdom: Let\u2019s discuss the polls that passed this week. The poll results that would be bundled with this weeks coming executive:   DC increasing $125-150 million   DSR spread .5 -> 0%   MCD SF adjustment to 8% which is the same   Sai SF 9.5%   Minimum bid reduction to 2% from 3%, which passed.   M: Just need to monitor surplus auctions for keeper activity, make sure they\u2019re still incentivized to bid.   Joe: There\u2019s been about 3-4 bidders and some people still bidding above market.     56:50   Chat Snaketh$xor: \u201chow are audits for GSM module coming?\u201d   L: I believe GSM deployed, it\u2019s just not active   M: Correct. It deployed three months ago with MCD; we wish to change it from \u20180\u2019 to the number of seconds in 24 hours.     Governance Debate 58:51   R: Let\u2019s encourage some debate. We have quite a few people here, and there are weighty issues to discuss.   Dawson: With the Dark fix, how do you reduce the scope of its impact?   W: The current proposal limits the dark fix so that the exact change that will execute isn\u2019t visible on-chain. The fingerprint of that change is hard-coded in the fix. Trusted parties vouching for the dark fix would sign a transaction on-chain agreeing with that exact fingerprint. It\u2019s limited by what the auditors agree too.   W: however, it\u2019s permissions aren\u2019t limited like any other spell. It has similar access. Soon the system will work like regions with module authorizations; in that framing, then you can restrict the dark fix to a particular module or action. You don\u2019t want permissions to be too specific since that would be the same effect as publishing the code, pointing malicious actors to issues in the protocol. For example, \u201cremove collateral type X\u201d in any of the documentation points people towards problems with that collateral type.     1:02:01   Andy(cryptowanderer): One comment first: I like to look back at the history of the internet, and even IRC chats about decision making. At LiGo, they ran into issues with data. You\u2019ll always have issues with authorizations of public auditors and dev communication. At LiGo, since it\u2019s already difficult to determine gravity waves, they increase the amount of fake data to analyze. It might be a consideration to add empty dark fixes, which gives more weight to the technical teams\u2019 \u201cemergencies\u201d label.   Now my question: I was leaning towards just the GSM vote tomorrow, but I\u2019d love to understand the Sai attack vector and how that would affect Dai. Where the two overlap.   R: Something akin to fire drills? That\u2019s a great idea; I\u2019d also like an elaboration on the exploit.   Mariano: We have that adapter for migrating Sai to Dai. That adapter makes Sai privileged collateral on MCD. We have a Debt Ceiling for how much Dai mints using Sai. If there was an exploit on the single collateral side, Sai could be arbitrarily minted and converted into Dai, affecting MCD.   Cyrus: Then, by migrating to MCD, you can continue until you hit the DC of the adapter. Is that why we suggested lowering the DC for the particular adapter?   M: Correct.   C: Can we clarify how that relates to governance attacks. If there is no GSM for SCD, then the attack is about minting more Sai and then migrating it.   M: Correct, right up until they hit the DC. Ideally, the DC should be synchronous, and I think the executive from last week doesn\u2019t include synchronicity. It was supposed to lower the Sai DC to $20 Million. There wasn\u2019t the inclusion of MCD\u2019s DC too. It looks like that particular vote isn\u2019t happening, everyone is protecting the hat, and the new vote is taking precedence. We should consider another vote to adjust the DC again.   L: An MCD DC vote next week sounds good.   C: We\u2019ll put up a governance poll Monday and leave it open for discussion in RocketChat.     1:09:54   R: The primary complexity with the dark fix is who do we trust and how to avoid cognitive/rhetorical fallacies? Is it better to have a wide group for validation? Is it better to hope that the biggest holders will defend the system? Or is it because they only care about profits? Or do we want to trust the old world? E.G., The legacy financial system with a mega-corporation to sign agreements and not leak information. Or would we empower trusted actors from our own ecosystem?   The first camp trades on profits to ensure MKR security; the second group is bonded and insured; the third is crypto natives, where reputation is slightly more important. Perhaps combinations of those three camps are best, but an ongoing conversation and evaluation of the group are important.   Mitote: Wondering about how communication happens between devs and signatories? What\u2019s the most secure way?   R: Agreed and the turnaround time for some large corporations. Another question: is 24 hours enough time?   W: To clarify, 24 hours isn\u2019t for attestations. The 24-hour delay kicks in after the signing. Giving the community time to pass dark fix, trigger ES, or allow it to pass.     1:13:59   Cyrus: After GSM passes, the proposal comes through, and is flagged. What\u2019s next?   CMooney: We wrote up a quick spell that we could use to drop a spell when the delay is in place. You could think of it like get out the vote. This extra spell goes in. We make it clear, across social media, that voting for this spell allows us to remove a malicious spell from the GSM queue instantly.   Cyrus: Could you just add more MKR to the current hat? Say current is 50k and malicious is 60k?   Cmooney: That\u2019s the step before we fail to prevent a malicious proposal. We should flag it and be aware. We can guard against it with the hat. The situation we\u2019re evaluating is: if someone uses deep liquidity, a flash loan to lift the hat, and then schedules a malicious proposal; We\u2019d have twenty-four hours to mobilize the spell that drops the malicious actions. Much like the campaign that we saw yesterday.   C: Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to campaign to secure the hat?   Cmooney: Correct. The first line of defense. But if it\u2019s instantaneous, like a flash loan lifting the hat manages to get it into the GSM queue, our next defense is to try and stop it. We\u2019ll need 50K MKR to shutdown.   Cyrus: I\u2019m lost on how we would use the cancel spell if we can\u2019t secure the current hat.   Cmooney: Assuming it\u2019s a flash loan getting the proposal in quickly, the current hat has 150K MKR on it. Attackers would only have so much time, and MKR liquidity, to execute a malicious Governance action that goes past the hat into the GSM queue.   W: There are large MKR holders who don\u2019t feel comfortable keeping MKR in the system. They might move it to cold storage. When an emergency pops up, it\u2019s a matter of persuading them to add their MKR back, canceling the unexpected proposal.     1:18:38   Cyrus: Follow up question, if we\u2019re just canceling, and the large holders won\u2019t secure the current hat, what\u2019s to stop the attackers from returning 24 hours later?   W: You would have to make sure after the cancellation that the situation isn\u2019t the same. Otherwise, there is space for another attack.   C: Does voting for cancellation spell remove your MKR from the current hat? If you wanted to vote for the cancellation   Cmooney: Not if you use more advanced voting API, Nik introduced that.   W: Cancellation, in that respect, isn\u2019t different from other spells. In our current voting UI, you would be moving it to that cancellation spell and removing it from the current hat. If we\u2019re using the more advanced voting mechanism in the UI, you can vote for the old hat and cancellation spell at the same time.   C: If the cancellation spell goes through, the current hat just stays?   W: It is a new state; every action which executes is a new hat.   M: The spell removing the previous spell would be the hat. You would be voting for that.   Kurt: Assuming a potentially malicious spell is plotted, that would mean that you have a malicious hat, you would want off that hat anyway.   Cmooney: Caveat here is while malicious spell has hat they can plot additional attacks. You want to remove it from being the hat quickly.     1:21:50   Wouter: Happy that we mentioned fire drills. I agree with the concerns for using that with Dark fixes; I think it might fit better on other mechanisms that only apply in emergencies like ES. We need to do drills with integration partners to prepare for ES. Same thing for the cancellation process. Rare events should be practiced in advance due to their rarity. Looking forward to exploring the extreme states of the system to understand the mechanisms and the underlying systems better.   C: Can we talk about expectations: who is monitoring for malicious proposals?   M: That falls under the gradual decentralization road map. Today, we have the Foundation to alert people when to worry. The path forward is building readily available and robust monitoring and alerting infrastructure. With a low barrier to entry, anyone can spin up a monitoring instance.   R: There are mechanisms in the ecosystem, encouraging this tooling. There is a grants program, for example. We\u2019re interested in funding any governance tooling.     1:25:39   R: Cryptowanderer mentions concerns around triggering ES when doing a fire drill. We don\u2019t use the Foundation MKR for voting.   R: Richard Lopez mentioned a Dark fix monitoring tool. This would be great.   Richard Lopez: Just like we have governance monitoring, having diagnostics at the end of fixes would be helpful. It would need a lag, and I\u2019m not sure if weighting by the severity of each bug would be best. Open diagnostics allows devs to continue and keep the community in the loop about ongoing work, so nothing feels \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d   R: There is value in maintaining a historical record. We also have mkrgov.science, which potentially could include some of those features. It\u2019s a community-led effort, again, any improvements let us know if you\u2019re interested in building with us.     Credits   Tim Black produced this summary.

My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of Community Development at MakerDAO and not for much longer the Interim Governance Facilitator. We have some exciting developments in that camp. I encourage everyone to head up to the forums and take a look at LongForWisdom post. I proposed the addition of a new Governance Facilitator last week, maybe the week before. Very exciting things happening, so there are going to be new additions, and it also ties into another theme that we\u2019re going to be discussing today, empowered actors in the ecosystem.   We have two new empowered actors that Charles is going to be introducing to us later on in the schedule. He will also be walking us through MIPs again because they are very very important and it\u2019s critical that this group and our protocol, in general, begins to internalize the implications of it, what it\u2019s going to look like, how it\u2019s going to be implemented, what it takes, what requires to get involved with that process and when. Calendaring is always a huge thing, as well. Not the sexiest thing in the world but critically important, and he\u2019ll talk about that for a bit.   LongForWisdom will give us Governance at a Glance. How hard could that be? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much governance happening this week, so it should be super fast to crank through that one, and, oh, this is very exciting: Lev is here! Lev is going to talk about wBTC and his post from the forum. It\u2019s a fascinating project, and obviously, Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain will change everything, so this is a really interesting development. Cyrus is going to be talking about risk and collateral, and then Vishesh will be here to give us the State of the Pegs.   I want to hit a beat that I\u2019ve been hitting every call for the last month. I\u2019ve been refining my memes as the call progresses. The new meme is \u201cThe path from intention to implementation.\u201d And that\u2019s what we need to think about. MakerDAO, Maker Foundation, community, and ecosystem have aligned over the last couple of years to build a very sophisticated protocol that supports the DeFi space. To do so requires a great deal of work, time, energy, and money. As we become more successful and sophisticated, the amount of work and coordination that takes increases, and let\u2019s add some more complexity to that picture, why not. We\u2019re also externally driven, which means that we\u2019re designed to be decentralized. It\u2019s not branding, that\u2019s the core mission. We need to rapidly expand our operations outside of the walls of the Foundation, that means we need to identify empowered actors and groups of stakeholders, and give them what they need to begin to drive the bus for us and control their own levers and ultimately take control of the protocol and their own destiny (let\u2019s get dramatic). In order to do that, it requires operational overhead. It requires coordination; it requires communication; it requires Governance, humans interacting with other humans. This is a learning process for all of us as we begin to expose more hooks into the protocol and hand-off the decision-making process.   The community and the ecosystem, the governance community as well, signals its intention. We have tools to capture this, in the forum, the portal, with votes and polls. That guides the direction of everybody else involved in this process. What we need to do very soon is to begin differentiating between intention and implementation. I\u2019m preaching to the converted here since this is a sophisticated group of individuals, and presumably, we all have very complicated jobs. And in those jobs, when something needs to be done, stakeholders need to be identified, plans need to be made, people need to sign off, developers, PR, content writers, smart contracts need to be developed, auditors need to be brought to the table. Nothing is simple in this world. The path from intending to do something to actually doing that thing can be complicated.   Right now, we have a system where we signal intentions, and recently we were seeing some examples of intentions that had dates associated with them, and those dates went into the system before any feasibility plan was associated with them. We\u2019re running into situations where the community wants something to happen, picks a date for that thing to happen, and then we have to go back try to figure out whether it\u2019s possible for that to happen, and that\u2019s backward.   In the absence of prior planning, it\u2019s impossible to judge bandwidth appropriately and determine scope. When you don\u2019t have those two things, it\u2019s very easy to begin a flywheel process where intention comes into the system, but implementation cannot come out of the system. Figuring out that you\u2019ve hit that point frequently occurs after it\u2019s too late. We\u2019re on a situation right now. Let me see if I can list them all. Right now we have a few things on the go:   SCD Shutdown   Collateral Compensation Group   Dark fix   GSM   Collateral Onboarding   Introduction of the MIPs process.       As of 11 minutes ago, we had ten separate polls in the polling system from just one week, and we\u2019re looking at more next week.  It\u2019s my contention that we are already stressed, as far as our cognitive load goes. Our ability to process new ideas and identify all the threads and all the projects in motion had problems weeks ago, and now things are busier. That puts us in a situation where we need to optimize process and understand how we can start attacking these problems that we have in the ecosystem, or these challenges or new issues that we want to address in a more considered and deliberate manner. That is my segue because we have a solution to this problem! And that solution is a framework called the MIPs process.    I\u2019d like to encourage everyone to internalize the fact that MIPs are a thing and are going to be implemented soon. I\u2019d love for people to take some of their copious free time and head into the forums and start reviewing some of these things. If you\u2019re interested in moving the protocol if you\u2019re interested in becoming more engaged, if you have skin in this game, if you have collateral types that you want to see introduced, this is the path to do that. I\u2019m not going to get too deep into it because that\u2019s Charles\u2019s jam. But here\u2019s my caution: everybody internalize that and know that it\u2019s coming. In early May, the format of these calls is going to change radically. We\u2019ll have new people assuming new responsibilities, we\u2019ll have a more formalized process, so if you want to be prepared for that you\u2019re going to need to do some research, I think. As usual, some generalized caution.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance at a glance LongForWisdom 9:52   Action Required: State of the Peg  Parafi\u2019s post about the state of the peg, where they posted a fairly robust argument in support of taking action to address the Dai price disparity from the peg. I see that prompted a lot of activity, and there\u2019s a lot of discussion going on that thread. If you want to know what\u2019s going on, I suggest reading that thread and getting involved.    It\u2019s time for a second Governance Facilitator   This was the second one, and I have now responded to the thread. Read it.   Cyrus Younessi: Sorry to interrupt. Did you accept the position?   LongForWisdom: I said I would be willing to do it if ratified, yes.       The Release of the 13 Initial Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)   MIPs are still a thing. There\u2019s a thread for each MIP. The discussion continues in many of them. We had a meeting run by Lucas from Centrifuge, where we discussed some of the MIPs. There is a link to the recording of that discussion.    Seeking Consensus   Signal Request: Calibrating GSM delay in light of recent market events  The calibration of the GSM delay is currently on-chain, on voting whether to change the GSM delay to 12 hours or 24 hours and whether to include a change in the next executive vote.    Signal Request: Grace period between when SCD shutdown spell is scheduled and actual shutdown  The problem is now finished on the Grace Period between the SCD shutdown spell and the actual emergency shutdown of SCD or global settlement of SCD. I believe that will not go on-chain separately, will just be included in the executive when we come to shut down. General reminder, as Rich said, there are like ten on-chain polls, which I think they\u2019re finished now, so I guess you should have voted. Timing-wise it\u2019s a little bit awkward. There are probably going to be more next week.    Maker Improvement Proposals Charles St. Louis Ratification of Domain Team Roles 13:34  Charles St.Louis: I\u2019ve been putting together a calendar diagram that I will share in the forums. I\u2019m not quite done yet, but I will verbally communicate it here. The current request for the comments stage is still ongoing until the timing poll occurs on the 27th. What that means is that people can go and make suggestions for the MIP authors to take into account. This includes the 13 initial MIPs, as well as the two new sub-proposals that were proposed yesterday: the first one is my proposal to get myself ratified as the MIP editor, and the second one is the smart contract domain team\u2019s sub-proposal to get them onboarded and ratified as well. I\u2019m going to share those here, and I will briefly go over them after I walk through the timeline, but just in case you want to look at it before, they are in the chat.  14:45   Rich Brown: Can you give a brief description about what each role is all about, what their responsibilities will be?   Charles St.Louis: As a MIP editor, there will be more in the future, but as the first one, I will support and enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process. Getting them onboarded to the governance cycle, making sure that proposals are formatted correctly, and there is no missing information, and that the full list is actually discussed in MIP 0, under component 10, which basically describes that the MIP editors are responsible for maintaining and managing the future MIPs at MakerDAO site that mirrors the GitHub, which has not yet formally been created: provide feedback and have discussions with MIPs sections on the forums; so that\u2019s kind of shepherding the process for MIP 6 proposals, making sure that people know where to go and how to get the ideas out there, processing those MIPs; the management organization of the MIP and sub-proposal preambles, changing the statuses throughout their life cycles, making sure the authors and contributors are listed and updating the dates on the ratification of proposals. The MIP editors will also be charged with onboarding the next MIP editors or replacing them.   Charles: In terms of what some of the tasks are, as a MIP editor, for enforcing the MIPs framework, you basically would be:   Working to confirm the title accurately describes a proposal.   Making sure it has the correct labels and tags.   Assigning the formal MIP number as it goes through the MIP cycle.   Changing the statuses of each MIP.   Making sure MIPs are in the right category.   Working with the governance facilitators on coordinating governance and executive votes in relation to MIPs and getting them into the governance cycle.     Charles: As for the smart contract domain team, maybe Mariano wants to speak more to that. His proposal highlights what they\u2019ve done in the past. The foundation smart contracts team, everyone knows them on this call, will be working particularly on collateral onboarding as we kick that off with building the collateral adapters and deploying the other necessary smart contracts, like the ionizer and oracle security module.  Smart contracts Domain team    Mariano Conti: I\u2019ll just give a quick overview, as mostly everything is on the actual document. This is pretty much a formal step to take because of the MIP process. We will continue doing what we\u2019ve been doing all along and into the near future, not just collateral onboarding, but when things need to be done, executive spells, the thing we had with the debt options that needed to be fixed, etc. I\u2019d like to say that we\u2019re building on a very immutable blockchain that changes every 3 to 6 months via hard forks. That needs to be taken into account as well so that we can make sure that the protocol continues to run correctly as Ethereum grows. That\u2019s all I\u2019d say. You can find the rest on the forums unless anybody has any questions.     Charles: As I mentioned before, the Request for Comments stage, where people from the community can make comments or suggest any changes, ends the day before the timing vote, so on the 26th. Then, the 27th is when the community makes the decision on whether to proceed with the ratification vote of the initial 13 MIPs and those two sub-proposals, or delay ratification for one month.   If they do decide to change or delay the ratification for one month, this allows for competing proposals to be submitted by the community, and this would change the timeline for the actual ratification of the MIPs. In that case, the deadline for submitting the competing proposals would be on May 20th, and then there would be another vote where the community would come in and select the final individual MIPs to create the MIP sets. That would occur from May 23rd to May 26th. In this case, the governance ratification vote would occur on May 27th to May 30th, effectively resulting in the governance cycle beginning on June 1st.   If we do decide to proceed with the ratification vote of the 13 initial MIPs and the two sub-proposals, the governance ratification vote will occur on May 1st, and May 4th and the governance cycle will then begin on May 4th itself.     In terms of what can happen now until the governance cycle begins: as you\u2019ve seen,   MIP 6 forms can start to be proposed and reviewed in the forums for collateral types to be added in the future, but note that they won\u2019t be officially valid until the ratification vote passes. But that shouldn\u2019t stop any feedback in the processing period from happening, that can go on throughout the process.   In terms of actually getting the collateral onboarding process kick-started, once the governance cycle is in place on May 4th, the collateral types can be formally submitted to the governance cycle on May 4th itself to the 6th. Meaning that MIP 12 submissions that follow the MIP 6 collateral type applications can occur during this period of time. MIP 12 contains the requirements from the risk team, the oracle team, and the smart contracts team. In this case, the smart contracts team and the oracle\u2019s team will lay out exactly what they need to do in terms of requirements for getting that collateral type added and it will be submitted as a MIP 12 subproposal by either the person who has submitted the original collateral application, by communicating with the domain teams directly, or by one of the domain teams submitting it themselves. As I mentioned, I will finish up this diagram highlighting everything I\u2019ve just described, but that\u2019s pretty much the updated timeline on everything on MIPs that\u2019s going to be happening over the next couple of weeks. If there are any questions, I can answer them now.     Rich Brown: It doesn\u2019t sound like any questions are coming. If people have questions, though, they can course them later on or type them in the sidebar or join the forum posts, so they are recorded for all time. Lev, I think you\u2019re up - do you want to walk us through the WBTC RFC?   Lev Livnev wBTC As Collateral - Request For Comments 22:33   I\u2019m going to start by posting this wBTC Request for Comments thread here in the chat. I\u2019ll be brief and then allow people to ask questions.   The context of this is the discussion that\u2019s been going on already for a couple of days and started with the forum post called \u201cAction Required - State of the peg\u201d, which is discussing the sustained premium that Dai has had on the marketplace for basically ever since the 12th of March. I\u2019m not going to address the context that makes this necessary, but one of the main strategies that are under discussion there are about adding collateral types that are likely to result in Dai issuance and create supply to put down the pressure on the price and normalize and demonstrate that governance has had it under control.   For this, I would like to propose wBTC as such a collateral type to be considered in this emergency context, which implicitly means skipping through some of the process that\u2019s currently being created for proper collateral onboarding, similarly to the other collateral types that are being discussed in this emergency context. However, to be able to propose anything I felt the need to quickly throw together some kind of framework, and I\u2019m willing to take suggestions on what this framework should look like, but basically, it consists of these three questions:   Is the collateral considered, in principle, an asset that one day should be added to MCD with some choice of risk parameters? I think we all agree that even as an emergency measure, we wouldn\u2019t be fast-tracking some collateral that we in good faith don\u2019t expect would ever have been collateralized under normal circumstances.   Do we think that adding this collateral in the very near future (with some reasonable risk parameters) actually leads the Dai issuance in material quantities would affect the price of Dai in the market?   If the answer to the above questions is yes: what are the risk parameters that we should use while making sure that we\u2019re conservative enough and protecting the system while we\u2019re making these decisions in an accelerated time scale?     I can go through answering these three questions through my point of view, which I think indicates that wBTC is a very strong choice of collateral to be added in this context.   The answer to the first question: Custodial solutions for putting assets like BTC on Ethereum are basically one of the main ways that you can get exposure to Bitcoin through Ethereum and on MakerDAO. There are other solutions that people are also working on that are more technically sophisticated and have some tradeoffs, but I think over time, it\u2019s become pretty clear this custodial solution is one of the main ones.   The question of whether or not to tap into BTC as collateral in general, I think almost everyone agrees that that\u2019s something that we want because the BTC lending market and BTC trading, financing, derivatives, and so on are just really huge markets, even compared to ETH. So there\u2019s really nothing bigger than BTC when it comes to cryptocurrencies. And I gave some numbers there in my post, but basically, if you look at Bitcoin derivatives, and futures, and swaps, you will see that open interest for those products is probably over five times that of ETH, and ETH coming at number 2. And ETH is our number one asset right now, so that clearly indicates that there\u2019s a lot more potential with the BTC. Likewise, the lending market for BTC is also much bigger, so when it comes to leverage seekers, which are people who would issue Dai, there\u2019s maybe heuristically like 5 BTC leverage seekers for every single ETH leverage seeker. So clearly, we would want wBTC at some point.   Going to point number 2, whether or not we could actually really see enough Dai created against wBTC, I believe there\u2019s a good chance that we will. I have 3 points there.   The massive size of the BTC lending market and the margin trading and derivatives markets. Even relative to ETH, there\u2019s really no other asset in cryptocurrency that comes close. There have been other assets under discussion, and for those assets is very hard to make the case that they could come anywhere close to ETH in terms of how much demand there would be for minting Dai,  BTC is the only exception to that.   The second point is about rate arbitrage. We have the ability through monetary policy to set very low rates in order to encourage Dai creation, and whenever you do that, you\u2019re opening the opportunity for someone who\u2019s currently borrowing those BTC at higher rates, you are creating the opportunity to refinance there. If we choose the rates correctly, there will be a lot of people out there who have an outstanding debt against BTC. And then it\u2019s just a question of how well they will be able to access vaults, and how well will they be able to access wBTC. But the demand is necessarily there.   The last point, I\u2019ve been speaking to traders, lenders, desks and so on who deal with BTC and I\u2019ve seen a very positive response, specifically about wBTC as a vehicle, and also just in general, to be able to refinance BTC collateralized debt using vaults, were that to become available.   In the third point, I proposed some risk parameters for discussion. I think the most important thing there is to carry over as much as we know from ETH because the BTC market is not that different. Choose a Stability Fee that will make sure that refinancing is still attractive, so we have to be very competitive with the existing lending markets. And lastly is to make sure that we do manage the uncertainty of the custodian risk and, just, in general, the uncertainty from having gone through this accelerated process with a conservative choice of Debt Ceiling not to overextend ourselves there and basically choose a debt ceiling that we would be very happy to see filled up and we think that that would materially help the peg, but not go too far because of the constraints on the process right now. And that\u2019s about it.       I would like to have the opportunity to have a discussion and hear some questions about this, and there are also a couple of people on this call from the wBTC and the lending communities who might be able to answer some of these questions or have something to say. I think Kirash is here from BitGo. BitGo is the custodian of wBTC. We also have Matt from CoinList, which is a lending desk, also one of the largest wBTC market makers. I\u2019d like to turn it over now to anyone that has questions about this RFC.   Questions and Comments 1 30:10   Cryptowanderer: You mentioned in the chats that you guys run an 8 of 11 multi-sig wallets to add any potential market-makers or custodians - I forget the terminology that you use - that currently there is a smaller subset, including Kyber and Airswap and two others, that are actually running that wallet and that can redeem wBTC for ETH. Could you perhaps talk a little bit more about that?   Benedict Chan (BitGo, CTO): We have multiple roles in our ecosystem, and the people that can do redeems and mints, we call them merchants. You can view a list of them on the site wBTC.network, it\u2019s not just a few, it\u2019s quite a handful of them, but we actually see that CoinList has been really very instrumental in setting up a portal to do one-to-one mapping that we think is far better than going through a merchant today. I think that\u2019s quite hopeful, so maybe Matt from CoinList can explain more there.   Matthieu Jobbe Duval (CoinList, Head of Financial Products): Thanks, Ben. The idea that we had a couple of months ago was that the wBTC minting and redeeming process has been optimized for institutions. BitGo decided to go with a merchant model where only KYCed entities onboarded via the DAO would be able to access wBTC. However that was designed, correct me if I\u2019m wrong Ben, with the upticks that those merchants would mint large quantities of wBTC and then make it available to their final users via either an order book like Kyber, DDEX, or Diversify or via a wrapping-unwrapping functionality, which is exactly what CoinList has put in place. Of course, these platforms, Kyber, etc., they support wBTC, but they do many other things, so they are not necessarily optimized for user-friendliness specifically on that asset as they\u2019ve been very successfully running other initiatives.   CoinList was in a unique position to simplify the whole process for retail users because we have access to extremely cheap BTC funding, uncollateralized, so we essentially minted a large portion of wBTC - about 25% of the overall wBTC issuance has been minted by CoinList. These were then made available to market makers and retail users. So at the moment, anyone who would want to access the asset simply needs to create an account at Coinlist, for example, and hit \u201cwrap\u201d button paying a small fee, either a fixed fee of 0.25% for retail users or a decreasing fee for entities trading with us. Of course, you might think that only CoinList is doing this, so what if CoinList disappears or goes away or pulls the plug on the asset? Now, what we\u2019ve seen is that business is providing liquidity of an asset without any market risk attached to it of course because all trades are BTC vs. wBTC or vice versa, there is no actual market risk or credit risk involved in the loans, there are no margin calls of course - the assets are pegged one-to-one.   If we are doing it and being profitable with that business, it\u2019s going to attract other counterparties, it\u2019s going to attract other market makers supporting that same exact functionality, and the fees are going to be driven down. So, overall, this is only the start for this asset and for this access, and having Maker allowing wBTC as an asset will only bring more limelight to this part of the ecosystem in really bridging in a very efficient manner the BTC world and penetration in the retail crypto-portfolios with DeFi and what Maker is trying to achieve.       34:35   Rich Brown: I can throw a bit of a curveball here, so forgive me for this. Bitcoin tokenized on an Ethereum blockchain is sort of a Holy Grail. We\u2019ve been all (well, I should not speak for all the people) I\u2019ve been anxiously waiting for a long time now, and wBTC has been out for a while now. You spoke to one of the issues you have faced or maybe a solution to one of the adoption issues you faced with encouraging retail users to get involved, but can you speak to some of the other reasons why you think that wBTC didn\u2019t explode out of the gate like what are some of the challenges you\u2019ve seen so far in acquiring liquidity because I\u2019m looking at the network has a 1,000 BTC right now, is that correct?   Kirash: To be honest, my perspective is that wBTC is not a HODL coin. If you want to hold Bitcoin, there is no point in getting wBTC. If you\u2019re getting it, you want to do things with it, such as, use it in financial applications. The demand is partially generated from those financial applications supporting wBTC. That has been growing, and it\u2019s a snowball effect with market makers coming along and new applications supporting it. We\u2019ve seen this growth and actually a big part of it, I think Akash brought up this point, is the biggest use case for wBTC is Maker.   RB: That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to wrap my head around as well. I\u2019ll say it again, I\u2019m not a sophisticated financial thinker, but there is some part of me that wonders, \"Is there some circular risk going on where the case that the success\u2026a rapid adoption of wBTC would be spurred by its addition as a collateral type in Maker, but we have to add it as a collateral type in Maker to increase the adoption of wBTC, so potentially the protocol becomes a significant factor in that success of the token. Is there some kind of circular dependencies here that should be concerning to us?   Lev: I think it\u2019s very important to keep things reasonable with the choice of debt ceiling, in particular, to make sure that we don\u2019t end up in a situation where wBTC has growing pains, where we\u2019ve essentially allowed it to be used in Maker to such an extent that the rest of the infrastructure can\u2019t keep up, and then something may start to strain on the create-redeem process or liquidity or somewhere else. If we were considering it as an emergency collateral type, rather than collateral type through the MIP 6 process later, I would choose a debt ceiling where we thought we would make a material impact on the peg, just like with any of these emergency assets, but one which still is not going to involve the wBTC supply going up 10x as a result and having 90% in Maker, or anything like that. And, I think that a debt ceiling in a five to ten million Dai range would be neither of those things. The other thing to consider with the existing use of wBTC is that the two largest lending market makers, by far largest in DeFi, Maker and Compound, neither support wBTC collateral. Some smaller ones, newer ones, like Aave, do allow you to borrow against wBTC, but to the larger extent, it hasn\u2019t really had this adoption because it hasn\u2019t had a chance in one of the larger applications.   Rich Brown: Thanks for that, makes sense.     ",

                    "content": "38:43   Lev: I wanted to ask one thing about how to record this RFC, and I\u2019d like to hear the community\u2019s view. I think it would be nice to have a poll in the forum about some of these questions considering wBTC. There\u2019ve obviously also been polls in the context of the state of the peg emergency situation. But, essentially, what is the information we want to tease out from the sentiment is the answers to these three questions? Who agrees and disagrees about wBTC being a viable asset and being a helpful asset in this emergency, what people think about risk parameters, or is there some other thing that we should try to gauge?   RB: Well, Cyrus, you have been sort of shepherding the forum thread in the collateral type polling so far, so how does this fit into that model?   CY: That\u2019s kind of an open question to be honest, as it\u2019s somewhat of an unprecedented situation that we\u2019re in. As far as emergency measures go in trying to help save the peg, we just do due diligence up to the point that we can and then take it from there. In terms of forum threads and governance polls, I think we can figure that stuff out offline. I don\u2019t really think we have a clear understanding of what that would look like as of right now. We still have to hear from the engineering team about timelines and feasibility of turnaround time for adding a new collateral type such as wrapped Bitcoin. It may take a few days up to a few weeks. So depending on that process, we would structure forum polls and the governance polls differently based on the amount of time we have. The short answer is that I don\u2019t know right now, but we\u2019ll be monitoring it and helping to facilitate the process as we get more information.   Mariano Conti: I can speak to that later, but I would say one of my concerns is: is there going to be enough market makers to bid on liquidations of wBTC should they happen?   Cmooney: I was just looking at that myself. It looks on DEXes like there is about 50 BTC of liquidity before you get massive slippage right now.   RB: There are liquidity issues, but there are also the turnaround issues, and there is a process involved: my assumption is that there is some kind of redemption process, which is different than the way that the auctions are designed right now, where we\u2019re expecting that in a short period of time liquidity is available. Is there going to be an issue with the way that redemption works with wBTC?   Matthieu: Right now, talking about minting, you could get, if you\u2019re an onboarding entity, 105 wBTC in your wallet in about 2 minutes, maybe less, automatically 24/7 without any human involvement. 105 is nice, but this pool will grow as the market grows. If Maker onboards us as collateral, it would undoubtedly grow. It can grow to 500 or 1,000 wBTC in a few days. There is really no limit to how much Bitcoin we can source. Burning is exactly the same thing; it\u2019s actually even faster, probably a few seconds. You would send us wBTC, we redeem it for BTC - not just us, but other people would also do that as the market grows.     Rich Brown: There needs to be some kind of oracle for that correct? We can\u2019t allow the debt ceiling to exceed the amount of liquidity that\u2019s available. How is that measured, or how is that allocated?   Lev: I think it\u2019s important to understand how redemption works because that\u2019s relevant for liquidating collateral. Since when you liquidate, liquidators buy wBTC for Dai. As Matt explained, CoinList is a very active liquidity provider there, but they\u2019re not the only one. Anyone can go through KYC, if you\u2019re a trading firm or some market maker with the wBTC DAO and be allowed to redeem wBTC from Bitgo directly. The amount of wBTC that\u2019s redeemable there is the entire supply of wBTC. It\u2019s all backed 1 to 1 with Bitcoin, and you can redeem all of it if you wanted to. Someone from BitGo can confirm, but I would assume that\u2019s the case. But there are also people like CoinList who are providing this service at a faster turnaround and also exposing this functionality to any retail user who sets up an account with CoinList. In that sense, it\u2019s very similar to the process with USDC - you can also ask with USDC how to redeem USDC for USD? Anyone who has an account with Coinbase would be familiar with that process, where there is a button that converts your USDC to USD in any amount that you desire. In that sense, the analogy there is that CoinList is like Coinbase and Centre, the company that issues USDC, is like BitGo.   CY: Is the Coinlist custody different than the Bitcoin custody?   Lev: To be clear, CoinList isn\u2019t a custodian. It\u2019s just the liquidity provider that essentially stands up in front of a retail user and says, \u201cI\u2019ll exchange your wBTC for BTC or vice versa.\u201d The only custodian of wBTC today is BitGo, I believe.     45:07   Cyrus Younessi: Can the BitGo people chime in on any insurance coverage that you guys have regarding the deposits? I think you guys have some docs that maybe you can share later in the forums as well? Maybe talk a little bit about what would happen in case of hacks, bankruptcies, or any other such situations?  Kirash: Sure. It\u2019s one of the most comprehensive crypto-insurance policies in the industry and possibly one of the first. Every cold storage BitGo wallet is insured up to $100 million. And of course, you don\u2019t leave more than 100M in a wallet. I\u2019ll be happy to share some docs, and there\u2019s obviously a route to very cheaply increase that insurance policy as well.    Rich Brown: Who\u2019s providing the insurance?   Kirash: It\u2019s Lloyds. Just to echo what Lev mentioned earlier, if you run into the same issue where you need to get rid of a lot of USDC, you don\u2019t necessarily always interact with Centre. You go through Coinbase. If Coinbase\u2019s buffer isn\u2019t enough, then they will interact with Centre. The timelines of Coinbase interacting with Centre is very much the same as CoinList interacting with BitGo. As there is no wiring, because the USDC is wired to Center, it\u2019s actually faster. Not every wBTC that ends up on Maker is going to come through us. This merchants\u2019 system is designed for the liquidity providers to be independent of the custodian.   Benedict Chan: I can confirm that that\u2019s right. The idea here is that BitGo has all the BTC behind wBTC. It\u2019s publicly auditable, you can check the site for it, and we actually do regular, scheduled audits every month. The reason why CoinList is stepping in here and they are so valuable is because a good amount of wBTC is held in cold storage. Just like Circle probably has a certain amount of time that it needs to take to redeem USDC there, we would not be best to target for retail in terms of the amount of delays that it would take to redeem wBTC with us. Merchants can do that no problem - it\u2019s a balanced trade-off that we make for security purposes because of the cold wallets.   JoeQ: I wanted to say one thing: we\u2019re making a market in wBTC on Oasis, which is not doing that much, but we were the first ones to put wBTC in size onto Uniswap. I\u2019m all for putting all sorts of Bitcoin on there, besides the wBTC, Ren, tBTC. I think that Lev pushing for this is a great idea, and we should do it, but it comes down to what Mariano said: we need people (and this is across the board as we add collateral types) to be there for collateral auctions when they happen. Now the auction duration is six hours, so it\u2019s fine, but as we grow the system, we need more people to participate in that.   LongForWisdom: Presumably, the merchants and liquidity providers that were mentioned are incentivized to act as keepers as well, if they can get wBTC for less than the price of Bitcoin. They can take it and swap or whatever. Is that correct?   BC: I would say so. I would do it if I were a keeper or a merchant. Bitcoin is arguably one of the more stable crypto assets, compared to many others.   Cmooney: Would any of you be willing to commit to running an auction keeper for wBTC?   AndyChorlian: That\u2019s a pretty large monetary commitment, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a fair thing to ask someone.   Lev: I\u2019m definitely aware of people in the space who are involved with these kinds of things. We can take this discussion further, but I don\u2019t think it would be that hard to get an indication of interest in that.     50:52   CY: Just thinking about the roundtrip cycle for keepers. Even if you had an easy link between wrapped-Bitcoin and Bitcoin, easy redemption, or going from Bitcoin back to Dai is still somewhat of a challenge in this space, so it\u2019s definitely a more involved process than bidding on ETH.   Akash Patel: I kind of disagree with that. Let\u2019s just go through this process: you start with Dai and the merchants, who we handed the GUI for auctions that are now 6 hours, if you just handed them the manual GUI, where they could bid a reasonable price (and it would be great if they were running a keeper, but if that\u2019s too much even the manual GUI would help), they bid with Dai, they win the wBTC, they convert it through a couple of mechanisms now, either CoinList or the redemption process through BitGo. They get BTC, go to Coinbase and sell that BTC for USD, which they can easily convert to USDC; they can bring that USDC back to MakerDAO, mint Dai. We\u2019re talking about a stressful situation - they bring that USDC, mint Dai through MakerDAO, and they\u2019re back to Dai again.   LFW: There\u2019s also a USDC<>DAI market on Coinbase, which they could use.   Lev: Couple of things. One is that you have much longer confirmation times with Bitcoin when you\u2019re sending it to Coinbase. That\u2019s probably an additional hour right there. In the best case, which isn\u2019t too common, if you buy ETH in an auction, you can flip it straight back into Dai via Oasis or Uniswap. Whereas with wrap BTC if you don\u2019t have that wrapped BTC liquidity on the DEXes, which we don\u2019t today, then you have to go through the process you described. You don\u2019t have the option of making a quicker roundtrip.   MJD: The thing is that you can hedge with BTC<>DAI or BTC<>USDC. You don\u2019t need wBTC since it\u2019s 1:1 is guaranteed.   CY: The key for us is that we want to end up in a position where the keepers have Dai in their hands again for subsequent auctions, that\u2019s really where the cycle ends.   MJD: But then, they can just hedge the price exposure with whatever they like, and then it can be diversified. It can be Kyber or Coinbase to recycle and get Dai in their hands again.   BC: Would they not just buy Dai on Coinbase?   CY: It\u2019s not only the price exposure. We actually need keepers to have Dai in their hands so that they could bid on subsequent rounds of auctions. Hedging the price exposure wouldn\u2019t help in that sense, and going to Coinbase to buy Dai would involve sending the Bitcoin to Coinbase, which is just slightly longer process than ETH, speaking purely from confirmation times.   Lev: I think you have a good point there, especially from the confirmation times. The average wait time on a Coinbase deposit is higher than it is for ETH. To elaborate for other people, Cyrus is talking about needing to go full circle without any external financing. If you have a keeper with access to financing, with enough capital, they don\u2019t need to go full circle to liquidate something. Just as they\u2019re buying one batch of wBTC and starting that process, they can already be buying more Dai with cash they have anywhere. And keep going. We saw this in Black Thursday where a strain on the whole system hit keepers with capital strains, not enough access to Dai in the time available, and not enough liquidity in a 10-minute short window, which is why it\u2019s so important that the auction parameters have changed. With where they are now, it\u2019s more sensible for any asset.   Lev: The other thing I want to mention is DeversiFi. It\u2019s a DEX that is also a wBTC merchant and is also pushing for trading with wBTC exposure on their platform. They\u2019re similar to CoinList, where they\u2019re making wBTC available by mirroring bitFinex BTC orderbooks. They\u2019ve got reserves of BTC and wBTC to bridge these two exchanges. There\u2019s actually already deeper wBTC liquidity available on DEXes than you would expect thanks to them.   Lev: Lastly, it\u2019s worth mentioning that DyDx is launching this BTC perpetual swap product. It\u2019s a step forward in people trading BTC-type products on DEXes and provides a venue where traders are able to hedge BTC exposure if they are stuck somewhere in this loop because you can actually go short BTC with 10x leverage on DyDx while holding that wBTC that you just liquidated and you\u2019re trying to make this full loop. That\u2019s kind of interesting and not something you were able to do before.   LFW: We can have different auction parameters for BTC Vaults, we could extend times specifically for those if we felt that would work better.   Lev: That\u2019s true. I think in general, it\u2019s very wise to think about total round trip redemption time, confirmation times on other blockchains when you\u2019re thinking of auction parameters. You have to think about the worst-case scenario. If all liquidity and financing have dried up, you have to have participants who will be able to do a full cycle.   Akash: Adding USDC as a collateral type greatly helps in stressful times. The biggest issue was the USDC<>DAI conversion. Now that you\u2019re not stressing the Coinbase market, just minting it will alleviate a lot of the problems that we were seeing.   LFW: Sounds like that\u2019s a good point to end that segment. Maybe we should move on.   RB: Was just going to say the same. Let\u2019s figure out the next steps before we just change the subject. Lev has helpfully put up a forum thread to discuss wBTC. The concerns, questions, and compliments that wBTC received in this conversation should be reflected there so we can all internalize it over a longer time frame. Let\u2019s do a call back to what I mentioned at the top of the hour, how we figure out moving from intention to implementation. Earlier, I raised some of the issues we\u2019ll need to address on this path. Recourse, redemption, auction keepers; that\u2019s the first rabbit hole we went down, but I\u2019m betting there are more to address. Let\u2019s treat this as a project, to identify the stakeholders, that we understand the implications, and that there is a plan to make it happen if that\u2019s what people want. Please, join us on the forums.     Analysis Vishesh The State of the Pegs 1:00:56  1042\u00d7506 50.7 KB    We saw a huge haircut in ETH/DAI supply following the events of March 12th.   From March 19th to April 7th, we saw that the Dai supply steadily started to increase. In the same timeframe, we saw elevated Dai price coming down from highs around $1.07/ or $1.05 steadily back to $1.01.    1050\u00d7506 48.5 KB   Around April 8th, there was a sudden dip of a few million in the Dai supply. Not much minting going on at that time.   1061\u00d7487 141 KB    This corresponded to ETH\u2019s price being flat and increasing slightly, with a sudden jump on the 7th. After that sudden jump, Dai rose in minting activity but with a bit of a holding pattern. As that ETH price came up, there was some potential concern that it would come back down, many people took at $1.01 price as an opportunity to pay down some debt and basically that led to a dip in the Dai supply.   Because ETH was flat for a few days, that Dai price was holding at $1.02. No new people were coming in and minting new Dai or market-making from Dai reserves that they were sitting on since many people got cleared out from all the crash events. Dai was sitting at $1.02 for about eight days.   Dai above peg presented a lot of concerns for a lot of people. Though what\u2019s interesting is that in the last few days the average price was coming down very slightly, about another cent or so. There were some high trades on Oasis today, but if you look at the current DyDx order books, Dai is trading around $1.015.      1074\u00d7528 148 KB    Dai is trading around $1.015.  The freeze in the reduction of the Peg is explainable. In terms of what happens from here, with increasing ETH price, is still uncertain. Dai is very sensitive to movements in ETH price. Everything that has been happening with Dai can be pretty well explained by reductions in reserves, uncertainty with market-making capabilities though market-making capabilities can be attributed to market conditions vs. endogenous system risk. That trade-off is something I would be mindful of, most of this is likely effected by external market factors affecting time-sensitive sentiment on leverage.    Though there was that sharp drop in Dai supply, it does seem to be trending upward in the last couple of days.    1257\u00d7303 81 KB    Up to 86 million Dai from ETH. Compared to supply from a couple of weeks ago, it is up about 10 million. Appears to be loosening up, which is a positive indicator. Especially for worries about the peg perpetually staying up.   It\u2019s potentially more difficult for Dai to move from $1.04 to $1.02 versus back down to $1.01. Then it is for moving $1.01 back down to $1.00. In terms of expectations for a further decrease in the peg, this isn\u2019t necessarily a linear trend, and I think it does appear to have loosened up again.    804\u00d7542 207 KB    This graph is good context for price performance over the past few months, with insane events occurring in mid-march and then a slight trend downward towards normalization.   In terms of more granular normalization, and what happens in the next few days will be more important data points.   If this supply increase continues to trend, and if the peg does trade lower, those are positive indicators for Dai.   Questions and Comments 2 1:07:25   Cryptowanderer: what is your opinion on the current ETH debt ceiling, are we all good? Or is an increase in order?   Vishesh: DC is an important parameter to talk about. The buffer in the DC is important to manage. This isn\u2019t a new conversation. The ETH DC is $90 million. There is currently $86 million Dai. As far as the likelihood of hitting $90 Million, at the current rate, the trend could continue, and we could hit the DC. Potentially some increase is worth talking about.   The conversation has been had many times in this call about how to programmatically maintain the buffer. The general point that I want to make is that you want to obviously maintain a bit of slack to not hit the DC, but you don\u2019t want too much room since it introduces more risk. Say if another ETH price drop happened, you would not want an excess $30 million DC buffer because there are scenarios that could lead to further losses. It\u2019s something to balance. You want to keep some room but not too much room. I think the conversation and many forum polls were had in the past around what exact buffer needs to be maintained. So this isn\u2019t something that I can decide right here.   LFW: Something that should come up.   V: It is close; that\u2019s for sure.     01:09:41   MM: Are you against upping it? Maybe 5 million or something? Do you have something against it?   V: I don\u2019t think increasing the DC about 5 million for ETH/DAi is a significant risk. The point I want to make is that rather than making specific one-off determinations, there are already conversations regarding rough percentages, or nominal numbers, about DC buffer amounts. In this specific case, I don\u2019t think a $5 million increase is a bad idea, and there are reasonable arguments to be made for doing that.   MM: Is there an actionable item? At some point, we\u2019re gonna hit the ceiling unless we hit a market downturn or something. Hearing an opinion that doing 5 million wouldn\u2019t bother you is important. I think we should do it. Given what\u2019s going on with the peg and Dai liquidity, I\u2019d rather not get pegged on the DC limit on ETH, and be stuck with USDC at 6 percent and BAT that no one is touching.   LFW: We should consider, if there are a bunch of changes come Friday, that we should probably increase the DC at the same time.   MM: I think what Vishesh is saying that we should decide what kind of buffer we need and maintain it. I have this model for facility rate usage, a model that manages the utilization. The rate that the market is telling you, based on that model, will help you determine where to nudge it. I already posted about this opinion, but I do want to second Vishesh\u2019s point about a comfortable buffer, probably as a percent of float, and go from there.   LFW: It would be good to pick a number if the change is gonna come quickly. Probably something that needs to go on the forums.   MM: Just as an actionable item: can we put up a poll to raise the DC from $90 Million to $95 Million or maybe even to a $100 Million since Vishesh doesn\u2019t want to raise above $5 Million?   V: I\u2019m not saying that 5 or 10 are specific problems. There are Governance questions around what the precise buffer you want to maintain. There are specific questions that are answerable. Is it reasonably likely that we hit 90 in a week or two? That is reasonably likely based on current trends. But trends could also change.  The other point is that, once there is a programmatic decision regarding the DC buffer either percentage or minimal, then you don\u2019t need someone like me to say: You should increase by 5 million now or 10 million now. Those are questions for gov polls. Does that make sense?    Maker Man: Yeah, sounds ok to me. Just wondering if there was an actionable item for Rich and Governance. I understand your point.   LongForWisdom: Side chat is talking about whether an increase is urgent enough to increase in the Friday gov call. Based on the rate increase, and the rate of total Dai increase, it\u2019s been high over the past few days, somewhere around $2.5 Million.   V: I don\u2019t think there is an urgent situation here. No clear, specific problem at the moment. But given the rate of increase, it is potentially likely that you hit the $90 million within the next week or so at the current rate. Whether you want to change the process to account for that, well, that is a governance question. I don\u2019t think, either way, that there is a large specific risk there.   Rich: Something to consider too is the significant number of polls and activities that are culminating in the portal an hour or so ago, that are designed to increase liquidity and increase Dai creation.     1:16:34   Cyrus: Some other considerations. Tomorrow, SCD shutdown is initiating. There is a three-week delay before it actually goes into effect. Tomorrow the vote goes out, but it doesn\u2019t actually happen for three weeks. Additionally, the MKR Oracle price feed is being disabled, which is designed to allow fee-less migration. We want migration to be incentivized to occur without fees, such that the migration contract to be drained, which would otherwise be a burden for the protocol when SCD is shutdown in three weeks. Given that the incentive period starts tomorrow, it is likely that we see an uptick in migration from SCD eating away at the 2.4 million Dai. That in itself would eat up the remaining Debt Ceiling, which would limit fresh Dai generation off of ETH.   Vishesh: Given the delay involved, it makes sense for an earlier increase.   Cyrus: If we do hit the DC, I think there is a chance that we run into some problems in terms of the peg. This is not the time to put a cap against Dai generation from ETH, especially given the rising market, and people want to mint Dai. I think governance should try to make this happen. That would look like a mid-week executive vote. At this rate, maybe even a mid-weekend poll. It certainly would be helpful to include a small DC increase in the executive. May be too much in terms of Governance.   LFW: I think it\u2019s ok, we\u2019ve done similar things before. There is a reason for this. The arguments are heavily weighted to acting sooner. The whole purpose of breaking the process to make changes with a specific goal. It makes sense to do the DC as well.   MM: I\u2019d say let us put it up right now. If anyone is opposed, we should hear from them. Otherwise, we are all in agreement.   Cyrus: That\u2019s exactly what we want to caution against. This call isn\u2019t designed for making decisions. This is just a discussion medium. The majority of governance happens in the forums, and we should continue to do so. It may not be possible, but we may try to include this in the executive tomorrow.   Rich: I agree, we have a very select group of individuals on this call. North-Americans who have nothing to do at this time of day, and they all speak English. Let\u2019s be cautious about using this as a decision-making platform. We also have empowered actors in this system here. The risk team has been empowered by the community to be domain experts. Actually, we haven\u2019t talked about this in a long time. SCD still exists, and MCD is still on a long road to get ramped up as part of the MCD proposal. The risk team still is ratified to make decisions regarding the protocol. Particularly, if we have a series of initiatives that are intended to increase liquidity, yet we have a parameter that caps liquidity that we forgot about. That is slightly counterproductive. Let\u2019s perhaps try to experiment by giving people an opportunity to say no as opposed to people just trying to say yes.   CY: I\u2019ll put up a thread after the call.   LFW: Maker holders can have a chance to say no by just not voting. They can always just not vote for it.   Rich: I think raising ETH DC is less controversial than the changes happening with USDC vaults.     Rich: We\u2019re 30 minutes into Q & A, and we\u2019ve gone over a lot with tons to wrap up. Ten polls are completed. There is an action that the community wants us to take on Friday. Please go to the forums and bring as much consensus as possible.

My name is Richard Brown, and I am the head of community development at MakerDAO. Today we have a wide range of projects to get to. Part of the regrouping after the events over the last couple of weeks will be interesting to watch. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been noticing:   Over the last few months, we run through the urgency/apathy/denial cycle. Maybe we\u2019ll take on a new cycle; urgency, apathy/denial, and \u201cactivity,\u201d possibly?   We know we have to do something rapidly, that\u2019s the urgency. That thing gets done, or something else happens that\u2019s the apathy stage. The problem goes away; that\u2019s the denial stage. And then the activity stage, when some new event comes along. Then we focus all our attention there.   That\u2019s a fundamental flaw in human nature and humans in general: it\u2019s hard for us to hold a number of dissociated ideas in our heads at the same time, and maintaining these threads over months and weeks is a huge ask.   With the way that our governance ecosystem needs to develop in the future, we\u2019re going to have to come up with some plans and some processes to come back and revisit things that were important that got shelved. We\u2019ll start doing a better job at predicting what will happen in the future, and have initiatives split off to address those things. One of the many painful teaching moments that we\u2019ve all experienced over the course of the last few weeks is going to help us make the system more robust. We\u2019re already seeing evidence of that happening. Today, we have too many different things to talk about and not enough time to talk about them. Frequently we pick one or two big subjects and dig into those.     Today we have maybe 7 or 8 big subjects. These are extremely healthy, growing pains. What that means is that the community is increasingly improving its ability to self coordinate and it\u2019s sophistication. It\u2019s identifying problems that need to be solved and then coming up with plans to solve them. That is precisely what this Governance ecosystem should be about. It\u2019s not top-down, it\u2019s flat. It\u2019s not centralized. It\u2019s decentralized. And it\u2019s being kick-started, so it\u2019s easy to pick it apart and find what\u2019s wrong.  I\u2019m more focused on how it\u2019s improving on a week to week basis. And this is one of those improvements that\u2019s making me very, very happy. I\u2019m not going to talk too much about how happy that makes me. Instead, let\u2019s talk about what the agenda today and break out into discussion.    Kurt will recap the flop auction poll from the forums, there was a decision to be made last week, actually, sorry, earlier in the week, at our last Governance call, about whether there is a second executive or whether they get bundled. There were some issues there. There was also a tweak or an added feature that could impose a delay to make this entire process more rational.   Rich Cueller Lopez will tell us about an ES shutdown working group / DeFi space consortium. This is a really great initiative and won\u2019t get into it too much because he\u2019s given it far more thought than I have. The idea is that we have stakeholders in this space, and they are impacted by the decision of this community. We need to engage with those stakeholders. And well, a hero has arisen.   Mariano Conti is going to tell us about new some recent events in MKR token authority world. I believe people should be excited to hear about if they haven\u2019t already. I know I\u2019m excited.   LFW will talk about Forum at a glance. Possibly about USDC SFs. I\u2019ll leave that to him.   Marko is going to talk about some analysis he did on USDC.   We\u2019ll try to get back to some normalcy here and have the comforting tones of Vishesh walking us through the state of pegs and Primoz giving us a review of the state of migration. Obviously, lots to go through and lots of disparate chats.   As always, in these calls, this is not a decision-making forum, it\u2019s a broadcasting and information and discovery tool for ideas and where brainstorming happens. Then we move into the forums, and that\u2019s where proposals are written, a consensus is reached, and the next steps get determined. Let\u2019s do our best to get through our agenda today. Let\u2019s ensure that we all break off to forum posts and meetings afterward.   Discussions happen in the Forum. where we find consensus.   Recap of Flop Auction poll Kurt 6:42  1014\u00d7481 115 KB    Recap: On Tuesday, we discussed unblocking the flop auctions as well as the technical details for how they got blocked. One option is to create two executives: one executive for unblocking debt auctions and one for the usual monetary policy. The cadence would be that the unblocking spell would come first and then after a potential monetary policy vote. The other options were to have one executive vote for everything, or one executive vote on Friday only to unblock flop auction. The leading option in the poll is to have two executives, as first mentioned.   In order to avoid the same bug that prevented the flop auctions, the proposed spell will not only convert the debt into a form that can start the flop auctions but also kick off the flop-auctions as soon as it is cast. None of them will be blocked, and we will be in good shape.   But there is a further consideration in relation to the timing of things. It is hard to predict the time of a spell being cast because it relies on people voting things in. These aren\u2019t great conditions for the auction participants because people must be standing-by 24 hours a day, and would lead to an asymmetrical benefit to auction participants depending on time zones. Due to the governance delay, there would still be at least 4 hours of warning before the auctions start, but to ensure maximum efficiency of participation, the spell will kick off all the auctions at a predictable time.   Questions and Comments 1 11:00   Rich: Quite a bit of discussion in the sidebar. To summarize, there is an issue at play, and I touched on this in the last call. If we split these executives, there is this gun that we can only fire once a week. The clock starts ticking the second after we put this executive into the portal, which will have to happen right after this call. This would give the ecosystem less than 24 hours to assemble their hardware wallets and pass the vote. There is some campaigning that needs to happen to rally the vote in the very small window we have. If people feel strongly that this needs to go through, please, I encourage you to: a) actually come and vote, even if you are a smaller holder. It\u2019s worth voting, even if you\u2019re not a whale. Whales follow the crowd here. If you know large holders, consider convincing them to vote. Consider doing some public campaigning. If people want the vote to pass, take to the twitters and sharpen your pitchforks and sharpen your PR skills. Otherwise, it won\u2019t happen.   LFW: There are some discussions of pros/cons of doing two votes. It splits MKR. There is also the conversation of SCD being susceptible to flash loan attacks.   Rich: This is another long discussion regarding the apathy/urgency/denial cycle. We\u2019re seeing some cracks in the mechanism of continuous approval voting. We\u2019ve been seeing those cracks for a long time; this is one of the things we as a community need to revisit sometime soon. As the complexity of our governance ecosystem ramps up, almost exponentially, is the system that we have in place right now going to cover us?  I don\u2019t expect answers right now. But we\u2019ve asked these questions four or five times now, and we are back in the same place: where something important needs to happen, how do we do that in a way that does not risk a weak executive or reduces the security of this system or splits the vote.    Kurt: In this particular case, it\u2019s a question of whether we have much monetary policy to enforce. Rates are zero. I\u2019ve seen discussion of tweaking debt ceilings. Do we expect any of that to have a large effect on the system or is any of that urgent compared to getting a million in bad debt cleared and freeing up however much Dai is being held on the sideline with the intention of participating in these auctions. Remember, even if we only have two people competing, two entities competing, you are locking up at least twice the amount of Dai that is going to be consumed in the auctions assuming they are gunning to win them all.   Rich: You raise a good point. I call it a good point because it reinforces the point I just made, so it has to be good. In the before times, about 3-4 weeks ago, we discussed the cadence of monetary policy as well. We discussed pulling information from models and empirical evidence to determine whether the levers we pull have the impact that we assume they do. It is possible that moving the number up or down once percent every week may not be having the impact that we assume it is. Perhaps, in the absence of a more nuanced voting mechanism, maybe we can free up every second week to discuss non-monetary policy. That is a discussion that is worth having very soon. Kurt, do you have any other points?   Kurt: I think that covers the state of things. If I have a soapbox, I think that the most important thing we can do for the system is to clear the remaining bad debt through flop auctions. It\u2019s not clear if people holding Dai to participate in those will have an upward pressure on the peg or not, but we can empirically find out. If that has anything to do, we should get that cleared. And it isn\u2019t even clear to me if there are other actions that we need to take that are on the same order of magnitude and importance.   LFW: Do we need to discuss the delay at all? Do we want to delay the flop auctions to a certain time?   Kurt: The intention is to give them predictable start times. I\u2019m thinking about say, sometime between 9 am and noon on a weekday EST.   Rich: Does that require consensus? Can someone writing the spell pick a realistic weekday? It\u2019s about minimizing an absurd time.   Kurt: It creates certainty and predictability.   Rich: It\u2019s going to be hard to find something that works for everyone. As I continue to point out, we iterate here, and we don\u2019t set things in stone forever. We can just pick a reasonable time for now and have a longer discussion about that next week.     Emergency Shutdown Working Group Rich Cuellar-Lopez 18:38   The idea of a working group for Emergency Shutdown is really to create a framework and a roadmap for a DeFi consortium. Especially as it relates to MCD shutdown, we could discuss where Sai fits in right now or other parameters. But, really, if we had to use ES, what would it mean? It\u2019s more for gathering feedback and setting deliverables on a preliminary basis. More for people who aren\u2019t on this call aren\u2019t part of the foundation, or in the community.   What it\u2019s not: it\u2019s not trying to press the MakerDAO or token holders to immediately shut down anything. Or force anyone\u2019s hands to dictate or codify. We still want people to have the flexibility and encourage them to vote for what they think is sensible for shutdown. This group is to have that discussion on when would be sensible.   Who would be a part: Ideally it would be a couple of members from the DeFi community if you wanted to have people from Compound or Dharma or any big hitters you can. But anyone who\u2019s built on the Maker protocol could be a larger community.   Rich Brown: Let\u2019s break it down a bit: a)Let\u2019s clarify what the actual steps are and what this means b)Identify stakeholders in the ecosystem to try and build some bridges. We don\u2019t live in a vacuum here, right? So trying to understand who this affects and who should have a say is the point.   RCL: Right, initially identify people who have skin-in-the-game and people who ES affects what they\u2019re building. Where if there was an ES, how would it materially change things. Initially, we identify the key people and set a framework for what should be discussed pre-emptively, what should be happening during an ES, what can happen for others to recover after an ES. Having that whole timeline in place, so if anything happened suddenly, say next week, everyone could work off a common framework. Maybe we don\u2019t gain consensus, but the reality is, especially people outside this community, they\u2019re not going to want to jump on daily calls at weird times to discuss things in real-time.   Where we\u2019re at: There is a working group forum post to go up in the next few days. There\u2019s a doc right now to review this discussion. Ideally, people on this call can review, and then we\u2019ll post it for the public. If there are people who want to be part of this discussion, not regularly on these calls, we would appreciate those points of view. Send them my way so we can collaborate on this initial charter or framework and some of the deliverables we want to have.     RCL: Hit me up on Rocketchat: @rcl   Questions and Comments 2 23:08  Rich Brown: That\u2019s perfect, worth the extra minute. This is something I\u2019ve been nervous about for the longest time, a proverbial boogeyman in the system. A game-theoretical security mechanism that I don\u2019t think there is enough clarity on. Specifically what it actually means, and how it actually works, and when it should actually happen. It\u2019s a discussion we\u2019ve had every once in a while. I\u2019m glad that this project has seen some direct effort to derive some clarity, it\u2019s enormously valuable. Thanks for starting it up!  MKR token Authority Mariano Conti 24:38  1043\u00d7566 63.5 KB    The Maker Foundation multisig has relinquished ownership of the MKR token.   In single collateral Dai, the MKR Token is a database of how many tokens each address has. It also has some restricted functions, including MKR minting and burning. It also has two specific values, an owner and an authority. The owner was the foundation multisig. It didn\u2019t have any authority; authority can be a smart-contract with additional logic.   In SCD, we didn\u2019t really need anything too complicated because the MKR token was only used to pay for stability fees. They would go into the burner, termed the GemPit. This balance would grow but would not affect supply as it was never actually burned because no contract had the authority to do so.    978\u00d7597 166 KB    After releasing MCD, a governance delay was introduced, here termed PauseProxy.   For flop auctions, the contract required authority to mint MKR, and the flap auctions and GemPit needed authority to burn MKR. Therefore, an MKR authority was created.    1053\u00d7615 186 KB   This MKR authority gave authorizations to these three contracts. The flopper could then call mint so that the winner of the flop auction receives the MKR. The Flapper and GemPit use the authority that all addresses have to burn their own MKR.   1005\u00d7609 87.3 KB    Before yesterday, both the multisig and the MKR authority could call the restricted functions to mint or burn its own MKR, as well as change ownerships and authorities. Now, the multisig set the owner address to 0. This means that everything has to go through the MKR authority, which is owned by governance.   This doesn\u2019t seem like a big step but is incredibly powerful. Anything that needs to happen that needs authority must go through MKR voters.     To check, etherscan.io can be checked. The owner address is set to 0.   807\u00d766 6.24 KB     The root or owner for MKR authority is the Maker MCD Pause Proxy, aka Governance.   This is another big deal, and another reason to keep voting and keep participating. That is all I have.   Questions and Comments 3 30:22   Rich: Thank you, Mariano. It\u2019s painful that such a good thing happened at such a tumultuous time. Thank you for keeping the fire lit under this thing. I know that it has been a passion project of yours for a while.   Mariano: The first document drafted to do this is about a year and a half old.   Governance At a glance LongForWisdom 31:13   Suggestions for updating the Signaling Guidelines   Mitote made a thread about updating signaling guidelines. Everyone read and pay attention to what may change and what should change.   We\u2019re looking at what works well versus what hasn\u2019t gone well. Feedback is welcome.     Seeking signal   Kurt\u2019s thread about finishing blocked flops and structuring executives   Do we compensate vault holders that were completely liquidated?  This topic is not going away until we figure out what we\u2019re doing. Interestingly it\u2019s the biggest signal we\u2019ve ever had, presumably because of Vault owner participation.    SCD shutdown  Thread is still up. Derek lays out the rough series of steps for SCD ES and it went under the radar.    Questions and Comments 4 33:59   Aaron Bartsch: Does the foundation have any plans for SCD shutdown in place? I know there is a portal? Right now, polling is 64% in favor of 'less than a month from today. I want to make a poll for 2, 3, 4 weeks out regarding how many weeks out from today do we want to execute shutdown.   Rich: That\u2019s a great point, thanks for bringing it up. We\u2019ve had this discussion internally for a while, let me fill everyone in. For there to be a clear path for community to shutdown SCD, there are a few things that need to happen in concert, or at least in rapid succession. One of those is a clear understanding in the ecosystem of what mechanically needs to happen. What development needs to occur, what steps.   Letting the community wrap it\u2019s head around how feasible it is and in what time-frame. The community may want it in one day, but it turns out it\u2019s actually eight. Once the technical mechanisms are on the forums, it\u2019s my expectation that the community can align around a process to combine with the way the world works. Once that process exists, time estimations can start, and scheduling can begin. I could be off base, and I\u2019m willing to hear other opinions, but that feels like the order of operations.   What are the mechanical steps? How does the community wrap around that(smart contracts, etc.?) Then, how does the community align on a timeline? The foundation is working on docs that give a detailed break down of what it looks like mechanically, what different pieces need to happen, and in what order. Aaron, you and your team, will be able to figure out how that works. There is also possible alignment with \u201cother Rich(@rcl).\u201d Maybe everyone can coordinate together, it feels like a three-pronged approach that needs to happen.     LFW: Refer to the link to Derek\u2019s thread. It lists the steps that need to happen before SCD.   Derek: I\u2019ll make a new post that adds color and depth to those high-level steps. Aaron, to your question, I think internally, we\u2019re looking to the community to see when you collectively want to do the shutdown. I\u2019m building an SCD shutdown page, which will be part of the migration.makerdao.com; it\u2019s been in the works for a while and should finish tomorrow. Happy for you to put the poll up since we need that timing input.   Aaron: Perfect. Thanks for that!   LFW: So we need an on-chain poll to see if we shut down in a month?   Rich: Yup! I feel more confident in the process if Aaron, Derek, Rich, and whoever else was super interested in this process coordinated together to execute well on that poll.   Makermman: I\u2019d like to echo that, it\u2019s not clear if those steps are sequential or if the executives will be stepwise or bundled. If we can see that clearly, then we can see what the timeline will be and can vote accordingly.   Rich: Exactly, once the mechanism is understood, we could wrap Governance around that.   LFW: The poll could be indicative versus declarative. Agreeing on aim versus state.     40:29   Cyrus: How are we going to proceed operationally? Are we waiting on Derek? Or someone else for a high-level plan, or do we want to start with items that we know need to happen. E.g., stopping the Sai->Dai migration contract, just one way, not both ways. It is something that will have to happen anyways since it creates too many edge cases to keep that bridge open. I\u2019m not saying we have to do this immediately, or this is urgent but, given this is a multi-step process, I think we should try to move sooner rather than later.   Derek: I\u2019d be happy to look at SCD DC, independent of the ES plan. That precedes it.   Cyrus: Right, would that be as simple as setting the Sai migration DC to zero. Is that all it takes?   Derek: I think I need to understand possible implications with the smart contracts team and yourself. I don\u2019t know what that would do in terms of liquidity impact. From the comments I see in the sidebar, make sure I put it in a forum post, make sure people can review it. Long, I\u2019ll work with you on future messaging.   Cyrus: To clarify, two DCs being discussed: one is SCD DC, but the other is the Sai migration special collateral type in MCD. That\u2019s the one that needs to be set to zero to prevent further migration.   LFW: Derek, feel free to loop Aaron in on these things. In terms of messaging specifically, a couple of people volunteered to work on that.   Derek: Should we discuss moving DC to Zero?   Aaron: We could also put an on-chain poll on Monday and see the interest that way.   Cyrus: Ok, let\u2019s put up posts and gather feedback. Maybe we can put up a Governance Poll on Monday. Gonzalo says there are two ways to execute: set DC to zero or cage the Sai adapter.   Mariano: If you set the DC to zero, you can still change it back. If you cage it, that\u2019s a one-way street. We do want to freeze it, but in case we need to unfreeze it, it could be an issue to use the cage method. We\u2019ll get together and figure it out, then come back with more information.   Rich: This is the point where I\u2019ll hand it over to you, Cyrus.     Risk Cyrus 44:55   One topic that I wanted to discuss is revisiting USDC as there is a lot of buzz going around with USDC as a collateral type. I want to remind people that there is an active discussion going on about the use case of USDC, whether it is primarily used for Dai peg liquidity or emergency keeper liquidity.   The reason this is important is that we have seen usage in both use cases. We\u2019ve seen it used in flop auctions and in Dai peg management. The flop auctions are coming to a close, and Dai is still at one dollar.   People are still wondering how to get more Dai out of the USDC to help deal with the Dai peg. Which means lowering the SF in an effort to affect the peg.   LFW: The poll for the SF on USDC has finished with 17k MKR in favor of reducing it to 16%.   Cyrus: Governance poll passed for a reduction in SF. In a way, MKR voting is driving the narrative, so we need to catch up quickly.     Risk Data for USDC Marko 47:50  Hi, it is my first time speaking here, so here is some small introduction. I am primarily working with Primoz Kordez, who you already know. We are mainly focusing on analyzing the DeFi ecosystem. And for the last few months, I am also working with Cyrus and Vishesh.   1401\u00d7380 136 KB    Analyzing USDC vaults, interested in what people are doing with USDC backed Dai debt. Looking at the top 10 vaults, we have seen that a lot of the debt is concentrated in the top 10 vaults.   The first one is responsible for about 40% of the USDC backed Dai debt.   The ten vaults combined represent 90% of  USDC backed Dai debt    1812\u00d7707 96.8 KB   This chart shows the aggregate Dai minted per day. Dai minting activity was much stronger, starting in the first few days, and the largest vault has started repaying some of its debt.   1721\u00d7615 93.6 KB    Two main causes of so much early activity. In the initial days of introducing USDC collateral, Dai was trading stronger.   The other reason is debt auctions.   The most important part of this analysis is the activity of what the vaults are doing. I tried to label them based on their main activity.    816\u00d7247 158 KB   1154\u00d7730 68.5 KB   You can see that roughly 50% of debt is being issued toward accumulation. This is likely used as liquidity for auctions. Roughly 40% is used for managing the Dai premium, essentially selling Dai for USDC.     Five vaults are using iearn for leverage, which allows you to leverage your Dai short position in one transaction. Two are doing the same manually.   The first and fifth-largest vaults are accumulating Dai. The top account was connected to a separate account participating in the flop auctions. So it\u2019s likely a keeper.   Another quite important thing is that these two accounts, which are accumulating Dai, are related to accounts which are the largest players in Compound.   Dai premium is dangerous for Dai denominated debt on other protocols that aren\u2019t Maker. These protocols use market price, which means you can get liquidated faster in Compound than on Maker.      1146\u00d7557 98.1 KB   The largest vault is related to this address, which is the largest ETH supplier in Compound. This position is quite large, borrowing $3.7 Million Dai. CR is 576% (assuming Dai at 1), and his CR in Compound is 559%. It\u2019s lower than it would be if the position took Dai at exactly $1USD.    The fifth-largest vault is accumulating Dai too, related to a very large player in Compound supplying USDC and borrowing Dai. You can see the leverage is much higher since his CR is 164%.   850\u00d7244 161 KB   Accounts trading manually were basically using aggregators like Paraswap and 1inch to optimize slippage.  Questions and Comments 5 55:10   Cyrus: My main take away is half of the USDC is used for flop auctions (just guessing), and then half is being used for Dai peg liquidity. This continues the discussion on what we want USDC for. If we want to target both use cases, we should discuss separating these into two collateral types, with parameters and debt ceilings targeting each specific use case.   Cyrus: We should make sure that this conversation is still top of mind for the community. If we want to add another collateral type(USDC-A and USDC-B) or increase, decrease SF\u2019s. We need governance polls and executive votes to determine the path, but we could do a better job of staying on top of it.   Derek: For me, the key takeaway is we need to get the flop auctions off the table. In which case, do we still need to have a USDC-A and USDC-B?   Cyrus: We still would. Primarily we need to make sure there is sufficient Dai liquidity for keepers in case ETH suffers another drop for future auctions. That it is used for the flop auctions is a welcome side benefit, that would have been another $5 million Dai that would have been drained from the primary Dai supply. A fair framing is one type for flip and flop auctions and another for Dai peg management.     57:56   Wiliam Remor: Do you have any ideas about measuring whether that extra liquidity will actually be used on flop auctions?   Cyrus: Assuming that the accumulation portion that Marko showed us is hitting the flop auctions.   Mark: Can\u2019t say 100% certainty that this specific Dai was used for flops. But he\u2019s generally related to 3 different accounts that won some of the flop auctions.   WR: Also, thinking about the actual flow of generating the Dai to when it is used in the flop. Even if generating the liquidity might be read as 100% going into flop, then if we look into the data, it might be a smaller percentage entering flop auctions.   Mark: I will verify again, but these accounts are quite large. It\u2019s difficult to say this entity minted this Dai for one auction or for potential collateral auctions if ETH would continue to fall.   Cyrus: I was thinking we could wait for the flop auctions to end before we do a detailed analysis.   WR: Yeah, I was just mentioning a framework to think about it; to measure from the beginning from the introduction of USDC to the looking at the full queue; looking at the use case we expected and the results that were obtained. How much of that liquidity actually went into the expected result.   Cyrus: Agreed.     ",

Though the ETH prices have continued to fluctuate between 120 and 140, the peg has been holding relatively steady.   1681\u00d7832 81.1 KB   This is because there haven\u2019t been major fluctuations in the ETH/DAI supply in that time frame. After the March 12th to March 14th time frame, once the Dai supply went down to about 77 million and then, over the course of liquidations finishing out, it fell to about 68 million. It has held steady since then.   1545\u00d7656 194 KB    After that, over a similar time frame, the peg has not moved much.   After all of the craziness of black Thursday, the price went up to about $1.07 or even $1.10. On the weighted average, it was about $1.07, although some of those trades experienced crazy amounts of slippage in that time frame.   Some of the highest deviations happened on Uniswap, with a decent chunk continued on dYdX, where a lot of those trades were a $1.07 to $1.10 at their highest point. Uniswap saw crazy slippage in both directions.   After these insane spikes, the Dai price started to come down a bit. As Dai was being sourced for a large number of liquidations and auctions, after that, then it began to run up again a bit. A lot of that was happening on both dYdX with Oasis reclaiming a share of the trading volume, which had been lost to dYdX over the past couple of months. After holding steady for $1.07 for a few days, the price came back down to around $1.03/$1.0. Then, around 5-6 days ago came back down to around $1.03/$1.02, and has been fluctuating in this range over the last week or so.   Part of the reasoning for this is that there are still holdouts from auctions and uncertainty from people in terms of when the peg will come back down to $1.00. This likely leads to hesitancy from market makers and arbitragers to sell more Dai. The minting has also been down as the total supply has been pretty flat in the last week or so. In order to incentivize more minting of Dai, there has been a lot of conversation about stability fees, but I believe that it has more to do with the sentiment and arbitrage opportunity.    1628\u00d7808 87.4 KB   As was just talked about with USDC vaults, we can see that from inception, it grew quickly to about 6.7 million Dai on March 23rd. This has been holding pretty flat and has been used by a few large keepers who have been sourcing liquidity and getting ready for auctions.   1625\u00d7812 71.6 KB   More activity was seen in the last couple of days, which came back down today. This supply growth, as a target for incentivizing Dai being generation, is a conversation that we have been having by potentially lowering that USDC stability fee.   944\u00d7525 91.1 KB   The ETH<>DAI supply indicates that a low SF through ETH is not incentivizing people to mint more due to uncertainty around ETH\u2019s next moves. This causes a lot of traders and participants to be hesitant to want to mint that much more Dai and sell it.   1515\u00d7642 211 KB   In terms of when Dai will return to peg, I expect it may hover around $1.02 for a little longer. This may be a persistent effect until people become more comfortable leveraging on ETH again. There is obviously this thread around USDC, but that is not likely to be a huge source of Dai minting in the coming days in the current iteration. As Cyrus said if we offer a different option for how the USDC vault is structured that is more geared toward arbitrage, that may change. This may change with a dedicated collateral type for peg arbitrage.  Vishesh\u2019s connection dropped Restarts here at 1:16:05  927\u00d7303 75.4 KB   We went over what was going on with Dai price. In terms of USDC vaults, even though the net USDC activity has leveled out, the collateralization of some of those USDC vaults has increased since the launch. This is somewhat curious regarding why they have a little extra collateral. This isn\u2019t significant compared to the ETH vaults currently, so we should wait and see how USDC is being used.   922\u00d7285 48.8 KB   In terms of the ETH vaults, it is interesting to note that this liquidation wall had gone down to say 56$ mid-crisis. It has gone back up to about 69$ since. I think people are feeling a little more comfortable. That is despite the ETH price coming back up to about $130. Something to watch that people are doing their usual behavior, as price levels out, they also level out their amount of collateral relative to the debt. The debt amount has not moved significantly post-crisis in liquidation, so that\u2019s the primary collateral action that we are seeing. Just something to be aware of.  Primoz Migration Analysis 1:10:23  985\u00d7450 115 KB   The current Sai supply is at 14.1 million. It decreased by 1.4 million in the past week. This wasn\u2019t as heavy as a week ago during Black Thursday during the CDP rush for the exit. On the other hand, Sai in the migration contract did not fall as heavily, only about 0.5 million, because Sai is still migrating using migration to Dai.    Here you can see the flow over the past few weeks. About 100,000 Sai per day was deposited in the migration contract. The flow isn\u2019t as intense as the weeks before, but Sai is still migrating.   1377\u00d7404 130 KB    1.4 million net repayments. This is for the large CDP who repaid their debt fully. One very large CDP closed its debt. There were about 130,000 Dai in fees collected.   The remaining fees are at 1.5 million, with 1 million to be repaid by the largest CDP. 0.5 million is expected to be closed, while the largest  CDP has not shown any kind of activity within the last ten months.   The migration contract dropped by about 0.5 million. The current inventory is about 3.3 million Sai in the migration contract. From a CDP perspective, it is good that they now have one-quarter of the supply available in the migration contract. If they need to make a repayment, there is plenty of supply in percentage terms.     Largest CDP\u2019s that repaid their debts within the last week. This one paid about $90,000 in fees alone.   729\u00d7123 32.1 KB   Some CDP\u2019s are below 150% collateralized, not sure why it still has not gone to liquidation. The number of CDPs, 34, has lowered since two weeks ago, so the situation has improved.   693\u00d7245 47.2 KB    In terms of potential liquidation events and effects on the system, these are the potential debt liquidations depending on various ETH price changes by percentage.   With a 48% drop in ETH price, there would be a total SCD liquidation of 2-3 million, which is roughly equal to the amount of SCD in the migration contract.   Closing Thoughts   I wasn\u2019t expecting such a high degree of repayment, possibly because I thought that with a stable ETH price, why would CDP\u2019s rush for exits? It seems there is still some fear-induced tendency of another ETH drop. It is hard to say what happens next.   The important thing to note is that if there is a shutdown and Sai inventory needs to be drained, there needs to be this thing that we discussed the last time that we need to disable the one-way bridge from Sai to Dai because people are still migrating Sai.   Perhaps SCD debt ceiling reduction might also be good because we are still seeing Sai minting, which totally does not make sense because there is an upside liquidity. We do not want to see Sai minting, although that debt does not carry interest, so I\u2019m not sure.   Questions and Comments 6 1:20:19   Chao Pan: How does the system restrict or direct the usage of Dai even when you have risk parameters set for two types of USDC.   Cyrus: You can\u2019t really restrict them unless you have DC set to zero and then do an emergency executive to raise it. This is a lot of overhead, and perhaps one day in the future can be made easier with an instant access module. If you set the SF prohibitively high, that could also take care of it. Thus, a high SF would make it difficult to make money on Dai peg arbitrage and could effectively restrict it.   CP: So it can only go one way? Can you only set it higher to stop people from arbitraging? Is it not better to lower the current rate?   Cyrus: Presumably, the current one would go way lower, and than a different one would go higher. The issue is, right now, we have a hybrid strategy where the SF is in the middle, which is probably not desirable.   CP: that makes sense thank you.   LFW: Should we poll about this?   Cyrus: I think there are a lot of proactive decisions to make. Not just for the USDC but also for the circuit breaker itself. A holistic execution strategy is also important. There are all very active measures that governance needs to be involved with. Up to now, this community has been more passive governance type of ecosystem. That is a bit concerning, and I think we can do some work.   LFW: Do you mean we need a better definition of when we need to use these tools?   Cyrus: Answering the question of When, thresholds, and criteria for how things are executed. We want to make sure we know what we are doing and have a timeline for doing it if something happens.   LFW: That will depend on Maker holders.   Cyrus: Medium-high priority project.     1:23:50   Willaim Remor: Question for Vishesh, on Collateralization distribution for USDC, for that 150%+ bucket. Do you have any hypothesis as to why?   Vishesh: Yeah, I do. My sense is that there are people who have USDC right now waiting to potentially arbitrage or participate in liquidations. They\u2019re not actively maxing out their Dai withdrawing abilities right now, maybe preparing to act in the event of a profit opportunity.   WR: Therefore, potentially just having a cost of capital that they\u2019re willing to bear upfront.   Vishesh: Yeah, and the other thing is the ecosystem has slightly changed. Observing changes the observed. USDC in Maker now means a bit of a shift in how keepers, owners, and market makers think about their portfolios. USDC might become part of this cycle with ETH<>DAI<>USDC, whereas before, it was more just ETH<>DAI. Holding USDC at the right times in the right amounts becomes part of their workflow, given that USDC can now be used as a leverage point to create more Dai when there is an opportunity to arbitrage Dai.   WR: Makes sense.   MM: Adding to that, there are no liquidations that are going to be happening on USDC. You don\u2019t have to worry about what you deposit to mint Dai there. It\u2019s a different ecosystem. Going back to the S thing, I think that if this was a risk-on, people would have left their ETH deposited and would have minted Dai to go up to 70%. Instead, they drew ETH and let their liquidation ratio go up. I think that\u2019s a confidence event, not a risk-on event.   Vishesh: One other correlation and behavior to note; If you look at March 23-24, there was a bit more USDC<>Dai minted out, about 1 million more, after which it was paid back. What happened to the peg during that time was: post-crash the price hit $1.01 at the end of the 22nd. On the 23rd, it went up to $1.03, $1.04, on oasis at $1.07, and then after the 24th, it came down again. There is some relationship there between the hump of USDC<>Dai issued and reincrease in where Dai was traded at. That does start to track where the people with USDC balance were waiting for Dai to raise above peg to mint Dai and arbitrage it back down.   MM: I was one of those guys part of that million thing. That number sounds realistic based on the markets and pricing; it just did not have enough of an effect that the rest of the Dai did not go down to the peg. It went somewhere else.   Vishesh: This is where we can start to talk about how people were thinking about auctions, tracking the numbers to the behavior.   Mitakash: There are a bunch of ETH vault holders that lost capital in this downturn. Is there anyone thinking about maybe they lost confidence in Maker and hence are not opening new vaults? Perhaps that is why the Dai supply is not increasing?   MM: That\u2019s my take on this. More than 50% is a confidence issue. It\u2019s a real effect, and we can\u2019t ignore it.   Vishesh: I would agree with the reality of the effect. But if you consider the proportion of vaults with loss versus the total vaults, then it isn\u2019t the biggest chunk. There are things we know, things we don\u2019t know, and things that we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know. Sure, there are some degree of confidence that are less than 100% but greater than 0%. We can reasonably say that based on historic ETH price effects and how it impacts leveraging behavior, this is not new. Post large crash in ETH price, we\u2019ve seen less minting than in the past. It gets into subjective arguments and not quantitative data. We don\u2019t have the exact proportion of impacts. There are multiple variables, and there is no complete narrative.   LFW: We don\u2019t know how much to attribute to Maker versus ETH price surge.   MM: We do have some indicative data around price lags before the peg comes down. It wasn\u2019t clear in the debacle. But there is a lag effect, and it does seem important. Only so much Dai can be minted with the collateral in the system. I do agree that the confidence interval is between 0 and 100. The peg still follows the general market mechanics. We haven\u2019t had enough of a bull run to really push the peg down and have people to have freedom in their vaults to have the freedom to mint. I think they pulled out because they thought it was another event they get liquidated and lose it all.   Vishesh: I was purely talking about Dai minting. Faith in the peg is more difficult. Market events are the prime driver. Historically, the Dai peg has fluctuated with ETH instability. If you look at a 90-day time frame, the correlation between ETH price movement and Dai peg, the movement drops, but it\u2019s still a 55% Pearson correlation. In times of high volatility, it jumps to 80% negative correlation.   WR/MM: Agree.     01:34:10   MM: If you look at a curve of confidence, we\u2019re low right now. Vishesh, you\u2019re right that the market dominates this whole scene, but I don\u2019t want to underplay the confidence being low at an all-time low.   WR: Are we jumping to the conclusion too quickly in calling it confidence? Minting is one part, but we don\u2019t know the other metrics to portray confidence, for instance, the velocity of minting, or the recency of events.   Vishesh: An old analysis I did with ETH was looking at short-term and long-term averages. The idea being how \u201ccheap\u201d people think ETH is in the short term vs. in the long term. I think it has a strong relationship with Dai being minted and the Dai supply. My point is that you can\u2019t make it just about confidence. There\u2019s also ETH price impact.   MM: There is another component of confidence, confidence in the markets, in Maker, in ETH going through the floor. People don\u2019t want to take risks. It is a risk-off event.   Vishesh: It might be helpful to think about confidence in the protocol versus sentiment around ETH. I think ETH sentiment is the prime driver very often.   MM/WR: Yup, agreed.     1:37:15   Chao Pan: Confidence in borrowing USDC and peg arbitraging means that vault owners are 100% confident they don\u2019t get liquidated, but they don\u2019t push against the current percentage. Probably because of the high-interest rate. It will still take two weeks to have a rate below 10%. This means when after the first week, those that borrowed Dai two weeks ago might break even. It only takes one week if they lose money by being the first actors in arbitrage. That will be another upside pressure for Dai. My suggestion is: do we want to have a directional vote for USDC SF? We really don\u2019t want a higher one than current right? In the context of SCD shutdown, there is 10MM debt, which means the only way to pay back is buying Dai on the market or generating Dai using USDC, and it\u2019s all an upward push.   LFW: Regarding the point of initial arbitragers closing out when they break even. If that pushes the Dai price up again because SF is lower, you should see another wave of arbitragers come and push it back down.   Mitakash: Can you please explain this arbitrage mechanism?   LFW: I can try. Essentially, you have USDC locked into USDC vault. If Dai is trading above a dollar, you mint Dai with this USDC. Then you sell it for more than a dollar, for USDC, and then and you have more USDC than you have Dai. In the future, you are betting that Dai will continue to come down.   Mitakash: So it\u2019s not a complete arbitrage. If you sell that Dai and Dai doesn\u2019t come back down for you to buy at a lower price, it is not arbitrage. You\u2019re betting on market events.   Vishesh: This is one of the biggest hesitancy with engaging with USDC for arbitrage. You don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re stuck in your Dai position before the price comes back down. Which means you don\u2019t know how big your fee will be. At around 20%, it is not an inconsiderable number.   CP: Isn\u2019t it that the case for lower SF, so they can push the price down without accumulating significant interest? All of this is an expectation on Dai price. If people expect a premium to be there, they will still not act. Even with the SF down. No new market makers will come into what we call \u201carbitrage.\u201d   Vishesh: It is definitely possible to make that argument. The bigger point to overshadow this is: until ETH confidence returns, there will be a premium on Dai. Since Dai has proven that it\u2019s a useful asset in times of great volatility. In that, you can arbitrage it or take discounts on liquidations. Because it has these use cases and is able to make a passive yield. That asset becomes extraordinarily valuable as a result, possibly more than USD or USDC. That, combined with the fact that supply just took a huge haircut, maybe more so than demand. It may continue to trade at a premium until overall market sentiment changes.   LFW: I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that USDC is a permanent solution for the Dai peg and that people will have to sell back to Dai. The point is to spread out the liquidity crunch. So, ultimately the people who are using that are relying on ETH confidence and people opening more ETH<>DAI vaults.   Mitakash: To me, the least rational actors are the Dai holders in DSR. If you\u2019re expecting 3-4%, why not grab a 2% return right now. But no one is doing that.   MM: We don\u2019t know where the Dai is coming from. Since on secondaries, you can borrow and deposit back into the DSR. People are borrowing other assets and locking Dai into DSR. It\u2019s speculation but the only one that I can come up with.   MM: I agree with you that this whole USDC to mint Dai is not a true arbitrage event. An arbitrage event is to sell on Coinbase at $1.04 and buy from dYdX at $1.03. That happens simultaneously and is a real arb. What we\u2019re talking about is a Dai PUT. One-sixth of what\u2019s out there did the PUT, and maybe some arb, and then unwound it pretty quickly. Whereas 6 Million sits out waiting for auctions at 20%. As a person who might take on a Dai short, I would unravel that quickly. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s 20-30%. I\u2019m going to make money and do it fast. I don\u2019t like that those people are sitting on it, and I think going up on the SF would tap on those people to do anything, to be an active maintainer that does something in the system, and then observes a response. Then, we can make a call about whether to go down or further up to eliminate some of this behavior.   Mitakash: You\u2019re discounting one fact. The reason people minted or borrowed that Dai is to set up for the auctions. We didn\u2019t know when they would happen; governance takes its time. It could have happened Monday or Friday. It\u2019s probably still sitting waiting for auctions.   MM: Why would you sit on the fees, though? Wouldn\u2019t you want to use it quickly? I imagined this more like an emergency facility that people would go into and out of quickly.   Mik: I agree, but the reason they\u2019re using it for emergency still doesn\u2019t take into account that the timeline is all over the place. This could have happened last Saturday.

I am the head of Community Development, and in this context, I\u2019m the Interim Governance Facilitator. We have a really interesting call today; We have a special guest who I will introduce in a second. There will be a lot of questions and debate, looking forward to it.   If you have questions and access to a microphone don\u2019t be shy about speaking up. We have a highly intelligent group of people here. We need to hear from everyone. If you don\u2019t have access to a mic or are pretending to be working somewhere, type your questions in the side-bar. I\u2019ll keep an eye on that and will try to ask those for you.   Keep an eye on the disassociated chats, there\u2019s been this trend recently where we have multiple conversations happening. One in the call, and one in the chat.   Setting the context, I\u2019ll continue to mention the cycle of urgency, apathy, distraction, and denial. It\u2019s a meta-cycle that we go through in the ecosystem as a whole but also the Governance community as a microcosm of that same cycle/pattern of behavior.  What that looks like is: something happens and we need to furiously address that issue and it\u2019s all hand on deck. We\u2019re laser-focused on fixing that problem. Once the urgency passes, seven days later we start with the next thing. we frequently miss these dangling threads that we have lying around. Something bad just happened and we got through that thing, and now we\u2019re not talking about it anymore. It\u2019s kind of weird. An apathy phase can kick in. We start hitting distraction phases where we find a new emergency, new shiny object, or initiatives happening and we try to get through those and lose track of the past initiatives.    It may sound esoteric but I made a list! These are things we have been talking about over the last 2 months.   SCD shutdown   GSM delay   Dark fix   MKR token authority   0-bid response   DeFi consortium (led by RichCL)   USDC onboarding   Collateral onboarding as a major initiative   Flop and Flop auction tweaking   PR teams that are self-organizing, which is super healthy   Governance vote cadence   Voting types: Ranked-choice versus first-past-the-post voting   Vote Delegation   How do we handle Engagement     The list of threads goes on-and-on. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past; Governance requires operational overhead, particularly open-source-governance, like what we have here. Where the hierarchy is flat and people need to step up to the plate. We need to maintain initiative, momentum, agility, and at the same time, it\u2019s very complicated. It\u2019s my contention, and I try to avoid making judgments or conclusions in these calls, that we\u2019ve reached a cap on what cognitive, bureaucratic, and operational overhead that we can handle as a group with the methodology that we\u2019ve been using. We\u2019ve hit this stage where things drop off the radar. The question is how do we handle this world we live in that\u2019s for more complex than the one we lived in just 16 months ago. How do we move forward and maintain momentum?   Here\u2019s the segue(pronounced segway): Rune and Charles have been working on this issue for a while; giving it deep thought, and have a plan for us. Rune will articulate this plan today, how this ecosystem and group can handle some of the overhead. Some of the thread gathering that needs to be done. How we can collaborate on moving forward and tackling the fantastic amount of work for us.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   The Self-Sustaining MakerDAO Initiative Rune Christensen 08:02  Opener slide1026\u00d7534 69.9 KB    This slideshow has been used internally in the Foundation, aligning for the next steps. We\u2019ve launched MCD. Delivering the big piece of technology that the foundation existed to deliver. What is the next step after that? What is the final phase of the Foundation? The answer is to make MakerDAO self-sustainable and governance fully empowered to the point where the Foundation can disappear entirely, and ultimately Maker can reach its full potential as a decentralized project.   I\u2019m going to go through the slides, but my idea is to make this as a discussion rather than a solo presentation. I expect every single slide to have points that people will be interested in, so potentially there will be questions and discussion. Hopefully Rich and Charles can also chime in with stuff. We should also make sure to move the conversation along; there is something like 7 or 8 slides in total and we have to make sure we get through the whole thing and we don\u2019t rabbit-hole on just one topic.   Overall, this is a very brief, general, high-level overview of all the different pieces that are going to come together in order to spell out the future of the project, from the perspective of the Foundation.   The standing point is: the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation(Full legal name of the Maker Foundation) fundamentally exists to bootstrap the DAO. It was born to create the technology and then to empower the community to become increasingly decentralized over time and ultimately take over control completely. This was actually spelled out in the Foundation proposal, which at this point is probably ancient history that most people don\u2019t know about. The concept was ratified in the community that the Foundation would start off as having a lot of responsibility in the community and ecosystem, but gradually will step back, decentralizing the project further and further.   10:22  MEGF plans to dissolve1018\u00d7572 99.6 KB    With MCD delivered, it is time to accelerate the decentralization. We can really see the final step, the last mile, from the community running a lot of things, to the point where there\u2019s no need for the Foundation because the community can handle everything on its own, which is what we call: Self-Sustaining MakerDAO.  For that, we need a new generation of core governance contributors, of technical contributors, of people being more empowered with resources and tools to deal with this new world of self-sustaining Dai. And the point that is important to make is that the Foundation does have a finite runway.    It has a lot of capital because it distributed all of the MKR, but at some point, that is meant to run out. The strategy has been that the Foundation takes a lot of action, does a lot of stuff, has a lot of employees, ultimately because we want to very quickly get to the point where the community is fully empowered.   This is a starting point. Of course, the Foundation is not dissolving anytime soon. There are several years left where the Foundation will be operating at full steam. And then from there this process of dissolution will begin. It\u2019s important that we already, now, in the community, begin preparing governance to take over the system.   Questions and Comments 1 13:25   Richard Brown: I can try and seed some discussion; I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t know the answer to this question. Is there a timeline in mind for this gradual decentralization?  Rune: It\u2019s very important to note that the rollout of this self-sustaining MakerDAO initiative is going to be a step-by-step process with an emphasis on safety. We shouldn\u2019t jump off of a cliff taking drastic action without understanding the consequences. The timeline can\u2019t be fixed in stone; generally, the idea is about 2 years from now the Foundation will begin the dissolution process and the dissolution will be gradual. The process will be taken slowly and in-hand with the community.    14:44   chat Akiva(read by Richard Brown): In relation to the 3rd point; Is the Foundation\u2019s revenue included in calculating the runway?  Rune: Great point. This speaks about the broad plan for what the dissolution looks like. Without going into the details, the Foundation is preparing a transparency report with much greater insight. This would give the community resources and materials giving a much greater insight into what is going on within the Foundation, what are the different teams and functions and so on. The different assets that the Foundation controls. The Foundation has a lot of assets. One example is Oasis, which is a very popular DeFi front-end. The plan of the dissolution is that some of these assets can actually become self-sustaining in their own right. They don\u2019t have to be attached. Oasis could become its own self-sustaining DeFi project. The Foundation team will not go away and leave the community. The team will change and be in a different form. Hopefully, as many people as possible and as many assets as possible will be regular members of the community, like everyone else and continue contributing without any official status.    Continued Presentation 17:04  1312\u00d7744 72.5 KB   Core pillars1309\u00d7736 125 KB    Now I will get into the details of what self-sustaining MakerDAO actually means.   We have defined three core pillars. The goal is to achieve long-run governance. A state where the community is able to run all aspects of the protocol, covering all risks, take advantage of all the opportunities, manage every single dynamic of the protocol for the long-run. With no gaps, nothing where there\u2019s some sort of reliance on a central party or the Foundation or some external parties. To achieve this, to build this concretely, there are these three pillars that the Foundation considers very important. These are not new concepts, they are all continuations of formalizations of what\u2019s organically emerged in the community already.   The first is the Elected Paid Contributors(EPC) and Domain Teams.  We already have several domain teams: Risk Teams, the Governance Facilitator, an Oracles Team. All of these teams operate in a somewhat formal environment and have been empowered by the community. This has to be developed further. The crucial element of compensation by the Maker Protocol needs to be added to it so that governance has full autonomous control over these resources in the long run.    The second is Maker Improvement Proposals; these were introduced by Charles in the forums yesterday.  The Foundation will make a series of MIP\u2019s to bootstrap this entire concept. The goal is to formalize a structure that is already happening organically in the community. We see in the forums, with signal request polls, where this decision-making begins in the ideation-conception stage, and then becomes a more formal proposal and ultimately goes to vote. MIPs are a way to completely formalize and structure this concept and then make the process entirely transparent end-to-end, so there\u2019s no black box. It\u2019s to really spell everything out in order to maximize access for everyone and make it very accessible and easy for voters to consider and see the whole process end-to-end.    Finally, we have vote delegates. People or entities that are assigned MKR votes by MKR holders.   The Foundation believes that vote delegation is incredibly important to overhaul the way voting currently works. To move it away from being mainly dominated by a few whales/large MKR holders.   Additionally, sometimes it\u2019s not easy to understand why exactly they\u2019re voting in the way they are. This pillar will help us enter a new paradigm where public delegates somehow interface directly with the community and are directly accountable for how they vote and provide a better connection between the discussion happening in the community and the outcomes from the voting on-chain.     These three pillars need to be wrapped-up and implemented in what\u2019s called a Governance Paradigm. This is a technical term, a complete set of processes that covers these things and a complete team of elected paid contributors and domain teams that can actually carry out the work that needs to be done within these processes. As well as a healthy ecosystem of voting and decision making with delegates that have good relationships and good communication with the community and can actually react with the emerging will of the governance community. I\u2019ll go in-depth on all of these things but want to see if any questions have popped up.   Questions and Comments 2 22:49   Mitote: Long term, what do you think of domain teams having voting rights?   Rune: This is one of the things that need to be put up for debate. MIPs will allow us as a community together to clarify and figure out how we want these rules and concepts to be decided by the community. From my perspective, I think that the domain teams, well I like to make the analogy to politics and governments. I see Elected Paid Contributors and Domain Teams, where people such as risk teams, and smart contracts developers are paid by the protocol to make it sustainable, and they are like public servants.   They are similar to people who work in the government, for the government, and running the different ministries and executing all the different operations that a government needs to do. On the other hand, you have the vote delegates, who are like the politicians, they make the big decisions. When the course of action isn\u2019t totally clear, it is up to MKR voters to make the decision.   The domain teams are more about implementation rather than them being the political actors that are meant to push particular opinions in the community. The community as a whole needs to discuss that, and start defining the Maker Improvement Proposals to define these proposals and figure out the pros and cons.     25:29   lastmjs: How will the payments work legally? If I\u2019m a contractor that needs to be paid by this nebulous organization, what kind of documents will I need?   Rune: Great question. There\u2019s no answer to it right now. There is an internal working group within the Foundation, being led by our HR function that is focused on coming up with some ideas for how the community will decide to actually structure this. One idea that\u2019s been floating around a lot, that I\u2019m a fan of, is the idea that the DAO may want to have a decentralized network of legal entities. Potentially having a lot of foundations around the world that are able to be funded directly from the protocol.   You can use those as a kind of intermediary. All of that is speculation at this point though, and the foundation will work diligently on some real analysis to figure out what are some good options for this. Ultimately, it also comes down to what the community wants. There\u2019s a tradeoff. You may want to go in one direction, putting the protocol toward paying out the money through the code and letting the recipients figure it out. Or the community can go the other way: the DAO will take care as much as possible and make it as easy as possible to be a contributor in order to attract more contributors. And the Foundation will try to come up with some data points on this with as many insights as possible to help make the right decision and ultimately propose a structure.     Continued Presentation 28:08  Long run governance1313\u00d7734 207 KB    Rune: Why is it so important to get started now? The number one priority should be that when the Foundation starts dissolving, it should not have a negative impact on the performance of the project.   The community should be fully set up to handle everything, to cover all risks, and take advantage of all opportunities. And really, the dissolution of the Foundation should be an inflection point that sees the project improve significantly. It should not be a set back where we aren\u2019t quite ready and then the community goes into a tailspin and has to react and figure out how to deal with that now that not all the bases aren\u2019t covered. The community needs to have the ability to do long-run governance in advance so the transition of the dissolution of the Foundation can be as smooth as possible.   For this, we will need governance processes that are well-defined and formalized; that\u2019s the MIP process. That by itself is not enough. We need practical tools. The community needs to already have this experience of governing the system through formalized processes. It\u2019s not like from one day to the other suddenly we have these processes and we need to figure out what to do with them. Instead, when the Foundation starts dissolving, no one should notice because we\u2019re already operating through this paradigm. It should be this gradual step-by-step replacement of the Foundation responsibilities with formalized processes in the community.   Of course, we also need to significantly improve the state of the whole ecosystem. Both, from the Foundation and also from the community. The technology needs to be more polished, so we don\u2019t have unexpected behavior happening. Everything needs to documented. We need to have a completely different rigor when it comes to documentation because nothing can be left as oral history. Everything has to be written down and clearly available as documentation. And then we need to do knowledge-sharing from contributors within the Foundation to this new generation of elected contributors that are going to work directly for the Protocol.   This is crucial, especially for technical security. If you don\u2019t have a knowledge share of skillset and knowledge to the new generation of contributors, it might reach a point where it would be unsafe to leave the protocol running. If we lose the skills to autonomously keep the Protocol safe, that would not be a very good situation to be in. Because it\u2019s so complex and there is so much unique knowledge required to create secure smart contracts. Ultimately, this is an exercise in doing things practically. The theory around this is great but the only way that we can know whether we\u2019re in the right place is by having practical experience and by having done things and having run through all of these concepts for real, rather than just thinking about them.     Questions and Comments 3 32:38   AndyT: I think this is amazing, as most of the people do on this call. And I agree with you. I think it is about providing the tools in order for people to generate a new generation of both governance and technical contributors. It\u2019s a minor point, but I think it\u2019s long-term important; In terms of the language that we use to describe this, you can see it in this slide, and I know that this is a deck that was being used internally at the Foundation, there is still a distinction, at a linguistic level, between us and them(the Foundation and the community). The metaphor you would rather go with is the glass of sugar water.   The Foundation is syntactic sugar that makes stuff work at the moment, but ultimately the dissolution of the Foundation is precisely that it merges into the community so that this barrier between us and them is something that just falls away. The linguistic barrier between us and them, even though we\u2019re big on talking about the community, there still remains a big difference between core contributors and them(the community, which they serve.) So it\u2019s interesting in this kind of discussion to be careful about this distinction. It\u2019s only when speaking about the community and the Foundation as one thing that that begins to filter into people\u2019s experience.   Rune: I totally agree with your points. I can\u2019t see right now exactly where you\u2019re referring to, but I can imagine that it might have slipped through. That certainly isn\u2019t the intention. From my perspective, those of us who work for the Foundation, we have to make this distinction really clear: that\u2019s important for a lot of reasons. When you think about how the Foundation does a lot of external interactions with regulators and with media, we have to make this distinction clear. I think everyone in the foundation thinks \u2018\u2018we\u2019re just members of the community like everyone else.\u2019\u2019 I hope that\u2019s clear to everyone. We will definitely be the first ones to try to work things that way. I\u2019m surprised that it came out like this in this slide. I\u2019m looking for somewhere defining \u2018\u2018us and them\u2019\u2019 I want to go and edit it right now, but I can\u2019t see it.   Rich Brown: I kind of see that point, I know what the underlying question is. We have this fine line in the Foundation where we need to always remain cognizant that we\u2019re a community-driven organization. It\u2019s the will of the holders and people in the forums that these externalities are what are driving decision making and the vision and long-term success of the organization. We also need to be cognizant about having an outsized impact on the decision-making process and make sure there\u2019s a clear delineation between the will of the Foundation and the will of the people. Balancing all these dichotomies can very tricky sometimes, and trying to bring those back together at the end once the Foundation dissolves and once we act as, sort of, spores that go into the community and begin seeding the ecosystem from the community. It\u2019s a weird distinction to make. Something will keep in mind. It\u2019s a good point.   Rune: I completely agree with the points made. That\u2019s important feedback, that in the Foundation we will try to use the language correctly because that matters a lot of what the ultimate outcome is and the behavior that we will see in the community, so I think that\u2019s a good point.   Andy: Forgive me for being a grammar Nazi, I really just wanted to mention the concept of sugar water because it\u2019s going to be very very sweet when the Foundation dissolves.   Link from cryptowanderer on language     Continued Presentation 38:24  Elected Paid Contributors1300\u00d7740 225 KB    Rune: Let\u2019s get into the meat of what we\u2019ve basically already talked about quite a bit. This slide is about the first pillar of self-sustaining long-run Governance.   Technical security and technical maintenance of the Protocol is the number one thing, a real pressing issue. When you think about it in the long-run, it\u2019s just so incredibly critical that Maker governance has complete access to all the resources it needs in order to make sure that it can by itself guarantee the security of the Protocol. It would be totally disastrous if Maker governance had to rely on a single entity to keep the technology safe. Like the sword of Damocles. This is a critical reason why we need to get started with EPC and Domain Teams as soon as possible. So we can begin this knowledge share and begin reducing this single point of concentration of technical knowledge within the Foundation. And then there are risk teams. We know that quite well because that is a concept that has existed in the community for years at this point.   The technical side and the collateral onboarding side are the bread and butter of EPC and domain teams; the two basic things that are necessary so that the Protocol remains secure, and so that the community can autonomously scale exponentially without again relying on something like the Foundation.   EPC is a term used to describe the dynamics of the protocol governance electing and then paying individual contributors through the governance process, who then can operate in what would be a completely unique way of working. It will be this radically transparent and horizontal organization that will work in collaboration with the community on the forum and in the chat. I believe near-complete transparency around all kinds of work that they do. We won\u2019t be able to have full transparency for everything, for example, if a bug is found, there has to be some kind of response. You can\u2019t have literally 100% transparency, but I think it will be possible to achieve 99% transparency, which will be a very big change from right now as the Foundation needs to be really careful with the information that it shares.   Domain teams is a concept of organizing teams of domain specialists: a team or individual that has been recognized by governance as a specialist within a particular field and given special authority over a particular process. A good example is the Risk team having this special authority to propose risk constructs and all the risk parameters for collateral onboarding so that the community and the MKR holders can be certain that when there\u2019s a vote for some particular collateral type, it has gone through a sanity check by people who are known to be experts in those questions, and it\u2019s not a completely random proposal with no sanity checks whatsoever. There\u2019s a lot of overlap between EPCs and Domain teams.   To recap: EPC\u2019s are someone paid by the protocol, not necessarily given special access in a process. The community might decide to have an EPC that publishes research into a mechanism design and doesn\u2019t directly interact with the Protocol, like with governance on a day-to-day basis. They simply have a job that they do day-to-day. Domain teams, on the other hand, is like giving someone security clearance in a sense. The Risk team, for instance, isn\u2019t actually paid by the Protocol. But it has been given this security clearance, providing data and the ability to elect collateral that has been signed off by then. And, of course, you want to have a diversified team in the long run, of EPCs and domain teams, so we can spread the risk across many people.     Finally, the last thing to consider, even though technology, technical security, and the risk management and growth of the Protocol are the bread and butter of what governance absolutely need EPCs and domain teams for. There\u2019s also a lot of other really important operations that the Foundation is currently doing that potentially the community needs to consider that needs to be done through these tools. That could be, for example, decentralized marketing. Amazingly there\u2019s already a proposal in the community right now related to this, which I think is really cool. But maybe HR, to deal with the EPCs and the domain teams. Or legal teams to deal with things like real-world assets being included as collateral and so on. That\u2019s something that the community will need to consider and make decisions on as we start debating the implementation through Maker Improvement Proposals.   ",

It\u2019s going to be a very important tool for the community to use. As we all know, Maker even today there are so many complex processes happening today, and that will increase significantly in the future when we will have a lot more collateral, domain teams, and EPCs everywhere doing a lot of different things. E.g., when we have synthetic assets, so there\u2019s more than one peg to manage. All of these new concepts mean there are a lot of complicated processes and they need to be very clear on how they work. So there\u2019s no ambiguity and confusion as this will very quickly become a big risk as the system increases in complexity. It\u2019s also important to increase accessibility, so everyone knows how to participate in a process or in creating or changing processes.   MIPs will need clear language. Even as you will see with the MIPs that the Foundation will come out and release on Monday, the goal is to have no jargon, but go in the opposite direction: try to have the processes documented in a way that tries to be as user-friendly as possible so we can be as inclusive as possible.   Maker Improvement Proposals are going to be incredibly important in the short-run because that is how we and the community agree on what will we put in place and how we will implement it so that the Foundation can safely begin dissolving.   This concept of the community having a complete overview of all the processes that it needs fully in place so that all bases are covered and all aspects of the Protocol are running as it should with enough oversight and risk management; That\u2019s what the Foundation came to call the \u2018\u2018Governance Paradigm.\u2019\u2019 A complete solution to governance.   MIPs are going to be critical in that over time, the Governance Paradigm that the community implements in, let\u2019s say, a year from now, it\u2019s going to work. It will be good enough to actually run Governance, but it won\u2019t be good enough for the next 100 years. It needs to be able to adapt over time and evolve. Based on what we learn, such as the incident of the 12th of March when unexpected things happened and suddenly became clear that lots of things needed to be done by the community. As these events happen the community can use MIPs to, over time, iterate on the Governance Paradigm so it corresponds to the environment and what\u2019s needed from MakerDAO to perform optimally.   The MIPs framework is similar to other improvement proposal processes, like Ethereum Improvement Proposals, for example, but is different in an important way. Most other Improvement Frameworks are very technical in nature, they\u2019re for technical projects. That element is also apparent for Maker Improvement Proposals. But the core of what MIPs are about is governance. So it\u2019s really about defining the social layer, as much as it\u2019s about implementing technical changes to the Protocol.     51:36   Charles St. Louis: Before anyone asks any questions, I want to briefly give a summary of how all these work together.   In general, I like to think that the framework enables the community to continue to continuously affect changes and maintain the Maker Protocol in a standardized manner.   The MIPs themselves are the process to affect that change.   The EPCs are the people that both facilitate the MIPs process as well as create and propose that change.   The domain teams are a subset of the EPCs that are given special authority through governance to oversee the critical processes, mitigate any risks, and propose new developments to improve the Protocol overall.     Rune: I will give some examples: The collateral onboarding process implemented in MIPs. The MIPs will be how the community decides on what the process should look like. Then the Domain teams are a part of that process, they are being trusted by the community to provide the risk constructs.  The community still has complete control: it decides whether to accept or reject the risk construct. The important thing is that when the community is presented with the risk construct, there is this element of certainty that this comes from the domain team that has been authorized to do this kind of stuff. The process as a whole works to promote that the right collateral onboarding proposals, the right risk parameters, and so on are being set in the first place. So that we don\u2019t see a process that can easily be abused, but rather there is intelligence implementation that has checks and balances, considerations about things. Things like bandwidth becoming overwhelmed by noise, etc. all these types of risks that need to be considered in a completely decentralized process by governance.    Questions and Comments 4 54:17   Andy: For Rune or Charles, if these MIPs are based basically on EIPs, there are a number of teams that have some of the things 0x, Aragon and a number of others have done. I wonder if you have any thoughts about how Maker differs specifically or has improved upon other teams implementations of this. In particular, one of the problems with EIPs is potential politicization. I wonder if you thought about whether these will be political in any fashion, how to distinguish between technical and political contributions, whether you want to, and how this relates to other team\u2019s implementation of EIPs.   Rune: I\u2019ll let Charles talk. He\u2019s the expert.   Charles St. Charles: My general understanding, EIPs are purely based on technical implementation, and most or all of the other protocols, like BIPs or what they were originally based on PEPs (python enhancement proposals). They are all very technical based. The Python one kind of incorporates some process in terms of organization instructions, not necessarily on the political side. There are not many implementations out there that actually include the governance side of things or proposing these standardized processes. The main differentiator that we\u2019re mentioning on this slide at the bottom, we do incorporate the technical side of things, but the main focus is based on using these proposals to standardize governance processes for X amount of time until they can get swapped or improved upon over time.   In terms of EPCs or similar concepts of those, most of the DAOs that are currently operating have used the proposal/grant process and they haven\u2019t worked on any implementations where your hiring team or individual contributors or groups of contributors, for a time-based period or mandate type thing. That\u2019s also a differentiator that Maker will try to implement. Those are the two things that come to mind now. I have to think about it more, to be honest.   Rune: My comment is that anything can turn into politics. If Maker becomes a huge project that ends up being a significant force in global funding or something like that, it\u2019s unavoidable that there will be a lot of politics, and there will be a lot of what I call political proxy wars. You will have public characters fighting against each other over some trivial question, yet they still fight each other about it. It\u2019s about fighting for influence; it\u2019s about the characters trying to win over each other to gain more influence in the future. That\u2019s the kind of dynamics that are always going to happen.   The hope is that the processes that we put in place are resilient enough to be able to deal with that non-optimal behavior. Ultimately, the MKR holders are the final back-stop. That\u2019s really what ends up deciding everything. But even then there are checks and balances of that as well. I think that if the community is really good at bootstrapping the political climate, and the entire process of the entire environment of decentralized governance, it will naturally push people towards being constructive and seeking consensus and less towards these polarizing characters.   But it\u2019s always going to exist. In the EIPs, the governance aspect was not considered from the beginning. It became an issue later in time. With Maker, it\u2019s completely different. The Maker community has been about governance, as the defining concept from the very moment that the project began. I do expect that both the processes that we put in place and also the people that we put in place, will be in a much better place to handle the eventual political conflict and issues that will arise.     Continued Presentation 1:00:04  Vote Delegates1312\u00d7735 185 KB    The third pillar. I have this little meme about the three pillars: I like to say we have EPCs & Domain Teams, the MIPs, and the Vote Delegates; We\u2019re covering the people (EPCs), the process (MIPs), and the politics (Vote Delegates).   As we\u2019re talking about \u2018\u2018politics,\u2019\u2019 it\u2019s a part of what\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s this decision-making process and this actual process of swaying opinion, making opposing arguments, and ultimately having to decide in one of them; this is where having vote delegates is absolutely crucial. In the Foundation, we believe it\u2019s crucial because:   Delegates are individuals that can vote on behalf of other MKR holders. The very basic advantage that this has, is that it allows smaller MKR holders, who actually have a lot of MKR and are the biggest voting block, to pool together their votes. That\u2019s what delegation is going to enable. I believe that it will create a way for small holders of MKR to still feel like they\u2019re more included in the process and can have an impact empowering the delegates that they agree with. It will also make it easier for people as it becomes more akin to traditional politics. You don\u2019t have to have to actually know anything about complicated risk theory or something like that. You just need to be able to decide which delegate you agree with, which people do you believe are the right people to vote on your behalf. And of course, you can still always participate directly, if that\u2019s what you want to do. So it\u2019s all about giving more options to people.   Beyond being great for small MKR holders to be able to pool their votes and have a bigger impact on governance, it\u2019s also going to generally increase voter turnout even for large MRK holders, even institutional MKR holders. This is something that we have learned at the Foundation over the years: for those who have very large amounts of MKR, one doesn\u2019t really want to be using those private keys that often. It feels quite risky using private keys of MKR that\u2019s worth millions of dollars. If you can change that process, that experience, (instead of doing it again and again) you only will have to do it once. Then you don\u2019t do anything else unless you see the delegate behaving against what you wanted. But if things are going normal, the fact that you only need to set the delegation once, and then sit back and just watch, it\u2019s going to make a lot of people that right now don\u2019t vote, even with significant amounts of MKR, to begin participating using delegation. So that\u2019s really going to have a great impact, I think.   Also a point I want to make that\u2019s not on the slide: the way delegation can be used is if you\u2019re a big holder with a lot MKR, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that then that\u2019s going to create super-delegates, with tons of MKR that they can vote with, so something even more concentrated than the whales in the current system. It\u2019s for everyone\u2019s benefit to have a diverse political ecosystem with a lot of different voices and a lot of different decision-makers. So you can diversify your vote across multiple delegates, for instance, and that\u2019s going to be a way to create a very vibrant ecosystem of delegates.   The other really big advantage and the big change that vote delegates entering the space will achieve: it will create this connection between the voting behavior and the public discussion that\u2019s happening. Governance will get to a healthier point where decisions that are made on-chain for voting represent the arguments and the consensus that\u2019s happening in the forum and the chat, for instance. Anyone can be a delegate. It\u2019s possible today to do delegation. It\u2019s inherently permission-less. It doesn\u2019t require something like a governance decision to actually enable it. But it will be very important that the governance community still defines some sort of standardized guidelines around vote delegation through MIPs because that is what will encourage people to start participating in this ecosystem. It\u2019s also a critical piece of the three pillars. It will be a check and balance on the EPCs and the key to fully harness the potential of MIPs, by creating new processes and amending current processes, and basically reacting to how it all plays out.     01:06:47  1313\u00d7740 210 KB    I was talking about this concept of \u2018\u2018Governance Paradigm\u2019\u2019 earlier. It\u2019s a technical term that refers to a complete group of MIPs that cover every single risk, opportunity, and operational concept that the community needs to have fully formalized processes for; as well as a complete team of EPCs that can fully interact with these processes; and a fully healthy politically ecosystem of delegates, voters, of voter participation, whereas many people as possible feel included in the process. Ultimately, this can facilitate that the Protocol remains secure and can respond to emergent threats. With best practices when it comes to technical security and to handle scalable growth over time without the need for the Foundation or any third party. The Foundation is, right now, at the place where there\u2019s the most knowledge around what are all these risks and opportunities and all these different bases that need to be covered. The Foundation will draft and propose initial MIPs for all aspects of what in the Foundation we consider to be needed to achieve the first complete Governance Paradigm.  Ultimately it will be up to the community to decide. With input and will need the community to vote on them, and there will be even processes for the community to propose their own MIPs and alternative MIPs to what the Foundation is proposing. That is going to be critical. It needs to be a completely open process. Ultimately the Foundation plans to be able to draft a proposal by itself with everything necessary to put a complete Governance Paradigm in place. Everything needs to be covered. This is important for the Foundation because then the Foundation can ensure that is safe to follow the timeline and road map for the dissolution without impacting the safety of the project. And then the Foundation hopes it will be the core community members, the people on this call, for instance, and those who decide to become delegates, who spearhead actually using and understanding and controlling the power of the MIPs. Ultimately, the experience will start accumulating and can be then spread further and governance can, over time, be open more and more for greater levels of participation.    1:10:24  Get to Safety First1309\u00d7735 218 KB    This slide is talking about the timing of all of this. I feel there\u2019s a lot of content, and those watching may feel it\u2019s moving really fast. So much complexity, so many moving parts. Basically, from the Foundation\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s about safety, about risk management. Right now, objectively, there are no formalized processes in place and no contributors paid by the Protocol that would make it safe for the Foundation to dissolve right? What if everyone from the Foundation got on the same bus and there was an accident or something? The so-called \u2018\u2018bus factor.\u2019\u2019   There\u2019s a lot of risk in the Foundation being critical for the ecosystem. It\u2019s not just that processes or tools aren\u2019t in place. The community needs a lot of experience using these tools before it will be safe for them to be the final line of defense for everyone else. It\u2019s important to not let \u2018\u2018perfect be the enemy of the good\u2019\u2019 while we put these tools in place. While what the Foundation is proposing won\u2019t be perfect, it will be possible to use it, initially, as a first attempt at putting a complete Governance Paradigm in place and trying it out in practice.   And then, from this initial Governance Paradigm, the good-enough one, the community can then, with full independence, with no constraints or deadlines or time issues, rewrite these tools with a practical sense of knowing what it is to work with them, based on practical experience.   The Foundation is pushing ahead already now with rolling out the first MIPs and moving forward and trying to get some initial steps taken towards this as soon as possible so we can start building this practical experience, taking it step-by-step. By the time the dissolution happens, the tools and processes will be so built out that no one will care because it will be irrelevant.   So that\u2019s it. Apologies for going 20 minutes overtime. I see we lost some people on the way but that\u2019s not unexpected, as we went overtime. Any last questions or comments?     Charles St. Louis: If there are people that would like to ask question later I will put the MIPs chat for rocketChat here.   link for chat Questions and Comments 5 01:14:43   Rich: Thanks, Rune! A tremendous amount of information to absorb. Is that deck going to be posted?   Rune: Good point. I think we will release these slides. We do also have a blog post and a forum post. The Foundation will release that tomorrow that will basically rehash this presentation. But there\u2019s no reason not to make them public.   Rich: Sounds great. Thanks, everyone for joining. As always, these calls are for the dissemination of information, to initiate debates, to further signals, but the actual work of governance happens in the Forums. Give this some thought and then join us at forum.makerdao.com to join in the actual process, these things that Rune gave us a tour of. Thanks a lot that was amazing.     1:16:14   Lucas Vogelsang: I\u2019m curious if you have some MIPs that you\u2019re going to be prototyping this process with, or is the Foundation going to be pushing them?   Rune: Yes. Sorry for not making this more clear. First of all, this is something that has been underway for a long time. It\u2019s really well-timed, given the recent crash and the new surge of activity in governance. It\u2019s now very applicable. The core problem that the Foundation wanted to tackle, ultimately creating the MIPs concept, was collateral onboarding. This is a process that needs to be in place sooner rather than later so that the Community can use MCD as intended.   Rune: The foundation will release 13 MIPs divided into two MIPs sets; two sets that cover two distinct problems. The first will be the core Governance framework, the process to submit MIPs, and the monthly Governance cycles. A process for running Governance that has a greater level of throughput but also a greater level of checks and balances. More time to make sure that you\u2019re voting the right way. The second set is the collateral onboarding set. Some of you may be aware of a community created onboarding document. It\u2019s great especially since it was established by the community. We\u2019ve taken that and turned it into a MIP. In order to simplify the ratification by the community for their own process they established. This is a process that needs to be in place sooner rather than later so that the community can benefit from MCD the way it was intended. Both of those things will be released on Monday.     Lucas Vogelsang: I was going to ask about that collateral onboarding that got published and got so little attention because of everything else that happened. Glad to hear that will happen and look forward to it.   01:19:56   Charles St. Louis: Tomorrow we\u2019ll post in the forum as a follow up for this call detailing the Foundation\u2019s vision. On Monday we\u2019re going to post the MIPs we\u2019ve created to the forum and GitHub so people can look at them.   Rune: The ratification process and the timeline (for the decision-making process around the MIPs frameworks and feedback) everything that will be critical, will also be detailed tomorrow.   Rich: It seems like the questions may be trailing off. A reminder that this is the very first step in the long and complex road to implementation. Decentralization is not a simple thing, so we\u2019re once again at the forefront of this brave new world of DeFi, open-source governance, emergent process, and all the rest of it. Please contribute in the forums, help refine and get engaged with the process. As much as you possibly can. At this point, we have 4 minutes left of our regular schedule, I don\u2019t know if you, Cyrus, have something to say about Risk.  Cyrus; Not on my end, just state of the pegs(Vishesh\u2019s analysis.)    Analysis Vishesh The State of the Pegs 1:22:43  Dai Peg1909\u00d7617 159 KB   Dai is above peg. Kind of expected due to extreme illiquidity, and ETH<>DAi supply taking a huge hit.   1374\u00d7622 90.8 KB    The amount of Dai from ETH has not really recovered. It\u2019s come up $8 or 9 Million.  They\u2019re aware they can get a passive yield supplying elsewhere. In the event something wonky happens with ETH again one can probably make an arbitrage profit.   For those reasons, and potential uncertainty in how quickly this would come back to a dollar. A lot of people are hesitant to sell Dai right now.    Dai Peg1909\u00d7617 159 KB    I think that\u2019s pretty natural due to shell shock around Dai that just happened. It would be foolish to expect it to immediately return to a dollar. Naturally, the air needs to be let out of this a bit and people need to feel comfortable with ETH so they can mint more Dai. When that confidence returns in the market you\u2019ll see the price of Dai come back down. As I mentioned during all this craziness, this graph snaps into a negative correlation when ETH is doing poorly and hasn\u2019t snapped out of that yet.   There was a slight bump on the 28th when ETH was doing better. The scale is smaller than the y-axis ranges we looked at two weeks ago. That small hump led into a small bump in what was going on with Dai.   It\u2019s still locked into that inverse pattern. Which tells me the peg is not yet ready to let go of its correlation to ETH. When that decoupling happens, which I\u2019m reasonably confident it will at some point, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see it return to a Dollar. We\u2019re not quite there yet and you can\u2019t rush that return to peg. It would be difficult.    1263\u00d7317 68.9 KB   ETH Dai positions more dramatically centered back into that 300% CR bucket. A lot of folks see this as a sweet spot.   1413\u00d7374 50.1 KB   Maybe there was a \u2018\u2018memeization\u2019\u2019 of that $60-70 ETH price point for liquidations. People may have gravitated towards that price point.   1429\u00d7654 48.3 KB   As far as USDC after March 12th, USDC-Dai saw a huge increase and then dropped in utilization over the last few days. We\u2019ll see how that bucket evolves over time, given that it was an emergency measure.   Sai supply came down961\u00d7254 37.7 KB   Sai supply went down to approximately $14 Million.

Discussion about how to do the poll We have never tried to poll for priority, so some consideration about how to do this is needed. We are seeking consensus from the community through the thread above. There is a poll that will determine how we format the poll. This is an example of an emergent process that we as a group are trying to figure out. The new poll will go live on August 12th. Before this happens the new version of the portal will be out. Chis will join us in the call next week to talk about the changes.   Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   David: Forum Activity Recap 07:41  I will not cover all the threads, only new ones that\u2019s have been added this week. For a recap of older threads you can look at the previous meeting or just check out the Governance at a Glance Thread yourself.   An Explanation of Continuous Voting and the Peculiarities of the 7/26 Executive Stability Fee Vote  Contains a brief summary of how passing a vote actually works. The most recent executive vote on 7/19 passed with ~32k MKR. The 7/19 proposal passed because it had more votes than the current hat; however, since then someone has moved an old proposal with 78k MKR to the current hat. Now voters need to beat 78k MKR in order to pass a vote. This is an issue of UX and friction rather than a real risk. This will require more MKR to be rallied to vote if we want changes passed(which is not necessarily a bad thing). The issue is that forgotten MKR voting on old proposals creates a blocker on new Executive proposals that want to get passed.    Twitter account @mkrgov to keep MKR holders updated and involved in regards to governance  Idea for a bot on twitter that tweets governance updates. Marc, creator of @MakerDaiBot said he was looking into it. Would increase visibility of Maker Governance to the MKR holders who don\u2019t necessarily spend a lot of time on the forums or calls. Gives one more location for information to propagate from.    Analytics Primoz Kordez: MakerDAO metrics platform in collaboration with Santiment 12:47  The company I run is called BlockAnalytica. We work together with Vishesh and Cyrus for some time helping to develop the risk model for MakerDAO. During this time I came across Santiment which was able to provide me with technical support for building this platform which I will present now. Relevant Links  Santiment MakerDAO Stats  Analysis  Network Activity Section (Dai)  Daily Active Addresses Graph shows increasing number of active addresses. 2k before the recent spike caused by the Coinbase promotion. Network growth(daily new Dai wallets) is also on an upward trend. Rising transaction volume spikes seem to correlate with upward movements in Dai price. This is likely from increased trading volume when people are buying Dai. Mean transaction value approximately 3k-5k, median transaction value is around 2k. Daily Token Circulation graph shows the amount of tokens that circulate every day. This figure is approximately 5% of the total supply per day. In comparison to ETH\u2019s 2% velocity, 5% is pretty high for a token. Dai is doing well as a Medium of Exchange token.   CDP Stats  In this section we wanted to show CDP activity like locks, frees, wipes, draws, and so on. These graphs can overlay the ETH price and user behavior can be viewed in this section. You can also choose to denominate the graphs in ETH or Dai value. Coinbase effect shows a lot of locks recently, but as you see from the value of collateral it is not much. Recently many larger CDPs freed collateral, likely connected to refinancing to Secondary Lending Platforms. Before the Coinbase boom, we saw between 20 and 30 new CDPs every day. There is also a graph of Collateral locked in CDPs which categorizes CDPs according to different collateral amounts. We can see through this graph that whales were the main reason for total collateral in the system to drop over the past few months. There is a graph for Stability Fees paid. We recently had a record from one of the CDPs, 135k in fees paid. What\u2019s interesting is that he paid his fee in Dai, so this event might have caused MKR price to go up. We have a bites graph as well, which is connected with the activity of recent liquidations. We can see the volume is less than last year, however the number of overall bites is higher. Most of the liquidations that happened recently affected smaller CDPs, where in the history larger CDPs were liquidated. It looks like large CDPs learned their lesson and are not taking on as much risk as in the past. We have individual graphs for each action type, and it is color categorized for various CDP sizes.   Collateral Stats  This section covers Dai supply, Eth locked in CDPs, Collateralization Ratio, and more. We have a chart called Nominal Collateralization Ratio. It checks the amount of Ether versus Dai supply. It isolates from Ether price, which helps us see user behavior more clearly. When ETH was dropping we can see users added collateral. Once ETH began rising users freed collateral. We also have Collateralization Ratio graph which includes indicators for different CDP sizes. The Collateral Circulation graph is meant to try to show how much Dai issued from CDPs is converted to ETH and placed into CDPs. We try to answer the question, how much ETH locked in MakerDAO is on leverage. You can see the ratio being between 10-30%. This can be used to detect when people are bullish and taking on more leverage.   DAI & MKR Holder Structure  We have balances of Dai or MKR held. This comes handy when you want to identify Dai demand. I will present Dai now. Holders of Dai are differentiated by groups based on amount of Dai held. Total Holders Balance graph is interesting because it shows which category of user/wallet is holding how much Dai. You can actually see that when total Dai supply falls it is usually the largest Dai holders who have corresponding drops in Dai held. This tells us that they might be market makers. It could be good proxy to measure Market Maker inventories. We have a Holders Breakdown graph which classifies addresses that hold Dai into various categories like Derivatives, Loan/Margin, Payment Providers, Sidechain, Bounties, Treasury, CEX, DEX and more. We were able to categorize almost one third of all addresses that hold Dai. These categories can be opened up and broken down into their sub-parts with the tool directly below the Holders Breakdown graph.   CDP Owner Balances  We want to see how much spare capital CDP owners have. You can imagine a CDP owner has an address from which they issue Dai, but he may have spare assets on the sidelines. This gives us better understanding of risk for individual CDP owners.   Social Stats  This section is pure sentiment analysis from various sources on the web. Reddit is best, it gives you most inputs. The algorithm takes comments and assigns them as positive or negative. We can see it is accurate because during the period of Dai trading below the peg, between Jan 2019 and June 2019, the sentiment was low as many people were complaining and posting negative comments about Dai. You can play around with this by choosing the source, the project, the time period, etc.   MKR Stats  We are still working on this section. It covers stats around the MKR token like Active Supply, Annual Burn Rate, Stability Fees paid, and soon more. This section is underdeveloped compared to the rest for now.    Questions for Primoz  What is smoothing?  Forming the data into a Moving Average.    01:11:28 Vishesh: One of the things I\u2019ve been looking at is transaction volume of Dai, which has picked up significantly, especially compared to trading volume of Dai. To me this is primarily a result of usage in smart contracts and Dai being passed back and forth through the DeFi ecosystem. However one of the metrics I\u2019ve tracked is the amount of Dai held by CDP owners, and so its interesting then to complete the selling Dai for ETH cycle. You had mentioned that one of the metrics that you were tracking was the address that own CDPs that take their Dai and sell it for ETH as leveraging behavior. I\u2019ve found that very low, ATH 4%, is actually held by CDP owner addresses. Can you answer how you think about how this Dai moves hands?  The inventory that you are taking about is very low, and I guess that the inventory gets higher when they are leveraging more. Some CDPs are very sophisticated in that they do a transaction where they do a leveraged draw in a single block. However some trade it very slowly, so they will draw Dai and incrementally sell it for ETH so as not to incur slippage losses.    Vishesh: Dai Analytics 44:22  Relevant links Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Dai Price & Supply  Spread has been evenly distributed around $1. Over the last week we have had a net stable peg. The Dai supply has stopped dropping and has leveled off at around 77MM.  NEW THIS WEEK: CDP Risk 45:32   Wv2VVQX.jpg1185\u00d7580 120 KB   YQx5yLP.jpg1276\u00d7537 67.1 KB   I stratified the Dai supply by Collateralization Ratio buckets. These CR buckets can be thought of as having varying levels of risk. It shows that the overall Collateralization Ratio doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Risk is actually weighted more heavily on CDPs with the lower collateralization ratios. What we really want to be visualizing is how much debt is living in the red zone. Seeing how much Dai is sitting at below 250 or 200% can be a better metric by which to judge the risk of the system. With deeper investigation it\u2019s possible to see if Secondary Lending Platforms took a proportionally riskier share of the Dai debt. This theory would make sense because of lower collateral requirements, liquidation penalties, etc. The aggregate amount of unpaid fees has continued to grow. There was a huge spike in the amount of paid fees in Mid-July. The rapid increase of paid fees narrowed the spread between paid and unpaid fees.  Stability Fees: 49:39   The aggregate amount of unpaid fees has continued to grow, but has actually dipped a bit alongside a huge spike in the amount of paid fees in mid-July. This corresponds to the mass refinancing that recently happened from Maker to Compound. Paid fees have shot up and re-paced themselves with the rate of accruing unpaid fees. An analysis was done on the topic of unpaid fees versus cost of liquidation. It was shown that there are no CDPs that even come close to having the liquidation penalty be smaller than the unpaid fees on given CDPs. These are positive stats.  Secondary Lending Platforms: 51:29   Rates have begun to come back down again. Utilization has lowered as well. The Dai supply overall has gone down as the 20.5% SF has remained so there was no clear change that would have changed things for SLPs. This change is likely a result of some deleveraging: people paying back loans on Compound while borrow volume overall has not increased to offset it. Excess supply on SLPs shot up without new Dai being reflected in the overall Dai supply, which signifies deleveraging.  Questions to Vishesh   01:06:09: Does more excess Dai supply on SLPs without a corresponding rise in Dai supply mean that refinancing will be attractive and further pull Dai supply down?  The first thing to think about is the pathway for obtaining these assets and knowing how they end up where they do is extremely important for understanding this question. For example, if supply is actually contracting and at the end of the day the amount of Dai that lives on Maker has not significantly changed and the amount of Dai borrowed on SLPs hasn\u2019t changed, then you have to think about what did change. This points us to Primoz\u2019s graphs on leverage behavior of CDP users, CDP distribution, and ETH to Dai trade volume. In the last 7 days about 28MM Dai sold for ETH. That\u2019s not insignificant for a 7 days period, but there is very little price movement. I think the most reasonable prediction is that there was deleveraging and that is why we see rising excess supply. I think we will oscillate through this cycle continuously since it brings oversupply to the front and gets rid of it through a Refi opportunity. I think it\u2019s an indicator that some oversupply does exist, and as a result of the overall Dai supply drop demand did take a hit.    Matthew Rabinowitz: Weekly Narrative 54:44   The main point is related to the voting issue that was referencing earlier in the call during the forum recap. As time goes on, the problem of latent MKR becomes larger. This is why there is appetite for some sort of time-limit for MKR to sit in old proposals, whereby after t time the latent MKR would be expelled from old proposals. In the scenario we have right now, 78k MKR committed to an old proposal, that is something the current voters can definitely overcome. However, as time goes on this issue becomes harder and harder to deal with. Our bandwidth for voting is also a concern, since it takes a long time for us to decide and set votes based on a single-vote cadence. This should be solved with the Governance Portal update coming soon.  Rich says, \u201c98% confidence level that the updated governance poral will be out next week.\u201d With the portal we will need to dig through the forum and find the polls that we want to air officially. We will have a lot of work to do around securing soft consensus with the new robustness of the Governance Portal\u2019s polling system.

We had presentations scheduled today, collateral onboarding and collateral risk, but there have been emerging developments in the market to discuss. At Maker and in the ecosystem, in general, it\u2019s all hands on deck. We had a debate about having this call; I think we should have calls even if the schedule changes or if the world around us is challenging. Today is \u201cYOLO themed,\u201d where we\u2019re going to watch the market-situation develop and discuss what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m open to business/agenda as usual too. Communication instead of silence is far better. Give us feedback about the call. We\u2019re open to suggestions or ideas. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   General Discussion 2:54  Brian: There was a 30% drop in ETH price this morning. Oracles couldn\u2019t get price updates through because the network gas price was over 100 GWEI. That has been resolved as of now and has spurned collateral auctions. At this point, it\u2019s speculation, but some keepers have told us that high gas affects their transactions getting through. There is one keeper executing lowball bids of close to 0 Dai, utilizing 300 GWEI gas prices, but there aren\u2019t counter bids against those. The system is in a negative surplus, and minting new MKR currently has a two-day delay.  David: For the auctions that have zero bids, do they go through three days delay where people can add bids to them still, or do they close at a 0 bid? Brian: They wrap after 10 minutes if there aren\u2019t other bids.    4:58  LFW: is $0 a valid bid?  Kurt: Yes. Someone is getting a lot of ETH for free. LFW: That\u2019s not great. D: So the person who is liquidated, they get no collateral in return, and their position is under-collateralized. Kurt: They were already under-collateralized. But they don\u2019t get an amount back that they should if the markets were operating efficiently. You always expect to lose some amount of ETH, but these $0 bids cause Vault owners to lose even the ETH they would have gotten back.  (From Maker Chat) Kurt: it\u2019s impossible to actually bid zero, most of the bids that were described as \u201czero\u201d were actually one wei. 10^-18 Dai is close enough to zero for all practical purposes, of course.    Analysis Primoz Migration Analysis 7:01  882\u00d7690 134 KB    Migration is doing much better than in the recent few weeks. Over the last few weeks, Sai slightly was pretty stable, even experiencing a small increase about a week ago. Then, three days ago, we noticed a drop in Sai supply along with some larger CDP repayments. Now, the Sai supply is about $20 million, which is about 1.5 million lower than it was about a week ago. As I said before, it was mostly flat, and this decrease came mostly from 2 larger CDPs migrating. This happened because before CDPs were defending CR by depositing additional ETH. This was done to avoid repaying their debt. As ETH started to really drop heavily, some of these CDPs capitulated and migrated to MCD to close their positions. I\u2019m guessing that the fallen ETH price forced this migration, as the two events coincide.    This chart shows how many CDPs migrated per day. There were 5-10 CDPs migrating per day, but a steady increase can be seen in the last few days.   865\u00d7338 74.5 KB   Here is the breakdown. About $1.5 million Sai was replayed fully to mostly three larger CDPs. There are about 64 CDPs in total and about 81,000 Sai fees paid in MKR over the last few days. Also notable is quite a bit of minting in the last few weeks: there has been new minting activity, likely from keepers minting to provide SCD liquidity. The current drop in price corresponds to a lot of CDPs being liquidated. There were bites, but the auction is still not closed at 811,254 Sai below 150% We should expect penalty fees to cover from these undercollateralized CDPs. Net, this will be a positive outcome as the system will be getting more than just the SF.   523\u00d7531 127 KB   Here you can see how many SCD CDPs are below the liquidation ratio that are still not liquidated.  Questions and Discussion 11:36  Rich: Is there a trustable resource to track the debt of SCD and MCD systems right now, and the general health of the vaults?   Primoz: saistats.com  R: I was thinking about something a little more detailed. Is Makerscan up to date? P: Makerscan only shows the top 100 CDPs. There is also mkr.tools.   Debt Auctions Cyrus 12:54  The Debt auctions have a two-day trigger delay built-in. They won\u2019t begin for two days after the liquidation of the vault. This morning liquidations started. In a little less than two days, the debt auction will kick in(subsequent executive vote changed this to 6.5 Days). The issue of $0 bids does not apply to debt auctions since they\u2019re structured differently. The current set up is as follows:  MKR lot size parameter is 250, and the bid amount is 50k Dai. It will attempt to offer the market a floor price of 250 MKR at 50,000 Dai. This translates into a cost of $200 for MKR and can be thought of as the minimum price. If that auction doesn\u2019t clear, then it reinitializes at 20% lower. This would be roughly $160. It will keep dropping the price by about 20% until it receives bids and clears. LFW: How long does the period go, where nothing happens, and there is a reduction in price? Cyrus: That\u2019s the tau of 3 days, which is the max auction length. This means that if no one bids at $200, there will be a three day period before the re-initialization at a 20% decrease. What\u2019s interesting is that Governance has the option to tinker with these parameters if we\u2019re aware of the trade-off. If we don\u2019t want to mint MKR at too quick a rate, we could increase the Debt Auction Delay. That means bad debt in the queue can sit longer, for however long that may be. The two-day delay exists to give the collateral auction time to finish. We didn\u2019t have to worry about that until now. We wanted to provide keepers time to get their bearings and figure out what price to bid for MKR. Debt auctions have significant different game theory in them versus collateral auctions. You can\u2019t arbitrage as quickly. There is a lack of clarity on what the clearing price might be. For whatever reason, it may be a  good idea to spread them out over time with that debt sitting in the system. Classically, the optics of bad debt sitting doesn\u2019t look great. Still, given that the ETH protocol layer is so volatile with gas prices, the community might find it a suitable trade-off to lengthen that out knowing that the bad debt may eventually clear.    Keeper Discussion Smart Contract Team Proposal 18:02  BMM: We\u2019ve also discussed with the smart contract team to lower the ETH DC. We\u2019re considering raising the system debt surplus to give us some more padding in the future against similar occurrences. We\u2019re also recommending possibly lowering the ETH Stability Fee because we are above peg and lowering the DSR to a broader band to help recapitalize the system. I don\u2019t know how to propose that as this is a governance call.  Cyrus: Yeah, I think certainly lowering the Debt Ceiling for ETH is probably the most significant. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t hit any OSM risk on the drop. It was closer than we would have liked. Right now, there is a $50 million empty buffer in the ETH debt ceiling that should lower immediately. In terms of the SF and DSR, that is up for discussion. BMC: Also, we should consider using this time to raise the surplus buffer. Right now, it is at 500,000, which is an arbitrary number. Now that we have real-world experience of a market drop, it may be time to raise that. Cyrus: Raising the surplus would still not have been enough to cover this bad debt. Ironically, this was going to be the subject of next week\u2019s presentation    21:18  Dawson: Should we talk about how auction mechanics will change in the future for debt auctions?  Cyrus: We don\u2019t currently have any issue with how the auctions work now. D: The collateral auction issue? Cyrus: We\u2019re going to wait until post-mortem to see precisely what the issue is before we discuss what the collateral auction changes should be.    22:08  Kurt: What are some medium-to-long term changes that we can make to the collateral auction?  Cyrus: There\u2019s nothing we can do for 24 hours because of the GSM. K: We should discuss the critical issues to solve and discuss immediately. Dawson: Is the most directly beneficial thing, to be participating in the auctions? BM: Absolutely, the more keepers online, the better. This is venturing on speculation, but it is possible that some of the keepers online ran out of liquidity Kurt: Two issues: 0 bids increase system debt and increase the amount of debt in flop auctions. The other thing is that if you\u2019re liquidated, you get nothing back. They lose all their ETH. Typically, you get a fraction of your ETH back, but in this case, they get nothing. The system has no resource for paying them back if they got screwed. Right now, the CDP holders are getting demolished. Samm: I\u2019d like to add that this is a severe point. Vault holders could lose everything, and there could be a lot of positions closing when they become aware of this. K: And combine that with how congested the network is, and how high gas prices are, it is much harder to close or reinforce a position.    25:04  SamM: Should we consider emergency shutdown?  Kurt: I do not have MKR to vote with, but if people want to consider that, now would be the time. Matthew Rabinowitz: What can we do to fix this? An ES is a catastrophic move. Is this a critical issue or a catastrophic one? BMM: More than anything, we need to get keepers online and purchasing at auctions. Cyrus: To what extent is this a lack of keepers issue vs. an auction issue as it relates to the ethereum protocol. K: My view is that it\u2019s a problem with either the lack of keepers or their ability to bid. One keeper currently has a massive amount of capital from these auctions, and it can continue outbidding. Andy: That one keeper is sitting on around 100,000 ETH LMC: Because of the gas price, all of the other keepers trying to do the right thing are blocked. BM: The only other thing they can do is outbid, which is suitable for Maker. The problem is when they get away with near 0 bids. LFW: The other keepers aren\u2019t incentivized because they know that one keeper will just outbid them. There\u2019s no need to pay gas prices nothing. Dawson: I don\u2019t think this is a protocol issue on Ethereum. I think this could be solved with a different type of auction. I think the problem is you have to submit a bid at the time of liquidation. Instead, collateral could be auctioned toward pre-registered bids at some percentage below the market rate. In this way, you can allow people to state what they are willing to purchase, effectively stacking liquidity relative to the market price of collateral being auctioned. This is done in advance, rather than waiting for insurance to be sold. This does away with transactions, avoiding the gas price issue in the issue. BMC: That could essentially function like a market-making order book. I like it. K: It would be a 3-month engineering project.    28:46  K: Taking a step back, ETH price has currently stabilized. So at some point, the liquidations will stop. The Keeper who is bidding at 0 will have nothing to bid on and, therefore, cannot hurt us. I\u2019m not sure how long it will take to burn itself out or how significant the damage will be once it happens, assuming ETH doesn\u2019t take another nosedive.  MatthewR : How difficult would it be to change the market price in the auction set not to be 0 but still give enough value for arbitrage and thus for keepers to bid. Perhaps something like 50%. K: Something like that could be pushed out pretty quickly, given the 24-hour delay. It would undoubtedly be an intermediary response and may not help in the current crisis. If ETH crashes in 5 days, this will make us more prepared. MatthewR: While it\u2019s not desirable, this proposed solution seems better than ESM. I know decisions should arise in forums, but I can speak faster than I can type, and this is my recommendation.    31:37  R: This is an unusual circumstance. We\u2019ve discussed technical emergencies and expediency in decision making. Now we should consider if this is a monetary emergency warrants expediency. LFW and the risk team should discuss emergency protocols and what we should be voting on tomorrow. We have to vote tomorrow, decisiveness for an executive shaped by current events would be good.  33:07  Rich Brown: Taking the role of the average joe, I\u2019ve looked at the keeper docs, and I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Do we have resources to quickly help onboard a large number of keepers in the system?  Vishesh: I agree that the keeper system is somewhat complicated. The narrative near MCD launch around keepers was that they are a hyper-optimized and extremely complicated process. This competition was pushing the most optimized keepers to outcompete others. Right now, the problem is we don\u2019t have enough keepers. To that extent, we need someone to come in and make these keepers more accessible. This circumstance is an essential and expensive lesson in liquidation mechanics for securing people\u2019s funds on the system. That was true in SCD. The ability to lose money in the auction system is faster and requires a robust network of liquidators. Accessibility is something to strive for. MatthewR: We cannot allow the price to be 0. There needs to be a market incentive for maintaining the Keeper, but we do need a floor for the price. This is why I suggested 50%. The number is less significant, but it cannot be zero. I agree; this is a painful but essential lesson.    36:30  Getty: I\u2019m one of the guys with grapefruit trading. We aren\u2019t running a keeper because the docs are not that helpful. Making keeper docs more understandable, clear, and crisp would be beneficial. Will make it a priority asap. I would be happy to start hammering this out today.  David: Ed Noepel is our keeper expert. K: Keeper experts are frantically working to respond to this issue, but he could help you out. Andychorlain: Chris Moony said they are working to have another keeper up as of a few minutes ago. We will have to wait until then. Rich: Market makers are going to be critical for these situations. Let us see if there is something we can do to get them started. There is obviously a profit opportunity that is occurring right now.    38:22  LFW: How are we going to decide what we are doing in terms of spells?  R: We are an hour or two into gathering all of the threads and speaking with the experts. We won\u2019t have clarity until tomorrow. We\u2019ll be exploring our potential options for tomorrow\u2019s vote. This call is about throwing ideas on the table and making sure no stone has been unturned. LFW: Should we talk about how bad it needs to be before we do an ES? Should we establish a number benchmark for ES? R: Let\u2019s get some info from the risk team regarding what thresholds we should keep in mind for ES.    Risk Cyrus 40:40  Cyrus: I don\u2019t think there is a specific threshold or event to trigger ES. This decision is at Governance\u2019s discretion. Some rules of thumb to be used are: Is the ESM less harmful than doing a flop auction for $20 million (as an example, won\u2019t be that high). I would personally say that the flop auction is more desirable since Dai will be fully backed.  LFW: I\u2019m more concerned about the Vault holders at this stage. If they get under-collateralized and close and get nothing back, they will try to leave as soon as possible. SamM: I just closed my position for that exact reason. LFW: Frank says that that is the risk you take for borrowing, but it\u2019s framed as 13% and not all of it.    42:38  Matthew R: For people who hold Dai, what does that mean for the average user?  BMM: Dai price at Coingecko is $1.04, so we\u2019re still above peg for Dai holders. MR: The default issue is if you have a vault and the liquidation in there. For Dai holders outside of this, it\u2019s there is no issue with collateral. BMM: Dai holders shouldn\u2019t receive any losses as a result of this, it\u2019s entirely on Vault owners and MKR holders. LFW: Unless there are more drops, then there\u2019s not that much liquidity, right?    44:03  Vishesh: We should chat about price, right? If you look at dYdX, the arbitrage takes the price back to USD 1.02. Much of the trading is at $1.019 or $1.025. There isn\u2019t an unbounded run-up, but it is elevated. There is no reason that it shouldn\u2019t level out. If it goes to $1.03 or $1.04, then people may start minting and selling. We can start checking the mint transactions, but it is entirely my expectation that it will not run up unbounded.  LFW: People will still mint for arbitrage if there is a profit to be made.    45:54  David: I\u2019m curious about people\u2019s views around SF votes, and the DSR spread in this environment?  Vishesh: This is a short term effect due to crazy ETH price drops and liquidation activity. Adjusting the SF isn\u2019t going to reduce profitability or incentivize more mints. That\u2019s a longer-term lever. You can\u2019t use that for short term management to getting Dai back to the dollar peg. LFW: Even if it\u2019s not to fix the short term volatility, should we not bring it down anyway? It seems like things will get worse before they get better. D: Doesn\u2019t that imply \u201cwait and see,\u201d though? LFW: Perhaps. But if each price action is downward and they come in waves, they all trend downward. Vishesh: A lot of folks will feel the same, good point. What I\u2019m more concerned about is if Dai goes back to $1. Then, if ETH is considered cheap, it could trigger a small bull surge if ETH is stable or going back up. Then, we\u2019ve set up a situation in the future where it\u2019s at a higher risk on the peg drifting below a dollar. From a policy standpoint, the SF is about managing Dai trading below peg. Above the peg resettling is an arbitrage mechanism. The most significant risk here is reactivity and, again, set ourselves up for future problems based on how we react now. LFW: I agree, but if ETH dumps further, we\u2019re in a worse position. Vishesh: There was a good question about the liquidity crunch, which a SF doesn\u2019t fix. I doubt system participants want to participate in short term arbitrage because of that long term cost. SF doesn\u2019t factor into short term decision-making process. LFW: Fair.    50:16  Dawson: I\u2019m trying to understand the price run-up. To summarize: as the price of ETH dropped, order books on exchanges filled, and folks started buying ETH/DAI and running that price up. Then, the price of DAI/USDC went up because of arbitrageurs crossing ETH/DAI and ETH/USD books. Would this chain effect cause net DAI books to go up?  Dawson: Because if ETH is dropping, you wouldn\u2019t expect a surplus on USD/DAI unless someone is arbitraging. Unless someone is arbitraging another DAI book like ETH/DAI. (Edit: centralized exchanges like Coinbase do not have a USD<>DAI book) Or was there a surplus on ETH<>DAI because other ETH books were drying up as people were trying to exit their positions to get Dai liquidity. Vishesh: I could see the case for as liquidations are occurring, despite 0 prices, people will source Dai to engage in settlements and pay down positions. A common historical pattern where ETH crashes and Dai price tends goes up. We\u2019ve seen it in the past before. If other trading pairs exacerbate that, it\u2019s possible, I didn\u2019t check though.    52:31  Vishesh: Someone asked about the Sai graph. It\u2019s the same situation since they are locked to each other. VWAP looks like a $1.026. Most recent trades at $1.04.  Mitote: How worried are you about a drop of ETH to $100. Will there be 0 Dai bids and auction problems? Cyrus: I think we shouldn\u2019t speculate on ETH price. It\u2019s beyond anyone\u2019s control. Mitote: We could lose collateral, and that\u2019s a problem for vault holders? Cyrus: I\u2019m interested in seeing how Keeper liquidity improves. BMM; It\u2019s critically important that we get more keepers online. LF: If this guy out-competing everyone with huge gas fees, how much will more keepers help. Everyone else will stop competing since they don\u2019t get anything back. Vishesh: I don\u2019t want to speculate too much, but someone mentioned that transactions were going through at lower gas prices. They wonder if it\u2019s a miner prioritizing their own transactions. BMM: The ones I looked at this morning were at 300 GWEI, well overbidding the gas price.    End Discussion 56:34  Cyrus: If we want to lower the SF and the DSR, what should we do?  Rich: I\u2019d love for other people to interrupt. We have this risk team empowered as domain experts, and they have the authority to pull us out of the fire. Risk has latitude to put in emergency EVs. Does someone want to start a Black Thursday forum thread, so we can figure out the next steps? We should spend the rest of the day engaging actively in that thread. LFW: Yes, we need to figure out what we are going to do.    1:01:06  akivasdubrofsky: We need to discuss how to make sure MKR price doesn\u2019t go to 0 during debt auctions in two days.  BMM: I think the solution is to have Keepers online ready to participate. Cyrus: What are reasonable parameters for the debt auction? To maximize their efficiency, the different options are: 1) delay the start to longer than 48 hours, which we could push out 2) auction duration could be increased once they begin. R: Also, mitigating damage from people exploiting this system. Risk and smart contract teams need to aggressively coordinate today and come up with a proposal for the EV tomorrow. We\u2019ll need to discuss what voting for that looks like. We still have this 24-hour delay and need an indication of timelines. If things are taking too long, we will have to initiate something today, or will we need an emergency executive today? A: Is there enough capital between all community participants to buy up this debt? If there is, what is the long term damage to the ecosystem. Dawson: What is the total amount of collateral to be liquidated? Is there a place to see? There is $4 million in debt but still $10 million in the queue to be settled? Kurt: We could look at the collateral balance of the debt contract.    1:04:11  Cyrus: Here\u2019s the rationale for having the debt auction runs quickly; Typically, there is a lack of confidence in Dai\u2019s price if bad debt sits in the queue. I\u2019m not getting a sense of instability in Dai. It\u2019s too expensive. That would be an argument for lengthening the auction times. Does anyone feel a burning need to clear the debt ASAP, or is it something that can wait?  V: Given that there is less risk in the FLOP auctions, it makes sense to lengthen out the collateral auctions to prevent someone from underbidding them.    1:06:18  Ak: I posted about this in the chat, but maybe we should have some kind of underwriters to search out MKR buyers to help us recapitalize.  Frank Cruz: You want us to decide to wait for system debt to clear or print more MKR? Cyrus: It\u2019s just speculation. If the debt were large enough that the Dai community was worried about price, there would be fears of haircuts. That incentivizes Governance to clear the debt, restoring confidence in the Dai price. There are some situations where the protocol would not operate well with lingering debt in the system, and I\u2019m speculating that this might not be one of those times. Chaser: It would not hurt if we bought more time also by extending the duration of the auction.    1:10:41  Adam Skrodski: For the DSR spread, it takes Dai from DSR to the market and increasing liquidity. It helps liquidity and recapitalizes the system. What risks do you see, especially if Dai is above the peg? I think this is a quick fix without much risk?  LFW: Worst case is we set to 0, and then Dai floods the market, taking it off the peg. Adam: Would it help to recapitalize the bad debt? LFW: It should because we\u2019re not paying that portion of the SF to Dai holders. Cyrus: In theory, if the community is fine with bad debt, then SF\u2019s accrue until the bad debt clears. Adam: If we put 0 bid auction aside, we should have a mechanism to flash additional Dai to the market. Decreasing DSR helps with that. Vishesh: I was talking about the duration of auctions earlier; the risk is something happening too quickly. If there isn\u2019t enough time for other liquidators to come in and bid at reasonable prices, you\u2019re risking losing more money. Frank: So you\u2019re ok with debt staggering on and letting time pass? Vishesh: Those are trade-offs you choose, but there is a more granular discussion about the values to those parameters. Cyrus: The issue we\u2019re experiencing with zero bids is something outside reasonable auction parameters. We\u2019re either hitting protocol issues with gas wars or weird liquidity issues. We can revisit, but we don\u2019t\u2019 have a definitive option.    1:16:39   chat Snaketh4xor How does this debt auction problem affect SAI?  LFW: It doesn\u2019t, but there are other issues I\u2019ll add that to our thread. There is a problem where is Sai is above a dollar. Things get weird. LFW: All the suggestions should go in the thread. Especially the Maker Foundation people, also a summary paragraph of what\u2019s happening would be super helpful. Rich: Seconding that, it\u2019s rapidly developing, but there are domain experts making plans and suggestions. They need to coordinate; as we have clarity and next steps, they will end up on that forum post. Risk and smart contact teams are prominent, but we\u2019re interested in hearing from the ecosystem. LFW: It would be good to keep it short term though. Rich: We\u2019ll have to moderate that thread carefully. Expect to mute if people get crazy; we\u2019d prefer to be pragmatic. Apathy/urgency/denial theme is a recurrent theme here when bad things happen, and then we furiously react. Afterward, we convince ourselves that the bad things aren\u2019t terrible and move on; it would be great if the ecosystem and this group can move on from that pattern. LFW: We just need to figure out the most immediate necessary options, changing how auctions work or other significant changes can be discussed later. R: We have a Governance ecosystem that incurs operational overhead and moves slowly. If we have a dictator, it would be so much more comfortable, but that\u2019s, happily, not the world we occupy. We need to expedite this process and see how agile we can be responding to events in the ecosystem. Offer suggestions and ask questions. Let\u2019s find clarity and do our best by EOD.   Cyrus: Quick recap, it sounds like we\u2019re considering lowering the DSR and SF to ease liquidity concerns on Dai, delaying the debt auction to gather more info, sourcing keeper liquidity for collateral auctions (flip), and preparing for the risk of another significant ETH drop.  1:22:21  Frank: What are we voting on tomorrow?  LFW: What we\u2019re voting on tomorrow may change depending on this discussion. SF came out to 4% | Sai SF to 7.5% | Activate GSM for SCD change, | change migration contract debt ceiling. Frank: did the votes come in this morning? LFW: 4% won a few hours ago. Presumably, in response to the ETH price drop. Frank: You in favor of that? LFW: Overreacting can cause problems in the future. 4% is quite the change to quite the drop.    1:24:35  Mitote: Cyrus, does the foundation have internal thresholds for the emergency shutdown?  Cyrus: Not that I\u2019m aware of, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a thing. Frank: Would anyone recommend that we help pass the DSR spread to 1% since it needs 15,547 MKR to pass. David: If MKR voters want it to pass, they should vote on this sooner rather than later or risk having to wait for the next vote.

I am the Interim Governance Facilitator. Today I am joined by LongForWisdom, who is the Governance facilitator. It\u2019s going to be an interesting call, or not, I say that every time because of muscle memory.   We generally have a list of speakers scheduled for these calls. Occasionally, stars align, and we don\u2019t have a group filling us in on a specific part of the ecosystem or a new initiative. Today we may have a quicker than usual call. I encourage people, implore or beg are maybe better words to use this time and resurrect some of the stale threads in these calls. One of the overarching issues in our protocol is there is no shortage of things to talk about. We\u2019re rarely able to identify and pull apart all the threads that we need to, or at least for as long as we should. There is a log going on since we\u2019re at the forefront of a brand new space; open source governance. Perhaps we\u2019re just farther along than many, discovering things along the way, and other topics get pushed aside as new things arise.   What I would love is for everyone in the call to give some thoughts, questions, or ideas with regards to the protocol that haven\u2019t gotten enough attention or may have been forgotten; Even just generalized questions about Governance and Risk. Take the first part of the call to come up with some questions, and we can see where that takes us. Or we could have an early end today.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 04:05 Governance at a Glance   Goverance Parameters   @hexonaut created a temporary off-chain reference post for the settings of \u2018meta-parameters\u2019 to aid governance in understanding how our votes affect the actual system parameters.    Dai peg thread   @IslandHunting suggests some preemptive action to get ahead of the rate changes that would be required to keep DAI at peg as credit becomes more attractive.    SourceCred Trial Kickoff   @s_ben from SourceCred provides a kick-off post for the SourceCred trial and shares a preview of rewards based on the last week of May. We\u2019ll be expecting a post similar to this each week going forward.    Governance Communications Team - Research Form   @twblack88 is looking for some input into the output of a communications team and puts out a call for new members.    Seeking Signal   Signal Request: Change Monetary Policy Votes to Ranked Choice  Rich: Passed overwhelmingly on-chain. Hopefully, this will significantly reduce the Governance workload.    Discussion 1 6:44 The PR Governance Team   Rich Brown: The PR team for Governance is a fascinating initiative. Normally the foundation or protocol trawls for talent, finds talent, then gives them funding. The subtext is that 99% of the time, it\u2019s related to purely technical activities. There is some need for content, and that leaves a fairly significant hole in our ecosystem. One of those holes is \u201chow does a DAO, a loose collective of people with a shared mission, how do they identify things they want to communicate, and how do they go about communicating them?\u201d It sounds simple, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s worth thinking about.   Rich Brown: We have the Foundation, with bright lines drawn around it, people in this call, people in chats, MKR voters, etc. There is a collection of circles in this gigantic Venn diagram. There are issues where the DAO needs to communicate externally. However, there isn\u2019t a mechanism for community-directed messaging. The question is, \u201cHow do you do something like that?\u201d How does a community of people arise determining voice, what the message are, what channels, how does it get feedback, etc. They\u2019re all important questions. It\u2019s something I personally believe we all desperately need. We need some framework where the community can get together and speak to the ecosystem at large with some unified voice or in some form of cohesion. If you have chops in areas that are frequently ignored like marketing, content generation, communication, project management, all these dark arts that I barely comprehend, we\u2019re desperately looking for that talent.   Tim Black: That\u2019s a perfect summary couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. The form has gotten several good answers from active forum members, which is exciting. I\u2019ll start broadcasting to other channels, but if you have any feedback about how you think a community should come out and talk to itself and the greater public and then pull in from the greater public to the DAO, that would be super helpful. I wanted to add that we\u2019re trying to recruit more people. It gets easier to produce more communications when there are more people there. We do have a RocketChat going that\u2019s semi-private, but it\u2019s not exclusive. Normally we meet Thursdays but are flexible.   Rich: Thanks, Tim. TL;DR, the DAO needs a voice; the community needs a voice or a set of voices. So if you have that type of skill set, please reach out. It would be nice to facilitate non-development work for once. Back to the agenda, let\u2019s move on to this week\u2019s MIPs.     MIPs Charles St Louis Weekly MIPs update 11:18 Overview   This month has been much busier than last month. Last month we saw a sub proposal go through the entire process successfully, which is a great way of testing the entire process.   The second governance cycle began on June 1st. The formal submission period for June\u2019s governance cycle was from June 1st to June 3rd. This period is when MIPs and sub proposals are proposed to enter into the Governance cycle. Upon approval of the governance facilitators, the proposals are given a round of Inclusion Polls that begin during week 2.   This month we have nine proposals that have been proposed to get into the governance cycle:   MIP13 Declarations of Intent by LongForWisdom   MIP14 Protocol Dai Transfer by LongForWisdom   Four amendment MIPs are going to improve MIP6, MIP8, MIP9, and MIP12, for clarity and making the general collateral onboarding process more efficient.   There was also a sub proposal to introduce a Risk Domain team, proposed by Cyrus.   Two collateral onboarding proposals for KNC and ZRX     You can see all the proposals in this forum comment   Order of the day   Today the governance facilitators will review and decide if these proposals should be included in the inclusion polls next Monday. The inclusion polls will determine if they should proceed through the governance process and be put into governance polls in week 3.   Just to reiterate, the inclusion polls occur when MKR holders decide which things to bundle in the future governance polls. As I mentioned, there is a threshold to necessitate the attention of a governance poll, which is 3,000 MKR. So the yes votes have to be greater than the threshold and the no votes for it to be approved. Each poll will have a yes/no option. Once the polls end on Thursday before the Governance call next week, there will be a review of the results to decide which proposals have made it that far and proceed to next week\u2019s Governance polls.   Collateral Onboarding  In terms of collateral onboarding, the executive vote passed for TUSD-A and USDC-B to be added to the Maker protocol, and once the pause has passed, I think 19:17 UTC they will officially be added to the Maker Protocol.  Community Greenlight Polls  Community Greenlight Polls are still in progress for the next four days. So don\u2019t forget to vote on the collateral you\u2019d like to see proceed. As a general reminder, these polls provide a reasonable approximation of what the community would like to see done, but it is not binding, and the domain teams still have the freedom to choose which collateral types they want to domain greenlight and compile their work.  End of MIPs Update  So that\u2019s it for the MIPs update today. I will post another update in the MakerDAO forums highlighting everything I just said, and it\u2019s open for discussion there, of course.  Governance Facilitators MIP Submissions Review 15:55   As Charles has said, there are 9 MIPs/proposals submitted for June\u2019s cycle:   MIP13: Declarations of Intent   MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer   MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments   MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments   MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments   MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments   MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding   MIP12c2-SP2: Domain Work Requirements for KNC    MIP12c2-SP1: Domain Work Requirements for ZRX      Amendments   The amendments to MIP6, MIP8, MIP9, and MIP12 all seem fine in terms of formatting and presentation.   I would encourage people to go through and read the proposals, and if you have a bit of time, look at the pull request to see what\u2019s actually changing. In general, these are intended for clarity, but there are some minor changes to how things work. The semi-major change is the order of the greenlights and community greenlights. It\u2019s being switched to make it easier for the domain teams to decide what to work on. Once this passes, you will have community greenlight polls happen before domain greenlights provided by the domain teams.   Risk Domain Team   Cyrus\u2019s sub proposal to add a Risk Domain Team also seems fine. Everyone knows who Cyrus is, so writing a whole essay about who he is and why he wants to be a Risk Domain Team would be an overkill. Cyrus, do you want to talk briefly about your proposal?  Cyrus: Sure, I don\u2019t really know what more to say. It\u2019s in line with the other Domain Team proposals. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to add.    MIP12 subproposals   There were some irregularities on the 2 MIP12 sub proposals. They were submitted after the submission window due to a minor technicality. Since we\u2019re still getting started with the governance cycle, that doesn\u2019t seem like a reasonable justification for not considering them for this cycle. That said, there was some confusion about the requirements for domain work presented in those sub proposals. As MIP12 was written, it assumed that complete domain work would be presented for each domain, which is not present. So I think we\u2019re leaning towards declining these sub proposals as part of the MIPs process and doing them as the weekly cycle instead until we can tidy up the MIPs process and decide what needs to be produced and present for the proposals. Rich, or Charles, do you want to comment on this as well?   Rich Brown: It\u2019s something we can break-off into during the Q&A session. Process is something that I could talk about for hours. There\u2019s workflow versus process or the letter of the law versus expediency. There are larger issues that need to be understood. Maybe I\u2019m a bit more conservative regarding these things. I think that the MIPs processes will take us months before we onboard completely, we can talk more about this in the Q&A session.   Charles St Louis: I\u2019m definitely interested in talking more about how we can further improve the MIP12 process during the discussion, and I do think it makes sense to push it more towards the weekly cycle and take some extra steps to ensure that we can better prepare the monthly cycle for July, in terms of getting collateral added. So really looking forward to having an open discussion.     That sounds good. To be clear, no one is at fault right at this stage.   MIP13 and MIP14   Rich Brown: I\u2019ve talked about these MIPs in the last two calls. They seem innocuous on the surface. These two MIPs are potentially really powerful. That\u2019s both a good and a bad thing. I really encourage the community to have a look at these proposals because they represent a fundamental shift in the way that this community will work. MIP13 is a Declaration of Intent, so it allows for community members to decide if they want to do something and come up with some plan. We have informal or slightly formal mechanisms, we\u2019ve been doing this for a while, but there\u2019s a significant missing piece to that puzzle that this MIP seeks to fill.   LongForWisdom: About a week ago, I removed the bounty sections, so I wanted to make clear that MIP13 doesn\u2019t actually allow any money to change hands in this iteration.   Rich Brown: Sorry, I might be blurring both of them together in my excitement of the conceptual importance of these things. The DAO needs to have agency and sovereignty, so the community needs to be able to determine if something needs to happen, and then it needs to be able to make that thing happen. There\u2019s nothing stopping that from happening, besides the time and effort required to do that, and there are a significant number of tasks that need to be paid for. You get what you pay for in this world. When you want high-quality work, you want people to devote lots of time and energy to doing something you need to have a mechanism for which they can be compensated, and that is the transition into MIP14. It\u2019s a generic process for transferring DAI from the protocol into a specified ETH wallet address. This should fill you with terror, but the protocol has obstacles in place, governance delays, significant barriers to entry in getting executives past, so there are some checks and balances. But ultimately, this is a very powerful mechanism that allows the community to decide to get something done and get the financing to do that. This changes everything, in my opinion. It\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s important, and requires a lot of thought and care about its implementation.   Ultimately, I don\u2019t see why they should not be included. My request here is that the community dig into these two threads and give them a great deal of thought because these will be the most powerful tools that the community will have in its arsenal. That\u2019s MIP13 and MIP14, please have a look at them.     Collateral Valuations   Cyrus: I want to make a quick point. We posted two collateral evaluations last night in the forums. I know they were mentioned yesterday as part of MIP12, but I just want to make sure that people get some eyes on this. Happy to discuss in the forums, and maybe in one of the coming governance calls.   LFW: It may be good to do a brief presentation about them?   Cyrus: Unfortunately, not today, but sure.     Risk Analysis Vishesh Choudry The State of the Peg 29:21 1174\u00d7525 128 KB   Dai has been at or slightly above peg in the past week or so. Even a slight dip below the peg. That is a positive indicator given that ETH price is rising.   It appears there is an increased appetite for leverage, which typically brings the Dai price down. That being said, it\u2019s not dipping sustainably below a dollar. During previous upturns, the primary concern was not Dai staying above peg but rather Dai dipping below and staying down there. They are similar problems, but they have different results.  Either perceptions have changed, or the fundamental economics have changed. Probably the former. Almost like Dai has gone through three cycles. First, there was hesitancy to arbitrage when Dai price would dip below, and because there was hesitancy to arbitrage, it would stay below. Then there was a time period where through community effort, generating new demand, adjust monetary policy levers, etc. the community was able to stabilize Dai above peg. In the third cycle, after that point, the Dai arbitrage use case has more confidence. Since then, the community is almost too ready to arbitrage Dai and hesitant to let it go and sell it. Though now it seems that Dai has come back to peg from that meta cycle. Dai\u2019s gone through a bit of an evolution in that cycle. It seems, for now, that it\u2019s back to a new normal. Where it hovers above peg slightly as opposed to slightly below, that\u2019s the status quo for right now: at peg means hovering slightly above.    1148\u00d7442 194 KB  After coming back from the extreme price discrepancy above peg, it was still higher than people\u2019s comfort zone at 1.01. Then it dipped below and went above again. Getting back to a pretty average price as close to peg as you want it to be. What happens to ETH next will be an interesting watching experience since ETH whiplashes and may distress the situation again.  1116\u00d7595 178 KB   Under the hood, Dai is up to $132 million in total supply. $119.8 Million Dai is from ETH with a Debt Ceiling of $120 million, which is tons of utilization and is basically hitting the cap.   We\u2019ll talk about why that happened and have a discussion about: does it make sense to raise DC at low SF? If there is free money in the system, do you want to keep raising that DC? If you look at this decision purely from a quantitative point, it makes no sense to have SF\u2019s at zero. That move was made for a different reason, distressed situations, etc. There is a discussion to be had about what strategy we start taking right now.   The perception and psychological strategy? The one where we are restoring confidence in the system?   Or do we focus on where we extend the risk of those holding capital for the system? For those who invested in the system, it seems like having SFs at zero will cause us to max the DC again.     1160\u00d7570 38.6 KB  Dai from WBTC is sitting at around $9.5 million. We\u2019ve seen a few more mintings in the last few days. Almost at full utilization.  1125\u00d7566 51.6 KB   Worth noting it was coming down once the USDC-A SF wasn\u2019t zero. Not a huge use case for it at the moment. Demand is low, and the amount issued has been coming down.   Dai from USDC is at $1.2 million.   1145\u00d7559 55.2 KB  Dai from BAT dropped off in March, floating at half a million.  1141\u00d7559 59.7 KB  ETH is the interesting one. It was at $107 million and then shot up since the 28th. Long term rising, but a slight drop off in March then it resumed a rising trend.  833\u00d7477 89.6 KB 1162\u00d7488 125 KB   A single ETH-A vault that minted $10 million Dai and then dumped it on Compound for cDAI yesterday. Earning that free 0.3% spread since there is technically an arbitrage between Maker and Compound while the DSR is zero.   When those opportunities exist at such a low cost, you have to expect people to max the debt ceiling and take advantage. Raising it in the past, or in the future, needs to come with a discussion about the likelihood that large mintings are for a flash transaction or free arbitrage opportunity. Not necessarily to create leverage for themselves but to quickly source capital to take advantage of an opportunity.   1170\u00d7437 92.6 KB  Trimodal peaks in collateralization where you can find most of the Vault CRs. There is a slight uptick of Dai minted from ETH on the lower CR.  1120\u00d7298 208 KB  If you get granular on the vaults, you can see a couple of large positions at a low CR, like 210% or so, which is comparatively low.  Discussion 2 40:31   Cyrus: There were some discussions in various forum threads that the 10 million Dai mint was being used for the Compound $COMP governance token allocation mechanism.   Vishesh: Do we know the latest word on the mechanism for distribution? Is it based on outstanding borrow or lifetime borrow interest? That\u2019s a variable that Compound tracks as well, and it\u2019s not something that people would benefit from just by taking a flash amount of capital and depositing it.   Cyrus: I wouldn\u2019t know the answer to that question.   Vishesh: Chat is saying that it\u2019s earned only on interest going forward.   Tim Black: Yes, and COMP distributes per block. It\u2019s split 50-50 between suppliers and borrowers.   Vishesh: Got it. So not a huge opportunity but still something someone could take advantage of for a low cost. If it\u2019s a very low supply rate of 0.38% on $10 million is not a huge amount, but it\u2019s not negligible. I don\u2019t know if other people have been tracking the Compound side of things closely. I have comments on that, but that seems to me a potentially viable explanation.

Going forward, we will be posting the meeting Agenda for next week at the end of this week\u2019s meeting. With a week in advance, if anyone has anything that they would like to present, then they can either message us or post in the thread and say what they want to do. That means that everyone will have an idea of what\u2019s coming and if they want to attend. Obviously, if there\u2019s anything urgent, we can add it, and we\u2019ll try to provide as much notice as possible.  Lev WBTC Debt Ceiling 44:58   Lev: Does anyone want to talk about the WBTC debt ceiling? When WBTC was added it wasn\u2019t clear where the debt ceiling should be, but now that it\u2019s being used 100% it\u2019s interesting to discuss this, and the risk parameters broadly, the risk factors for WBTC, the general schedule of scaling WBTC in Maker, increased decentralization of WBTC\u2026 Some of these topics are better addressed in the Forum, but I wanted to highlight here that these are things that I think are interesting. Particularly as we hike the debt ceiling, well, depending on what the poll says, but we might be back into that rhythm again. It\u2019s worth thinking whether the WBTC debt ceiling should be proportionally hiked up to a certain point and what the community sentiment on that is.   Cyrus: It would be interesting to see if there\u2019s demand outside of the current 0% market. Right now, it\u2019s subsidizing huge carry trades. If the rates were to normalize back up, would the demand still be there? At this point, is it a good idea to just raise it if we\u2019re subsidizing a secondary lending platform to take advantage in that way. At least with ETH, you don\u2019t have to worry about the counterparty risk or the decentralization risk. So if the goal is to get the Dai peg in line, for me, it feels safer to keep raising the ETH debt ceiling.   Lev: I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that we should blindly raise it. There are some limits related to the counterparty risk. For ETH, there should be a limit where if you have too much Dai issued against ETH, ETH liquidity becomes a serious problem. I don\u2019t think we know where exactly that level is. Or at least as a community, I don\u2019t think that we have come to a consensus on what is the hard limit for that ceiling. But as a guess, somewhere between 100 million and 1 billion, we are going to start to have serious problems with liquidating. A Black Thursday scenario would be not only bad with what we had with the auctions but also bad from the ETH liquidity point of view. And ETH uses BitMEX all the time, so there\u2019s a crazy BitMEX liquidation already this week. There is also some level with ETH that we would have to worry about. The nice thing about BTC is that there\u2019s extra liquidity there. When this was initially added, we did not discuss in much detail what the appropriate debt ceiling should be. I don\u2019t think it made sense to argue too much since we didn\u2019t even know whether 10 million Dai was going to be generated against it.   Cyrus: Those are all valid points. In terms of liquidity, one point that I want to make is that I think before we hit the constraint of the liquidity of the collateral assets on the exchanges, we will hit the keeper\u2019s Dai liquidity constraints first. Keepers will run out of Dai before the markets run out of asset liquidity, I think. Given that ETH and WBTC are pretty much correlated, at least on the huge downturns, whichever one crashes or has the most Dai outstanding will cause a DAI liquidity crunch. The keepers are going to be constrained one way or another. From that perspective, I don\u2019t think you will get a major benefit one way or the other. For me, it\u2019s more a question of the counterparty risk and how the community wants to deal with it, rather than looking at BTC and seeing if BTC is some small percentage more liquid than ETH.   Lev: I have two points. I\u2019m not sure if I straightforwardly agree with what you said about Dai liquidity. I do agree that Dai liquidity is extremely important for downside liquidation risk. However, I\u2019m not sure that Dai liquidity gives you a straightforward cap on the debt ceiling of a collateral asset, because as you grow the debt ceiling, you have more Dai issue, and you expect to see more keeper Dai inventory. So as a thought experiment, if we set the ETH debt ceiling ten times where it is known, 1.2 Billion or something like that. If we reached that, I would expect to see ten times more Dai available for Keepers because we\u2019re increasing that Dai by increasing the debt ceiling. So it\u2019s not like they wouldn\u2019t keep up with the increased issuance. You\u2019re growing the whole market, maybe proportionally. Do you see what I mean?   Cyrus Younessi: I might have misspoken. If you have a 50 million debt ceiling between ETH and WBTC, if they both crash at the same time, keepers will still have the same amount of Dai constraint, and even if you 10x it to 500 Million, you would still have the same constraint. My point is more that when choosing to allocate between ETH and BTC, you would assume that they\u2019re part of the same class, the way you want to mix them would potentially not be based on Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity versus ETH\u2019s. Potentially there are other bigger concerns.   Lev: I agree with that. You\u2019re saying that we\u2019re exposed to this factor\u2026 \u201ccrypto\u201d or BTC/ETH, and then most is coming for that. I agree that they\u2019re correlated assets and you\u2019re looking at it as: Do you want to split this massive exposure between ETH and BTC. From a pure liquidity point of view, I think that BTC has more liquidity, but you also are introducing this counterparty risk.   Cyrus: My whole question is: is that trade-off worth it? Do we want to have potentially marginal extra liquidity for the added unquantifiable counterparty risk? Maybe we do, that is totally fine, but it\u2019s a conversation we need to have. And I think it\u2019s a discussion that has to happen before raising the debt ceiling on ETH and WBTC, that\u2019s all.     SamM WBTC being used for rate arbitrage 54:38   LongForWisdom: Sam asks in the chat: Who\u2019s using WBTC? Nexo\u2019s using a large chunk, what are they using it for?   Cyrus Younessi: The best I know is from the forums a few weeks ago about rate arbitrage.   LongForWisdom: So they\u2019re taking actual BTC and offering Dai in exchange, and they\u2019re getting that Dai from the Maker Protocol at a cheaper rate, essentially.   Cmooney: I believe that\u2019s the case. Isn\u2019t their rate something like 5% or 6% right now?   LongForWisdom: I\u2019m not sure, but yes, it\u2019s higher than the WBTC-A SF. The follow-up question is, would we expect Nexo to repay that as soon as the rates go above that level?   Cyrus Younessi: Right, above some threshold. My idea was to wait for that and see the more organic demand for Wrapped Bitcoin before we start fiddling around with debt ceilings.   Cmooney: If we are going to raise the debt ceiling, we should do it in lockstep with some sort of function of rate increases as well. Maybe we should put like 25 basis points change for risk premium on WBTC now so that we\u2019re at least being compensated for the counterparty risk, but if we\u2019re going to raise it later, which could bring more diversity to people taking advantage of that we may want to, say, for every million we go by 25 basis points. Some function like that. If they\u2019re willing to go up to 6%, that would be a percent per 4 Million, so like 24 Million or something, I don\u2019t know. Maybe we should discuss debt ceilings at some point, and then we also get that on the lower 10 million that are already there. I don\u2019t know. I made that up literally right now. So maybe we should discuss the debt ceiling going up with the risk premium because we have to be compensated for the counterparty risk with WBTC.     chris_p Raising the rate for WBTC 57:51   chris_p: One comment about WBTC is that it\u2019s not a static thing. There are a lot of discussions going on right now to make it much more robust, adding more people to help out with the Wrapped BTC DAO, and this is something we should consider too when we discuss how we\u2019re managing WBTC.   Cmooney: Does anyone have any idea on how high Nexo will be willing to go for this rate arbitrage?   chris_p: It\u2019s a marketplace. Somewhat unfair to judge the outcome of something because someone has found some clever way to make a market more efficient. I don\u2019t think we should poopoo necessarily on anyone that\u2019s speculating on a different aspect of DeFi. I mean some people like speculating on the ETH, they open up a CDP, and you\u2019re long ETH. Some people see an opportunity, and there\u2019s a tool that they can use. We\u2019re competing against other projects, whole other blockchains, the community should be cognizant of that.   Cyrus: I agree, I don\u2019t think that anyone is trying to penalize specific actors.   chris_p: If what I said came as that, that\u2019s not what I was saying at all. Our problem is that we have 25,000 or 26,000 Wrapped BTC in our system that presumably has a similar liquidation point and would be nearly impossible to clear. If we hit liquidation on that. At the very least, we should be building a surplus buffer in order to possibly handle the liquidation of that asset, and MKR holders should be compensated for some amount of risk. I think it\u2019s great we found a user that really wants to use the service. That\u2019s awesome, but we should be compensated for the risk that the protocol is taking.   LongForWisdom: So it\u2019s not something necessarily bad, but something that we need to pay attention to.   chris_p: Of course. I think that we all generally agree that we should raise rates on Wrapped BTC.   LFW: Yes, we should see what people say in the forums.   chris_p: Yes, of course.     Kurt, Sam MacPhearson, Cyrus Younessi Risk Premiums 1:01:31   Kurt: We should approach this from the core mandate of the DAO, which is \u201cto maintain the stability of the Dai peg and grow the Dai market cap while managing risk\u201d in that process. Would anyone disagree with that fundamental perspective?   LongForWisdom: I think it all flows from MKR holders wanting to make money, but yes.   Kurt: Trying to achieve those things, the question should be, how do we balance the risk versus the reward, potentially upping the WBTC debt ceiling and what do the rates need to be that balance that risk-reward equation. I like Chris\u2019s proposal because, in some sense, the risk is increasing not with the debt ceiling, but with the debt ceiling utilization. So as long as the model of the Dai peg is holding stable, turning up the debt ceiling and the rate in concert, which is more of a response to the previous debt ceiling being utilized, is fine. I feel there\u2019s a general sense that our rates are a little low. Maybe it\u2019s my perception. Given the centralization and the counterparty risk of WBTC. So we probably, in principle, want to raise rates but just in a way that doesn\u2019t jeopardize the Dai peg.   chris_p: raise them nice and easy, you know. Real slow.   Sam Ma: More generally, I think all the risk premiums are probably lower than what the actual numbers are. I was wondering when do people really want to start thinking about actually setting these to what the actual numbers are. ETH-A, for example, is obviously not a 0% risk. That number is something greater, when should we think about setting it to what it actually is as determined by the risk teams.   Cyrus: It should be moved as much as possible while the peg is healthy. So I don\u2019t think we have broken through the wall of buy-side liquidity for Dai. I think once that happens; then we start moving rates up to their targeted risk premiums.   Sam M: Yes, that makes sense to me. Wait until it starts going up because you don\u2019t want have these jerk things, if we up ETH-A to say 5% because that\u2019s what the risk premium is, then the base rate doesn\u2019t come down to counter it, you don\u2019t want to see a sudden outflow of Vault users.   Cyrus: Yes, I don\u2019t think that you would want to make that jump all at once. That would cause a little bit of chaos. I think you should gradually do it.   Sam M: What about determining these numbers in the first place. Because I\u2019m still in the dark as to what a reasonable ballpark is?   Cyrus: In the Keynesian 0x Reports, we actually quoted the numbers as specific risk premiums and not as what the stability fee might be. So it could still differ, for the Dai peg, for example. You can check our methodology in the forum post, and we can discuss it and see.   Sam: That\u2019s great. I\u2019m interested particularly in ETH-A as it\u2019s the biggest.   Cyrus: Yes, we can speak over the forums or the chat.   Sam: Sweet.     Rich Brown Process 1:07:07   Rich Brown: What I say quite often on these calls is that we have a complex ecosystem, we have lots of things to do, we have coordination issues, we have a lot of people that we call a DAO, we have MKR holders, and the Foundation itself. We all established a bunch of cultural norms on how we do things over the last year or so through the forums, the chats, these calls, and the portal itself. As the complexity and the volume increase, that\u2019s usually the time when people start to ask if we need a process and what they look like. That\u2019s where MIPs came from. I feel we haven\u2019t quite internalized what that implies. We have all things we need to do, a series of documents that explain how to do those things, and we need to transition from one world into the next. There are issues around how we match processes to our workflows and how we alter our workflows to match processes and make sure we all understand what\u2019s happening and when. These are larger discussions, and I\u2019m sort of having second thoughts, whether that\u2019s a discussion for today. If people have thoughts, I could be convinced and start talking about this stuff right now. Or we can plant a seed and, in another call, get into the specifics.   LongForWisdom: I would be interested in seeing what people think about the MIPs process if they think it\u2019s helping in a tangible way. Either now or whenever.   Cryptowanderer: If you see it as a living process, then it\u2019s probably a positive thing. The mere fact that you\u2019ve been able to suggest 2 MIPs that A) Get on Rich\u2019s nerves and B) Give the community some real power. It\u2019s quite exciting. Seeing that there\u2019s a consistent line of thought as the Foundation gets towards this gradual decentralization based on which operates, and the MIPs provide that framework. Nobody thinks that they\u2019re perfect. Based on that, we should become more and more familiar. Answering Rich\u2019s point about how we address these specific pain-points and coming into these meetings with very specific points that help us improve. That would be cool to see.   LongForWisdom: I absolutely agree. If anyone has identified a pain-point but doesn\u2019t feel like going through the writing of the MIPs process or is nervous about whatever, you can talk to me, or Charles or anyone for help or advice so you don\u2019t feel like you have to do everything by yourself.   Rich: I\u2019m not sensing a strong outpour of deep thoughts about where we\u2019re at. So maybe we\u2019ll formalize it, and bring it back in another call, or it might come back organically. This might be a good time to wrap things up finalize the call unless there\u2019s any other order of business.     Outro Rich Brown 1:13:33  Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back next week with more exciting adventures of Maker governance. Thanks for the presentations, the questions, the discussions about WBTC, and we\u2019ll be posting the video one the social channels. Thanks, everyone.

There is always room for improvement.  We will be alternating the order of these calls. This week, we will begin with Governance as usual, but next week we will start with Risk.   Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance  We have two active forum polls around the mandates for Risk Teams and the Governance Facilitator.  These will be the first forum polls that will inform an on-chain Governance Poll. Mandate: Risk Teams(Poll inside) Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators(Poll inside)   Delegation MKR voting is the highest requested feature in our Governance ecosystem.  Interesting idea from Chris Hobcroft using Aaragon We want feedback from the community about this. There are others in the community beginning to come up with solutions for this.   Open Questions for the Governance community:  What is consensus in the context of MakerDAO? When has consensus been reached? How much consensus is enough to trigger a Governance Poll? and many more Help us refine the Signaling guidelines thread.   Decisions made through Governance are not permanent. If we make a move, we can always go back and change things if they don\u2019t work.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 12:54   Governance at a Glance Thread  Why aren\u2019t MKR Holders voting?  Most engaged thread this week Got mixed results, but came away with a long list of reasons why people don\u2019t vote. Discussions around the incentives and disincentives to voting. Have you voted in the past but don\u2019t anymore? Share your reasons here!    Mandate: Risk Teams  Poll is up! Discuss open points if you feel there are any.    Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators  Poll is up! Discuss open points if you feel there are any.    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  We are at 62% consensus with 24 voters. We seem to lack a strong signal for a specific option yet.    Risk Cyrus Risk Team Mandate brief recap 20:00   The risk team mandate is a proposal for a structure around Risk Teams and how they are onboarded into the governance system and what kind of documentation MKR holders can and should expect from them. Certain areas were kept intentionally vague since a lot of governance is hard to predict, and we don\u2019t want to be very hard on our stance around these processes. We always want to be open to iteration. The Risk Team mandate will be an ongoing topic of conversation for the coming weeks and months.  Questions  Around how we hire individual people within risk teams, do you see people having an issue with doing that publicly?  The first impulse is to say I don\u2019t think so. But it ties into another question I want to address: are there risk teams behind the scenes, what\u2019s the status of that? There aren\u2019t any unknown risk teams behind the scenes. We envision trying to lean on community outreach. For example, collateral partners may recommend individuals to help with risk assessment efforts. I see my role as a facilitator to collaborate with the collateral partner in the search for an independent risk team that can work on the assessment of these assets. This of course needs some sanity check by people who are not affiliated with the collateral partners themselves. In regards to the original question about public hiring, it might make sense to outsource this work to a professional firm. Though in either case, I feel it might be okay. Perhaps in some edge cases, it might not work. But the larger question is, to what extent can all MakerDAO processes be public? We may run into this issue with data sets that contain sensitive or private information.   Do you have a sense of who will be the first example of outsourcing advisors from collateral partner communities?  REP may be a good first example. Perhaps someone from the Augur community would advise as a professional on the technical risk side of Augur. We\u2019ve had other crypto assets that were not on the asset priority list submit onboarding applications. This is also a practical first example.    Vishesh Dai Analytics 30:49  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph State of the Peg  Last 24hrs, pretty significant Dai trading volume at around 7MM. The VWAP is about 0.01 above $1. Over the last 7 days, roughly 0.01-0.02 above $1. However, on average, it is looking healthy.  TFBmIYu.jpg1839\u00d7691 103 KB   In the last day or two, we\u2019ve seen more Dai removed than created. Collateral was added as we saw the ETH price falling; this is now expected behavior. Liquidations did happen, but not at the same scale as when ETH dipped two weeks ago.  People seem to be managing risks better, so we\u2019ve seen less liquidation amounts in price downturns than last year(see image below).     iiT3w1b.png933\u00d7446 87.9 KB   Looking at the cumulative graphs: The amount of collateral being locked in the system was consistently growing. The amount of collateral being removed from the system voluntarily was being outpaced initially in the first part of 2019, has picked up pace in mid-2019, and has now flatlined. This makes sense since while ETH price was rising, re-leveraging was happening, and now with the drop, it\u2019s become flat. ETH price movement correlating with collateral behavior is a pretty well-observed phenomenon at this point and is predictable. In the last couple of weeks the wipe rate has slowed down, and so for the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a relatively stable Dai supply as a result. The variability of Dai price has been lower now than in the past.  We saw significant variability earlier in the year. Dai is relatively stable, but it is stable slightly above $1 for the last week.   The SF adjustment downward to 18.5% didn\u2019t push the peg down to $1, and also didn\u2019t increase variability.  There was not a ton of movement in the Dai supply in response to this change. The fear of a lower SF, causing more leveraged behavior to drop the Dai price hasn\u2019t happened.    Questions & Discussion on Monetary Policy   41:35: Regarding urgency  Flashback to July, where the urgency was highest. We are actually not in a scary situation right now. I don\u2019t see anything right now that should prompt worry that price is too high. I don\u2019t think Dai has been trading too consistently above a dollar for too long. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any huge imbalance going on right now.   The real question is about magnitude and frequency of SF changes  From a process management standpoint, consistent small changes is a better practice than infrequent large changes. small&frequent > large&infrequent    51:30: Discussion about frequency  The actual changes to the system don\u2019t happen consistently, even though we poll and vote on a regular cadence. You talk about isolating variables, would it be easier to isolate different variables to get a better understanding of the effects of SF adjustments? Vishesh: It wouldn\u2019t be easier to isolate magnitude over frequency. Matthew R: The more time goes on it might be easier to see the data in terms of calendar years. Right now the system is still very early and statistical significance is harder to pinpoint.    55:53: Discussion about how this related to the idea of changing to exponential rate stepping in the SF adjustment polls. Can we create a better cadence based on the current past data?  Vishesh: I think right now there is a lack of history. But from a common sense standpoint, if you are basing your decision on one week of market data you might not be making the right decision or at least you should have a low confidence in the correctness of your decision.    1:00:22: Do we see evidence that MKR holders are happier to raise rates than to lower them?  Vishesh: It seems to be that there are different voices in the community that take over at different times. There are sets of people that advocate for each in different contexts. I don\u2019t see any clear evidence. Vishesh: Smaller magnitude changes lower your risk of mis-managing the system. This is the recommendation that I will most often stick to.    01:04:18: Discussion around MKR voter and community member motives for advocating SF adjustments  Stability seekers vs competitiveness of rates vs etc. Vishesh: In the chats, what\u2019s being discussed is a combination of all of these things. There is certainly an element of doves seeking competitiveness of rates. We even see this vocalized in calls when we hear people say, \u201csince there is no crisis can we try lowering the rates?\u201d Matthew R: It seems like there is \u201cMonetary Inertia\u201d for directional trends of SF changes.    Questions and Discussion on Governance   01:12:32: Referencing the thread on Parallelism, why wait too long, why not put up Governance Polls more quickly to gather soft consensus on many points of discussion?  Rich: The reason we don\u2019t yet is because it just started, and we\u2019re too busy. The flood gates have been open, and we are preparing to do all of the things we\u2019ve been planning to do for the past few months.    1:17:10: I want to avoid the situation where we get a majority in the forum for something, and we move it on-chain thinking it\u2019s ok, then having a whale shutting down the whole thing.  It is a valid thing to happen, but may be very distressing for people who are voting in forum polls. Rich: we need to reiterate that the forum polls are just a weak signaling method and that ultimately it is MKR holders who decide on changes. Forum polls are not Sybil-resistant, they don\u2019t even check for whether people have skin in the game (own MKR) or don\u2019t. We need to move into the mode of pushing the community to do their best to educate about and campaign for the decisions they think are best for the system. Smaller holders and the governance community as a whole need to \u201cconvince the whales\u201d or create a movement amongst a group of smaller voters to represent what they want in the voting system.    01:23:00: How long would a Governance Poll for the mandates reasonably last? 3 weeks? 4 weeks?  We have no idea what the communities appetite is for this. The rough guess is 2 weeks for discussion, 1 week for polling. I think after the first try we will change the duration in the future if there is need for it. LFW: There are other solutions to be explored.

We\u2019ve had these daily because of an aggressive focus on monetary policy and governance in the last few days. We have more individual items to discuss today, as opposed to longer threads in the past week. LongForWisdom has a list of topics to dig into, based on top forum activity.   One of the topics from LFW is how to manage PR as a community.   We should also consider the topic of onboarding other stablecoins to spread out potential risks of introducing USDC. We can assign risk profiles to certain collateral, so we\u2019ll consider that for other assets.   We\u2019ll have a presentation regarding the flop auctions as well as their UI. These auctions are going on right now and are very important.   Please get on the mic today to keep the conversation vibrant. This is the place for campaigning, discovery, review, etc., if you have opinions about how the protocol should move. Those threads go to posts on the forms; those posts become polls, those polls become action. That\u2019s the lifecycle, and if you feel strongly about anything, this is open governance, and it works.   Give us feedback about the call.

In flop auctions, if there is a bid, the timer restarts the six hours auction duration? If they keep bidding, the clock moves up to a maximum of 3 days?   Vamsi: Basically, yes. The auction will still end after the three-day mark, which is the maximum auction duration (tau).   D: This isn\u2019t the case for collateral auctions.   V: The only reason that isn\u2019t the case for collateral auction is that both the bid and the auction time expiry is 6 hours.     Adrian Le Bas Auctions UI Walkthrough 12:31  1144\u00d7790 101 KB    We\u2019ll go through this again, like yesterday, but a little more calmly. You can see live auctions on mainnet. I\u2019m currently on Kovan.   A reminder that this app is seven days old, so it\u2019s still in beta.    779\u00d7636 104 KB   These are the current auctions happening right now. Looking at the tau and ttl . Grey is the tau of the whole option.   762\u00d7631 207 KB   We did add a glossary with descriptors. We\u2019ll edit the text to make it clearer and correct any typos in the next few hours.   1003\u00d7280 34.2 KB   Filters should help with exploring Mainnet auctions. If you\u2019re participating or want to display on-going auctions, you can do that here. If you can\u2019t connect your keeper via the wallet UI, you can filter by bidder ID.   1039\u00d7462 60.7 KB    Assuming you are connecting with a cold wallet, you\u2019ll have to authorize the transactions to unlock your balances.   Deposit and withdraw goes to your locked amount in the Vat. You can see the authorized amounts at the top of the screens.    754\u00d7145 29.2 KB   Assuming your balances are right, you can pick an auction in the kick state, or you can find one that has dent, and you can outbid that current bidder.   722\u00d7285 66.7 KB   Now you\u2019re the current winning bidder. You\u2019ll also see the error thrown if you aren\u2019t within the 3% adjustment, as Vamsi explained earlier.   737\u00d7114 13.2 KB    One thing to keep in mind, as an active bidder, is that the filter by bidder ID functionality becomes more relevant for you. You can use them to keep an eye on the auctions you\u2019re participating in. If you win, you can press the deal button and can get the MKR in your wallet faster. Bots will be calling deal, the function to settle the auction, automatically but if something happens to them, you can use this button on the UI to deal manually.   Petru: As a note, when you\u2019re the successful bidder, there is no transaction incoming of MKR coming to your address. There is just a change in the smart contract, updated with your address. When you are the winning bidder, you\u2019ll see a \u2018mint\u2019 event in the smart contract. If you check your balance, there will be an update without having any new inbound transactions.   Adrian: We\u2019re going to continue to work on the UI to squash bugs, make sure it\u2019s performing well and can run 100 parallel options. We feel good about the cache API. Once it\u2019s good, we\u2019re going to jump into flip auctions and then later flap auctions.   Quesitons 22:29   chat Devin: So are there only 13 auctions going on right now? How do I see if there are any auctions with 0 bids? When will more auctions kick-off?  The liquidation and collateral auctions happen over time, and the rest of the auctions will happen over time as well. The question was answered in the chat by Cyrus.    chat BrainMcMichael: By comparison, if you dump 50k Dai into Dex.ag right now, you\u2019ll get 182 MKR at a price of 274.23 each. Current auctions are still a 20% discount to the market.   23:50   Rich: Have we seen a complete life cycle occur yet? Or is it still going?   C: It will take 6-72 hours to see the complete life cycle of a given auction. You can see the system debt go down in real-time in Dai stats. Every time an auction is started, the system recognizes that some of the debt is cleared.   The MakerDAO backstop syndicate is also up and running. The barrier to entry is much lower now, thanks to the UI.     26:13   Cyrus: There is also a bit of a rally in the crypto market right now, so there is a noticeable difference in pricing. An interesting edge case with auctions too, where if the market rally continues, we may see more and more bids. This first round of auctions may conceivably take one or two days as more and more people take advantage of the longer duration. Three days is the upper bound, though.   LFW: Good for the system?   Cyrus: Correct.   Kurt: More precisely, it\u2019s good for MKR holders. As the auctions continue with higher bidding, the system gets more recapitalized. The higher things go up the less dilution of MKR.     Risk Cyrus USDC 28:05   There has been an enormous amount of discussion and chatter in the forums regarding USDC.   The community should be targeting the specific use cases for the USDC collateral type. The primary reason for adding this collateral type is to provide liquidity to auction keepers who face a shortage of Dai during heavy auction active days. Dai liquidity was a critical factor in zero-bidding last week.   At the same time, severe dislocation in the Dai price trading at $1.08/$1.09, a lot of regular keepers are using the USDC collateral type to help arbitrage the price back down. While it\u2019s not easy to draw perfect causation, the Dai price has improved significantly since USDC has been added. 6 million Dai has been generated in a short amount of time. Tracking this Dai on-chain, it is easy to see that a lot of it has been hitting dexes and secondary lending platforms for peg arbs. I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Dai being generated is helping the Dai price.  The Downside is we are rapidly eating away at the 20 million DC of USDC as it is currently at only 14 million of room left. If we suffer another extreme price drop, auction keepers will once again have reduced Dai liquidity capacity from the USDC collateral type.    The most elegant solution that I\u2019ve seen is to add a separate USDC collateral Vault type. One can be allocated toward arbitrage, with the other reserved for auction keeper liquidity. The methodology is to price out one use case vs. another. Some of the risk that I\u2019ve been working on is trying to estimate what the ROI on Dai peg arbitrage might be, based on Dai requirements and length of time of potential trade, with a subsequent increase in SF above that number.   The question is: how high does that SF need to be? I\u2019m not quite sure right now. Initial estimates are 50% SF range. If you can borrow Dai at 50% less SF, and make some assumptions based on how long it takes to make the trade, it will potentially not be worth it to sell at $1.03 or $1.04. There is also the separate question of: why would we want to cap the amount of DC for peg arbitrage? Why not allow as much USDC as possible so that the peg can quickly return to one dollar USD? The answer is if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re likely to see perpetual day-to-day exposure of USDC in the collateral pool. This may be undesirable to the community. For the auction keepers, it would only be in the system for a short burst of time. Potentially a couple days or weeks, if that, which is significantly less long-term exposure. Governance may not want to accommodate too high of a DC.     Discussion and Comments 34:25   \u2019chat Matt Lucas: Why keep two separate facilities(Vault types) for USDC rather than just keep a single one with high SF and treat it only for emergency liquidity for auction keepers?   That was another idea. I think the short-term improvement to the Dai peg is welcome. In terms of demographics, I think keepers are flexible in how they make money. This question is more about what kind of USDC exposure does governance wants to have: perpetual day-to-day in one case and short-bursts in another.   ML: We would be much more comfortable in keeping this only as an emergency facility. While bringing the Dai price back down is welcome, it is less pressing than the potential black-list risk of USDC on an on-going basis. To me, it isn\u2019t worth the trade-off.   C: I tend to agree with you. At the very least, we need some more discussion on the Dai peg use-case.   LFW: On the peg case, that does also help in the case of a liquidity crunch. While we want auctions to be successful, we also want Vault owners to close their vaults before they get liquidated. They will be more willing to do that and lose less if Dai is closer to one dollar.   Kurt: There is an inherent systemic risk in arbitrage based on USDC since it won\u2019t go up in price with the rest of the crypto markets. When someone arbitrages the Dai peg with USDC, they depend on the Dai peg to go back down to where they can profitably close their position. If the Dai peg doesn\u2019t come back down and fees accumulate, there will be a liquidity crunch of people closing positions before they go negative.   LFW: I see it more as spreading the risk out, spreading the crunch out across a longer time scale.   Kurt: You\u2019re spreading the risk out, hoping the markets will recover. But if they don\u2019t recover, it can be worse. It\u2019s a gamble.   Cyrus: There is clearly a use-case for the peg arbitrage, but we need to spend enough time pricing the risk and figuring out what kind of exposure we want. For the auction keeper liquidity, the exposure risk is significantly lower because we would essentially not expect to have USDC in the collateral portfolio unless it was an extreme situation, and you wanted to assume that risk. For right now, we\u2019re coming up to a position where we may not have the auction liquidity that we need(if ETH crashes badly.) Governance will have to do some work to sort these issues out.     39:16   LFW: Are you able to estimate the debt ceiling that we need for auction keeper emergency liquidity? Is someone else working on that?  C: I don\u2019t know if we have a great way to estimate that, but looking at the liquidation price points and how much Dai needs to be liquidated for keepers as a whole are all research points that need to be undertaken.    39:53   Rich CL: If we keep the USDC open and lower the SF, in terms of day-to-day exposure of USDC collateral, is there a number to which Risk would be comfortable keeping the SF and not affect the other factors? In this way, we can mitigate the peg effect in future crunches but maybe not make affect other use-case opportunities.  C: That\u2019s the million-dollar question. It depends on what you are trying to optimize for. If something happens and Maker has to eat a 20 million dollar loss, I think Maker would survive and eventually stabilize through flop auctions. But that isn\u2019t desirable. This solution involves estimating the sort-of likelihood that such an event can happen. If the risk happens at 5-10% over the next year vs. less than 1%, it\u2019s risk/reward, and these trade-offs will be decisions that governance will have to make in order to derive a debt ceiling that reflects their tolerance.    41:15   LFW: Something to consider with changes to SF on the current USDC package is that the people who are currently using it for peg arbitraging may be annoyed.   C: Yeah, that probably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. If governance wanted to reduce peg arbitrage, then lowering the debt ceiling and taking it from, there would be the best idea.   LFW: I guess the main thing is to figure out the split of debt ceilings between the two. I feel like no one is super keen on increasing from 20 million.  C: It\u2019s still very early. There is still a lot of data analysis that needs to go on. The peg arbitrage needs to be heavily analyzed. One criticism is: if keepers are only minting Dai from USDC when it is above the peg and then trying to cover their positions at one dollar, then the net effect could potentially be neutral. People are willing to mint Dai using ETH as collateral, whether peg is above or below. But if the keeper use case for minting Dai from USDC is too narrow, it may not be giving MakerDAO the tangible benefits that we hope for.    Matthew R: Well, the primary use case would be to bring the Dai amount down from above one dollar. It probably isn\u2019t as useful today, until the markets mature, to help pull it up.   Cyrus: Right, so if Dai is minted when it is above a dollar and then keepers try to buy Dai back at a dollar, is the net effect that significant in terms of benefit?   LFW: The point is spreading it. In a crunch, Dai from everything is going down. Some ETH holders will be more risk-averse than others during a crunch. As the price becomes less volatile, it will invite more people to come in. As the confidence in ETH improves, more people will return to ETH as a collateral type. This dampens Dai volatility and spreads out the effect.   C: I tend to agree with you, just putting up arguments that I\u2019ve heard. I think it does dampen volatility.     46:38   R: Speaking of volatility dampening, we saw yesterday a link that was circulating, the idea being that people are swapping from an ETH vault to a USDC vault in times of volatility. Have you had a chance to give this some thought?   C: I saw that link but haven\u2019t had the opportunity to explore it properly.   Primoz: I can talk about it. These tools allow you to swap collateral without really closing a position in the sense of buying Dai on the market with ETH that you withdraw from your vault. The flash loan is used to repay your vault so you can just do an ETH to USDC trade and then open up a new vault with USDC collateral to issue the same amount of original Dai and repay the flash loan. This means that you, as a user, do not depend on the liquidity of ETH to Dai, which is great because that liquidity is more available for market makers and keepers. This means less pressure on the ETH to Dai liquidity.     R: Matthew, can you tell this about repo substitution. Is that what this is similar to?  MR: Fundamentally, the Maker credit facility(Vault) is a repurchase agreement. Whenever you have a repo outstanding(in the real world) with collateral A, you can do a number of substitutions swaps for different collateral. It depends on the rules, but almost never are you able to do an unlimited amount of substitution. In effect, this flash-loan- refinancing-out-and-then-substitution tool is exactly this. The whole point is the potential to hit the USDC limit and then go right back down.    55:40  Cyrus: Regarding the debt ceiling for peg arbitrage: There are tools that estimate the number of sell bids on the USDC<>DAI pair. Governance can estimate how much Dai needs to be sold to get the peg back down. Roughly about $5 Million biddings above a dollar right now. Neat data point to track.  Governance LFW Adding More Stablecoins to Spread Risk Discussion 57:03   LongForWisdom: There is a range of stablecoins out there to consider. USDC has a certain risk profile, and we could augment the total system risk by potentially adding more stablecoins. The loss is less if we decide to do another.  I don\u2019t think people have done much thinking about the differences in risk between them; it\u2019s just a general argument that if there were more, there is still a diversity benefit.    Rich: What would be the options?   LFW: TUSD would be the first we can look at. PAX and Tether were mentioned, though I\u2019m not a fan of Tether at all.   SamM: USDC is definitely the highest in terms of Dai pair liquidity.     01:02:27   Rich CL: When is the proverbial dust settle, how will we know if USDC was effective as a collateral type?   SamM: Dai price is going down, so it seems like it is working.   Rich: That\u2019s the difficulty of changing things in a dynamic environment. There isn\u2019t a clear evidence trail that demonstrates the effects of changes. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see something in the next few weeks.   Vishesh: The question isn\u2019t the effectiveness of stablecoin collateral. People will constantly be looking to arbitrage if there is an opportunity. There is a question of the risk of USDC fundamentally as a collateral type. It\u2019s more about having a conversation about the qualitative risks of USDC as collateral.   Rich: So you\u2019re saying because we took one type of risk here(USDC,) doesn\u2019t mean that we can justify it to take the same risk over there(different stablecoin collateral.)   Vishesh: Yes, and you also added it during a specific time for a specific solution. It doesn\u2019t make a blanket \u201cOK\u201d that this is a \u201clow-risk\u201d decision.     01:08:15   Samm: Using the USDC Vault Stability Fee is a way we can control for how short term we want USDC collateral in the Maker Protocol. If we go back into a bull market, USDC should go back to 0. If we want shorter borrowing windows, we can crank up the Stability Fee.   Mitote: We don\u2019t know how USDC is going to behave, and when we rushed it in in this manner, we didn\u2019t do a full analysis of the situation. We brought it in for emergency response. We don\u2019t\u2019 fully know if it\u2019s working, but we think it is. That shouldn\u2019t set a precedent for the future.   Sam: The way the parameters are set, it shouldn\u2019t cross zero unless there are emergencies.   MR: We\u2019ve been discussing stablecoins as collateral for a long time. Primarily as a market-maker opportunity. Though we added it in because of the recent emergency, in extreme times, it helps with peg problems. It\u2019s primarily an arbitrage tool.   Sam; Yes, but the timeframe of the position gets lower, the higher the SF is. We can have the control that way is what I\u2019m saying.     01:10:58   BrianMM: whatever the debt ceiling is for USDC is probably what\u2019s going to be the loss that\u2019s incurred if USDC has its own black swan event.   BMM: Gonzalo has been working on a governor-throttle for collateral types we want to keep a tight DC on. Where it can adjust every hour, but it doesn\u2019t\u2019 allow a flood to the debt ceiling all at once. It will be worth the community to consider.   01:13:38   CMooney: For any custodied collateral type, we always risk black swan of join-adapter getting black-listed. We need to price in that risk, except for emergencies where we have an IAM(Instant Access Module) implemented.   BMM: Agreed, and we lost 5.6 Million in these flops. But if we lost $20 MM in a flash because of USDC, that makes the current situation look like peanuts.   LFW: So does that mean there\u2019s an argument for using it for liquidity and not as a peg management tool.   Rich: The risk teams should be able to give us a portfolio overview of the risk. The protocol should be able to manage the risk based on what limits we decide to impose. Is it right that the protocol needs to absorb the risk of losses by USDC as collateral, and so should set parameters accordingly for that? Do we just need to set the limits?   Cyrus: That principle still holds. This is more a technical question of preventing Maker from being exploited in otherwise normal times. One workaround would be to have a USDC Vault type for auction keepers but set DC to zero. When the time comes when it is needed, we could increase the DC through an executive vote. The only fear is a race-against-time given auction dynamics and trying to get votes in on time. The trade-off of $20 MM DC sitting unused.   MR: you say unused, but flash loans and substitutions make it murkier. It could easily repay in a block. It depends on the sophistication of flash loans.  LFW: We would still see on transaction on-chain.    LFW: We don\u2019t have to have $20 MM all the time. We could be more reactionary with amounts.   MR: 100% agree. It rips the band-aid for the first time having off-chain collateral. What those risk parameters look like around something that theoretically could be confiscated. That\u2019s the rest of the world. Real-estate, for example, stocks, or treasuries, bring the rule of law to the protocol. Having a low DC keeps it constrained but allows us to be agile.   CM: We may want to constrain the DC to the system surplus once we add that backup. That way, if we ever took a hit, it would be limited to the surplus, and the MKR dilution wouldn\u2019t need to happen.   LFW: That\u2019s a good idea, actually.     01:20:37  Mitote: I think we need to think about the practical governance aspect. Will we be able to pass these changes during future emergencies given MKR voter response time?  01:21:37   LFW: I guess we need to settle about USDC, so do we need immediate changes? Since we added it to aide in auctions, do we need to change anything now that the risk in the short term seems lower?   MR: Was our reasoning only auctions? The prime objective should be peg at 1.00000. It\u2019s still useful to have it out there for the arbitrage capability to help the peg.   Cyrus: Yeah, I don\u2019t\u2019 disagree with that, Matthew. To answer LFW\u2019s question, we can all benefit from more research. Taking more time to process the situation is important.   Rich: Agree. There are post-mortems to do. We\u2019re still in the thick of it. Using that information will allow us to think about this more clearly next week.     01:25:14   Rich: I would like to talk about correcting misconceptions as a community. Does that align with your topic of PR(public relations) LFW?   LFW: Yeah, currently, the DAO can\u2019t speak authoritatively. We have a voting voice but not for talking to the outside world. Perhaps we can revisit this topic on our next call   Rich: Maybe there can be a group in the community that handles that. I think we should devote more time to it on the call tomorrow.

I am the Head of Community Development and the Interim Governance Facilitator. I am joined by LongForWisdom, who is the real governance facilitator as mandated by the community. Very exciting stuff. Today\u2019s call is packed. We will hear from a series of mandated actors from the ecosystem, which is another evolution of how we do things here. As a specific group of activities becomes identified, they need to be managed, people need to do work on them, and there needs to be coordination. The way that that happens is a domain or a group of actors is assembled; they come up with a mandate and are voted in by MKR holders to assume responsibilities, as evidenced by my existence. Today we\u2019ll be hearing by the Oracles Team, we\u2019ll be hearing from the MIPs Editor, we\u2019ll be hearing from the Smart Contracts Team, and we\u2019ll be hearing from Risk. So lots and lots to go over. Discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance LongForWisdom Governance At A Glance 1:58   Why aren\u2019t MKR Holders voting?  Thread about why MKR Holders don\u2019t vote has resurfaced, prompting some useful posts from a number of community members. Further discussion below    A Liquidation System Redesign: A Pre-MIP Discussion   @charlesstlouis shares some details of possible improvements to the liquidation system being pursued by the smart contracts team.    The WBTC DC limit should be increased   @hongbiao_li argues that the WBTC debt ceiling should be increased, leading to several arguments for and against.    Seeking Signal and Additional Topics   Signal Request: Temporarily process Oracle Proposals through the Weekly Governance Cycle   @NikKunkel of the Oracles Team opens a signal request to use the weekly cycle to process oracle proposals until MIP10 can be modified temporarily.   SourceCred Kickoff MakerMan asks for liquidation report review  Discussion 1 Friction points for voting 2:54  Rich Brown: What are some of the most common complaints or friction points for people voting?  LongForWisdom: So, the initial post in that thread is a summary of everything. Elliot, a user, shared some core reasons for why he votes. He mentioned that the main reason he votes is that he likes MakerDAO and wants to support it, and that took precedence over the fact that he owns MKR and wants it to gain value. I think it\u2019s interesting because it shows that for some people, I mean, obviously, quite a lot of people vote. After all, they want to see the protocol succeed, in a more general sense rather than individually in a narrow sense to make money, which is cool. And then he listed a couple of reasons why he tends not to vote:  The general stuff about outcomes determined by larger holders. Votes being challenging to understand if you\u2019re not looped in. Being worried that voting without an understanding of the issues will hurt and not help. The direct benefits of voting are minimal, outweighed by fees, and the time it takes to research. It\u2019s easy to forget. It\u2019s challenging to consider the long term and make rational judgments as to long term indirect benefits.   Rich Brown: It\u2019s interesting. I wonder if people aren\u2019t being overly frantic. I think that is one of the major friction points, just that it\u2019s a huge pain. LongForWisdom: Yes. That was on several people\u2019s lists. Rich: Yes. If I had to make a list, it would be:  Boring A pain The fundamental tragedy of the commons: Why not just wait for the whales?   Rich: It\u2019s a tough one. So if anyone has any solutions about how we can combat that fundamental logical fallacy embedded in human nature since the beginning of time [jokes], please let us know! It seems that the running solutions are:  Delegation. Sometimes, it\u2019s framed as a way of weighing against the whales, but it could also mean just giving your vote directly to the whales. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s a solution, but there you go. Paying people to vote. As far as I\u2019m aware, that\u2019s never been pulled off successfully.   Rich: Interesting problems. Let\u2019s come up with a magic algorithm to fix everything; maybe a bonding curve will fix it [laughs jokingly].    SourceCred 8:55  Rich Brown: For the people that are joining for the first time or haven\u2019t been paying much attention, SourceCred is running an experiment in the forums. If you engage in the forums and do things that are useful according to the algorithm and the community, you get money back. If you\u2019re interested, look the for the forum post, read through it, sign up and contribute.  MakerMan\u2019s Vault Compensation Review 10:27  Rich Brown: There is a long history and complicated situation around the vault compensation strategy. There\u2019s also a class-action lawsuit outstanding, so what I can say about this situation is fantastically limited. I will say that this is a community-led effort; the community has identified and organized around an issue that they would like to address. The community is working together to come up with a solution on how to address those.  There are challenges associated with that because the community needs to self-organize and then plug itself into the hooks that have been exposed by the protocol, some of the cultural norms, and all kinds of other things like that. But primarily, this is probably the first exercise of the community coming together to create a project, establishing scope and requirements, documenting them, finding stakeholders, coming up with a project plan, getting people to do work, and figuring out how to compensate them. From my outside-looking-in perspective, the compensation group has been having some challenges around the completion of that project.  I think they\u2019ve been having some resources issues. An issue that touches a lot of people in the ecosystem; if you have skills when it comes to project management, or scoping or doing specialized work, and you have skin in this game or a horse in the race, reach out to the group and offer your help. There is a lot of work to be done, and if you can help out, please feel free to join that group. For it to move forward, it needs to be an effective project. Right now, it looks like two people are doing the majority of the work, causing friction in the ecosystem. So if you can help improve that process, please reach out. Working group member forum handles: @psychonaut @LongForWisdom @MakerMan @monet-supply @Vault2288 @befitsandpiper     Risk Niklas Kunkel 13:48 Oracles: The MIP10 Backlog  We\u2019ve built quite a backlog of oracle proposals, so that would be MIP10. We have been looking at the contents of MIP10 and, this is slightly my fault since I\u2019ve designed it separately from the other MIPs, it came to light that it doesn\u2019t conform to the monthly governance cycles that other MIPs follow. We are going to refactor MIP10 to be a more standard MIP and behave like the other MIPs, but we have to do something in the interim for all the proposals that we have built-in our backlog.  Whitelisting proposals  A bunch of whitelisting proposals from DeFi Saver. These are important because they are automation services, which basically will save CDPs/Vaults before they get liquidated. They\u2019re dependent on having access to our oracles for doing this in a trustless manner. If we think about a Black Thursday scenario, we want to support services like automation, so it\u2019s vital that we process this type of proposal sooner rather than later. There\u2019s another team trying to get access to the ETH-USD oracle, they\u2019re trying to launch soon, and their launch depends on being able to access the oracle.  Live feed proposals  There are quite a few light-feed proposals. We have:  Kyber Infura EtherScan and I believe GitCoin is about to post one as well.    Adding new light feeds will continue to increase the security of the oracle, which I think is essential as the system scales. So currently running the live feeds we have:  dydx 0x Set Protocol Gnosis Maker Foundation   I think we should prioritize adding new projects, credible partners in the space for two reasons:  It will generate more of a community around the Maker protocol It\u2019s a protocol for the community by the community.   Instead of referencing some hedge fund, or professional price services, if you see EtherScan, or GitCoin, or Infura, or Kyber, users are going to trust your protocol more. The sooner that we can get these types of proposals into the system, whether they pass or not, the better.  Dealing with the backlog in the interim period  In the past, I\u2019ve usually done this through the weekly governance cycle. If you look in the forum thread I posted, I think there are a dozen references of how we have done this in the past. So, before we refactor MIP10, in this interim period, I\u2019m proposing that we go through the oracle proposal backlog through the weekly cycle.  Discussion 2 17:58  Rich: We\u2019re transitioning from the processes that arose organically how to do governance and moving to the MIPs process, and it\u2019s going to be a phased approach. So, over the next month or two, I\u2019m sure we will be firmly embedded in the new MIP world, but we also have to balance processes with the expediencies of running a business and supporting the protocol. This is probably an example of one of those situations where we need to what works today in towards what\u2019s going to work more effectively in the future. Thanks for the recap, Nik.  Cryptowanderer: I think this oracle proposal highlights the tension between precedence and flexibility. Nik is right that a lot of these applications are really good ones. It would be amazing to see them included in the protocol. I\u2019m very much in favor of doing them in the weekly governance cycles. But it\u2019s a question for this governance call to which we prefer precedence or flexibility. A large part of what Charles put together in the MIP process is about flexibility. So I think it\u2019s great that we lean towards that. But it needs to be clear that there is a tradeoff here. Also, on a personal note, it\u2019s great to see you wearing that hat again, Nik. Thank you. Rich: It\u2019s part of the decision-making process. We need to dig into risk versus reward and prioritize. Collateral onboarding is a huge priority for the protocol right now, but it\u2019s very complicated. I agree with you completely, Cryptowanderer. As long as you keep a vigilant eye on where we hope to be and ensure that week-to-week, you\u2019re closer to that goal, that\u2019s generally fine as opposed to tearing off the band-aid and doing everything immediately. There are different philosophies. There\u2019s iteration; there\u2019s strict adherence to process, there\u2019s evaluating business needs as opposed to social and protocol needs, and more. It\u2019s enormously complicated. I\u2019m not going to be able to unpack it completely, but assure everyone that I\u2019m enjoying watching it happen. It\u2019s a team effort, so we\u2019ll have to work together to figure out the solutions.    MIPs Charles St Louis 21:30 Weekly Update This Week  Seven inclusion polls went out on Monday, and they ended 25 minutes ago. Today, LongForWisdom and Rich are going to perform the inclusion poll review for those seven polls and confirm the results of which proposals can then move on to the governance polls next Monday. After this segment, Rich and LongForWisdom will do that review of Inclusion Polls.  Next Week  Governance polls will be submitted for the proposals that have passed the inclusion poll stage. These polls will run for three days, ending on Thursday.  Just to recap, the purpose of these polls is to determine if the proposals at hand should proceed to the final executive vote in week-four of this month\u2019s governance cycle.   Next Thursday, during this call, the Governance Facilitators will confirm the governance poll results and dictate which of the proposals will move to that final executive vote.  Collateral Onboarding  Mariano is going to speak towards the TUSD token upgrades. Next Monday, there\u2019s also going to be two governance polls for KNC and ZRX that will as part of the weekly cycle, to determine if they will proceed to the executive vote on Friday.  Community Greenlight Polls  The Community Greenlight Polls have concluded, and LongForWisdom has updated the collateral status index. The next Community Greenlight Polls will go up on June 22nd, in the final week of June\u2019s Governance Cycle. I want to note that if the amendment MIPs pass at the end of this month, the Community Greenlight Polls in the future will begin on the third Monday of the month, running for two weeks and ending in the final week of the governance cycle, instead of carrying over to the following month. This helps make the process more efficient and intuitive.  MIPs Forums  There were two subcategories added.   Proposals Ideas.  The general idea here is that if anyone in the community has an idea for a future improvement proposal, they can go in and post their thoughts and the ideas behind it. And start discussing with other community members, getting feedback, and eventually turning it into a formal Maker Improvement Proposal. The redesign of the Liquidation System, pre-MIP discussion, was posted there just yesterday.    Polls and Votes.  This is a read-only category that will be dedicated to providing more awareness and notifications of what\u2019s going on during the governance cycle in terms of voting. It will also be the go-to place to see what the active inclusion polls are, the governance polls, and execs all related to MIPs. That also addresses Andy\u2019s comment in the chat further, about having a notification-type system, or at least more places to see what the active votes are instead of a couple of days before the votes. This category is new, and it\u2019s bare at the moment, but I will be updating for the governance polls next Monday.      Governance LongForWisdom 24:55 Inclusion Polls  There were seven MIPs/sub-proposals on the inclusion polls:  Four amendments sub-proposals, created by Charles. A sub-proposal to include Cyrus as a risk domain team. Two MIPs by LongForWisdwom  MIP13, Declaration of Intent. MIP14, Protocol Dai Transfer.     Inclusion polls have finished. Six out of the seven MIPs have passed. Including all of Charles\u2019 amendments, Cyrus\u2019 onboarding, and MIP13. The one that did not succeed in the inclusion poll is MIP14, which would allow Governance to set a target to receive Dai drawn from the protocol.  Discussion 3 26:43  Rich: I want to make a comment and a question, as this ties back to many themes and some very tasty and meta/philosophical questions. As an example, let\u2019s use any team that wants to do something. Depending on their philosophical and/or political leanings, autonomy, in my opinion, and true agency are pretty hard to achieve if you can\u2019t fund your own activities. So we have this situation where we\u2019re expecting and counting on the community to self-organize and establish identities and organizations, and to do work for the protocol; so the protocol can be aggressively decentralized, and the Foundation can hand the protocol off to the ecosystem. We can see what this world looks like at that point. The problem is that people need compensation for their work, and we do not have a mechanism to do that right now. There are pros and cons; I\u2019m not throwing shade here. It\u2019s a tremendously scary MIP in some ways. Let\u2019s detach it from that MIP explicitly. There needs to be a mechanism where value can be taken out of the protocol and given to actors in the ecosystem that are going to support and improve the protocol. Until that happens, it\u2019s going to be pretty hard to attract actors in the ecosystem that want to improve the protocol. Let\u2019s face it; we all need to eat. It\u2019s worth considering how we\u2019re going to tackle this challenge because we, the community, need to solve this soon. We need to be able to have agency, and part of that is to be able to pay people to do things. I would like to encourage the community, the ecosystem, and this group to look at that MIP, figure out what is alarming or unpalatable, or what we could change about it, and consider what it would look like in its newest form. That\u2019s where my question comes in: what happens now? What is the idea for this? Does it go to the icebox, or can it go immediately back into voting after some tweaks? What\u2019s the next step?  Charles St Louis: In terms of what\u2019s written in the MIPs, this proposal is made through MIP2; Which is a faster process and lasts for three months after the official ratification of the MIP. This proposal could be introduced for another vote, but MIP2 does state that it has to address the issues that resulted in the initial rejection for it to proceed for another vote. Just to further your point from earlier, if people have reasoning why they didn\u2019t want to vote or why they voted no, please provide that in the MIP14 forum post, so we can figure out what the issues were and resolve them. Rich: That raised another interesting situation that we\u2019ve run up against a few different times in the past. If a poll goes up and that poll doesn\u2019t pass, obviously the ecosystem didn\u2019t want it. But every once in a while, there\u2019s an unusual situation where one or more people begin to wonder whether the ecosystem didn\u2019t get it, or if it was phrased incorrectly, or if it was not a good time. What\u2019s the solution? There\u2019s this assumption that the ecosystem got it wrong, and we need to ask them again. That\u2019s a huge question mark, and unless people point to exactly why the vote was contentious, it\u2019s hard to know what to do. Cyrus Younessi: Isn\u2019t protocol funding one of the major themes of future decentralized risk teams and all sorts of domain teams? Is there a competing proposal or some separate track that we\u2019re on? Rich: I think there\u2019s a series of conversations and ideas, maybe Charles can comment on it, but we\u2019ve talked about elected paid contributors(EPC), domain teams, protocol funding, the subfunction, and the buffer. This is one of the biggest rocks that we have left to turn over. And you\u2019re right, Cyrus, it\u2019s pretty hard to move forward with any of the existing domain teams that we have identified and then decentralize those. It\u2019s hard to come up with new ones; it\u2019s hard to attract new talent into the ecosystem unless there\u2019s a clear path for people to get compensated for their work, so it\u2019s something that needs addressing. Cyrus: I was thinking about vault compensation. This could be a pretty juicy trial run, paying some specialized blockchain analysis company to pour through the data and confirm the work of the working group. LongForWisdom: There are several things that would have been useful to have this or something like this to do in terms of the vault compensation stuff. As you said, paying some towards it, but also actually paying the working group members themselves that have been working on it. Several people are working on this group. It\u2019s kind of difficult to convince people to work under certain conditions without remuneration. Especially if we want something to happen quickly, if this were something that can wait six months or a year, it would eventually get done. But this is one of those situations where we want something done sooner rather than later. Rich: Yes, there\u2019s nothing better to solve the problem of commitment drop-off than money, paying people for their time. And there are a lot of smaller initiatives that this type of mechanism could be beta-tested on, so I think that the key is that people boost into that MIP and make their concerns known or ask some piercing questions. My guess about the issue is we have a bucket of money with a protocol attached to it, and no valve on that bucket. So it can be scary. There need to be checks and balances, thresholds, circuit breakers, and kill switches. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out the configuration for this kind of valve to live in before moving forward. Cryptowanderer: I agree with LongForWisdom that there are many use cases for this. I know that lev brought up this fact that we might want to limit to make sure that you couldn\u2019t withdraw more than the surplus that would initiate flop auctions and that LongForWisdom was somewhat against that. But perhaps it\u2019s worth reconsidering that given the results of this inclusion poll. And the other thing is that perhaps we need to be more careful about delineating the conditions around what kind of accounts or how the account that receives Dai can spend it. Perhaps that gives people a little bit more security? Rich: The one thing that gave me pause was picking an account where the money shows up. That made me slightly nervous. If I had to guess what these kinds of things are going to look like, one of these ratified domain teams in the future that we haven\u2019t entirely defined yet is going to be an accounting team. The distributed accounting team of the Maker ecosystem. A group of people can get together and say, \u201cOK, we\u2019re in charge of the budget that comes out of the suck and can handle allocations, disbursements, audits, and reviews.\u201d We need decentralized accountants. This position is one of the least sexy things. We need to accept that not everything is the rock-and-roll world of risk and smart contract development. Some things are less exciting. We need decentralized lawyers, decentralized accountants, decentralized finance people, and decentralized auditors. I think that maybe a team in charge of the DAO\u2019s budget would be able to handle some of these things. Maybe these are my personal biases, but do we want to come up with the perfect algorithm and hope that someone doesn\u2019t spend $2.6 million in fees? Or, do we want to have a group of people who are mandated with making decisions about how much funding comes out of the protocol, where those funds go to, and make some assurances to the rest of the ecosystem that those funds are well spent. Compiling value for money. This is a significant issue, and we\u2019re running out of time. Perhaps we can talk about it in the Q&A session.   LongForWisdom: Next week, there will be a single poll going up that asks whether all six of these approved proposals should go for an executive. So it\u2019s a bundle, intended as a trial run for the executive. If this bundle at this stage passes with a large majority, it\u2019s easy to expect the executive to pass.  ",

                    "content": "Smart Contracts Mariano Conti 39:52 TUSD  Something interesting happened last week. I want to thank the True-USD team. I think we have Hal and Ryan here, and they can talk a little bit to the community, but let me first say what happened on the smart contract side. As you know, MCD works with adaptors. So any new token or new collateral that we use has to have its own adaptor to interact with the system. In the case of standard or compliant ERC20s, as we call them, we can reuse adaptors. For certain collateral types, we need to tweak them a little bit.  This is the case for tokens with different decimal points, than the somewhat standard 18, or with other differences. In the case of True USD, the token uses what we call an upgradeable proxy pattern, so the actual base address doesn\u2019t change, but it gives authorized actors the ability to upgrade these tokens. While this is great in some cases to fix bugs or add functionality, in the case of MCD, adaptors are probably one of the most potent contracts in the whole system. The Smart Contracts team decided that we were going to test pinning and allowing certain implementations for True USD. Last week, when the code went in, an implementation was added to the allow list. Which MKR voters voted in, and that\u2019s the code that the Smart Contracts Team looked at, vetted, and decided was good to go. I\u2019ll post the link to the code. But just as the spell was being executed, there were a couple of upgrades to the True USD token. There was a new implementation that the system detected and wouldn\u2019t let you join or exit the system. Once this happens, you can still draw Dai with any token that was already there, and you can pay your debt, but for example, you can\u2019t add more than what\u2019s already in there. I think that it\u2019s a good thing that this happened now, with a token that had only one vault open and that it was from someone at the Foundation. We were testing the Vault type on MainNet for the UIs and everything else. But this also opens up further considerations for other collateral types that may have this upgrade pattern and what to do about it. Also, the fact that we should have better communication with the team behind the collateral. These are all growing pains that we are going to face more and more, and we have the opportunity to either create new MIPs or come up with some processes for the Smart Contracts Domain Team, the community, and everybody. Right now, TUSD isn\u2019t useable in MCD. For it to become usable, the community would need to vote for the new implementation. The Smart Contract Team would have to look at the implementation and give the OK. I\u2019d like to turn it over to the True USD team to talk to the community a bit, or maybe LongForWisdom can present the community view from the forums.  Discussion 4 44:51  Hal from True USD: Hi, I\u2019m a smart contract developer on the True USD team. Briefly, I wanted to chat about the upgrades and what they might look like in the future. I think this might help create a process in Maker for other collateral tokens in the future. I\u2019m a big fan of Maker; I\u2019ve been using it for a year and a half, and happy to be part of the community. My proposal, specifically for True USD, that may possibly become a model for handling future token upgrades is: before any upgrade is made, we publicly announce the upgrade and deploy the new implementation as far in advance as possible. I was thinking about two weeks before the upgrade happens. If each implementation needs a vote, then more time would be helpful. We\u2019d make a public post in the forums and other channels for True USD, with links to the old and new implementations with notes and audits about the upgrade. The question comes down to the voting process for voting on new implementations and how long that could take.  Rich Brown: There are other things to unpack too. The voting on new implementations, adapters, auditing, and technical considerations could be onerous. But there is a larger question for the ecosystem. We have a situation where we\u2019re dealing with the first-mover disadvantage to money legos. They can be acting more like money Jengas at this point. If somebody updates a library and doesn\u2019t notify upstream about that library, and they have a breaking change, then our money legos turn into money Jengas. I wonder what that implies for additional collateral types and for the wider ecosystem. Is there a need for a social layer to be imposed on top of this stuff? If Maker wants to upgrade a library, do we need to get into a call with five other DeFi organizations to clear that and make sure everyone understands? As we become more tightly coupled in this ecosystem, having people changing things could be fairly disastrous, considering there\u2019s money, or value in motion. Mariano Conti: The solution that we put in pinning implementations and allowing them specifically; doesn\u2019t solve the problem completely. Since much can happen in one block, this is just one of the measures. Perhaps the community thinks we\u2019re going against what an upgradeable proxy pattern means: make it transparent to the users when they are upgraded and make sure they\u2019re expected. Then the risk passes to the DC and SF. All of those are issues to discuss. Rich Brown: We live in a vaguely antagonistic ecosystem where the strongest and most adaptable protocols survive. There are no rules or councils determining who releases what and when. I\u2019ve pitched a social layer before where if project A upgrades that they notify C, D, and E, to see whether they\u2019re impacted. That\u2019s probably not realistic since you can\u2019t predict what the dependency chains will look like in this space. It feels like the solutions need to be more defensive on the individual protocol level. You pick what you\u2019re going to support, and then you have circuit breakers. Does that sound more along the lines of what you\u2019re discussing, Mariano? Mariano: Yes, so I\u2019ll be specific about this and leave the community to be deliberate. In this case, the Smart Contracts domain team has an avenue of communication with the Trust Token team now and the community in general. Depending on how this goes, it may influence writing MIPs or standards for the future. Right now, we have a token we can\u2019t use, so we\u2019ll use this opportunity to see how we fix this now and create a more formalized process. There are a couple of avenues I see. A poll on Monday, perhaps, requesting the Smart Contracts team to review the new code and get out a governance poll either Friday or the following Friday. I encourage people to go to the forum posts and tag folks or me from the Smart Contacts team to talk about this. I\u2019m not saying this is urgent right now, but we should discuss the ramifications because we will see this in the future with other collateral types. We caught this one at the best possible time with the least amount of disruption. Hal: For that discussion, we\u2019re open if you have any questions about the smart contracts or anything else specific. We have a Telegram chat already and another public chat. If anyone is interested in learning about True USD and the nature of the changes that we\u2019re making, feel free to ask questions there. Thanks for including us in the discussion.    53:12  Chris Padovano: Another thing that comes to mind is getting clarity from the True USD folks about how and when a blacklist is used. Recently we had a proposal from Paxos for a stablecoin, and they provided clarity on exactly how that mechanism will be used. It\u2019s a huge part of auctions and being able to process the collateral through governance. Having visibility and understanding of how things work legally would be very helpful. Governance, generally, as Mariano mentioned, with any type of centralized collateral, is a critical consideration to keep in mind.  Hal: The blacklist question is pretty straightforward. True USD is a compliant stablecoin where we take care of the Fiat on and off ramping. The blacklist is to prevent malicious parties from money laundering and breaking banking security. Chris Padovano: I meant the actual implementation of the blacklist and having it in writing. Ryaan Rodenbaugh (True USD): I didn\u2019t see the thread that Paxos shared, but I\u2019d be curious if it\u2019s different than the Terms of Service that we\u2019ve shared in the past. I think it was posted in our original post and followed up on a question about it with a second post. It would be helpful to understand what level of clarity is needed. cmooney: The biggest fear is that the collateral adapter gets blacklisted. That would be disastrous for the protocol. Hal: We would never do that; there is no legitimate reason to. Ryan: I can\u2019t think of any circumstance where we would. I can speak to the legal team to give you a more formal answer, but right now, I cannot think of a reason. Chris Padovano: That\u2019s all very helpful, thanks for providing that color on the call. I\u2019ll post the links in the chat, but the FAQ that PAX put together I think is helpful and gave a better understanding of their process as well. It\u2019s reassuring to hear that you would never blacklist the adapter. This is a thing we\u2019re very concerned about because we would have to re-collateralize the protocol for however much is stuck in the collateral type. You understand the concern, right? Ryan: Yes. We definitely understand the concern. We can check the FAQ from PAX and give the same level of reassurance. Rich Brown: Sounds like there\u2019s going to be an audit trail here. I sound like a broken record, but we should bring this to the forums and have a thread dedicated to this, a place for lawyers to fight it out, reach consensus, get some documentation in place, that would be super useful. Mariano: I want the community to evaluate a hypothetical scenario. We might have to do this in the future. Right now, with pinned implementations joining and exit stops working without a community-voted upgrade; Imagine collateral with $50 million of value in the system, and then this happens. How would we react? Don\u2019t think just this one instance, try to come up with good ways to take care of a situation like this in the future where a lot of value is on the line, liquidations are on, price is going down, and you can\u2019t add collateral to the system because we couldn\u2019t upgrade. These can all be fixed, but we need to think that over. Rich Brown: I love that. Like disaster recovery scenarios, and what we would do in situation A, B, and C.    Comments and Links from the Chat  From cmooney to Everyone:  you cannot join() (add) or exit() (remove) collateral if the implementation changes.   From brianmcmichael to Everyone:  Discussion Thread about the TUSD unannounced upgrade   From Hal to Everyone:   TrustToken telegram chat for anyone interested in discussing TrueUSD or asking any questions.   From chris_p to Everyone:  Paxos token FAQ   From brianmcmichael to Everyone:  Our adapters have full access to DSS and also reach out to third-party token contracts. One real concern is that a third-party contract could change its implementation and perform a re-entrancy attack on the adapter.   From cmooney to Everyone:  It would be nice to see if TUSD has an audit on the new changes, have our domain team check it out, and then vote to whitelist the new implementation.    Analysis Vishesh Relevant Links MCD system stats DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs The State of the Peg 1:00:19 955\u00d7415 101 KB  Total Dai is at $123 million.  $111 million from ETH $523 thousand from BAT $9.9 million from WBTC $1.1 million from USDC.    981\u00d7464 98 KB  Overall, Dai has been trading more or less at a dollar. A couple of swings above and below. What happened with ETH was the price fluctuated downward, and Dai rose up a bit, ETH price fluctuated upwards, increasing ETH<>DAI trading volume and Dai went down a bit. Since the last Dai price rise, there was some ETH price reduction, and we\u2019ll have to see if the trend continues where Dai price stays above peg. My guess is yes. If ETH jumps and dips quickly, that has a tendency to elevate Dai price. These are small differences in the grand scheme of things. We\u2019ll watch and see, but I\u2019d expect it to stay with a slight buffer above a dollar.  1167\u00d7569 86.2 KB  BAT-Dai supply is still stagnant at half a million.  964\u00d7470 38.6 KB  USDC down significantly since May.  989\u00d7472 30.7 KB  WBTC-Dai supply had a sudden high utilization, right after adding it. It capped out close to the DC for WBTC. If we increase the cap, it would be interesting to see how much it still gets utilized. My guess is there are new entrants who want to open vaults but can\u2019t due to the cap on the ceiling.  982\u00d7482 52.7 KB  ETH, as a collateral asset, has the largest trend worth examination over time. With the largest DC, it has the most room to grow. After the decapitation of that growth-curve in March, ETH continued its growth trend. There were individual users performing large mints for short periods. But the lower bound of that line continues to grow. As we spoke last time, around June 3rd, we saw a large mint to generate yield on Compound. A few days later, that user went back and repaid the Dai debt.  1150\u00d7552 88.5 KB  That was the most recent spike and dip you see at the top right in the chart. Apparently, for short term use and some speculation that it was to generate volume for COMP token distribution. The base trend has continued, where smaller positions have been continually opening. The system is designed where users can easily mint large positions for low cost and then repay them in short time frames. Especially with fees so low. This has always been part of the reasoning to keep a short leash on the DC. Since it creates a lot of opportunities to exploit the buffer for short term usage. It\u2019s a stylistic choice by the community, but the room is there to execute moves like that. Especially right now that the debt is back and the DC is at $140 million. That kind of use case can continue to occur.  986\u00d7353 71.4 KB  For ETH, the 500% Collateralization Ratio Bucket had an uptick. Users who, apparently, have put collateral into the system but haven\u2019t yet minted as much Dai as they reasonably could. This over-collateralization brings a lot of latent potential in the system, which is a positive indicator. This potential could be waiting for a less volatile ETH price. Sometimes that volatility can cut both ways because the appetite for leverage is tied to volatility. Volatility also ties into liquidations, which can improve the collateralization of the system. Also, volatility is an indicator that ETH is making price movements, though it\u2019s situationally dependent on other variables. On the flip side, there are lower-end CR buckets of 150-200% to consider. The distribution of Vaults over different CR buckets still has that tri-model shape. There are three tranches of users. In the middle is the system average of 300-350% CR. In the last few months, there has been a rise of the lower end CR category centered around 200%.  954\u00d7260 29.7 KB  You can see that reflected in the liquidation walls on ETH of $150/$160, and then at $102.  DyDX spot1178\u00d7614 355 KB  The Dai-USDC direct trading price, not the ETH-Dai implied price, is in line at 1.0002. That had been higher in the past. It\u2019s come down very slightly, though still maintaining a small buffer above the $1 peg.  979\u00d7344 49.3 KB  WBTC collateralization is almost entirely around 250-300%. We know that there are only a few users making use of the WBTC DC. There is a tight group of those users. It\u2019s slightly less collateralized than the middle-of-the-road for ETH thought, not particularly risky in terms of a pure asset pricing basis. The major wall is at ~$5500.  953\u00d7425 52.5 KB  Obviously, there are other potential risks that come with WBTC. If you hit $5500, you would see effectively $10 million in liquidations, but very little at any price before that. So this collateral pool is quite binary. That\u2019s it for what I wanted to share if there are any specific questions I\u2019ll answer them happily.  Discussion 5 1:12:32  Cryptowanderer: I wonder if you can speak about the stylistic choice of not going in for short term use of the protocol. In a personal capacity, do you think it\u2019s negative or more neutral? What are your thoughts about the more \u201cget-in / get-out\u201d behavior?  Vishesh: My response would have to be \u201cnice try.\u201d It\u2019s a technical capability: there is a system that doesn\u2019t exact transaction fees that are meaningful. Instead, it exacts Stability Fees, which are, by definition, a function over time. It\u2019s how the system works. I can\u2019t sit here and tell you whether it\u2019s good or bad; the community will decide. Once they have a tool in their hands, how do they want to wield it? It\u2019s a structural design component of the system that it\u2019s cheaper to use for short time frames.    Outro Rich Brown Final Comments 1:14:24  Thanks, everyone. Thanks to everyone who presented today, thanks, TUSD, for coming on the call. Lots of complicated things to discuss. How the collateral gets onboarded in the system and what happens when that collateral behaves in ways that we didn\u2019t anticipate. As Mariano mentioned, please join us in the forums to discuss that issue. Let\u2019s not lose the thread: we need to decentralize quickly and effectively. For that to happen, we need empowered actors. In order for empowered actors to arise, they need to be compensated, and we don\u2019t know how to do that yet. If you have ideas about how actors should be compensated, take a look at MIP14 and voice your concerns or ask questions. Thanks, Charles, for your recap, thanks LongForWisdom, and thanks, Vishesh.

Welcome, everyone! We are joined by 40 people currently and still climbing, so thank you all for coming. My name is LongForWisdom, one of the Governance facilitators for MakerDAO, and I\u2019ll be chairing the meeting.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Rich Brown Stepping Down as a Governance Facilitator 02:12   I\u2019m stepping away from my role at the Foundation at the end of the month. I am moving on to a different role, which is an extended amount of doing absolutely nothing, which I\u2019m enormously looking forward to. That presents interesting shifts in the paradigm of what\u2019s going on in the Governance\u2019s ecosystem and the Foundation and a bunch of other things too.   I had a habit of sticking my nose all over the place. Happily, a part of this transition is that it has been in the works for a while; it\u2019s not a last-minute decision. It\u2019s the most amicable moving-on process I\u2019ve ever been involved with, and probably the most bittersweet but mostly sweet because of the teams that I\u2019m handing off responsibilities to fantastically talented individuals have been attracted to this ecosystem. The work that they do blows me away once a month. In the context of this call, the person I\u2019m talking about specifically is obviously LongForWisdom, who came into the ecosystem a while ago and has moved from success to success to success and has been an absolute rockstar as a Governance Facilitator. So I can hand off the mental responsibility knowing that the person who\u2019s taking over those responsibilities not only has taken them over months ago - I think people might have noticed - but is doing a far better job than I ever did and that\u2019s what the community deserves. It\u2019s a really cool opportunity for me to catch up on some sleep, so that\u2019s the situation.   The Transition 4:25  As part of LongForWisdom\u2019s transition from mentor to master, he is officially firing me, and that is going to be a tremendously healthy activity for the ecosystem because the Maker Foundation\u2019s responsibility is to decentralize itself and to bootstrap the protocol and ecosystem. The way that we do that is we work with the community to identify roles and responsibilities help formalize those things, we work with community members to establish what those things actually mean, we help out as much as possible, and then we step away. This is a fantastically healthy example of that because back in the olden days, when we started off these calls, it was a couple of other people and me awkwardly staring at each other trying to figure out whether there was anything worth talking about when it comes to Governance. That has obviously iterated a bit. So now we are looking at a call where there are now 51 people anxiously waiting for me to stop talking so we can get into the issues at hand. The handoff process has arrived, and this is the perfect example of the Foundation taking this opportunity to step away because this process is working. LongForWisdom will be expanding his team of governance facilitators. He has also put out a call for help, so if you think you could help out with Governance, please, reach out to him.  The Evolution of Decentralized Governance 6:15  I want to leave on a super high note and do some self-congratulating. Well, I shouldn\u2019t have said that myself laughs I want to congratulate the community on what it\u2019s accomplished here too. At the very beginning, there was definitely this question: \u201cis there something worth talking about here? Should we have a call maybe every week to talk about this? What are we going to talk about every week?\u201d How that situation has evolved! The work I did at the Foundation and with the Community has been some of the most rewarding work I\u2019ve ever done, and if you guys knew how old I actually was, you\u2019d understand how much weight that carried. The things that we are doing in this Governance ecosystem can feel like a slug sometimes, it can feel a bit chaotic sometimes, but it\u2019s important to remember that when we all got started, DeFi wasn\u2019t a meme yet. Community Governance; obviously, we didn\u2019t invent it, but, in the crypto space was largely unheard of. The constant iteration, the passion, intelligence, and work that the Community has brought to the table here has not only created something special and important for the Maker Protocol, but you don\u2019t have to cast your eyes too far to notice that there are five or six other protocols that have governance now as well and it looks a lot - suspiciously - like Maker Governance. With some tweaks and optimizations, but the principles and the basic frameworks were sorts of my author. Many of them were discovered in these calls and in our forums and in our chats because of the work of the people that come to these calls every week. Maybe take a moment to congratulate yourselves on the fantastic amount of work that has happened here. I know that I will be congratulating myself secretly and congratulating you all as well.  Rich as a Community Member 8:30   I am going to be around, I\u2019m going to transition from the Interim Governance Facilitator role into the role of a community member, and I\u2019ll be joining the rank and file, which I think it\u2019s going to be the most fun chapter yet. Thanks to LongForWisdom for picking up the mantle and thanks to this community for doing something really amazing here.   That\u2019s it for my sincerity! I hope I didn\u2019t get too emotional.   Thanks From LongForWisdom 9:15  LongForWisdom: You have been a massive part of this community since I joined. Seeing you in the Governance calls and everyone else in the Governance calls from the beginning is one of the reasons I got involved. Everyone was talking about everything so reasonably, generally. There were a lot of interesting discussions going on, and I know you are a big part of putting that together. On a personal note, thank you, and I\u2019m sure the Community very much appreciates your efforts as well. If anyone else wants to come in and embarrass Rich, now is a good time!  The Second Generation 10:01  Rich: I just want to touch on that point again that this is this great inflection point where it\u2019s time for this second newer, more energetic generation to take over. LongForWisdom and the rest of the team and a lot of people in this call have been deeply engaged with Governance and actually actively governing the ecosystem by putting forth proposals, coming up with new initiatives, refining the way that we think about things and this is a great opportunity to step back and watch other people do some work, so thanks again!  Forum Recap LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance   Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread: If you have the time to read over and vote in active threads, that would be much appreciated.  Discussions 10:53   This week most of the active discussions have focused around the PEG, the PSM concept, and around other options, we could take to move the PEG in the right direction.   A word on the PSM concept and next steps for the Foundation  Rune shares some details on the Foundation\u2019s focus over the next few months, and explains why the Foundation will no longer be working on the PSM. In case you weren\u2019t aware, I would recommend quickly browsing that thread before you get into the discussions.    Negative DSR / TRFM   OliverNChalk begins a discussion and argues in favor of negative rates.   Combined with the MIP20 proposal from Lev.   And other options in terms of influencing negative rates, which has been good to see.     Signal Requests 12:03   Increase duration of governance security module? - Failed to Pass  A couple of weeks ago, Joshua_Pritikin asked whether we should increase the Governance Security Module delay to 24 hours to make it easier to defend against governance attacks. That has failed.    Concerns Surrounding the TUSD Collateral Type - Moving On-chain   Lucas Manuel from the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts team asks how governance wishes to move forward with the TUSD collateral type considering the recent contract upgrades.   Adjusting the TUSD debt ceiling to zero was the chosen path.   The Smart Contract Team thinks that\u2019s probably a wise call.     Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium - Moving On-chain   Prompted by Andy.   I just realized it was left out of Governance at a Glance forum thread.     Adjust the ZRX and KNC Risk Premiums - Continuing  Monet-supply proposes decreasing the risk premiums for KNC and/or ZRX.    Lower the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio and Risk Premium - New   @hexonaut asks if Maker governance should increase the USDC-A liquidation Ratio and/or Risk Premium to help fix the recent peg deviation.    Help Wanted 13:26   Wanted: Governance Help   LongForWisdom asks for applicants to help out with some of the necessary governance work.   Ironically I decided to post this one day before I realized that Rich was leaving, so it becomes more important now that I have found out.   If you want to get involved more in governance, please drop me a line.     MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 14:17 Title Slide1388\u00d7646 257 KB This Week&#39;s Activity1402\u00d7708 177 KB   Initially, there were seven proposals. Two got rejected from the Governance Poll.   The Governance Poll did pass unanimously, which is great to see.   Next Week&#39;s Activity1403\u00d7744 118 KB   As a reminder, if the vote doesn\u2019t pass within four days, the proposals be rejected. So, it is important to vote when the MIPs Executive does go out as soon as possible to make sure the proposals we want to effectively become law or technical implementations to get added to the Protocol and Governance.   Next Thursday is the final meeting of July\u2019s Governance cycle, where we\u2019ll do a review of what happened throughout the month. We\u2019ll look at what worked, what didn\u2019t, and we can consider specific amendments to certain processes.   Other News1379\u00d7720 128 KB   MANA could be added to the Protocol over the next week or two, depending on the time the vote passes.   LEND: There are some considerations to keep in mind that the domain teams have been thinking about with respect to the token upgrade from LEND to AAVE, which will be happening towards the end of the summer.   The eleven Collateral Onboarding Greenlight polls are live, so go ahead and vote to whatever you feel are great opportunities for Maker to consider.   As we know, MIP17 was rejected from the Governance cycle this month. Whether that was because it wasn\u2019t completely supported with answering questions, or maybe it wasn\u2019t the perfect solution for fulfilling Maker\u2019s needs. I want to hold a working group next Tuesday about how we can improve and modify this proposal. Some considerations could be to use it to modify debt ceiling adjustments, rather than pairing both the DC and risk premium adjustments. But I want to take this time to work with the community on really improving this proposal so that we can get a solution in place for quicker adjustments of specific parameters that the Maker protocol considers. I\u2019ll post those details in the forums and in rocket chat.   If there is a proposal that has been rejected from the Governance cycle and you are the author or you really support it, consider holding a call or even doing a forum thread on how we can improve the proposal, because the onus is always on the author to get it proposed. By holding these working groups, you can really work with people in the community that have a stake in that type of expertise. So, I just wanted to remind everyone that it is on the author, and they should take the initiative, and if the authors don\u2019t want to do that, they can definitely transition their ownership of the proposal over to someone who would like to lead it going forward.   Other News 21394\u00d7733 94.5 KB   TUSD: If that passes, it will proceed to a weekly executive on the following Friday.   PSM Vote: Sam MacPherson on chat   PSM did not pass   50.04% against     Charles St-Louis: I checked five minutes ago, thanks for that correction.   Join the community907\u00d7519 100 KB LongForWisdom Governance Poll Review 20:50   As Charles said, the poll passed 18 thousand Maker in favor and zero against. I don\u2019t see any reason to prevent that from continuing to the executive. We will continue with the executive on Monday, according to the MIPs process.   Sam just informed us that the PSM poll did not pass. It ended 50.04% against, which is perhaps the closest poll we\u2019ve had so far.  Charles St-Louis: thanks for that correction.    Yes, it was very split. We will talk about it tomorrow, hopefully.   Smart Contracts Wil Barnes LEND Token Upgrade 22:19   Since there will be some changes and upgrades in the LEND token, Aave has asked us to postpone consideration for a later MIP Cycle, so we\u2019re going to postpone, possibly to September. We will reassess the token at a later date.   Mariano: Much like Maker did a few years ago; we had an old MKR token that was migrated. Aave is going to be doing the same. They will be migrating LEND to AAVE tokens. I think 1 LEND is going to be 100 AAVE tokens. It will be optional, but we expect most people to upgrade, as AAVE will be used for Aavenomics and probably some other things. So it\u2019s easy to wait and onboard AAVE instead of putting LEND now to migrate it in a month or so. We\u2019re in contact with the Aave team, and they will give us access to the token contract early so we can start checking it as soon as possible, and then we do the actual AAVE onboarding.   Oracles Nik Kunkel About Rich Brown 25:09  I don\u2019t know if you guys know this, but for those that have not been in Maker Governance for a long time time, this used to be a bunch of hangover 20-year-olds showing up on a Sunday morning. And Rich Brown is really the reason that we\u2019re here today and have this formalized governance process that is community-driven. This did not happen organically. It was very much orchestrated by the master Rich Brown. If you guys want to ping Rich after this meeting, I\u2019m sure it will make him uncomfortable, just to thank him for how much he has done for the community. Fun fact about Rich: he comes from a long line of Maker people that have basically hired themselves. There was never a job posting about needing a Rich. Rich started hanging around in the RocketChat a bit too much for a normal person and started to do stuff. And eventually, we started needing him to keep doing stuff. I respect a lot the Maker guys that came in this way. I\u2019ll stop making Rich blush now.  Gitcoin 27:19 The Issue  We\u2019ve had a slight issue with Gitcoin. It was voted as a light feed. They provisioned the VPS that was running the oracle feed with way too little source space. They had 8 Gb of storage, and the OS was taking 7.7 Gb. So it quickly blew up. They managed to lock themselves out. They couldn\u2019t get into the box because they screwed up the partition so badly. This, in combination with the fact that they never backed up their keys, means that the entire key that they were using to sign their oracle prices went up in smoke.  The Solution  We need to do a new executive vote to swap their old key for the new key. In the Gitcoin light feed application forum post, the founder of Gitcoin has submitted a signed message with his new key, saying that he wants to swap the key. I\u2019ve talked to Kevin, and we have already set up the new feed on much better hardware producing the VPS. He\u2019s already been signing messages for the past week and a half with the new key, and everything looks stable. It\u2019s a matter of basically lifting the new key and removing the old key. It\u2019s quite a simple swap to make.  Scaling Processes   We\u2019ll remind all the feeds to exercise proper key management. I thought this went without saying, but we still need to remind people.   Kevin is a great guy. No harm, no foul. These situations come up, so it\u2019s important to have smooth processes for dealing with them.   Argent 30:03  The Argent proposal just passed this morning, so we will be helping them set up over the next week or so, so expect an executive vote within two weeks to vote them in on-chain as well.  Governance Monet_Supply Vault Compensation Plan 31:18 Poll Failed  The poll last week failed by about 25,000 to 17,000, with 33 voters. Participation was down over half based on the amount of MKR voting as independent voters. I think the original poll back in April was about 62,000 Yes to 33,000 No. So participation was definitely way down.  Feedback Received   Over the past week, we\u2019ve got a little bit of feedback in the forums. Potential things that might get more support for the poll going forward. We have heard:   Too many steps and votes.   Too much governance overhead, making it less appealing to MKR voters. Simpler and fewer steps might be good.   Not having clarity at the very beginning about potential costs, which would have been made clear later in the process, had it been approved\u2014still a fair concern.   Not enough time or awareness built about the vote. More people to get more publicity on it. Possibly a longer voting period: maybe a couple of weeks instead of a couple of days. MakerMan suggested waiting until you get enough quorum of MKR before closing it. Not sure if technically possible, just an idea.   Not enough clarity between MakerDAO and Maker Foundation, and who would be responsible and where the money would and should be coming from.     That was most of the feedback. My take on that is, \u201cHow much overlap is there between the people providing feedback and the people voting no?\u201d You can\u2019t be sure, but my guess is, \u201cnot that high.\u201d So some of these ideas might be speculative about what would make it more appealing for MKR voters.   Next Steps   The working group, including myself, will have to discuss during the weekend and give at least some sort of status update early next week.   Anyone else that continues to have feedback, please go ahead and share in the Vault Compensation forum thread or the Vault Compensation Update forum thread.   LongForWisdom PSM Update  PSM Discussion - Forum Thread  PSM Parameters Vote Postponed 35:18   I\u2019ll start with a brief clarifying statement about how the Peg Stabilization Module(PSM) is going to work now, considering the statement from the Foundation. I previously stated that we would have another vote next week about the PSM parameters and that they would be included in the executive vote either the week or two after. Seeing that there\u2019s no one developing it, that\u2019s probably not going to happen. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to vote on the parameters when any community implementation probably isn\u2019t going to be ready within a reasonable time. So if we vote on parameters now, we could find that the market has changed later.   In addition to all this, the Governance Poll failed.   So we don\u2019t have any further on-chain votes on the PSM for the time being.   The Future of PSM on the Community 36:21   That said, if the community does want to pursue it separately from the Foundation, there are avenues we can start to work on. Any implementation would probably need to go through the MIP process at this point.   A good start might be a Declaration of Intent, through MIP13. I\u2019m trying to confirm whether MKR holders want the PSM, which may be a little bit difficult considering the recent vote. That would be the place to try and resolve the blockers and move forward.   Risk LongForWisdom Peg Stability Discussion Lowering the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio 38:12   Sam MacPherson: With the poll that I put out yesterday, I\u2019m thinking maybe we should lower the USDC-A liquidation ratio to try to get more collateral moving through that venue to mint more Dai. To me, it seems like all the people on these farming behaviors want to stay in stablecoins. Looking at COMP, for example, they want Dai for COMP. There are two mechanisms that make them want to stay in stablecoins. There\u2019s buying Dai on the market, and there\u2019s minting Dai through USDC. We should make USDC-A as attractive as possible so that we prevent this market buying behavior. Please respond in that thread I made.   Matthew Rabinowitz: I definitely agree. Going down the path you mentioned makes sense. Getting USDC as a mechanism to have market makers arbitrage in that space will help adjust the peg back down. The real solution is a market-driven solution.   YFI Farming Unwinding 40:00  Cyrus Younessi: Most people generally agree that we need to increase the supply right now. I want everyone to understand that everyone understands that the current demand is almost certainly likely going to alleviate by the end of this weekend. A big source of the recent surge has been the YFI farming, which has generated extreme demand for Dai. I think that\u2019s scheduled to stop either Saturday or Sunday. I think that some 100 million Dai is sitting in that contract. When that unwinds, I\u2019m expecting to see a lot of that Dai return back to where it came from. We\u2019ve seen the Compound utilization ratio increase significantly. A somewhat more conservative option would be to wait for a few days to see how that unwind looks. Before the YFI farming, the Dai peg wasn\u2019t great, but it was at the very least under 1.01. I just want to caution from some sort of extreme overreaction when in just a few days, we should see some lightening up of the pressure anyway. This is just a best guess on my part.  USDC Usage and Collateralization Ratio 41:55   Matthew Rabinowitz: We also haven\u2019t hit the cap on the total amount of usage on USDC-A. As of right now, it\u2019s some 28 million out of a debt ceiling of 80 million. So there\u2019s still plenty of utilization capable on that area, which we can incentivize by lowering that collateralization ratio. We just need to be mindful that it creates an exponential effect on how much leverage you can get out of it. I don\u2019t even remember right now what the collateralization ratio is, but I know there were discussions to pull it down to 110%, or even lower. It\u2019s a good issue; it magnifies the benefits for it, we just need to be mindful, because we take on more risk when we allow higher more leverage.   Sam MacPherson: Even going down to 110% may have a fairly large effect, those who are looking to move into Dai through USDC, paying a 1 or 2 cent premium is not that much when looking at these yields, which are like 1,000% sometimes. Having to lock up 20% extra collateral as opposed to just buying it on the market, may not seem like a very attractive option at this point. Going down to 110% or 105% may help a lot to alleviate upward pressure.   Impact of the Foundation Announcement on the PSM 43:25   Matthew Light: It seems that the Dai peg slipping seems to coincide with the post yesterday about the PSM being abandoned by the Foundation.   Sam MacPherson: It\u2019s maybe coincidental. We can effectively get the PSM at least in one direction by lowering the collateral ratio on USDC-A. If we went to 101%, it would be pretty close to being similar to what the PSM could do at this stage.   Matthew Light: It\u2019s worth the try.   The Importance of the Peg 44:36  Matthew Light: When the peg goes this high, it produces the desire of people to borrow in Dai, because they\u2019re facing issues. If they borrow 30,000 Dai and the peg slips a couple of points, they may lose thousands of dollars pretty quickly. The peg not being in control really does affect demand for borrowing Dai, especially the demand for borrowing Dai to bet on assets.  Yield Farming and the Peg 45:18   Matthew Light: The yield farming doesn\u2019t affect the peg very much, what affects it, is when Dai is used to buy assets, like Ether, on the market. That brings the peg down. Yield Farming doesn\u2019t have that feedback loop.   LongForWisdom: It\u2019s worth noting that if people buy Dai to use in Yield Farming, then it does have that effect. It\u2019s not entirely separated, I would say.   Matthew Light: Yes. I don\u2019t think people are buying Dai. For the most part, I think that they\u2019re mostly borrowing it.   Sam MacPherson: For farming, there are two points. Buying ETH will have a negative pressure on the peg, to go down. But it\u2019s also effective to prevent upward pressure from market buys to use for this farming. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s clear that people aren\u2019t market buying to get into Dai for this farming.   Vishesh: There are two important clarifications. Some people buy Dai and place it in a pool, it 100% drives the peg up. And even if they\u2019re not specifically purchasing Dai, if they\u2019re taking Dai that otherwise would have been sold, and dumping it into this Farming Yield platforms, it\u2019s also drying up the liquidity and driving the price up. That\u2019s pretty clear.   ",

A few days ago, a lot of the YFI Farming out there and other types of yield that have emerged, precipitated a further acceleration to jumping straight up 20 million, more or less overnight.   That brings the total Dai from ETH-A supply up to 184 million.    Compoud Dashboard1012\u00d7721 140 KB   Compound has dropped to a net 27 or so million Dai being supplied there.

That\u2019s important to keep in mind.   I\u2019m not saying that overnight it\u2019s going to go back to 1.00, but it may level back to 1.01 - 1.02. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.

Chasing Yield 54:42   As these yields shift, so too does the money.   No one is married to the platforms where they dump Dai right now. They chase the most attractive yield short term.   These could be very impermanent trends.   The question of how much this upward pressure will sustain is the question of how much these yields will sustain.   A huge chunk of Dai is being minted to go into these platforms but, more importantly, very little Dai is minted and being sold on the open market. That\u2019s where the elevated price pressure comes from. There are questions:   How long will the price pressure last?   What does the Maker Community want to do about current Dai liquidity?   How much of an impact will that have on the peg?     The third question is nested within the second because the amount of price impact that increases market liquidity for Dai would have on the peg is primarily a function of how much people are willing to relinquish that Dai and sell it in order to arb the current profit.   The problem right now is that a 3% or 4% haircut is something that people are willing to take in the short term to get access to 600% yields on some of these platforms.   Those yields are likely to dry up very soon, as Cyrus mentioned. Will the next yield come up? Probably not to that same extent.  Matthew Light: Looks like the YFI will dry up on Saturday or Sunday. But mStable is going to have a yield of maybe 100%.     Why Dai 57:43   Vishesh: YFI is a slightly outsized yield right now compared to the others available. So it\u2019s an extra-large sink, a bit atypical. But it does appear to be continuing a trend that has kicked-off with the COMP Farming activities available. There are questions about why, though. Why Dai? Why Dai for these ventures.   At the end of the day, Dai is visible, interoperable, integrated into a lot of these platforms, but it\u2019s also an asset with a comparatively small volume and a small supply. I\u2019ve spoken before about how often Dai carries a premium with it. How it innately has access to yields outside of this Farming stuff. It\u2019s basically a call option on illiquidity, for example, when liquidations happen. People hold in the hopes of making a profit in those times as well.   There are a lot of reasons why Dai has sustained an elevated premium and why it\u2019s worth more than holding one USDC lately. You throw Farming on top of that, and it only exacerbates the premium. If Dai was as proliferated and had as large of supply as USDC it probably wouldn\u2019t be as attractive as a target for some of these Farming opportunities.   All that, coupled with the fact that Dai has been a well-used asset with very decent transaction volumes for its supply.   It\u2019s a potentially sustained trend that farming opportunities will exist around Dai even though what\u2019s currently happening this week is atypical.    makervaults.descipher.io1352\u00d7511 106 KB    Let\u2019s look at the impact that this has had on the underlying collateral supply.   We\u2019re talking a lot about monetary policy, price, premiums, and usage. Also, consider the underlying risk that are being underwritten by MKR holders and the system. Interestingly, in the last week, the ETH CR has gone up. Very simply put, ETH price also went up, so that\u2019s primarily a function of just the ETH price.   Vaults have also lowered their CR in that same time frame. It\u2019s important to consider that what goes up comes down. What we\u2019ve seen in the past, is that when ETH rises suddenly, there\u2019s a tendency to come back down as well. In the elevated ETH price, we\u2019ve seen increased amounts of Dai living at this lower CR.    ETH Dai Projected Liquidations1348\u00d7398 56.1 KB    That means that there could be some liquidations. That\u2019s a risk to be aware of.   At $220 ETH, you\u2019d have 12 million Dai being liquidated.   At $150 ETH, you would have 92 million being liquidated.   Those are big jumps. Although, yes, only a small amount is at risk for more realistic price drops.   $150 dollar price is not completely out of reason for ETH. It\u2019s important to consider that on a percentage basis, it\u2019s not out of pattern, but in nominal terms, that is huge.   What would happen is there were a price drop and massive liquidation events to Dai? Given the liquidity problems right now, and given just the degree of Dai that\u2019s locked up in farming, at the moment, that could be a potential problem.    WBTC Dai Projected Liquidations1384\u00d7378 46.7 KB   For WBTC, If there was a small disruption in the price to WBTC there would be about 10 million liquidated.   BAT Dai collateralization ratio1416\u00d7664 99 KB   BAT is relatively low risk since it\u2019s well collateralized.   Discussion on the Peg  Why is Dai attractive on COMP Farming 1:05:00  Sam MacPherson: I want to make a point on why COMP farming is Dai specific. It comes entirely from the interest rate curve set by Compound Governance. They have very very low-interest rate up until 90%, and then there\u2019s a discontinuous kink at that point. It\u2019s because of that structure that Dai is the most attractive. They can totally change that if they want.   Current Gas Prices and Arbitrage 1:05:58  Christopher Mooney: It remains to be seen whether this will or won\u2019t have an impact on the Dai peg. If you already have a vault, and your collateral is already locked, and you want to generate Dai against it, the \u201cslow price\u201d is right now over 100 Gwei. I just got a price quote of about 10,50 dollars, just to generate Dai, which means that you need to generate at a reasonable volume to start to approach a good arbitrage. If you do the full cycle; lock collateral, generate Dai, sell it in the market, buy Dai back, and pay your vault down \u2014 for an entire tier of retail arbitrageurs, it may mean that it\u2019s not economical at 1%, 2%, or 3% above peg. Nik brought up a good point that most of the arbitrage is probably happening by whales. So once you hit a certain volume of Dai, the gas price becomes irrelevant.   Act or Wait 1:08:10  Cyrus Younessi: Vishesh, that was a great summary of what\u2019s going on. For me, I\u2019m waiting for Governance to see how aggressive they want to be with any changes, such as the Liquidation Ratio or if they want to wait for a few days to see how the unwind of the YFI Farming happens. I also want to highlight that just in the past day, we\u2019ve seen a lot of Dai being generated, especially from the recent Debt Ceiling increase. It\u2019s not really as if Dai supply is slowing down or anything. I don\u2019t have a strong view one way or another, but I do think that some sort of informal consensus could be really useful at this point.   Seeking Signal Thread 1:09:15   Sam MacPherson: With regards to the signaling thread I\u2019ve put up, I\u2019ve delayed the vote until next Wednesday. So we can wait and see what happens on Saturday.   Christopher Mooney: Do we have any executive votes going out on Friday right now?   LongForWisdom: We do. We have the Gitcoin thing that Nik mentioned and possibly something else.   Mariano Conti: There are a couple of things regarding Oracles, but did anything pass regarding risk premiums, base rates, or anything like that?   LongForWisdom: I\u2019ll double-check.    Taking Action in the Executive Vote 1:10:19   Christopher Mooney: If there isn\u2019t too much competition on this week\u2019s executive vote, we may want to consider creating a really quick ad-hoc bundle set. Ultimately Maker Governance gets to decide whether or not they want it. We\u2019d be able to possibly do the USDC CR. Maybe BAT DC. It would break our normal flow, but we\u2019re at a 1.03 Dai price right now.   LongForWisdom: That\u2019s a good point for me to go over how it would happen again. In order to do something outside of the governance cycle, we need to, in some way, say that this is an emergency. Currently, this could happen from Cyrus or a Risk Team, saying that they think it\u2019s an emergency. Or it could happen if there\u2019s a poll in the forum getting a majority saying that there\u2019s an emergency and we want to do these things. Given that all the things we\u2019re discussing are stuff we\u2019ve done before, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to make it more than 50%. If someone wants to see emergency action in some form, they need to create a signal request forum poll and get people to agree that we need an emergency action for this.   Christopher Mooney: How detailed does it need to be?   LongForWisdom: I would prefer it if it said what we wanted to do as an emergency measure. But we have had more general ones in the past that just declare an emergency situation and the will to do things generally. So it could be flexible, but I would much prefer it if there was a specific proposal.     Sam MacPherson: With regards to the signal thread, there does seem to be the vast majority of people wanting to lower the LR of USDC-A to some number, if that helps. Cyrus would need to make that call if it\u2019s an emergency, though.   LongForWisdom: I think that Cyrus\u2019s point is that he would take leadership from the community in this case. It\u2019s a reasonable assumption to create a poll.    This Spike Might Not be a Trend 1:13:14  Vishesh: This COMP Farming Yield has existed, and in the last few days, we\u2019ve seen an extra elevation of the price. So we have to ask ourselves what\u2019s changed in that timeframe. It\u2019s primarily this YFI Farming Activity. That has a defined expiration day on it. Of course, there are others that will exist after that, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be at the same rate. It seems like there\u2019s a strong case for waiting to see what happens in a few days. I\u2019m not telling people how they should choose to respond to that. But in terms of what trends are likely to continue, there\u2019s reasonable doubt whether that\u2019s actually a long-term trend. It hasn\u2019t even piped its way into the 24-hour moving price yet. Acting on that in terms of emergency action is questionable. But whether that\u2019s actually the current sustained trend, that doesn\u2019t appear to be clear right now.   Fixing the Peg 1:14:39   Matthew Light: It\u2019s been five months since the peg went above 1 dollar. Whatever has happened, we haven\u2019t been below since then.   Vishesh: Yes. But is that what we\u2019re talking about solving right now? We\u2019re mixing threads there. The current question was about the 1.03 / 1.04 price, which has not been the case for six months.   Sam MacPherson: I\u2019m looking at lowering the liquidation ratio as a general mechanism to alleviate this past few months\u2019 COMP Farming altogether.   Matthew Light: I think that just having the peg at 1.03 and going up constitutes a crisis of trust in the peg, going down and the potential of global settlement. People want to borrow Dai, confident that they can pay it back at the rate of 1 dollar instead of 1.10.   Matthew Rabinowitz: Having the LR lower and having something that\u2019s a hard number to trade-off will directly help that.    Structuring the Question 1:16:22  Vishesh: Just to keep the questions clear. One was the sustained peg elevation, what to do about it. The second one was the 1.03~1.04 price, is that an emergency? My point about the second question was that it\u2019s yet to even be sustained for 24 hours. There\u2019s a question there as to whether that is what the peg is at, or whether this is a short term spike.   Adding Enough Diverse Collateral 1:17:00   Matthew Rabinowitz: It\u2019s almost like a general question of when the price is volatile like we had earlier in March, there\u2019s an implicit bias that the fundamental collateral is ETH, and you borrow against it, if you\u2019re concerned that the price might drop precipitously, you just tend not to borrow as much as you would. There\u2019s a natural bias to be slightly above one until we add enough collateral that it creates a diverse portfolio that will pull it down.   Vishesh: I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the collateral portfolio that necessarily dictates that. I wanted to clarify that it\u2019s not necessarily about the collateral. In the long term, there\u2019s this potential premium that exists due to the usage of Dai. If we hearken back to last year, we were having the flip conversation about Dai when it was below the peg. The concern there is that Dai was being used much more for leverage than for actual transactions. At that time, the conversation was that too many people were dumping Dai into the market to sell it and rewrap for leverage. There\u2019s now a different way to get yield, which involves purchasing Dai instead of selling it. It\u2019s kind of a mirror problem of what was happening at that time.    Negative Cost of Capital 1:18:54   Matthew Rabinowitz: 100% agree. My point is that now we have hit a cost of capital at zero, and we don\u2019t want to go lower than that.   Matthew Light: There\u2019s a negative cost of capital right now. We\u2019re in a negative interest rate market on Ethereum. That\u2019s a big part of the problem. I can borrow money and get paid to borrow money from Compound, and we\u2019re getting ready to see that from Aave and these other protocols.    Is Minting More Dai the Solution 1:19:34   Vishesh: It seems the interest is to talk about the long term issue. There\u2019s a question of, \u201care you actually going to do anything by minting more supply?\u201d Are people willing to come and say, \u201cI will take Dai, eat the cost, I will sell it, and I will arbitrage that profit.\u201d I don\u2019t think SF has any impact on the decision-making process much as they weren\u2019t back then. On a nominal basis, what\u2019s the difference between a 300% yield and a 296% yield? Right now, the SFs are very low. There\u2019s very little cost associated with minting Dai from Maker right now. And there\u2019s plenty of room in the DC. Why are people not doing that? That\u2019s one set of questions around user behavior. The other thing is, \u201cwhat is the impact of those actions?\u201d If that Dai is not making its way to the open market, it\u2019s being minted for other things, I get the idea that it\u2019s soaking a little bit of demand, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not having a short-term price impact. That\u2019s what you\u2019re targeting right now. There\u2019s a bigger thread here that I want to bring up in terms of the forest from the trees. Getting more supply minted as a method of solving the peg may be coming at a square peg with a circle thinking. There\u2019s maybe a different conversation to be had around how are we actually solving the peg problem.   Sam MacPherson: I respectfully disagree with that. You are right that the ideal scenario is people minting Dai and selling it. It\u2019s also beneficial to prevent people from buying Dai to put it into these farming opportunities. I\u2019d rather them mint it. In that sense, increasing the supply does help to prevent the peg from shooting up more than it needs to.    Capital Efficiency 1:22:10   Vishesh: There\u2019s a question of capital efficiency there. I\u2019m not sure that it will ever be more capital-efficient to mint Dai than it will be to just purchase it. There\u2019s a price premium, and there\u2019s the potential loss, but there\u2019s also capital efficiency. If you\u2019re going to mint Dai from ETH, for example, the CR is going to determine whether or not you engage in that minting behavior in order to chase that yield.   Sam MacPherson: I completely agree, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m advocating to lower the liquidation ratio on USDC.    Capital Efficiency and Lowering the Liquidation Ratio on USDC 1:23:20   Vishesh: The liquidation ratio for USDC is comparatively pretty low right now versus some other things that exist in the space, and certainly compared to ETH. So there\u2019s a question of how low do you want to go. What is your goal? What is your role in this market ecosystem in terms of providing this liquidity to the market, and what\u2019s your goal in terms of Dai peg management, MKR holders managing system risk, etc.? You\u2019re ratcheting up the amount of risk that the system is underwriting there.   Matthew Rabinowitz: The LR wouldn\u2019t change the underlying risk. It\u2019s the DC. What surprises me is that the utilization ratio of USDC is not already at 100% right now.   Vishesh: My point is that since it\u2019s not even at 100%, I\u2019m not sure that dropping that LR to anything other than even 99% would do anything or force it to be capped out. It\u2019s a fundamental question, not a percentage question. Is it ever fundamentally more efficient to lock up collateral in the platform to mint that asset and then go dump it somewhere for a short term yield versus getting 1:1 for your capital and buying it on the open market?   Sam MacPherson: I\u2019m trying to approach that 1:1 by lowering the liquidation ratio down to 101% or 105%. As we approach it, buying it on the market would be less attractive, because you can pretty much mint it 1:1.    Risk and Maker Making 1:25:37  Vishesh: That\u2019s where you bump up against what\u2019s the goal. I think it\u2019s fundamentally wrong to say that that does not increase risk. It does. If you assume there\u2019s zero risk, then there\u2019s zero risk. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to assume there\u2019s zero risk. That\u2019s a separate point there. I\u2019m just trying to encourage the focus of the discussion so that we\u2019re not necessarily chasing how do we get the most Dai minted versus trying to more directly tackle the problem. How do you facilitate people\u2019s market-making Dai right now?   Increasing Total Supply to Lower the Peg 1:26:44   Matthew Rabinowitz: If there\u2019s more Dai outstanding, the overall yield drops, whether it\u2019s dydx or Compound, assuming the quantity of borrowing doesn\u2019t change. If there\u2019s more supply, the yield goes down.   Vishesh: It\u2019s also shifting a bit from COMP Farming to other forms of yield. What impacts those yields? Does this solution solve that next thing? Emergency action versus long-term solution, I think we\u2019re discussing long-term solution here. As far as emergency action goes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re discussing anything that would make the peg to change in the next two days.    Potential Factors for the Spike 1:28:15   Matthew Light: I think that the Foundation dropping the PSM has had psychological impacts on the peg. I think we saw a change in the price after that happened.   Christopher Mooney: There\u2019s a chance that there\u2019s a correlation with the Binance announcement today. It looks like it spiked up to 1.14 at one point. When we see Dai hits new markets, when people don\u2019t know what it is, we have seen occasions where people trade Dai like if it\u2019s some speculative asset, and they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a stablecoin. There\u2019s a possibility that we do have some traders on Binance thinking that. Just adding another possible correlation.    The Opportunity Costs of Arbitraging the Peg 1:29:24   Vishesh: The problem right now is that no one is arbitraging the peg because there\u2019s a ridiculously outsized yield available from doing other things with your capital. That\u2019s the core problem. How are we addressing that problem?   Matthew Light: I agree. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve said about negative real interest rates. You basically have people paying you to borrow money.   Vishesh: I try not to comment too often on the more speculative components of what\u2019s going on. My goal is to make sure that the community is considering all the possible solutions as well as the problem. Making sure that we\u2019re not chasing a red herring and tackling the core problem, which is that no one is arbitraging the peg. What I\u2019m missing from the whole thread is the actual solution to facilitating more arbitrage behavior of the peg.    Potential Scenarios 1:31:05   Matthew Light: At some point, it may be necessary for the Protocol to arbitrage the peg directly. Let\u2019s look at scenarios that could happen. The peg keeps going up, and at some point, the options are: Emergency Shutdown, or buying ETH on the market with newly created Dai to make the peg go down, or maybe there are some other options.   Matthew Rabinowitz: I think you will also find a scenario where just like an Algo trading in the stock market made a ton of money, which ultimately introduced a ton of market participants that made more money, up to a point where they put themselves out of business. So the yield COMP Farming, while interesting, at some point it will go naturally go away because of the competition that it creates. That capital will ultimately circle back to things it can do, like people who are just happy making 30% per month doing a yield arbitrage against the peg.   LongForWisdom: I agree that long term it will probably go away. But we\u2019re dealing with a medium-term issue.   Matthew Light: Why would Compound, for example, stop issuing COMP tokens?   LongForWisdom: Because the COMP token holders are not going to be happily diluting themselves forever. Maybe they are to some extent.    Cost of Capital 1:33:03   Joe Quintillian: I would like to mention that the allocation of capital that has gone to yield farming and has a lot of people\u2019s money tied. If they go and arbitrage the peg like this, they get less return on capital. We have a significant move in terms of Binance listing Dai, YFI, a whole bunch of things. At some point, 1.03, 1.04, it gets tempting for people who were Yield Farming to lever up a little further to hit down the peg.   Vishesh: It seems like half the Dai out there is locked up specifically the YFI farming activity right now. That\u2019s not counting what\u2019s locked up in COMP right now. So, yes, 100%, that\u2019s what the numbers are showing. All the Dai capital out there is allocated to this farming behavior. It\u2019s not being used for arbitrage, so the peg movement has been elevated, and it\u2019s made it easier for upward price pressure to take hold. That\u2019s 100% what\u2019s going on.    Dai Locked Up in Yield Farming 1:34:46   Matthew Rabinowitz: How much money is actually in aggregate or moving around on a daily basis as a part of this COMP Farming?   Vishesh: In COMP there is a net 27 or so million locked. I think there\u2019s another 100 million in YFI.   Matthew Rabinowitz: I\u2019m talking about including all the daily trade volume from Curve and Balancer. It feels horrible that the peg has drifted from 1.01 to 1.03 now, but we might also take into consideration that that maybe 700 million Dai of transactional volume a day that\u2019s causing the Dai peg to move by 0.01. That might be a reflective point about how stable the system is, even with how much capacity is moving around in it.   Vishesh: It\u2019s important to keep perspective. There\u2019s over 100 million Dai in the YFI pool across Balancer and Curve. The fact that that did not cause a larger price movement is important to consider as well. At what price would you buy Dai to lock it up? You would get 600% yield annually, but over the next few days that you have access to that. There\u2019s a calculus there, what degree of profitability justifies that behavior. That crazy yield is short term. There will be others yields, but lesser after this dries itself up. And yes, there\u2019s 100% long-term question that needs to be tackled about what to do about the fact that Dai has sustained an elevated price, on average.    Outro  LongForWisdom  Closing Comments 1:37:30   I would like to thank everyone for coming and hope to see you again at the next meeting. If you do want to see the action happen on the peg or something else, the forum is the place to go.   As I have mentioned, if you want to see emergency action, there needs to be a signal thread requesting that specifically.   Thank you again, and see you all soon.

Afterward, we will have Vishesh do some brief coverage on the Dai peg and other metrics. The theme of the next few Governance calls will be purely around migration. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Rune Christensen Presentation 01:29   As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re ready to launch MCD on November 18th. This presentation is meant to help internalize what that means from a governance perspective. What MCD means for DeFi in general, and the features it opens up for Maker that we\u2019ve always wanted to have.  pIVQtgw.jpg1562\u00d7878 124 KB    66uacJb.jpg1566\u00d7881 143 KB   The first thing we should do is take a step back and remember what the point is of what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re creating a better economic system that can be a more resilient base layer for those who use it. Maker is built to benefit all the stakeholders and users of its ecosystem.  z9TY85B.jpg1566\u00d7881 129 KB   What I want to highlight is that there are things like InstaDapp that take a bunch of DeFi protocols and put them together on one front-end which provides tremendous value for users because you are unlocking the synergy in an easy to use form. The Foundation is relaunching Oasis with the same approach of bundling all these services into our own branded front-ends. The hardest part of the next phase is scaling Dai to Billions in supply.  YvTxid9.jpg1562\u00d7879 122 KB   Composability is the first big value unlock. The next huge thing is scaling the MakerDAO collateral portfolio. We believe MakerDAO needs real-world assets to scale the DeFi economy. We will be using blockchain to upgrade the legacy financial system.  hs0iXR2.jpg1560\u00d7876 167 KB   It\u2019s important to talk about regulation. If we want to have real-world assets in Maker we need to understand how regulation applies. The huge question is around the need for recourse in liquidations and how to enforce legal claims on the underlying assets of security tokens. Approaching regulators with the strategy of diversification is very important. This helps us diversify our jurisdictional and regulatory risk.  a4tVHsa.jpg1561\u00d7878 103 KB   Synthetic assets are a way we can scale the supply side to meet the various kinds of demand there are for synthetic assets beside Dai, like EURDai, YENDai, and more. Creating Synetic assets involves using the same codebase of MCD, so there is no technical challenge to creating these. Having a central synthetic asset, like gold, for example, can include several on-chain gold solutions as collateral types to help centralize liquidity of the total on-chain gold market. A similar strategy can be used for other types of assets as well. It would create a less risky exposure to the underlying asset type.  DEgLsh9.jpg1563\u00d7880 88.6 KB   This is a low-res version of the new Dai logo.  Discussion 23:30    23:40: LFW: Multiple Synthetic assets sounds like a terrifying amount of governance. Adding in multiple things on top of MCD sounds like it will be difficult.  Rich: Hot topic of governance, we\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations about that at Devcon. Governance, DAO\u2019s, how do we manage what we\u2019ve built, etc. There isn\u2019t a point to point roadmap of how to do this specifically. I am confident that we will be able to iterate and accommodate the additional complexity for the new MCD. I am confident we\u2019ll be able to handle it even if it is intimidating. Rune: Obviously, what it requires is the risk teams and other teams that MKR holders delegate responsibility to. It\u2019s complicated, and no single member will be able to understand every piece and adjust based on that. The broad governance of all the MKR holders and all the participants will matter the most; proper sanity checks on what the risk teams come out with. There will be times where something falls through. We don\u2019t try to engineer against risk; we try to be realistic about what happens. Rich: As the process matures, we will keep bringing in new teams. As empowered actors are released in the ecosystem, more teams of dedicated individuals will take on separate aspects of the ecosystem.    28:07: Akiva: Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to have non-US based collateral as a plan for the collateral portfolio diversification? e.g., Russia as a good place to bring on collateral.  Rich: As a regulatory arbitrage? Akiva: The concern is that the US could use allies to seize collateral unfairly. So a way to protect against that. Rune: Initially, I think what we should hold onto is the stability provided by the rule of law. Focusing on diversification across the most influential legal jurisdictions will help us manage geopolitical and regulatory risk. Countries with a strong track record on standards of law and property rights are less of a risk. China and Russia come to mind as  geopolitical hedges. You can imagine a scenario where the US was an antagonizer for cracking down on collateral; you could see that China might support that collateral. It\u2019s a valid point of a top-level direction that Maker should pursue. The riskier turn is the ease of which a government could crack down on property rights. The US core economy functions on private economies of property rights and private business. Every corporation acting as a mini-government is fundamental for the economy to even work at all. So it\u2019s expensive for the country to start causing doubts about the rule of law. Whereas China and Russia are based around state-owned enterprises. So non-geopolitically-aligned places are unicorns worth looking at. Like Singapore, for example. In general, we always want to diversify.    37:15: Renat: What may be the possible steps, milestones, and prerequisites for MCD to launch a stablecoin that tracks something other than the US Dollar, like the Argentinean Peso?  Rune: Argentineans don\u2019t want anything to do with their own peso. That is actually why Dai is seeing an explosion of use in Argentina. However, it may be as simple as deploying the same technology stack of MCD to efficiently facilitate new synthetic assets, Peso, or anything that has demand.    43:08: Rich: When do you think Synthetic assets will be a real topic of conversation for launch?  Rune: I can\u2019t answer that. From the tech, we are very close to being able to do that. I imagine the big blocker is really Governance. There will be collateral types that will have the same risk that you will be generating with them. So you may be able to port them over to CDP types that generate synthetic assets other than Dai. However, there may be differences for something like T-bills backing a Euro instead of a USD coin.    Risk Vishesh Dai Analytics 49:40  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  Dai supply has grown to around 85MM most recently. Given all the buzz and appreciation of MKR price, there is a renewal of optimism in the market. Partially fueled by the MCD launch date announcement.  ruxLQwi.png816\u00d7498 136 KB   What was interesting is that at around the same time frame, a bit more collateral was added to the system as an apparent risk hedge. Then it was quiet. Some circulation occurred where collateral was added and removed by various users. Along with the supply increase, more collateral was added again, which is expected. As more DAI is drawn out, more collateral will go in to maintain the collective risk. No bites due to ETH appreciation and lack of quick downward action. The 24hr VWAP is slightly above $1, at $1.005 now. The general conclusion is that the peg is healthy. Trading volume on Dai pairs have been above average in the last 24 hours, at around 4MM, when it\u2019s normally closer to 2MM.  FoStMNR.jpg1525\u00d7752 141 KB   7 Day VWAP is $1.009, with around 16MM in volume.  LeX40Ri.jpg1537\u00d7686 143 KB   Network activity has been very interesting. The transaction volume of Dai has contained a general sustained increase since late April. We\u2019ve seen a spike in Txs in September and in the last few days (and several times since late April.) Primarily driven through increased smart contract usage, moving positions around, increasing them, etc. It will be interesting to see if we see another sustained increase in transaction volumes.  Secondary Lending Platforms  This has been in an interesting state since the recent SF decreases to 10.5%. The borrowing rate on Compound has been more expensive, holding at 12%. Borrow volume has been steady. Despite the incentive to refinance through Maker. The new Dai supply was not a result of refinancing from other protocols. The total Dai borrowing pie has grown by a few million. Supply amounts on SLPs have been relatively steady. Roughly 49MM lent between dYdX and Compound. ~ 10% change upward since the SF drop. Excess supply has a slight increase since borrow hasn\u2019t gone up, minor hit with some position closures. Utilization has taken a dip in the last couple of days.  General Q&A 58:12   Florian Glaz: We just applied as collateral for the MCD system by opening a thread in the Maker forum. Two questions: What is the process from here? & Given that we are applying as a regulated security token, does that alter the process? What can we do to help?  Cyrus: The next steps are that after MCD launches, the first few collateral types will be assessed and added. After that, our Risk team or some other risk team will be able to pick up applications from the forum and begin to evaluate them. In terms of being a security token, one thing that will likely be critical, there is to have some legal-focused review. We are working to facilitate the creation of a process for this kind of need. Depend David: Clarification about the role of the Asset Priority Poll, and whether risk teams do work outside of this priority list? Cyrus: The Asset Priority poll is not something that locks in asset review in stone per se. Risk teams are welcome to choose which collaterals they want to produce reports on. The Asset Priority List is guidance on community preference.   Florian: Regarding these Risk Teams, are they all in-house? Or do you work with outside experts? Is there anything we can provide for reviews on security tokens that might help with this process.  The short answer is that yes, we will need to have external risk teams since it is not feasible for the in-house risk team to handle of MCD collateral onboarding. The vision has always been to have multiple external risk teams that are either generalists or specialist risk teams.   Rune: For security tokens, in general, we should expect a lot of technical overhead for supporting things like whitelists and backdoors. Building external adapters for security tokens will be one thing that significantly impacts the timeline since the Maker protocol doesn\u2019t support those natively. One primary concern is how to deal with a situation where when the token is redeemed for the underlying asset; there needs to be a strict compliance process that needs to happen. Another major issue is how to deal with anti-money-laundering regulations that govern these assets. Just because you have a token on a blockchain doesn\u2019t guarantee a legal claim on the underlying asset. Usually, you prove the chain of custody on an off-chain basis, by showing ownership through an issuer and that there weren\u2019t any compliance conflicts.  Florian: There is no whitelist on the token level, and we complied with the Gem-join standard adapter. As for the legal claim on the underlying token, we don\u2019t see the need to evaluate its chain of custody for the entire lifetime once we redeem its base-value. When you want to redeem the token at the end of the lifetime of the fund, then the owner of that address will have to KYC, potentially via video. If they aren\u2019t on the blacklist, then they could redeem the Euro balance. If they can\u2019t redeem, then it\u2019s recommended they sell it on a secondary market to someone who can redeem it. Rune: The edge cases have to be considered here. Especially if you can prove that an asset was used for terrorist financing, for example. You need to be very careful about keeping tokens clean. If tokens do end up having legal claims as a risk, then one solution is building a specific KYC compliance layer just for that coin used in the CDP. So we can greenlight the asset before it enters a CDP. This prevents the DAI generated from becoming insolvent in the future due to legal claims. It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s always a risk decision, but it can extrapolate out, so the SF or the debt ceiling is affected by this. Florian: Thank you, and we\u2019re happy to have these discussions with the risk team. Maybe we can produce a framework around security tokens as a result.   David: We released our governance roadmap for things that need to happen before the launch of MCD, for example, the DSR initial values poll, collateral inclusion poll, risk assessment of initial collateral, polls on all other configurable parameters, including their auction parameters. With the Nov 18th launch date, how many of these need to happen? Does it have to launch with these completed?  Rune: The basic thinking is that the launch of MCD is going to be functional. Cool new features will be available immediately. Bridging to new DAI is going to be available immediately. The broader governance will take longer to get up and running. How governance takes full control and has a proper rationale for every decision, and ultimately every parameter in the system, is an open question. There has to be a clear prioritization about what are the most important parts to configure as quickly as possible. In the beginning, the priority is the migration itself. We want to do that sooner than later; the bigger the ecosystem, the harder the upgrade. Critical base risk parameters Debt ceiling, Liquidation Ratio, SF for collateral types, will likely come first. The Foundation will propose interim values for all of these things. The community can then scrutinize these and offer rational arguments for changes that need to be made. Because it\u2019s already tough for governance to wrap their heads around the current major parameters. The granular details can be proposed upfront by the risk team in the launch proposal. The system is going to always be in flux. Governance has to view the system as prioritizing correctly and helping the system grow. If certain mistakes are made and we learn, that\u2019s part of the evolutionary process. Bigger picture matters first.    ",

FX34BhU.png1416\u00d7420 132 KB   The Collateralization Ratio went down a bit, then bounced back as a result of CDP owner behavior during the ETH price drop.   rR9kSRw.png1393\u00d7421 267 KB   These are Collateralization Ratios of CDPs by bucket.  Secondary Lending Platforms   The third biggest liquidations, in value, happened on Maker, but you can see how much this impacted other platforms. Especially dYdX, where liquidations ultimately affected rates.   6K82l3i.png1403\u00d7372 54.8 KB   $5,000,000 of MKR moved to three CDP Vault owners. Likely they\u2019re just speculating on MKR. However, they paid fees with DAI and not MKR. 400K in fees paid.   veXeTWc.png1312\u00d7424 94.4 KB   Rates went down, dYdX borrow and supply went down most dramatically. About 40% of the debt outstanding wiped. Since the borrow volume dropped, the rates went down, and then so did the supply amounts.   3cetwxl.png1333\u00d7420 66.3 KB   SAI supply leaving other platforms. Not sure where, but some are moving to Maker. My bet is on some motion into USDC, but I can\u2019t be entirely sure where the SAI is moving.    Market liquidity at Compound is low currently. If supply rates go 4% higher, then it would compete in the market. We\u2019ll see some of the SAI savers migrate to DAI. They will likely use the migration contract. The most important factor is the exchange migration next week.  Questions to Primoz 09:51  Rich: 16% in DSR sounds fantastically high to me because it presupposes that 16% of Dai holders have nothing better to do with their Dai. Isn\u2019t Dai being used the portion that\u2019s not in DSR?  Primoz: Possibly, but there are only 10 days of data, so I don\u2019t want to make any judgments on this.    Monetary Policy in MCD Primoz Kordez 26:59  CyKkaPI.png1339\u00d7627 55.1 KB   uDCjoQr.png1364\u00d7683 94.5 KB   4bZoSlo.png1389\u00d7624 90.4 KB   The spread is a function of risk but could affect monetary policy.   N1CHcSZ.png1387\u00d7728 75.8 KB   We only have practical experience with the negative correlation here \u2014 the higher the stability fee, the lower the DAI supply. The exact slope is outside of Maker\u2019s current tooling, and it\u2019s a broad scope. Including secondary lending platforms etc.   M9fK3tq.png564\u00d7561 47.9 KB   The above is a multi-curve graph in MCD. DSR and SF on top; and simple supply/demand plots on the bottom. These graphs combined assist with a visual, leading monetary policy through a fixed spread, since we can adjust DSR to boost Dai demand. Like the previous DAI graph, this graph is a negative correlation; E.G., lower the SF, the higher the DAI supply. We advise a tight spread from a 2% risk assumption.   R1ThHbB.jpg1367\u00d7684 133 KB    Monetary Spread is a term I came up with to equal the difference between the effective spread and the risk premium. This spread can tell us how the DSR Utilization behaves. Risk premium is always offset depending on the Utilization Rate of the DSR.   re9qGCv.jpg1403\u00d7738 187 KB   I believe observing and measuring Monetary Spread and Effective Spread is very important for us to understand how rate adjustments might affect coverage of risk premiums since DSR utilization is constantly changing. When deciding monetary policy, we should have in our minds that DSR utilization will change. You can assume 100% utilization to be conservative and cover risk premiums. If you believe DSR Utilization will not be very high, then the spread that we set could be a bit lower than the risk premium. Keeping the spread close to risk premium is an additional carrot to consider, making sure that we\u2019re accounting for the utilization rate.    HQ4KKcj.png1399\u00d7653 131 KB  Questions and Discussion 34:46  Rich: How do we get a sense of cause and effect, also elasticity in the system?  Primoz: You could look at secondary lenders to see how rates affected the supply/borrow markets. It\u2019s not easy since it\u2019s interrelated and has a lot of confounding variables. Rich: Exactly. There are quite a few variables. Do we need more 3-6 month empirical studies? Primoz: That would help, but you need to look at the market holistically. Especially since the Ether price is significant to the variables affecting each other. For example, borrowers on Maker are less sensitive to SF raises during bull markets.    44:32  Rich: How do we use this to determine what we should vote on weekly? Should we bundle any factors?  Primoz: Is your question with regards to the migration, or classic monetary policy? Rich: This is the key issue we\u2019re dealing with, balancing migration and then transitioning into classical monetary policy. I am mostly concerned about cognitive overhead, operational overhead, and organizational risk. Four or five polls per week is intense. I\u2019m looking for a graph that states something; E.G., \u201cchange these two numbers\u201d and ignore the rest. Primoz: Specified risk premiums provide a defined spread. That\u2019s being developed. Understanding how savers and borrowers behave is essential. We\u2019ve learned that savers are much more sensitive than borrowers. Knowing how bullish a market is, comparing with analysis, following the data will help indicate some directions. Rich: The cadence of administration is the most important. Thanks for sharing the borrow/lending relationship. Another reminder about changing factors and how they ripple throughout the ecosystem.    Rich Summary 49:13  We need to chat about governance version two, including a governance system audit that includes our tooling, systems, processes, and functions, which need to be improved to sustain DAI in the future. I\u2019m partial to the application model since we debate issues and configure that application. We have to figure out the model of what we\u2019re going to change and the expected results. Our focus as a community should be project planning, specifying requirements, identifying stakeholders, data reporting, meetings, and building what we need. With this seismic shift in our \u2018application,\u2019 then we can engage an audit as a project. Collecting issues, collating, prioritizing them, creating visibility around them, and forming a working group. E.G.:  Identifying the wins and failures of governance. Revisiting the polling cadence, if it works and if it was effective. Thinking about how we measure the effects of our monetary policy. A communication review, how to keep the ecosystem informed, and how the protocol works. Weak Executive Votes is a worry that we need to address. Our first MCD executive had to blend technical fixes and monetary policy. Voting apathy. Low visibility hats. Cognitive overhead. Scheduling and calendar difficulties. How often we need to do things and how frequently. We\u2019ll need to figure out how to publish information to everyone at large, from forum poll to on-chain vote. Collecting data for supporting previous assumptions.   The point is: there is lots of work to do. MakerDAO has the programs to pay people, and many projects within those programs.  Questions and Discussion 1:01:41  LFW: Robert, from Compound, shares plans for cDAI via Rocket Chat, and the blog post he linked  5QgGJIK.png697\u00d7285 29.1 KB    1:03:37  Taking another opportunity to continue earlier thread: it\u2019s essential to create this formal group. By formalizing this process with issue trackers, ticketing, and version control, we\u2019ll have a broader and significant impact. Workflow options to track success and ownership is essential. Github boards and issues will probably be the most helpful for the application and product model I mentioned. Looking forward to getting this working group started!

Today\u2019s call is going to be a little more relaxed. I want to see what we can do about making the content of the call come about more organically. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Discussion 02:59   Chris Blec: I don\u2019t see many back and forth discussions on these calls. It\u2019s usually straightforward, with not a lot of room for disagreement. It would be interesting to try debates on these calls.  Inviting people to share counterpoints and alternative views on the call is essential. Our goal should be to get a better understanding of the other points of view. Rich: I think a part of it is that we are wonderfully aligned on this call about our goals.   LFW: Our alignment should be rooted in our commitment to scientific governance. My idea is that there should be one right view for the given evidence.  Alex Evans: That\u2019s very difficult to do. David: Complex matters will have a divergence of good views that align with scientific governance. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s binary.   Alex Evans: What maximizes engagement? I\u2019ve noticed that engagement happens when there is something to talk about. For example, a few months back, when everyone was discussing the SF adjustment policy at a time when the consistency of the raises was causing controversy.  One thing that might be interesting to do is asking ourselves, \u201cDo we want to generate engagement at the cost of something else that might be more useful?\u201d Educational presentations, like Nik\u2019s presentation on Oracles a few meetings ago, may sometimes be more useful, even though they don\u2019t necessarily create as much back and forth engagement.   Rich: Maybe it\u2019s a question of what is an appropriate amount of back and forth? We know that we don\u2019t have a lot of time in these calls, and these calls are more of a push-medium. Matt Lucas: As someone who doesn\u2019t engage too much, often, the amount of information on these calls is a lot to take in, let alone engage about. One idea is to front-run things a little better in these calls. If people come to the call prepared to discuss and think about a specific topic, it may increase engagement.  LFW: Agree, one of my points is that presentations are hard to digest at the time of the call. I\u2019d like to see presentations put in the forum before the call, and then also repeated in the call, then questions called for. Serves both those with time to prep and those that don\u2019t. Rich: MakerDAO governance is work. It takes community members doing homework and devoting time to keeping themselves updated to be able to engage most effectively. We\u2019ve been working hard on crafting solutions as a community to reduce the overhead, creating summaries, recaps, central threads, etc\u2026   Matthew Rab: I think what we\u2019re struggling with attracting more voters due to the disillusionment of whales voting, and the complexity of many of the matters. One idea is to change the output of the SF poll to be the weighted average of all the votes rather than the winning choice itself. This would give small-holders the ability to have a real impact; even if small, it would be real.  Rich: There are so many pros and cons here. What\u2019s the most important thing? To guarantee the security of the system by allowing the people with the most to lose to be able to fail? Or is it to have a financial system that is most closely tied to how the aggregate wants it to be, from an ideological perspective? Matthew: My argument is that we all have something to lose, not just whales. For binary votes, it might not work. But for computed models, it might be better. For example, on SF adjustments. Rich: I\u2019m concerned about the hidden flaws of a mechanism like this. LFW, for example, brings up the point of Sybil resistance for the approach you are advocating for Matthew. LFW: wouldn\u2019t people vote for the minimum or maximum values to maximize the effectiveness of their votes? Matthew: I don\u2019t think this is necessarily an issue. It\u2019s a way of digesting the votes to get to the right combined decision.   Chris: To bring this discussion back to the topic of how we get increased voter engagement, the idea that MKR holders look for recommendations on how to vote raises the question of, what are we actually trying to accomplish on this call?  Do we want to come out of these calls with recommendations? I am assuming most of us in this call are smaller MKR holders. How do we know larger MKR holders are listening to these discussions? What info/summaries do we want top HOLDlers to have? Are recommendations too esoteric? David: To answer Chris\u2019s question about what we are trying to accomplish with these public discussions, I believe it is to have publicly documented reasoning around the best recommendations for various matters in governance. This way, if a large MKR holder votes contrary to the consensus of public discussion, there is a campaign that can be made. Matthew: What I\u2019m trying to protect against, to your point David, is the risk of a hard fork where the whales who far outweigh the public governance community no longer adhere to the discussions and essentially go rogue. Chris: I think we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the impact of public discourse for smaller MKR holders. If what you say has impact your 2 MKR might have a 2000 MKR impact on the actual vote.   Rich: Excellent Conversation   Governance  The next 3-6 months will be a transformative season in MakerDAO governance. Addressing issues like representation, campaigns, robust resources, and alignment.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 42:21   The forums have been pretty quiet this week. The only thing I\u2019d mention is the Debt Ceiling poll is live right now, and discussions are open to anyone with an opinion they want to present. Governance at a Glance Thread  Risk Vishesh Dai Analytics 43:00  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  It\u2019s been quiet across metrics this week, despite the fact the SF was lowered. Dai supply took a hit with the jump in ETH price about a week ago. Since then, it\u2019s been coming up slowly; at the time of this call, there are 80.8MM Dai in circulation.  jyU2HAg.png806\u00d7508 133 KB   Long term relationships between collateral and ETH price remain strong. It seems to be one of the most predictable behaviors of users on the whole.  eQXQmuY.png1022\u00d7496 99.3 KB   The average daily volume on Dai markets has been around 2MM. In relation to other assets, it is small with thin liquidity. The order books tend to have fairly light liquidity, which makes Dai susceptible to price crunches. 24Hr VWAP is 1.005, 1.48MM in volume.  XrOUM2p.jpg1531\u00d7760 131 KB   7 Day VWAP is 1.008, 17.78MM volume  fnRZNkD.png1408\u00d7637 186 KB    Secondary Lending Platforms  Borrow rates are more expensive on Compound than on the Maker protocol. It\u2019s interesting to watch the delay in refinancing between these systems. Supply rates have tracked closely with the Stability Fee. Borrow volumes of dYdX have come up a little but generally can be considered stable at the moment.  huVuBFV.jpg1517\u00d7774 95.6 KB   Supply volumes also remain stable despite the SF adjustment.  2YCkVz9.jpg1521\u00d7790 105 KB    Questions to Vishesh  Rich: Concerns about smart contracts out there, especially as the collateral starts auto-responding to market spiraling? Mostly concerned about Instadapp, Compound, and Maker.  Vishesh: I see Instadap as a rate arbitrage tool. Filtering out to see transaction volume affecting MKR and DAI is probably an economic efficiency layer applied to the system. I don\u2019t really see the case where auto-responses are bad. Sometimes its more concerning when there isn\u2019t a quick response to market changes. Rich: My concern is with runaway bots. There was a time that DAI was listed on an exchange, and it had native trading bots. So you could see these strange price changes around the peg. Just wondering if the same risk applies to smaller protocols with amounts affecting the ecosystem at large.    ",

Today I hope we can have a Q&A session about concerns regarding what might be going on in the community. Additionally, this is a chance we can take to call out where we are lacking and to reinforce the great things about our community that we\u2019ve been getting right. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance  We\u2019ve been working hard to create a community where people can communicate effectively, where debate can happen effectively, where we can achieve consensus, where we can differentiate the will of the people and the will of the stakeholders. We are inventing this universe as we\u2019re going along. I was recently asked a series of questions about what governance means at MakerDAO. I told them I have no idea, but a part of it is that we are building something new here. We\u2019re a governance system that is partly open-sourced in culture, loose associations of highly engaged stakeholders getting together to manage a huge and complicated ship. The way we manage this thing is by communication and acting based on our mutual agreements and discussions. It\u2019s been a pleasure to watch the governance community gradually build up. We have Rocketchat where real-time conversations happen. We have the forums, where serious governance conversations happen: they are a great example of how our community has self-organized and has created processes around how discussions and votes occur in the community. We have our weekly governance calls, where we broadcast information, work on social cohesion, and we have the opportunity to deal with more pressing issues. In the end, proposals end up on the voting portal, and that\u2019s where Maker Token Holders get to make the final decisions. One recent example is the move from linear rate-stepping to exponential rate-stepping, which started as a conversation and is now being voted on. We have a system that works: we have smart people communicating with each other to do things right, for the benefit of this ecosystem.  Open Conversation  It\u2019s important to differentiate between noise and legitimate signals. Crypto-twitter contrarianism is a sort of \u201cbrand,\u201d it earns likes and followers and can make a lot of noise. Our community\u2019s brand/culture is to be cool, calm, considered, and to do things intelligently in the best possible way that we can to shepherd this protocol to success.  We need to understand the role of social media in relation to our project. We need to recognize the risk of being swayed by uneducated/emotional sentiment.   People picking at us on the basis of outrage should be ignored. We look for legitimate arguments, legitimate rebuttals, all while we\u2019re focusing together on solving the problem.  12:58: Chris Blec: Is this coming from a place where we want to maintain tighter quality control over the conversation in total, or is this about protecting productivity?  No, those aren\u2019t the main drivers. Firstly, we don\u2019t want to control the conversation but rather to remind stakeholders and community members about the reality of noise. I wanted to reinforce that we have these mechanisms in place where healthy and informed debate happens with people who are deeply knowledgeable of the system and who are working on its success, and it\u2019s not always such on crypto-twitter.    15:15: Cyrus: I think one consideration is that DAOs, as a class, are in an early state. As a result, they are ripe for capture by bad actors, by mob rule, and so forth. There is a reason we\u2019ve been harping on this scientific governance meme for so long. It\u2019s because we\u2019re trying to get our community to support and enforce a proper methodology to run MakerDAO.  Our mediums of discourse have been pre-defined, in that we have a process in place to rigorously vet for the best decisions to be made in the system. I think whenever possible, we should always remind people that the only gate-keepers for the system itself are MKR token holders, not random voices, not the foundation, social media, etc. As MKR holders, I think that the community is very open to receiving input. Ultimately, there\u2019s a model in place to have conversations about things like centralized collateral.   Many people have different understandings of what MakerDAO is, and how the intellectual discourse happens.  Scientific Governance, although the term may annoy some, is not a term we are giving up. Maybe it\u2019s not executed perfectly, but it\u2019s an aspirational thing that Maker Governance is striving for. As a community, we expect reproducibility, evidence, clean data, debate, prudence, integrity in conversation, etc.    21:45: Cyrus: I think once we go through our first Governance cycle in MCD, where we go through re-adding ETH as a collateral, in addition to some of the others, people will become more aware of the process, the models, and the numbers of it all. Hopefully, the public will realize how much careful work goes into making the right decision behind adding any collateral centralized or not.  23:22: Chris:    A lot of the chatter in the past week also involved Rune engaging and even starting many of these conversations. The entire foundation must be on the same page about this stuff.     A lot of my time is spent on social media, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to shelter Maker\u2019s governance from public opinion. I think our best aim would be to educate rather than control.   Rich: I agree with you, Chris, and I hope that\u2019s not the impression I gave with how I introduced this conversation. We can\u2019t control public opinion. This conversation is more about doing better as a group to focus people on educating themselves about the protocol, the governance process, and the general basis for how we make our decisions as voters.   Chris Blec: There\u2019s a lot we can do to steer the conversation in a better direction. We should be getting into it and trying to get ahead and above it whenever we can.  Cyrus & Rich: I agree with that completely.    31:30: Cyrus: I think this is a reminder to ourselves that we have a process in place that handles any disagreements that arise in the community. It\u2019s not that we have these formal processes to be centralized, but rather we put these processes in place to get the most unbiased unemotional procedure to calculate risk parameters, manage the system, and so forth, this is my main takeaway.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 34:32   Governance at a Glance Thread A lot of the conversation was about the use of centralized assets in MCD:  What\u2019s the point of adding stablecoins as collateral? PurityDai: a potential solution to the real world collateral controversy   A short status on each of the signaling threads:   Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  It is currently on-chain, and is looking like it will pass.    Should we change the stability fee poll cadence?  No majority for change In general, people think the SF poll cadence is fine. For now, it is settled, we can repoll again in the future.    Signal Request: Should we increase the SCD debt ceiling?  At the time of this call, the winning option is one immediate increase of the debt ceiling by 20MM, resulting in a 120MM total debt ceiling. Cyrus: Is interested in seeing the poll re-run in light of the recent supply drop. LFW: The poll is still active, so anyone can go and change their choice. Cyrus: my personal opinion is that there is no issue one way or another. There doesn\u2019t seem to be demand for Dai above 100MM, and with the recent drop, it currently looks like a non-issue.      Questions   40:01: Chris Blec: Question about forum polls in general. Signal Request forum threads are becoming more and more critical. I feel that they are not easy to find. Is there anything we can do to increase the exposure of those threads?  Rich: yes, there are a lot of things we can do. The community needs to step up. There have been ideas about using twitter bots, email newsletters, and more. The push/pull thing is a hard question to answer. Chris: my thinking was even purely on the forum itself. Rich: Yes, you\u2019re right. We can potentially make a signal request category for better visibility. Resulting thread: Using RSS Feeds for forum email notifications     Risk Vishesh Dai Analytics 42:35  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights: 42:35   ETH dropped very heavily over the last week or so. Initially, we had a run-up of ETH price, right before it dropped back down a few days ago. As the ETH price was running up, there was an increase in activity, Dai supply rose up to 85MM-86MM. Once the price drop happened, the Dai supply dropped back down to where it was before around 79MM-80MM.  1MRBo9M.png911\u00d7547 111 KB    88Tucmx.png888\u00d7537 148 KB   On the same time-frame, a fair amount of collateral that was added, as the price dropped down, there was even more collateral added as expected. The relationship between ETH price and collateral has continued to hold.  qj2aZEn.png885\u00d7534 132 KB   The amount of collateral added has continually grown. The amount of collateral removed has grown as well, though the rate at which it\u2019s removed has slowed down.  9blqZ3s.png1257\u00d7532 139 KB   Bites/Liquidations recently jumped up, a non-trivial amount. People should be aware of this risk and should check their expectations of ETH price movements.  ZQQkg6P.png1098\u00d7520 107 KB   Dai price has been fairly steady above $1, with low variation.  492VSrJ.jpg1703\u00d7779 175 KB   In the last 7 days, trading volume has been significantly higher, at around 26.5MM  Even between the ETH price movement, higher volumes, and Dai supply movement, the peg has remained steady.    Secondary Lending Platforms: 48:50   Recently the borrow rates have kept less of a buffer to the SF than we\u2019ve seen in the past. An emerging theory is that at higher rates the buffer is naturally larger.  0SkryXx.png1882\u00d7774 92.2 KB   Borrow on Compound has taken a hit, likely as a result of the drop in Stability Fees and some large refinances back to MakerDAO.  18BTLnV.png1868\u00d7772 49.2 KB   Supply volume has been steady on Compound, while dYdX has seen more growth.  xTes18Q.png1883\u00d7804 48.3 KB   The excess supply of Dai on those platforms has consistently grown in the last couple of months.  3rlfIZB.png1872\u00d7775 52.8 KB   The utilization rate has consistently dropped for Compound since the beginning of August, dropping from the mid-70s to low-mid 60s.  rysjCn9.png1869\u00d7764 67.1 KB    Post-call Questions: 55:23    56:51: What\u2019s the next step for the Governance Facilitator role that was passed?  Rich: We needed to formalize the role that I am in so that we can replace me with community members. The goal is, post-MCD, once we understand the mechanisms in place for how the community funds its own actors, we will take the template of the Governance Facilitator the community can vote in additional people to fill this role.    01:00:08: When is Oracle mandate going on a poll?  Nik: I think it makes much more sense to have a single week where all the Oracle proposals are voted on in parallel. This will concentrate the discussion comfortably. It\u2019s scheduled for September 30th, next Monday.    01:01:28: Do you have a summary of the feedback we\u2019ve received so far on the Oracle proposals?  The oracle incentives restructuring got the most attention. It was mostly about getting more clarification about the implementation details. Big thanks to LFW for keeping me honest and digging through the details to get things appropriately articulated.

Welcome to the April 30th edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting. Today we will be talking about Governance at a Glance. We will hear from Vishesh about the state of the pegs, or even just singular peg. We will be hearing from MakerMan, who has done a fantastic amount of work for the ecosystem generating a report on auctions based on the events of the zero bid auctions episode. He\u2019ll be walking us through some of the numbers there and hopefully explain some of the most intimidating graphs I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t want to do too much exposition today, but I want to draw some attention to the very cool development that we see more and more in these calls. Traditionally we divide them into the Governance section, Risk section, occasionally Smart Contracts, and Oracle sections. Those are mostly a representation of the Foundation\u2019s bootstrapped and/or internal teams. More and more often, we are allocating time to the community. We have community-led teams where the community begins to self-organize and assume responsibilities, get mandated by other members of the community, and simply self-organize in ways that are fantastically healthy. We\u2019re seeing an example of that today. MakerMan understood that there was work to be done in the ecosystem, and he had the skills to do it. He stepped up and took care of what I can only imagine was, or potentially will be, an enormously thankless job of modeling the events of March 12th, AKA Black Thursday. If you have a chance, give him a thumbs up in the chats. I think that\u2019s the compensation that he gets from the community, at this point, and a pat on the back for the super hard work that this represents. I promised to keep it short, and I will, so here\u2019s the rest of the preamble: if you have questions, please ask them if you have access to a microphone. If you don\u2019t have access to a microphone, type the issue in the sidebar, and one of the co-hosts will attempt to get to them in the opportune moment. Discussions happen in the forum.   Community LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 4:56   Maker MCD Ethereum System Liquidation report and Black Thursday Compensation Analysis  Liquidation Report Not to steal MakerMan\u2019s thunder, but the most significant discussion going on in the forum is the discussion about the liquidation report, which he will present later. Lots of voters discussing possible compensation things. If more core community members want to comment on that thread, that might be beneficial. Rich: Depending on how the community wants to move forward, this is going to be one of the most complex operations that need to be organized. That operation requires alignment, communication, stakeholders, and numerous other activities. It feels like the conversation might be narrowing down a bit, and that feels slightly alarming to me. If you consider yourself a stakeholder in this issue or even a trusted third party, please consider hopping into this thread and make yourself known. Also, if you have skills that you can bring to bear, I\u2019m sure that those additional resources would be appreciated.    Discussion to change Stability Fee\u2019s - Hexonaut  Hexonaut\u2019s post is related to how we currently vote weekly on ETH and BAT together, and then USDC SF separately. He discusses how we can change that structure to make it more sustainable. Sam(Hexonaut): I think you covered the gist of it. I noticed that we added the Dai stability fee, and as we threw USDC in there, we added a vote for it as well. This post is to generalize the structure moving forward. So, when we add the 10th collateral, we don\u2019t have ten weekly stability fee votes. I proposed what I think a decent next step would be for generalization. Rich: Can you go over a brief description of what you\u2019re proposing? Sam: Sure. Since we have Dai-to-Sai, we have encoded all the fees into the duty parameters, the vault specific fees. I\u2019m suggesting that we split the Stability Fee into two portions:  The first portion being the base rate, which is the global fee. That\u2019s the minimum that everything gets set. And on top of that, we have a vault specific fee, which mostly is the risk premium. There\u2019s some discussion about whether it should be only the risk premium or if there are some other parameters that should go in there. But I want to split it out.   Sam: The weekly Dai stability fee remains, and we change that to the base rate vote. For peg stability week to week, we vote on the base rate. The vault specific fees are proposed when we need to change them based on risk premium. In the end, I imagine being only peg vote week to week, and that\u2019s the base rate. Rich: I\u2019m enormously engaged with this idea, naturally because it reduces my administration overhead by like 90%, so I love it. Have you had the time to look at this, Cyrus, or is it too early to present an opinion about feasibility? Cyrus Younessi: The idea is something we\u2019ve all been trying to veer to for a long time now. It\u2019s a great idea. SamM: In terms of timeline, I\u2019m leaving the discussion open for a week or so. If everything settles, I\u2019ll move on to a signal poll. Rich: Maybe we\u2019ll dive into this again next Thursday, maybe do a more in-depth presentation for us, that would be interesting. And also, it touches on one of my favorite points recently: intention versus implementation and the path from one to the other. I like the fact that there\u2019s going to be a discussion for a week and moving into a poll as well. We need a review afterward since this involves numerous stakeholders. Let\u2019s get some thoughts, considering calendering and resource allocation.    Seeking Signal MIPs vote  Most polls are finished now. Does anyone know if the MIPs timing poll was successful? I didn\u2019t even look.  Rich: Yes, it passed. 86%.    [WBTC] - WBTC Collateral Request For Comment  wBTC vote is still going. If you haven\u2019t voted, vote.  Community MakerMan Black Thursday Vault Analysis 12:40 Black Thursday Compensation Analysis Forum Post  Some context: we know when Black Thursday happened. I reported the Zero bid auctions in here, with some numbers in the introduction. Liquidations of 62842 ETH is attributed to 320 vaults.   692\u00d7469 36.8 KB   When you look at the numbers, it cost the protocol $6.65 million. Part of which was reduced by liquidation fees and other auctions. Maker governance did stuff: immediately stopped the auction system, changed the auction parameters themselves: lot sizes to 500 ETH, auction duration to 6 hours, adjusted risk parameters and added USDC for Dai liquidity, added a circuit breaker. Afterward, the community responded, including a large call for auction front-ends. This response allowed for more participants in the auction system and seemed to have helped. We signaled that we wanted to do something, and I was in this situation from the start. Because Black Thursday was an interesting Black Swan. Specifically, what happened, and how can we do better? I think this will be valuable for us in the end, even if right now it\u2019s painful. I was going to refer to all the data sets, thanks to Twicky and Bobface, who contributed data sets. These all are available on the forum. I wanted to look at the whole system because to understand what happens in a bad system, you have to look at it when it\u2019s good.   691\u00d7348 25.6 KB   That table is how this analysis is divided: into natural sections based on assumptions of a properly operating system and where it breaks down. I\u2019m going to walk through the data sets.  14:53  717\u00d7452 53.8 KB   MCD Auction performance vs. Date   699\u00d7454 53.6 KB   The second chart is auction performance by vault. At the 113% percent mark, Maker got its full 13% and recovered Dai liquidity. With the red dots below, that\u2019s the percent collateral returned. You can look at the markets below that, that scatter around zero, where keepers made or lost money relative to the market at the time. You can see the discontinuity at 3-12 and 3-13 corresponding to Black Thursday. There was another discontinuity at 3-16 when we opened up and made changes. I also don\u2019t have the ETH price chart on here I would like to but don\u2019t have the tooling and data. You can look at these auctions by time, and that gives you a great snapshot of what\u2019s happening for most of the period. Cross-referencing with auction number completes the picture. 3-12 to 3-13 are the days we want to focus on. ID:760 is the first point where we started getting zero bids.   872\u00d7562 303 KB   (Editor note: Look at the red dots on the chart line of 20%, that\u2019s when the system is recovering an optimal amount of collateral after collateral auctions) Keepers come online and then bam; another chunk flew out at around 1200. Keepers came in around 2200, and we almost hit 20% again, then another discontinuity. Something was off, and auctions started getting weird.    You can look to the blue dots, follow my mouse pointer, and see keepers struggle to get online. We could use more analysis, especially as things started to return to normal.    Auctions go down, but in time context, it\u2019s hard to understand the where on this graph. Trying to figure out the post-AGC (Auction Governance Change) at this end of the graph. That lays out what happened in auctions dot by dot. The blue line is the tab; I set to 113% because anything below 100 means the protocol loses money. The discontinuities are more clear on this graph, but you could zoom in to see each point where we hit zero. The red line is the collateral returned. In good times we\u2019re getting 20%.  19:16  Rich: All these spikes and peaks are they correlated to a slowdown? Or gas fees in the network, or is there another circumstance?  MM: Throughout this whole period, gas fees were around 300 GWEI. It was challenging. You\u2019d have to do that analysis block by block, which I didn\u2019t do. The data is on-chain but good luck! This data set frames a specific context: \u201cunder severe liquidation stress and compression, what did you think you could get in a fair auction system when you get liquidated?\u201d MM: As a user, one might be like, \u201cI read all the information, I understand that auction performance in a black swan could be instant.\u201d If the OSM is coming down fast, you will get liquidated, and get nothing back, and the protocol will lose money. No \u201cif\u2019s, and\u2019s, or but\u2019s\u201d about this. If the price is moving almost 20% every hour, the system is sending out liquidity hard and fast; then, the markets couldn\u2019t handle it. Everyone was trying to do everything at once led to a huge gas increase on Ethereum. Rich: it seems interesting there are exogenous forces. Well, there are other factors at play here, and I would be happy to hear from other people with better analysis than me. We have several auctions happening at the same time,  network congestion, and liquidity. These are the three factors that would have impacted the success of the auctions. MM: Generally, that\u2019s the impression.      There\u2019s also the additional complexity of time: do you look at the auction time as when they deal? There\u2019s a whole period, of about 10 minutes, where things happened. So what do you call the time stamp? It seems like deal time was best since that\u2019s when you can act on it and take advantage of the market. You pick a time stamp for some event and then align the data with that. I don\u2019t have this by how they were kicked in the first phase. I have it by when they go through deal. I didn\u2019t evaluate that as an analysis point, you can pull it, you can see when the deal hits and you can see when it\u2019s confirmed, we\u2019d need mempool analysis for that. My analysis, overall, gave us an idea of what auctions look like when they\u2019re good or not. Thanks to Lev for the formula correction to 24.67% for collateral return.   695\u00d7194 26.2 KB    We\u2019re mostly over it now, though someone is overpaying on auctions. One can view the red as an indicator for when it got difficult, if you average it all out when it was good, it was around 10%. My question was just to get a look at it. I knew that every data point here was a person, 320 of them. There are hundreds of people here thrown under an onslaught. This analysis is my best to figure out what happened to them and how that looked.   711\u00d7280 21 KB   Breaking it down from there, I do some more analysis.  The vast amount of action is in the Black Thursday and post-AGC period. You still see losses in the pre-AGC and post AGC period. We should not have losses that post to the system. In periods where I think it was stable, the biggest issue was collateral returned. Even in post AGC, where we should be good, it was almost as bad as Black Thursday.   784\u00d7648 185 KB   I broke these periods of auctions down, looking into bids and breaking it out there to find a result and an average. Though these aren\u2019t weighted averages, they don\u2019t have the volume underneath. What I saw universally: the one bid auctions nail us every time (in orange). The tab inefficiency was bad. Of course, this was in BT, so it\u2019s expected to be horrible. At the first table, 113% tab efficiency should be good, but 0% returned? Really?!?  What happened there? That\u2019s when it was good. Even afterward, the third table and first row in orange, we have 122 returning 1.88 % with a tab efficiency of 95%; it means we lost money in total.   751\u00d7458 130 KB   Post AGC, when it\u2019s supposed to be better, we get no zero bid auctions. Which is awesome. But we go and look at the yellow section; we got 12, 13, 16, 14 percent returned in here. These are for three or more bids. You can average them all out again, but post-AGC needs another careful look. I broke this down by lot size.    The smaller lots seemed to perform as good or better than the larger ones. You can easily bid up smaller auctions if you\u2019re already on the hook for that Dai. But if you look at the 500ETH lots, all paid barely 3% back. There are 76 out of 142 of those. There are some conclusions: the one bid auctions suck, indicated by the data. I try not to argue much. Just present the data.  BT Analysis Questions and Comments 27:39  Rich: This is a huge data dump, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff going on here. What do you mean by two bids? Are you suggesting that unless two people are bidding, the auction is invalid?  MakerMan: The recommendation is that you want two different bidders, at least that, and then ideally three bids. If you have that as a minimum requirement, it probably will get you a better result, but I didn\u2019t have the unique number of bidders at the time. At some point, I will get that data. Possibly add more even beyond that. I have the number of bids, the sequence changes, not who did them, and how many. And you want that data, ideally. So I looked at the number of bids that they received and the lot size. Rich: Do you suppose that it\u2019s just too rich for people\u2019s blood or people don\u2019t want to put that value at risk? MakerMan: That\u2019s the conclusion, on the 500s, is that it\u2019s just too much Dai. That\u2019s the real conclusion. The 500\u2019s are just too big.    29:12  Nik Kunkel: I haven\u2019t gone through the analysis in detail, so this is the first time I\u2019m hearing the reasoning, and the data explained. Correct me if I got anything wrong. What I did notice is that you keep bringing up the OSM with regards to the price. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right approach here. The OSM exists not to say \u201cthis is the price right now,\u201d but in my opinion, it exists as a buffer to protect the system from oracle attacks. It\u2019s not necessarily indicative of what the price of something currently is or should be to our best estimate. Why aren\u2019t you using the medianizer price as a reference rather than the OSM?  MakerMan: I had to do this by hand, if you give me a dataset, it can be added to the data, no problem. I need a medianizer data set marginalized to the right time points for the actual auctions themselves. I only have two datasets that followed that criteria, which happened to be the OSM and then Uniswap, which is also on-chain. I have both of those here. It was arbitrary what datasets I had at the time that I could use. The first thing I put in here was the hour price marks in here by hand. MM: The light blue and the purple in Fig1 was me adding the hour marks on a real fine time scale. Ideally, for Black Thursday, this data is here for its own complete sake. That was just one of the metrics. I have a whole bunch of them, take your pick and give me the data for it. OSM is not the greatest price point to use; I completely agree! You want a good market price, and the medianizer would probably be ideal. I\u2019ve not looked at that, so you\u2019re probably right. I don\u2019t understand it that well, but if it\u2019s an average and the collective price volume-weighted, great! Give me whatever you got. Nick Kunkel: I can send you that data. Or send you a script, if you want to be able to ensure data integrity that you could run to collect more data. MakerMan: Both would be nice because then it can be audited. That would be great, yes. And more is better in this case.    32:28  Rich: Some interesting discussions are happening on the sidebar, and I want to encourage people that have access to a microphone to jump in because the sidebar chat doesn\u2019t get captured if you wish to have your comments on the record it\u2019s essential that you jump on the mic.  32:49  Cyrus: I have a couple of comments about the lot size. Potentially an additional factor for decreased efficiency could be the six-hour TTL change. Since the lot size and TTL were both increased at the same time. It\u2019s hard to say how much each one is contributing to the decrease in auction efficiency. I think it\u2019s both, but it\u2019s hard to say which one is having more of an impact.  MakerMan: Well, I can comment right now with data.      In table 7b, in the 50-500 lot, we\u2019re getting 11% in that range. So there\u2019s your data point, telling you that you\u2019re already doing better at the smaller lot size. I have a recommendation on this too. We should throw out different kinds of lot sizes all the time. That way, we can get data, gauge liquidation conditions, and pricing conditions over the liquidity spread. You do that simultaneously when you kick out an auction. It\u2019s a recommendation I have later. I didn\u2019t get to it. I\u2019ll pause for questions.  Cyrus: I\u2019m not saying that the lot size isn\u2019t having an impact. I\u2019m just saying that there are potentially other factors as well. Cyrus: Another comment is regarding the governance trade-off. If we\u2019re trying to optimize for the average case or the worst case? One of the issues that were popping up during Black Thursdays was the insane amount of transactions and network congestion. Having to bid on, say, ten times as many auctions creates an additional burden on keepers, which was, I think, one of the main reasons for increasing the lot size. That would result in subsequent auctions, on average, performing much more poorly. But then it would potentially be more beneficial during times of extremely high network congestion. At the very least, it\u2019s a trade-off of whether we want better performing auctions on the day to day, or if we want to have better keeper activity during times of high network congestion. MM: Ideally, you would want to sample this in the spread. You want to probe the network with some large size network auctions, right. Do you keep consistently pounding out at 500? I don\u2019t know if I have this as a suggestion, but one of the things I was talking about is that the sheer amount of liquidity that tries to hit the market, you need to throttle that. You can\u2019t just throw out $5 million, or $3 million, or whatever the real numbers were, half a million at a time, chunks of collateral, and expect keepers to be able to manage all that and do anything with it. Because they just don\u2019t have the liquidity to make the bids. They depend on cycling that liquidity over time. MM: You need to think about a rate that your auctions can kick out stuff at, and then do it in a spread that keepers can understand. Because then you can encourage keepers who will deal with the amounts that are in the 1-10 range, or whatever Dai amount, up to a couple of thousands. And then other keepers will go from those couple thousand to ten, and then another chunk of keepers that will do the tens to 500k, maybe, in one lot. But you need to see if those keepers even remotely can handle that kind of liquidity in some way. JoeQ: I don\u2019t mind decreasing from 500 down to 250. MM: I agree with your first points, that timing part of this is an issue, in terms of how long you have to keep your liquidity there and how long you have to wait through the market fluctuations to get a bid. The auction process itself could use rethinking, but all of these issues are in play. JoeQ: I think we should keep at least 3 to 4 hours, just in case for people to cycle through until we have a better mechanism. I don\u2019t mind decreasing the lot sizes, because the ETH price has doubled, so it\u2019s a lot of money to put up right now. MM: I will say that longer auctions are better. I\u2019ve been missing them as a person. Some of them just run by me, and I move on to the next one. There are not that many in good times.    ",

                    "content": "38:03  LFW: A quick point on lot sizes, we could try a compromise parameter. 50 to 500 is a ten-time increase. We could try something that\u2019s less an increase, like 100 or something.  MM: We could do 20, 40, 80, 160, or something like that. Some kind of range like that, in factors of 2. LFW: Currently, we can only do one at the time. There\u2019s only one parameter, and the system can only support having one. MM: You\u2019re right; it\u2019s the contract that would require changing to do to spread out. There\u2019s a lump function so you can just pick a small size and change how it\u2019s fanning out; you just make that more modest and have it do it\u2019s fan-out differently, that\u2019s all. LFW: If we\u2019re talking about the things that we could do immediately, we could try a compromise parameter for lot size. 100 is still twice what we had on Black Thursday. MM: Yes, I agree. If you\u2019re going to do anything within the system now, definitely bring it down. And it looked like 50 was pretty good, but if we think we need additional liquidity, I don\u2019t think 100 will be enough if we run into another black swan event. 25% isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s the back-to-back 25% that was the real nailer. The second one was coming literally within 24 hours. Bam-bam! And that was after going down; I think 10% from $220 or $210, into the $180 range. (If I remember my prices right here as I was looking at all of this.) Price was about 10% down, and then did a 25% down, it was like Bam! And then it paused for a bit, and then within 24 hours, it did another 25% that took the OSM right down to $100. And then it just came back up quickly to $120 or something like that. Rich: I\u2019m going to poke people in the sidebar again because it seems that they\u2019re proposing innovative solutions that are going to get lost unless that we mention them.    40:15  SamM: One idea was to throttle, I think that requires smart contract modifications? Another way we could throttle is: to put a sane minimum bid of maybe 20%, or 30% or something, just so they have to stake something, before kicking off an auction.  MM: I have that as a recommendation that before you even deal it, you can do it as a kick as well. That there should be a minimum required bid, that I picked as a percentage of the OSM, just because the OSM is the metric that Maker uses to determine its brain of action. When it\u2019s going to act, it\u2019s going to respond when its OSM changes, so maybe we should have other things in the systems change, and that\u2019s one of them. SamM: It\u2019s minor change though, LongForWisdom, regarding the smart contracts. If there\u2019s one, it\u2019s a lot easier than putting \u201conly so much collateral can be auctioned at a time\u201d throttling mechanism. LFW: Sure. That makes sense. Chris shared a link to PR fix, but that\u2019s been done. MM: I would encourage all the noodling on this, just put it on the forums, because I knew that this would spur tons of discussions already from several takeaways on the report, so all the stuff is good. We need it. Put it there. The more data, the better, I think, on the data and analytics.    41:58  Rich: This is a great conversation, but we\u2019re running out of time. Sorry, MakerMan, can we move back to your recommendations at the bottom of the report?  MM: I had the points here; you can read them. I have conclusions. The performance of the auction was impaired; we can see it. When they did come up, we got back 10-11%, you can look at these full averages. You can look at the figure and try to guess what you think the number is, what you would expect there.     729\u00d7630 50.5 KB   MM: This image illustrates the impaired performance. When we have more keepers, we have this pre-AGC period. There were still auctions even after this event that hit the 10-14% range. And post-AGC, we see examples of two times as many bidders or bids, depends on how you define it. We need to look at the bidders, and the lot sizes increase. But the total collateral is down. For vault-holders, we\u2019re kind of sucking at the auction system right now. 3.5% now, and it should be kind of normal-ish versus almost 18% before, and that\u2019s even short of the 25% theoretical, but I guess you could expect that. You could data-average this. So, the recommendations:  Consider rejecting deals and re-kicking auctions, if you don\u2019t have three bids and two unique bidders. If we can do that, I think it would help. We could debate whether it would or whether it\u2019s game-able, that\u2019s a separate issue. I just have it as a recommendation. If the bid deal is not at least some fraction of the OSM, you kick it right back into the bidding system. Don\u2019t let it go. You need to flag governance to say: am I going to let this one go or not? This should be accumulated and then re-issued with some thinking behind it. If we\u2019re looking at like a third of the market, there\u2019s a certain point I have ideas on how to liquefy the system, but there\u2019s a certain point where price-drop just nails you, and there\u2019s not much that you can do about it. Consider staggering and standardizing lot sizes. You want to throw different sizes. I give an idea on how to do that. You want to get a feeling for what markets will do at all times by staggering these lot sizes. If you can do that, you can sample your market by the size of the liquidity, and it will immediately give you statistics on system operations. Just a suggestion, I know it requires contract changes. I suggested going back to a lot size of 50 ETH. It shouldn\u2019t be more than 50, given what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s all debatable. Performance issues could be due to timing; it could be other stuff going on; we don\u2019t have enough data. I would completely agree with that. It looks that longer auctions do get more bids. If you think that getting more bids makes it better, it should, but then you could go back and look. We are not getting better bids in those bigger auction sizes, and that data stands out itself. Whatever is going on in the bidding system is related to the lot size. Whether it is related to the new time element or not is unclear because we just didn\u2019t have big auctions back then. And then, I tried to run this in a compensation analysis. This will be too long if I go through all of this:     742\u00d7422 128 KB   You ask, \u201cwhat do you think the collateral return should be if you thought these auctions were impaired, and you were going to compensate?\u201d It\u2019s pretty simple. And when you think about it in Ethereum, it even becomes simpler. You can always reference it to a price somehow, but how you do that, you have to decide it and run it through the data. I kind of refused to do that. Just given the number of scenarios I was already looking at. Evaluating collateral return deficit with a fixed number of vaults here, the 114 column in table 8 is pretty much all the auctions that fit the criteria of the nominal collateral return. 113 or under, by definition, should not get any collateral back, and these should all stay the same. This evaluation was a sanity check of my spreadsheet-database asking myself, was I doing the right thing. And hence all these numbers scale.  For example, there is a vault whose auction got the full tab, so the system made its 13% off them, but they didn\u2019t get collateral back. So you could argue that the system has already made 13% off of several people. Just take the differences with the last two columns. It\u2019s up to you to choose whom you\u2019re trying to make whole.   And that\u2019s it, you go through the data, and you decide what you think. You can debate what you think the value of the ETH was at the time, and what you want to do about that. I did this only for ETH because it was already pretty time-consuming. I was looking at the data before I even had an idea I was going to have to report this. I was just curious about it. And this finally evolved into this report, and try to get as much data as I could pack into it and then do what I could with my spreadsheet versus what I need as a database. A database I can do queries on, and pull this stuff out, and do graphs, and everything is just cleaner and simpler. I just don\u2019t have those tools. So this is only the compensation report. You guys can look at it, Debate for yourselves what you think about it. I kind of frame the poll percentages. I made these 5% marks. 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 25-25, above 25, should you want to have that option.  Because when you look at zeroes, you\u2019re saying \u201cno, not giving you nothing, you should have known better,\u201d 0-5 is like \u201cmmm, I think we should give them something, because they could have done better, but not that much,\u201d 5-10 is \u201cmmm, a little more than not-that-much, but not quite even half of what you think theoretical is.\u201d 10-15 is \u201cah, half the theoretical.\u201d then you go above that, for different reasons, and they all seem to be kind of clear framing. I think I make a post on this in the forum.   You can do different things with these buckets, but it was my suggestion for if we\u2019re even going to poll for compensating. You kind of want to look at no and yes, and if it\u2019s yes, then \u201chow much?\u201d and how you figure out that as a percentage that you can then put to the full group as \u201calright, let\u2019s approve 13.48%,\u201d or whatever the number is. The polling, someone else will handle it. I put that in the forum as a suggestion. The rest of it is just \u201cthank yous.\u201d This report could have errors; please audit it. Eventually, I\u2019ll release my dataset; I\u2019m paring stuff away that doesn\u2019t need to be there, because I have a lot of excessive stuff in my spreadsheet for other reasons, and then references.  49:42  Rich: I\u2019m going to use that as a segue to thank you, MakerMan, for all the work that you put into this. The main takeaway for me is that there\u2019s a lot of data that needs to parsing. This is the starting point, I feel, for the community to begin to solidify around a solution, around a target for ourselves, so this is exciting stuff.  MM: One more minute, Rich, to make a pitch to the community. So I just want to say, officially, Rich paid me 4,000 Dai for this report. It\u2019s kind of as-is, my work, I consider it done, and releasing the data kind of finalizes it for me. But I want to put those 4,000 Dai up, against like 10 for 1, and I want to raise some money to make an independent analyst group for Maker. So if anybody is interested, I\u2019m willing to do that. I can give an address, and I think that if we can do something independently, raise some funds, get people working on something and do it independently somehow better, I think it would be great. And I would like to manage such a group, to work on analysis and help you guys out. Just an idea, you can contact me by email, it\u2019s in my report. That\u2019s it. Thank you. Rich: That\u2019s amazing and super-generous. I appreciate that. We\u2019ll figure something out. The Foundation is enormously interested in bootstrapping initiatives in the ecosystem, so obviously we take arms lengths, people are doing some cool stuff, and we want to help them to do that cool stuff so that we will figure something out. There are grants programs and lots of other programs. We have resources we can bring to the process. That\u2019s a great recap, thanks again for all the work that you put into it. I encourage the community to jump into that forum thread and internalize this information. Take a look at those recommendations, and not only talk about the compensation issues, but let\u2019s continue the discussion on the improvements to the auction mechanism. In the sidebar, there are lots of really fresh ideas that need capturing somewhere, so I encourage the side chat to add those to the forums as well.    Questions and Comments 53:24  Akash: Auctions are supposed to be last resort. Right? There should be a way. d I believe DeFiSaver has this, they\u2019re using flash loans on your current vault to unwind you before you get to the auction. That would save the user 13% of liquidation fees. Is everyone familiar with this? I think that should be promoted as a useful way to avoid the auction and paying 13%.  Rich: There are larger discussions here, and I\u2019ll frame it: why auctions in the first place? It\u2019s an interesting question. My understanding is that the protocol is looking for the most efficient way to handle price discovery, so obviously, auctions are an enormously efficient way of discovering price. The problem here is that people need to use auctions. So, these questions about increasing the agility of these auctions, the accessibility, and efficiency of them, versus additional ways to source liquidity. I know that lev is in the call, and I don\u2019t want to push him under this bus, but I know that lev has done some deep thinking into the auction mechanism, and he might be the person to speak to it. Akash: If you have a small vault, you should be using those tools to avoid the 13% penalty fee. But if you have a large vault, then you could not use that mechanism because you have had a gigantic price impact if you\u2019re automatically interacting with UniSwap and pushing the prices around. So if that user is using a large vault, they should not use that automated mechanism because you will end up probably losing more, and you should rely on the auction mechanism that Maker has. But if you\u2019re a small user, then you could avoid the 13% penalty fee by just using something like DeFiSaver, where it automatically unwinds you. I hope that makes sense, everyone. Lev: I generally agree with the thing that Akash said first. In general, this doesn\u2019t seem to be discussed enough, the CDP operator structure, and then it\u2019s just taken as a given that these auctions are going to happen, and people are going to be subject to the prices that they get in the auctions. When in reality, you could even make the case that no auction should ever happen because the user is going to be hit with this very high liquidation penalty already, even assuming that the auction goes very very well. The auction might not go that well. And even the most significant CDPs on the market, they should be able to get much less than a 13% penalty off-market for their collateral auction. You could say that no one should hold CDPs naked without any infrastructure that\u2019s going to avoid liquidations, so really an auction happening is a disastrous scenario where some technology has already failed before the auction has even started. And the auctions are not intended to get reasonable prices for users; they\u2019re a backstop to protect the system. There\u2019s an argument that the penalty should be 100%, in the sense that you never get any collateral back because you screwed up if you allow that to happen.  I\u2019m not proposing this as a policy right now. But I\u2019m saying that this is a valid perspective on the system, that the auction is essentially a piece of last resort infrastructure where the situation is out of the user\u2019s hand. There\u2019s no obligation to them anymore. I think it\u2019s imperative to develop and promote the development of CDP management infrastructure, whether that\u2019s these 3rd party services or smart contracts that you can delegate to, that rescue your CDP before it gets liquidated. Or maybe even services where you hire someone to manage your CDP for you. Or, if you\u2019re adventurous, software that will execute some trading strategies to self-liquidate your CDP under certain circumstances. All of those things, in my opinion, that everyone should be doing if you have a CDP. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to sleep, and you\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to wake up tomorrow, and all of my stuff will be gone because I technically screwed up,\u201d and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.   Rich: There\u2019s an expectation with the protocol that people need to actively and continuously manage their positions. lev: The message should be set by this very high liquidation penalty of 13%, which is saying essentially \u201cthis is not a handy way of liquidating a position, 13% is crazy.\u201d It\u2019s saying, \u201cyou really screwed up now, and we\u2019re trying to discourage this punitively.\u201d This is why I would say to Akash\u2019s last point that we need to make sure that there are solutions for large CDPs that can manage their CDPs before liquidation. I don\u2019t agree that the right thing for large CDPs is to let it go to auctions. You could get a much better price than that going over the counter to a market maker or going on many exchanges. Of course, that liquidity might not be atomically available on decentralized exchanges. Rich: You\u2019re talking about best-case scenarios. Would OTC or liquidity providers have saved people heartaches on March 12th? lev: Yes, you would\u2019ve been able to liquidate at any point on March 12th, probably any of these positions. Probably pretty nasty slippage in the grand scheme of things, but probably less than 13% and also definitely much much less than what they got, which was zero. Akash: I do want to add another point. For large CDPs, I don\u2019t know if people are correctly using all the tools available. We noticed a large CDP a couple of weeks ago went on Coinbase, bought a lot of Dai pushing the price extremely high. In my opinion, the correct sequence of events is: if you had a large CDP, you could go to the USDC vault, mint the Dai that you need, close off your ETH vault, and essentially now you have switched yourself to a USDC vault. Then slowly buy Dai and close that up, instead of aggressively pushing prices. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense to everyone. lev: I think this is a great point. I agree about the general point on not using the tools available. On this specific example, I would say that compared to CDP users that have gotten liquidated, that CDP user that you described was much more effective. If I remember correctly, they ended up paying $1.04, or $1.05, so a couple of cents premium over the market before that for getting that Dai, which is much less than the liquidation cost them. Also, with this USDC play, they would then be stuck with the stability fee for some time until they managed to close it up. It would probably be a little bit more efficient. Maybe you would save a couple of cents on Dai, but basically, everyone who\u2019s getting liquidated is ten times worse than that. So the low-hanging fruit to me is that no one should be getting liquidated, every liquidation should be examined as some kind of failure. Akash: I agree with that general sentiment. MakerMan: I wanted to echo that as well. The idea that we could have some sort of automated vault management. A liquidation protection system that people can buy. And maybe even 3rd parties can provide through the system or independently. The more, the merrier, but Maker should offer that service itself. However, I think that all solutions should be encouraged on that. I didn\u2019t get to look at that data, but what was clear was, out of the $45 million that was liquidated, roughly $13 million went through the Maker auction itself. The rest of it kind of self-liquidated out there in the markets. A lot of the stuff went through other places; it had to. I didn\u2019t even begin to look at that. That would be an interesting data point and then analysis as well. Because we got vault holders that are here kind of like \u201cHey, I self-liquidated vault 2288,\u201d he was the one that kind of nudged this a little bit. He was one guy that self-liquidated and got about 13% of his collateral back if I have him right. Every percent that we lower our fee, and they get more collateral back, potentially. It\u2019s an important issue to discuss. You have to have the right mechanics in the system. What that fee is, what you do with it, how you manage it. It\u2019s a whole different thing. I also agree with lev in particular that every auction is a failure for some participant. That is bad. It needs to be avoided. What I have it at, 120,000 ETH, out of around 2Million, I\u2019m guessing, and I don\u2019t have the exact number in my head at the time. But it was like 10%, 10-15%. It was pretty good for a 50% drop that we only ate through that much collateral. And I think it was due to these secondary agents kind of saving our ass, really. I think we can do better. So I agree across the board.    Analysis Vishesh The State of the Peg 1:05:05  1024\u00d7516 56.1 KB   First things first, I know we have the vote going through about the Dai supply, but the growth of the Dai supply has continued at the rate that we identified around the 19th. That uptick did continue precisely the same pattern. As called out, this is very likely to hit the 100 Million mark and appears to have been addressed now by increasing the debt ceiling.   1047\u00d7424 124 KB   What impact is that having? Why, why not? I know a lot of people had questions, with ETH pumping so recently, the question is, what\u2019s the impact on the Dai price? What we saw around the start of the 29th, we saw this price start to level out and come down a bit. Then, in that exact time frame, ETH continued its run-up. We\u2019ve seen this inverse relationship between ETH and Dai, particularly when ETH is volatile or crashing. When ETH is rising, and people have confidence in the continued rise of the ETH price, we generally tend to see a reversion of that behavior. There were a lot of trades at or below a dollar, right at that moment that ETH started to jump on the 29th. That makes sense because people are bullish on ETH when it\u2019s starting to jump. Potentially we see some selling of Dai and some purchasing of ETH, aka some leveraging behavior. The Dai supply has been increasing, and all of those behaviors kinds of adds up. As the ETH price continued to rise, then the Dai trades started to happen at a little bit higher price. We can break that down as to why, but I\u2019m also guessing there was a fair amount of market makers that maybe picked up a little inventory as soon as it dipped. That would make a lot of sense. Given all the events and all the volatility that happened prior, it would make sense for market makers to been cleared out of inventory. And this dip would have been an opportunity for someone to repurchase Dai at a reasonable price. We would love to talk to some market makers to get that data, but if that was the case, then it would push back the Dai price a little bit. The average is still kind of sitting at $1.015, but if we see some of the trades that continue to the trend more than 1.005 or at a dollar, then this average would naturally come down over the next 24-48 hours. That price reduction behavior would make sense with what\u2019s going on with the ETH, but there are certain combinations of market conditions where it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to come down. People are in the wait and see holding pattern with ETH itself, and I think that trickles down to Dai because Dai is exceptionally responsive to general market conditions, ETH in particular. I think we would have to wait and see what happens next. I wouldn\u2019t over-index on the current Dai price because this has gone up and down in the same 48-hour period, so that data is going to be a little bit screwy. You want to give it a little time to cool down to see what happens next. If anybody was getting alarmed because Dai is not coming down, again: I would just urge a little bit of patience to see what happens next, because ETH did just do a bit of a 180 in momentum, and I think that\u2019s going to be throwing off the market a little bit.   1061\u00d7515 128 KB   If a lot of that trading activity, when Dai dipped below, were purchasing activities, it might mean that there\u2019s a lot of people sitting on Dai that are waiting to lever up at the right moment. Given the ETH price just increased, that would mean that they\u2019re waiting for ETH to come back down. I think that\u2019s a fair point to consider here, is that I usually mention this \u201ceasy come easy go\u201d thing. If ETH price has jumped significantly in a short time frame, I think a lot of people and I would be wary of that and would not necessarily act on it and might just be waiting for that to potentially level back down before taking actions. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make a lot of sense that the Dai supply has been continually increasing over the last week or two but that the Dai price has not been continuously decreasing. Except if you consider that people have been minting that Dai but not necessarily selling it. And the reason is if they\u2019re waiting for a certain action to happen, stocking up on inventory to take some potential action, or they\u2019re just uncertain given the speed and frequency of ETH price changing, and they want things to level out a little bit before they take those actions. These are potential explanations of what\u2019s going on, but as always, we can only ever guess at people\u2019s reasoning.   1040\u00d7478 117 KB   Total Sai is down to 10.2 million. Total Dai is up. So that\u2019s resuming progress as normal, it seems, in terms of shutdown migration, etc. I know there are a lot of other threads in context right now on what happens when the Sai shuts down, so I\u2019m not going to touch that. The point in terms of the total supply out there is kind of resuming a more normal state, post-Black-Thursday events, so I think that\u2019s a good indicator.   767\u00d7115 34.7 KB   In terms of Dai from ETH utilization 98%, Dai from USDC there\u2019s 823,000 Dai from USDC, with the current debt ceiling of $20 million, so that\u2019s a pretty small bucket right now, and I think that makes a lot of sense given that it\u2019s the more expensive option at the moment. In addition to the emergency parameters and given the fact that there\u2019s not a huge need right now for minting and selling of Dai from USDC for auctions, liquidations, etc. Just to clarify some of the comments in the chat: there was an executive that passed to increase the debt ceiling. That happened rather quickly. I don\u2019t think there are any other relevant questions, but if I missed something, let me know.

These calls will begin to have more variety than they have had in the past. The three emerging segments for today are Governance, Risk, and Oracles. We are enormously interested in what the community has to say. Don\u2019t feel shy about participating in the calls via chat or video. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance  Last week Maker holders decreased the SF by another 2% to 16.5%, showing that Maker holders are willing to aggressively adjust downward in the interest of the Dai peg. The SF poll that ended right before this call successfully polled for another 2% decrease. On Friday, September 6th, an Executive proposal will be put up for this decrease. We\u2019ve gone over and covered two important mandates this month, the Risk Team and Interim Governance Facilitator Mandates. Now we will begin to examine Oracles, their management, and the responsibilities of Maker Governance in regards to them. If you\u2019re interested in any of the mandates, read through the forum posts below:  Mandate: Risk Teams Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators   There are Governance Polls currently active to ratify each of these two mandates.  Currently, an overwhelming majority of the community are voting yes to these mandates.   The Oracle proposals that are covered in this call will be published and made available for discussion in the forum in the coming days. I am hoping in the coming months, specifically the months directly following the launch of MCD, that we would find a couple of candidates in the community for the Governance Facilitator role.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 07:05   Governance at a Glance Thread New 3 point summary section, to better capture a quick snapshot of what\u2019s happening in governance  bszWBSk.png709\u00d7237 15.2 KB   Most active topics of conversation are around MKR vote delegation and the implications of MKR lending on Compound.  MKR as Compound collateral  Mixed conversation. It seems that some people are very worried, while others are not. This is an important conversation to be had. It\u2019s our responsibility to figure out how to deal with these things, because MKR lending is inevitable. It\u2019s up to us to figure out how to get ahead of it or how to mitigate against the risks of this behavior.    Vote delegation is not something we should be striving for  Discussions around vote delegation. How much time and responsibility should we expect from MKR Token holders? Would delegation be a net positive or net negative?    Is our goal more individual voters, or more MKR locked?  Our overarching goal is to bring people in to be more confident about the consensus we are gathering. Though it seems that there are two diverging tactics. One to attract whales, the other to attract signal from high-quality people. Seeing divergence in voting behavior between small and large holders when it arises is an interesting metric. Agreeing about the importance seems to be the most reasonable view.    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  We are currently running a final poll to determine what the on-chain poll should look like.    Oracles Nik Kunkel  Nik is the Head of Backend Services at the Maker Foundation. Has been with the Maker Foundation for about 3 years. Has worked on OasisDex, Proxy contracts, OasisAPI, and Oracles. This segment is regarding the recent Oracles V2 & DeFi Feeds blog post.  Oracles and Maker Governance 15:04   There is a lot to cover in terms of volume. This is just an introduction to Oracles in MCD, their management, and the fundamental pivot in strategy around them. Next week I can post the actual proposals to the forum, the community can dive deeper into details then. Oracles take off-chain data and make it available to be used on-chain. In MakerDAO Oracles mainly provide the prices of collateral assets. As Maker governance has successfully managed the peg, it\u2019s coming time to give over Oracles to Maker Governance. This presentation is to make you aware of what the responsibilities would be and how Maker Governance manages Oracles. I\u2019ve structured this into a set of four proposals.  nSU0WpH.jpg1298\u00d7936 170 KB   Part of making Oracles decentralized is giving the decision making power to MKR holders who participate in governance.  19:54: Proposal 1: The Oracle Governance Framework  rL4aU9t.jpg1656\u00d7833 279 KB   This is similar to the general Governance Framework in that it defines the processes by which governance should be run. It is a blueprint of the responsibilities and processes with regards to Oracles. This is a living document. The proposal can and will be changed. This is supposed to be a starting point.   One of the main jobs for governance in respect to Oracles is voting in Feeds and Oracles   Feed: an individual who is running a bot that is pushing price updates for an asset.  Oracle: a smart contract, on-chain, that other smart contracts can query for a price.  Oracles receive inputs from the Feeds and publishes the median value.   Governance will have to define criteria for Feeds and Oracles  What makes a good feed? Who would be a good feed? What makes a good Oracle? What Oracles do we want to run? We will need to define the rulesets for each Oracle we run. For ex: if we were launching an Oracle for REP, we would need to answer questions like, \u201cwhat exchanges are we querying? What asset pairs from those exchanges are we querying? How do we filter this data? etc.\u201d This also includes the governance processes for voting in feeds and Oracles, and voting them out. Defining performance standards for Feeds. Defining who deploys the new Oracles. Oracles themselves have several parameters that need to be configured (ie: sensitivity parameter, expiration, delay, quorum, etc.)    27:40: Proposal 2: The Oracle Team Mandate  Don\u2019t worry MKR holders, you are not alone. You will be able to manage Oracles by delegating responsibilities to professionals. This proposal is a way to formalize the role of the engineers and team members who are responsible for Oracles. The idea is to have multiple teams, as the responsibilities can be split up however MKR Governance decides.  pc877Y1.jpg1399\u00d7870 129 KB     Administration:  feeds crash, updates to the bots that feeds rune, notification about issues to feed providers, software updates, etc.   Technical development:  All of these tools need to be programmed. Ex: What if we added REP? In the tools you will need to specify REP pairs, Exchanges, Filtering/modeling mechanism to arrive at final price, etc.   The Oracle Team itself does not have special privileges to enact any changes. It is not an executive of governance.  Any special privileges will be doled out through governance if necessary. The base layer is the Oracle Team mandate. There is a minimum level of executive privileges given to those Oracle Teams, then for specific Oracle teams, further special privileges can be granted. I want to make sure the mandate doesn\u2019t come out of the box with some broad executive privileges.  wcx0Vsn.jpg1592\u00d7792 184 KB     The Oracle Team\u2019s job is to both to make proposals and to give context and guidance about those proposals.  Governance votes on these proposals. The Oracle Teams act as governance liaisons.   Oracle Teams are responsible for publishing a roadmap of what they are interested in doing. This roadmap needs to be ratified by Maker governance.  52:46: Proposal 3: DeFi Partner Feeds  TmuVtqF.png1387\u00d7898 101 KB   The first wave of Feed candidates are dYdX, 0x, Set protocol, and Gnosis. They have been working with us closely over the past few months. They are all already very integrated into our Oracles. Set was one of the first beta users of Oracles V2, using our BTC price feed. dYdX has been using Oracles V1 since day one. 0x has been using us as well for internal stuff they\u2019ve been working on. Gnosis has been using us for their DutchX protocol.  This is very much about bringing in the stakeholders who already use our Oracles to become Feed providers. If you can have an organization be both a user as well as a feed, where launching an Oracle attack will actually harm their own system, the more you lower the overall risk of a Feed attack.    55:09: Proposal 4: Oracle Incentives Restructuring  3Kcmj8h.jpg1386\u00d7852 122 KB   Repositioning Oracles as a business model in order to self-sustain their operations and in the process, increase their level of decentralization.  NUyuAnq.png1272\u00d7619 36.9 KB   In Oracles V2 our Oracles will have a whitelist that regulates who can read the prices from that Oracle. If you want to use an Oracle, you will need to be on any given Oracle\u2019s whitelist. This is a tool for Maker governance to monetize the Oracle infrastructure effectively. When we launch MCD, start growing Oracles, and as the Maker Foundation steps back from covering costs, it will become apparent that the costs are pretty high. Having this tool to recoup costs is beneficial. The whitelist can also be used for business development as well. For example a DEX out there needs Oracle prices for some margin product that they are creating. MakerDAO can say, \u201cWe will give you feeds in exchange for listing all your token pairs against Dai\u201d. There are ways to extract value from this that is not necessarily money.  ZizAsVY.png1438\u00d7687 83.3 KB    fxRflsR.png1600\u00d71339 188 KB   Whitelists create an incentive for MakerDAO to provide Oracles for non-collateral assets, which could provide a service to the greater ecosystem as a whole while creating value for MKR token holders. The payments would work similarly to how the buy and burn currently works for Stability Fee revenue. Data consumers would be burning MKR; that\u2019s how MKR holders see a benefit.  01:01:13: Proposal 4.5: Make whitelist access free for one year  sjPrzGl.jpg1574\u00d7865 237 KB   Giving free access for free for one year will ensure that we don\u2019t pull the rug out from any projects that use our oracles as infrastructure for their systems. Giving it away for free is also a great way to bootstrap the customer ecosystem, as it is friendly to new potential clients. This acts as an entry point for them to come into our ecosystem. Setting up a cost-barrier from the start is not the way to do that.  Questions   32:55: Have any details been released about how new Feeds can be added to an Oracle?  We have not published anything as of yet. We will publish some stuff next week. There will be a section in the Oracle Governance Framework that covers what it takes to be a Feed and how one might be voted in as a Feed, same for Oracles.    39:20: Does this new model require that we trust the Feed partners?  Pseudonymous individuals and Organizations have different game-theoretic properties. Trusting Feeds is inevitable, however, there is a way to minimize the risk of a Feed becoming bad. Currently feeds are pseudonymous individuals. In MCD the plan is to have both public organizations and pseudonymous individuals Public orgs are much harder to coerce, extort, and bribe because of their public reputation.  igjM7tn.jpg1702\u00d7854 193 KB    pgi5yXu.jpg1609\u00d7802 182 KB      46:30: For the inclusion of organizations as Feeds, will these arrangements span into the legal domain? Will contracts be signed? How official will this be on the legal front?  Organizations have more surface area in the legal world than individuals. There is more flexibility with organizations that allow for the minimization of risk, legal surface area is one example.    49:07: Are there guidelines provided to the organizations on how to prevent individuals within the organization from controlling the feed?  Yes, we will provide guidelines and requirements. One piece of guidance being the control of feeds through the use of multi-signatory keys.    50:17: In the new world, public orgs will know who each other are. Is there a risk or concern around organizational collusion?  We think this is a valid concern. One of the things you can look at is: what is the quorum for a piece of being information published? Is it 51% of the feeds being active? 75%? 20%? And what is the proportion of public organizational Feeds versus pseudonymous individual feeds?    Risk Vishesh Dai Analytics 01:06:08  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights on Secondary Lending Platforms (SLPs): 01:06:08   With the two relatively rapid drops in the stability fee, the borrow rates on Compound and dYdX have come down in parallel. Borrow rates on SLPs respond accordingly to SF changes to maintain a 1-2% discount for borrowers.  Qego5CN.png1872\u00d7850 106 KB   Borrow volume in the last week or two has risen slightly. dYdX more so than Compound. Part of this has to do with the fact that dYdX has a different use case than Compound.  VMEuUqQ.png1855\u00d7783 43.7 KB   Supply volumes have been consistently rising over the past couple of months.  ZwzQN7i.png1865\u00d7775 45.6 KB   Excess supply went hand-in-hand with increased supply levels.  mj8U6uP.png1884\u00d7775 50.6 KB   Utilization rate for compound is consistently between 70 and 80%.  5kldOLl.png1876\u00d7782 70.9 KB    Dai Supply: 01:10:22   Dai supply has been comparatively steady for a while now. There was a larger dip on August 28th. We saw large wipes, but no corresponding increase in supply on SLPs. It is likely that these draws were users capitulating on their leveraged positions. This happened at the same time as the ETH price drop below $170.  6uRmCKu.png872\u00d7531 146 KB   The supply dropped as people capitulated, but then we saw a small rise in the Dai supply, likely taking advantage of the lower SF and desire to leverage.  It seems like the two things cancelled each other out. Most recently more Dai has been drawn than wiped. So why is Dai price still up despite the SF being lowered? It\u2019s because we didn\u2019t see any substantial increase in Dai supply.   Collateral value has been steadily decreasing, measured in dollars.  qBTkb75.jpg1644\u00d7794 106 KB   Collateral amount in terms of ETH has been counteractive to ETH price. Most recently amount of ETH in the system has gone up.  Yiane4d.jpg1637\u00d7632 92.3 KB   No significant amount of liquidations recently. Trading volume is comparatively low. In the last 24 hours, 1.6MM of volume. Similarly, transactional volume is down as well. Probably due to less trading activity.  Yten9Wg.jpg1640\u00d7724 123 KB   The price has been hovering in the 1-1.02 range for the last 7 days. With 13.4MM in trading volume, which is lower than previous weeks.  R3fumVb.jpg1643\u00d7702 169 KB    Questions to Vishesh   01:16:24: Are we giving people enough time to react to SF changes? Is there any way to see the delay of the Stability Fee on the actual effect on Dai?  There is no way to determine specifically when and how much the SF affects the Dai price. You can see it as a sort of inertia that shifts the boat. Vishesh had covered this in the past, even in the last call. Generally, it\u2019s hard to isolate variables because we live in the real world, which is a landscape of dynamic variables. There was also the point that the SF is like a sensitivity parameter to Dai price, where the main effecting variable might actually be the movement of ETH price. Slowing the cadence for SF adjustments is something that the community will soon more aggressively to gather sentiment on.

Offchain entities can still read the Oracle smart contract. Offchain entity could be a person or a website. I don\u2019t really see this as a problem. These are not the customers we\u2019re going after. Even if someone queries the Oracle price and then rebroadcasts it to a new contract, no one will want to use the new contract because they would have to inherently trust the centralized entity pushing the prices.   Onchain entities cannot read the Oracle smart contract unless they are on the whitelist. It\u2019s not that the price is encrypted, merely that the variable is private and won\u2019t be divulged without passing through the whitelist check. The only thing we have to worry about here is how our Oracle price is being used by whitelisted smart contracts. We have to make sure that if they store the price inside of a storage variable then that variable must have access restricted (essentially be private). We can enforce this by requiring entities who want to be whitelisted to verify their smart contracts on Etherscan.   ",

We\u2019re continuing the momentum from Wouter\u2019s insights in the last meeting. Since our base layer operates as a technology company having a deep insight into the internal mechanics is invaluable. Especially the underlying governance contracts and security. Again, a reminder that governance is about to get more complex, and that complexity is reflected in the contracts. There is a purity in the rulesets in the contracts, but viewing the system through that lens (and by extension tooling available) is essential. So, we\u2019re thankful to have him here. Thanks to everyone for showing up, as always, place questions in the chat or speak up. Cyrus Pre-Launch Governance Migration Cycle 02:39   This might be a data dump, so interrupt and ask questions as you see fit.  4NOIjB5.jpg1520\u00d7759 155 KB   Migration risk recap  We have two sets of stakeholders SAI holders and CDP owners. SAI holders will be able to convert into Dai using a special migration contract. CDP owners can migrate their CDP\u2019s using the SAI from the migration contract to repay the debt. As long as there is Sai liquidity.  This requires MKR to pay the governance fee for your CDP. If you don\u2019t have any MKR, the migration contract will facilitate that purchase through DEXes in the back-end.   Our goal is to shepherd users over. Global Settlement/Emergency Shutdown will occur at some point, and we have time to figure out the specific mechanics of this.  wAINoPn.jpg1414\u00d7723 103 KB     There are a number of MCD benefits that will attract users to migrate. DSR, lower Stability Fees, improved liquidation structure, and support for new collateral types. Additionally, a suite of new security features: Oracle Security Module, Governance Security Module, Emergency Shutdown Module. More discussion on those next week.  mFi0WTf.jpg1500\u00d7707 112 KB   Considerations  The pace of migration: if this is too slow, it will cause issues for governance managing two Dai pegs and SF\u2019s. Negative ramifications for the DeFi ecosystem. Fairly evident why we don\u2019t want this migration to be drawn out. We need to think about a sweet spot for the speed of migration. There are also questions about knowing when to call the migration \u2018finished.\u2019 Not sure it will ever hit 90% or even 100%. Once we can agree on its completion\u2019 we can go to more standard governance cycles. Hope is that migration completes by EOY.  Cf5xZob.jpg1531\u00d7740 148 KB     Governance  Obviously, the overall mandate of Maker is the stability and integrity of both SAI and DAI. The risk team will publish a migration risk module. Parameters and justification for strategy. Entirely focused on safety and incentives. SAI holders, CDP holders, secondary borrowers, and lenders. Thinking about the supply shock and knowing that monetary policy is front and center. Will publish in the next few weeks and set up a governance poll for the community.  3CJ2bOK.jpg1571\u00d7809 106 KB      21:55: Collateral Risk Models  A general model is still on track for early November before launch. It gives the community time to digest and discuss. Definitely doable in a few weeks, but we aim to discuss the modules in December. We\u2019re expecting the real governance cycle to begin in January. Collateral specific evaluation reports will come out in December. Discussion about them will follow as part of the governance cycle I\u2019ve received questions about whether this is a problem or not, proceeding to launch MCD without them. My answer is that it\u2019s not a problem. What we\u2019re proposing is to maintain the status quo, much like SAI, with a heavy emphasis on monetary policy to keep the peg healthy. The point of the general risk model is to deal with a separate but important issue in comparison to the risk premiums. Since we\u2019re dealing with a potential huge supply shock. Accurate risk premiums take a backseat in exchange for a SF that is determined for the purpose of safe migration.  I.E., if we came out and said ETH is a super-safe asset and only needs an SF of 3%, that would create chaos. It would affect the ability of SCD holders to refinance and destabilize the peg. The resulting monetary policy would converge those spreads. The point is that focusing on monetary policy is almost certainly the right course of action for the next few weeks.   Planning on launch with ETH, BAT, and SAI. BAT had 100% in the priority poll as the no. 1 selection. REP & ZRX were considered, but both are going through token-economics changes. REP might be a brand new contract token migration, ZRX is implementing new features too. It didn\u2019t seem like a good use of time to do the evaluation reports, given the imminent change in a few months. Qualitative analysis of BAT is being evaluated on contract by an independent risk analyst, so that is the first foray into potential decentralized risk teams. Reached out to professional crypto research teams as well, and they\u2019re interested in evaluating other assets. The rest we can delegate to other teams.  3gDBtaa.jpg1482\u00d7695 117 KB      33:49: Hypothetical Migration Cycle Risk Parameters.  DSR would depend on the type of Migration we think we\u2019ll have. The higher DSR, the more incentive to switch over. The 2-5% range is being talked about. ETH stability fee is a trickier one to pin down. We see a situation between SCD SF and the Compound rates where there is a 2.5% refinancing incentive that\u2019s lasted a few weeks without being closed. Hard to pin down CDP owner\u2019s incentives here, so we\u2019ll do additional research. We had floated other collateralization ratios, but we\u2019ll revisit that later. For SAI, one thing we\u2019re thinking of is liquidity provisions and enough room in the debt ceiling for the migration. Especially thinking about secondary market migrations. One other option is to lower the SCD debt ceiling gradually. Keeping a lid on that growth again. For BAT, the initial parameters are roughly a match for the order books on BAT. We\u2019ll expand in the forums on that.  X395p79.jpg1503\u00d7731 148 KB     Governance Contingency Plans  We need to remain agile and nimble, not our best traits historically, but we could improve. One idea is to increase the cadence of calls, thinking of ad-hoc to hold them as we need. If the community says so, we can do twice a week. 48-72 hours after launch, we\u2019ll need to convene to discuss and monitor what\u2019s happened so far. Moving forward, we\u2019ll need to be available more often for public calls. Also, there is a possibility of emergency Global Settlement; we need to be prepared for the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d and keep them in the back of our minds. That cadence is something we can come to a consensus on together.  OjiY1yG.png1104\u00d7709 83.6 KB     Governance and Risk Roadmap  Questions 11:23    11:22: Have we considered incentivizing early migration with MKR?  Cyrus: We\u2019re not paying SAI holders to migrate. There are several ways to have subsidized migration. Rich: Cyrus and I have been wrestling with this. We have a few sets of incentives available for us, and it\u2019s unknown right now what the appetite is for migration until it actually starts. Until the migration process starts, we don\u2019t know how much pressure needs to enter the system to ensure an orderly migration. Reasonably sure we won\u2019t have to pay people to move, but it\u2019s a possibility. Cyrus: We spoke about this last week, but it is more of a business decision from the MKR community.    13:15: Mentioned sourcing MKR\u2019s liquidity from DEX\u2019s, which ones?  Cyrus: Mainly Oasis but also an open-sourced arbitrage bots that will be released that sources liquidity from Uniswap and possibly other DEXs as well.    14:05: Why not use Uniswap as the primary outlet for trading on the back-end since it\u2019s the most liquid market?  Going to defer to market makers, but they are planning on providing liquidity above their standard level. So there should be better liquidity provision on Oasis. Some CDP\u2019s have higher than average MKR governance fees to pay back. We considered the liquidity provision from a slippage perspective; for these instances with significant trading volume, it makes more sense to use a limit order book. Rich: We\u2019ll have both open source tooling and the Oasis DEX available. JoeQ: There are also concerns about front-running on Uniswap. We need to be really careful with price manipulation, so that\u2019s why we decided to use an order book with bids & offers. Our recommendation (for larger CDPs) is sourcing MKR over multiple markets. Reducing slippage, and also considering migrating in chunks rather than all at once.    16:55: If there is 20% of SAI locked in DeFi, if the DAI stability fee crashes, I don\u2019t think incentivized migration will ever happen.  In general, we are looking at stability fees, and we\u2019ll get to this in a few slides.    17:27: Alex Evans: For MKR holders, is any formal input required at any point in this process? If there is, where would it be?  Cyrus: There will be governance polls to coordinate strategy and source consensus form the community about what level of input they want. In my opinion, it\u2019s better to debate incentives, picking the best outcomes from the best parameters. Best to not get mired in debating numbers. AlexE: If I understand what you\u2019re saying, you want a set of strategies for the various stakeholders, you want to add that to the risk analysis and wrap it all in a governance poll. Rich: We don\u2019t have empirical evidence to look back at to then generate a plan that works. The name of the game is the same defaults, minimal parameters to bootstrap the migration process. Once the process has bootstrapped, then we can figure out how to increment or decrement the relative parameters. The options for launching this are extremely limited: the SFs stay the same, and the DSR is the smallest amount we could reasonably allow. We don\u2019t have an idea of what the migration process looks like and what the necessary incentives will be to encourage people to move. We need to tweak those post-launch and see what works. Not a lot of room for experimentation when we\u2019re kicking it off, and we\u2019ll discuss the strategy a lot on these calls.    20:44: Any conversation with Compound to phase out SAI?  Compound posted a short blog about their strategy. No phasing out Sai until Global Settlement occurs. We\u2019ll need to give the DeFi system significant time to adjust when that does eventually happen.    28:08: Are you planning to launch BAT as Collateral in MCD or just the investigation into BAT?  Cyrus: We are planning to launch with a BAT CDP. However, we\u2019ve contracted an independent risk analyst to do the proper assessment of BAT. We will start with some conservative initial parameters and will tune them after the publication of the assessment. LFW & AlexE: We haven\u2019t had a BAT yes or no vote. So let\u2019s say we publish this general risk model; we look at collateral specific evaluation for it and realize that BAT is not a good fit. Cyrus: Two points. 1. We want to test the system, so we need at least one additional collateral type. 2. Everything will have extremely conservative risk parameters for this special migration cycle and afterward. After the fact, we can manage things differently. Whether it would be awkward if that asset is evaluated negatively, we haven\u2019t really considered because our philosophy was that any asset could be included eventually, save for the fraudulent ones, but we don\u2019t expect to be in a situation where we would need to remove a collateral type. Especially since that one was voted on with 100% unanimity. That being said, what are our options: could we do a shortened analysis or speed up that evaluation to justify that? ETH is in the same boat; it\u2019s not been evaluated. What if the community comes back and says, Based on the report, they don\u2019t want ETH, it could be messy either way.    39:28: Ben: Say I have SAI in one contract, and I move SAI into DAI through the migration contract. So now, my DAI is collateralized by SAI. What happens when SAI hits global settlement, is that SAI now un-collateralized?  It\u2019s certainly not uncollateralized since the SAI is a claim on ETH. So, in that case, the DAI is collateralized by more ETH. Even before global settlement occurs because ETH backs Sai. Andy: SAI that is in the single SAI CDP is siphoned out as migration happens. By migrating from sCDP to mCDP, the SAI is taken from the migration CDP and used to pay down the sCDP. The DAI created from the new mCDP is used to pay back the migration CDP, so it balances out and nets 0. Ben: Got it ok. Cyrus: Emptying SAI in the migration contract before global settlement and lowering the debt ceiling will also help. In case there are edge cases of keeping SAI alive in the migration pool by putting SAI back into it.    Wouter Kampmann Full security overview MCD Security Roadmap blog post MakerDAO Bug Bounty Governance Contracts and the Security Roadmap 46:22   0wJ2iyx.jpg1593\u00d7698 112 KB   ZrteVNl.png1480\u00d7813 179 KB   Almost all of the contracts have finished formal verification. Three independent audits. Trail of Bits report is on the blog, and you can see all the issues. Nothing critical or high severity. We\u2019re working with Peckshield as well; they found one high severity issue, the details of which can be read in the report. \u201cRuntime Verification\u201d is building a high-level model of the business logic of the different contracts. Essentially, using formal verification methods to find mistakes in business logic, if there are any, making the verification more robust. That relates to the limitation of formal verification, which uses the local level, but it doesn\u2019t consider other contract interactions. That\u2019s why we\u2019re using multiple audits. Local-level wasn\u2019t found to have issues by either partner. But they did come up with some issues that are due to interaction between the contracts. With runtime verification, we hope to develop a formal verification methodology for contract interactions. Certora did a test run on our contracts, we didn\u2019t pay them, but they found the same issues from our other audits. They even independently reported them, which was nice. Bug bounty started in July. Three high severity and one critical found by a skilled hacker. We paid a 9k bounty. It\u2019s gone much better than expected. You can see disclosed bugs on HackerOne. Every three weeks, we have a partner integration call. Get them to look at MCD code and consider migration as soon as possible. We have a Kovan testnet for partners. Deployment correctness check improves every week. We are also refining threat monitoring.  y7I0ADR.jpg1504\u00d7826 143 KB   In looking at the issues, we found and the overlap of discovery across the different audits and programs, we had some interesting findings. The overlap gives us confidence that we did a good job of catching most of the bugs that are in the system. For example, the critical severity bug that we caught was caught by two independent audits and the bug bounty program.

Some of the changes are risky, and should be hard to do, while others are routine that should be easier to do. Another aspect of the system are the delays that help protect against attacks on the system. Root Module & DSPause: The Root Module is very powerful, just like in SCD, you can change almost anything in the system with it. The DSPause module is a new module to react if there is a malicious governance change. So now we have limits on both attackers and ourselves to go from Executive vote -> system upgrade. The Rates Module can bypass the DSPause. There are minimal changes you can do here, basically small moves on SF and DSR. This is where immediate reactions can happen. The Oracle Security Module(OSM) imposes a one-hour delay on the publishing of reference prices by the Oracles. If there is an attack on an Oracle, then it allows us to bypass DSPause, for the freeze function, since we only have one hour delay period to stop a fraudulent reference price. The Emergency Shutdown Module(ESM) allows a quorum of MKR to trigger an Emergency Shutdown bypassing DSChief. ES can be triggered through the root module by a regular Executive Vote. But, the root module needs to go through both the Executive Vote, passing the previous hat, and then the DSPause. So if you don\u2019t have the time for a DSPause delay, then a minority of holders can trigger the shutdown. The threshold to trigger an emergency shutdown is 50,000 MKR. This action also burns the MKR in the process, so there is no getting it back unless a redeployment of the system grants your distribution back to you. So collusion or a bug, then the incentive for honest holders is better to burn MKR instead of the attacking MKR since the new deployment would render previous MKR\u2019s value as moot.  5CQ0r4G.jpg1506\u00d7829 361 KB    Questions   01:08:45: To clarify, does ESM burned MKR get redistributed on redeployment if it was done for a legitimate reason?  Wouter: On-chain shutdown happens, and then it\u2019s off-chain governance from there. So it\u2019s up to the community on how to deal with it. It could be clear that there was a malicious attack, then the MKR owners who triggered ES could be reimbursed upon redeployment. Chris Smith: That would be an ad hoc governance action; there is no technical mechanism for \u201creimbursement\u201d or judging whether it is \u201clegitimate.\u201d    Vishesh Dai Analytics 1:15:35  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights: 1:15:35   jrVRQsz.png723\u00d7442 103 KB   DAI supply has been relatively steady at just over $85MM.  zGAvFgH.png725\u00d7441 82.4 KB   There was outsized collateral added to the system despite a lack of corresponding Dai supply growth.

General LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 01:20:35   Governance at a Glance Thread Generally, the forums have been relatively quiet. Most of the recent activity was around Cyrus\u2019s status update on Risks.  Cyrus: Please come online and give us your feedback on BAT. LFW: The only thing that could be bad is launching BAT with MCD and then deciding later that we don\u2019t like it, knocking the debt ceiling back to 0. David and Cyrus: Not truly \u2018bad\u2019 more of an exciting experiment. LFW: Fair. The point was if the risk assessment comes back saying: \u201cThis is terribly risky\u201d\u2026 Rich: Isn\u2019t there no set of parameters that are too conservative? So, ultimately, if an asset makes it in, then the worst characteristic is that it doesn\u2019t move the needle. Cyrus: Presumably, someone has to come in and say \u201cthis is not a scam\u201d before the launch, so that\u2019s a stop-gap solution; a mini analysis, for launch, that puts any concerns to rest. Our strategy was to space things out accordingly while, at the same time, balance the engineering and safety aspects of testing new collateral types. That\u2019s the feedback I\u2019m soliciting.

My name is LongforWisdom; I\u2019m one of the Governance Facilitators. We have a fairly short Agenda. Governance at a Glance from me, Sourcecred trial update with Seth, Mariano from Smart contracts will talk about removing the last of Sai from MCD, Charles St. Louis will give us a MIPs update, we\u2019ll have the governance facilitators doing the governance poll review, then we have Vishesh with the State of the Peg, and finally we\u2019ll finish off with a general Q&A session as we usually do. As always, discussions happen in the Forum.   Governance at a Glance It\u2019s been moderately quiet this week on the forums. Not too many active discussions. Lots of engagement in the liquidation system redesign thread. Fairly recent threads include:   Bounties & Grants to improve governance and MKR protocol  Freiza talks about bounties and grants and some suggestions of how it can look like for MakerDAO.    Soft Locks and Future Guidance: A Pre-MIP Discussion  Akiva posts a pre-mip discussion soft committing to keeping risk premiums and parameters static (absent of specific conditions changing), which I thought was an interesting discussion to consider.    A Liquidation System Redesign: A Pre-MIP Discussion  I encourage anyone with ideas and insights on the redesigns to participate here.    Seeking Signal   Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium  The WBTC signal poll attracted a lot of attention and votes, which is fantastic. I would generally say, please do vote. If you haven\u2019t voted, please vote for the leading option if you find it acceptable. We want as much consensus as possible on the risk parameter changes too. Currently, 20 million debt ceiling is leading the vote with 52%. For the Risk Premium: 2% is leading with 47%. The 2nd leading option is \u201cletting the risk team decide,\u201d which is interesting. Let\u2019s take a brief moment to discuss this for a moment. We can spend 5 or 10 minutes.    Discussion 1 4:14  Cyrus: I think there\u2019s a complex situation with the debt ceiling. I know it\u2019s a little difficult to quantify risk around Bitcoin. I know there isn\u2019t a good framework evaluating custodial centralization risk. It\u2019s potentially not doable or at least requires legal opinions. We\u2019ve seen a few legal analysis by community members but generally doesn\u2019t seem like anybody is willing or capable of taking a strong stand. We can say what the effects would be if things go very wrong. The edge case here is that some asset\u2019s entire debt ceiling could be absorbed as bad debt into the system. We saw bad debt absorbed into the system as a result of Black Thursday with five or so million dai paid back. So, this is an issue we have with WBTC, USDC, and any other future centralized collateral types we are putting into the system. That\u2019s why there is hesitation on my part to raise the debt ceiling. Additionally, what are the incentives and benefits of raising it? We are in a low rate environment. Stability fees are at 0-1%. Lots of carry trades(borrow cheap, lend elsewhere) going on in the DeFi ecosystem. It essentially amounts to a subsidy of sorts from MakerDAO to the community in hopes of continuing to keep the Dai peg close to $1. It is interesting to see what the wrapped bitcoin demand would be. I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to happen or when we will get there. I think this needs a careful balancing of trade-offs. Pros of increasing debt the ceiling are an increased dai supply and peg improvement. Despite the peg being close to $1 it still needs a lot of supply to come in to push it below that $1. Regarding adoption and growth, I think market makers would love to see the debt ceiling increase to allow them to make various trades in the DeFi ecosystem. But here are downsides; In the absence of anyone from the community to come in and make a strong argument as to why we should raise the debt ceiling from a perspective of centralization risk, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s such an automatic decision. With ETH, if we hit cap, there\u2019s leeway of raising it because risks are constrained to the price risks rather than the additional credit risk to worry about. My minimum ask is to be cognizant that the risks of WBTC are different than ETH. If the community still wants to raise it, that\u2019s\u2019 totally fine. There are interesting ways to do it in a safer way. Cyrus: One idea is to add a second WBTC vault with a higher liquidation ratio of 175 or 200% and add another 10 million DC there. The second option is to increase the current DC but also start to aggressively increase the stability fee, almost like a utilization rate penalty. So if we increase the DC from say 10 to 20 million and increase the stability fee a few percent and so on. This doesn\u2019t really have the intended effect we want, which is worst-case loss protection. But, on average, it does provide additional compensation to the protocol. I would love to hear from other people.  Joe: We got to get this moving. Having KNC and ZRX Vaults will help out, but other people are taking bigger risks than us. Tether being the big thing at Compound. For us to increase by 10M with 4% SF on WBTC\u2026I think we can increase to 5-7% and people will still use that. The chances of default are very small.    11:20  Cmooney: A big change for me was that WBTC.cafe went live. It is a very easy way to flip between WBTC to RENBTC and go back to the ren bridge. This mitigates some of the concern I had around liquidation and the available market depth to handle that. It\u2019s not perfect. There isn\u2019t enough RENBTC in the bridge to handle what we have in WBTC, but it certainly lessens the concerns at least from a liquidation perspective.  CY: Here\u2019s a question; If this is pure BTC with no trustless bridge, If ETH debt ceiling is 100 million, then the Bitcoin DC can be significantly higher than that, does that mean the community is okay with having 150 million of WBTC? I agree that the risk is small, but it\u2019s not zero. That would be a better signal request in my mind. Specifically that risk, rather than what we think the debt ceiling should be. Cmooney: Any BTC we get on Ethereum is not going to be as risk-free as ETH. So were going to have that calculation in there. The decentralized bridges may get so good and baked in to trust it more and more over time, but I think you are right to call out the centralization risk and that it\u2019s hard to quantify. JoeQ: Do we charge for that risk? If we take the risk and put say 30M, the default should have interest rates at about 7-8% because the overall market is around 9-10% right now. CY: Compensation for risk through the stability fee doesn\u2019t compensate for the exposure risk. It\u2019s not like we can have an uncapped debt ceiling so long as we increase the stability fee because then MakerDAO as a whole becomes susceptible to the risks of a single collateral type. If there\u2019s a plan to get dozens or hundreds of collateral types into the system, they are all likely to have smaller debt ceilings. We can consider increasing the few we have now with the plan to bring them back down into proportion once other Vaults are added to prevent a balloon and exposure risk scenario. My concern is that even if we charge something high, having that single point of risk can take down the whole system. Cmooney: Risk premium off WBTC will help build the surplus buffer. If the entire thing evaporated, we take a surplus buffer hit, but over time we have an insulating layer. March 12 blew our surplus buffer; therefore, we need to build it up again. It\u2019s not an ideal situation. While increasing the stability fee doesn\u2019t remove the risk of collateral disappearing, but over time it can help mitigate that risk. But this is a tricky situation.    16:38  Greg: Do we know if WBTC is covered by BitGo\u2019s insurance policy? Is the hundred million in insurance coverage for individual asset holders?  Kairash: Yes, it\u2019s 100M per wallet and insurance up to 100M. If over that, we distribute multiple wallets. But if there becomes any other reason to use a single wallet, we can cheaply increase that 100M limit. Greg: Are vaults covered under insurance for theft? Kiarash: Yes, for the BTC in WBTC but no for anything outside. Greg: Cyrus, so isn\u2019t this the risk we\u2019re trying to compensate for? Cyrus: There\u2019s other non-theft counterparty risk. Let me reiterate. My stance is that if this is the will of the community and goes through governance, it\u2019s workable. It gives me pause when thinking about whether a debt ceiling increase is something automatic like the ETH ones. I just want to highlight that there\u2019s an additional class of risk here that is difficult to reason about and that we should be conscious of the fact that being compensated by an additional 5% stability fee doesn\u2019t compensate for when we have to absorb the entire 20M DC through debt auctions. If we can agree to that and be aware, then okay. Cyrus: One other aspect of WBTC: MakerDAO is housing 2700 out of total 4100 WBTC in existence, 66%. This is quite high, and the redemption risk during market chaos becomes a concern, as well as it could impact keeper liquidity.    19:22  Elijah: Question about the quoted 10% figure for centralized BTC borrowing. Is it for uncollateralized debt?  Cyrus: That 10% number is random. Somebody posted it in chat, but it\u2019s not a hard rule. Elijah: That would be a steep stability fee because collateralized debt is around 3-5%, but I just question the 7% figure. Joe: He is correct. 3-5% would be correct for collateralized debt.    Smart Contracts Mariano Conti SCD Shutdown 22:32  Starting last month, after SCD shutdown, we still need to do a little bit of housekeeping, just a bit of smart contracts work to zero out some states in the smart contracts. We\u2019ve made this public at github.com/makerdao/spells  We\u2019ve discussed this in the forums, and everybody is ok with it, so my idea is to put it up for a vote tomorrow along with whatever else needs to happen with the executive. If I understand correctly, there\u2019s nothing else to do, but I would still like to get the go-ahead to do this.  LongForWisdom: Yes, I think it\u2019s fine. We have discussed this in the forums, and no one seems to object strongly. If, for any reason, MKR holders oppose it, they can vote it down, so this is mainly informing people that it would be in the next executive, so they\u2019re not surprised.    Relevant Links Forum Thread: Removing Sai from MCD completely Community Seth Benton Sourcecred Trial Update 25:20 1321\u00d7719 156 KB  What you see right now is an instance of SourceCred, which is an open-source protocol for valuing, measuring, and rewarding open source contributions. SourceCred is doing a trial with MakerDAO, where we are scoring contributions on the Maker Forum. The Foundation is distributing right now 5 thousand dollars worth of Dai, according to Cred scores. So $ 1,250 a week now.  739\u00d7718 147 KB  Every Monday, we are posting the Cred scores for the week and distributions. Here we can see some scores, if anyone has any ideas or questions on how this data is presented, please let me know, and that is something that we can evolve.  1321\u00d7719 156 KB  And to go back to the instance here, I will do a quick tour through the UI. I also want to let you know that SourceCred is undergoing a redesign of the UI right now. There is going to be something much better here in the next week or two, so I won\u2019t spend too much time on this now. Here you can see the Cred Scores over time. The default is by users, but you can also sort it by topic or posts. You can also look at the post that got the most Cred for a given week. Since my screen is going slowly, I won\u2019t go into that too much. You can go in and change the default weights of the system. I can link to some documentation on how to do that as well.  964\u00d7542 322 KB  LongForWisdom: I find that messing with the weights of the algorithm is pretty interesting. To see how it affects Cred scores generally. There are different sliders to control how much Cred flows from different nodes. How much Cred flows from a topic to the person who made the topic, from people who liked things to the thing they liked, that sort of stuff. It is quite interesting to look at the default weights that have been used, fiddle with them, and potentially see if you can figure out a better configuration of the weights that leads to a cred distribution that you think better matches people\u2019s contributions. Seth: Absolutely! We have put a considerable amount of thought into the default weights, and we think it works well out of the box, but there are certainly better configurations for Makers. I encourage everyone to put up the weights, and if you can find a better configuration that gives a better reflection of reality, let us know. We are totally open to tweaking them to optimize them.  1440\u00d7900 182 KB  So here are some observations from the trial. Here there is a chart of the cred distribution overtime for the whole lifetime of the forum. As you can see, this week, it is dropping off. This is not surprising because the peak here is basically Black Thursday and all the activity around that. I am expecting this to bottom out and then form a baseline that we can use to select a more accurate measure of the effects of SourceCred. The main metric we are looking to optimize for is the engagement on the forums: getting more people to engage.  1440\u00d7900 172 KB  Some observations from the first two and a half weeks since the trial has been going. First of all, no overt gaming, which was great to see. Not terribly surprising because the Maker community is relatively small and high trust. We will definitely be digitally monitoring for gaming, but none so far. We have 13 opt-ins. Also, a reminder that you do need to opt-in to the trial. I will post a link with instructions on how to opt-in. Basically, you just need to e-mail me with the Ethereum address to send Dai to. We are seeing a few interesting edge cases that we didn\u2019t see internally at SourceCred. For instance, some scores are artificially high because there is a quirk where if the contributor comes in and contributes a lot of value and then disappears without liking or engaging with other content, then Cred gets trapped in that person\u2019s node, and they have an artificially high score. We don\u2019t see that as terribly problematic because there is not too much money being diverted from that, and we also have a refactor of the algorithm in progress which is going to fix that problem, which I will talk about in a minute.  1335\u00d7751 164 KB  I will finish with a brief roadmap of what SourceCred is up to. As I mentioned, we have a new UI in progress, which should be a lot better than what we have right now. It will, for instance, allow you to drill down into any contribution and see where that contribution got its Cred from. It works similarly with users. That should allow us to better understand Cred flows and also to debug and detect gaming if that is going on. SourceCred is complicated! We know that, and we are working on better documentation so that people can better understand how SourceCred works. If anyone has any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me on the forums. I am happy to answer questions and point people in the right direction. We are working on some data visualization analysis, which will take the form of tools that we can provide to the Maker community. I am also planning to start doing a little bit of analyses and posting results in the forum. If anyone has any kind of data analysis or data visualization ideas, I am all ears. And then, as I mentioned before, we are doing a refactor of the algorithm, which is called CredRank. This won\u2019t actually change the basic scores or anything. It is more of an optimization that will give us more flexibility. We will get rid of our little problem with Cred sinks and allow us to do more data analysis and make it work faster, etc. Of course, there is a lot more going on in SourceCred, but I don\u2019t want to spend everyone\u2019s time going into it here. Also, Maker customizations. One thing that I have been talking to LongForWisdom about doing is potentially minting Cred based on trust levels in discourse, which would allow us to prevent certain types of gaming and give us a little bit more civil resistance. It could also prevent people from getting Cred, for instance, for showing up just to submit their coin to get accepted to MakerDAO. Even if it doesn\u2019t get accepted, they get Cred for that, and we want to avoid that. We are also looking at the possibility of minting Cred based on categories or tags. Which would give us a lot of flexibility to incentivize specific things. For instance, the activity category would potentially incentivize certain governance actions. It\u2019s pretty exciting, and we are looking to experiment with that in the coming weeks.  34:341336\u00d7751 253 KB  Finally, engaging SourceCred. Feel free to ask me questions in the forum; I\u2019m here anytime. Here is a link to our discord, and we have actually created a MakerDAO chat channel just with Maker specific stuff. If you want to dig deeper or ask questions directly to the team, there is the website. We also have a community call every Thursday at 11 am PT on our Discord, and that is a great place for anyone to drop in and just learn more about SourceCred or asking questions. And that is all I have. LongForWisdom, is there any time for questions?  Discussion 3 35:41  LongForWisdom: Yes, we can spend a few minutes of some questions now. We have a couple on the side chat. Andrew Dawson asked, \u201cIs there a plot of the distribution of the weekly disbursements?\u201d  Seth: I think I know what he means. All we are doing right now is publishing an observable notebook, which just lists the scores. But I can definitely create a little chart of the Dai distributions of scores over time. And if you are just looking to look at the scores that are in the current UI, you can see that.    36:21  LongForWisdom: Another question was: \u201cWho is responsible for determining the incentivization structure for the forum engagement via SourceCred, e.g., texts, actions, contents.\u201d The question is for me because the answer is essentially me and Rich and the SourceCred team. In the trial stage, we are interested in trying out different things and figuring out what could potentially be viable in terms of what we would want to incentivize long-term through giving more weight to specific tags and other configurations. That is something that would need to be decided by whoever the funds from incentivization came from, which ultimately if everything goes well, should be the Protocol. So ideally, it should be the community deciding what specific things are incentivized. Whether that is discussion around MIPs or engagements with risks reports from Cyrus\u2019s team, smart contracts things, or anything really.  Rich: To follow up a bit, the first month is prototyping, testing, and looking for red flags. But at least my personal hope is that the community engages with SourceCred and the team directly to determine for themselves what activities they think are beneficial for the ecosystem. Part of why I find this experiment so compelling is that we will be able to directly interact with the community to figure out what kinds of activities the community wants to incentivize as well. That is why we are extremely interested in having anybody who has some thoughts to engage with us in the forum and help us shape the experiment.

                    "content": " MIPs  Charles St. Louis  Weekly Update 38:40  This week\u2019s activity  The monthly MIPs governance poll was submitted for the six proposals that passed the inclusion poll stage. This includes  MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding MIP13: Declarations of Intent   There were four polls that went out for whitelisting oracles:  DeFi Saver on ETHUSD Oracle DeFi Saver on BATUSD Oracle DeFi Saver on WBTCUSD Oracle MCDEX on ETH/USD Oracle   There were eight polls that went out for pointing and proposing new light feeds; More specifically for Kyber, Infura, EtherScan, and Gitcoin. If Nik is here, he might want to add some details about what these polls entail and what the next steps are for these are if they all pass the governance polls.  Nik Kunkel: Sure. The next steps are for the whitelist. They will get bundled into an executive vote. We need to make a change in the whitelist to add them in. For the light feeds, it\u2019s a little bit of a long process because we now need to have all the projects that got voted in to have them set up and configure their feed. That process will probably take under two weeks. We will probably get started with that this weekend, and then they too will get bundled into an executive vote, which will be held on June 26th, I believe.   Today we will do the Governance Facilitator Review of the polls that passed. The MIPs Governance Poll passed, so the Executive Vote will proceed if the Governance Facilitators confirm yes on the outcome. That vote will go out this coming Monday, June 21st. I do want to note that the executive votes for MIPs do have an expiration of 4 days, after which they will have no effect, so the proposals would move to the accepted status if the executive vote is included and passed within that 4-day limit. If the executive fails to pass within that limit, the proposals would have been officially rejected.   Next week\u2019s activity  Next Thursday, the Governance Facilitators will perform the Governance Cycle Review as part of this meeting, and summarize and discuss the results of the past governance cycle with everyone on the call. The meeting is also an opportunity to discuss the upcoming governance cycle and any potential submissions for July\u2019s governance cycle. Just a note about the July cycle. Even if it is a couple of weeks away, I want to note that the formal submission period does end on July 8th. So if you have any proposal\u2019s in progress, submitting them for review sooner rather than later is definitely a good idea.   Collateral Onboarding  The two governance polls to onboard KNC and ZRX have successfully passed. They will proceed to an Executive vote at the end of the week, on Friday, June 26, along with the other polls that Nik mentioned.   Community Greenlight Polls  Community Greenlight Polls will go out next Monday on June 22nd in the final week of this governance cycle. If the amendment MIPs pass this month, the community greenlight polls will start on the third week of the governance cycle, ending at the end of the governance cycle instead of carrying over to the following month, like currently. This month\u2019s Community Greenlight Polls are for:  LEND MATIC PAXG LINK ENJ WKT     New Activities in the Forum, MIPs subcategories  The Proposal Idea category was created last week. This is a place where you can propose your ideas for improving the Maker Protocol, technical, governance-related, or whatever. The first post in there was the pre-MIP discussion for the redesign of the Maker protocol liquidation system. The discussion is still going very strong. I do encourage everyone to take a look when they have the time. There are three other posts in the Proposals category, which is awesome to see:   Soft locks and future guidance  Akiva Dubrofsky: This pre-MIP discussion can go alongside some of the rate hedging mechanisms to provide more predictable financing agreements with MakerDAO, and that may help escalate the Dai supply. That\u2019s the motivation behind it.   Bounties & Grants to improve governance and MKR protocol Decentralized Maker broker     Polls and Votes Category  I\u2019ve created a read-only category for polls and votes, dedicated to providing more awareness and notifications of what\u2019s going on during the governance cycle, in terms of voting. It will be the go-to place to see the active inclusion polls, governance polls, or executive votes related to MIPs. Right now, it has the governance polls, and as of Monday, I will update it with the executive vote. That concludes the update today.   Break Week  LongForWisdom: I wanted to highlight that June\u2019s governance cycle finishes on the 28th. There\u2019s then one week when we don\u2019t do any MIP governance cycle things. We have like a week\u2019s break where we don\u2019t need to do MIPy things.   Relevant Links June\u2019s Monthly MIPs Governance Poll Results  Governance  LongForWisdom  Governance Facilitator Poll Review 46:18  I\u2019m looking at the governance poll for the MIPs monthly cycle. This included:  MIP13, Declaration of Intent Four amendments, amending MIPs 6, 8, 9, and 12 A sub proposal to ratify the Foundation risk team as an official risk team.   The poll passed, with 3,700 MKR, with 12 unique voters. I\u2019m not sure if this is less than what we had last week, but there was no MKR vote against it, so I don\u2019t see any reason to prevent this from proceeding to the executive. The executive that Charles mentioned will be live this Monday, June 21st.   Discussion 4 47:42  Cyrus Younessi: Did I hear correctly that there were only 3,700 MKR voting?  LongForWisdom: Yes, with 12 voters. I assume that the turnout was low because the prices are high, and the monthly cycle requires you to vote on the same thing three times, and this is the middle vote. So I\u2019m not terribly surprised that this is not attracting a huge amount of participation. I want to encourage people to vote, nevertheless.     Analysis  The State of the Peg  Relevant Links MCD system stats DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs  Vishesh Choudry 49:03  1284\u00d7592 122 KB   In general, Dai supply is pretty stagnant from last week. $106 Million from ETH, $525 K from BAT, 1.7 million USDC. WBTC still just near capped out, top of it's DC, at  9.99 million.   1304\u00d7629 161 KB   Here is the Dai price over the past week. Bit of dip and fluctuation in ETH price, though not large margins or swings. Dai price did rise as ETH fell. That rise against ETH is a pretty consistent trend. Especially in the past month, Dai snapped back into that tight negative correlation. ETH<>DAI trades spike rapidly above a dollar initially as ETH price fell. Pretty consistent, as I mentioned. ETH price recovered from the dip and Dai price stabilized, coming down again. These are tight fluctuations, although the last few weeks have had more ETH volatility. With ETH price cheaper than a week ago, Dai price is still a little elevated. ETH being cheaper now produces hesitancy in Dai holders to increase leverage, which is also a historically consistent trend. If people are unsure about what ETH will do, then they are unsure about how to lever up.   1321\u00d7688 192 KB   Looking at an order book perspective for DAI<>USDC trading. The trading price has leveled at $1.008, which is a small buffer above a dollar. Slightly less than what ETH<>DAI trading had indicated. Presumably, because there is a larger spread on ETH<>DAI vs. DAI<>USDC.   1283\u00d7638 55.6 KB   USDC Dai is flat at this low ~$1.7-1.9 million supply level.   1306\u00d7639 68.1 KB   BAT Dai is maintaining that half a million level, significantly down since March, yet stable.   1310\u00d7643 46 KB   WBTC Dai still at its DC cap, and I know we\u2019re discussing it in a few threads, so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.   1299\u00d7636 72.3 KB   One Dai from ETH, after that quick $10 million supply and burn, there was a dip going to $102 million, then recovering. Essentially, Eth-Dai has a general growth trend over time with little contrary data. There is no indicator that anything has fundamentally changed with Eth-Dai. All-in-all is pretty quiet.   Discussion 5 54:43  LongForWisdom: No questions, but Jiecut from chat asked: \u201cCompound effectively has negative rates because people can lever up on ETH to get COMP.\u201d So potentially people are choosing to lever up there compared to Maker because the rates are Zero.  Vishesh: There is a whole other thread about secondary markets. Essentially what we tend to see with secondary lending markets is a tight relationship with the relative spread between rates and what people refinance to and from. I do think that what\u2019s happening with COMP distribution lately can befuddle some of the numbers.     Open Ended Discussion  Discussion 6 56:33  Andy: Last week, Nik mentioned pushing through Oracle things in the weekly Governance Cycle, is that the reason these Oracle polls are down now or is it because we wanted the more traditional MIPs process?  Nik: The poll this week was to fix inconsistencies in MIP10 that we needed to fix. In the interim, while we refactor those, we wanted to use the short cycle. Andy: Cool, really awesome to see those come through. There are some fantastic proposals coming through. Nik: If you like that, there\u2019s more on the way. More light feed onboarding is a big priority for me personally, and it should be for the community. It further decentralizes the oracles, makes them more robust, and makes them more attractive for third parties. We\u2019ll see a lot more whitelisting proposals too. Andy: On that point, I think that it\u2019s well worth it to read Rune\u2019s response about liquidation process. He\u2019s consistently pointing people to MIP1 and problem spaces. He continuously discusses edge cases like OSM failures, for example. If we have OSM failures, then we likely have bigger problems with our liquidation system. Understanding a failure and what we\u2019d have to focus on as a Governance community. It would lead to more interesting conversations on this call. Nik: Couldn\u2019t agree more. LongForWisdom: If you haven\u2019t reviewed MIP1, I encourage people to look at it. It\u2019s the closest thing we have to a roadmap, at this stage, of what to complete before the foundation dissolves.    59:56  Charles St. Louis: Akiva asks, \u201cIs there a list of light feed oracles on GitHub or the forums?\u201d  Nik: Github MIPS repo, specifically component 17 is the best place to look. I would have to update this to include this week\u2019s polls. Currently, we should be at 24 total.    01:00:49  SamM: Currently, as we add more collateral and adding more oracles, it seems like it may be like a quadratically increasing function of those two components. I\u2019m curious about how to scale up to that massive number in the near future.  Nik: You\u2019d have to describe which part of scalability? Feeds, oracles, customers, performance, which aspect are you interested in. Sam: Feeds. The number of oracle providers and collateral that need feeds since both numbers are going up that looks to be a quadratically scaling number, which concerns me. Nik: OK. So in terms of the number of feeds, there are diminishing returns. They give better security in theory, but we pay feeds 1,000 Dai a month to cover their expenses, dev hours, maintenance, and monitoring. I think we\u2019re aiming to have in the short to medium term about 30 feeds.  An equal number of dark and light feeds seems attractive, even if all the dark feeds are civil, for instance, they wouldn\u2019t be able to reach consensus on any price. Same if there was a social media campaign, turn off sentiment against Maker, and all the light feeds came to a consensus to screw over Maker, they couldn\u2019t change the price either. It seems like an attractive position to be in. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to push at the moment. We shouldn\u2019t be adding just anyone or add low-quality partners. We should aim for the biggest players in the ecosystem. We need to be patient, so we can evaluate those trade-offs. In terms of oracles themselves, actual customers, with governance in place, everything goes much quicker. Now that we have specific dates to make things happen doing things in parallel can be rapid. It\u2019s only when you have to do them one-by-one you incur the largest time penalty. It\u2019s no more effort to whitelist eight versus one. I\u2019m encouraged by governance going smoothly until now and think we\u2019ll hit a good rhythm the more we do this.   Sam: So you want 30 dark 30 light and leave it there? Not increase it ad infinitum. Nik: We\u2019re at 15 dark feeds right now. Sam: So there is a cap a secure enough number, you don\u2019t want to keep going up? Due to cost? Nik: I don\u2019t presume that the number is 30; the community needs to weigh in on that. It seems like a good start considering we have 15 dark feeds. Matching with light feeds and doing 30 seems like a good point to hit and stop. We can evaluate from there if we want to add more light feeds or do we want to stop. Adding dark feeds is something a little complicated since they\u2019re anonymous. How do you evaluate the credentials of someone if they\u2019re anonymous? One of the details in MIP10 is what those requirements could be. If you\u2019re a large scale miner on a large blockchain, for example, you could sign a transaction on-chain. Verifying good standing for whatever blockchain securing, however much hundreds of millions or billions in value. We may want to explore other metrics, as well.

We\u2019ll be having these daily to discuss the rapid series of measures to combat market instability and risks.   We all know that one year in crypto feels like ten years in the traditional world. Real-world is moving at a fast pace, so we have to move even faster. With open governance, we need consensus, decision making, and signaling. But we also have to be agile to get things done.   This is an experiment in how governance happens when markets are frothy. Though this is a challenging series of lessons, these calls will serve as a learning experience for posterity. We\u2019ve already made decisions in the past week to strengthen the protocol, but, as we\u2019ve seen, nothing is permanent. We have the coming weeks to refine and review everything that happened over the past week to get things right.   Market frothiness has raised a few other issues, also agendas for post-mortems. The quick moves in the market recently accelerated several plans we\u2019ve had from the beginning. USDC was one of them, alongside discussing conditions for SCD shutdown. As the ecosystem becomes murkier, it\u2019s essential to understand these dynamics.

Questions and Comments 29:02   Rich Brown: You mentioned strategies for-profit motives, but what about altruistic bidders? Preventing low balling etc.  MA: If you want to be altruistic, you can bid with the market price. When auctions work well, the winner gets a few BIPS off market price.    30:01   Charlie: Is there a read-only version of this software? Rather than submitting a price model, it can just collect data?   MA: I haven\u2019t seen one, but I can\u2019t imagine it would be difficult to set one up. I\u2019m not aware of such a configuration at this point.   Andychorlian: There are sites like daiauctions.com that run that, but currently, I don\u2019t know of a setup that runs a script on a node. If there is enough demand, I can probably put something together.     31:15  Kentonpresscott: As a comment on the last slide, in terms of keeper bid-only settings to limit node and server constraint, the latest GitHub commit now has bid-only as the default option.  Governance and Risk Cyrus Potential executive vote to lower minimum bid on Debt Auctions 32:00   Flop auctions are beginning at approximately 10:30 AM Eastern this Thursday. If the system accrues further liquidation penalties, this time could push back. Due to yesterday\u2019s surge in liquidation penalties, it was pushed back from 6:30 AM to 10:30 AM. On the accounting side of the system, some of the bad debt clears out and the auction pushes back.   One of the critical questions that have been discussed is the starting price. The current structure is 250 lot of MKR for 50,000 Dai. While illiquid, the implied USD price is $200 per MKR.   That 200 number was chosen back in November during the MCD launch. Due to recent development, a massive crash in collateral prices could lead to a crisis of confidence in the amount of Dai. As a result, flop auctions were created to get bad debt out of the queue as soon as possible, 48 hrs after bad debt accrues. A 2/3rd discount was built into the system at $600 for the post-crisis MKR price was set to about $200.   We did not see that crisis of confidence in Dai. The Dai price has remained stable, reflecting the community\u2019s belief that Maker\u2019s long-term prospects are fine. There is less urgency to clear out the bad debt, so long as it gets cleared out eventually; which is partially why the extension from 48 hours to 6.5 days was suggested and passed.  Now, there is a case where if the MKR spot price is below the 200 Dai per MKR starting bid, then we may see no bids. In this case, the auction would be put back 72 hours(three days.) In this case, the price would drop from 200 to 166 Dai per MKR. The question is: should we propose a governance vote to change the starting price to avoid potentially pushing the auction back? Or do we want to keep it as is? There is an argument to be made that even if the spot price is below 200, due to illiquidity, the auction might stil clear just fine. An executive vote can be used to either increase the lot size or decrease the bidding amount such that the starting price is reduced a bit. We would need to do this before the auctions start this coming thursday(with a 4 hour governance delay.)      Questions and Comments 38:50   LFW: Any thought of decreasing the re-initialization delay?  Cyrus: That hasn\u2019t been discussed, but it is a good idea. The auction duration could be reduced, so it would only take a day or two to recycle if the price isn\u2019t optimal. Certainly, from a governance friction perspective, doing nothing is the easiest thing to do. A 4th executive vote in the last week is a lot. Will there even be a considerable difference in the debt auction if the starting price is 200 vs. 150 given that the public exchange spot price of 200 isn\u2019t significant when dealing with a quantity of 5 million Dai worth of MKR.    40:18   Rich: What are the risks of the various options? What happens if we allow the price discovery to occur past the intital auctions?   Cyrus: The most significant risk is branding/optics, as in debt sitting in the queue for longer than people would like. If the starting price for MKR is too high, then people can just wait three days, and that further increases uncertainty. There is no issue in lowering the bid price, but what should it be reduced to? Could it be $150 or even $100? We could even reduce it down to a single dollar.   I\u2019m speculating here, but we don\u2019t want someone to zero bid the debt auction in the case of a liquidity crisis, and MKR dilutes like crazy. The free-market approach says to start at a low number and let the keeper community do its thing. But for better or worse, the minimum bid tool is here.     43:25  Charlie Noyes (From Paradigm): We agree with Cyrus\u2019s point regarding not having to wait three days for the auction reconfiguration. I can see anxiety in the community regarding the debt, not clearing. I think we\u2019d be supportive of adding a margin of safety to minimum bid price or reducing the time for the spot price in going down to three days. Those aren\u2019t super strong feelings, but it makes sense optically. It is best for this debt to get out as clearly and cleanly as possible.  44:42   Emilainobonassi: A price reduction is an opportunity for speculators. If there is a reduction to, say $100, it could lead to people shorting MKR. If lowering the price could affect the system by introducing speculation, it may be better to reduce time delays instead of providing for more agile responses. This, to me, is a better signal than lowering a price.  Cyrus: There is no good rationale for lowering the price arbitrarily. We could drop to a dollar, but that could open us up to an attack. Some people may look at that approach as a free-market, but we should understand the risks involved in this decision.    48:30   0age(person talking for the backstop syndicate): From my perspective, regarding the backstop-syndicate, the risk is one sophisticated keeper mounting an account to steal collateral and execute malicious upgrades. A community of users that rely on Dai is stronger when there is less opportunity for attack. Regardless of where the auction price starts, a 100 Dai for 1 MKR is a good shelling point with broad consensus. Some people are trying to buy into Maker who are willing to pay, then some opportunistic people are trying to scalp Maker, and finally, there is the third group of people who just want to help.   Auctions that begin higher and then trend down is preferable. This gives those in the community without the capital and sophistication a chance of participation and contribution to the backstop syndicate. The real goal, in our case, is not to buy Maker but to make sure that Maker is sold. If more people come in at a higher price, it\u2019s a win-win. For us, if the price starts at $1, the idea is still to bid at $100.   There will be a hundred auctions going on at once. Our intention is signaling support for the Dai ecosystem and helping prevent a considerable chunk of Maker from selling at low prices and centralizing into a few hands. We\u2019ll go in whatever direction is decided. But I don\u2019t think it makes sense to have no one bidding if the spot price is not accurate. The thing that worries me about the time that the auctions are running is: if the ttl is being pushed out, then the auction compresses into a smaller window.   Cyrus: Another idea is the step size in between failed auctions. It is currently at 20%, so if an auction fails at $200, it would fall to $160. We can set the step to 50%,  aggressively lowering the bid price between auctions.   Cmooney: I think 20% is a decent parameter because it stops slippage. The three-day delay may not be great.     55:49  Nik Kunkel: Changing the auction model as a whole right now, as some are suggesting in chat, is not reasonable. Smart contracts are not something you can whip up overnight; we are constrained by the current auction model. We should be focusing on when the auctions start, starting price, and duration. Let\u2019s focus on what we can change now.  57:28   David: Priority is not having the first round of flop auctions be re-initialized. Would it make sense to vote on 20% below the current spot price the day before the flop auctions start?   Aaron Bartsch: Won\u2019t someone just dump MKR on the open market?   Cyrus: Relying on a last-minute executive is not best.   David: We know we have backstop syndicate, and other public signals, who would bid at $100 maybe we could use that as a start for the flops?   Cyrus: Nice in theory. I agree that it\u2019s a reasonable starting bid, but I don\u2019t want to cater to the minimum bids based on certain keepers.   David: There is competition, Paradigm, Dharma, Backstop syndicate, and several others. If we start at whatever we know to be the lowest public signal then that might be a good benchmark.   Cyrus: I just hope to have an unbiased way to determine that number.   Charlie: I would second not tailoring around keepers, but picking a market price, $100 is about willingness to purchase at that price point.     1:01:11   Rich: Let\u2019s trust our process and get up a forum post; it comes down to what the risks are. Summarize options. Put up a poll. Then move from there.   LFW: Agreed   Rich: Best timeline for this?   Cyrus: Forum post today, governance poll tomorrow. Any executive may not pass in time, so we should all be cognizant of that.   Rich: Sounds ominous, could we clarify?   Cyrus: If it doesn\u2019t ratify in time then current parameters will stay   Cmooney: If we change the settings, it changes the bidding model strategies too. I wouldn\u2019t allow an executive to change into those active auction plans.   LFW: Good point will add to the summary.   Rich: There is a normal cadence; let\u2019s be aware of the overhead. Governance needs to happen in the Forum. We don\u2019t make decisions on the call. We need to articulate the timing, reasoning, and options. Which is best when written on the Forum, let\u2019s work together to get this post up.     Cyrus USDC and Circuit breaker discussion 1:05:54   Super brief recap. On Thursday, we had two main issues: network congestion and Dai liquidity. We haven\u2019t had a chance to properly address these issues and how they interrelate with each other. Increasing ttl(auction duration) to six hours was primarily to hedge against network infrastructure issues. Eth congestion led to bidding issues etc. Adding the delay allowed keepers to deal with that.   What this didn\u2019t give us was a proper solution to the Dai liquidity issue.    1026\u00d7715 156 KB    Vishesh added more tools to examine how much Dai will get liquidated at different price points (the middle chart in purple).   If ETH hits say $80, then around $6 million Dai will need active keeper bidding. If it hits $70, that\u2019s $11 million. $60 Eth is $26 million. At $55 or lower, it\u2019s $55 million Dai that gets liquidated. These numbers are no joke. This risk wasn\u2019t properly processed by the community in the fast-moving context of the past few days.   ttl doesn\u2019t affect auction keeper liquidity problems. If the price this in that lower bound, I have a gut feeling that keepers won\u2019t get the $50 MM Dai they need for the auctions. This isn\u2019t a function of exchange liquidity, centralized or decentralized. Even if they could handle $50 million worth of ETH, with a 30% buffer, it is possible it\u2019s the Dai liquidity that\u2019s the problem.   The basic premise for the circuit breaker: slow the rate of liquidations should they occur. An example: if $20 mil is on the table a mechanism to liquidate in $5 million chunks, then keepers would be able to recycle the Dai they use in auctions to continue bidding. Let\u2019s say a keeper has $10 million at their disposal, and $30 million is up for bidding. If they could recycle their proceeds to bid on the next batch, that would be doable.   Changing the auction format is a month\u2019s long process. Working on slowing down the collateral liquidating, is where the liquidation freeze mechanism discussion started. If you have a one hour delay based on the oracle, then governance can rally a vote to freeze the liquidations.   Also, we have to deal with unfrozen accounts, and that situation was the impetus for adding USDC as a collateral type. Since many DeFi players have large capital balances in USDC, rather than Dai or Eth. Adding USDC as a collateral type allows USDC based keepers to mint Dai and bid on the auctions. Yesterday Dai also hit $1.10, evident signs of a liquidity crunch (in peg terms). We tracked some of the USDC denominated Dai, and most of it has gone to push the peg back to normal.   IMHO, allowing keepers an opportunity to mint Dai for auctions, is vastly more important than adding USDC for the peg.     Questions and Discussion 1:16:00   David: To summarize, the circuit breaker is relevant because it gives a chance for mass liquidations to parse into lots and no liquidity crunch. The addition of USDC allows for keepers to leverage that asset for temp liquidity participating in auctions. It helps Dai price because it reduces crunch.   Cyrus: Correct. If we triggered vault liquidations at a vault price of say $60 or $50, there would be no set of auction parameters that would allow them to grab enough liquidity to bid on the auctions. We now have two tools: bid auction duration, keeper sourcing Dai liquidity (through USDC as a collateral type). Using it to arb the price down is an additional side effect.   I\u2019m framing this as \u201crisk\u201d because of the broader community sentiment towards USDC. If we only wanted to target auction keeper liquidity but not have USDC be permanent. You could, for example put a 1000% SF on USDC. Since it would make no sense. Except for that one instance where ETH nosedives and an enormous amount of collateral need liquidation.   In such a situation, keepers know that there is a Dai shortage, they could get 50% or higher returns by bidding well. Even in that high fee circumstance, it would make sense to borrow in a 6-hour duration. If we correctly parse the nuances of the liquidation structure, having USDC in the mix, and how to use the circuit breaker.     1:19:52   chat Matthew Light: It might be worth telling everyone on the call that people can immediately generate USDC from USD on Coinbase with no cost. The addition of USDC is essentially equal to adding US dollars as collateral  1:20:19   chat is there any evidence of active keepers with large USDC balances?  (see the following section)    chat Matteo Leibowitz: Are keepers correctly incentivized to alert MKR holders to trigger the circuit breaker? It seems like in most instances, they\u2019d be better off just letting auctions proceed and bidding low.   chat cmooney: we can know if keepers are tapped out too.  If we start seeing liquidations below market that are accumulating to system debt.    Primoz Analysis 1:26:33  1016\u00d7587 131 KB   Last week we had one of the most active weeks this year in migration. Sai supply dropped by $4.5 Million, and the migration contract was $2.5 Million.   Collateralization Ratio1225\u00d7657 149 KB   Since SCD CR was much higher than on MCD, we didn\u2019t see nearly as many liquidations.   CDP repayment activity1013\u00d7576 176 KB   CDP repayment activity: 170 CDPs repaid or got liquidated in the last week, about $4.7 Million in debt repaid.   CDPs migrated918\u00d7564 85.5 KB   The day after Ether crashed, many CDPs migrated.   Data on migration978\u00d7232 61.2 KB    1st hypothesis is: in the last few weeks, CDPs could deposit additional Ether to fight liquidation. Now they capitulated, extra exposure wasn\u2019t worth it. The only way to close the position was to migrate.   2nd hypothesis: SCD is a bit different than MCD; it could have been fear of more significant losses in the system, which would dilute PETH. That would lead to compounding losses.   There is less flexibility in SCD. You can deposit more ETH or migrate, so it seemed that my guess from the past few months (that falling Ether would force their hand) turned out correct. Also, a reminder that penalty fees go to PETH holders. $200K in interest paid to the system as a result of these migrations.    Migrating Sai861\u00d7524 80.7 KB   This is a chart of Sai flowing into the migration contract. Spike on Thursday, likely because there is a premium on Dai, which you can get by migrating. The other option is depositing Dai in secondary markets. There were bite\u2019s today, but no one was bidding. This morning I saw many of them clearing out. There are still a few CDPs with liquidation ratios below 150%, when the peg returns that should alleviate itself.   1273\u00d7624 202 KB   Cyrus showed how much debt liquidates in MCD. In SCD, the situation might be better, but if ETH price goes to $60, most of the debt gets wiped. $80 or even $70 is fine since there is liquidity in the migration contract. If the price drops that low, then we have a Sai liquidity crunch. We mentioned SCD shutdown, however these should be some polling about that.   774\u00d7101 35.4 KB   I checked how much Sai supply is inactive, holders that don\u2019t move have almost $10 million Sai. Hard to say when the incentive to migration will arrive.  Questions 1:35:47   Cyrus: Also, just to point out, the keeper liquidity problem is even worse in SCD than in MCD. In MCD, we have the USDC collateral type and the liquidation freeze. If the price drops, the CDPs go underwater, but keepers can\u2019t come up with the liquidity.  Primoz: We have the buffer in the migration contract.    1:43:21   David: Also wanted to mention this, it\u2019s a little out of order, but cat doesn\u2019t have authority on the USDC flippers, so USDC liquidations aren\u2019t available without another executive vote.  Cyrus: Great point! In the forum post, we mentioned that the collateral type initialized with frozen liquidations. Even SF accruals will not trigger USDC vault liquidations.     786\u00d7670 280 KB   Cyrus: As a brief early analysis of Dai backed by USDC, the primary value of backing by USDC is that it allows keepers to maintain liquidity. You can see here that much of the USDC minting was used for peg arbitrage.  Links from the Chat   Vow contract is here.

Today we\u2019re going to hear from Vishesh; he\u2019s going to give us a state of the pegs. Possibly LongForWisdom, I haven\u2019t given him a heads up, but maybe he\u2019ll do \u201cGovernance at a Glance.\u201d And we\u2019re going to hear from Charles St. Louis, as we dig into MIP 0, the biggest MIP of all. This is going to be an important discussion because we are getting more sophisticated, and the process is being brought to the table. And it\u2019s going to change the way things work if the community ratifies these things. We\u2019re going to be existing in a world that\u2019s different than the one we\u2019re in right now; soon, the time is rapidly approaching. The general idea is that at some point in May, we\u2019re going to flip over into a more MIP-i-fied cadence that requires a re-think or a shift in the way we do things. Charles will give us a refresher on what MIP 0 is all about and how it has implications for the way we govern the ecosystem and how we interact with each other. That\u2019s going to be a big discussion, so I\u2019m not going to use up a lot of time.   What I do want to talk about is me. Let\u2019s talk about me for a second. I have a lot of different hats at MakerDAO, one of those hats that are more relevant to this community or group is being the Interim Governance Facilitator. This role as a facilitator has a fairly sophisticated mandate associated with that role, which is in the forums. I want to focus on the key part of that title, \u201cinterim.\u201d The way we develop things at MakerDAO as a whole is that we need to decentralize. We need to refine and build out this protocol so that we can hand it to the community, and the community can take the reins, and we can all sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor. In order to do that, it\u2019s our opinion that we need to bootstrap parts of the ecosystem. So we created these reference implementations, come up with ideas that are good, provide resources and funding, and frameworks around those groups of actors or tooling. Parts of the ecosystem, basically. Once it\u2019s up and running and has been refined and thought about, and revised, and edited, then the next step is to begin to find people who can assume those responsibilities for us, or with us. I think we\u2019re there(with regards to the Governance Facilitator role,) so this is super exciting for me.   I posted a thread in the forums about me nominating the first truly community-sourced Governance Facilitator. I think that many people who\u2019ve been paying attention to this ecosystem will not see this as a surprise. I think there\u2019s no better person who can step up and assume a leadership role in the governance ecosystem than LongForWisdom. I\u2019ve given him tons of really embarrassing compliments and praise in that forum thread, so I encourage everybody to take a look at it and consider some of my arguments for expanding the role that I currently occupy and formalizing, rewarding, and recognizing the incredible amount of work that Long has been doing over the last, who even knows how long? Feels like years, but it\u2019s probably closer to months.   He\u2019s really stepped up and has done a fantastic job. Personally, I think it\u2019s impossible to find somebody who better represents the needs of the community than LongForWisdom. So please have a look at that forum thread and let the community know what you think. Long, did I sufficiently embarrass you? I can give more praise publicly if you\u2019d like.     Discussions happen in the Forum.   Questions and Comments 1 05:12   LFW: I do not have a speech or a presentation prepared. I\u2019ll respond on that thread in a couple of days. In general, nominating me is very gratifying, so thank you.  Rich: Aww, I think we just had a moment. Thank you, Long. To be serious, though, I could not possibly be happier with the level of work that you\u2019ve put into the ecosystem, the diligence, deep thought, and idealism that comes along with your work. I\u2019ve built out Governance ecosystems in different organizations in my long past, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anyone with as much chops as LongForWisdom, so Maker is fantastically lucky to have a resource like this. I\u2019m extremely happy and looking forward to not being all alone in the Governance Facilitator world and watching this role develop as he puts his own stamp on it, and we eventually increase the number of Governance Facilitators and increase the throughput of this role.    06:44   Cyrus: Is this an additional Governance Facilitator role, or is this a replacement?  Rich: It\u2019s an addition. With an eye for replacement in the near future. With these interim roles and this bootstrapping process, we establish the norm and then move into a hand-off phase. I talk about this in the original mandate that it\u2019s my hope we understand what an Interim Governance Facilitator actually is. The next step is to onboard people from the community to begin assuming those same responsibilities. Then we have a team of Governance Facilitators, and it expands to begin addressing needs we haven\u2019t really spoken about that much but need to be addressed. Having governance facilitators in other parts of the world that have deeper insights into other demographics. Why don\u2019t we have one for the Latin American market? One for the APAC region? The list goes on. There is enough work to go around. My hope is that at some point, we have 2, 3, 4 facilitators. Once that machine is up and running, then the Foundation can take a step back, and the community can own it completely. That\u2019s the goal.    Governance at a Glance LongForWisdom Forum Recap 08:41   Governance at a Glance   The Release of the 13 Initial Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)  Discussion on the MIPs continues. MIP 0 and MIP 3 have attracted a lot of feedback.    Confidence in the Peg   We had a new member of the forum, FullStreets, create a post regarding confidence in the peg, which is something that probably needs to be discussed more. This user is urging more aggressive action to address the peg.   Rich: We see the same conversations arise in the subreddit. One of the interesting things is that there are strong opinions that the peg must be fixed. The solutions seem to be diametrically opposed. Is there a consensus forming in the forum?   LFW: No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much consensus yet. From our perspective, we have basically done most of, or basically all of, the short-term things we can. The other things are onboarding collateral, or super long-term like changes to the protocol, like negative rates, or inject liquidity into the ecosystem. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s consensus, but we should be discussing it because we haven\u2019t seen much change in the last few weeks.     Revisiting GSM Delay & Dark Spell Social Layer Discussion  Will has been investigating updates in the GSM delay and has created a signal request for that. Questioning if we should set it back to 24 hours, or keep it at 4 hours, or something in between.    Seeking Signal   Signal Request: Calibrating GSM delay in light of recent market events  There\u2019s a request to see if we want to set a delay before a shutdown happens so that the ecosystem processes have time to do the things they need to do and be confident on the fixed date, as it\u2019s more difficult to define a date when we\u2019re relying on the executive vote to pass.    Signal Request: Grace period between when SCD shutdown spell is scheduled and actual shutdown   Signal Thread: Do we compensate vault holders that were completely liquidated?  The Governance Poll passed, but we are currently in the middle of better understanding the details before deciding how to move forward with this issue.    Questions and Comments 2 13:00   Rich: (With regards to the topic of compensating vault holders)Do you have a sense that the community has aligned on a path forward? This is an interesting discussion because we\u2019ve been talking about Governance Facilitators. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been in this role and I\u2019ve never really exercised any real power associated with it until the string of polls associated with the compensation strategy deviated significantly from established norms and signaling guidelines, and so I asked the community to form an ad-hoc working group to collect a plan on how they want to address things next week, so we can start dividing up those polls and get this show on the road. Does it feel like there is alignment there? Is there a group of people formed to solve this problem, or are we waiting for more discovery? Is it on MakerMan at this point?   LFW: There might be things I\u2019m not aware of, but my understanding is that Makerman is working on the analysis of the auctions generally and specifically to Black Thursday. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s drastically objected to stopping the second poll, so there\u2019s no widespread outrage or anything.   Rich: The first poll was significant: is the compensation a good idea? Does the community want to do it, yes or no? The answer is yes. That\u2019s a big decision, very cool to watch happen. The second poll was what denomination should that compensation be in? That\u2019s where I felt like we\u2019ve gone from macro to very micro, almost immediately. If we go down that road, there\u2019s going to be a lot of micro polls showing up. I hope that the community can align on a working group to establish stakeholders, figure out what the plan is, come up with the next steps, and then, as an ecosystem, divide what decision-making processes need to go along with that.   Makerman: I pretty much said it in the thread. I ran into a small hitch; I\u2019m not sure if cmooney can talk about this or not, but the hitch slowed it down. My analysis should be complete by the weekend; I\u2019m hoping to post it by Sunday or maybe Monday latest. My issues are in defining what we call Black Thursday and compensation. Do we do it with the first third of the zero-bid auctions and the last end or what? And then running the scenario analysis for compensation: at what level and how the money works. Doing it in Dai is a lot harder to think about and digest than to do it in ETH. I\u2019m going to do it in ETH and then wait for the poll to thrash out.  It\u2019s going to be hard because when you can\u2019t see what the numbers look like in Dai, I don\u2019t know how we can vote on it that way. I have a real issue with defining this in terms of USDC or Dai, where ETH is pretty clean. And then it\u2019s just a matter of determining the time frame. Other than the hitch that I reported to cmooney, which I think has made its way to the Maker Foundation, that something I discovered in these analyses, that\u2019s it. I have my data set, and I\u2019m ready to go through it. I was up all last night taking the data I had, putting it together, and getting it set for the final ruffle through and doing the consistency checks on it to make sure that it looks right.    MakerMan: I have a couple of missing vault numbers that don\u2019t look substantial. But otherwise, this should be pretty clean. I\u2019ll focus on these zero-bids, and I\u2019ll include, as a contrast, Vault 2288. A guy who self-liquidated through, I think, it was DeFiSaver, which gives you kind of a handle as a comparison: if you did this yourself, what would you have gotten. So there\u2019s at least one of those, maybe more. That\u2019s it on my side.     MIP 0 Charles St. Louis 18:15   Before I get started with the presentation, I want to share a couple of links:   Github link to MIP0   Forum Thread to MIP 0   Forum Thread to the initial 13 MIPs      1728\u00d7969 201 KB   For those that don\u2019t know me, my name is Charles St. Louis; I work at the Maker Foundation on the Engineering General Team. I\u2019ve been responsible for the research, architecting, and formalizing of Maker Governance on behalf of the Foundation.   1066\u00d7593 83.9 KB   Before I get started with the presentation, I want to provide a brief overview of what it will entail. So I\u2019m going to give an introduction to the self-sustaining Maker initiative. Not too many details, just a recap. Then I\u2019ll introduce the MIP framework itself, I\u2019ll walk through MIP 0, and lastly, I\u2019ll provide a timeline update on what\u2019s to come in the next couple weeks.   1058\u00d7574 122 KB    So we officially kick-started the self-sustaining Maker initiative approximately 15 days ago, and then Rune went on to the following Governance call and talked about the three pillars of a self-sustaining DAO.   These three pillars (on the slide) are what long-run governance will need and what will eventually make MakerDAO self-sustainable.   EPCs and Domain Teams: Think of them as the decentralized workforce serving the DAO.   MIPs the way to effect change that EPCs, Domain Teams, and community members will use to maintain and improve the protocol and governance.   Vote delegates: You can think of them as politicians serving the broader community needs and helping them make the best decisions possible for the DAO.     With those key pillars in place, we will reach the position of implementing the first Governance Paradigm and be on our way of actually having a self-sustaining DAO.    1060\u00d7567 137 KB   1061\u00d7568 136 KB    MIP0 is structured:   Preamble: This is an administrative thing. It also helps with the management of long-term MIPs. I\u2019ll go through the structure after.   Summary: gives a brief overview of what this MIP is for.   Motivation: why is it needed in general.   Specification: the proposal details. What you\u2019re actually proposing. If it\u2019s a technical MIP, the code. Including the executive code that will be needed to implement it if it does get ratified.      1061\u00d7576 132 KB    So in MIP0's case, there are no dependencies, but for example, in the collateral onboarding MIP set, a lot of the MIPs are relying on each other. So you then indicate which ones work together or are dependant on each other.   There\u2019s a section for replacements. In many cases, some MIPs may become obsolete over time, or they aren\u2019t really in progress or being used, so you can create a new MIP to replace that with updated information, updated processes, and then you\u2019d be indicating which one you\u2019d like to replace.    1014\u00d7572 171 KB   1061\u00d7571 208 KB   1061\u00d7577 172 KB    These are the components of MIP 0. I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail about the first one because you can just read through them, but they do help provide a lot of context for specific words that are used throughout the entire initial 13 MIPs in terms of language and how they all relate.   c2 outlines the Core Principles. There were initially three, but, as part of the Request for Comments phase, LongForWisdom proposed two other ones which I\u2019ll get into.   c3 is the MIP Lifecycle, which is very important. It highlights nine main steps that a MIP needs to go through before it becomes ratified or rejected.   c4 is the Components and the Component Types. They break down the core specification of the MIP itself. They can also be used to add technical types of proposals within them.   c5 is the Replacement Process is how you go about replacing a MIP.   c6 contains the templates.   And c7, c8, c9, c10, c11 are the Domain Role Dependencies will rely upon for support as well as have to elect and remove them.    1063\u00d7577 258 KB    As an example, if you look at the collateral onboarding process, it needs to have all the components that someone can use to get collateral onboarded to a protocol, or else it\u2019s not complete.   Clarity and brevity are the new core principles that LongForWisdom proposed.    1024\u00d7552 129 KB   These are the nine steps that a MIP has to go through before being ratified. In the interest of time, I\u2019ve summarized them. There are a lot more details that you can find in the GitHub page or forum that talk about the criteria these stages and statuses need to meet before they can move to the next one.   1020\u00d7550 256 KB    Request for Comments(RFC) is the stage where we\u2019re at right now. It\u2019s important to know that the ultimate edits are completely dependant on whether the MIP author actually wants to do it. If they don\u2019t accept the community\u2019s feedback is ultimately up to governance to decide if they like it or not.   The feedback period is in many cases 3 months, and then there\u2019s the frozen period.   The Executive Vote is the final stamp for a MIP\u2019s ratification. If the MIP gets voted through, it\u2019s granted the \u201caccepted\u201d status. This is to help maintain them overall and manage them more effectively.    1020\u00d7572 217 KB   The MIPs can have multiple components, as you can see with MIP 0 there are 11. It helps satisfy completeness and readability.   1023\u00d7574 174 KB    The new MIP it\u2019s replacing would have to redirect all the ones that it depends on to make it more clear for people to follow.   I didn\u2019t mention it, but there are few other statuses that MIPs can take. There\u2019s withdrawn status (if the MIP author deems that he doesn\u2019t want to continue at this point), obsolete, or another willing community member can pick it up and finish the work there. That transition process is done with the support of the MIP editor.    1019\u00d7567 129 KB   There are three types of templates. General, technical, and sub-proposals. The General MIP template is what MIP 0 is.   1020\u00d7570 111 KB    The technical MIP template is practically the same thing. Although the specification has a few other key elements that need to be included.   This is the proposed code, which includes the executive code that will need to be used to effect that change.   Test cases.   Security considerations, which are very important. You can be as thorough as you want with the security considerations, but it does help when you can be proactive, assuming what could go wrong with the introduction or implementation of a technical solution, such as including if it\u2019s backward compatible or not.   Auditor Information and their report. With technical solutions, it\u2019s important to have it audited.   Lastly, listing the needed license(s).      1023\u00d7571 154 KB    You can think of it as a mini-process to onboard new things, or remove, in many cases.   The sub proposal component is actually used for this MIP itself for both electing the MIP Editor and the Governance Facilitator and also removing them. As you can see, there are formally named by the MIP number, the component, and then the SP number.    1018\u00d7569 176 KB   I, Charles St. Louis, will propose myself to be a MIP editor next week, and then others will join from the community as we progress through.   1022\u00d7570 135 KB   So I didn\u2019t want to take up too much time with going over how the Domain Roles are elected and removed. They are fairly well laid out within the document itself, but these are the components that detail the removal processes and election processes for these roles. They\u2019re quite similar; the template is pretty much repeated other than the title.   1021\u00d7572 286 KB    Lastly, I want to provide a timeline.   Regarding the Request for Comments phase, I wanted to take a moment and tell you guys that I really appreciate any edits or further feedback; there\u2019s a lot on the forums. I\u2019ve been working with LongForWisdom, especially making the edits. I know a lot of you have strong opinions. So if you have some time, please continue to do that.   If you want to have more details on what the other options are, if the ratification is delayed for one month, you can reference it on MIP 0. I just didn\u2019t have enough space in the slide to detail it.    1021\u00d7571 68.1 KB   That was a lot of information, but I\u2019m done now. If there are any brief questions that anyone has, I\u2019ll be happy to answer them if we have time. Otherwise, please go to the forums or the RocketChat channel (it\u2019s just #MIPs), and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from all of you.  ",

                    "content": "Questions and Discussion 2 38:29   LFW: I have a question about the timeline, rather than content. You mentioned the Smart Contracts team would do a sub-proposal to onboard themselves officially. Do we need to make sub-proposals for the Risk Team as well? They already went through a ratification vote. Would we need to go through the process again just so that it\u2019s recorded as an accepted MIP?   CTL: As of now, it could go either way. The risk team has officially proposed itself as the risk team to the public, as well as the Governance Facilitator, Rich himself, so it\u2019s kind of hand-wavy.   LFW: Yes, as you know, I\u2019m not a fan of hand-wavy things. There\u2019s going to be a sub-proposal for the Smart Contracts teams onboarding, and that\u2019s going to go in the mix repository presumably and exist forever. Do we want the paper trail for the other teams? There\u2019s a list of the ratified teams in one of the MIPs. I forgot which one it is. Do we just add the currently ratified teams to that?   CTL: There are two ways we could do it: we could add the currently ratified ones (the Governance Facilitator and the Risk Team) to the list prior by making a change before April 27th. Or we could submit sub-proposals to actually ratify them through the process themselves. I guess we can base it on community feedback and general consensus.   LongForWisdom: Ok, cool.     40:25   Will Remor: I\u2019m not sure if I got that right from the proposals. There was the notion that was specifically for the Risk Team proposals, and I just wanted to clarify whether I understood it right around the counter-proposals. Because if the Risk Team is submitting a general risk model or a risk model for a particular asset, and then the counter-proposal needs to happen within an X period. I actually haven\u2019t seen a lot of people producing a risk model in 2 weeks. I was not sure whether that was the kind of proposal that was taken into account or the proposal of including some new Risk Team as part of the MIP. It was a little bit uncertain the way that it was raised, so I just wanted to clarify whether risk modeling comes under those timelines as well.   CSL: When I was speaking to the competition proposals, if the timing says that we want to delay the ratification votes of the MIPs, community members can propose anything that\u2019s directly competing with one of the 13 MIPs and provide it as an alternative for the community to choose.   CSL: The general risk model sub-proposal, you can make a competing proposal, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be during this time. After the MIPs framework is in place, there are general risk models that can be proposed, and it\u2019s up to the community to decide whether they want to use it or not. Cyrus might be able to cover some answers there.   Cyrus: I think the idea is MIP 11 allows a template for any new risk team to essentially apply to be a risk team and submit whatever methodology they have for evaluating assets. Then, pending approval from the community of such a risk model, they could then propose asset evaluation risk parameters for any asset they want, of course, in conjunction with what the community wants. If there are competing assets or competing risk teams for the same asset, that shouldn\u2019t really be a problem. The community would essentially select one or the other.   WR: Yeah, I think the easiest way to frame what I was thinking was to imagine a competition where different risk teams are submitting competitive models for the same asset or the same purpose. So you have two playing around, and the one with the best parameters or the best accuracy leads the part.   C: I think that\u2019s generally the idea. Competing risk teams and essentially MKR holders will ultimately decide which methodology they want to go with. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy beforehand to declare which one is better.   W: Yeah, it was not about declaring beforehand, it was about the timeline, but I think that Charles has clarified that, so that sounds good.     44:48   chat Maker Man:  wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to take the mic.  But put as simply as I can community will have to decide whether what is put forward is sufficient. It is my opinion all of these will need revisiting, given time constraints. A question to everyone is whether something is better than nothing at this point unless a competing MIP proposal can be put together.  Right now, I don\u2019t see external community resources going after alternative MIP sets.   Maker Man: As follow up to my chat comment, my reaction to the MIPs is, given the time frame, what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to decide whether to go with what we have. And that\u2019s going to be for everyone to decide in terms of just MKR voting. Right now, I don\u2019t see external community resources going after an alternative MIP set, I know LongForWisdom and I have discussed it, we both don\u2019t have the time to go after right now, we have other priorities. Someone else in the community can step up on doing an alternative MIP set; we\u2019d like to hear from you guys and talk to you. But I don\u2019t see it happening, so we\u2019re going to be looking at what we have and whether we want to vote it in as a placeholder. We\u2019ll have to revisit all of this, I think. I\u2019m going to leave it at that.   Rich: Charles, can you maybe speak to how malleable or iterative the MIPs sets are, and what happens if the community comes up with input in the next month or something after ratification?   Charles St Louis: In general, if you don\u2019t feel like you have the time to create alternative MIPs, or competing MIPs rather, all the more emphasis on putting a lot of effort into this Request for Comments phase and trying to make the current MIPs as adopted as possible. The MIPs framework, in general, is built upon iterative improvements, and as I mentioned, there\u2019s an entire component in MIP 0 dedicated to replacements of MIPs. There\u2019s no timeline for replacing a MIP in the future.   Maker Man: I was going to say, that\u2019s the whole point. If we look at what we have now and decide, we can always redo it later. It\u2019s not that critical, and when I look at the scheme of what\u2019s going on. I mean, it\u2019s important, yes. But what we get in place when and how, what it means, it\u2019s going to be how we use it, really. We all know we\u2019re going to be going through these things when we finally start doing them and going: \u201cOh, we got to change this\u201d or \u201cWe should add this.\u201d   One thing I was going to suggest: I don\u2019t like the sub-proposal idea, and I don\u2019t think it works. My case here is that if it\u2019s in the proposal, it should be a component. If it isn\u2019t, it should be its own MIP, if it can be separate. If it doesn\u2019t have to be and accounts for the whole thing you\u2019re trying to describe, just stick it in there. The idea of templates for what Domain teams have to execute MIPs, those are in templates, we just vote on them. We change the list like a vote revision; when you think about it from that context, the details of who and what you put in things, think about it in the sense of lists and templates of what they do, and who does it.   \u201cWho\u2019s doing what with what MIPs,\u201d those are lists of things. You have stuff in the templates of literal lists of things, that\u2019s just a list for who gets to do MIP 0 or who\u2019s dealing with governance, MIP 1 or what they\u2019re doing. Generally, in terms of names and domains, EPCs, all the contracts that we\u2019re going to be dealing with, Oracle suppliers, and who we give Oracle information to, etc. All this kind of stuff is off to the side in template information in some of these MIPs. How do we change governance parameters? That\u2019s going to be a kind of template. E.g., what numbers we change. For doing financial governance and risk governance. They don\u2019t have to be their own MIP. They can be a template of data within a MIP that we execute as a sequence. And not specifically laid out in a MIP, just its own little list.   CSL: So basically there would be less MIPs and more components with sub-proposals, is that what you\u2019re saying?   Maker Man: That was my point on the sub-proposals. They\u2019re not sub-proposals, they\u2019re data elements to the MIP. One\u2019s that Governance then later decides what to add to, and who to remove, and whatever conditions they want to put on them generally, which ideally would go in the MIP itself. It reduced the number of MIPs, and it puts just the details of how these people access and operate what and how.   CSL: That\u2019s great feedback. If you could write it down and have it posted somewhere where we can iterate on, that would be really helpful.   MM: Well, that was the forum comment. Let\u2019s revisit this another time.   Cyrus: let\u2019s post the link to the forum for the MIPs, as I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s been posted yet. And there\u2019s also a Rocket.Chat channel for discussion.   MM: If there\u2019s anybody out there working on an alternative MIP set, I just want to know. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s happening. So Governance is going to sit here and go \u201cwell, do we take it or no?\u201d. Just look at it from a governance perspective, right? We\u2019re going to have to vote on this in the time frame presented, and it will be done as is. The amount of work that can be actually done to change it is kind of limited. The people here who would work on this are kind of under different guns now realistically. Unless somebody else steps up, please, do!   LFW: I would be interested to hear if any of the community members even if they\u2019re not willing or have the time to work on an alternative MIP set themselves, I\u2019m interested to know if anybody actively wants there to be an alternative. Does anyone think that we need an alternative? Does everyone think the current versions are fine?   Rich: That\u2019s an interesting question. Maybe we can make an informal poll. I\u2019m also interested in knowing how much the community has a mental model of what the MIPs process is all about. I think there\u2019s a lot of cognitive overhead here, and I\u2019m unsure of how well this process has been absorbed by the general ecosystem. We might be getting slightly ahead of ourselves to find out whether people have already begun creating mental models of alternative MIP processes and how many people are trying to wrap their heads around what the actual MIP process is.     53:46   WR: Working by example, do we have quite a significant number of MIPs that have been submitted that actually fit into the model, or are they mostly just at template level at this point?   CSL: Can you repeat that? I wanted to make a slight correction when I was talking about the domain teams that have been ratified before: the risk team actually never officially proposed themselves as a risk team. That was only Rich for the Governance Facilitator. The risk teams are only judged based on the general models. I just wanted to make that correction. Sorry for that mistake.   Cyrus: I think that goes in line with Will\u2019s earlier question about how new risk teams are essentially evaluated based on the content they\u2019re producing. I think the current structure for the MIPs, regarding the risk teams, is essential that they would be proposing a general model for review by the community. That\u2019s what gets voted-in as opposed to a specific risk team based on the individuals. The idea being that any discussions or issues with the risk parameters or methodologies can stem directly from the model itself and not the people behind it. If I\u2019m not mistaken, there isn\u2019t necessarily, at least for MIP 11, it would just be the general model that\u2019s proposed, and I guess the risk team would be part of the domain team aspect? Sorry.   LFW: I\u2019m pretty sure that the general risk models need to be submitted by the domain risk team.   CY: Yeah, I think I confused myself there actually.   WR: So then there is a workflow of one then the other, kind of thing. Am I getting it right? First, you sign yourself in as a risk team, and then you submit a model, or you can actually submit a model not being part of the risk team?  CSL: The first one.      56:58   LFW: What did you say about the risk team not being ratified? Did we never ratify the interim risk team?  CY: Yes, that was a correction; the current risk team was never officially ratified as a risk team of any sort in the same way that Rich was.    57:17   MM: I was just posting on the side chat that I think it\u2019s interesting, with respect to the MIPs here, we have a one-bidder auction for MIP set. When I see the one-bid auctions in the liquidations, I cringe because those are the worst ones all the way to the zero levels. We got the same kind of thing going on here at Maker. I\u2019d love to see multiple bidders for the positions and functions, talking about risk, Governance, legal, it\u2019s an interesting idea. How many bidders do we have for our functions?  Rich: Yes, I agree. That\u2019s why I wanted to get this general temperature of the room about the visibility on the process, and how well it\u2019s been absorbed. It feels like we have people, like engaged stakeholders, that have deep insights into MIPs, some have vague insights, and others that have no insights. Trying to get everyone up to speed at the same time is a little bit of a challenge. I guess the question is for Charles: how do we accelerate? It\u2019s an open question. I\u2019m hesitant to lead a conversation because particularly when we haven\u2019t addressed all the comments on the side chat.    59:00   Mitote: The biggest thing we need to keep in mind is what are the goals, what are we trying to achieve, what we are trying to do, and how do we want to do it. Realizing that the MIP process is mainly a perspective on how to organize ourselves socially in order to agree on things and move things to MKR holders. I guess in terms of alternatives, if people have alternative MIP sets, then that\u2019s awesome, and let\u2019s see them. But aside that, continuing the way we have been building up the signaling process, the collateral onboarding, there are all sorts of other questions like compensation, domain teams, and all that. There are other ways to think about how we organize ourselves socially.   CSL: The main goal of this framework is to enable the community to drive the organization of governance and effectively help maintain and improve the protocol over time. In 10 years, there might be a whole different framework, a whole different type of process. The whole point is that we\u2019re really trying to kick-start this next step of having everything be community-driven and built from the roots up.   Mitote: What I\u2019m trying to say is, to some degree, it already is. People are already organizing, and people are already influencing things. I think one of the bigger questions is: how should domain teams interface with Governance? Those people have deep knowledge and skills on certain things, so we should be leveraging that a little bit more. MakerMan is making a good point in the side chat: that at the end of the day, MKR holders are the ones deciding. All of this needs to be understood in that context. This process isn\u2019t going to change that fundamental fact.   CSL: Do you have any ideas for how you would propose the domain teams working with governance or any alternative framework? I would be interested in that.   Mitote: Yes. I think I\u2019ve sent some stuff in the past in the working group before. I\u2019ve been toying with other ideas where each different domain having main heads, kind of like how it is now, Rich with Governance, Cyrus with Risk, Mariano with Smart Contracts. Having MKR holders allot budgets to them, maybe they bring a couple of other people on the leads too, and those leads distributing and contracting other people in their networks that they know they\u2019re doing good work for Smart Contracts or Risk. How would MKR holders know who\u2019s good at it? I\u2019d much rather trust Cyrus to hire or contract someone to do some work, rather than guessing or trying to figure it out myself.   CY: That\u2019s a great point. The evaluation process or the hiring of new Risk teams is going to require its own fairly significant initiative. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as simple as \u201cOh, here\u2019s a MIP,\u201d and it just says \u201cvote X, Y, Z as an Oracle team,\u201d and then that\u2019s the end of it. I would view these MIPs as an explanation of things that need to get done, but the actual process behind that will be significantly more involved, I think, in a good way.   M: At the end of the day, it is just people talking to each other and trying to figure out how to do it. Also, how we pay people. I have no idea how the Foundation pays Vishesh or whoever, but I\u2019m guessing that might be different from how Smart Contracts people work, or how Rich works at the community development department. It might be hard for MKR holders to figure it out.   R: Yes, it\u2019s fantastically complicated, and we\u2019re running out of time, so I\u2019m going to try to put a bow on this thing if I can. But to speak to that one specific issue, this is something that we have talked about on calls back to the beginning of time. We have the Foundation, and we have the community. As we become more sophisticated, the community self-organizes. So the community we have now is nothing like we had one year ago, or two years ago. We have PR teams, risk teams, and we have collateral onboarding teams, and people are self-organizing, which is ideal. That\u2019s exactly what we need to decentralize. But this is a long process. Once groups of actors self-identify or get identified by the ecosystem, and then we look to fill those roles. The Foundation has to bootstrap those things because there\u2019s no funding mechanism sitting around right now that we can use to allocate to the ecosystem. It\u2019s built into the protocol, and it\u2019s part of the plan, to have the buffer and MKR stability fees inevitably be funding these things. One of the major evolutions, or growth spurts, that the community has to go through is how does it handle an allocation of its own budget to fund the actors that it\u2019s identified? That\u2019s when EPC and domain teams come into play. There are working groups that started recently to clarify what the implications of that are, how they can work, and all the rest of it. There will be communication and presentations and all kind of things coming about how that happens. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s a major paradigm shift, that\u2019s when true autonomy happens. When, ultimately, the ecosystem needs to be able to identify its own requirements and allocate some resources that satisfy those requirements. It\u2019s going to be enormously important, but there\u2019s no clear picture of exactly what that looks like right now, other than the fact that the protocol needs to be able to pay for the protocol operations, so we\u2019ll see what that looks like soon. I feel that I might be preemptively ending this debate, which I think is super helpful and healthy, so we have to continue it.   Rich: Here\u2019s a summary: we have MIPs process, we have MIP 0, which is sophisticated, and that is going to launch us into MIP 3. And MIP 3 is what the government life cycle is all about. And there\u2019s an aggressive timeline associated with this. On May 4th, we begin a new governance cycle that\u2019s outlined in MIP 3, so the community needs to have an understanding of what that implies and what the responsibilities are and how that will change things, assuming that the MIPs are ratified. I encourage people to engage with this process, so have a look at the forum thread posted here. Express your feelings and your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.     Analysis Vishesh The State of the Pegs 1:09:24  1008\u00d7494 120 KB   The long story short is that there has not been a significant change in what\u2019s going on with the Dai supply overall. So, those values are sitting at a pretty steady-state, now that Dai from USDC is down to under a million. Obviously, that part makes sense, given the reduced need for that at the moment and the higher cost.   1014\u00d7495 81.4 KB   In terms of the collateral portfolio, ETH has been sitting pretty constant from where it was last week. The collateralization ratios have not changed that much.   1008\u00d7302 38.5 KB   1016\u00d7492 103 KB   As you can see that the liquidation prices are primarily between $103 and $80, so that\u2019s still pretty constant.   1016\u00d7495 73.6 KB    For DAI trades, what we saw in the last 24 hours was a decent volume on Uniswap. This is a small, atypical data point; usually, it\u2019s not such a large percentage for Uniswap. We saw a fair amount of slippage there.   The Volume Weight Average Price (VWAP) of Dai is still sitting above peg at ~$1.02.   Over the last 24 hours, the Sai trades, though relatively few, were trading down below peg. This is interesting because Sai and Dai usually follow each other pretty well. Perhaps that\u2019s an indication that things are a little shaky on the Sai peg.     In terms of USDC, a large chunk of the CR is closer to the 120% requirement, since there\u2019s low perceived volatility.    Though some of those positions do maintain more collateral than they need.     In the last week, Dai trades are very similar. Mostly hovering at a $1.02 with a bit more trading on the last day. All still steadily above the peg.  Relevant Links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Questions and Discussion 3 1:12:59   LFW: I noticed Dai locked in the DSR is decreasing, which is, I think, good. It\u2019s not quick, but still coming down. Do you have any thoughts?   V: It was sort of weird that Dai in DSR wasn\u2019t coming down faster earlier, given that the rates were adjusted. That makes total sense; the weird part is that it took so long.   Rich: We\u2019ve seen this behavior before though, these apps are fantastically sticky for some reason. There is maybe some sort of threshold I\u2019m unclear on what it is, where people start breaking out hardware wallets and start moving things to other areas. Maybe it\u2019s a lack of better alternatives if the DSR is 0.   V: Presumably, the people who do use it in that way see is relatively risk-free or a free parking spot on a monopoly board. In that context, to them, the yield that\u2019s available for supplying it in other platforms maybe doesn\u2019t justify their perceived potential risks in using those platforms. They view it as, \u201cok, I\u2019m eating the capital costs.\u201d But from their perspective, it\u2019s a risk-free option.   V: The gist is, not much has changed this past week, it\u2019s been relatively quiet.     End of Call Rich Summary and Open-ended Discussion 1:14:57   Rich: I\u2019m going to summarize some stuff:   We had a long presentation from Charles, please join the forums for the discussion and engage with the MIPS discussion. There are many weighty decisions that we\u2019ll have to make in the coming weeks. There are many things that we did not address in this call that are happening, so many things that I\u2019m probably not going to remember all of them. Here\u2019s a list:   GSM. Needs to be understood and reviewed.   Mechanisms for dark fixes. Who do we trust? How do we trust them? There is a social layer there that needs to be understood when it comes to fixing problems in the protocol.   SCD shutdown: there\u2019s a topic worthy of conversation. It\u2019s fairly monumental. The community has signaled that they want to do it on the 24th. There are issues that need to be discussed here, though. And this is a topic that I\u2019m going to be revisiting more and more in the coming weeks, the difference between intent and feasibility.     Rich: We have an open-source governance ecosystem, where people can come in, make a proposal, the MKR holders can signal agreement or disagreement. But, that doesn\u2019t make the world turn backward. If the community wants to do a thing, they can say they want that thing to happen. But there is this missing piece of the puzzle where feasibility comes into play. Is it possible to do that thing?   How long will it take to do that thing?   Who needs to do that thing?   What order those things need to happen.   This is, probably, a highly technical group, so we all been through this process in our own specific domains. Coming up with a good idea is one thing, getting a project plan, road map, and implementation (and all the rest of those wonderful things) in order is quite another.   To loop this back to what I was talking about. The community has signaled that they want to shut down by the 24th, but we all have to understand what does that actually mean. How does that work? How are we going to tell people about it? Does the rest of the ecosystem know it\u2019s coming? There are lots of conversations that need to happen. If you have an interest in SCD and its imminent demise, please join the forums as well.     01:17:36   Cyrus: On Tuesday and Wednesday, the risk team held additional governance calls. We encourage everyone to check out the recordings where we discussed some collateral risk modeling type stuff.   Recording 1: Collateral Risk Model Overview Presentation with Cyrus Younessi   Recording 2: Collateral Risk Model Inputs Overview Presentation with Cyrus Younessi   Questions from Will about if we\u2019re going to continue these risk calls like last week. As of right now, I think we will. I think we\u2019ll try to do some additional ones outside the regular Thursday circuit, but we haven\u2019t quite locked down the details about times and dates about that.   Will: Yeah, awesome. The calls from last week are the ones that I\u2019m more interested in being at. I missed the notification, so it\u2019s all good. Looking forward to the risk and data-focused calls in the future.     Rich: Thanks Cyrus, for that clarity.  We can look forward to that. A lot to absorb, so I\u2019ll summarize: join the forums. That\u2019s where governance is happening, that\u2019s where your voice can be heard, where the community creates consensus. The social layer that the MKR holders, by and large, follow. If you want to fix the protocol, make it better, improve it, alter it, that\u2019s the place to go. Thanks, everyone, great call. Talk to you next week.

We are going to talk mostly about Risk in this call. Last week we had a great call discussing much of our governance-related issues. Both governance and risk management are complex worlds that will require more depth of attention.   We\u2019ve set up communication channels like this call, the forums, and Rocketchat. Numerous community members like Sam and LongForWisdom have stepped up to work within the framework of these channels to build out processes, guidelines, and signaling methodologies. The community has also worked within these channels to determine how we manage the levers/policy tools available to us. A perfect example of that is Sam\u2019s efforts to create a DSR spread vote. There\u2019s a fantastic amount of activity happening in the forum lately. This governance call will eventually be more targeted towards addressing the various issues and proposals that show up in the forums.   There\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us, getting these ideas into initiatives/plans/proposals and then to on-chain votes. We need to figure out how to alternate between risk-centric issues and governance-centric issues. Our goal is making sure our governance becomes efficient.     Give us feedback about the call.   DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN IN THE FORUM   LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 3:14   Governance at a Glance Thread   Source Cred Algorithm and how it could apply to MakerDAO  Seth Benton from SourceCred presents a description of the SourceCred algorithm and how it could apply to MakerDAO.    Maker Governance Overhead  PlanetX details some of the overheads to Maker Governance and paints a rather grim (though not inaccurate) picture of the future.    How does Governance Voting Actually Work  Adam asks some questions as to how executive votes work in practice. This once again makes it clear that the system is rather opaque to newcomers.    How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes?   Moving On-Chain LongForWisdom combines the previous signal requests about bundling into a single request that asks for how specifically we should deal with bundled executives.    OLD Signal Request: Should we replace the weekly DSR governance poll with a DSR Spread governance poll?   Passed On-chain Hexonaut elaborates on his change to how the governance poll handles adjusting the DSR, putting the options forward to the community for signaling.   Congrats to Sam on passing the DSR spread poll.     Seeking Signal   Should Maker make a Treasury to manage revenue?  In addition to the discussion thread above, Mitote creates a signal thread to gather opinions.    SCD Shutdown  Aaron presents a summary of his recent signaling polls regarding SCD shutdown. Lots of interesting thoughts here, hopefully moving on-chain soon.    Questions and Discussion 5:42   Rich: How can one game the incentives of the SourceCred model?   LongForWisdom: Since it creates something like a reputation system by ranking users based on their quantitative participation, you could use those rankings as an input to help determine a person\u2019s compensation.   R: I have this compensation mental-model, but maybe the reputation is the reward itself. This subject is complicated. We want engagement, but engagement based on people with high reputation scores becomes like a weighting system (Rich is wrapping his head around the idea of SourceCred\u2019s model.)   Charles St.Louis: I\u2019ve done a bit of research on SourceCred. It\u2019s a toolbox for reputation through a weighted peer review system for communities or distributed teams.   It\u2019s a modified version of \u2018page rank;\u2019 that algorithm is on a contribution graph to produce cred-attribution.   Sourcecred members earn reputation defined by the community or its\u2019 leaders, and they get compensated for the value they bring to the system in that way. The biggest open question is measuring contributions by quantity versus quality.     R: This reminds me of the conversation around incentivized voting. Are the incentives aligned around securing the system and stabilizing the peg, or are they here to make someone $.50? We have this conversation often, \u201cis participation our primary goal?\u201d If 1000 people are voting every week, is that voter volume one data point in a long path towards healthy governance?   The reputation idea makes me nervous and is fraught with peril. Much like crypto, which can be used for self-agency but can also follow a dark path where it\u2019s the greatest dystopian record-keeping system invented by man.   When you combine a blockchain with reputation, I get slightly nervous about the barrier to entry for newcomers. E.G., brilliant newcomers feel: \u201cI want to come to fix problems for MakerDAO, but I don\u2019t have a badge or enough points.\u201d     David: Agree that the quality of contributions is an important consideration. Sourcecred is one piece of the puzzle since it only approaches it from a quantitative perspective. It could be useful to help establish some reputation for community members since we could see the person\u2019s forum activity profile and other contributions profile over time. If someone has been regularly contributing for a year or something, that could be a data point used in helping to determine compensation.   R: Exactly, adding it as just another data point. It\u2019s not the criteria for whether someone can or can\u2019t vote or something like that.     10:02  David: One thing I like about recent forum behavior is that the owners of Signal request threads create new threads that summarize the discussion and views to-date. For example, Derek\u2019s thread where he summarized the SCD GS conversation. That thread summarized all the relevant points from the previous posts and combined his own positional knowledge to help move the issue forward. This behavior makes it easier for people to jump into issues mid-way through.  10:59   Rich: (goes back to the discussion on reputational systems in MakerDAO) There are things I\u2019m concerned about to though. On the other hand, many people don\u2019t care about reputation/online-web-points/etc., and they won\u2019t wait for this to work. It\u2019s exciting, but another thing to consider is pre-filtering and incentivization within reputation. Do we want to incentivize people that are driven by the gamification of status? Is that a quality that good Governance requires. We don\u2019t have an identity on the blockchain until then; we have status as a stopgap solution.   T: ETHtrader on Reddit has Donut(s). Merely a good case study to think about making reputation fun, they eventually put a token on Ethereum and made it tradeable on Uniswap.   C: I apologize for creating that meme. I had nothing to do with the tokenization.   R: Donuts are also an excellent example of how a reward system based on contributions can be fun until it ruins you.     14:16   Memelord chat: \u201cGasless voting?\u201d:   Rich: Gasless voting ties into both incentives and reducing friction. We have developers here who can talk about that friction. If I recall, leveraging relayers was a possible solution to subsidize gas costs, but not sure where we are with that conversation. Is that a significant friction, though?   LFW: You can vote with 1 GWEI which is less than a penny. It\u2019s very inexpensive to vote.     SamM: For me, the friction is not so much the cost, but rather the waiting. I mentioned the load time for governance poll voter breakdowns and the need to load multiple pages and synchronously wait for them to load. Waiting to vote, waiting on the blockchain, etc. Any way to make that quicker?   Rich: That\u2019s likely a UX pain to evaluate. I suffer through this often. I heard from Chris Bradbury that there are initiatives afoot to set up a caching layer, but I\u2019m unsure of the progress.   Derek: We\u2019ve got it on the backlog. We need to see what else we need to prioritize in that space. There are a few UI/UX components, but that may include a redesign of the Governance app. There are several ideas we need to pull together into a roadmap. Happy to share with everyone when it\u2019s fleshed out.     20:54   Rich: If the DSR-spread GP idea works, what are its implications? The idea was that now we potentially don\u2019t have to poll for it every week. How often should we vote on the spread? Sam, you have some thoughts on that?   Sam: I think it should run weekly for now. I figured there would be a large consensus (99%) that people would want the DSR to follow the SF. If that sentiment keeps up, then we can reduce the frequency.   Cyrus: Add 0% to the poll next week?   R: My mistake, I didn\u2019t add that, but yes, next week! Thanks for the reminder.     Risk Cyrus Analysis 1 26:10  Sai stability fee when up to 9% last week. This week, the MCD ETH stability fee is being voted up to 8%. DSR will be 7.75% if Friday\u2019s EV passes.  Primoz Kordez Analysis 2 28:02  890\u00d7674 134 KB    Saw a high migration flow last week. We also crossed the 100 million Dai mark. About 8 million Sai migrated. Dai supply increased for about 12 million, which means an additional 4 million Dai was minted in a week.   Also saw Sai in the migration contract start to accumulate, at one point there was about 6 million Sai deposited, after which the 2nd largest SCD CDP used this Sai to migrate.  From last week\u2019s call, this was the one CDP doing the most minting. I originally thought that this would be the last CDP to migrate, but this theory was destroyed. This CDP has changed its mind, likely either due to worries about tax implementation or limitations of Sai liquidity.    This week I prepared some stats that are not directly related to migration, though I think they are useful for MakerDAO governance.   Document can be found here.   This was prepared for Spencer Noon\u2019s newsletter, which I regularly contribute to.      659\u00d7723 147 KB   636\u00d7566 139 KB   612\u00d7658 135 KB   Not much has changed since last week\u2019s analysis.   619\u00d7552 114 KB   642\u00d7580 91 KB    631\u00d7513 136 KB   620\u00d7688 171 KB  Vishesh 42:17 Relevant links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Insights  1514\u00d7567 107 KB    24hr trading activity:   Dai 24 hour volume-weighted average traded very slightly below peg for a short time. Despite discussions regarding increasing SF\u2019s on Rocketchat and Twitter, we should understand that these are very small deviations. It\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s deviated enough to warrant any action.   Middling amount of trading volume in the last 24 hours, around 2 million.      779\u00d7554 126 KB   762\u00d7534 152 KB    There will always be moments when there is a short run-up or run-down of price. Taking a slightly longer time-scale view can help to make better conclusions for monetary policy.   These short dips are oftentimes driven by trading activity more than stability fees. This is not a new discussion regarding the role of monetary policy levers and their impact on the price vs. the price having its own externally driven, market-based fluctuations.   Will revisit this thread in a more statistically-driven context, both on this call and on the forums.      1510\u00d7568 74.1 KB   Sai trading volume is very low, around 240k. Shockingly, the volume-weighted average price is pretty close to peg despite the drying up of liquidity.   Uniswap Dai Liquidity1026\u00d7178 51.9 KB    Dai Liquidity is really only about $2.8 million. Compared to the total Dai supply out there, and compared to what you may see for some other assets, this is pretty low.   Uniswap trading volume is on the low end compared to some of the other places where Dai trades.   Additionally, dYdX has picked up in the share of Dai trading volume since MCD launched.      Uniswap Sai Liquidity1032\u00d7182 49.9 KB   Interesting point, Dai and Sai are closer in trading activity in terms of liquidity on Uniswap than globally.   Uniswap MKR Liquidity1029\u00d7169 49 KB    MKR trading activity and liquidity is an important topic and will become more relevant when we start discussing risks in the event of auctions and the various appetites for printing MKR and selling it off, and what price impacts be vs. MKR burn, projected revenues, and stuff like that.  Interesting topic area to keep in mind for the future.     7day trading on Dai1522\u00d7504 139 KB   On a longer time scale, Dai trading activity has been pretty solid at 25 million.   1502\u00d7618 149 KB    The top graph is the amount of ETH locked as collateral in MCD vaults.   The bottom graph is the amount of ETH Dai issued from MCD.   Green spikes are increases; red spikes are decreases.   This is a corollary to the old SCD system of Draws and Wipes.     They both correlate closely but can be interesting to view together to track spikes and drops in collateral movements. This is helpful to understand how the amount of collateral and debt fluctuate over time.    755\u00d7558 115 KB    Net Dai+Sai supply has been consistently increasing. Dai supply has been steadily increasing while Sai has been steadily decreasing.   Dai has been increasing faster than Sai has been decreasing.   Translates into an increase in usage or demand of Dai.   Dai in DSR contracts should be taken into consideration as well.        Compound market stats1035\u00d7544 94.8 KB    On Compound, there has been a consistent drain in the amount of gross borrow of Sai. This has resulted in borrow APR first going down and then coming up a bit.   It has become theoretically less and less profitable to borrow and lend with Sai.   This should incentivize trading with Dai.   Migration seems to be proceeding in the right direction based on the numbers.       Questions to Vishesh 52:34   Michael Newman: [Do you have insights on] Implications of Compound removing Sai from the interface if you are not actively borrowing it?  V: As we have seen many times with crypto, UI plays a huge role in the market activity of an asset.    Discussion and Questions 52:34   Cyrus: Thanks, Vishesh! Anyone have thoughts on Sai liquidity as it relates to ES? Since, as per Primoz and Vishesh, Sai liquidity has been dropping. Is there a point where it becomes impossible to migrate?   Primoz: It\u2019s always going to be possible; it\u2019s just a matter of price. Market makers might mint Sai and sell at a premium. If Sai SF is going to be 9%, perhaps they will charge an extra percent to help that migration to Dai.   C: What\u2019s a reasonable price then? SF going up limits the options in terms of liquidity.   Vishesh: A better question is: \u201cwhat\u2019s your goal?\u201d If the goal is protecting users from a price impact on migration, then I don\u2019t think forcing shutdown helps. Eliminating the overhead and management of the system is the only goal I can think of, In terms of forcing a shutdown. The asset is, more or less, leveling out to some bottom.   C: There was always an implicit context that Governance would protect users from those large price impacts. E.G., if the price jumps to $1.05, then an emergency GS might be called. In that context, Governance would do what they could to prevent that, but if you change perspective to minimizing overhead, then what happens if the peg does deviate?   P: I think we need to focus on when ETH is crashing, that\u2019s when CDPs want to de-leverage, and people want to buy Sai. Now with Sai liquidity mostly drained, the spike will be higher, and we might see Sai above $1.   C: In November, we saw $1.03 or $1.04. It could easily be much higher now.   LFW: We should have a signal poll for a liquidity-based shutdown. Rather than based on peg deviation since ideally, we would shut down before the peg deviates.   V: That\u2019s kind of my point. Since we\u2019re so low in liquidity now, we\u2019re setting people up for a price motivated danger.   L: So, you\u2019re saying that if we should shut down on low liquidity, now would be the time?   V: I don\u2019t think an additional 10% drop in liquidity is likely in the next few weeks. Nor will it make a big impact on price in the event of an ETH run-up or crash.     59:35   SamM: Another thing about Shutdown scenarios, are we assuming we\u2019ll implement tax? Are we planning to forgive the Stability Fees in an ES situation?   C: So there are three decisions to make:   What is the decision mechanism for the community to implement ES?   What is the lag time from when the decision is made to the hard date?   What is the technical implementation?     Presumably, the technical implementation should be figured out perfectly before we roll out the shutdown. But Sam, yes, the tax is part of what needs to be figured out.   L: Aaron has been going through the shutdown threads, and he noted that he\u2019d keep the threads going in the forum.   C: Do we have an update on anything regarding tax?   D: I like Nik\u2019s perspective that it\u2019s a communications issue, not a technical one.   C: I think a written proposal would be most helpful. Something clear for the community.     1:02:14   N: Derek\u2019s forum post expands on my rocketchat mini-post. I\u2019ll put something together for next week.   What\u2019s happening technically: there is a new fee parameter called tax that you can levy on CDPs. It works like the SF, but the SF doesn\u2019t accrue on the debt of a CDP, while tax does. We\u2019re in this situation where CDPs can be open indefinitely without being liquidated because the SF doesn\u2019t get added to their debt.   The other situation is that in GS, we use debt as a basis for calculating the settlements. That\u2019s why SF\u2019s are forgiven since they aren\u2019t reflected in a CDPs debt. Once you turn on tax, it\u2019s suboptimal to pay back your CDP since you have accrued fees and tax. Game theoretically, the only two times a CDP owner would want to pay their fees is either:   before the implementation of tax or   during GS when you pay the tax instead of SF\u2019s.     All of that is to say; it\u2019s not a technical issue; it\u2019s a communications issue. E.g., \u201cthis is tax, and when it will happen\u2026\u201d Making that statement loud enough will force users into a decision. Since they will recognize the game theory of their current position and, as a result, pay their fees one way or another.     1:04:59   R: Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a large holder, with $50K in fees, and ES is looming. Is tax designed to reach parity with what my fees would have been? What happens if someone has 10k in fees or less? Are they taxed proportionally? Or is this parameter like a big stick, do I imagine that correctly?   N: It is a VERY big stick. If you make sure that the tax is equivalent to SF\u2019s, then it lacks the incentive to pay SF\u2019s, which would then lack the supply crunch to close positions, where pricing would be over a $1 to close positions.   To make tax effective, you have to hammer it down, making it more expensive than SFs.   Besides, the period tax is running after implementation is short. The tax_period doesn\u2019t have to be a month; it can be a few days. We could discuss that timing more.   You mentioned fairness, which gets tricky. CDPs were opened at different points in time. When you apply tax that won\u2019t be taken into account. My thought is the tax parameter should be set by profiling all the largest CDP\u2019s. How long they\u2019ve been open, how many unpaid fees they\u2019ve accrued, then set tax based on a profile that most of them fit.       1:08:25   C: One quick technical clarification: if two CDPs are open both with $10k Dai debt, but a year apart, they would be charged the same tax even if the age of debt is different?   N: Correct. That\u2019s why I keep mentioning communication problems. The community needs to decide, \u201cGS on this date.\u201d and when GS comes in, you implement tax as phase 0 of GS. The communication has to be loud and clear: \u201cthis is the day that it\u2019s in your best interest to pay back fees.\u201d Shortly after, we implement tax, and shortly after that, we implement the ES module.   R: Critically important for the community to have this discussion about its\u2019 goal. Is the goal fee clawbacks, incentivizing migration, lighting the fire on three big holders, and accepting collateral damage?     1:10:15   N: One more thing. Tax paid goes to PETH holders, not MKR holders. Ironically, the largest PETH holders are the largest CDP owners. There is an amount you get back when you pay tax. When thinking about what we want the tax to accumulate to, we have to think about that reimbursement too.   R: This parameter implements with the understanding that MKR holders need compensation for their risks managing the system. But that\u2019s not the case; it\u2019s SCD, so it\u2019s the PETH holders.   C: Does it benefit MKR holders directly/indirectly?   N: No, as an MKR holder, your incentive is to pressure people to pay back before tax parameter implements. We have to toe this line between using a large stick and wielding its responsibility.   L: You mention the communication issue, I kind of agree. If anyone gets hit by a tax, we want anyone to close their CDP beforehand, that makes sense. Will we reach 100% of CDP holders without an outpouring of blog posts? If we can\u2019t hit 100% of people, then we shouldn\u2019t apply a non-proportional tax, in my opinion.   R: Primoz points out that a lot of these CDP owners are likely inactive for a very long time.     1:13:31   C: When the tax hits, CDP owner gets back less collateral; does that mean Dai holders get more than $1\u2019s worth?   N: Dai holders are entitled to $1 of collateral. PETH owners benefit in a roundabout way: since PETH burns for tax collection, the PETH you keep has a redemption ratio with ETH that increases substantially.   L: If you get that ETH back, does that defeat avoiding the tax in the first place?   N: Not if you set tax high enough.   L: Tax goes to PETH holder, its about proportion.   D: No, we can see how much PETH the largest CDP owners have, understand their share of the total PETH pool, and approximately calculate how much ETH they will get reimbursed.   N: More of a Pareto rule here, 80/20. The amount of large CDPs with unpaid fees is quite a small group. Profiling a model around their situation is ideal.   L: You can assume that large CDP holders also have many assets, whereas smaller holders don\u2019t. If the large ones migrate and the small ones don\u2019t, you can assume proportionally it\u2019s more painful for the little guy.   N: I hate to talk in circles; it\u2019s all about the communication of the date when you set tax \u201cthis is the last day to pay back your position.\u201d   C: That could be bad for Sai liquidity, right? If tax is so onerous that everyone starts buying Sai.   N: Everyone will try to run out the door; the alternative is the current situation where large holders don\u2019t attempt to pay back their fees.   L: Do we care at this point?     1:17:10   Sam: You can open a CDP position today then and get 0% interest if we don\u2019t plug this hole with the Stability Fees.   L: So should we reduce the debt ceiling to 0 then? To prevent Dai minting.   D: I want to explore the: debt ceiling of 0, SF of 0, and no shutdown date option.   N: Mint a bunch of Sai, migrate to Dai and collect DSR. It\u2019s free money.   L:  That\u2019s why you can\u2019t keep SCD open forever because they\u2019ll just collect the DSR and not pay any fees.   N: Right now, there is $2,137,405 SF\u2019s on Sai.     1:18:05   Chris Smith: We could also shut down the migration contract so you can\u2019t move Sai to Dai when we do the 0s on SCD.  L: Sounds like an option    1:18:24   S: Any thought about liquidation ratio being arbitrarily high to force liquidations?   N: Not an option, since liquidations forgive SFs.   S: I meant as a penalty instead of a tax.   D: Liquidation penalties would all go to PETH holders.   N: For the larger CDP\u2019s that have the most fees, what they owe is larger than 13%.   S: Is it similar to the tax mechanism?   N: Not really, but can be wielded in the same way.     1:19:41   C: Let\u2019s say tax charges some amount to all PETH holders, does it redistribute in even amounts? To implement a penalty, is there some portion that goes somewhere else.   N: Good question, I need to think about it and share the math of it later.   S: Regarding the PETH returns, wouldn\u2019t people just pile into PETH to dilute the pool before the tax is applied.   L: If people can make money on PETH, they\u2019ll just do that, while we\u2019re announcing the tax loudly.   N: That would just help, though, since your incentivizing closing the CDP before tax. If their hopes are reimbursement through some proportion of PETH, and everyone piles on PETH, that makes it worse for them since they have a smaller share in the P-ETH pool.   L: It comes back to not communicating to 100% of holders.   C: Perhaps communication maybe isn\u2019t the right word, more like a business decision. What type of community do we want to have, and what type of relationship with the broader user base?   S: Maybe a lower bound of fees owed to forgive is the best option.   R: I agree with Cyrus. Is the idea to have people migrate, or does the community want those fees back? Is it because the community wants to burn MKR? Is it because the community doesn\u2019t want anyone piling into Sai? Keeping the goal in mind is important.   D: Maybe the goal can be summarized as \u201cthe effective winding down and depreciation of SCD.\u201d To do that, we need to ensure that people are leaving and aren\u2019t piling in. That you can\u2019t leave without paying.   R: No one wants to see anyone get off scot-free when everyone has been diligently paying fees. But we don\u2019t want people to game the system. We want it ensures that the system is close to the design we set for it. We need to consider what do we want to achieve and work backward from there to accomplish it.     1:24:53   V: Keeping people from trying to avoid fees is a slightly different goal than shutting down SCD in a way that protects the end-user. The only reason I\u2019ve heard for the forced migration switch-over is to eliminate the operational overhead associated with SCD.  R: I think we\u2019re on the same page. Trying to predict the impact is important. As long as we carefully examine it, move past the opinion-stage, and into the outcomes that the community looks to achieve, we should be ok. It\u2019s very important that we do this and document it well.    1:27:15   Derek: To that point, Primoz shared that CDP spreadsheet. Is there an update to that? Trying to illustrate tax as accrued interest gets harder without an updated data set. I\u2019d like to put something on the forum that details the model.   R: I\u2019d like to expand the scope beyond the foundation; it\u2019s a community issue, so we should put out a call about this to the community if anyone thinks they can be useful in helping figure this out.   D: Absolutely, happy to put in a google doc. I just want to verify if a poll is necessary.   P: Sure thing! We will push an update to include more than just the top 100.

I am the Interim Governance Facilitator, and I\u2019m joined in moderation duties with LongForWisdom, the community-selected Governance Facilitator. We have a jam-packed agenda as usual. We also have something happening today that has been on a slow boil for a long time, and I am interested in hearing this presentation. Monet Supply and MakerMan have been toiling in obscurity for a long time to work with a group of actors in the ecosystem who believe would like to be compensated for the zero-bid auction event. They have done a great deal of work with stakeholders to come up with a plan about how the Protocol could compensate the zero-bid auction individuals. They\u2019re going to be presenting that plan for the first time publicly today. I would like to encourage everyone on this call to pay close attention to this. This is a momentous event. This is one of the first sorts of a completely organic collaboration of ecosystem actors getting together to affect change in the system. We\u2019ve had it on a smaller scale before, but this is governance in action. We talk about autonomy and agency, the ecosystem shipping the protocol, but this is the probably largest. There are lots of things happening here we need to understand. They put a great deal of attention and time and effort into this. Now it\u2019s time for the governors of the system to understand what this plan is and offer their feedback to keep the ball rolling. That is my framing of this situation. I am looking forward to it. Not totally sure what\u2019s in it. It will be very educational for all of us. I encourage people also to take notes of any questions that they might have about this process, what is it going to look like in the future, and the implications. Let\u2019s make sure we get these questions asked for the official public record. Discussions happen in the Forum.   Forum Recap LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 03:40  LongForWisdom: It\u2019s been a semi-active week with the whole liquidity mining/farming going on.  Threads   Vault Compensation Plan  As Rich previously mentioned, Monet Supply and the Vault Compensation working group have posted the Vault Compensation Plan Proposal on the forum. Go check it out after the presentation. Review the details.    Liquidity Mining on the Maker Protocol  Monet Supply also created an interesting discussion on liquidity mining on the Maker protocol and included several calculations on what people could be earning and how it compares to the rates of Maker.    Wallet & CDP Liquidation-based Predictive Scoring Model  A user I hadn\u2019t seen before, ChristG87, created a thread proposing a predictive scoring model for liquidation risk, of how Maker could use a credit scoring mechanism to allow people to borrow at smaller collateralization ratios. Some interesting ideas.    Signal Requests   Signal Requests  Created by Jiecut, to adjust the wBTC debt ceiling and risk premium. It should be moving on next Monday. The consensus results were 20 million debt ceiling and a 2% risk premium. So those are going to be the values going into the polls.    Vault Compensation Monet_Supply and MakerMan Vault Compensation Plan Presentation 06:53 Deck Cover1369\u00d7770 92.3 KB  This is the initial presentation for the Vault Compensation Plan Proposal for Maker Governance. MakerMan and I haven\u2019t rehearsed this presentation before, so if you want to hop in at any moment, or if anyone has any questions, please let us know. Before we get into the details, there\u2019s a small disclaimer.  942\u00d7528 156 KB  I\u2019ll let everyone read independently. The intention here is that we\u2019re not working under the purview of the Foundation or another corporation. We want to make sure we\u2019re communicating the limits. That\u2019s included in the plan document itself.  Background of Compensation Claims1333\u00d7750 164 KB  A little bit of background, although I assume most are aware. This plan is essentially the procedure for how we are going to determine those details as a community.  Compensation Plan Elements1337\u00d7752 142 KB MKR Holder Declaration1330\u00d7749 63.9 KB Disclaimer940\u00d7528 163 KB  We are trying to convey to the public and vault holders that this is an exceptional circumstance, and we don\u2019t want to create an expectation that these claims are going to end up falling on MKR holders in the future.  MakerMan: Let me add one thing. Go to the end of this slide: \u201cThe persons drafting or implementing this compensation plan maintain that the MKR holders have no obligation to issue any compensation\u2026\u201d This is a volunteer plan operated solely at your(MKR Voter\u2019s) discretion, and there is nothing in here that says that if you agree on wanting to do it that you will actually execute on that. We are very clear about this. This is an optional plan. Everybody opts-in, the governance opts-in, vault holders can opt-in by going yay or nay to terms and compensation. Monet Supply: I think it\u2019s important to include this. We don\u2019t want to create expectations that we are not able to follow through on in the future. So we want to be super clear about where MKR holders feel their rights and responsibilities are.    Proposed Stages1176\u00d7658 40.7 KB  I\u2019m going to walk you through the proposed stages of this compensation plan. It is going to involve some Governance action and some kind of project management and development work as well.  Phase 0947\u00d7530 89.1 KB  The first phase is the current state - phase zero.  Develop a plan of action Present it to governance and getting feedback here as well as in the forums Eventually, we are going to put it in an on-chain governance poll for MKR holders to signal whether they support the plan as stated or not. The earliest that could run potentially, if there is support for it at this point, would be this coming Monday. But if people want more time to discuss, it could certainly be delayed from there. If the poll passes, we are going to be moving to phase 1, the next phase. If the poll fails, we basically need to figure out from MKR holders and the community overall what part of it was contentious, and then we can dig into how to fix it and gain the necessary support. That is mainly why we included the icebox section. It\u2019s stuff that, when we were drafting the plan, we thought of it as potential questions that governance might want to decide on but, in our opinion, it was simpler to narrow the scope of the governance voting, but that would be probably the course of action if this plan fails to gain support.   Now assuming that it does gain enough support from MKR holders, we are going to be moving on to phase one. LFW: I think it\u2019s very unlikely that the poll will go up this Monday. We would like to give people more time to digest and understand the plan before voting on it.  Monet Supply: I think that is fair. There hasn\u2019t been a whole lot of discussion on the post, so I would love more feedback and people catching our blind spots before we move forward. I will scratch this when I post the deck, but we can push it another week or two or as long as needed.    Phase 1943\u00d7531 113 KB  Once we get the governance poll up and assuming it does pass, phase 1, where we have two main things:  Firstly, we need to do a governance poll to determine the calculation method, which we call the method in reference price for determining compensation. Next slide, I will add more info on that, and I will probably have MakerMan pop in as well. Parallel to that, the compensation itself is going to need to be distributed to vaults via smart contracts and then based on verified data about who suffered what losses and what-have-you. So, in parallel, while we are getting Governance to poll on this info or this question, we are also going to be trying to put out for tender(price discovery) some of that development work that is going to be necessary later in the process. So we can at least understand how much that will cost and how much governance is going to need to stump up for that.   Maker Man: I will take over the next section. When talking about compensation, I came up with two different methods. The tab one, I was hoping I could just run across everybody and give a total number. It\u2019s just the data isn\u2019t there. So there are two ways we can look at this:  From the borrow perspective, which I call the tab, and what happened with them.  When these vault users borrowed, they set their tab value, so you can use that as a really good measure of what they were thinking about their collateral. Otherwise, you can look at it from what we think is a collateral deficit, and then it\u2019s what is the value that you want to put on it: at the time of the auction or ideally just one number for everybody.   MakerMan: In this case, we have options A, B, and C. Is it the price on the day it happened that we pick or the price on the day we finally execute it or an average of those? MakerMan: Then, I had the tab change in relation to collateral change. Because when I started looking at these numbers even for the guy that self-liquidated and saved the system probably a half a million Dai-loss(vault 2288.) You look at him, and it works out for him too. He gets numbers, and they all line-up and so they all become manageable when you think about it from this perspective. So we just offer the different methods for choice for Governance.  943\u00d7527 135 KB  Monet Supply: This next page is for the less math-inclined people. Kind of a narrative version of how it would be calculated. Starting off by figuring out what percentage of the collateral they have gotten back and then the collateral rate percentage that MKR voters choose. You take what they have already received and subtract it from that. That\u2019s how you figure out the percentage of the collateral that they are going to be getting.  Nominal Return 22:22  Basically, remember, I calculated this nominal return. The liquidation ratio and the fee determine the nominal return, and you can look at the auctions\u2019 stuff and determine where you think auctions were good and where you think they were bad and then what you want to do. So you just use the collateral deficit as the relevant means of dealing with the zero vaults. However, you want to classify your vaults, take a pick.  Tab Change  And then I had done some work that you could also look at it from the tab change. Like if they are liquidated, their tab goes to zero, and their collateral goes up for auction, and you could look at it from that perspective as well and just compensate with respect to tab. And that actually works out, when I think about it, as an MKR holder, a much cleaner concept of what I\u2019m trying to do here, why it\u2019s a separate issue. But those are the two ways to do it.  Example940\u00d7526 110 KB   Monet Supply: I\u2019ll post the slides as well, and then this next page also has more numerical examples of what those different options would look like. These are two vaults. One self-liquidated (vault 2288), the other who was liquidated at auction (vault 3834). Just to recall what those different A, B, C, and D options: (back to \u201cPhase 1\u201d slide)  A: nominal collateral return percentage and the price on Black Thursday B: same and the future day when the compensation is awarded C: the average D: the tab method   If you look back at what the numbers would be, assuming that price on Black Thursday is $100 and price the day that we issue the compensation is $240, you can see what the relative numbers would be. Which option we choose here will have a big impact. If we choose option B, which is using the ETH price whenever we actually issued the compensation, it\u2019s likely going to be a lot more than the other options. On the other hand, vaults which might have expected to receive some of their ETH back, so if we paid them back according to the price on Black Thursday, it might not seem as fair to them. So probably the biggest single decision that Governance has as part of this process is to decide what method we are going to be using to calculate the claims.  Rich Brown: Just to clarify, this is the opportunity cost of waiting for the compensation plan to finish. Monet_Supply: Sort of. It\u2019s us, as MKR holders, taking on the risk of ETH price going up in the interim. Now, if the price went down, if it crashed again, potentially, we would be off the hook. Rich: We\u2019re assuming that the price of ETH is always going to be better than whatever happened on Black Thursday. It\u2019s interesting. Monet Supply: It\u2019s a pretty fair assumption, but you never know. Any other questions on this slide before I move forward?   Rich Brown: let\u2019s clarify what self-liquidated vs. auction means. Actually, I think that we all understand what auction means. Can you talk a bit more about what self-liquidated is?  Monet Supply: Yes. In the case of vault 2288 but kind of all of them, they probably got paged on Black Thursday for their price alerts for ETH, and then they either just wanted to avoid the liquidation penalty, or maybe they realized that the auctions were not working as intended. So then they basically panic-bought back their Dai at really high prices, panic-sold their ETH just to be able to close up the leverage positions themselves. MakerMan: They did this to salvage some parts of their vaults, like 2288, he salvaged 585 ETH rather than being totally liquidated and getting stuck sitting there with nothing and not doing anything. And the system losing another half a million Dai on this vault alone. Rich Brown: It\u2019s not about motivation; it\u2019s about the mechanism. These people just chose to close out their positions, and they spent more than they should have in order to do that? Or these people attempted to close their positions and were liquidated at some point during that process? MakerMan: He closed and sold like 2000 ETH at $76. It was like 2,200 at 76 or 75 just to raise enough Dai to salvage the ETH. Rich Brown: I just want to be clear. So we have this category of people called self-liquidated. So these people that completely bought ETH in the open market to close-up their positions, or does this include people that attempted to rescue but were also liquidated at some point during that process? MakerMan: This is only one example. Money Supply: Theoretically, you could be in both groups. The self-liquidating is basically selling ETH to pay back Dai, and the auction is that when you hit the liquidation ratio and got sent to auction. Rich Brown: Are those mutually exclusive groups, or is there a combination of the two? Monet Supply: Theoretically, somebody could have paid back some of their debt, and then the price kept falling, and they got auctioned. MakerMan: I already know from looking at examples of people who deposit their ETH and then got liquidated. I was looking through the first 500 vaults, and there were a number of examples where people tried to stave it off and then just got liquidated straight up and deposited ETH or whatever. Rich Brown: That\u2019s an interesting distinction, but we should definitely keep going. Thanks, Monet. Monet Supply: Definitely. And that is part of the icebox as well, whether or not we are going to include them. So if people have thoughts and they don\u2019t think they should be included, it\u2019s certainly not my opinion, but it\u2019s definitely open for discussion, and we can clarify further on the thread in the forum.   That encompasses phase one, where we chose the compensation method and then put out some of the development work that we are going to need in the future for quotes.  29:29 Phase 21726\u00d7967 195 KB  Phase two, the main governance decision here will be determining the compensation percentage.  So we recall from the previous slide. The compensation percentage determines what their collateral deficit is. Because in the example I selected 18%, the person already got 11% back and is going to get another 6%. That\u2019s going to have a big impact on how much compensation individual vaults receive. One thing that will be made clear in the poll, of course, the plan we have is to pre-calculate all the compensation amounts for ETH vaults-holders that were liquidated at auction. Since the BAT auctions and also individuals who self-liquidated require a little bit more manual review, we are going to ask Governance eventually for 150% of the token calculated for ETH liquidation. With the additional 50% to cover claims for BAT auctions and for self-liquidated vaults. Any unused funds, of course, are going to be going back to Governance, which I will describe a little bit further forward.   So we will have a Governance poll to determine the compensation percentage, and from here, once we already have enough quotes for the necessary development work that we need to do to create the compensation contracts, we are going to put an on-chain poll up and an executive vote to request funding for that development work.  I know that just recently, the MIP14 Protocol Dai Transfer did not go through. So it seems pretty evident that Governance has some reservations about sending money outside the protocol. It is going to be 100% necessary to do that and to make this plan work, so there is no getting around it. So anyone who does have reservations on this, definitely make your thoughts known in the forum. Any ideas about how we can help Governance feel safe about moving funds out of the Protocol.   Then the end of Phase two, once we\u2019ve gotten funding approved and issued for the development work, that\u2019s when we basically get down to business, develop and audit the smart contract for dispersing compensation to users. We have some more specifications on that in a little bit. This is one bullet point, but this may well take a while. So I think I would note that. It could be a while to go from phase two to phase three before we actually have a working contract that\u2019s safe and ready to put funds into.  34:18 Phase 3937\u00d7529 102 KB  Once we do have the smart contract created and ready to go, again: this is moving funds out of the protocol, and it\u2019s going to be a potentially large amount. But we are proposing to have an on-chain poll to include funding of the compensation contract into the next executive and then an executive vote to actually issue it to the compensation contract. Something to bear in mind, which is kind of obvious, but the compensation amount could be hundreds of thousands if not millions of Dai, so it could result in flop auctions if there is not enough Dai in the surplus buffer after the vote passes. So we didn\u2019t suggest to include any sort of strategy about how to collect the funds for the compensation, but it\u2019s something that governance might want to consider. Once the contract has been funded, then we go to the claims period where vaults are actually able to retrieve the compensation. Prospectively we are thinking of having the claim period extent for approximately three months, potentially a little bit longer at the discretion of governance. Then, any funds that haven\u2019t been claimed from the compensation contract at the end of that period, Maker governance would then have an executive vote to claim those back into the surplus buffer. Any ETH vaults are going to be already pre-coded into the contract with whatever their amount is based on the methods and percentage polls earlier so they\u2019ll just be able to go to either interact directly with a contract or go to a website to claim. It\u2019ll be simple for them.  Phase 3 Cont941\u00d7523 87.5 KB  Then, for individuals who self-liquidated or BAT vaults who were auctioned, they aren\u2019t going to be pre-coded into the contract to receive funds. They will need to submit details of their claim within 30 days to a forum thread and then the compensation review team, the working group, is going to be manually reviewing those and determining, based on the method and the compensation percentage determined by MKR voters, how much each one of those vaults will receive. The perspective idea of how we thought we would add those individuals to the contract would be basically to have an admin function controlled by a multi-sig, and having a timelock of roughly a week so that if we approve adding a certain compensation amount, but it looks like it\u2019s not correct to MKR holders, they would have the ability to reclaim all the funds from the compensation contract before it\u2019s dispersed. At the end of the 90-day claims period, when anyone who wants to claim funds has, MKR governance would call the contract to self-destruct and return all funds. The flip side of the flop auctions earlier is that if there is a bunch of surplus that comes back, it could lead to immediate flap auctions.  33:37 Phase 4939\u00d7525 52.5 KB  Phase four, where basically once the compensation has been claimed, MKR governance just takes all the remaining funds back. I know MakerMan had put this in the forum post on the plan as well, but there\u2019s a good possibility that only maybe 50%, or whatever, of the approved compensation, is going to be claimed by vaults, or certainly less than 100%. So that is something to bear in mind as far as the total cost goes.  Compensation Process940\u00d7525 84.4 KB  This is like the TL;DR version of that whole compensation process.  Appendices1176\u00d7658 30.8 KB  The appendices section can be found towards the bottom of the initial post of this forum thread.   Icebox940\u00d7529 102 KB  These are different potential questions that we didn\u2019t include as poll votes or stuff that we\u2019re proposing to MKR voters, but potentially MKR governance might want to vote on these if they decide that the plan isn\u2019t really fit for purpose as of now. I encourage everyone to consider if they think there\u2019s anything missing in the plan that they want to vote on or just look over the icebox and see if there is anything there that sparks your interest.  SC Specifications937\u00d7524 110 KB  I\u2019m just going to skip over that, but there is a github link in the plan which Joshua had made, specifying what we need the contract to do. Any feedback people have to offer on that would be appreciated. Just speaking for myself, I\u2019m not super technical, so people with more experience, I would definitely love to hear your thoughts.  Working Group Payment940\u00d7527 89.1 KB  As of about a week and a half ago, we had around 100 hours tally total. I was proposing a rate of compensation of 50 Dai per hour, it seems pretty reasonable, maybe cheap for professional services, but it\u2019s up to the discretion of MKR voters. I think none of us in the working group are doing this first and foremost to be paid, but that being said, I think it\u2019s good to set a precedence of paying for work. Based on this amount of time and that pay rate, it\u2019s about 5,000 of cost so far, and we would still need to determine the cost for these additional items, but I expect it to be a very small portion of the total amount of approved compensation that gets voted through.

                    "content": " Discussion 1  Analysis on the zero-bidders 19:05  chris_p: One of the things that no one has mentioned yet about this compensation plan is, what about some analysis on the people that took advantage of the system by placing all the zero-bids?  Monet Supply: I think it\u2019s out of scope for compensating the vaults. MakerMan: You need to define what \u201ctaking advantage is\u201d because for people to borrow Dai, they have to put up collateral, right? And this is a contract, and they get to manage it. What\u2019s the point, Chris? I don\u2019t understand. chris_p: If you\u2019re talking about compensation here, fund recovery is important. We should explore all paths on how to get that money back. If we could contact the zero-bidders and say \u201cHey, would you mind giving the money back?\u201d if there was some kind of negotiation there, in addition to paying people out, that should be discussed. MakerMan: Let me give you an example. Coinbase had a little price drop. My wife pointed this out: \u201cWho are we to say what the right option was?\u201d You could debate the way it worked. The same thing happened to Coinbase; what did they do? They ate those losses and made people whole, but that was their choice, right? Rich: There\u2019s a lot to go over. We have a plan that took months to put together. There are a lot of things to digest. Let me do some moderation here. Chris has a point, and that\u2019s something that the community might be interested in getting into. It\u2019s not about judgment; it\u2019s about exploration. If the community is interested in aligning some efforts to filling the other piece of the puzzle, I don\u2019t see anything stopping them from doing that. So this is a conversation that can be continued in the forum. I don\u2019t imagine it takes much time to determine exactly where all these funds ended up. It\u2019s worth exploring. I would really like to focus on the actual details on these slides before we start diverging into philosophy about blame and who won and who lost.     MIP14 and Working Group Payment 32:26  Rich Brown: MIP14, we have talked about this in the last call too, and it\u2019s worth revisiting, so if people have concerns or questions, please look at MIP14 again to get the necessary context. Rich Brown: Second question or observation; you mentioned briefly at the end of the slide previously about the compensation that is going to be needed for the work that went into doing all this evaluation. I want to make sure that that\u2019s not lost. Because you guys don\u2019t have a horse in this race, I\u2019m assuming, and you all put in a significant amount of work here. So, are you guys going to get compensated as well?  Monet Supply: Yes. In the end, one of the appendix sections is \u201cworking group payment.\u201d We are going to be recording all of the various costs. Rich Brown: Good, I just want to make sure that you guys are not shy. Monet Supply: No. It\u2019s totally up to governance, of course. MakerMan: We threw that in the end because it\u2019s such a small quantity in comparison to the total that it\u2019s going to be looked at here, that it felt appropriate. Monet Supply: Yes, and I think it\u2019s really up to Governance whether they approve it.     Thanks to the working team 42:04  Rich Brown: I want to thank you to Monet Supply, MakerMan, and anyone else whose name I forget that may have contributed to the effort. It was a tremendous amount of work. I encourage people to dig into the full document and the forum thread as well. We have a lot to cover today, but I don\u2019t want to end this conversation prematurely, so if people have questions, please jump on the mic.   Fix Amount and Issuing Equity 42:40  Joseph Q: I just want to thank them because they did a great job on it. I\u2019m ok with everything. My only question is, \u201cwhy not instead of doing flop auctions, why can\u2019t we just say we agree to an amount?\u201d It\u2019s in your appendices, the icebox. Just do it over time as the system makes money because the system is not making any money right now. And then we do a flop auction. The whole point of MKR being an asset that could be auctioned off, and have stability on it; we would crash the MKR price, I believe.  Monet Supply: My thought on that is that maybe we don\u2019t need to be as hesitant with issuing equity as we think we do necessarily. Compound just voted to dilute themselves by like 80%. It\u2019s not a direct comparison, but I think it would end up feeling stingy to the vault owners if we basically just said, \u201cwe\u2019ll get to it when we get to it.\u201d Joseph: The VCs will sell, and I\u2019ll tell you that right now. Do you want MKR to be trading at $100 dollars? That is the blunt reality. My guess is that compensation would be like $2 million. MKR is trading at $470 right now. If this gets to governance, then they\u2019ll dump it, and they will bid on the flop auctions. Rich Brown: I\u2019m not sure about it. There\u2019s a spectrum for these things. It\u2019s obviously worth exploring, and maybe even a model of what we would have. First, people need to vote about which levels of compensations they\u2019re interested in, and then after that potentially scheduling. It seems like there\u2019s a pile of options and people who are more clever than I can come up with the best options that would minimize the impact on MKR. It\u2019s an interesting discussion.   Rich Brown: Something that we need to understand sooner rather than later, for true agency to occur, there needs to be some method of funding, to control their own destinies. We have talked about MIP14; that\u2019s going to get us beyond helping the people that did the work. But at some point, there needs to be a process to pay for things. And this seems to be the instigator to make sure that we get to a plan that actually works. This is going to be an interesting couple of months. I\u2019m going to ask people again. This is really interesting stuff. It has impacts on our ecosystem; it has impacts on our culture; it has impacts on the perception of the Foundation externally. It has an impact on the people that engage with our ecosystem as well and suffered a lot. There are lots of things to be discussed here. Please engage in the forums.   MIPS  Charles St. Louis  Weekly Update Weekly MIPs Update Forum Posts 46:37  Executive Vote  We\u2019re in the last week of June\u2019s governance cycle. The executive vote went live on Monday to officially ratify the six proposals which covered amendments, onboarding a risk team, and the Declaration of Intent MIP. I\u2019ll share the link right here. The important thing to know is that the executive vote has four days to pass, as of Monday, when it started. The proposals can only move to accepted status if the executive vote passes within that time limit. So, this is a reminder to go and vote. There are still approximately 11,000 MKR needed to pass(vote now passed.)   Governance Cycle Review  As for today\u2019s business, after my update, Rich and LongForWisdom are going to do the Governance Cycle Review, which is a time to summarize and discuss June\u2019s governance cycle with the community. It can also be used to discuss any upcoming activity for the governance cycle in July, which includes any potential submissions. I\u2019ll definitely use some of that time to take a moment to speak briefly about a new MIP submission plan for July that we\u2019ve been working on.   July\u2019s Governance Cycle deadline  The formal submission period for the July governance cycle is July 8th. If you have any proposals in progress, post them in the forums and get the review sooner rather than later.   Light Feed Proposals  In other news, the whitelisting oracles and new light feeds proposals that passed the governance poll stage will likely be put in an executive vote within the next week or so. I\u2019m not sure about the exact date, but that will be included in the forum update that I\u2019ll post later.  This Executive Vote will be going up on Friday, July 03rd.     Collateral Onboarding  In terms of collateral onboarding, the executive vote for KNC and ZRX will go live tomorrow. The new community greenlight polls are live and will run for approximately 11 more days. The polls are for gauging the sentiment about adding:  LEND MATIC PAXG LYNC ENJ WKT   I do want to note that if the amendment MIPs that pass this month exec are ratified, the community greenlight polls will start in the third week of the governance cycle and end at the end of the governance cycle as opposed to carrying over to the next month\u2019s cycle. This improves the flow of the overall collateral onboarding process, so it\u2019s important to get this in to improve the flow.   MIPs Forum Subcategory: Proposal Ideas  The MIPs forum subcategory Proposal Ideas has an update. It has a new entry by Andy McCall, and it\u2019s for adding a poll to prioritize collateral applications. Here\u2019s the link. The proposal ideas category is where community members can post and discuss any proposal ideas to improve Maker, the protocol, or the governance system. I encourage everyone to vote and go to the forums.   Governance Cycle Review  LongForWisdom  Overview 50:21  We started this month with nine proposals that we submitted in the initial submission period:  MIP13: Declaration of Intent MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer Four amendment MIPs, amending parts of the collateral onboarding process A subproposal to add Cyrus as a risk team Two MIP12 subproposals to onboard KNC and ZRX Vault types   In terms of stuff that we ended up accepting into the governance cycle, that ended up being everything except the MIP12 subproposals because they didn\u2019t contain all the domain work that was required to make them valid for the MIP process. So Charles said that\u2019s being pursued under the weekly cycle for this month.   Inclusion Polls  Seven proposals went into the inclusion polls. The outcome of the inclusion polls is that six of those continued to the governance poll. The only one that did not make it was MIP14, as we discussed. So there are six up for vote in the executive out of the nine proposals, which is reasonable.   MKR Voters in Polls  Comparing the first cycle to the second. We had one submission in the first month, versus nine submissions in the second. In the first month, we saw around 5k MKR voting in inclusion polls. This month, it was more like 17k, which is interesting. In the second poll, the governance poll bundle, the amount of MKR was around 5k the first month and 4k the second month. That indicates that MKR voters are finding that poll less important or less impactful. I encourage everyone to vote in it because if it gets voted down, on the stage, then it doesn\u2019t continue. It\u2019s potentially a signal that MKR holders view that this stage of Governance Polls are too much effort.   July\u2019s Governance Cycle  Charles already commented on it briefly. There are currently two MIPs in Request for Comments:  MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism   I don\u2019t believe any of these will be submitted for the next cycle, although I could be wrong. There\u2019s potentially some other stuff coming from the Foundation to be submitted as well. I encourage everyone that has MIP ideas or is in the process of writing MIPs to submit them as soon as possible.   Liquidations  Mariano Conti  Liquidations v1.1 with the Smart Contracts Team 55:10  Flopper contract fix and impacts  As you know, when we did the flop auctions, some of them got stuck, so we discovered there is a small bug in the flopper contract. During that, we also realized that the three different auction contracts: the flip, flop, and flap (or collateral, debt, and surplus auctions) require double liquidity when interacting with them in certain cases. That is already fixed, tested, and formally verified. As well as the flopper with the stop-debt auctions. We plan on fixing those in the next governance cycle, and that would imply deploying new versions of all of these contracts. This is a change that impacts everybody running a keeper like DeFi Saver, for example, with their UIs. But, to be clear, the only impact is that they would need to point to new smart contracts, so nothing in the interface changes.   Timing  We wanted to do this for these weeks, so that the new collateral types, KNC and ZRX, would deploy with the same fix. But we decided that we better put it out to a community. This is not an emergency but an upgrade. We are going to put it out next week in the forum, with all the information: the smart contracts and the result of the formal verification. Hopefully, it is not a controversial change, and we can get to vote on it at the end of next month.   Analysis  Vishesh  Relevant Links MCD system stats DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs  The State of the Peg 58:17  1447\u00d7767 146 KB   Total Dai is at $130 million, so it\u2019s not a significant change. USDC-B and TUSD have been added as empty buckets, with that being the plan for USDC-B, and TUSD having a surprise token contract upgrade that requires a fix before being usable.   1626\u00d7799 66.7 KB   Dai from WBTC is sitting flat since it hit its capacity. It\u2019s probably not going to move since it\u2019s a few individual users. Unless they decide to change their plan or the DC gets moved.   1630\u00d7802 101 KB   Dai from BAT down over the last few days. It\u2019s obvious why, but we can go into that. Also, it\u2019s not a huge margin to begin with.   1630\u00d7802 101 KB   Dai from USDC hasn\u2019t moved much in the last couple of weeks, but it\u2019s come down since May. That utilization isn\u2019t expected to move, given the current ecosystem for lending (I don\u2019t think). That has basically come down since SF was moved off of zero. A lot of that utilization was either temporary or due to the fact that it was effectively free money.   1603\u00d7794 86.7 KB   Dai from ETH has been growing; there were a few spikes. Those spikes were not particularly sustainable, so they leveled out, and it resumed the normal growth path. This was some refinancing to Compound. Then basically it\u2019s been a slow but steady increase since it dipped back down, about a week ago. It\u2019s still sitting at around $116 million Dai from ETH.   1574\u00d7679 149 KB   In the context of the peg, trading volumes have been somewhat light but still sustained.   1613\u00d7747 143 KB   The Dai peg had come back to about $1.01 after dipping down a bit lower, and then it\u2019s just slowly gotten closer to the $1 mark since then. Partly that\u2019s explained by the supply increase and partly from what\u2019s been going on with ETH price.   1608\u00d7656 180 KB   Following the (blue) lines of the ETH price, you can see the (magenta) Dai price level off during fluctuations. Though during a spike in ETH, Dai price didn\u2019t change as quickly. These fluctuations have been too frequent and too small for Dai peg users to purchase back on the market. It didn\u2019t create a huge shift in market behavior with Dai. It\u2019s also good to keep in mind that during this time frame, there was a little bit more Dai minted, but significantly more Dai supplied to Compound in the same time frame. This pulls from circulating supply.   1567\u00d7739 90.2 KB   If you look at the minting of ETH from June 15th up to today, you can correspondingly see that increase of supply on Compound. Even if the circulating supply has gone down, the volume of trades occurring at elevated prices did not increase.   1218\u00d7668 88.8 KB   If we look at borrows on Compound, they\u2019ve increased but not as much.   1290\u00d7681 77.1 KB   In the same time frame, supply had a $13 to $16 million increase, depending on the day you pick. There\u2019s a bit more Dai that was supplied than borrowed. Even though liquidity should have decreased, the Dai price didn\u2019t increase, but actually decreased. Both when ETH went up and went down. Just a bit odd, a curious indicator.   Discussion 3  Double Dip 1:04:32  MakerMan: There\u2019s the first dip on June 12th, and the peg actually went down. Just like it\u2019s doing on the first dip here. Whereas the second dip, it bounced back, June 14th, and then it went down again. That\u2019s when we really got the spike. The first dip didn\u2019t do anything. So, maybe, it\u2019s the double-dip.  Vishesh: Well, it\u2019s all relative. ETH had been going up from 200 all the way to 240. And then there are fluctuations, but there are small in comparison to the larger movement. So these can be considered everyday fluctuations. At that point, the market had not necessarily made any decisions about what to do with their Dai. MakerMan: Well, you see what the trading did there. There is a spike down in the volume and a change around the average. Vishesh: There always been small run up and down events. These are smaller volume trades. It sometimes helps to look at some the larger trades on this graphic:     1608\u00d7656 180 KB   Vishesh: a lot of the trades are happening around peg even when the ETH price is elevated. Around June 14th, the price of ETH goes down, so people are less secure of what happens, and Dai purchasing occurs. It\u2019s not only about ETH-downward\u2019s movement, but also when that movement is sustained, and it could potentially lead to liquidations. That is the moment when people start to buy back in order to protect their positions. I don\u2019t want to belabor that point too much, but basically, it snapped back into this traditional inverse relationship, except in the last few days, where it broke from that a little bit. And it\u2019s been coming down anyway. That\u2019s a bit odd since there are large chunks of Dai that have been funneled straight into Compound\u2019s supply.   Yield Farming 1:09:06  Rich: Was frothiness introduced by the yield farming craze? Do you think that\u2019s the explanation here, or is there something else?  Vishesh: The \u201cyield farming craze\u201d effect on Dai is what I\u2019m talking about. The result of what\u2019s happening there is a bit contrary to what you might expect. Yes, there is more borrowing on Compound, but there\u2019s more supply, which is outpacing borrow. So theoretically, for the moment, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s effectively a higher interest rate for supplying on Compound. We know what happens in those situations because that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen before. COMP is effectively another unit of account where people are earning a yield for this behavior. That could, economically, be thought of as an increased interest rate. If you\u2019re earning a higher supply rate on Compound if high enough, they can mint Dai on Maker and supply straight into Compound. It appears there\u2019s a lot of that going on. But also, generally speaking, they keep positions open, which continue to lever up and choose to eat any SF or Dai premiums in order to get access to those yields. That\u2019s the kind of stuff that we\u2019ve seen in the past from Dai users. Even with all that going on, what you\u2019d expect is the Dai price to rise, but it hasn\u2019t in that same time frame. So I think that\u2019s interesting. Monet Supply: Depending on how Compound changes its incentive structure, that could have a big impact on Dai minting. There has been a discussion about incentivizing ETH deposits. That could change the game. Vishesh: The one thing to note is let\u2019s say the yield for COMP isn\u2019t quite as good for Dai. That potentially reduces the amount of borrow and supply on Compound. It\u2019s not clear how that would affect Dai, if at all. It may not have an impact on the peg if they are symmetric effects. If they\u2019re asymmetric, they could have an effect either way. As it stands, it appears to be somewhat symmetric. Monet Supply: Even if the peg doesn\u2019t get impacted, I think the open interest on ETH<>DAI borrowing could move and make everything more unpredictable at that point.     How COMP affects the peg 01:13:45  MakerMan: I was going to follow up on Vishesh\u2019s analysis. It looks like the price on COMP is affecting rates. Does anyone see anything that could broadside us here? It looks like it\u2019s driving a rate seeking engine in a weird way that doesn\u2019t seem normal from a money supply perspective.  Rich: I second that question. I would like to hear more. This whole yield farming thing makes me nervous, and my main concern is how it affects Dai. Vishesh: There are two separate questions there. One is, how does it affect Dai? The other one is, how does this affect lending markets? For the second one, we need another one-hour call to go over. Regarding Dai, as I said, at the moment, the impact appears to be balanced. There are lots of open interest on both sides there. The simple question is, is there risk? The answer is, \u201cof course.\u201d Can we pinpoint how that risk mess with Dai markets? Very unpredictable right now. If something changes with those rates and they become more asymmetrical, then it could have a significant effect on the peg, in either direction. A not very realistic example, if it becomes more profitable to supply Dai on Compound than it is to borrow, then you would see liquidity for Dai dry up, pushing the peg upward. Until it becomes not so profitable anymore, and then you see a surge in liquidity and the peg goes the opposite direction, downward. So the point is that it adds a degree of peg risk and, in particular, a degree of dependency on the profitability of those behaviors on Compound. That\u2019s the impact that secondary lending markets have always had on Dai. Whatever is initially profitable will either dry up liquidity or dump a bunch of Dai on the market. It seems either way. Also, these kinds of yields don\u2019t seem to last. But it adds the potential for instability. MakerMan: That\u2019s what I was going to say. If you double the number of opposing forces, you double the amount of volatility, loosely speaking\u2014the pressure of volatility. So maybe we\u2019ll see higher volatility on the peg.   MakerMan: Another thing, in terms of vaults, is; we\u2019ve seen the BAT vaults and how it pulled BAT from the system. I\u2019m wondering if they switch it to ETH, is it going to start pulling ETH? Is it about vault risk if someone has a better market for ETH? Think of it from all sides. It\u2019s not only the Dai risk. What happens to the business side too. I\u2019m trying to digest it and see what\u2019s giving me, given gas prices and everything.  Vishesh: The types of users chasing yield on BAT are not necessarily the same that supply ETH to Maker for leverage on ETH. They\u2019re potentially two different types of users engaging in different types of behavior. Just because Maker is one system doesn\u2019t mean all users and collateral are the same. Actually, it\u2019s more the opposite. The types of users for USDC are very different from the types of users that use ETH. I would imagine the same is true for BAT. Yes, the BAT collateral supply was significantly reduced in the past week or so. But, it wasn\u2019t large, to begin with. So you have to ask yourself, are you going to use a percentage or a nominal basis? $400,000 worth of BAT is potentially not a large movement. So there\u2019s a question on how much to read into that. MakerMan: It was just a note. I agree with you about the size of BAT. More about \u201cwhat if that starts happening with ETH?\u201d It was more of a general question of how it drives behavior. I was already a Compound user, and I posted on their Discord that it would be nice if they took the previous interest, for the last period, and figure that out for all their users, and as they\u2019re dispensing interest block-by-block for all the new stuff coming in, portion some chunk of it to the BAT users, so they get a forward payment on the COMP. It could be a proposal, but it\u2019s own thing, but looked wacky and would drive a lot of weird stuff. There\u2019s like 700 million in addition on Compound right now, just driving the whole thing.     Outro  Rich Brown 1:21:04  I think we might be at the end. I\u2019ll wrap things up. I want to take this time and publicly thank Monet_Supply and MakerMan for the work they did on the Compensation Plan and compiling an intention into a project plan. Coming up with a project, largely on your own, is a thankless task. It\u2019s onerous. It requires a lot of work. I would like to thank you on behalf of the ecosystem. Please follow up in the forums, read the document that they\u2019ve posted and comment if you have opinions. Thanks, everyone, for showing up. Talk to you next week!

DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance 02:31   We\u2019ve been iterating on what the Governance process looks like. Happily the process is improving all the time. So long as we keep iterating and improving, we are doing a great job in my opinion. Improvement by iteration is the only way forward. We\u2019ve been talking about the Asset Priority Poll for a couple of weeks now. Through the Governance Thread discussion and polls we\u2019ve come to an agreement on how to conduct the poll for August 12th(or early-to-mid next week).  19%: Option 1, One poll for all the assets 43%: Option 2, Yes/No Poll for each Asset <-- Winner! 38%: Option 3, Weighting poll for each asset   The low voter turnout (21 voters) is worth noting. This brings up questions about whether we want to move in the direction of minimum participation necessary for things to count, etc. These are things the community needs to start thinking about. The philosophy of this process is worth highlighting. The Foundation provided some options, and the community gave a clear signal. The Foundation is dedicated to radical transparency. We want to give the community information as it comes. The problem is that there are a lot of moving pieces and because of that making predictions about release dates and other time-specific information is hard. We can do our best, but the expectations need to be set accordingly. We will soon be posting some dates about things that will need to happen pre-MCD launch, and it is important to understand that this information is subject to change: dates will be moved, things may be removed or added, etc.  Cyrus Asset Priority List 14:16  It\u2019s important to have this list for two reasons, both concern scalability:   The Risk side: There is an enormous amount of work that goes into collateral evaluations. Risk teams need to be told what they should focus on.  People don\u2019t realize how much work goes into collateral assessment. There is qualitative assessment and quantitative modeling involved for each individual assets. Additionally, because we are doing this in a decentralized fashion while trying to uphold the ideal of scientific governance, this adds a lot of overhead. All of this data and analysis will need to be released publicly, discussed, and voted on by Maker Governance. There are currently seven collateral types in the initial potential set, but in the pipeline there are dozens of other collateral assets ready to be added as well. Until we can scale out risk teams to handle more throughput for evaluations. For now it will take time to go through each asset one by one. The main question this poll addresses is, \u201cHow does a risk team decide on which asset to evaluate first?\u201d Our goal in the internal risk team is to hit as many of these 7 assets before MCD launch. The process will be to go through them one by one. We would rather put out 3 high quality reports rather than putting out 7 mediocre reports.    The MakerDAO side: Governance at MakerDAO has limitations for how much it can deal with at any one time. A one-by-one approach is necessary to produce high quality results.  It might be dangerous to add too many collateral types at once. If something goes wrong it may be difficult to concentrate and precisely figure out how to remedy issues. I recommend a slow and steady approach to adding collateral. In voting on this poll, you want to think about which asset will bring MKR the most value. Value is brought by including collateral that is most likely to result in a healthy source of Dai supply.   Asset Priority Polls will happen in the future as well with more options.  Questions for Cyrus   21:28: What\u2019s the average time it will take to evaluate one single asset?  It\u2019s difficult to say because it depends on the size of the team. Currently the team is Vishesh, Primoz, and Myself. We are collaborating on the ETH risk evaluation. Additionally, the way Risk models are designed to be submitted adds additional overhead. A lot of documentation needs to exist around frameworks, ideas, and academic research as well. This might be a one-time fixed cost on our side, nevertheless this is being created currently. Each additional collateral asset may move faster. Though in the future, with new asset types that require different nuances in their evaluations will have to produce documentation to make those differences public. At a good level of efficiency it should take several weeks for a single asset. At the same time, we don\u2019t know how long it will take the community to evaluate the evaluations. So there\u2019s some complexity that needs to be thought about.    25:21: Will the different types of collateral assets be allocated by risk-weighted asset theory? And will each asset have a multiple tier structure for different CDP types?  If the questions is whether we are doing it like traditional asset types, then not exactly. However, there are some similarities. The model itself has some differences since crypto assets have different characteristics than other asset types.    Chris B Governance Portal Upgrade Recap 30:00  Governance Portal Upgrade Blog Post  The first big thing we\u2019ve done is moving all the polls into their own proposal pages. That way the front page can contain multiple Governance Polls comfortably. Votes happen inside of each proposal\u2019s page. We\u2019ve added a full vote breakdown in each of these proposal pages. The way polling is done now: It used to use DS-Chief, which would lock up MKR restrictively in an empty slate. That is no longer the case. When you vote now you simply emit an event to the Polling Emitter Contract. The wallet can only emit an event if it holds MKR or is linked to a wallet that holds MKR through the voting proxy contract. Polling stats now stay after the poll is finished. You have a full vote breakdown and history visible on each proposal page. Polling details are now verifiable in a decentralized fashion. All the content for given proposals is now hosted outside of Maker, on GitHub. Additionally, the Event Emitter Contract takes a hash of the URL and content of the poll each time a vote occurs. This allows anyone to verify the details of any given poll any time in the future. See example  This upgrade was for Governance Polling, the team is actively working to improve the Executive voting as well.  Questions for Chris   38:04: We\u2019ve been having a discussion about how to deal with MKR left in old proposals. Is that issue addressed in this upgrade?  This is not dealt with in the current upgrade. We are looking at this issue as part of an upgrade on Executive voting, post-MCD launch.    David Forum Activity Recap 42:00  Governance at a Glance Thread   Signalling Guidelines  In this thread LongforWisdom summarizes  the older Meta-Governance thread in a Guidelines format. Seeking consensus on a canonical set of guidelines around signaling on this forum. Are these good guidelines? What else should we include?    The Asset Priority Poll, August 12 at 4pm UTC  Seeking consensus on the form of the coming on-chain poll for prioritization of collateral assets. Which of these suggested options do we like, what pitfalls do we need to be aware of? This is simply establishing the order of work to be done leading up to MCD launch. No commitments. Option #2: Yes/No poll for each asset is winning. This allows voters to express their interest for each asset. The total MKR staked for NO would cancel out MKR staked for YES for each token. If a large MKR holder votes No to all of them we would order by least negative votes.    Twitter account @mkrgov to keep MKR holders updated and involved in regards to governance  There are resources from the Foundation available for anyone willing to build this for the community! Contact Rich if you are interested. Vishesh\u2019s team is also looking into this.    Vishesh Dai Analytics 45:16  Relevant links Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Dai Price: 46:12   Dai price has been stable at $1, with light trading low volumes over the last couple of weeks. 14MM in trading volume over the last 7 days. Most of that trading happened almost exactly at 1$, or very slightly below. Average 2MM volume per day. Eth price has been consistently low. What we\u2019ve probably encountered is some fatigue from leveraged positions. The amount of debt wiped over the last couple of weeks has ticked up, though the amount of debt that has been issued has been relatively steady. This means the supply has come down fairly significantly.  Dai Supply: 47:54   The supply drop to 77MM, down from 96MM, can be explained by both refinancing as well as a lowering of overall Dai demand. It\u2019s more than likely that that demand loss, given the way the collateralization has moved, is just a reflection of lower demand for leverage. Transaction volumes have been steady over the past month or so. It\u2019s important to consider what causes Dai demand, because we\u2019ve entered a bit of a period of stagnation.  Collateralization Ratio: 48:45   The amount of ETH locked has come down a bit, in lockstep with overall supply dropping. We are now holding steady at a ~360% overall Collateralization Ratio. Not a lot of movement in collateralization, generally. The downward movement of supply and overall demand seems like a reduction of leverage behavior.  Secondary Lending Platforms: 50:32   What we had seen in mid-July was the weights and the utilization shooting up significantly, partly as a function of refinancing ease through InstaDapp. Beforehand people were not taking as much advantage because of UX friction, knowledge, etc. The utilization has leveled out a bit, so the only explanation for the drop in utilization along with supply means there must have been some reduction in demand for leverage positions. When you see disproportionate changes between dYdC and Compound, it\u2019s important to understand dYdX\u2019s market fit. It is used for different reasons than compound generally. dYdX is a platform for users who are specifically looking for tools that provide them with leverage. Many of these users are looking for short-term plays and are willing to pay higher borrowing costs. Compound has been a de-facto cheaper version of Maker where people can source excess Dai for cheaper than MakerDAO.  Circulation & Age of Debt: 56:25   Since mid to late July unpaid fees have increased compared to paid fees. Though there seems to be a step function for paid fees, as ETH is more volatile we will see more churn/circulation in debt which results in more paid fees. Eth being stable has resulted in flat behavior.  Questions to Vishesh   57:53: Do you have a theory for why more people aren\u2019t refinancing from Maker to Compound, now that the rate for borrowing is significantly lower?  The market moves a bit slow, and I think it takes some time before people look at consistency in rates and decide to refinance. I think we will see more refinancing over the coming days if the rate stays lower for borrowing.

We need to use these calls to surface ideas that go to the forums for Governance. Keeping our life-cycle of finding signal here > bringing it to the forum > and refining signal to bring to the voting portal. Let\u2019s brainstorm and keep up the momentum.   We\u2019ll review the flop(debt) auction parameter discussion. The community needs to take action to protect users and shore up the system. We can alter these decisions in the future, but we need to take corrective action.   We\u2019ll also discuss SCD shutdown and circuit breakers. There has been a lot of armchair economics lately, but we\u2019re here in this group to stay ahead of the trends. Since our ecosystem is adversarial by nature, it designs protections, immunity, and check and balances in the absence of meta-rule books. One of these checks and balances are circuit breakers. We\u2019ll discuss how this affects the ecosystem writ large.   Give us feedback about the call.   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Governance Rich Cuellar Lopez Flop Auction Parameters Forum Post Overview 06:00   Forum Thread   Rich CL: Scheduled debt auctions are coming up. They may fail to attract bids, given the current starting parameters being very close to the market price. We want to mitigate the risk of no-bids due to a lower spot price than the MKR price that the auctions are currently configured to start with. Some options:    Let the auctions go on as is, no parameter change.     Delay the auctions for a couple of days, week, or indefinitely.     Change the lot size (dump parameter), the length of the auction tau, or the discount factor from one failed auction into another (pad or the padding).      Rich CL: On a high level, increasing the lot size will bring the implied MKR price down. Increasing the discount factor(pad) means the implied MKR price will drop faster on a failed auction. There are other options outlined in the forum post.   Aaron Bartsch: Spot prices are hovering at $200. We should keep it for $200, seems like market prices are keeping to the auction prices.   Dawson: Agree. dyDx trading at 200$ per MKR since there is a Dai premium.   Aaron: Dump price is \u2018guaranteeing\u2019 price.   David: I wouldn\u2019t say that guaranteeing is a strong word.   LFW: Might be correlated to following auction price, but may not be causal.   Cyrus: Not a 1 to 1 correlation.   Dawson: One risk I\u2019ve been thinking about is how buyers will be turning over the MKR tokens. It may be sold in the secondary markets, and there is about 200k worth of MKR sitting on books across exchanges. The secondary markets don\u2019t have the liquidity/demand to support massive MKR sales, meaning the price may falter in the auctions.   Cyrus: We may see bidders taking the long-term position on these markets because of the thin liquidity on secondary markets. It\u2019s going to be tough to arbitrage the auction against the secondaries. Because of the minimum bid price, you can\u2019t even discount the bid price against the market price. In some ways, this could be good for the community because if we see bids tomorrow, it will be from long-term investors. If we don\u2019t, we will see that keepers require arbitrage against market price and will have to wait for a few cycles of auction re-initializations.   Dawson: That\u2019s a good point; people may buy without arbitrating the auctions. The worst-case maybe that MKR tokens are bought upfront; as liquidity dries up everyone participating is out of funds (since they\u2019re buying for long term) or arbitragers aren\u2019t buying because they\u2019re waiting for a price drop, will see a delay, and then with a significant drop, they\u2019ll start arbing on the secondary markets at a lower price. Do we just want that to be more efficient? Would it be better with a price discovery that\u2019s quicker?   Rich CL: It seems to me that if you can avoid failed auctions and bad debt sitting on the queue for a while, then setting a lower implied price may be better for these auctions since it would attract more participants. If we change the parameters and the auctions stabilize at $200 per MKR, that\u2019s great, but we should try to fortify the health of auctions without relying on speculation.   LFW: Despite the big push to get lots of people involved in the auction for keepers, we may see people looking to buy MKR from secondary markets because they don\u2019t have the technical knowledge or capital to buy into these auctions. They might be waiting on lower prices in the secondaries. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see more liquidity as the auctions go on.   Rich CL: The Maker backstop syndicate will be there to make sure the auctions don\u2019t fail for too long.     17:26   David: Does the backstop syndicate have a technical solution for participating yet? I haven\u2019t been following along.   chat multiple people: contract is deployed and deployment link on etherscan   Rich B: They have a repo    Scott Bigelow(Epheph): People pool in before the first auction for the backstop syndicate. Contracts should deploy today, not sure where the front end is. To be fair with reward distribution, you will need to be part of it before the auction gets started. The hard part is marketing it out to everyone to get liquidity. It\u2019s kind of a race to get the liquidity in there.   Rich Brown: We\u2019ll schedule a presentation for the end of this call if you\u2019re willing since the auction is tomorrow.   Cyrus: As it currently stands, based on last night\u2019s forum poll, auction parameters will stay as-is. This isn\u2019t such a clear cut issue. If there are any changes to be made, they need to be addressed as soon as possible. It will take some time to deploy any changes, especially in the case of keeper parameters (in addition to technical risks).     Technical Development Adrian Le Bas Flop Auctions UI Presentation 22:32  1088\u00d7806 167 KB   The user will come in with a Wallet that has Dai.

Users will enable the debt auctions, and bid for the respective auction.   They can choose an instant bid or a custom bid. Custom allows you to change the MKR amount. While instant bid takes the most recent bid and adds the minimum bid increase amount as your bid.   Use the keepers channel to reach out with feedback.   Questions 28:12   David: Is there an expected domain that it will be hosted at?  Adrian: Likely auctions.makerdao.com but subject to change.    Rich: Is it going to be able to handle a significant number of auctions?   A: We expect them to be handled fine, with 100+ auctions happening at once. We\u2019re working to optimize the queries currently. We\u2019re confident about the flop auctions. At a later stage, we\u2019ll be working on flip auctions.   Rich: Can we get a glossary function for some of the parameters?   A: It\u2019s on the roadmap for tomorrow.   LFW: Can we do a tutorial run through before the auction starts?   A: Walkthrough will be during this call tomorrow. If we want to do it before the auctions start, happy to do that.   LFW: Since auctions don\u2019t end before or during the call, then we could do a tutorial on a live auction.     Risk Cyrus Circuit Breakers, USDC collateral, the potential Dai liquidity crunch 31:45  Yesterday we started talking about the circuit breaker and USDC as collateral. While we have these tools in our arsenal, we haven\u2019t discussed when or how to use them.   746\u00d7416 43.2 KB   Three major changes to Maker in the last week.   1225\u00d7588 130 KB   Today we\u2019ll be discussing the keeper liquidity issue.   1199\u00d7544 100 KB    The last step of converting ETH back into Dai involves sending it to the centralized exchange like Coinbase. It may be easier to assume that you can cycle through Uniswap, but this is not always feasible given network congestion. It may take a couple of hours for keepers to convert ETH into Dai, probably around 6 to 8 hours.   2/3 number is not ideal for Dai owners, but will be addressed with better and better Dai liquidity.    1281\u00d7569 125 KB   1308\u00d7635 170 KB   1331\u00d7605 151 KB   1323\u00d7702 187 KB    This liquidation freeze is structured so that it is not subject to the governance delay. The reason for 1-hour notice is because of the OSM delay. You have 1-hour advance notice that the liquidations at a lower price will be triggered.   Additionally, there is a price volatility risk in freezing liquidations. The alternative is a severe liquidity shortage, which almost certainly results in poorer prices received through the auctions.    1300\u00d7660 190 KB   1257\u00d7667 193 KB   1299\u00d7714 191 KB    Surgical oracle prices are a purely technical and theoretic solution since there would be enormous social layer implications.   Losses for Maker in another huge debt auction would be enormous.   ESM cost/benefit analysis is not well understood. We need to understand how and when to use this as an option. It isn\u2019t only in the event of technical issues, and I am not certain if it is a viable option in terms of such a liquidation event.   It would take 4 hours to pass a change for the USDC debt ceiling. The auction is 6 hours. The community would have to act incredibly quickly. Technically it is possible, but it has fairly high coordination costs.    1300\u00d7658 161 KB   1325\u00d7591 130 KB   1000% is an arbitrary number, of course. The high SF USDC Vault would only be used for keeper events in the case of a liquidity crunch. The USDC at lower SF would be used for day-to-day peg management. We need to align on a target use case for USDC.   1302\u00d7539 117 KB  Questions and Discussion  LFW: With OSM, we\u2019d have seven hours versus six.  55:13  LFW: I think it would make more sense to launch a second USDC Vault type rather than adjusting the original one. People who opened positions at 20% wouldn\u2019t appreciate a severe increase.  56:50   Rich CL: Regarding circuit breakers in the most recent liquidity crunch, keepers were ground to a halt with high gas fees. In that scenario, would they still be able to signal to prevent a new set of liquidations and be able to get the circuit breaker initiated?   Cyrus: If the 6-hour bid duration is insufficient, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to trigger the circuit breaker for the current set of auctions that have already begun. They could potentially freeze any further liquidations until the network issues are fully sorted out.   RichCL: I think the circuit breaker is a pretty strong protective measure. But I am wondering what is the signal to trigger the circuit breaker?   David Utrobin: One of the implicit signals is that auctions may start clearing at a higher and higher discount to the market price.   EphEph: The problem is, many liquidations are triggered simultaneously, and that signal may be too late.   David U: Projected liquidations could be another method.   Cyrus: One of the assumptions is that we have an estimate for the starting base of keeper liquidity. You can know in advance which amounts keepers can handle and which they cannot. The community can still trigger the circuit breaker in situations where the signal isn\u2019t sent from the keeper. I don\u2019t think auction keepers would ever complain about the circuit breaker being triggered as it gives them more time to source additional Dai. The risk is mainly to the protocol as it introduces volatility risk of the collateral being auctioned, potentially not being worth the trade-off to wait. Perhaps we need to come up with an estimate of keeper liquidity and governance can decide on the spot whether the keepers can handle the wave of liquidations.   Rich CL: Perhaps there is a way to source this signal from other measures, such as the price of collateral, even hours in advance.     1:02:05   Makerman: Three of these scenarios that Cyrus laid out don\u2019t have resolution marks. We need exit strategies for what we will do.   David U: Do you mean prepared executive votes and stuff like that for the scenarios Cyrus outlined?   MM: When do you do what? I see two options here. We don\u2019t want to ES this thing when everything is disjointed. So we need to stop the auctions, letting MKR holders ride collateral through a potentially ugly event. ES in that situation throws the loss on Dai holders, while Vault owners are generally protected since they can withdraw the net of their position after ES. I keep coming back to needing clarity on each of these scenarios about who gets hammered. We should know the implications for all the entire ecosystem participants: Vault owners, Dai holders, and MKR holders. We should have an understanding of what our actions mean for all parties involved.   MM: We should consider getting SCD out of here while the market still looks ok. People should be able to clear out their positions.   Rich: The point is totally valid. We need to have clarity on our contingency plans.     01:06:35   Cyrus: This link is a dashboard that demonstrates the amount of collateral to be liquidated at every price point. If all the community can see an estimate of the needed keeper dai liquidity, then they can know in advance at what price points they would need to trigger a circuit breaker, and at what price point we would need more severe measures. I think the community can come up with some general heuristics.   Vishesh: If you need 30 million Dai to cover short-term liquidations, USDC can be used to improve the liquidity in the case of a higher Dai price. You can essentially use a 1.25 multiplier on the amount of capital that you need for the liquidations in order to determine the amount of USDC that you would need. This you can then set to 1.26 or 1.27 to have a collateral buffer. Using the same site, in terms of USDC, you can see how much of it is collateralized.   As of yesterday, a huge chunk of the collateral (between 130-140%). When this thing is being heavily utilized, people will probably ride the line for the collateral cutoff for USDC. You can effectively call it 126% or 127% multiplier. Then you don\u2019t even need Dai; you just need dollars or USDC(to boost Dai liquidity.)     Aaron Bartch SCD Shutdown Discussion 1:12:43 Forum Thread Discussion 1:16:26   ScottB: It is worth noting that as of this morning, almost all liquidations occurred on SCD. ETH is likely to be under-collateralized.   Rich: I was unaware, thanks for sharing with everyone! It\u2019s important to clarify the risks from SCD on MCD. Aaron, do you have any thoughts on that?   Cyrus: My only opinion is that the community treats this with some level of urgency and determination because there is an odd situation where the PETH holders are at risk if ETH goes down and these underwater CDPs don\u2019t get bitten. In terms of the tax situation or date, I have no comments at the moment. The least desirable outcome would be the ES of SCD.   LFW: In the event that we see another major market movement downwards, we would have to ES SCD, which would be bad for PETH and Sai holders. Do we want to just call it now, and allow people to exit with a fair distribution of value between all system participants?   Lix: I was wondering if the shutdown could wait until after the flop auctions. My thinking is that the MKR price would probably take a big hit if we get none of the SFs back.   SB: If you look at the liquidations on SCD, the $70 ETH price point seems to be the major marker. If it falls below $69, there is like 2 million Sai left.   MakerMan: Let\u2019s waive the fees in the system, screw it. We got the system down to $15 million Dai, which is pretty great. The remaining consideration is the timeline of SCD and the PR that ES of SCD will cause. Given the risks, we should unload SCD sooner rather than later. The PR optics would be good if we forgive fees. We just need to give enough PR notice about this. I recommend a seven-day schedule to shut it down. I\u2019m also concerned about the UIs being available for SCD ES participants to be able to do what they need to do.     1:27:00   chat LFW: How does the migration contract affect MCD in the event of a SCD ES?   Cmooney: the function that I just linked is when the cage(ES) function is called.   Another bothersome function that is only available after ES is one that allows you to mint Sai against collateral at the fixed oracle price.   We must shut down the bridge before we execute ES on SCD.   Gonzalo: We would also want to remove the Sai we have in MCD as well. Since that collateral would need to be auctioned. We should immediately stop the bridge from Sai to Dai, but keep the bridge open to go from Dai to Sai. If we still have Sai funds in the migration contract, we would have to liquidate them.   Cmooney: Just thinking out loud, but would one method to do this be   use USDC to mint Dai = Sai in migration   convert Dai to Sai, emptying the migration contract   [relisten]     cmooney: Could be anyone, not just us. This is assuming there is some incentive. I haven\u2019t fully thought it through.   chat Kurt: after SCD shutdown, SAI essentially becomes wrapped Ether with extra steps.     Rich: The actionable step is that we all need to have the same mental model of what will mechanically happen during this process. We need to consider the business and risk perspectives. We need to think about timing. It sounds like we need a forum thread to be kicked off and audit the previous SCD Shutdown threads.   Scott Bigelow (Epheph) Backstop Syndicate 01:36:05  Super short, there is no working demo to walk through yet. The backend UI and contracts aren\u2019t quite linked up yet.   915\u00d7877 93 KB    The UI will look something like this. It will give users the options to deposit Dai, exchange Dai, and to withdraw at any point before the auction starts.   Once the first bid is placed, there can be no more deposits. Thus preventing late entrants from getting the MKR rewards.   The backstop syndicate version has an encoded price at 100 Dai per MKR, though other instances can be spun up to participate at a different price point.   The system mints tokens to those who deposit Dai, and those tokens can be used to redeem a proportional amount of Dai and MKR back from any won auctions.   There are some changes being made; we are working through the deployment process and making sure this will function in the real world.   Since its 100 Dai per MKR, it will give us some time to properly set up if the auctions get no bids. This project may be irrelevant if the auctions receive bids from the start.     Questions and Comments 01:38:57   Rich: How flexible is the price point?   Eph: Each price point is a parameter that can be changed in different instances. Though the official deployed contract would have a hardcoded price point. It\u2019s really just designed to be a backstop.   Eph: We may be launching with two versions; one at 100 and another at 150.   Rich: I have a huge personal appreciation for the effort put into this. I want to extend an offer. Let\u2019s talk offline; we have resources available to potentially help this code get audited.   Eph: Dharma said they would be potentially putting up 1 million, so the code should definitely go through some significant level of scrutiny. An audit would be great.     LFW: Personally, I would be very nervous using this without an audit.   Rich: Is there a projection for when its ready to be on mainnet and functional?  Eph: hopefully, by the end of the week. It will be a task of raising Dai from the community. Though this is only necessary if tomorrow\u2019s auctions don\u2019t receive bids.    MakerMan: If it\u2019s utilized, and its 50% used, do people get half the MKR they pledged for?  Eph: You can claim a proportional amount of Dai/MKR after the end of the auctions, based on initial Dai deposited.    Cyrus: Having something like this on standby for future flop auctions would be super useful. Tools and infrastructure like this will only make the ecosystem more efficient.

DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Q&A for Governance Facilitator Role   02:55: Concern #1: The timeline seems too short to get meaningful community engagement.  We\u2019ve been wrestling with this. The amount of time it takes to evaluate these things properly is one of the main first questions we need to decide on as a community. We made a guess and put a timeline of two weeks because we don\u2019t know how much time is needed. The expectation was that if there were low community interaction and debate, then we would move it to a forum poll and then into the Governance Polls. If we were to see a lot of community interaction and debate, we could easily delay things and tune it to the preferences of the community. Nothing is set in stone, and it\u2019s possible to push things up due to so many open questions. LongForWisdom: the proposal itself is great, I just have this feedback from a process standpoint.   These are broad strokes, and this is an iterative process. We\u2019ve identified three different schools of thought about how to move ahead with Governance:  Canonical source of truth model: suggesting we create a framework with sufficient resolution and represent the community as one unified guidebook of principles and processes. If the community says no, we revise and try to resubmit a better-suited framework as a whole. Manual model: Setting prudent rules for all the processes and defining a clear manual for how Governance should be run. Iterative model: We take an approach of making one decision at a time, and doing our best to imrove the idea by implementing it and revisiting it in the future to see if we can make it better.   We think Governance is an iterative process, and this is all just a way of saying we don\u2019t exactly know the best way to move forward, but we expect the community to guide us in the right direction. As the Foundation, we need to be mindful of the fact that we are not a small project. We shouldn\u2019t be having radical experiments. Governance should plan in baby steps that can be improved as we move forward in time. There are more concerns to cover, but in the interest of time, we will leave it here for now. We encourage you to join the discussion on the forums where we will be going back and forth on other concerns. We may continue some Q&A in the post-call discussion.  LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 13:45   Governance at a Glance Thread  Mandate: Risk Teams  Cyrus shares the Risk Team Mandate for consideration and ratification by the community. Are we happy with the role of risk teams? With the general process defined here?    [Results] Collateral Asset Priority Poll - August 19, 2019  Rich breaks down the results of the asset priority poll. Any surprise results that jump out? Strong satisfaction or dissatisfaction? Share it here.    Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators  This thread is still very active.    MakerDAO Goals: Short + Medium + Long term  A suggestion that we try to define short, medium, and long term goals for MakerDAO. Can we come together on goals like this? Who would spearhead this process?    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  We have a 66% consensus on this now. 15 people have taken part in that, but we need more to have a meaningful signal.    Risk Cyrus Risk Team Mandate Review & Discussion 17:46   Mandate: Risk Teams The history of this mandate: From the early days, there has always been this notion of having decentralized risk teams. When Steven came, he framed it as a decentralized risk function. In getting closer to MCD launch, there are specifics about how Risk Teams operate that need to be answered. As we started to explain and discuss many of these open questions online, we created this document to capture some of the answers that seem to make the most sense. There aren\u2019t just operational questions for candidate risk teams, but for MKR holders themselves as well. We realized that we need to get everyone on the same page for how Risk Teams function in our community to minimize any potential chaos and lack of clarity. It\u2019s difficult for a Risk Team to come along and engage in arbitrary negotiations with a DAO. To make things easier, this document is meant to benefit MKR holders and Risk Teams by defining some things clearly. Ratifying this mandate through an official governance poll will help with the process of ratifying Risk Teams. One concern we had with the purely decentralized version is the amount of overhead that would go into onboarding a risk team, risk models, parameters, etc. By creating this mandate, we are putting forth a first pass at how we might do a practical implementation of Risk Governance. This is a good introduction to people who are interested in becoming risk teams.  23:04: Summary of the mandate itself. In this mandate, we tried to strike a balance between specifics that we can define now and allowing for vagueness on issues that we will have more clarity on in the future. This document was designed to set a threshold for safety and responsibility for how risk teams might operate while leaving room for growth and iteration.  42:55: comments on how Risk Teams get compensated.  a fuller framework will be developed over the coming months.    Questions   38:32: How do we enforce that with actors that don\u2019t follow the rules?  That\u2019s part of the reason this mandate is being put up for a vote to be ratified. Actors who circumvent this proposal should not be legitimized. Presumably, this would be one of the roles of the Governance Facilitator. There will be a particular set of checks and balances in place to ensure quality and rigor. If a Risk Team is not living up to standards, there will be a way to out them.    44:09: How do we handle consensus around changes and deviations from the general model?  Risk Teams would need to resubmit an iterated model and explain why their thinking has been updated. If you want to make changes to the general model, it needs to go through a vote. We need to focus our disagreements on the methodologies of the Risk Models rather than the outputs themselves to avoid unneeded disputes.    47:03: Question on how responsibility works for Risk Teams & MKR holders.  Ultimately MKR holders vote in all these risk parameters. Risk teams can only output suggestions. From a community standpoint, it should be on us the manage and oversee these risk models and outputs. There should be some scrutiny at all times, which can be achieved in understanding that MKR holders have complete responsibility. Risk teams are contractors.    Vishesh Dai Analytics 53:22  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  ETH price has been down; It took a sharp jump down around the 15th of August. The total USD$ value of collateral has gone down. Though, in nominal terms, the actual amount of collateral has been relatively flat. Over the last 7 days, the trading volume has been relatively low, around 2MM per day. The price has been sitting slightly above a dollar for the previous 7days & 24hrs. The supply has been relatively steady around 76-78MM. The overall Collateraization Ratio has come down, which indicates a higher risk in the system since the amount of total debt stayed the same. The amount of leveraging behavior has been comparatively low lately. Price movements of ETH have not significantly impacted drawing and wiping activity. As has been previously discussed, the Stability Fee is a modifying variable that affects what happens with Dai supply through ETH\u2019s price action as an input.  I don\u2019t imagine that lowering the Stability Fee slightly would have a significant effect on the Dai price. Though there is a case to be made that given the reduced demand, we should lower the SF slightly.    Secondary Lending Platforms  The rates have been more or less steady. There is a 2-3 point spread between borrow and supply rates since the beginning of July. Borrow volume has picked up slightly but is overall remaining steady. Supply volume has continued to increase, although the increase has been slower on Compound rather than dYdX in the last week. The utilization rate on Compound has come down to around 75-78%, and for dYdX it was holding steady in the 70s and has been in a relatively stable state. This means that the buffer that exists on SLPs is still just sitting there.  Questions & Comments to Vishesh   01:05:46: We are very close to a lowering of the SF to 18.5%  Matthew Rabinowitz Discussion 01:06:56   What tools were used to allow Dai to float at $1 when it first launched in the immature market? The reason I ask is because we should consider the practical details on how a new Dai from MCD will behave during first launch, and whether we should be concerned considering the market has matured and it may take more in the beginning to bootstrap the peg.  Rich: we don\u2019t have an answer at the moment, we need to revisit this question next week.   When you go from system A to system B, the lack of immediate demand on system b might be burdened with downward pressure of supply. That is the crux of my concern.  01:13:02: Lasse - One mitigating factor is that the migration contract will also allow for the conversion of MCDDai to SCDDai. So if there is a significant price difference, there will be an incentive to arbitrage between the two Dais.  The migration contract creates one CDP where all SCDDai can be deposited and based on this in MCD, MCDDai can be issued from that. And vice-versa, if you want to move your MCDDai into SCDDai the contract would remove the SCDDai collateral and give it to the user. This is a proposal for the migration mechanism.    ",

Now that MCD is out in the wild, and the dust settled, we\u2019re reflecting on our protocols success and planning for the future. We\u2019ll be focusing some of the discussion on how we make sure there is a gradual and efficient decentralization of the protocol.  We mention \u2018gradual decentralization\u2019 often, and it\u2019s not a catchphrase. It\u2019s a goal. We need a robust governance ecosystem to make that happen. I feel privileged and encouraged watching our achievements over the past year. The Foundation agrees that Governance is a primary focus and one of the most important parts of the Maker Protocol\u2019s success. We need to establish better processes, get deeper insights, bring domain experts in who can speak about the challenges, their possible solutions, and more.    Speaking of bringing in domain experts, we\u2019re joined by Mariano Conti, who will talk about the MKR authority transfer. What affects circulating MKR and other mechanics.   Cyrus will be covering Debt Ceilings and Migration Risk.   Primoz will be presenting an analysis of Migration and SCD CDP owner behavior.   Vishesh will be covering the state of the pegs.   Derek Flossman will present about SCD SFs and Emergency Shutdown. Specifically, it\u2019s moving parts, how they all interact.   LongForWisdom will be discussing activity on the forums, and we\u2019ll have a moment to discuss Abartsch\u2019s threads about SCD shutdown.   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Tech Mariano Conti MKR Token Authority Transfer 03:45   On Dec 20th, the Maker Foundation put out a blog post detailing what will happen.   MKR token was still owned by the foundation multi-sig.   Foundation uses two protected methods, mint and burn. So far, the Foundation has never called those methods.   Maker Protocol requires being able to call these methods, particularly during Surplus and Debt auctions. In a Surplus Auction, the system needs to burn. In Debt Auction, the system needs to mint MKR.     All the MKR gathered from SFs in SCD were stuck in the burner contract. Over 10k MKR was sitting there, technically out of circulation. However, it did not reflect on the total ERC-20 supply. So what did we do? We created a special contract called MKR Authority, which enabled a couple of interesting things:   Anyone can call burn, which means one can burn their own MKR. Be careful!   If you approve a third-party contract on your MKR, that contract can burn as well.  Burn was called on the burner wallet, destroying 5 million dollars worth of MKR.    MKR governance now has control over the token. MKR holders can now choose to mint new MKR through an Executive Vote if they wanted to. We don\u2019t expect this to happen, but it\u2019s important to let MKR voters know that they have that power. The only time mint will be used is during Debt Auctions.     The next step is to remove the multi-sig completely since now there is joint ownership of the MKR token. When that happens, governance will be the sole owner of the token.   Questions and Discussion 08:23   Rich: Mariano, are there any timelines associated with the final handoffs.   Mariano: Mostly a matter of coordination. Don\u2019t want to rush into it in case of latent bugs. Governance now has the ability to mint \u2018infinite\u2019 Maker, so its a pretty powerful feature.   Rich: True, but its a powerful shift into what crypto governance is about. I\u2019m unaware of anyone else in the space who has done this. I\u2019m surprised more people didn\u2019t notice.   M: I guess more people noticed that the total supply went down after the burn. But the main thing is the hand-off of authority.   R: It\u2019ll be one of those things that will take a while for it to sink in. I\u2019m quite proud of us.     Mariano: One question I\u2019ve gotten is, why didn\u2019t we do this sooner?  For SCD, MKR is only used to pay SFs. It doesn\u2019t have the feature of participating in Debt Auctions. In SCD, to recapitalize an underwater CDP, the system would mint PETH. There was no need to call the mint function before on MKR. But now that the system may need it, it\u2019s important for it to be enabled.    LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 11:35   Governance at a Glance Thread   Mitote\u2019s thread about a treasury for Governance   Mitote presented the reasons why we should create a treasury and why we\u2019ll need one in the future.   Associated Signal Request Thread: Should Maker make a Treasury to manage revenue?     Derek, from the Maker Foundation, discussing the Global Settlement mechanics   The post covers the mechanics, and the tax parameter(as discussed in chats.)   Ties into Aaron\u2019s signal request threads, that are summarized here.   Derek dives into this thread in his presentation, summarized below.     Why SF = DSR? Request for discussion   Dai supply prediction poll  300m Dai is the leading vote.    DSR spread thread  This is moving on-chain on Monday\u2019s Governance Poll     Signal Request: How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes?   Summary of parameters for SCD shutdown   To start with, Aaron made a poll to ask, generally, whether shutdown needs a date, supply, or peg deviation. We narrowed these factors down a bit. We hit three polls for each option:   Peg deviation; the winning result was .05 away from the peg. Important to note: no timeline definition on this option.   A Timeline poll; winning option was six months.   Supply poll; winning option was $10 MM Sai.     PlanetX points out Governance overhead  One note is the increasing length of Governance calls. Regularly, these are 90 minutes though they used to be an hour.    Comments and Discussion 12:08  Rich: I encourage everyone to take a look at Mitote\u2019s Treasury thread. The post aligns with a coming shift in the governance paradigm. For the community to have autonomy, it needs a source of funds and the ability to use them for protocol expenses; forming processes and standards around fund allocation, expense tracking, auditing, accountability, and voting will be a necessary step. To enable that autonomy, the community needs to organize in a sophisticated manner around the topic.  21:40   Adam: \u201cWill any security measures be taken against Governance attacks that mint MKR?\u201d  Sam: GSM, referencing time delay on Governance actions, should protect against majority Governance attacks. It\u2019s still currently at Zero, so that\u2019s an excellent point to bring up: since it didn\u2019t pass, at what point do we recycle that vote?    22:41   Kenton: One idea is to break the Risk and Governance call into two calls. Risk earlier and Governance later in the week.   Rich: Interesting thought. It\u2019s come up before. Right now, this meeting is about 90 minutes. An hour of presentations and a 30 minute Q&A. If we split it into two, the call becomes two hour-long calls; the worry is that there will be twice as much with two different days. Also, if someone is interested in both Governance and Risk, now they\u2019ll need to devote twice as much time for the full picture.   David: I\u2019d also like to point out the operational overhead of producing summaries as quickly as possible.   Rich: Right, operational overhead is painful right now, especially as the Foundation maintains two tracks. Risk teams, developers, even an ecosystem, is trying to figure out who is using Sai and Dai. It\u2019s a significant amount of time and energy just keeping all the channels aligned. Reddit, Chat, Twitter, Forum, summaries, transcripts, YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.  That\u2019s just broadcasting. That doesn\u2019t include agendas, speakers; tons of work goes into just this 90-minute call. If we decide on two calls, we can assume we include twice as much effort; maybe there is an economy of scale here.     26:41   David: Bringing back Franks question and answer: What was the voter breakdown of the Sai SF poll  that just passed?   LongForWisdom: Interestingly, the 9% Sai value was set by one whale ~3 hours before the poll ended.   Rich: That doesn\u2019t surprise me. Here\u2019s the problem with human nature even, but specifically with our governance; people with less than 5,000 MKR look at the current set of voters that consist of two or three large voters and a ton of smaller voters and think it\u2019s not worth it for them to vote because they can\u2019t influence the system due to the size of the larger voters. However, by not voting, they are giving more influence to the large voters. It\u2019s a negative cycle of thinking, and it\u2019s human nature.   I don\u2019t know if MKR holders will be able to avoid this kind of thinking. Though I think they should because if people committed to voting with their smaller holdings, they could collectively hold influence that would keep the larger voters accountable.   This is something we need to figure out. We have things on the horizon like vote delegation, incentivization, campaigning, etc. We created a straightforward stakeholder voting system, and stakeholders aren\u2019t voting, so we need to solve that problem.

Trying to gauge: how arbitrary or accurate will the tax bill be at the end of the 4-day suboptimal repayment time?   Nik (nkunkel): You\u2019re trying to incentivize people to pay their SF\u2019s before the tax period is implemented. It\u2019s not about setting a perfect tax to the amount of SF\u2019s owed; the issue is communicating that if you don\u2019t pay your Stability Fees and close your position by this date, you will get screwed.   During that tax-period, it\u2019s sub-optimal for anyone to pay back their CDP\u2019s to close them since they\u2019ll have tax on top of Stability Fees owed. After implementing tax, it\u2019s finished. Whoever you incentivized to close their position did, and the person who decided is not going to. It makes more sense for them to go through Global Settlement.   It\u2019s 100% about being vocal about the tax versus SF difference.     R: We can\u2019t yet assume the tax rate. It could potentially be higher or lower than the SF\u2019s.   N: It has to be higher, or else there will be no incentive for anyone to close. It can\u2019t just be a little bit higher; it needs to be high enough so as to make clear that it isn\u2019t profitable to dodge your SF\u2019s.   Matthew Rabinowitz: There will certainly be a group, with Dai outstanding, that have the intention of waiting for Global Settlement to convert their CDP.   R: If the community doesn\u2019t want the expectation of a safety hatch for CDP owners to linger, we need to make clear the plan sooner rather than later.   Derek Flossman: I think the model in the diagram is correct, and that the discussion is moving toward that. We will have to agree on what some of those values are around the parameters to have the right incentives at play.   R: It\u2019s going to be murky. I\u2019m looking forward to deeper discussions.     42:09   LongForWisdom: I think the largest SF that hasn\u2019t been paid is #3088, ~800k in SFs. In order for the tax to be effective on them, it has to be high enough to exceed that 800k. And it needs to be a short enough time window, say 1-2 weeks. Doesn\u2019t this mean that tax will need to be insanely high?   Matthew: Why have a short tax window?   Nick: Because there is no incentive for anyone to pay during the tax window.   Matthew: Not necessarily. Let\u2019s examine the scenario of say six months of x%. If it\u2019s going to be worse tomorrow than today, and worse the day after, no one will want to be liquidated on top of being taxed.   Rich: Maybe having a timer is the key.   Matthew: Another option is to increase the tax week over week, ratcheting up 1% per week until Global Settlement, for example. No one wants to be liquidated, so at some point, you force everyone to get liquidated.   LFW: I think the problem is if they get liquidated, they only pay the tax and not the SF.   Nik: Correct, they only pay the tax.   Matthew: All the more reason to have a longer tax period.   LFW: As soon as the tax window starts, they\u2019ll have to pay the tax and the SF. If they wait for Global Settlement, they only have to pay the SF.   Chris: But they also pay the liquidation penalty of 13%.   LongForWisdom: Ahh, correct.   Nick: This is an edge case on top of an edge case. Which isn\u2019t common for everyone.   LongForWisdom: Oh wait, I meant Global Settlement, not liquidation, my apologies. When they go through Global Settlement, they don\u2019t pay the SF just the tax.   Rich: There are two conversations going on right now, one in the chat and one in the recorded call. Let\u2019s try and have these conversations recorded.  As this call is already packed, and this is an ongoing topic, we\u2019ll continue to revisit this conversation in the future.      Risk Cyrus Migration Risk Construct Review 46:33   For SCD: Sai supply is around 35 million, DC is 70 million. This leaves an enormous gap of unused Debt Ceiling. From a risk perspective, we don\u2019t want to have all that unused space. I would recommend that the community lower that to something more reasonable, in line with previous SCD DC reductions.  Sai DC reductions aren\u2019t designed to stifle SCD. They are there for safety. DC can always be increased again for whatever reason.    In regards to the MCD DCs, market activity led to a very strong increase in the Dai supply. Dai supply from ETH collateral is getting up there, 85/100 million.   Two separate considerations with ETH Debt Ceiling for Dai:   In the short-term, it\u2019s not wise to leave unused debt ceiling space for MCD. Due to the Oracle Security Module (i.e., 1-hour delay before price changes come into effect), there is an opportunity for Vault owners to mint unbacked Dai if there is too much space. This is obviously not good for the stability of the system, so the DC should be as small as possible.   In the future, we will have Instant-Access Modules(IAMs) for more fluid updates without having to go through the full governance process.   Even if it looks like we\u2019re going to hit the DC soon, its not a good idea to raise the Debt Ceiling too preemptively.     In the long-term, there is the consideration of the theoretical max. Happy to chat about it offline; we\u2019ll also be approaching those concepts in the coming weeks.       Governance should consider some housekeeping items:   Dust limit, which was set 20 at launch, could be lowered in the interest of better UX and onboarding for our users.  Some of the devs don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge issue to lower it. Perhaps someone could put up a Signal Request Thread in the forums about this.      Primoz 51:44  Primoz\u2019s Spreadsheet on SCD CDP\u2019s data  Analysis  871\u00d7642 172 KB   Total supply continues to grow; Dai is up 6.5 million in the last week. Sai supply keeping steady, even increased about 300,00 recently.     Market activity corresponds to bullish sentiment.   The total supply of Dai+Sai increased by about 12 million.   The main topic is the lessened interest in SCD users to migrate to MCD. The Sai in the migration contract isn\u2019t being drained at the same rate as in the past. It\u2019s been two days since more than two million Sai has been held in the migration contract, and none of the biggest borrowers have really touched it.  Currently, all but 2 of the remaining SCD CDP\u2019s could migrate easily by using the Sai in the migration contract.     778\u00d7656 121 KB    Remaining SCD borrowers demonstrate some kind of backstop in migration.   This table covers the actions of the top 100 CDPs (90% of Sai Debt) for the last two months.   There is still minting going on, with one user doing a majority of the minting.    912\u00d7514 137 KB    Of the top 100 remaining SCD CDP\u2019s.   20 CDP\u2019s minting Sai, close to 6 million in Sai, and roughly 8 million debt represented.   Represent 1/4 of the remaining debt.   Not likely to migrate anytime soon, Sai is likely being minted for a speculative reason or some other incentive.     27 CDP\u2019s working on actively repaying their debt.   1/5 of remaining debt.   Debt repayment was likely limited by Sai liquidity.   The last two days have demonstrated more Sai liquidity but not as much repayment. Will continue to monitor.     19 CDP\u2019s locked with additional ETH.   about 10% of debt or 3 million.  Unsure if they want to migrate or are just protecting from liquidation.      2 CDP\u2019s withdrawing ETH from collateral.   32 inactive CDP\u2019s - no interaction in the last two months.   Debt is about 12.7 million, or 41% of the total debt.   Most were active six months ago.   Likely were minting Sai because ETh price was surging, and they were leveraging.        775\u00d7139 58.1 KB     Insights:  Inactive CDP\u2019s and those still drawing Sai represent 20 million or 2/3rds of CDP debt.       Additional metrics, not sure if I have time to get into them.   I would like to get all the remaining CDPs for a more comprehensive sample.   Rich: This information will be crucial to determining our next actions, including the aforementioned tax.   We need to create a recourse for this that is updated every month or so and shared in the forums.      1230\u00d7652 527 KB   11% seems to be the largest Fees/Debt ratio.  Questions and Discussion 1:00:34   Cyrus: If we can get everyone other than the inactive CDPs to migrate, could we put the lower bound threshold for the shutdown at about 12 million in debt?   P: Yes.   C: Is it reasonable to expect those still minting Sai (the red slice) to migrate as well? Maybe not, right?   P: Probably not. I checked those CDP\u2019s and am not sure of their motivations. Might be speculating on Sai liquidity crunch to get premiums.   C: Inactive Debt + portion of new Sai being minted going to DSR should be the lower bound/target for global settlement, yes?   P: Yes. That\u2019s the 20 million or 2/3rd of CDP debt that I mentioned.

But with Mkrgov.science, we can look at the poll breakdown. LongForWisdom posted a link to the Sai Stability Fee Poll. Seeing it hit 9% for the Sai SF, maybe we can see that as a push for migration?   Rich: Is that an effective strategy? Let\u2019s say their motive was to push migration from SCD to MCD.   C: Previously, the approach was to keep the SF low to keep the liquidity wheels going for migration. Now though, if the migration is slowing, the remaining CDP owners aren\u2019t liquidity constrained, but they\u2019re opting out by choice than potentially this might be a reasonable strategy.   R: If we breakdown those cohorts, it seems like they\u2019re embedded. If one already owes a huge amount in Stability Fees, I\u2019m not sure this strategy matters to them. It seems like that they\u2019re waiting on a \u201chail mary\u201d solution for GS anyway.   C: Wouldn\u2019t an increased SF make the decision to stay through GS more difficult?   R: We can\u2019t guess at the motivations of people, especially since crypto tends to be more irrational than the traditional world.   David: In a Monetary Policy-based Executive Vote, what if one of the parameters gets controversially selected? Like the 9% that just got chosen. Is it a form of governance attack to vote in an undesirable setting to delay passing the rest of the parameters?   R: Goes back to our discussion around guessing intentions. We\u2019ll have to think about Governance attacks in the future.   D: Delays can be just a strategy, doesn\u2019t have to be explicitly phrased as an attack. Some cohort might be seeking to keep the rates from changing for an extra week or two.   R: Right, it goes back to our GSM discussion from last week. Whether there is an external group of stakeholders who determine \u201cright\u201d decisions. Making decisions based on the results of activities is akin to passing judgment. We\u2019ll have to discuss this in the future.     01:19:11   Rich: Cyrus, did you chat about dust?   C: I think we should put a thread up with smart contract developers\u2019 input. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a risk, but another statement on record would help. It\u2019s set to 20 right now, but ideally, it could be a fraction of a penny.   R: Without a minimum, won\u2019t we get an avalanche of legacy Coinbase Earn CDP\u2019s?   C: Perhaps a more reasonable number like 1 or 5.     1:20:44]   David: Adam is asking about GSM in the chat, \u201cwhy just not to have not expire-able pool.\u201d   Nik: I think what he means is that existing votes for GSM don\u2019t expire when the MKR moves to a new EV.   R: That\u2019s an interesting question, but it destroys the entire model of Continuous Approval Voting, which the EVs are operating on.   L: Is there a reason we can\u2019t just show the un-cast EVs in the portal? There is still a lump of MKR on the GSM vote.   D: We could show them, and there is room for redesign here. Including past spells would require input.   L: Those issues are still here; it\u2019s just harder to do them.   R: To reframe this, the analogy I keep using is that \u201cthe protocol is like a software package,\u201d and \u201cthe Executive Votes are a configuration snapshot\u201d that we apply to that software package. As the EVs get older, the possibility of them being able to be applied to the software becomes reduced. Obviously, you don\u2019t want a six-month-old Executive Vote from SCD getting lifted and applied in our current system, that would be a disaster. There are questions about visibility and what we abandoned along the way. Possibly part of MKR is in past executives that could migrate to the current one. The trade-off here on the portal is inconvenient visibility versus exposing where MKR is hanging out.     1:25:39   Kenton: Has there been public discussion about spell expiration?   Rich: Back before the forums, we discussed it, maybe we should resurface those discussions. First, we should frame the problem and then the solution to MKR sitting on old votes. Some of the options have been:   Return the MKR to your wallet if it hasn\u2019t moved in six months.   MKR is only active if it\u2019s on the current EV or the EV that is actively being voted on.   An \u201cMKR is now stale\u201d mechanism that would move MKR out of any EVs.     Kenton: I was asking about the ability to cast a spell. Is there an ability to set an expiration on the \u2018casting\u2019 ability after it gets the hat.  For example, the GSM spell can be cast if it\u2019s given the hat. But, if before it\u2019s submitted(entered into DS-chief), there is a hardcoded deadline to cast the spell built-in that could provide added security. That way if the spell expires, the new Executive Vote needs a new spell, resetting the expiration date    Derek: What happens to the MKR when the EV expires?   K: It moves to the governing spell.     1:28:51   Kenton: Tangentially related; If I wanted to make a proposal, what format could I use to push the ball forward? Forums? I\u2019m just curious about the template to use.   LFW: There isn\u2019t a formal template. We see a template evolving. My best suggestion is to look at what other people have done and DM me if you have any questions   Rich: There are two posts that I\u2019m aware of: a meta for signal threads post and an updated version of what those guidelines are. They should help with details about formatting, how the polls should look, how the framing of the question works, and what the next steps are. Ultimately: make a forum post, facilitate the discussion, set a timeline, put a poll on it. Once enough signaling and enough interest arrive, and consensus is reached, we can work together to put a proposal in the portal.   Kenton: This proposal guideline would also include how to include engineering support?   Rich: Nope, the existing proposals are either policy or using the existing mechanisms that are already in place. We haven\u2019t pursued dev or integrations yet. We might have a MIP\u2019s process for all those steps soon from Charles and Derek.   Charles: MIPs framework is in development. In short, it has different procedures for different proposals from the community. Including all the Governance process from forums to implementation. We\u2019re working on it and will share it soon.   K: Timeline for that is when?   C: Still cleaning it up, can\u2019t make a timeline yet.   K: Reaching out offline, would we be able to use a drafted template in the interim?   C: We have models; let\u2019s discuss the process as it gets finalized.   R: Using the MIPs process, as a foundation member, is a healthy process. We can dogfood this, which is excellent. We all can alter the shape of the ecosystem by following the process.

We have a wide range of presenters from a wide range of stakeholder groups. I\u2019ll keep speeches minimal since we have a few presentations. Mariano is here to chat about GSM, Derek, about a vote expiring proposal, Vishesh with the Dai market analysis, Cyrus about collateral risk, and then LongForWisdom with a recap of Forum activity.   Give us feedback about the call.   DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Technical Mariano Conti SCD and the GSM 1:43   The governance delay is in place. However, we only have that for MCD and not for SCD. While the migration contract is present, there is a possible attack vector(The attack being an SCD governance action allowing fraudulently generated Sai to be converted 1:1 for Dai.) To counter this, we discussed lowering the SCD Debt Ceiling and lowering the Sai migration contract Debt  Ceiling in MCD.   Right now, the biggest Sai CDP is about 8 million Sai. We may want to consider reducing the Sai migration contract\u2019s Debt Ceiling in MCD to 10 million and the SCD Debt Ceiling to 25 million.   For the case of SCD, the smart contracts team has already figured out how to use the GSM in SCD. We are ready to put this up for a vote. I would ask the community what the best course of action is. I will be creating a post in the forums detailing why this as needed. We all know why we need a delay in governance actions; this applies to SCD. Would a poll be necessary?   Discussion 3:43   Cyrus: There are distinctions to be made regarding what we are voting on moving forward. They are:    To reduce the DC in the migration contract to something super low, like 10 million Sai. This isn\u2019t related to the SCD GSM; this is just an excellent precautionary move.     A separate initiative to activate the GSM for SCD.    Mariano: Those are the two big ones. Lowering the regular Sai Debt Ceiling is already in the latest executive vote.   C: But they\u2019re not a package, correct?   M: No, they can be different things. Meaning, you can lower the Sai debt ceiling and then on the MCD side not accept more than, say, 10 million Sai as collateral in the migration contract.       5:44   Rich: Do we need to go through the same cycle of forum poll on Monday and doing the Executive Vote on Friday? That cycle raises a question regarding the governance ecosystem: Do we want to run the risk of having it fail in the EV? Do we occasionally have decisions important enough not to put them into the forum?   Mariano: GSM was voted in on the same day. People may pay more attention to this if it is bundled in with other essential documents.   Rich: Are we even a position to subvert a process if we believe it is a higher risk?   LFW: We use forum polls to figure out which is the favored solution given multiple options. In the absence of alternatives, I believe it can go to an on-chain GP and then to an on-chain EV.   R: We don\u2019t make decisions in these calls, we just spark debates. Mariano will be putting a thread in the forum to explain this situation and add a poll Monday. Is there a precedent for skipping the Monday poll considering that we have already done this thing before? Can we just go straight into an EV?   LFW: Did we have a GSM GP for MCD? I believe we may have.   Cyrus: The recent one didn\u2019t, and went straight to EV. The first one did have a GP first.   LFW: Ideally, this should go to a forum post then to an on-chain GP.       10:16   Aaron Bartsch: For the proposals that I have done: I\u2019ve had to make a signal request, then an on-chain poll, and then an executive if they all pass through. If we want to make the same rules for foundation members, it should be constant for everyone. We don\u2019t have a precedent for this, though.   R: I agree with you, but I think it\u2019s a matter of cadence. A potential threat may require faster responses. Can you speak to the essential threat to the system, Mariano?   Mariano: I don\u2019t want to say that it is an emergency, but the same worries surrounding the MCD GSM apply here. The migration contract is still a significant attack vector on MCD. I think the forum polls are more for sentiment, and I think we can agree that the sentiment is in agreement regarding the GSM-based on the recent executive vote. My recommendation is to move straight to an on-chain poll on Friday.   LFW: Clarifying, the risks for the SCD is transferred to the risk to the MCD?   M: Yes, there is still a chance for an attack. There is no governance delay for SCD. Whereas a few whales with MCD are still limited in their voting consequences due to GSM, whales in SCD can get together and make substantial changes to SCD.   Chris S: So the risk is slightly different for SCD in the ability to mint Sai and also steal collateral. One attack vector in MCD was to put in a fake collateral type and then trigger an emergency shutdown. This would not occur in SCD, so there is a slightly different risk profile there.   M: Yeah, it is not 100% the same thing in both systems. However, I would still argue that an attack on MCD is a real risk due to the migration contract.     14:32   Rich: Will continue this discussion in the forums.   LFW: People need to understand the risks. What is the worst-case scenario?   Cyrus: I think the question is: Is the SCD collateral at risk as well?   M: Let\u2019s say a couple of whales get together, with 100,000 MKR, they can set the price of ETH in SCD at 0 and liquidate every single vault. They can set the price to infinite and then mint infinite Sai and convert it for Dai through the migration contract.   Gonzalo:  Basically, you can set the oracle price to infinite, mint a considerable amount of Sai up until the DC and actually change the DC, and effectively claim all of the collateral in the system. Meaning you can steal almost 100% of ETH in Sai and then use that Sai to generate Dai. That is quite a decent risk.   Dawson: Wouldn\u2019t you reach the DC on Sai?   Mariano: You can change the DC to infinite and mint infinite Sai in the same transaction.   Dawson: If there is a malicious attack, is the best reaction to shut the system down, or can the migration be paused?   Mariano: There are different ways. Once a malicious spell reaches the top spot in governance, queued up to be executed in 24 hours, you can start a new vote to remove the old spell before 24 hours. You can also shut down the system. There are many things that you can do, but they require a GSM delay.   M: I\u2019ll make a forum thread detailing everything that can potentially happen, and we can vote regarding it.     Derek Flossman Vote Expiry 19:13  Spell Expiration Proposal1434\u00d7714 144 KB   Spell Expiration Technical Implementation1476\u00d7783 161 KB  Vote Expiry Discussion 22:12   Rich: This feels like an excellent opportunity for a forum post to share the details.   BrianM: Kenton and I drew up a MIP proposal for this. However, since the MIP process isn\u2019t available yet and because of timing issues, it could be an issue if our proposal would pass out-of-sync with our current polling cadence.  These lines of code are in the template for weekly spells that should improve turnaround time. If it\u2019s controversial, we\u2019ll pull it. In the meantime, this will go into a verified code spell, and Chris Mooney will add some resources on how to parse this out when reviewing a spell. It should disarm all our Executive Proposals after a month.    Rich: For the longest time, I was explaining that you can\u2019t go back in time. Framing a mental model of the application and weekly spells, analogous to a protocol and it\u2019s config files. If old proposals are passed, there is a risk they could break the system, correct? Or at least a situation where the monetary policy doesn\u2019t make sense at all.   BMM: Theoretically, if some of the underlying contracts got an upgrade and didn\u2019t rely on the same API, it could revert. What\u2019s a more realistic scenario is a DSR that is inappropriate for the current ecosystem.   R: There is significant utility here and secondary issues, too, like MKR attached to old votes. Also, UI issues as well; if they drop-off in the portal in a week anyway, I guess we wouldn\u2019t need to display the expiry date after that.   Derek Flossman: This is only concerning spells created by the Foundation. That doesn\u2019t include proposals from the community that might not have a built-in expiration date like ours.   R: If the community submits a proposal, can they opt into making it expire?   Kurt: It\u2019s up to the proposer of the spell, you can add an expiration in your spell. If we want this as a requirement for all spells, we have to update the voting system itself.     chat Kurt: It should be noted that it\u2019s still possible for malicious actors to create and propose non-expiring proposals. Ensuring that all spells expire requires a Chief upgrade. But it\u2019s good practice to at least make our non-malicious spells have an expiration date, as it makes it easier to reason about the system and limits the opportunity for accidents.   Risk Vishesh Relevant links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs State of the Pegs 27:04  1055\u00d7382 69.6 KB   Sai trading volumes over the last 24 hours are small, at 127,000 Sai. Sai trades have seen more unpredictability. There is also a lot of slippage on Uniswap in both directions.   1050\u00d7478 132 KB    Dai trading volumes have been pretty significant in the past week, approximately 80 million in volume.   dYdX has seen the most significant trading volumes for Dai (blue dots). Oasis is second. Kyber has been relatively active in the last few weeks. Uniswap maintains a presence, as does Coinbase.    1061\u00d7471 104 KB    Dai trading is more or less on the peg. Dai would usually fluctuate a bit above and below peg, but in the past month, it has been on or slightly above the peg due to ETH price fluctuations. I say slightly because Dai has done a great job in holding close to peg. The only exceptions were two big trades that upended the balance in the last month, due to Kyber/Uniswap messiness.   Concerning monetary policy, Dai has been where it needs to be on an average basis. Sometimes it may trade a bit above or below, but on average, it has been relatively consistent. In terms of adjustments in SF, we\u2019ll discuss more next week regarding how changes in monetary policy (including ETH, SF fees, and DSR) impact the peg. The point I want to drive home is that the system is regulating itself, and I don\u2019t think that you can point at changes in the SF or the DSR and assume that they were the exact levers affecting the Dai peg performance.    971\u00d7509 102 KB   Total Dai and Sai supply has been kind of flat since last week. Not much impact in terms of Dai being minted or Sai being migrated. Prior to this time range, ETH went up, but now we\u2019re in a more \u201cwait and see\u201d holding pattern. Those major swings in ETH price are likely going to determine a lot of what happens with migration and Dai price as people decide whether to level up further or whether to liquidate their positions.  Analysis Questions and Discussion 33:53   Rich: I like the dashboard. Will we have access to that?  Vishesh: Thanks, it just launched and is live on the Dai Descipher website now.    Governance LongForWisdom Forum Recap 34:30   Need More Explanation on Vote Proposals   In which @Tarpmaster requests that more information be made available on the voting portal to help combat voter apathy.   We could work on our visibility of Governance summaries; they work so hard preparing them.     Should MKR governance get involved with Ethereum hard forks?  In which @cyrus asks to what extent we should get involved in hard forks in general, and ProgPOW in particular.    Seeking signal   Signal Request: Reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll   @hexonaut starts a signal thread regarding the voting cadence of the DSR spread vote. Most people seem to be in favor of some increase so far.   Governance Poll passed, we will be voting on the spread every 2-weeks now.     Signal Request: Add Ranked Choice Voting as an Option for Governance Polls   @hexonaut proposes adding the option for ranked-choice voting to the on-chain governance polling system, a proper discussion so far. Poll closed.   Moving to an on-chain vote soon.     Questions and Discussion 35:49   Cyrus: The discussion about hard forks is ongoing. We\u2019ll need some preparations.  R: Great point, we\u2019re battling with urgency/apathy, and a fork is a good jumping-off point. When a problematic issue pops up, battling the status quo is essential. How to deal with a fork is an enormous question. Let\u2019s keep that thread going.    38:18 In response to Signal Request: Add Ranked Choice Voting as an Option for Governance Polls   Rich: \u201cRanked-choice\u201d is the first proposal that requires developer input. Figuring out if this is community or developer-led is worth examining. Check out the thread for discussion on that.   Derek: The Dev Team came together to discuss the implementation model. We had some discussions about the implementation model. It\u2019s doable, but hard to predict a timeline on how long it\u2019s going to take. Other priorities in the pipeline. I\u2019ll try to get back to everyone on those details. Process wise: do we need to update the community once we have a scope?   LFW: That would be good to see on the forum.   R: Technical aspects are important, but it\u2019s also a decision making change; that\u2019s huge to acknowledge.   CMooney: When you write it up, I would suggest using that general model you proposed. The difference is light and not heavy-handed. I don\u2019t see faults, and we may uncover more as we implement.     Risk Cyrus Younessi Collateral Onboarding 44:53  Collateral Risk Model1062\u00d7560 34.9 KB   Agenda1064\u00d7604 34.1 KB   Collateral Risk will become an integral part of the governance/risk process, especially after we start adding new collateral types. How it fits into the broader questions will be seen as we go, but I think we will have to touch upon the process at a weekly level. Subsequently, this will be the agenda for the next few weeks. Keep in mind that there are differences in how risk analysis is approached from risk analyst to risk analyst, so point III will be highlighting our approach.

An extreme example of this is the OSM delay attack, where a Vault owner would draw the max Dai they can generate since they will be liquidated anyway. Therefore, the risk to MKR holders isn\u2019t purely a function of the collateral price.   Given that a Vault is liquidated at a 150% threshold, what would cause us to experience a sub 100% liquidation?   How do we think about a risk that has literally never happened?

Collateral Onboarding Questions and Comments 1:09:52   chat William Remor: Based on the oracle presentation from last week on the state of Oracles v1, isn\u2019t there even a slight possibility that a very sharp blitz drop in ETH leads into undercollateralized liquidation?   C: Even without the oracle delay, you could still have a very sharp drop in ETH price. The oracle delay just makes that drop easier to exploit. We attempt to quantify these things in the risk model.   D: Plus, there is a risk that people don\u2019t participate in auctions if the downturn is too sharp.   C: Right, auction efficiency, or slippage is something we deal with. That is the theme of the red band previously discussed. There are two main reasons why we may end up below 100%: The severity of the drop, also known as jump risk, and people not bidding on collateral, or what we call auction slippage.     1:13:05 (Question on liquidation ratios in chat)  The liquidation ratio is known as an in-between parameter, which means it is not a final output. For a given collateralization ratio, you would be able to change the distribution of losses. The higher the collateral required upfront, the lower the expected losses, and the lower the value-at-risk threshold. If you require higher collateral upfront, then you can set lower SFs. You\u2019ll also require less buy-in from the surplus buffer and MKR dilution. You can set the liquidation ratio to shrink or expand the loss distribution, effectively balancing the SF and tail risk.  1:14:14   Vishesh: What are the most important factors to determine loss versus gain?  C: Gains come from liquidation penalties and SF\u2019s. Losses come from undercollateralized vaults. The DSR is supposed to be completely offset by the DSR portion of the SF. When risk losses, we\u2019re referring to DSR spreads and the risk premium above the DSR cost.    1:16:16   chat Richard Lopez: is a potential lack of participation in auctions the only source of slippage?   Cyrus: The auctions are where the slippage occurs. The reasons why we experience slippage might be numerous. Primarily they are a function of exchange liquidity. We assume keepers use exchanges as a liquidity source to perform the arbitrage. We use exchange liquidity as a proxy for what Maker might be able to absorb in the collateral auctions. There are other considerations, too, such as Dai slippage.   In an edge case, if the liquidations are strong enough, there can be a Dai shortage, which can lead to further slippage as well.     1:18:02   LFW: Is there a rate limit for how many auctions can trigger at once?   C: It depends on how quickly you want to offload the collateral. If we had an enormous amount of collateral liquidated, you wouldn\u2019t want to auction it off too soon as it would depress exchange liquidity. You would want to create an algorithm that balances the cost of selling fast versus waiting and spreading it out over time. Allowing for better liquidity balanced around market volatility.   LFW: Is it the lot size that limits the auction?   Mariano: For ETH, the lot size is 50 ETH. If there were 85 ETH, a keeper would create two auctions. The first would create an opportunity for 50 ETH, and the second would have a value of 35 ETH.   LFW: They can happen simultaneously?   M: Correct.   L: If we liquidate something ridiculous like 1K ETH, then many lots would auction and all for 50 ETH.   M: Exactly.     End Discussion 1:21:01: End of call Discussion   Cyrus: Next week, we\u2019ll explore risk parameters in detail. Specifically, the components of the SF, Liquidation Ratio, the DC, and then more intricacies of the model. At a lower level, thinking about Jump-risks, simulations, etc.   Rich: Thanks, Cyrus, that will be fun to watch. Everyone keep eyes out for Mariano and Derek\u2019s posts in the forums. One last reminder for us on tying threads and discussions week over week. Last week we spoke about oracles and this week, not at all. Before that SCD shutdown and fees, then we stopped talking about it. Reflect on keeping the threads alive and see everyone next week!   Credits   Igor Teslya produced this summary.

I\u2019m LongForWisdom, one of the MakerDAO Governance Facilitators, and I\u2019m joined by a bunch of Maker people.  Governance LongForWisdom Governance At A Glance 01:17 Governance at a Glance Forum Thread COMP Liquidity Mining Impact   Most of the discussion this week has been around COMP, so I\u2019ll leave that for Cyrus. I will briefly go through the other things.   Multiple threads about COMP farming:   Upcoming COMP farming change could impact the Dai peg, by Cyrus.   Poll: options to handle COMP farming, by Planet_X, where he explores the possibilities for how Maker might want to react to it.     Seeking Signal: wBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium   [Signal Request] Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium  I\u2019m reading one single thread currently, about adjusting the wBTC debt ceiling and the risk premium, which passed 19,000 to zero. A fairly favorable pass, so I guess that will be in the Executive on Friday(passed.)    Vault Compensation Plan  I would just like to highlight as well that the Vault Compensation Plan thread is in the forum because we could still use some feedback. So if anyone has some time, please add comments.  Community Greenlight Polls  The second set of community greenlight polls are still on-chain! Please vote to signal your support or opposition for the domain teams spending time on adding: ENJ, MATIC, WKT, LEND, PAXG, LINK, and KNC to the Maker Protocol.  MIPs LongForWisdom MIPs Weekly Update 02:51  This week we\u2019re in-between two governance cycles, so there is not much of MIP specific content today.  MIP submissions   MIP 16 Introduction, The Weekly Governance Cycle, by Charles St. Louis.   MIP16 works towards codifying the weekly Governance cycle. It\u2019s now in the RFC phase and will probably be submitted to the July governance cycle during the formal submission period, which starts next Monday, until next Wednesday.   Next week, we\u2019ll be able to tell everyone what\u2019s happening in July, hopefully.     Oracles Niklas Kunkel Oracles Proposals 03:55 Overview of Last Month   We had a bunch of oracle proposals go through point votes last month. There were a bunch of whitelisting proposals:   DeFi Saver ETHUSD | BATUSD | WBTCUSD   MCDex ETHUSD     And a bunch of light feed proposals:   Infura   Gitcoin   Kyber   EtherScan     Next Step: Executive Proposal  I\u2019ve been assisting those teams with setting up their new feeds. Looks like everyone is ready to go, so we will be batching those into tomorrow\u2019s executive proposal for final ratification from the community(passed.)  Proposal from Argent  We also got a proposal from Argent submitted today to become a light feed. That\u2019s going to be something we process in this month of July.  Discussion 1 Marginal Returns 05:00   Rich: I have a question for you, Nik. Is there an upper bound on light and dark feeds where it becomes less useful?  Nik: It\u2019s implied. I think I spoke about this on a previous call. One of my little submissions is to reach an equilibrium in this balance of power between dark feeds (anonymous identity) with the light feeds (public identity). I\u2019ve heard some people say, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we go super hard on the light feed ones?\u201d. I think it\u2019s a double-edged sword. You don\u2019t want the community to one day turn against Maker and have the power to completely screw over just based on sentiment. In that sense, the dark feeds can be really useful. The idea is that if there is a sort of an equilibrium between the two, and you set the quorum higher, overall, it makes the oracles more secure. That is why we\u2019ve been adding so many light feeds lately. I think we will continue to add light feeds at an accelerated pace, until we reach that equilibrium. You are absolutely right that there are diminishing returns. Each of these feeds are paid 1,000 Dai a month, currently at least. We could always change that down the road. But it\u2019s a trade-off between adding cost to the system and the extra security of one more feed. The returns do become marginal at some point.    Risk Cyrus Younessi COMP Liquidity Mining Impacts 07:42  I\u2019m going to start with how I perceive COMP farming and how it has evolved over the last few weeks. If anybody wants to jump in and correct me, more than happy to have that.  Farming COMP mechanics   Compound launched their governance token roughly three weeks ago, and they had a very novel distribution mechanism where the token was allocated to users of their protocol. Specifically, it was weighted towards users who were paying a higher percentage of interest on their borrows and earning a higher percentage rate on their assets supplied. As a result, in order to earn the highest amount of COMP, you would want to essentially pay as much interest as you can, which sounds backward until you realize that the amount of COMP earned more than compensates for the amount of interest paid. In addition, you could loop through, or recycle, through these assets by continuously borrowing and resupplying the same asset, with the limit being their collateral factor for that asset.   So opportunists went in search of the asset on Compound that would pay the highest rate of interest. These rates are determined by each asset\u2019s individual interest rate curve.  For example, if the USDC interest rate curve caps out at 15%, but the BAT interest rate curve caps out at 35%, then you would want to borrow as much BAT as possible instead of USDC.    The BAT Market  There\u2019s fairly little price-risk involved because you\u2019re borrowing and resupplying the same asset, more or less, but this does open up users to a bit of liquidity risk, so we did see some distortion on the BAT market over the weekend. The BAT market blew up as a result of these incentives. We saw, I think, as high as 350 million BAT supplied versus 320 million BAT borrowed. Of course, the largest portion of this was recycled BAT. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to quantify the total amount of leverage embedded in the system.  Compound\u2019s Governance Proposal   There was was a fair amount of concern on the implications of this large BAT borrow market were, especially with the liquidity risk that I was mentioning before. So their governance community made a proposal to alter the allocation weighting scheme for COMP farming. So the new proposal, which was ratified two days ago, is scheduled to go live on-chain later tonight works as follow:  Instead of paying the largest amount of interest, an ideal farmer would want to borrow the highest amount of dollars possible, denominated in dollars.    Impact of Compound\u2019s Governance Proposal   This changes the game theory a bit because now you no longer want to pay the highest amount of interest, but the lowest, so your COMP rewards are diluted the least possible. So you would go and search which assets pay the least interest at the highest utilization rate, and that turns out to be Dai and USDC and potentially ETH as well, depending on the utilization rate.   At this stage, it becomes a little bit confusing trying to figure out which asset is the ideal. There are a lot of nuances, especially when it comes to evaluating the utilization rate. Also, if you\u2019re recycling farming assets in an asset where there is an enormous amount of excess supply, then potentially, it will dilute your COMP yields. So there\u2019s this little debate whether Dai, ETH, or USDC will dominate.   Mitigation Schemes  I think this is a discussion worth having and definitely worth understanding. But the more important thing is that given that there is at least some non-negligible chance that Dai is the ideal asset, this community should start working on mitigation schemes; what we want to do to prepare for market impacts. Over the past few days, there\u2019s been a number of proposals on the forums, so that should be interesting to carry on and explore.  How Comp May Cause Dai Demand  From the governance perspective, here is how I think about the whole situation. So imagine if some third party service was offering a very high DSR, then you could see a potentially huge influx of demand for Dai. And at the same time, the same third party is providing a source of very negative stability fees, which makes borrowing very attractive there. We could potentially see a large refinancing activity from the Maker platform to Compound. If we see both large influx of demand to get this external DSR and refinancing from Maker to Compound requires sourcing Dai on the secondary market as well, so that\u2019s where the primary demand concerns come in.  Potential Questions for Governance   How would governance respond to such a rate-driven environment?   Very simply, if demand goes up, then we want to increase supply. Most of the solutions over the past few days in the forums are variations of:   How do we increase Dai supply dramatically, maybe drastically, in a short time?   What\u2019s the safest and most sensible way to do that?   What concerns do we have on increasing the amount of collateral in the system?     USDC-based solutions   For example, from a price standpoint, the easiest way to increase Dai is USDC. Seeing last night\u2019s large mint, and potentially more to come if we increase the debt ceiling, there\u2019s an opportunity for the community to turn this into a very positive outcome if the right SF and the right DC are found. There\u2019s definitely an opportunity to keep the peg in line, and expand Dai supply, even if it would be mostly USDC-backed. I think that\u2019s been the forefront of the discussion. It\u2019s some change to the USDC parameters in addition to raising the debt ceiling and the stability fee.   A really common suggestion has been to decrease the liquidation ratio, so smaller market makers would leverage up to even more Dai, putting further downward pressure on the peg.  There\u2019s this question of what happens if farmers mint Dai out of USDC from Maker and stuff it into Compound instead of selling it off? That\u2019s what we saw last night: 20 million Dai generated, and I think all went into Compound. It wasn\u2019t necessarily used to push the peg down. This is where governance needs to normalize significantly larger amounts of collateral and Dai supply in the system if they go down that route.    Centralization Risks  If you\u2019re worried about centralization risks with USDC, a reasonable assumption is that beyond some small threshold of 10-20 million, it\u2019s my hypothesis that it\u2019s probably too much centralization risk for Maker to handle at this time, then there\u2019s no difference between 100 million and one billion. Just as a thought experiment: if the amount of Dai that maker would need to keep the peg in line and everything in check was a Billion Dai backed by USDC, Would the community be for that or against that? Especially if there was a stability fee put in there for good measure. I think that\u2019s a very important question for Governance to consider.  ETH-based solutions  Other supply focused actions are a second ETH collateral type, ETH-B, with a higher SF. Certainly, there will be a lot of ETH-denominated market makers to get into the farming activity, and that could be another source of supply generation and potential SF generation.  Outside of the Box Ideas  We\u2019ve also seen outside of the box ideas. I think MakerMan suggested some sort of reserve or open market operation that would definitely be a huge departure from what Maker has been doing until now. There have been quite a few different and diverse proposals out there, and unfortunately, time is of the essence. That proposal goes live tonight. I\u2019m not expecting anything to happen right now, but based on the activity that we saw with BAT a few weeks ago, over the next days, the situation will be much more clear.  Discussion 2 Are interest rates the cause? 14:30   Befitsandpaper: Is Dai right now better collateral for putting on Compound because of the USDC-A interest rate on Maker is lower than on Compound?  Cyrus: Not necessarily. One of the ways to disincentivize Dai is to increase Maker as a primary source of Dai. If the USDC rate was to go up, then we wouldn\u2019t have seen that large mint last night. Basically, for that person, it was cheaper to borrow Dai from Maker rather than Compound. However, that is not really at the core of why Dai is a popular farming asset.    USDC-A Stability Fee 22:40   Lev Livnev: It\u2019s very hard to predict what would happen over the next few days. But there are also some shorter-term things that are more clear. Yesterday, someone took out 16 million Dai against 19 million USDC, maxing out the USDC-A debt ceiling. This has two important implications:   The USDC-A is now exhausted, which is not good already. That collateral type is there to relieve Dai supply, and now that\u2019s gone. So should we try to address that? The obvious thing would be to increase the USDC-A stability fee to a point where that sort of activity wasn\u2019t attractive. The advantage of tackling that problem is that we can also look at the economics of that trade to see what makes it attractive and what level of stability fee would make it unattractive.   The second thing is that we could look at this as an example of what people are doing with Dai in Compound. But I thought it\u2019s worth starting a discussion with the USDC-A because it\u2019s at hand now.     USDC versus Dai in COMP farming   Cyrus Younessi: Can you briefly walk us through the mechanics of why you think that an increase in the stability fee of USDC-A is helpful? Because I think I could easily argue that it\u2019s hurtful at the same time.   Lev Livnev: Sure. I\u2019m speculating about the intentions of this trader, but we would have to ask ourselves why someone would put up USDC into a vault, and take out a bunch of Dai to put it into Compound. I don\u2019t think the answer is straightforward because you can\u2019t rule out reasons such as being worried that in the future, that debt ceiling will be exhausted, so they wanted to take it while they had the chance. There\u2019s this dynamic every time we get close to the debt ceiling. It could have been that. And of course, parking it into Compound is not an unreasonable thing to do, once you got this position. And the interest is very low, so the cost of doing this is pretty low. That is the most naive option that has nothing to do with COMP farming. This is quite unlikely because this user is a huge COMP farmer, and this Dai went straight into Compound, and they have this huge BAT recycling going on, which is actually the main source of income for this COMP farm. The second option is that, for some reason, there is superior economics to putting USDC into Maker and then putting Dai into Compound instead of the more direct route of just putting USDC straight into Compound and then do this BAT recycling. My guess is that currently, these considerations aren\u2019t dominated by the actual interest rate, the stated interest rate on Compound for Dai versus USDC, even if indeed the supply rate for Dai is a little bit higher than the one for USDC right now. I think the reason probably is the ratio of the total amount of USDC supply to the total amount of Dai supply on Compound. There\u2019s way more USDC supply, which is not surprising because it\u2019s easier to get and dump into Compound. On the COMP yield side of things, you\u2019re making much more as a Dai supplier than as a USDC supplier for the same amount. I think the data actually dominates the actual headline interest rate. The practical next step is to decide, \u201cis there a sensible level of SF that would make that trade no longer attractive and make the USDC go to Compound directly?\u201d That would have the advantage of taking all this Dai against USDC and freeing up some debt ceiling, that could be used in the future for potential demand shocks.   Cyrus: To sum up; The stability fee should be high enough where it\u2019s still profitable for people who want to arbitrage the peg but not profitable for people who want to do other things with that and waste our DC space.   Lev: That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about. I haven\u2019t checked the numbers on this, but if it turns out that a 10% SF for USDC-A makes this trade no longer preferable to go into Compound, then I would think that it would be worthwhile because the primary function of USDC is to meet demand. It\u2019s probably going to be less effective when Dai is at 1.01, but it will definitely still be effective when Dai is at 1.05 or something. I think that would be a comfortable middle ground where we would get USDC-A back as a tool.     New COMP distributions 28:50   Cyrus Younessi: I think that\u2019s going to be hard to forecast because the distribution is going to change dramatically starting tomorrow. Right now, most everything is in BAT, and the annual yield is around 70%, depending on the COMP price. But with the new distribution, if it splits two or three ways, who knows how much dilution there is within a particular asset then. I don\u2019t think we would know what kind of stability fee we would need to incentivize things one way or another.  Lev Livnev: I agree. Just to clarify, this trade that we were discussing now, it makes sense given the current pre-patch COMP distribution. As soon as the new distribution goes live, I\u2019m certain these users are going to start moving things around. This huge recycled BAT farm is going to become suboptimal, so they\u2019re going to actually switch to another asset. Whether they keep Dai as a collateral base is also unclear. There are multiple phenomena here that we\u2019re discussing.    Liquidation Ratio Versus Debt Ceiling for Creating Dai Supply 30:20   Cryptowanderer: I\u2019m not sure why lowering the liquidation ratio, which prior to this call seems to be the most popular option to do first, would help. If we haven\u2019t activated liquidations on USDC, and people can, in theory, go below 120% without being liquidated, what effect does lowering that ratio actually have on the amount of Dai that people can get?   Cyrus Younessi: My preference is definitely increasing the Debt Ceiling first. Especially because we know that at the current liquidation ratio, people are willing to take out Dai, as we saw last night. The point of lowering the liquidation ratio is just to accelerate Dai generation. As an extreme example, if the liquidation ratio goes from 120% to 101%, a market maker with 1 Million USDC on hand can generate 100 Million Dai of sell pressure, which is enormous. Of course, the trick is that they take that and try to arbitrage the peg instead of continuing to COMP farm with it. The simple answer is that it gets more Dai out there quicker with less collateral.   Lev Livnev: The debt ceiling is important first, and then we can think about the liquidation ratio. If the debt ceiling is maxed out, it doesn\u2019t matter what the liquidation ratio is. I think that in the grand scheme of things, the debt ceiling is what will determine supply rather than liquidation ratio.     ",

                    "content": " Are Polls Going Out Today 32:42   Chris_p: So are polls going out today? Is that what\u2019s going to happen?   Cyrus: Does the Maker community want to wait and see what happens? 24 hours? A day? Two days? One could argue that doing anything preemptively could be smart and ahead of the game or could be rash. It\u2019s an open question. Additionally, over the next few days, depending on how things turn out, it might be worth it to consider skipping governance polls if we need to, basically ad-hoc, or pseudo-emergency executive votes, especially given the poll turnaround time, and the GSM.   Chris_p: And with the holidays coming up too, lots of people will not be at their computers.   Cyrus Younessi: Coordination is definitely going to be a huge challenge over the next four or five days.      Next Steps  Lev Livnev: I would say that the most important thing would be to discuss what actual steps should be taken. I expect that a lot of assets in Compound will get shuffled around after the patch, which makes some of the possible calculations incorrect.   Stability Fee 34:40   Unknownname: If the SF for Dai is increased, but the demand for Dai for people to put into Compound stays the same, basically it transfers the pressure from people who are minting Dai to people buying Dai in the open market and probably pushes up the Dai price maybe significantly if people cannot make more Dai and relieve that pressure.  Cyrus: that\u2019s a good point. When you increase SF, that\u2019s typically what\u2019s used to push the Dai price back up. What we want to focus on is do whatever we can to increase supply, so definitely a good point.     Emergency Procedure 35:49   LongForWisdom: We have had emergency polls and votes before, so that\u2019s fine. In order to be comfortable doing that outside of the weekly cycle, as a Governance Facilitator, I would want either a clear forum poll asking, \u201cdoes the community think that we should take emergency action to fix this, outside of the regular cycle?\u201d Ideally, with a clear idea of what we want to do as an emergency action. Either that or, if Cyrus, as the risk domain team, thinks that we should take emergency action. Then it would make sense to do that. If we think we should act now, we could potentially do that. Alternatively, we can wait and put some polls up on Monday. Or wait, and if things get worse in the next few days, then we can do emergency actions then.   Chris_p: So does anyone know when the new patch is going to be applied? Is it tonight?   Cyrus Younessi: I believe so.   LongForWisdom: I think it\u2019s 2h15 from now. I could have the timezone wrong.   Chris_p: are people going to be paying attention on July 4th? Could we have another governance meeting potentially if things look bad? We should have somewhat of a plan to at least work over the weekend where the market could be moving really fast, and a lot of people might be away?   LongForWisdom: We can definitely do emergency governance meetings; we have had those in the past. Either Cyrus says that we need to do something as an emergency or the community votes, and there\u2019s a consensus to do something immediately.   Cyrus Younessi: For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ll be monitoring this.   LongForWisdom: Likewise.      USDC Stability Fee Signal Request 38:58   Andy Tudhope: Since the USDC debt ceiling is maxed out and in line with Lev\u2019s points, it might be potentially a good idea to get ahead of that. Cyrus, while I agree with you in principle, if we decide that the centralization risk is sitting between 30 to 50 million, and there\u2019s, in principle, no difference between 100 million and 1 billion debt ceiling, I think that in practice there is a difference, and it has to do with the fact that governance is largely about optics. The community is doing everything it can to defend the peg. A preemptive small raise on the USDC-A debt ceiling might not be a bad thing to poll in the forums now after the call, just to prove that this is something that we\u2019re carefully watching and considering for the wider community, people outside this call.   Cyrus: That\u2019s a very valid point. I would suggest after the call we put out a signal request. At this point, I\u2019m not even clear on what sort of options we want to put on the table. I would love to get some clarity on that, either on this call or afterward on the forums, and we can start working on a governance poll.   LFW: It would be good to have a better idea of what our options are in various situations, which might be good to try to figure out in advance.   Chris_p: Immediately, we all agree that there\u2019s an issue with USDC-A vaults. Maybe we just try to kick a poll with some parameters around, raising the debt ceiling, increasing the stability fees, and taking it from there. That\u2019s the type of action that we\u2019re very comfortable doing. We have a lot of history raising stability fees, and lowering and raising debt ceilings. It seems very natural; I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.     Cyrus: anyone else? Lev?  Lev: I would probably lean against raising DC without raising the SF because that would be potentially eaten by the same trader since we didn\u2019t figure out at what stability fee it actually breaks even. On the other hand, if we are increasing the stability fee, it could be appropriate to increase the debt ceiling. But just feeding this trade, assuming that this behavior isn\u2019t irrational, doesn\u2019t help.     Stability Fee Raise Tradeoff 42:58   Cyrus Younessi: Don\u2019t we risk raising the SF high enough so that it\u2019s no longer profitable to do the intended function, which is arbing the peg down? Don\u2019t you almost need to keep it low enough until all the excess demand from Compound is diluted away, and then they start arbing the peg?  Lev: I agree we\u2019re trading off, that setting it too high would be counterproductive. But you have to keep in mind that most of the debt ceiling is currently being used on this COMP trade. This means that by clearing that up, you could potentially get more room than from scaring the so-called legitimate part of that Dai generated from USDC. Secondly, I think it\u2019s acceptable to raise the DC if we come to the conclusion that a good number would be somewhere in the 3% - 13% range. You could still imagine people using that for peg arbitrage at Dai price of 1.01 and higher. I think that heuristically that seems reasonable. And basically, we\u2019re in a much worse situation if we have no USDC rope at all. Imagine if another exogenous situation were to happen right now, like ETH getting bearish. We have no rope at all in the USDC-A debt ceiling. It\u2019s not a good situation.     Signal Request Threads 44:55   Cyrus: What about a signal request thread for the debt ceiling and a signal request for the stability fee? Maybe we can put those out today, and we put out a governance poll maybe tomorrow so that people have a chance to see what happens during the course of today and take it from there?   LongForWisdwom: If you want to make sure that both pass or none, you would want to make a combined poll.   Cyrus: Makes sense.     [Signal Request] ETH-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments    Analysis  Vishesh  Relevant Links   MCD System Stats   DAI 24hr VWAP Graphs   Vault Data by Type    State of the Peg 49:49  1101\u00d7493 134 KB    Dai peg has come up in the last 48 hours. COMP activity and ETH prices looking good. The combination of both things creates a liquidity crunch on Dai. Prior to the shift in secondary-lending-interest-rate-models for Dai, there was a fair amount of buffer in the amount of available supply for borrowing. From that perspective, the impact on the liquidity crunch was mitigated. But I do think it will continue to have a potential price impact.   It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see Dai prices at $1.01 or $1.02. There is often an impact on price from secondary markets since, very often, it\u2019s a circular relationship. In this particular case, there is a rapid use case for Dai on secondary lending markets, a fact that Cyrus touched on. The impact COMP farming has on a particular underlying asset is elevating supply rate and depressing borrow rate; because both sides are compensated by the underlying yield token (which in this case is COMP.)   We\u2019ve seen this in a different context. When you have a low borrow rate and a high supply rate, it incentivizes rapid refinancing and secondary market re-wrapping and basically pursuing a large degree of leverage very quickly. In the past, we have seen that the yield for those rates doesn\u2019t necessarily last very long.   That\u2019s the scenario you want to try to consider and manage against. For the peg, that price could potentially continue to go up. That\u2019s something to be wary of.    1079\u00d7573 164 KB    Total Dai at $146 Million.   Dai from ETH at $114 Million.

Basically, in the last couple of weeks, the remaining amount of BAT borrowed has shrunk, probably as a result of yield farming on Maker assets.   1332\u00d7648 56.5 KB   Zooming in a little on just the last three months; Once there was a more attractive yield for BAT, it was refinanced away. The amount of Dai minted from BAT went down.   1327\u00d7653 60.6 KB   Looking at USDC, which has been sporadic since May. And now, in the last 24 hours, it maxes out utilization very quickly. This isn\u2019t a surprise.   1300\u00d7640 168 KB    Just looking at Compound markets, BAT became the asset for yield farming. With better opportunities, the supply in Maker shrank. The amount of Dai minted from ETH has slowed, and the collateral amounts are smaller.   On USDC, we saw a large amount supplied and a great amount borrowed. Pretty comparable numbers, in nominal value, to Compound.   More on USDC; We saw a large amount supplied and borrowed on Compound, and correspondingly, a large amount of Dai minted from USDC on Maker. We can expect this pattern to continue, given the attractiveness of the rates on Maker. There is a lot of risk math. Given a low collateral requirement and that it\u2019s relatively safe and stable trade, that makes it a potentially very attractive option. That\u2019s an important conversation for what kind of debt ceiling you want to manage on USDC.     A decent amount of Dai has been both supplied and borrowed on Compound too. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on it. We\u2019re talking about behavior, peg, supply, demand, etc. What is the underlying risk that\u2019s being created from this behavior? You have 61 million Dai out of 140 million as supply on Compound. That\u2019s a large chunk. And the larger that chunk, the larger part of the conversation of what is the total risk of the system, for Maker. That share could potentially grow larger, so it\u2019s undeniably an important part of the conversation.    1591\u00d7550 143 KB   For ETH, we didn\u2019t see a large movement in the amount of Dai minting, but there has been a movement in the amount of collateral. Since it\u2019s attractive to supply ETH to Compound, that changes the mental calculus for certain users around how much ETH to leave sitting on Maker. Though they aren\u2019t making large changes on the amount of Dai that they have minted from that ETH, I think there have been some shifts in individual users in the amount of ETH sitting as excess collateral. We\u2019ve seen the 200-250% and 250-300% collateralization buckets grow. 300-350% has shrunk as well as 500+%. I think this has gone from being a trimodal graph to being a bimodal or primarily dominated by this 200-350% collateral range. I think it\u2019s very clear why.   1572\u00d7426 222 KB   If we look at some of the largest USDC positions on Maker, the biggest one is at roughly 16 million at around 120% collateralization ratio. This has been the conversation with USDC since it was added, there was never a discussion around price volatility risk. But there are risks when the collateral type becomes more and more prominent month by month. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s a non-negligible share of the total amount of Dai that exists. What are the risks you assume as it grows?   1082\u00d7599 187 KB   In the last seven days, BAT was predominant in the loans originated on Compound.   1245\u00d7690 152 KB   In the last 24 hours, there\u2019s a creeping share of that Dai and USDC interest. WBTC is a different conversation.   Discussion 3 54:28   Cyrus Younessi: I wanted to highlight that it is definitely not a foregone conclusion that Dai will be the highest utilized asset for COMP farming. We want to focus on the oversupply of ETH and USDC. So right now, ETH is 242 million versus three million. And USDC is 227 million versus 34 million. So the gross borrow for ETH is up 500%, and USDC is up 21%. If those numbers continue to increase, all that ETH supply that\u2019s sitting there starts to become borrowed by its owners, reducing the spread. That would be beneficial for us. It\u2019s also the rational course of events over the long run. This goes back to Lev\u2019s forum post from yesterday. If those large ETH suppliers don\u2019t borrow their own ETH, the impact might come back to Dai.  Vishesh: Two important stats there. You can see the excess supply for ETH. It\u2019s huge. The attractiveness of the rates is the name of the game. Wherever is the most attractive yield is where the capital moves. In this case, how the attractiveness of the yield is determined, I think it depends on the share that the borrowing markets have on the market and the share of the total interest in Compound. There could be a whole conversation around the attractiveness of the different assets on Compound. If those rates aren\u2019t as attractive as borrowing your own ETH on Compound, you could see the scenario where that interest shifts to a different asset. That was exemplified with BAT as the attractiveness shifts, so does the interest. So it could potentially be a moving target.     Ending Discussion  LongForWisdom  Discussion 4  We are passed the hour now, so the Q&A session is officially on if anyone has questions about anything.   Dai Interest Model on Compound 01:04:50   Akash: It seems from the comments that Dai is right now the most attractive because of the differences between the borrow rate and the deposit rate. There is currently a Dai interest model vote going on on Compound that is pretty contentious. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen not 100% go one way. Does anybody have any opinions on: first, the vote going on on Compound and how it would affect Dai? Second, if the interest rate difference on Compound was larger than USDC, between the borrow rate and the deposit rate, wouldn\u2019t that solve our problem of why Dai is going to Compound? Because of the recycling effect? I\u2019m hoping everyone understands my questions.  Lev: I am not actually convinced that post-patch the spreads between the displayed supply and borrow interest rates are actually the dominant factor, and it is because post-patch the interest rate per se doesn\u2019t go into the COMP yield calculation anymore as it does now. So the interest rate is an additional cost you have to pay on your COMP farm, but the COMP yields themselves are huge. Unless you are really paying a lot of interest, and generally, when you are recycling, you\u2019re making back most of what you\u2019re paying on the borrow on your supply. So keep in mind that, just for numbers that I\u2019ve looked at, you end up getting something like 80% APY COMP yield, obviously at current prices, etc., while paying 5% APY on the actual spread between the supply and borrow. Essentially, the supply and borrow ends up being less important, and what dominates the COMP yield is the relative share of lending and borrowing on that market, which can be a much bigger difference between different assets. I just wanted to point that out for you to keep in mind.     Are Large Yield Farmers selling their COMP 01:07:21   Akash: Right. Another question that might be unrelated; I don\u2019t know if anybody has done any research. All of the guys that are recycling on Compound, are they completing the arbitrage by selling the COMP token, or is this a way for them to accumulate COMP tokens? Because that would help some of the understanding of what is driving this. Does anybody know that?  Cyrus: I don\u2019t think that a lot of people are speculating too much on the price of COMP, to be honest. I think that it just adds an additional variable to the overall business model. Sure some are because they have opinions, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a core part of the entire operation. Of course, the entire concept of COMP farming has blown up because of the sustained high prices, that\u2019s definitely true.     The Source of the COMP Subsidy 01:08:35   Chris_p: When do you think the music stops? You know, it\u2019s going to happen eventually. The only question that I have is, \u201cwhere exactly does this subsidy come from?\u201d  Cyrus Younessi: It comes from retail speculators putting up bids on the secondary exchanges. The amount of collateral that is flowing to Compound is a result of the dollar amount of COMP you can get out of it based on.     The COMP Arbitrage 01:09:23   Akash: I think we have discussed the arbitrage very cleanly, right? You deposit funds on Compound to earn COMP tokens to sell COMP tokens to complete the arbitrage.   Cyrus: It\u2019s an arbitrage, but it\u2019s like a rebate. A centralized liquidity rebate and the rebates are very high.   Akash: Yes, I guess a true arbitrage would be if you could borrow USD in the real world for let\u2019s say 10%, and then essentially, you would get a 20% return in the DeFi world.      Nuclear Option QE for Dai 01:10:15   Lev: I just thought I\u2019d mention an idea for a nuclear option if the situation gets really out of control. In principle, MakerDAO can do a type of open market operation where it mints a large amount of Dai, puts it into Compound as supply, and then takes the cDAI essentially as collateral onto its balance sheet. By doing this, you could essentially flood Compound with an arbitrarily large amount of Dai; it could be like one trillion Dai or something. [laughs] Essentially, have all this cDAI on your balance sheet instead. That would essentially wash out everyone\u2019s COMP yield.  So firstly, it would make the supply side of the Dai market so big that no one is going to be making any money on the supply side. At that point, I think that could really tip the scales in favor of literally any other asset; and it will also mean that Maker would be collecting the COMP for the Dai part so there would be no way of making money involving Dai on Compound anymore. It would all just become collected by MakerDAO. It\u2019s just worth thinking about that possibility, and it\u2019s relatively safe because we are taking the cDAI onto our balance sheet as collateral, so we are collateralized by the other Compound assets.     Lowering the Collateralization Ratio 01:11:35   Cyrus Younessi: You can achieve something similar without the social implications. I mean, if the liquidation ratio goes low enough to 101%. I think that at 100X leverage, that would be incentivizing the market makers to do pretty much the same thing, right?  Lev: Yes. I just like the component where we can take the cDAI on our balance sheet to avoid taking additional risk. Obviously, if you flood the Dai supply too much and it actually leaves Compound, then you have too much supply. But I think the difference between what I suggested and what you suggested is that we can actually take the cDAI as collateral, like 1 to 1 basically. It is literally QE for Dai, right?     Interest Rate of QE 01:12:31   Akash: And if you were to do is, what is the interest rate for the cDAI collateral?   Lev: This isn\u2019t a CDP at all; this is an open market operation, where MakerDAO itself mints unbacked Dai, well it\u2019s backed by the cDAI that we get in return. So MakerDAO itself acts as an agent to put a large amount of Dai into Compound. And the reason it\u2019s not completely whack, it\u2019s because we are actually getting cDAI in return. Just like when you do QE, it\u2019s not completely whack because you are getting bonds return. So we can unwind this later by giving the cDAI back to Compound in exchange for Dai.   LongForWisdom: If we did that we would get a huge amount of COMP, because the open borrow on the Dai market would be like a trillion, right? So we essentially take all the COMP then, which is not a great look.   Lev: Yes, that is why I said, \u201cnuclear option.\u201d This sort of situation looks adversarial or drastic. I don\u2019t want this idea myself, but I\u2019m just saying that it is an escape. And before anyone makes fun of this, it doesn\u2019t need to be a trillion Dai, that would just throw things off too much, but it could be a sizeable amount that we thought would have the necessary effect.      Ideal Proposal for COMP Governance 01:14:05   Akash: Let me ask the reverse question: What would you propose in an ideal world, what does COMP Governance do to mitigate risk for the MakerDAO system?   Lev: Post-patch, I think we need to figure out whether or not it is actually the case that Dai is getting sucked up, and if so, what parameter makes that trade attractive, what is so special about Dai. Because some have suggested that it\u2019s the interest rate curve, which I think is valid because Dai is this freak asset on Compound that has this absurdly low interest-rate curve. All the other assets have this kind of linear curve, and the Dai one is essentially flat and also pegged to the ETH stability fee. But I think that might not be the main reason initially; it might actually have a little bit more to do with the relative size of the supply.   Akash: I think they might have done that to help the MakerDAO system when the peg was off, and you could easily borrow Dai from there at lower rates to hopefully maintain the peg, right?   Lev Livnev: I didn\u2019t mean to speculate about the intentions there. I\u2019m just saying that it has had the effect that it can be abnormally cheap to borrow Dai on Compound. Just to give a succinct answer to your question, I think that if it\u2019s the rates, then we need to change the curve. If it\u2019s a question of relative supply because the COMP yield dominates, then COMP supply scheme, I would recommend be patched again in order to not put this absurd pressure on the smallest market, which is what it\u2019s doing.   Akash: I feel that we are going to figure out a lot more tomorrow.      Interest Rate Curve Calculation 01:16:54   Sam MacPherson: Is the interest rate curve for Dai on Compound set via the ETH-A stability fee?   Lev: It\u2019s a somewhat complicated formula. You can see what it is at any point in time, on the front end, you can see this curve and just roll on it. But if you want to actually work out how it depends on the stability fee, you need to look at the code. I looked at it this morning. I couldn\u2019t describe it in one sentence what it is in some sense pegged to the stability fee.   Sam MacPherson: So if we increase the ETH-A stability fee, we can increase the interest rate on Compound?   Lev Livnev: Exactly, we would be increasing both the supply and the borrow rates, though.      ETH-B Option 01:17:35   Sam MacPherson: Right, I don\u2019t know how feasible this is but we could set up an ETH-B, move people over to that one, and the time frame is probably not reasonable but just as another sort of crazy option, and then up the ETH-A stability fee to whatever we want to, to make it unattractive.  Lev Livnev: Yes, I\u2019ve also thought about that. I think that is also one of these backdoor hacks that might work, especially in the extreme. It\u2019s not even inherently obvious that if you just manage to jack up Compound supply borrow versus using the stability fee as a backdoor, then you would actually make the situation better because you might also just incentivize a bunch of supply into it; Because imagine that we have this ETH-B which is very cheap and we trick Compound into making their supply and borrow rate for Dai really high then we might just end up incentivizing more of it getting sucked in. I mean, they also have the right to upgrade their interest rate model again so that they don\u2019t have this backdoor as well. So it\u2019s a little bit adversarial obviously.     Signal Request for USDC Debt Ceiling and Conditional Stability Fee 01:19:15   Cyrus: Just to confirm, after the call today, I\u2019m going to put a signal request for the USDC debt ceiling and a conditional stability fee.   LongForWisdom: Yes, that was my understanding.    WBTC Stability Fee 01:19:42   Akash: When does the WBTC debt ceiling increase? When does it go into effect?   Cyrus: I guess, along with the executive vote.   LongForWisdom: The GSM delay is currently set to 12 hours. The executive goes out on Friday at the usual time, some time passes until it gets enough MKR, and then it\u2019s 12 hours until GSM.

Today there will be our usual agenda and, in addition, a presentation on the proposed solution to the GSM issue. It\u2019s an ingenuitive solution that is built on a cryptographic primitive, and it\u2019s named the dark fix. Wil Barnes from the technical team at the Maker Foundation will present for us and will post on the forums in a few days. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 1:54  Governance at a Glance Thread  Who is voting 15k MKR to increase the DSR spread to 2%  In which @psychonaut wonders why anyone would vote for a 2% DSR spread. Discussions ensue.    Continuous Polling  A newcomer to the forum, @andytudhope, summarizes and presents the idea of Continuous polling, originally pioneered by @Adam_Skrodzki. If at any point, the active polls are different from the polls in the protocol, we would create an executive proposal to reconcile that difference.    Suggested Improvements for State of the Peg graphs  In which I attempt to get some feedback for the \u2018Most Wanted Improvements\u2019 for the State of the Peg section of the Governance & Risk call.    Signaling   Signal Request: What should the next ETH debt ceiling be?  In which @bit asks how much we should increase the MCD Debt Ceiling, or whether we should leave this parameter in the hands of the Interim Risk Team.    Signal Request: Should we reduce the minimum bid increase required for Surplus Auctions (FLAPs)?   @Aaron_Bartsch asks if we should consider reducing the minimum bid for MKR surplus auctions. Hasn\u2019t reached a consensus answer yet, please consider compromise options!   Should we have another executive vote regarding the Governance Security Module? Signal Request: Reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll Signal Request: How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes?  Questions and Discussion 4:08  Rich: Did the person voting on the DSR spread reconsider?  LFW: It looks like they changed their vote because they realized they didn\u2019t have enough to win. I posted some vote history in the thread. 2% started winning, then a lot of MKR dropped to 0% and .5%, then the move to .5% started winning. Rich: There was a signal for technical fixes vs. monetary policy, right? Can we speak about the implications of bundling of technical and fiscal changes? L: It passed with 100% agreement for \u201cno bundling.\u201d It means that some entity needs to define an \u2018emergency.\u2019 At the moment, I phrased this as the Foundation technical team is the authority to speak to an emergency. The interim risk team serves for monetary policy recommendations. R: This creates a new dynamic that didn\u2019t exist before. Bundling increases the risk of a weak Executive Vote when the protocol needs technical fixes. For fixes to happen, groups of actors need to agree on suspending the monetary policy vote or not.    8:43  Rich: We keep butting up against continuous approval and first past the post voting. I think the topic is worth evaluating, and Andy Tudhope is a deep thinker in the space, it\u2019s important to take his thread seriously.  L: This change would make GPs more like the EVs.    11:31  Rich: The risk team was empowered with extra migration responsibilities. But, at some point, we have to figure out when SCD migration is over or ending. Cyrus, do we have a critical metric we\u2019re waiting on?  Cyrus: To answer the DC question of what the next ETH DC should be first, the heuristic we\u2019re using is these $25 million increases to satiate the community appetite, until we do Governance V2 where we take a more quantitative approach to how some of these parameters might be derived.   R: Additionally, due to the OSM risk, even if the max theoretical DC was very high, we should never set the DC that high immediately. Using incremental increases for safety\u2019s sake is critical. As long as we\u2019re not exceeding safe thresholds, there aren\u2019t significant issues. R: Migration is ongoing. Discussions continue about $20 Million outstanding Sai, and it feels like we\u2019re still in that phase.  LFW: It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re practically finished with Sai migration or potentially in shutdown phase, whereas MCD demand is mostly new interest and not migration. David: Primoz mentioned about 300 wallets are the owners of 90% of Sai debt in last week\u2019s call. C: We haven\u2019t discussed an exit strategy out of the migration phase. If we want to declare ourselves \u201cout of migration,\u201d that\u2019s possible. The current plan of small DC decreases when there is too much room in the SCD supply. We do need a long term plan at some point.    16:26  Aaron: Most of these auctions only have one bidder; a good resource is daiauctions.com. 3% is the min bid increment. If you bid just under 3% of the current MKR price, you can be the only bidder since no one will overbid MKR price against profits. My thought was we could lower the min bid against the MKR burn spread.  Mariano: If you lower the bid, the fastest bid will be close to 1%. In this case, it pays to be the quickest. I\u2019ve seen bids hit with $7 in gas (101 GWEI per bid) A: Keepers are capturing 3% on 10k Dai, I made the thread to see if we could capture more value for Maker holders. Ed Noepel: I worry about narrow spreads limiting participation. I think even if one person is bidding, many participants are competing. Aaron: Clarifying, you think that would reduce market participants? E: If the profit margins are smaller, then yes, there would be less participation. D: Still the problem with 1% or 3% rule. The 1% rule puts them at higher risk from MKR volatility. LFW: Aaron\u2019s Poll has \u201835% of votes winning\u2019 for \u20182% bid\u2019 currently,  \u20181% bid is 30% winning\u2019, and \u201813% votes for current or 3%\u2019. A: As the poll grows, maybe we\u2019ll put it on-chain. Cyrus: The only way to see if the market can sustain a smaller spread is just to try it, right? Then check the data and move it back if needed. Rich: Mariano, is this a high-frequency trading problem, regardless of the spread and mechanisms involved? Or just the system we have right now? C: Close but not quite. Data indicates people will tolerate a lower spread. As a result, they bid higher with the Gas auction to secure that bid position and guarantee the option. E.g., if the reward is $300, how much would you pay to win that $300? R: Clarifying, is this an auction or a race, there is no price discovery correct? C: Multiple bidders are fighting for that position. L: Because everyone knows that the bid is the 3% spread, it means that you can never bid less than 3% correlated with MKR price. If you want to win, you have to bid below the current MKR price speedily. C: One issue: MKR holders are losing out on 300Dai per auction, to keep the auctions swift. The question is whether 200 Dai is better. Right now, the benefit is speed.    24:17  David: Is the min bid increase a non-issue? What\u2019s the goal here? Is it to increase participation or bids? I think it looks like it\u2019s working perfectly fine.  Aaron: It\u2019s working great. The question is making it better for MKR holders. D: How would it help MKR holders, though? More burn compounding overtime? A: Bingo. Michael Newman: When we moved to this new system. 10K to participate is a push against smaller keepers. Maybe that\u2019s better for security, but it hurts smaller people like me. Rich: Are smaller lots better for smaller keepers? Cyrus: Assuming you\u2019re someone trying to offload MKR, secondary exchanges would be better for lower than 10k lots. Since liquidity has increased. The other problem is if lot sizes are too small, then the friction increases. You could look at it with auctions of 1000 Dai or even a retail-level of 100 Dai; auctions would be hitting all day. M: Flash loans also are here now. That evens the playing field again. C: Right, we didn\u2019t factor that in. SamM: Flash loans don\u2019t work for this since they need to happen in one block. Matthew Rabinowitz: If the spread instead of 3%, let\u2019s say it was 10% or even 20%, wouldn\u2019t that encourage more vibrant participation. D: If you had a 10%-20% min bid increase, that would break auctions and give unfairly large profit margins to auction keepers. MR: Possible yes, but wouldn\u2019t you encourage more people. You\u2019d bid against if you could potentially get a $1k reward. A: But then it\u2019s a gas battle. C: Miners are the only ones benefiting in that scenario. D: If someone bids 9% against price with 10 min bid increment, it\u2019s kind of the same. C: You could look at the price you pay to miners in gas as an indicator for altering the spread. To find the equilibrium point between gas cost and minimum bid.

A non-zero delay, due to bug fixes being done on-chain, makes reverse-engineering the bug a real risk.   1077\u00d7573 164 KB   First, this fix is developed and tested against the deployment, on Kovan. Then, a fingerprint of the bugfix is created from the bytecode, which will now be referred to as the dark fix. This takes the bytecode, predetermines the deployed address for that byte code, and then points that spell at the deploy address, which will be sitting on-chain unaddressed. In this way, you can\u2019t see the bytecode, which is why we call it the dark fix. Only that unique bytecode can deploy toward that unique address. There is a lot of security in this cryptographic primitive.   1072\u00d7576 155 KB   This solution allows a GSM delay without compromising security by avoiding having the bug fix sit open-source.   1070\u00d7570 146 KB   The social layer introduces complexity, but we do believe that this structure preserves MKR incentives.   1070\u00d7571 126 KB   Software always has bugs. There are trade-offs and drawbacks. Openly signaling a vulnerability is not ideal, as we would still have to wait for the GSM delay to apply fixes toward any attacks.   1078\u00d7569 157 KB   We\u2019re confident that this introduces a balance between governance attack exposure and still have some amount of secrecy around the bug. We do have a public repo of the fix that anyone can review.  Questions and Discussion 44:25  Rich: Essentially, we\u2019re placing a significant level of trust in a group of the largest Maker holders. Profit motives immediately drive these people. In terms of the social layer, how can we trust Maker holders and hold them accountable toward green-lighting these dark fixes?  Will: I\u2019d argue that you really can\u2019t. If they are a large MKR holder, all you can do is share the information and hope they\u2019re on board. R: Do these people need identification? Or is it based on the largest MKR wallets signing yes/no? Are there non-disclosure agreements? How do you contact these MKR holders? Wouter: This solution maps well on the gradual decentralization road map we have. In terms of the risk curve of critical code vulnerabilities, this will drop over time. Also, MKR distribution will get decentralized over time. In other words, it will become harder and harder to get in contact with these MKR holders as the MakerDAO project continues to grow, but the risk will also drop. R: What do the actual mechanics look like? Are there thresholds in place? W: Today, we\u2019ll have no issue contacting these people.    44:25  Cyrus: Before, there was a significant trust component. We asked the community to trust us to remove the GSM, activate the bug fix, and re-implement the GSM. Is there an improvement in this trust requirement with this dark-fix implementation?  Wouter: The improvement is more bounded in execution. If you have these major MKR stakeholders vouching for the vulnerability and proposed fix, and they agree that a specific solution for a particular vulnerability must be kept a secret for the good of the ecosystem, then this solution is an improvement. Just removing the GSM delay and fixing any general vulnerability opens up the risk of doing whatever one wants when fixing.  W: Additionally, the GSM is never removed for the dark fix. The community has the opportunity to call ES, or if they have the majority of the MKR, they can cancel the dark fix before being approved. I think this is significantly better than removing all guard rails and just asking the community to trust us.   Cyrus: So, the community can see the dark fix before during the delay period? Mariano: No, all they can see is that there is going to be one. But, the reassurance comes from some people verifying that they\u2019ve seen the fix. We can create a hash of that signoff. Rich: So, are the larger holders going to release a statement saying that they have seen it? M: We can write the code to fix a bug, can hash it to this fix, and we show the fix to the five largest MKR holders. These can look at the code, vouch that it fixes what needs fixing and put that spell on the blockchain as a hash. The code only exists on the blockchain once the GSM has passed. And it does everything in one transaction. It will only be openly visible on the mempool in the queue for mining. Thus, the code will not be available for long enough to be exploitable by anyone looking for vulnerabilities. M: That said, I\u2019m looking forward to the community\u2019s input on this. The MKR holders can see this code and can vote to unschedule the hash if they deem necessary. Wouter: To answer the specific question regarding how MKR holders would vouch for this and knowing that they did works like this. The most pseudonymous way to do it is to sign from an address holding a large amount of MKR. They reference the hash of the fix in the message. This makes it certain that the owner of the MKR is signing it and that they are approving the specific code that has that specific hash. R: They are staking reputation on their potential vouching for this fix. W: Yes, not only are they proving that they are signing, but they are also staking their reputation. So if there is a chance that the MKR holders can act nefariously, it would still be necessary to have the ES. R: ES is still an essential component of this system. There is still a significant decision that the community has to make, trusting the people who have seen the code. W: That\u2019s right. A trade-off where some trust is required, but it\u2019s the minimal amount of trust for precise, surgical operation in the system. R: Is this trust in a small group of people or a large group of people? This model works in a model with a small group of publicly identifiable and substantial holders. If that changes, the system won\u2019t work as well. W: Presumably, the more decentralized we get in the future, the lower the probability of vulnerabilities since it will be battle-tested. R: Presumably, that\u2019s by no means guaranteed. L: There is the chance of introducing a new series of bugs later on. W: Right, there is no perfect solution. But this is the best one as far as we\u2019ve reasoned it.    55:00  Cyrus: Why only the largest MKR holders? Is there a game-theory reason? Why not the developers?  Wouter: Fair point, you can include a mix of individuals with various amounts of stake. We can even have the community choose who looks at the code. Rich: Why not get KPMG or somebody involved in this. Someone who is bonded. Will Barnes: Right, an auditor from a security firm could work as a solution. W: Large MKR holders are necessary because they have enough MKR to pre-approve the fix. But you can include other trusted parties. L: Will you be preparing the largest MKR holders for this responsibility? W: You oftentimes have some time, say a week, before the vulnerability can be exploited. This gives you enough time to discuss with the MKR holders and audit this properly. Then, a vote can take place - executing the dark fix or proceeding with ES. R: There are other methods that can be explored. You can have highly visible, professional, international organizations auditing these security exploits. They can assure the large MKR holders have evaluated and signed off on this. They don\u2019t necessarily have to know the exploit, just that they trust the group that does. Mariano: Keep in mind that this is probably time-sensitive. It can be a fix that we find ourselves or a white-hat finds, but in all of this, we could be racing against time. LFW: We would need to confirm with these parties, as with the large Maker holders, that they are actually willing to be a part of this process and sign off. Wouter: Yes, we could prepare this. The weird thing about this solution is that we don\u2019t need to change anything in the system if we implement it. We\u2019ll have a week to determine whether this is the right strategy. R: There is some discussion to be had. So we\u2019ll put the proposal out and watch this over the next week or two? W: Yes, our recommendation is to give this at least a week for people to process this information. R: This is definitely an elegant solution. The issue of social coordination still makes me nervous.    1:01:49  C: Can we revisit this discussion regarding whether it is MKR holders or third-party people approving this fix? If we\u2019re optimizing for trust with larger holders, then aren\u2019t we creating privileged classes of holders that can see the fix vs. ones that can\u2019t?  Wouter: If I were a large holder, I would want to see the problems and proposed solutions. Rich: If I was a large holder, and I knew gossip about other holders, I would trade my not knowing to have them not know either. There is a lot of game theory to consider here. Though it could be interesting to see large holders add their confidence in the decision-making process, and not necessarily making the decision itself. LFW: Let\u2019s say there is a bug that needs to be fixed without revealing the exploit. Should there be a way to authorize money from the protocol to be taken toward paying for security audits to confirm that there is a bug as well as a verified fix? W: That might be mixing two conversations. Andy: With a bug, time is of the essence. It would take a long time to approve the funding, hire the third-party security team, and then fix the bug. As a dev, I would not feel comfortable letting a bug sit for that long in the wild. R: Well, at least this is a good first pass on the debate for these types of fixes. Hopefully, the forum thread for this fix will enable more discussions. Two weeks might be optimistic for having this thing go through, but we should kick-off this process.    Risk Vishesh State of the Peg Relevant links MCD system stats SCD system stats DAI & Sai 24hr VWAP Graphs Insights 1:06:16  1074\u00d7561 121 KB   Trading volumes for MCD have been higher than SCD in general. MCD trading at $24.36 Million. Significant chunks of activity due to a spike in ETH prices. In the past, we\u2019ve seen spikes in the $14-15 Million Sai range at certain times. It\u2019s interesting to compare spikes today to spikes in the past.   1076\u00d7468 174 KB   Dai is trading pretty close to the Peg. Starting from February 3rd/4th, there was some increase in trading activity with a greater spread above and tighter grouping below. From February 6th through the 9th, some trades slipped below\u2014some large lower trades, and then a few higher trades above. There was some double counting as the Kyber trade was relayed through Uniswap, but that is being worked on. A lot of activity due to people scrambling to obtain ETH and lever up.   1061\u00d7486 53.1 KB   The rise in ETH price leads to a rise in collateral value. There is a huge amount of collateralization in the upper half of the graph. About 1/3 of the graph or 37 million MCD is collateralized around 300%. Some go down to about 175% collateralized. This is a bit more like the graphs we saw from SCD. It will be interesting to see how this changes over the next few days. As ETH price rises, people tend to pull collateral out to realize profits. We\u2019ll be looking to see whether this collateralization sticks, or whether ETH prices will continue to rise higher.   1059\u00d7503 112 KB   121 million Dai. 117 Million of which is from ETH, 1.6 million coming from BAT.    56.75% Dai in DSR. Short of inefficiencies, there is no reason why most of the MCD supply shouldn\u2019t end up in DSR.   787\u00d7521 108 KB   The steady growth of the Dai + Sai supply over time in comparison to the Sai supply. Noticeable increase in the last few weeks.   959\u00d7560 191 KB   Top 100 vaults continue to have 83% of the Dai supply.  Questions to Vishesh 1:13:07  Rich: Is there an optimum level that we should be expecting in the DSR? Shouldn\u2019t we want a portion Dai to be used, to be in motion?  Vishesh: Hard to say what\u2019s expected. This will probably top out at 75%. The things keeping Dai out of DSR are: trust, lack of awareness, moving it too quickly in usage, or someone supplying it elsewhere for a better ratio or using it as collateral as well.  Locked is a bad word. The value is not actually \u201clocked.\u201d This number does creep up slowly. It could potentially get up the 70\u2019s, but its interesting to know that the proportion has gotten up with total Dai. As people are purchasing Dai, they are ultimately putting it in the DSR. If you have Dai and are holding it, there is no reason not to supply it either here or elsewhere. The interesting thing to note is the amount of Dai in DSR inclusive of where else it is provided for yield - whether that be dYdX or wherever else it is provided for collateral. If you subtract all of those stagnant pools of Dai, you can get what is left circulating freely.      Links from the Chat  DarkFix public repo  Credits  Tim Black produced this summary.

LongForWisdom will walk us through a new iteration of the Governance dashboard. I\u2019d love for this group to evaluate it together. We love feedback and suggestions for improvement, so please feel free to tell us. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   LongForWisdom Dashboard Presentation 2:37  1217\u00d7816 136 KB    This is the Governance Analytics dashboard created with the team at Protofire. The home page has several metrics that bring insights into Maker Governance data. Each of these metrics views are interactive. E.g., staked MKR or votes. Hopefully, we can start to illuminate Governance operations or overhead.    We\u2019ve also added help text/context to each of these metrics(they\u2019re the i in the top right corner.) The insight includes links to the sub-query. One common complaint is the widget has a slow loading time. It\u2019s often querying the blockchain, we\u2019ve had this discussion before and will come up with improvements.   1071\u00d7358 34.9 KB   MKR responsiveness measures how quickly votes go live. On average, 25K MKR responds to an executive the first day it goes live. Responsiveness gives a baseline idea of how much MKR we could rely on for emergency responses. Also, if an executive is popular, you can see the visual indicator. It\u2019s an average figure, and there is some nuance with that calculation.    Similar view for polls. Breakdown of responsiveness per day.   1341\u00d7812 28.9 KB    Voters has a leader board.

We\u2019ve complained about whales, but now that trend is more visible, and voting is more distributed than we thought.  Questions and Discussion 7:33  Rich: We could split polls up by hours though right since the cap is usually a week?  L: I suppose we could, sometimes polls can be longer than a week, though. A cap might be a good idea. D: The data is mixed since some polls have a longer duration.    9:17  D: Those are vote proxy addresses, right?  L: Need to double-check. They don\u2019t attach to the contract, so they may not be proxies. The dashboard might be missing cold or hot wallet interactions. Regardless, if you click on the address, you can see how it voted.    14:24  D: Do we have the same level of detail for Executive Votes? I know executives don\u2019t auto-populate their information as polls do.  L: The data lives on GitHub, and a hash on chain links back to the poll, so we don\u2019t have the same for executives at the moment. D: Conceptually, in the future, couldn\u2019t we just vote directly from this page? L: Yes!    18:48  R: You can see the volume and also the distribution. As long as it\u2019s reasonably flat, you can assume an alignment.  L: Perhaps. R: It doesn\u2019t say what they voted for. L: That\u2019s an option we don\u2019t have, but we could look into displaying which vote by address size.    20:01  C: How could we use this to make Governance more efficient? What voting information we should address in future governance.  L: Much of these metrics are for current and not historic state. We don\u2019t track efficiency, though health and distribution is kind of close. E.g., 62k on the hat could be larger and, thus, safer. Tracking what increases voter participation is more complicated. Total votes kind of tracks efficiency. Rate of change on votes adds insight too.    21:49   Matthew: Any way to check about sitting on an old executive? Showing what might be theoretically lost?  L: Perhaps. One measure I\u2019ve been evaluating is \u201chow active is MKR.\u201d The idea of that is daily, monthly, and quarterly activity would help us spec out what is available in an emergency. Diving into that metric would be helpful. D: It shows us who the protocol politicians will be too. L: Once we have vote-delegation, then yes, people will point to votes and say, \u201crely on me for consistency.\u201d Assuming, of course, we have delegation in the future.    Mitote chat: If the address holding the MKR has other non-voting activity we can know if they didn\u2019t get hit by a bus right?:  L: Potentially a \u201ctime since last active\u201d for addresses that are larger maker holders. Tons of ideas we could do to confirm activity.    26:42  Kenton: Does anyone know the status on mkr.tools? If there might be a v2?  R: Pretty sure he needs a robust API, so he doesn\u2019t have to scratch it out for MCD. Taking the opportunity to plug the community grants and team. The models are the same in Governance and with the community grants. We are interested in evaluating proposals that look like this dash. R: That\u2019s how Protofire did it. They came with an idea and went through the grants process. Low and behold, we have this as a result.    Forum Activity Recap 29:11  Governance at a Glance Thread  Should BAT SF be reduced?  A new member of the forum asks about the BAT stability fee and whether it should be reduced, which prompts some discussion of asset-locked to market-cap ratios and other thoughts.    Seeking signal   Should we have another executive vote regarding the Governance Security Module?  In which I ask for more information about the risks and benefits of activating the governance security module, and ask other people\u2019s opinions on the matter. Next Thursday, there is a segment that is prepared by Wouter.    Signal Request/Discussion: Should we implement a tax during SCD Shutdown to recuperate unpaid Stability Fees? 1  Continuing the thread from Aaron, where he presents a thread within which to discuss SCD shutdown, particularly the use of the tax parameter. This expanded into a discussion of several options related to Emergency Shutdown.    Signal Request: How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes?  I combine the previous signal requests about bundling into a single request that asks for how specifically we should deal with bundled executives. Regroup Monday to find out when this goes on-chain.    Discussion 29:46  David: BAT SF question, is it ever possible to have an SF lower than the current DSR? My understanding is no because you could just issue that DAI and put in the DSR for that spread.  C: We\u2019ve talked about subsidizing other collateral and locking it in the DSR. If it\u2019s small amounts. It\u2019s technically possible, e.g., when the Sai SF was lower than the DSR. People would mint Sai, migrate, and lock it up; nothing broke, although that\u2019s not the best behavior. D: For example, BAT SF is 5% while the DSR is 8.75%; in this situation, although they would be able to mint Dai and earn on the spread, some portion of the borrowing would be healthy, not just there to capture the spread. C: If we wanted to do that for BAT, I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019d do it specifically for BAT, but it\u2019s possible. L: The main benefit is diversification or subsidizing for diversification. Dai that\u2019s created and locked up is essentially parasitic since it will go back into the DSR, gaining only diversification. MR: If you lock in DSR, it\u2019s pure risk. Especially since the downside is on a volatile price change and liquidations. It costs the Maker community capital to subsidize the collateral.    34:53  Cyrus: The Sai supply is still going down, so Aaron\u2019s thread is relevant but not urgent. Until we see the resulting interactions slow down (E.g., closing CDPs and SFs, etc.), it\u2019s still a premature discussion. There is still migration every week. For example, a large DeFi platform migrated $1-2 million Sai. The peg is drifting and getting weaker, though.  L: I saw a large trade on Uniswap for $.90 C: That provides incentives for CDP holders to repay. S: Unless they\u2019re waiting for ES, where they get fees forgiven due to peg drift. David: chat Does it make sense to publicly say that the Sai peg is not reliable, or is becoming less and less reliable as the supply dwindles? C: People selling Sai right now are bearing the cost of forgiven fees. If it drops to $.90 for a more extended time. D: Who is the buyer? C: Who is the seller? Why are people selling Sai?    37:52  Matthew: Going back to our core objective, if the risk profile stays the same, and we keep lowering the debt ceiling to amount outstanding. Risk is hedged, and the system is exposed. The risk doesn\u2019t go away, but it just shuts it off. The SFs get waved. When I went through this cycle, asking for opinions from other professionals, we asked: what advantage do we gain if the risk doesn\u2019t change? The only thing that changes is recouping fees in MKR. If the peg drifts no one is using it much right, it\u2019s unusable?  C: It\u2019s not great for the Maker brand to have an old version and see the peg drift. Secondly, if ES isn\u2019t going to happen soon, that hurts the peg further. M: Trying to find a perfect solution isn\u2019t going to work. It\u2019s a communication issue. D: Does it make sense that if the migration contract exists and significant liquidity is in it and available, that we\u2019re still providing an \u201cout\u201d and taking care of the end-user? L: We\u2019re assuming bad actors, but there hasn\u2019t been enough liquidity for someone as large as 3088. M: Tools exist for partial transfers. D: Also, we\u2019re not here to guess motives. We just provide a solution where possible. L: 3088 could be waiting for ES without having to pay a ridiculous amount. Trying to source his balance on the open market, it\u2019s also not in the migration contract, is going to be impossible.    Risk Primoz Kordez Analysis 44:44  829\u00d7573 118 KB   Dai Supply went up about 5 million to a total of 111.7 million Dai.  Net minting was not that high, ~2 million Dai over the last week.   There is a lot of Sai being migrated to MCD, about 3 million over the last week.  Two days ago, a large sum was migrated from Nexo, roughly 1.4 million Sai. About 1.7 million of the 3 million Sai was used by CDP\u2019s to migrate to MCD as well. Two larger CDPs migrated last week, paid about 100,000 in fees.     953\u00d7747 35.7 KB   The total supply of Dai+Sai is still increasing at a similar rate. Only a net 2 million Dai was printed last week, which is low considering the recent ETH price rally. Historically, large increases in ETH correspond to increase DAI minting.   741\u00d7714 115 KB    Defiexplorer.com/stats shows aggregate repayments and draws for collateral being added in MCD. This can be used to check how much Dai was generated in MCD. You can see a large withdrawal of ETH; this pushed the amount of ETH locked in MCD bellow 2 million. I\u2019m guessing that this is happening because the CR is very high, at 381%, CDP owners are withdrawing the unnecessary capital from collateral.   1078\u00d7572 81.2 KB    What surprised me is how high the Sai CR is at 427%, as it is usually lower than the Dai CR. I\u2019m guessing this is due to general inactivity in SCD - Half of the debt is in CDP\u2019s that are inactive for more than six months. These CDP\u2019s are simply not migrating. They aren\u2019t even withdrawing collateral.   Sai DC is at 30 million. As the Sai supply is at 23.2 million, the SCD DC leaves about 8 million.  Cyrus: Wouldn\u2019t the Sai CR be one of the few indicators of CDP owner activity? That behavior shouldn\u2019t differ that much from MCD to SCD. You can\u2019t go by the Dai supply because they won\u2019t be adding or wiping debt due to risks from the peg and potential tax. P: Exactly, this was my point. If you think about it, we\u2019ve seen even higher CRs. The ratio itself is related to leverage. One theory is that they are not active. The other is that they are ok leaving ETH in collateral without removing it and converting it to something stable. This might tell you that they are really bullish. I\u2019m leaning toward the first option that they are inactive.  C: If they wanted to leave it in deliberately, then so would the MCD CDP holders. Why would there be a difference? P: True.      There is a buffer of 8 million available for Sai minting, including Sai burned in the migration contract. This should be enough if there is a sudden SAI liquidity shortage if new Sai needs to be minted.  On the other hand, there are debates that perhaps we don\u2019t want to have too high of a buffer. We don\u2019t want to see unnecessary Sai printing.     1081\u00d7573 105 KB   Because of this, I checked if there was any Sai minting in the last few weeks. From the top 100 CDP data from MakerScan, you can check how much is minted. The numbers are actually low; I haven\u2019t noticed any new SCD CDP\u2019s trying to mint a significant amount of Sai.  At most, you can see some CDP\u2019s using SCD and minting a few thousand Sai.       Dai in DSR at an all-time high at 55 million Dai, probably because the DSR is also at an all-time high at 8.75%. I noticed that on Compound, the DAI lending market surpassed the USDC lending market.  Just last month, I saw the Dai supply in Compound go from 20 to 30 million. I\u2019m also guessing this ratio will increase in favor of Dai vs. USDC. The last time we saw Dai lenders dominating USDC was five months ago, even before the migration. I believe the Dai rate will dominate because the supply rate is much higher for Dai. The unutilized part goes to DSR. In Compound, this isn\u2019t the case.   Sai still has some liquidity in Compound, not sure why this is not reducing. In the last few weeks, remaining Sai liquidity has become sticky.   1630\u00d7382 411 KB   cDai supply in Compound increased to almost 30 million in USD.   1877\u00d7588 163 KB   This graph shows grouped addresses by the amount of Sai held. There are three categories: those holding 10,000 Sai to 100,000 Sai, ones holding 100,000 - 1 million Sai, and the ones holding 1 million+ Sai. These 300 addresses hold 22 million of the Sai, which is 90% of the Sai supply.   1881\u00d7529 87.8 KB   300 addresses are represented by these wallets.    Only 100 Sai holders represent 80% of the supply.   843\u00d7813 226 KB   Top 100 CDP holders reflect a similar metric, with 85.58% of Dai held. We are waiting for 100 Sai addresses to match with the 100 top CDP\u2019s. If they migrate all at once, we would only be left to 10-15% of supply available currently at a few million Sai. Estimating 200-300 people who we are waiting for migration of the last few million Sai.     I\u2019ve checked which CDP\u2019s have migrated. This table showed two weeks ago when I wanted to estimate how the debt is structured in CDP, including who is wiping the debt and minting the debt. I wanted to see what changed in the last 17 days.  I\u2019ve noticed that migration is still going on. Since Jan 20th, 8 CDP\u2019s have migrated for a total of 4 million Sai debt repaid and 336,724 in fees paid. These CDP\u2019s who have migrated were active during the migration period. We are still not seeing any activity in the formerly inactive CDP\u2019s, even in the last few weeks.      Around 10 CDP\u2019s migrate daily, proving that migration is still under way. I\u2019m not sure whether this page shows partial or complete migration.   943\u00d7300 56.3 KB   Here I\u2019ve noticed a large increase in migration contracts. This is the spike I noticed two days ago when Nexo migrated.  ",

                    "content": "Questions and Discussion 57:48  David: There was a thread about revisiting the Governance Security Module framework. I was curious about Derek\u2019s perspective on whether it\u2019s appropriate to bring this up again? Do we want a process defined and spec-ed out for solving potential bugs to get around a delay? If one existed.  Derek: The latest on that was that Wouter Kampmann was having a conversation with the smart contracts team yesterday evening. He is going to come back to us next week. C: They are working on middle-of-the-road, hybrid solutions to get us the best of both worlds for the short term. We need to be a bit more patient with waiting for the technical team to respond. S: He said they have a positive result, seems promising.    59:21  SamM: About two weeks ago, I started a poll for reducing the frequency governance vote about the DSR spread. I feel as though weekly votes are excessive.  R: Recap fo the thread would be nice. I\u2019m the poor sap that has to enter these things every week. I agree with the content of this poll.  Do we feel like the ecosystem understands what a spread is? As opposed to the previous votes? Have they internalized what this thing actually implies? Mostly, the range is a back-and-forth between MKR maximalists and DSR maximalists/interest seekers. We\u2019ve seen the ecosystem settle on this. We\u2019ve done it for two weeks, and we have feedback based on current market conditions.   Cyrus: I have a few thoughts on that. We should keep repeating information about the spread to keep the community informed. There are still two polls, only now it\u2019s spread instead of DSR, with the SF poll. There are no gains in efficiency. The spread is representative of underlying collateral that should be a slow-moving number.  The spread should not be changing from week to week, presumably because the quality of the collateral should not be something that changes often. In theory, we could reduce that frequency. The community should vote on the DSR spread, and, barring any significant events, they shouldn\u2019t need to think about that again for a month or a quarter. Instead, they would vote on SF\u2019s instead, reducing the number of polls every week.   D: To see if people understand the spread vs. manual rate setting, we might need to compare the polls from the spread vs. the polls from DSR adjustment. Perhaps we can compare the addresses from both. S: The initial DSR spread had ~72k MKR voting. I can\u2019t recall a governance poll that had a higher number. L: Confirmed, it\u2019s one of the top votes.    1:03:08  Rich: Related topic starter, our voting cadence: this discussion of operational overhead and cognitive overhead that directly leads to apathy in engagement. Though potentially inflammatory, we need a discussion about conclusive poll result evidence. Are those effective lever mechanisms? For example, this week, unusual activity in the market due to ETH prices may have played a larger role than the results of the governance poll.  Ideally, Scientific governance means knowing our actions affect the market and measuring it. I am not convinced that we\u2019re at that point yet. Let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that our initiatives may or may not have an impact. Polls and votes every week may not give us enough time to determine whether our activity is effective. Cyrus, is there a way for us to determine the effectiveness of our governance activity statistically?  Cyrus: I don\u2019t think we can ever definitively prove causation. R: Well, can we narrow it down? With a sufficient data set, we may be able to determine that there is an effect. I want to know if, for example, the market will provide homeostasis for something like the peg vs. us making changes every week and potentially affecting the market. Would historical data be able to determine this? Cyrus: Regardless of whether it had any effect or not, the data will show that it was effective because the peg is still exactly where it needs to be. R: I think the data will show a sizable amount of time where the peg remained stable despite us not doing anything. I want to know whether this will be the case over, say, six weeks of no voting vs. week to week voting. I know that no one can predict the market and that it is an irrational space, but it\u2019s worth devoting some thought regarding whether what we do on a week-to-week basis affects the market. C: We\u2019ll put some resources into that. It will be hard to prove a definitive cause-and-effect relationship.      1:08:48  D: Do we lose anything from reducing the cadence? For example, biweekly?  R: I\u2019ve seen a weak executive vote go through, and there was little impact on the peg. L: I think testing different cadences is a good idea. We can define a trial period of a certain amount of time to test this idea. R: I\u2019m just concerned about the human cognitive pitfall of trying to find a narrative through graph information. People grasp for correlations that may not be there.    1:11:27  Vishesh: This is not a new conversation. We have additional complexity because of the DSR. Sifting out what is going on is not easy. It\u2019s not clean. It will be hard for us to reuse data from the SCD world for the MCD world due to fundamental differences.  The other point is that the stability of the peg is not attributed to the stability fee. Mostly, it is due to differences in the ETH price ecosystem, due to increased aggregate amount of Dai supply and demand (compared to the past), and a lot more maturity in the liquidity of Dai and people\u2019s desire to market make Dai.  A lot of factors at play, many of them attributed to the stability of the peg. This correlation is harder to measure; people cling to the SF as a driver of determination because it can be estimated, and that is human psychological bias. I think there are external forces we do not include that are, likely, driving a lot more than we think.   R: We can\u2019t underestimate the impact of this dawning awareness from the ecosystem: we\u2019re actively managing the peg. This encourages external factors to take it seriously, to hedge, to look for arbitrage opportunities. The confidence of actually having things happen could potentially have more current value than the lever-action of moving things a couple of data points every single week. Cyrus: Anecdotally, there is plenty of evidence that shows that SF going up increases public response from the community about fees. R: I\u2019m not saying that these actions aren\u2019t practical. I just don\u2019t know whether seven days is enough of a time to measure the effects vs. perhaps some other confounding factors contributing to the impact. Maybe we need to wait every two or three weeks. C: Broadly, it works, but do we have to require a signal increase, and, if so, is it worth the overhead? That\u2019s a good question. SamM: As an example of overhead/confusion, this week, I missed a data point and accidentally voted to change the SF amount instead of keeping it in the same. I wonder about those parameters affecting other voters.    1:17:20  Rich: To give the executive the maximum amount of time to pass, I put these up Sunday at ~ 11 PM. For the last few weeks, this has been nerve-wracking. With an almost 50/50 split on executive votes anticipating an accurate poll range for the following week is difficult. It\u2019s guesswork on whether an executive will pass. If an executive passes quickly, then it could skew the polls since they don\u2019t represent the correct range.  The other thing, these polls go in with a snapshot of the system that is three hours old, how can we operate under such short time-frames for votes? C: Can acknowledge some positive impact. If it were completely useless, we would see executive polls without change. R: That viewpoint assumes rational actors. Executives reflect the current state of the system. People are reactive instead of observing long-term trends. V: I agree with Rich. Knee-jerking is the usual reaction from the community. When the peg is below, there is a call to raise SF. When above, it\u2019s there to lower the SF. Not saying that the actual quantitative impact of changes is predictable, the urge to react is.  We don\u2019t have a clear picture of that impact\u2019s repercussions, but we know that it has an impact. There isn\u2019t a definite end to end process. The point to consider: what is the effect of your actions and the most direct way to solve problems? For example, if the peg is low because of too much floating Dai, you raise SF to pay back debt purchasing some Dai. The question colors the actions. E.g., with a lowering peg motivating actors, what are they doing that for? is there enough of a delta between those rates? Will that increased SF motivate a move to Compound? With a 1-2% change in SF, you\u2019re not likely to change positions based on ETH. The change would be for the peg; by soaking up Dai on the open market, they would fix the price.   With the DSR, though, the additional lever. Is that a more direct way to soak up Dai on the open market? My answer is yes. 9% is pretty attractive and has a high utilization. Do you want the DSR to be a flat yield lever? Or something that you move to pull Dai off the market. R: Excellent points. Two avenues: how do we determine the impact and where to get that information. What mechanisms are in place that could explain them. With enough background noise and pretty graphs, are people inclined to arbitrage?  Have we seen new mechanisms? I agree with Vishesh that DSR has a significant impact. SF is a more nebulous stick that has long term effects for MKR holders. The immediacy is less concrete. Are we hurting ourselves, asking people to do research every week? Or are we maintaining momentum? Should we consider a system where cause & effect are more transparent?      1:26:06  V: A good framing is what does it take to justify making those changes? You\u2019d have to be confident that the correlation takes less than seven days to track  R: Also, wouldn\u2019t it also be a direct correlation, somewhat? E.g., \u2018the SF moved this much,\u2019 and the \u2018peg moved that much.\u2019 Within a standard deviation. V: The direct correlation opens a discussion about how you choose to measure the peg. It\u2019s stylistic to look at a 24-hour weighted average.  If the volume is low and you\u2019re looking beyond 24 hours, yet timely overall volume is below the peg, say 25 hours ago, it averages out to above the peg. Looking at that price to drive decisions with flexibility is my point.   C: What about Mondays, look at the 24-hour weighted price, and if it\u2019s within a small percentage, we forgo the vote? V: My point is that 24 hours might be too naive to find the nuance of levers\u2019 effects. R: E.g., a 30-day, 7-day, and 24-hour snapshot would be helpful. V: Different momentum changes would help to narrow it down. If the price has cratered in 24 hours, that would be a reasonable correction. R: Another question: if it craters, how long until it recovers? With a significant deviation, how much would Governance activity correct the peg? V: The presupposition is that governance activity is correcting the peg. There is the time involved with ETH price changes. Arbitrage takes time, order books change, and that requires more in-depth study. R: Let\u2019s say I\u2019m an uneducated user and see ETH has jumped to $212, but the peg hasn\u2019t done anything, where is the reconciliation? V: I see the peg stability at $212 Eth vs. $160 is two different conversations/viewpoints. Having a more holistic discussion, outside of price, is essential. It\u2019s primarily about time frames. I would be shocked if Governance actions on a weekly scale can quickly correct economic instabilities. R: I have the same skepticism. It seems more like forward guidance that is more social and has cultural implications. V: It would be more interesting to see when the peg drifts and recovers on its own without Governance action. In the SCD world, this didn\u2019t happen, because changes would happen before reverberating outward. The peg\u2019s autonomy is an important data point, what does the system do if Dai goes below peg, does it get worse, or does the system recover? R: We don\u2019t need to play chicken with the system, but experimenting with the cadence might be a good first step. The community could decide, \u201ctwo weeks, let\u2019s try.\u201d From there, we could figure out the baseline and make the next change.    1:34:39  L: From sidebar conversation in chat, I agree with Vishesh, we should evaluate larger time frames.  Sam suggested a seven-day exponential decay version. I then suggested multiple moving averages: 24 hours, 7-day, 30-day. Sam argued it might be more relevant to weigh today versus yesterday. V: The gist was, empirically, it would make sense to weight today heavier than yesterday. The question is, are larger trades or recent trades more critical? Which means it\u2019s different now. If a trade is 10x larger, do you weight 10x more, if a trade is one day old, is it weighted 2x or more? Determining that scale is a super nerdy quantitative discussion. L: Could there be a cool graph? V: (Sighs in revelatory awesome-ness) Yes, that would be fun to mockup. Sam: I could add that to Dai peg.   R: I\u2019d love to see that addition to Dai peg.

We are intensely interested in dealing with governance and process issues; don\u2019t hesitate to participate in the call and post-call discussion. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Risk Vishesh Dai Analytics 03:17  Relevant links Santiment Maker Data Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Insights  Dai is up a significant amount. On September 15th we saw 4.5MM Dai minted.  The increase in Dai happened as a result of refinancing from Compound, as well as an uptick in leveraging activity.  QgUHVsN.png817\u00d7491 121 KB     Collateral levels are up as well. On September 15th around 63,000 ETH was added as collateral.  qf4ITZf.png815\u00d7487 113 KB   Dai price has come closer to the $1 target.  Volume over 24 hours has been relatively low. The newly minted Dai was not immediately dumped on the market. It\u2019s been a pleasant surprise to see that all the newly minted Dai has not caused the Dai price to fall as much as expected. This new Dai may be sold over the coming days, so I would still pay attention to the markets.  rylARNG.jpg1550\u00d7757 154 KB     The seven-day VWAP has moved closer to $1  17MM volume over the last seven days, which is average volume.  9wgoGeJ.jpg1538\u00d7654 139 KB      Secondary Lending Platforms  When the 12.5% SF adjustment occurred, for a few days there wasn\u2019t much change in activity on SLPs. For a while, the Maker rate was cheaper than Compound.  QitLDIL.png1861\u00d7775 68.6 KB   The borrow volume dipped on the 15th, as refinance of a couple of large borrowers from Compound to Maker occurred.  Questions for Vishesh   07:14: On Sep 15th, was it only one significant position that refinanced from Compound to MakerDAO that causes this large blip in the data?  Yes, it was primarily one or two large positions, but what is interesting is that it wasn\u2019t just a refinancing since these positions being reopened on Maker resulted in new Dai entering circulation.    Collateral Discussion Fluidity Team members: Mark Fernandes, Britton Overall, and Jeff Amico Presentation: 11:20   The goal is to present and think through this idea, which we think would be a great inclusion into the MakerDAO system.  zH0841C.jpg1527\u00d7858 135 KB    Ec5980T.jpg1550\u00d7852 89.2 KB   Doing our part to make Dai grow, we released Tokenized Asset Portfolios earlier this year, intending to use TAP to be able to use synthetic assets in MCD.  WIstyH0.jpg1553\u00d7857 125 KB   The TAP introduces one single framework for the legal, technical, and operational needs that makes sure the liquidation process happens seamlessly.  00Xie7L.jpg1552\u00d7835 90.2 KB    RoFrbs0.jpg1549\u00d7863 138 KB   We used this structure in July, in a pilot we did with US Treasuries. We went through a process of mimicking how this would work end-to-end. The treasuries were bought and then held by a custodian. Tokens were issued against these Treasuries. We pledged that token as collateral in Kovan MCD and drew some test-Dai. We created an Oracle to monitor the price of Treasuries for the next few days. We then went through the process of returning the test-Dai and closing the CDP. The whitepaper contains more granular detail about this entire process.  ngJFcMD.jpg1552\u00d7853 179 KB   We received a lot of feedback from the Ethereum, Defi, and Maker communities that we are in the process of implementing some of that feedback.  qZjGxbK.jpg1552\u00d7856 85.8 KB    r9kbNqR.jpg1552\u00d7859 112 KB    M3H4l62.jpg1558\u00d7820 82 KB    Proposed Additions to the Collateral Onboarding App for Synthetic Assets  Open to feedback, comment in the thread. These are their recommendations for questions around synthetic assets.  MZJm3HR.jpg1555\u00d7855 104 KB    UzezKWg.png1212\u00d7675 115 KB     Ultimately our goal is to introduce US Treasuries under the TAP system into MCD as collateral. For Dai to scale, it requires users to be confident in its backing collateral. Because US Treasuries are very stable and liquid, the likelihood of liquidation is very low.  YFIHO3z.png1213\u00d7664 75.2 KB   Over the next several months, we will be working with the community to better this mechanism, and move it forward to enhance MCD.  Questions to the Fluidity Team   22:27: How is transparency & trust managed with the use of these additional entities? Is it regulatory? Are there Oracles that can prove certain things?  First, you have an Oracle that would connect to the Trust\u2019s custody account at all times, such that the MCD system would know that the securities are held there and have not been transferred to a different brokerage account. In the event of a liquidation, some of the feedback we received is, how do you deal with the Sponsor filing bankruptcy and filing a stay on the assets? How does a Keeper know they will be made whole during a liquidation? To address that, we designate the keepers as the legal beneficiaries of the Trust account. Therefore that entity will have a legal obligation to the Keepers. The combination of the on-chain mechanism and legal mechanism helps safeguard this framework. The trust is an independent third party whose existence ensures the recourse process.    26:24: I want to make sure I understand the redemption process and its permissionless property of being a Keeper. Is it the case here that the redemption/recourse flow is open to anybody? Or are there restrictions on which types of persons or legal entities can participate in this process?  The way we envision it, there will be a way for keepers to redeem post-auction collateral for Dai through Fluidity. Assuming that Fluidity is in the picture and solvent, we would return Dai for every token deposited. The trust mechanism I describe is a last resort. It assumes Fluidity is not in the picture and acts as a safeguard to make sure Keepers get value back for the tokens that they purchased. Because it\u2019s a regulated trust entity, there will need to be regular KYC on the participants who are bringing the token back. Any transaction there would need to be legally compliant. Though we don\u2019t envision materially restricting the type of people who could bring a token back for redemption, so long as they are not sanctioned or on some explicitly restricted list, Fluidity should be able to handle those redemptions.    29:00: Is there a difference in cost between participating as a US compliant entity or a pseudonymous entity?  There would be no difference in cost.    29:38: What is the anticipated duration of any given liquidation event? i.e., how long does it take for a Keeper to get paid?  One of the reasons we chose US Treasuries as the first pilot asset to try this framework is because US Treasuries are a huge and liquid market. The liquidation process would involve the keeper bringing the token to Fluidity/the Trust, which would then we able to provide them with DAI/USD in exchange for that token. This presumes that the underlying assets were liquidated effectively. We think US Treasuries are perfect as a test case because of the liquidity in their markets. We think this can all happen on the same day.  ljquk10.jpg1556\u00d7856 103 KB      32:00: It looks like there are a lot of middle-men in this model. Doesn\u2019t this eat into the profit margins of the end-users? Is there a way to get rid of these middle-men?  It\u2019s ultimately a balance between reducing intermediaries and using a robust system that can maintain the integrity of the Dai system in the event of a liquidation. We think these middle-men may ultimately be necessary to give the system assurance that in the event of liquidation that the Keepers would be made whole. The introduction of these intermediaries attempts to lower the counterparty risk.    36:35: What is the primary reason for all the additional proposed questions for synthetic assets? Is it that synthetic has so many real-world interactions compared to pure crypto assets? Yes, exactly. Interacting with additional third parties warrants further questioning. Also, considering that off-chain data will be needed to facilitate the collateral, it\u2019s essential to ask questions to define better the context for how that data is handled.  42:03: You make the point that US Treasuries have a fixed rate of return, which makes it very easy to see when the rate of return exceeds or is less than the Stability Fee. Would that not result in the entire collateral pool for Treasuries disappearing and reappearing as a result of this threshold?  We believe people will hold their positions that they will not be able to get out of immediately. So there won\u2019t be an immediate action to close CDPs. Based on how users have used Dai to get returns elsewhere, we see that there may be cases where users decide to keep their CDPs open even if the SF is high.    44:12: More on the philosophical side, let\u2019s say the Maker community adopts the TAP framework. Let\u2019s say some significant portion of collateral is in this framework. What then do you think differentiates the Maker system, for creating Dai, from something like Tether or USDC. In so far as much of the recourse mechanisms start to look similar in this model. Why is Maker a better, trust-minimizing alternative to systems in that world?  Users are still given the option to open CDPs in a fully permissionless way; even if Treasuries make up a substantial portion of the collateral pool, it doesn\u2019t restrict users from opening CDPs using ETH or other permissionless assets. Additionally, the mechanisms by which the risk of the assets is monitored and controlled remain the same. There is over-collateralization required, a Stability Fee that is determined by Maker Governance, and ultimately has decentralized governance managing this collateral type in the system. The decision making around this asset type is in the hands of the people monitoring and controlling for the risk in a public fashion.    46:23: Continued: Let\u2019s say the majority of Dai is issued from a regulated, off-chain asset. How would a 3rd party view Dai itself as an asset, from a risk perspective? Does it begin to look more similar to something like USDC?  Another distinction is the option to obtain leverage in Dai, which is not available in the USDC/Tether infrastructure. This continues to distinguish Dai, fundamentally. There\u2019s always some degree of regulatory shutdown/backdoor risk. While it may not be as explicit with MCD, there will still be regulatory chokepoints that can be exploited to hurt Maker regardless. Relatedly, there is a balance and a tradeoff that is present here. We think the value for scaling Dai outweighs the increased backdoor risk synthetics and off-chain asset carry.    52:24: What are the use cases for US Treasury TAPs? Can they be used for exposure to US Treasuries outside of their use as collateral for CDPs?  No, we are designing these specifically for CDP collateral. These are purely a receipt whose sole purpose is to sit inside of a CDP and to reflect the value of the underlying treasuries.    53:34: How much of this has been built? How far are you from the launch?  We\u2019re far along in conversation with Trust partners who understand the structure we are talking about, who think they can handle liquidation, the redemption of tokens, and things like that. The overall structure, from a legal standpoint, works. We\u2019ve built out the contracts, the tokens, the accessory scripts that would interact with MCD, and we\u2019ve built Oracles off of one of the custodians we are working within the Pilot. We will need to upgrade various things as MCD officially rolls out, in addition to building more resilient Oracles once Maker\u2019s risk team decides on the standards for them.    56:34: I believe you said that Keepers wouldn\u2019t be required to KYC to participate in collateral auctions, is that correct?  Yes, Keepers would be able to interact with Fluidity rather than the trust directly to redeem those tokens for Dai.   Question continued: An extension to that, then, is in the event of an Emergency Shutdown/Global Settlement would Fluidity be able to facilitate the redemption of all the collateral tokens?  I don\u2019t see why not. Anyone who has a TAP token would be able to redeem it for Dai, but in the case of ES, we would have to pay out TAP token holders in USD. TAP tokens would be fungible with no transfer restrictions, so users would be able to offload their TAP tokens without needing to KYC themselves.    01:02:08: What are your thoughts on bringing in a 3rd party legal \u201crisk-team,\u201d to help evaluate some of the questions around this framework?  In parallel to community feedback about the legal mechanisms of this framework, we\u2019ve been working with external counsel in structuring this and getting assurance that it complies with all applicable regulations. Of course, we welcome further feedback from the community, whether it\u2019s informal or through a 3rd party risk-team.   Continued: My(Cyrus) impression is that there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty in the crypto-world as a whole. I think many crypto-lawyers are just waiting for more guidance. To what extent should that risk be mitigated by waiting for more clarity? What counsel is able to make the necessary useful guidance at this point?  I think an agency like the SEC plays it close to the vest. They do provide some guidance. We think that this instrument complies with their frameworks. We\u2019ve also examined this framework under other regulatory regimes. With any new tech, there will be regulatory grey areas. The best thing we can do is to structure this framework along what we see in the current regulatory environment.    Governance LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 01:08:06   Not too much new forum activity this week. Discussion has been happening around Stablecoins as collateral, and the DSR discussion. Governance at a Glance Thread  What\u2019s the point of adding stable coins as collateral?  Rune shares some thoughts on the value of stable-coins as collateral. Benefits and downsides discussed within.    Cyrus recently posted about DSR Initial values  This thread is open for feedback and discussion.    Signal Request: Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  This seems to have come to an end and will be moving on-chain soon. Rich: I posted a summary in that thread about the journey we went on to introduce exponential rate-stepping to the SF adjustments. The main takeaway is getting a sense of what we think is an adequate consensus. On Monday MKR token holders will have the opportunity to vote on the change from linear to exponential rate-stepping.     Should we change the stability fee poll cadence?  The community is having a similar discussion about the frequency of SF adjustment polls. Some are arguing for a two-week cadence. Currently(09/22/10) a poll up to determine whether there is consensus to change the cadence. It seems that it\u2019s 60/40 against changing the cadence, with 19 voters. More participation is needed to see if this is something the greater community wants.

We announced the impending launch date of MCD, Nov 18th. We have 5 G&R calls until then, so we have some work to do. What is MCD all about?  It\u2019s a big deal for everyone, for many reasons. MCD symbolizes the fact that MakerDAO is now open for business. Up until this point, SCD has been a proof-of-concept. This protocol has huge aspirations, and MCD is the beginning of the real road to fulfilling these aspirations. On a global stage, SCD is tiny at 80MM Dai. MCD opens the door to scaling Dai to far larger numbers. It allows the big partners to begin to engage with the system as well. Besides new collateral, other new important mechanisms will be in place as well. The SF, for example, will be accrued on a continuous basis instead of the discrete way SFs are collected today in SCD. MCD will be building a portfolio of underlying assets, for the benefit of diversification to de-risk the system as a whole. The DSR is another wonderfully important feature. We\u2019re altering the base-layer of DeFi. We\u2019ll see a currency that has earning built into it. This will be a significant paradigm shift. It is a decentralized savings account for anyone, including dapps. The integration team is hard at work, getting everyone on the same page about the coming migration. New security modules will be present in MCD: the Governance Security Module, Emergency Security Module, and the Oracle Security Module.   Up until this point, we\u2019ve been managing a single universe. Managing the Dai peg through SF adjustments and working to improve the governance process in general. In the next four weeks, we will begin to have two universes. The SCD universe, and the MCD universe. So we will need to start answering some questions very rapidly.  How long is the Governance ecosystem willing to support both universes? How much overhead can we handle as a governing community? How do we ensure the stability of these two universes? How do we remain agile and responsive enough to handle these challenges? How do we establish processes on managing the other new variables in MCD?   You can consider the CDP engine and the Dai token itself as part of the core functioning of the DeFi space. Therefore we need to handle these with utmost care. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   Cyrus Risk & Migration 14:26   From a newcomer perspective, it\u2019s relatively straightforward. New users in the DeFi system will likely start out with MCD Dai. Though there is this big question on current Sai users and CDP users as well. From the start, we will cover what the lifecycle of SCD is, and what are the details around Global Settlement.  These are decisions for the community to think about. Ultimately, MKR holders are responsible for the safeguarding of the userbase. Our goal should be to manage the users in a way that would avoid forcing anyone\u2019s hand, which would reduce friction and risk as much as possible. The job of the risk team is to consider all the proposals for how to handle these questions.   If the community wants to keep SCD alive, that is their right. Though there are ways to keep a version of SCD, called PurityDai, housed under the MCD technology stack. Migration can\u2019t be forced upon anybody. We should come to a plan on what to do sooner rather than later. Migration  Two primary stakeholders: Sai holders & CDP owners. From this point going forward we will be referring to SCD Dai as Sai, and MCD Dai as Dai. The goal is to migrate both to the new system seamlessly. There are some risks involved. There are three or four things to be aware of and plan for. The community needs to be on the same page on this. Migration is a business-centric decision rather than a risk one. Essentially, we have roughly 85MM Sai. If we want to migrate all that over to MCD that will be a massive supply shock. One of the great things about Sai is that it\u2019s been around for two years, there\u2019s great liquidity and many integration partners. Dai will not have that same level at launch, though it will have a lot due to the efforts of our integrations team and partners. Because of that, there are ways that this can go less than ideal. For example, a naive way of doing the migration is telling Sai holders to sell Sai on the open market to buy Dai. This would cause a lot of slippage and volatility. Depending on how quickly everyone would want to migrate over, it\u2019s a risk that we might see some market chaos if not appropriately planned for. Thankfully our engineers have been thinking about this for a long time, and they have created a \u201cMigration Contract.\u201d We haven\u2019t gotten much feedback about this, so I assume most people just haven\u2019t read through it. Read about it here  Essentially the migration contract will be a special CDP that takes Sai as collateral and issues Dai. Alongside a mechanic for converting a sCDP to an mCDP using the collateral Sai in the Migration CDP.  There needs to be Sai in the deposit contract for CDPs to migrate. There is also the issue of the SF that needs to be paid off first for CDP owners. The migration contract checks your wallet for sufficient MKR to close out your CDPs SF fee. The integrations team is also open-sourcing an arbitrage bot that can run of DEXs for MKR to help with liquidity. Our Prop Trading Desk will be adding MKR liquidity to facilitate the influx of MKR demand for SF payments.     We will need to worry about monetary policy for both Sai and Dai pegs. We should be prepared to be agile. An important question is the level of delegation to the risk team that the governance community is comfortable with. There are so many positive aspects of upgrading, so our expectation is that the default case will run smoothly. We should discuss and define edge cases in order to establish contingency plans. The last thing I want to talk about is how the migration governance cycle plays into the more standard risk framework we\u2019ve been building out for MCD collateral onboarding.  Given the immense supply shock of the migration, any concept of risk premiums takes a back-seat. Ensuring the stability of the peg is the primary concern. In this case, it doesn\u2019t matter if the asset is something super safe or risky. The fact that we are bringing in a potentially large amount of Dai at inception will bring a certain amount of necessary care to Governance. My expectation is that starting in the new year, we will start to work on more proper risk and governance cycles.   What the migration risk parameters might be is still an open question that we will revisit next week. There are multiple ways to do this. It becomes an operational question of what we are trying to optimize for. My guess is that we will put out a proposal that optimizes for minimal disruption. I am certainly interested to hear if people think there are other considerations we should be factoring in.  Questions   19:37: How does passing a Global Settlement work in terms of voting?  The general idea is that the community would trigger GS by passing a Governance poll and then an Executive vote.    32:44: You mentioned that there needs to be Sai in the contract for CDPs to be able to migrate. So there is a dependency on Sai holders to migrate for CDP owners to migrate, Correct?  To be clear, people don\u2019t need to use the migration contract. They can migrate over manually if they choose. That being said, Yes, that dependency exists. We have a few large Sai holding partners that have pledged to migrate initially in order to provide the liquidity necessary for CDP owners to migrate to MCD.    34:55: Do you imagine any amount of Sai price disruption?  Essentially the risk is that we need to build consensus in the community on how we want to do it. Though one idea is to have the DSR positioned in a way that would ensure Sai liquidity to be there prior to CDP owners wanting to move over. I don\u2019t anticipate liquidity issues there. There will be Sai to Dai conversion as well as Dai to Sai, so this will help with the peg-to-peg price difference.    01:09:34: Why are any active measures necessary to push people to MCD? Shouldn\u2019t the market eventually converge to MCD if it\u2019s better than SCD?  Cyrus: The answer has to do with MKR holders, and their prerogative to manage the entire MakerDAO ecosystem in a way that they think is best for all stakeholders, both from a  risk perspective and a growth perspective. Rich: What does converge actually mean? I think the community needs to come to a conclusion about what is the way to define a completed lifecycle of SCD. Cyrus: What\u2019s interesting is that this question is a re-phrasing of \u201cWhy MCD?\u201d anyway. It brings us back to the general benefits of MCD and why it is better than SCD and why people should migrate over anyway.    01:13:15: What are the things we will be covering in the coming G&R calls?  Next week: discuss potential hard parameter estimates for MCD. Risk parameters not only for ETH but for the special Sai CDP, as well as the BAT token CDP. Next week we might put out a plan for good risk parameters with the objective of a safe migration. The week after that: Parameters around the auction parameters for the 3 auction types. The week after that: Governance Security Module parameters Final call before launch: Final wrap-up stuff. Rich: in the midst of all these, we will be having polls and discussions that will lead up to the launch.    01:16:40: When will the MCD whitepaper be ready?  It will likely be an updated version of the current whitepaper. Rune has been working on it. When it will be ready, I am not sure. Noone in the foundation is really waiting for it. We have a lot of specific technical documentation out about various specifics of the system. Cyrus: Is this more than a nice-to-have? How strongly does the community feel about the whitepaper? (Given that we have a ton of specific and granular documentation.)    01:20:27: Can the MCD code change after audit reports publication?  The whitepaper wouldn\u2019t imply code-freeze, but rather functionality freeze. As we are progressing through the security roadmap, processing the results of the audits we\u2019ve done, we are still changing minor details as we are moving closer to launch. There might be small detail changes that will be added or improved. You can always see what we\u2019ve done in recent releases here: Changes to MCD code  The changes are minimal and specific to the last improvements before launching the system. They wouldn\u2019t require a full re-audit of the code due to how minimal and specific they are.    01:23:13: Formal verification status update?  Core contracts are formally verified. Outside of that, particularly the CDP manager contract is something we are working to formally verify. The ones that aren\u2019t formally verified are typically dependent on larger codebases that aren\u2019t formally verified themselves. DS-Chief is an example of this. For DS-Chief to be formally verified, all of the SCD code would need to be formally verified first, which is not feasible. Security Roadmap is an ongoing effort; The bug bounty has no end-date. As we add new modules into the system, unless they are optional, we will be running them through our high standards for code security. It will be up to the community to enforce the standards.    01:26:55: DS-chief status for both systems. Will it be one to connect governance for both systems?  To start, it will be the same Ds-chief used between both systems. We hope in the future to introduce a formally verified DS-Chief in the future. This implies a complete rewrite of this contract. MKR holders will be able to use one voting contract to vote on both SCD & MCD. Voters will continue to use a single dashboard.

P4CKcU1.jpg1679\u00d7881 142 KB    Questions to Vishesh  Any guidance on rate adjustment?  Given the quietness in the metrics, I don\u2019t have a clear recommendation.   We see the VWAP graphs that Sai is trading slightly above $1. I don\u2019t understand what the motivation is to optimize for a very exact peg. Are people naturally trying to create symmetry around the Dai target price?  As simple as we want to make these things, they are more complex than we think. If Sai trades consistently above a dollar, groups like Market Makers are actually encouraged by this kind of trading activity. It should improve the willingness of OTC players to take bets on Sai when it is below a dollar.    General LongForWisdom Forum Activity Recap 01:00:34   Governance at a Glance Thread Generally, the forums have been relatively quiet. There have been some discussions around the collateral applications. The main thing I want to bring up is the Signal Request thread on increasing the SCD debt ceiling. The poll finished last week.  It\u2019s interesting since there is a divergence in the options. The winning option being a commitment to do maintenance around the debt ceiling instead of a single unilateral decision to raise the Debt Ceiling. Rich: Is this something we still feel strongly about in light of the coming migration? Cyrus has already made the point a few times that we don\u2019t know how long these two systems will coexist. However, presumably, the Sai supply should be dropping overtime after the migration. Cyrus: This is why we want some signal and consensus from the community. If our goals are aligned, it might be worth incrementally decreasing the debt ceiling for the sake of a safer migration strategy. LFW: The wording of the poll was specific to pre-MCD. We would need to repoll post MCD launch.    Links from the Chat  PurityDai Thread Upgrading to Multi-Collateral Dai Guide  ",

I am the head of Community development and also currently the only Governance Facilitator(GF) but not for long! We\u2019ll talk about that today.   Our agenda includes a great deal to go over as we transition our world from old to new: the monetary policy from the old world and digging into MIPs here in the new world. As we refine the process, LongForWisdom will be telling us about Governance at a Glance. A MIPs process update with Charles and what that transition from the old world to the new world looks like. LFW will review two MIPs he submitted. Cyrus will give us a recap from last week about TUSD. Lucas from Centrifuge will provide us with a review of their two MIPs, one for console freight and one for paperchain. We are jam-packed today. I\u2019m going to likely tap on people\u2019s shoulders to keep time rolling.  I forgot some of my MIPS responsibilities to take care of today. As we start to figure out what the points of order are, how to formalize this, where the speeches go, and when the gavels get banged (this is going to be somewhat shambolic so, apologies)    Today we\u2019re in week two of the MIPs process, the light MIPs process. As Governance Facilitator, it\u2019s my responsibility to review the inclusion polls from the previous week as a sort of \u201cmock-UN review\u201d of the MIPs process, the only MIP that we have in play is the inclusion of another governance facilitator. We had a poll to determine the community\u2019s appetite for onboarding LongForWisdom. This is an interesting poll for a few reasons.  One exciting aspect is the default inclusion threshold, which is a development we need to internalize. A certain amount of participation is required for a poll to go through. In this poll, the default threshold for a satisfactory yes, or signal that consensus was achieved, was 3k MKR. Happily, it should have ended, and good news! LFW will be officially included in this next week\u2019s Governance Poll. If you want to offer him your congratulations with a whopping 93.42% support for his ratification, please do. BUT! Someone voted \u2018no\u2019 with 400MKR. A few days ago, I went to the portal to signal support for Long. I thought to myself, how amusing, I was going to vote \u2018no\u2019 myself, just to see what would happen. But someone beat me to it. Whoever you are, you\u2019re a jerk, but there\u2019s Governance in action .    Take it away Long. You\u2019re halfway there.   Main Theme LongForWisdom Governance At a Glance 05:07   PAXG PAX-Gold as MCD collateral   @befitsandpiper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of PaxGold as collateral for MCD.   Still no collateral application from PAXG.     Discussion Thread: Use synthetics for collateral to avoid centralization risks   @latetot asks for opinions on using synthetics as collateral in the Maker Protocol; the discussion touches on Synthetix and synths in general.    The Target Rate Feedback Mechanism: An Introduction  Kurt gives a brief overview of the TRFM (target rate feedback mechanism) as well as the benefits and downsides of implementing it in the Maker Protocol.    Revisiting GSM Delay & Dark Spell Social Layer Discussion  Will proposes producing an initial policy document for use in case a dark-spell is necessary before Governance can determine a more durable, long term policy.    Seeking Signal   Nothing new this week   Adjust wBTC Debt Ceiling  The vote concluded with a no.    Change the Stability Fee Structure  Rich: Lots to debate here, so we\u2019ll carve out some time next week for this topic.    Maker Improvement Proposals Charles St. Louis Week Two Update 09:03   I\u2019d like to go over the same structure as I did last week in the Governance call. Provide a little more detail on this week\u2019s activity in the current Governance cycle, what\u2019s up next week, and what we expect for the fourth week. I\u2019ll also talk about a few more updates concerning the MIPs process and collateral onboarding in general.   I\u2019ll be posting this update on the forum as a thread like I did earlier this week. Hopefully, you can get it tomorrow instead of next Monday, so people can read about it earlier on.   Inclusion Poll   Earlier today, the inclusion poll for core personnel onboarding of LFW as Governance Facilitator passed. The results were 5,529MKR to 403MKR, plus the default inclusion threshold of 3k MKR. Yes, votes were higher than both, so the proposal passed.   On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll review the results of the inclusion poll: next step is the Governance Poll that we will have next Monday. With respect to next week on Monday, we\u2019ll have the Governance polls submitted by the GF. It will run for three days. In general, the governance poll\u2019s purpose is to determine if this sub-proposal to add LFW as Governance Facilitator should proceed to the final Executive vote. Ultimately putting it up for acceptance or rejection. If it passes, it will go to the Executive Vote.   On that Thursday of next week, the GF will do another review, similar to this week. Talking about results and making sure we can proceed to the next step. We\u2019ll acknowledge that the final vote will be ready in week 4.   In terms of week 4, the executive vote will be submitted on a Monday. It will have an expiration of 4 days. Then it will have no effects. MIPS and sub proposals only move to accepted if the vote is passed within that 4-day limit. If it fails to pass in that windows, the MIP is changed to the rejected status.   Collateral Onboarding   In week four, we have the Community Greenlight Poll (CGP) to get direction about what to do next with the MIP 6 applications that have been proposed in the Forums. The CGP will be posted on the 4th Monday at the same time as the Executive Vote for Long\u2019s sub-proposal. It will run until Friday.   On Thursday of week four, the GFs do a Governance Cycle review for this meeting, which gives the opportunity to discuss the past Governance cycle and everything that happened throughout. As well as discuss any potential upcoming Governance cycle and submissions for the next month.   In terms of overall collateral onboarding, I\u2019d like to reemphasize that we are in transition from the current collateral onboarding practices that we know to the MIPs process.   During this period, we\u2019ll use the weekly cycle format that we\u2019ve been using for this month.  Given that the results of the CGP end on week 4 of this month, May 28th, the MIP 12 proposals with the Domain teams work for those collateral assets will likely not be ready for the June\u2019s Governance cycle. This means the Domain teams will have to determine which assets they will work on, from both the poll and their own judgment. They\u2019ll work on the deliverables over the course of June; then, the proposals will likely be ready to enter the Governance Cycle in July.    That\u2019s my update. I\u2019ll post it as a government thread in the governance category.   Questions and Comments 2 13:29   Rich: Thanks, Charles, for the recap. One of the main takeaways is that MIPs will be an enormously useful tool in the arsenal. But it will take some muscle memory to get it fully internalized. So as we plow through this month looking forward to having more integrations next month. Speaking of, one of our secret champions of the MIPs process is up next.   LFW: Before we do that, Lucas asked about when the first domain team greenlights will be published on the collateral applications. I believe the first ones have already been started, and I think Nik put something up from the oracle team. The deadline is supposed to be Friday (AKA tomorrow). Hoping to see a rush of them happen at the end.   Rich: The primary issue, and I love this since I get to do callbacks to themes in previous meetings, is the path from intention to implementation. Understanding what the MIPs process entails, especially all of its individual pieces required in order to put them into play. Additionally, dealing with the level of work we have on our plates.   Rich: There are numerous themes. One is pure bandwidth. The MIPs process has published a best-case scenario for the preferred path to onboard collateral types. One of the frictions that we have run into is the volume of work we encountered with onboarding these collateral types. The coordination across stakeholders and domain teams need to provide analysis for each application.   Rich: Coordinating all of that work is not an insignificant task. We\u2019re working on it internally, how to communicate it back to the MIPs applicants, and we\u2019re not there yet. When will we be there? I\u2019m not entirely sure yet. Hopefully, this week, or next week, and we can start digging into the application process. My expectation is that there will be some meetings involved, sort of like a Q&A session between the domain teams and the MIPs applicants, so we can establish some baselines to understand all of the moving pieces. As an example, when we did wBTC internally, that\u2019s something potentially to be expected; it\u2019s a well-known project in the ecosystem. It still took a fantastic amount of detailed work across several departments at Maker to make that happen. I\u2019m sorry, Lucas I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not satisfying, but we will reach out to you to work with you and other MIPs applicants.   LFW: It\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re not talking about the greenlights here yet.   Rich: For sure, it\u2019s even more complicated. Nik is sounding off in the chat and Cyrus; maybe you can add some color to the greenlights?   Cyrus: I think that you have covered the bandwidth issue pretty well, we\u2019re trying to work through everything as fast as we can, but it\u2019s a new process. If anyone has questions, definitely reach out.     LongForWisdom Declarations of Intent and Protocol DAI Transfer 19:42  I posted a couple of MIPs in the forum early in the week. They don\u2019t have numbers yet(now they do) because the MIPs editor assigns the numbers.  MIP 14 Protocol DAI Transfer 20:00 Forum Thread for MIP14   Protocol DAI Transfer defines a process that allows Governance to transfer DAI to an Ethereum address.   There are uncomplicated requirements. There are no onerous requirements. If you can get MIP sub proposal through this process, it will be added to an executive vote with a call to the suck function, which allows Governance to pull Dai out of the protocol and send it to an address.   I wrote this to be a very generic low-level thing we could use, in the case where we don\u2019t have a more specific, detailed process. For example, we want to build more complex solutions in the future for treasury management and paying people. But for now, we can fall back onto this.   Questions and Comments 3 21:50   Rich: There will be questions, though I think it hasn\u2019t just set in yet. This is the first example where the community can self-fund for activities.  LFW: Eventually, yes. The idea is any reason that Dai needs to be sent; the process can be covered by this proposal.    Rich: One of the questions is guardrails: How do we protect the protocol from bad actors? What social layer would we need to vet/verify these actions or even manage those funds in transit? The questions could be endless, but the intention behind the MIP is compelling. The Foundation\u2019s responsibility is to bootstrap the protocol. We do that in different ways; by creating reference implementations in software or by facilitating different roles in the ecosystem until they become self-sustaining. Ultimately, there\u2019s no true autonomy in that model unless empowered actors have access to their own funding sources. Having a mechanism like this in place changes the fundamental landscape of how Governance works. I encourage people to take a good look at this one.   LFW: It will be up to Governance to properly vet sub proposals. The onus is on the creator of the sub-proposal to provide a reason why their funding request is necessary.   Charles: I want to add that these proposals are very fresh, and most haven\u2019t read through them. There\u2019s no need to fully agree now; the intention is to introduce them and move the discussion to the forums. There\u2019s no need to have full commentary now.     25:00   Cryptowanderer: I have one small comment, I think is worth mentioning. An executive, already in week four, to add you as GF needing 60K MKR within four days is a steep hill to climb. We need to think about a more efficient way to deal with these \u201cprocess MIPs\u201d that don\u2019t have a codebase change and might not have to go all the way to on-chain voting to ratify. It\u2019s a complicated question, but our ratifying process for MIPs without executive votes, so that we don\u2019t end up in a situation where an executive vote happening early in the week that will have difficulty getting passed. Ultimately I strongly encourage people to go to the forum and check the technical part particularly. Especially if \u201csucking\u201d Dai from the VAT immediately triggers FLOP auctions. Perhaps Kurt can help because if we\u2019re sucking and initiating FLOP auctions immediately, that could be a problem. If anyone can come up with a way of processing MIPs without going through the executive vote, that would be golden.   LFW: This is something we have been discussing lately. We don\u2019t necessarily need an executive vote to do non-technical MIPs. Staking MKR is slightly more durable than Polling. As written, non-technical MIPs need to go through the process, but if we do realize that this is not optimal, we might change it.   Crytowanderer: I\u2019m in favor of it ATM, but it\u2019s part of the process we can iterate and improve on in the long term. If you submit a MIP to improve the process, not only would that be Meta, it would be appreciated.   CSL: another point to consider is that if there were two different cycles for both technical and process MIPS, we would have to manage the additional complexity caused by the overlap between the cycles. But you are right, that a core principle about MIPs is that you can iterate over time, making amendments to them. If there is a lot of consensus in the community about changing this \u201cprocess versus technical MIPS\u201d life-cycle, it will eventually get voted in.   Lev: I think that there is a natural or canonical turnout requirement for executive votes since you have to overcome the previous hat. You don\u2019t have this with polls, where someone needs to make an arbitrary decision for the turnout requirement to make it valid. The executive votes have this conservative quality with a very high barrier. That\u2019s important to take into account when deciding on the process. If you do create a process MIP that goes up and passes with low turnout, someone could point to it later in the future as illegitimate. Since it could be examined as \u201cthis is ridiculous, it only had 1k MKR voting for it,\u201d or \u201cI never even see that poll.\u201d You could not argue that you have not seen an executive vote, as you could with a poll. You\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot passing process MIPS on lower turnout Governance polls.   Kurt: That\u2019s a good point, and maybe you could go even further and say that maybe for these process MIPS we should be, as part of the executive vote, putting a hash of the document we agreed to on-chain; so that there is an attestation on-chain.   lev: Absolutely agree about the attestation. That\u2019s currently, in my opinion, an issue with the Governance Poll process. I believe, in theory, it\u2019s possible to edit the wording of a Governance Poll. I don\u2019t know if it happened before or not. I assume that if the proposal has a typo or a small error, it could be edited. I\u2019m not aware of a process to check the wording at vote, this is a side problem, but Kurt\u2019s suggestion is great.   Rich: There\u2019s no shortage of things on our to-do list or things we could add. But as context, our polls go into GitHub. So there is an audit trail there to avoid ninja editing. It\u2019s not the best solution and isn\u2019t very decentralized. Wish list for me: I\u2019d prefer that this stuff go into IPFS and called directly from there. If the community would like to see that sooner rather than later, then it\u2019s something we could consider. Forum threads, perhaps? If someone wants to accelerate the process.     Declarations of Intent 32:36 Forum Thread for MIP13   This is a formalization of Governance declaring the intention to do something or act in a certain way. We\u2019ve seen this before, with signaling polls: the shutdown of SCD, ranked on-chain voting, compensation of vaults on BT, all have polls saying \u201cwe should do X.\u201d   It allows governance to set a bounty value on these declarations. For example, if we say we want ranked-on-chain polling, they could add, \u201cand we\u2019re willing to pay 50,000 Dai to the group facilitating this.\u201d This MIP is an example of a process that might use the protocol-Dai-Transfer idea. There are boilerplates of how to revoke, accept, or change these.  Rich: I can guarantee that there will be questions later. Thanks, LFW, for this proposal.    Collateral Onboarding Cyrus Younessi and Marko TUSD Collateral onboarding 35:14  We\u2019ll be redoing last week\u2019s presentation. We\u2019ll also discuss the option for a second USDC vault type, which has been discussed on the forums for the past few weeks. Might be an additional proposal added to the TUSD proposal later this month. I\u2019ll handoff to Marko for the TUSD presentation.  1058\u00d7556 44.6 KB  Our team prepared this analysis of true USD as a potential collateral asset for MakerDAO.

These have the ability to maintain closer to a hard peg.   Dai, which is a decentralized stablecoin backed by a surplus of underlying assets, maintains a soft peg.

For Nuo, not sure what is going on. On Aaavea, there is a bit more aggressive strategy than Compound. Nuo has a higher risk tolerance for collateral assets. Out of the 900k deposited in Aave, about 75% is deposited due to curve protocol. Curve protocol is a bit sophisticated, which indicates that only about 200k is deposited in Aave from everyday users who want stablecoin yield.  1058\u00d7577 83.2 KB  Same data presented as a market share.

Questions and Comments 4 58:44   Cyrus Younessi: Thanks for that awesome presentation. I\u2019ll post in the chat the link to the forum and the proposed risk parameters. We can open it up for questions or discussion. Proposed risk parameters: Stability Fee 0%, Debt Ceiling 2 million, Liquidation Ratio 120%.  I think the most fruitful discussion would be about the debt ceiling and its relation to other stablecoins in the system. Right now, the USDC debt ceiling is 20 million, and the idea is that we could put a cap on this class of stablecoins. If we were trying to put USDC in with a, say, 2 million dollar debt ceiling, then we can consider reducing USDC as well. Additionally, I\u2019d like to tie into the conversation a USDC-B vault for emergency liquidity purposes for auctions. I know this is a lot to take in, so I\u2019m happy to continue this in the forums as well.    01:00:31   Chris Padovano: Wasn\u2019t the recommendation that TUSD provides little diversification in terms of regulatory risk. It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone is going to mint Dai. Maybe there are better-centralized stablecoins that Governance should be focusing on, that people could be more excited amount?`   Cyrus Younessi: When we put proposals for parameters, governance is welcome to vote against it. I think we have reflected that lack of interest with a fairly low debt ceiling. I think 2 million is the lowest that has ever been proposed for a collateral type, almost like a bare minimum. If even that is too high, we should discuss this.   Chris Padovano: I thought this was a great presentation that showed that TUSD is fighting such an uphill battle. I was also surprised that PAX was around for so long. If we are going to pick another centralized stablecoin   CY: you could also use the wrapped bitcoin argument that maybe activity could pick up after addition to the protocol.   CP: With wrapped BTC, that actually did happen. Someone went out and minted a thousand wrapped BTC, and wrapped BTC is kind of a newer idea. I think we should focus on governance fatigue. We should really be making our shots count. Especially when we\u2019re talking about adding new collateral types that we are excited about. Your pitch really persuaded me, this doesn\u2019t seem, like no one seems excited about this I want to take the other side. I don\u2019t know.   SamM: Does it have to be either-or? Can\u2019t we just bring as much collateral as possible as long as it\u2019s not a complete scam, and control our exposure based on the debt ceiling?   CY: Exactly. And to be clear, I don\u2019t think that Marko or anyone from the risk team is trying to project an image of excitement or else. That is for Governance to decide. From the risk standpoint, I would be interested to hear if an even lower debt ceiling would make sense. At that point, I would say, \u201cprobably not.\u201d I think the primary argument that Chris is making is about adding to governance overhead. But I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s something that we can deal with at this time. But I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s something that we can deal with at this time, because the intention is that plenty more collateral will be coming through the system. It almost makes sense to learn how to deal with that sooner rather than later.   CP: Right, exactly. That\u2019s totally fair.   CY: If there comes a time when there\u2019s like 30 collateral types in the system will require some reworking on how we manage the portfolio. It\u2019s better to see that now with easy collateral types.   CP: Of course, yea, so I\u2019m persuaded.   RB: I\u2019m trying to stay aware of the time. We have a lot to go through, so Cyrus, can we please turn over to Lucas?   Cyrus Younessi: Yes. Please, let\u2019s continue this discussion either over forums or in the chat.     ",

Given the time, I\u2019ll brush over a lot of things and set the frame for a conversation, and hopefully, we can turn it into more of a discussion. Please refer to community calls, and forum threads, regarding the details about some of the technical aspects. I\u2019ll share more information later as well. Nevertheless, I think I need to give a little bit of background on what Centrigue is and what we do.  1069\u00d7582 89 KB   Centrifuge does decentralized asset finance for what some people call \u201creal-world assets.\u201d Allowing businesses to use real-world assets, such as invoices, (extended to real-estate or anything that you can borrow against). We enable asset originators who have these assets to tokenize them, bring them on-chain, and pool these portfolios of individual loans and issue an ERC20 token that allows investors to invest in these pools.   We have two asset originators in the MIP 6 proposal process:   Paperchain, best described as a streaming revenue analytics company that allows music labels to see how their music is performing on the different streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, Google, and so on. As part of their business, they want to offer these music companies/labels/artists the opportunity to advance part of the cash flow they\u2019re going to collect. So, you have an invoice where Spotify tells you that they will pay you a given amount in 60 days for your music. You want to go to a bank and borrow money on that invoice; this is typically called factoring.   ConsolFreight is a freight software technology provider that helps freight forwarders to break up shipments and coordinate shipping goods across the world. They have invoices by shippers from distributors, like supermarkets, that use them to organize their deliveries. The assets they are interested in bringing into MCD as collateral are these freight invoices. Regarding what stage they are at, ConsolFreight created its first securitization and initial 49 loans worth a total of 278,000 Dai and sold those to 10 different investors that now own an ERC20 token that is generating a yield on these invoices. As these invoices are paid back, the DROP token holders, as they call them, can redeem their token for Dai, which is principal plus interest.     1440\u00d7808 171 KB   Most abstractly, you can think of this system as individual loans that are represented by nonfungible tokens. We do not just issue one ERC20, but we also use what structured finance calls senior and junior tranches, where the DROP token is insured by the TIN token, meaning that you have two classes of investors. The TIN token investors get a potentially larger upside but take any losses first. The DROP token holders get a fixed interest lower rate and are insured by any losses based on TIN token percentage investment.  What we did with ConsolFreight, they had 278,000 Dai in loans. Of that, TIN tokens holders invested 28,000 Dai and Drop token holders invested the remaining 250,00 Dai. As long as the portfolio of invoices returns 250k + interest in Dai, Drop token holders will not see a loss. If they return 260,000, it means that the TIN token holders will face a significant loss. If they return anything more than the original investment, after the DROP token holders have been paid out, the TIN token holders get to see any money.    Why do this? The reason for having two different tokens is to have an asset that is much more stable and has some sort of insurance, which is the liquid and much more stable asset, the DROP token. The TIN token, or underwriter token, is the token the originator uses to have skin in the game.  In the instance of ConsolFreight, the TIN tokens are 50/50 Centrifuge and ConsolFreight itself, putting a small stake, guaranteeing the performance of this portfolio of loans.    Is this structure normal for receivables financing? The split structure is definitely used in all sorts of debt financing, even other kinds of financing. I think it makes sense for Maker and lenders that want to have a very stable asset. As an investor, you can now change your risk assessment from an individual asset in the portfolio going bankrupt or being at a loss and losing that fraction of the portfolio to a pool of assets and the losses surpassing what the TIN token holders have invested. So a Drop token holder, I have a much lower risk. That\u2019s how Centrifuge assets work.   1049\u00d7560 61 KB   I would like to talk in general about how real-world assets behave as collateral in Maker. I think it requires a lot of rethinking, and I had way too little time to highlight many of the points in detail.   I\u2019ll start with the positive things: ConsolFreight or Paperchain have a known demand for capital. We just talked about how much TUSD or BAT is used to generate Dai. It\u2019s a very different use case for me as a BAT token holder for me to say: I want to margin trade or use that BAT as collateral to get some security or get some safety by borrowing Dai. The difference is that an asset originator will go to the market, sell the Dai, give the Fiat to freight forwarders or to the music labels, and then use that as one of their main source of capital.   Another thing is that in the current market climate, a lot of these crypto-assets right now are not generating a lot of yields. These DROP tokens can generate yield because these are real loans to real businesses that have the cost of capital if they go into traditional financial markets, and we can capture that in the DeFi ecosystem instead.   One other thing that is oftentimes criticized when looking at real-world assets in Maker is that all of these assets are not truly decentralized. They aren\u2019t, and they rely on a legal framework. But one opportunity that we have here is that if we diversify and start onboarding different kinds of real-world assets with different kinds of originators and different legal restrictions, that is something that can add to the diversity of the portfolio and make Maker a more secure system.   One of the key questions we have to ask is, \u201cis MCD the primary or secondary market for these assets?\u201d With Paperchain, and ConsolFreight, directly petitioning the Maker community for inclusion of the assets, Maker has the chance to be the primary lender. Meaning that the asset originator deposits DROP as collateral and gets Dai directly from the Maker Protocol. For that to work, however, we must understand that in supply chain finance, you very often see advance rates of 90% or even 95%. What that means for Maker is we have to start being much more comfortable with pricing assets and giving it risk parameters that reflect this and can compete with this real-world asset class.   Another thing of what Centrifuge has focused on, when thinking about these real-world assets, is short-term debt. That means trade finance assets are a really interesting category because if you have a loan that\u2019s due in 120 days, it\u2019s much easier to price it just because the macro-economic circumstances don\u2019t change quite as much over those 120 days. You have a much higher turnover, and you have faster feedback to see how this works. What this still means is that these assets, by crypto standards, very illiquid. There is no instant market for freight invoices that we can tap into and use as price oracles. The credit industry in the traditional financial world use pricing models that factor in credit risk by different lenders and arrive at a net asset value of a portfolio that doesn\u2019t rely on price discovery in the market but rather an agreed-upon model. As the Maker community, we have to start thinking if that is something that we want to incorporate, or do we want to insist on there being a market? How do we feed prices to oracles when we know that the price of an invoice doesn\u2019t change for the most part of the time it is active? Maybe it changes once it goes into default?   Lastly, keepers are something that I want to start discussing. The kind of keepers that will have to be brought into MCD are different. They exist in the real world: they are distressed debt buyers that specialize in buying under-performing pools of loans. Different collection agencies buy individual assets. We\u2019ll have to bring those entities to the table and start including them in these discussions that we\u2019re having. I want to start a dialogue around these topics. We\u2019ve been hosting calls that we open up with whoever wants to discuss. We can form working groups. I\u2019m open to working with Domain teams. I would open it up for questions, but I don\u2019t know how much time we have left.   Questions and Comments 5 01:24:17   Lucas Vogelsang: Centrifuge has been hosting their own calls. We sometimes announce on the Maker forum, and we have done what we call an \u201cOpen Collateral Onboarding Call\u201d that we plan on doing every two weeks. The last one happened last Wednesday; I think we\u2019ll do another one this coming Wednesday. Happy to take the conversation there if people are interested.   Lucas Vogelsang: the question I would like to get feedback on is, \"Do you think that Maker should offer a lending product? Should MCD be the primary lender for these assets? That is a question that will come up, because asset originators will want to borrow directly, and Maker has a very interesting proposition for them. They can borrow instant money with a flexibility that you can\u2019t find anywhere in the traditional financial ecosystem. But if you start opening up to real-world assets, you cannot just rely on a price feed that comes from a couple of exchanges anymore for telling MCD how to treat these vaults.   01:26:04   Helge Qvan: I usually go by the name PlanetX. Your proposal is fantastically interesting. I do struggle a bit with the pricing of the collateral. I know you have said that this is very stable collateral, but we have to know how to sell this if the vault ever goes under. As far as I understand, you rely on the manual evaluation of the collateral. Is that correct?   LV: When you think about our ERC20 tokens, they\u2019re a fraction of a portfolio of loans. These loans are legal documents that we bring on-chain as NFTs priced and underwritten by as many diversified oracles or attesters as you can think of. So this NFT might be attested by a financial auditing firm to say that the paperwork is correct. You could try to get a fraud scoring company to rate the likelihood of fraud on that counterparty. If there\u2019s credit scoring information on these different assets, you could read out what the score is this individual lender. This will give you a risk rating on the particular asset. Which Tinlake, our contracts, will use to determine what the interest rate and the advance rate for this asset is. So at that point, we have a price for this asset. Then we calculate the NAV of the portfolio, which looks at these invoices, calculates the expected cash flows and the probability of default, and comes up with a number of what this asset should be valued at in the book. This is no different from what a credit fund would do today to assess its own portfolio.  We\u2019re giving this price to DROP and TIN investors to invest in these pools. That is what we would want to try to put that value of the DROP into MCD.   PlanetX: so far, I\u2019m with you. Could you explain what Maker will need to do to sell collateral?   LV: Keepers will have to bid on it, that\u2019s no different.   PlanetX: So, this would need to be a manual process?   Lucas: No, it wouldn\u2019t. There should be different keepers because you\u2019re not a keeper that wants to buy ETH and sell it on the next exchange for a small gain. You will obtain security that is a fraction of a set of invoices.   PlanetX: For crypto purposes, this market needs to be set up from scratch?   LV: Yes, the appropriate parties would require onboarding. We had these first investors invest in DROP that ConsolFreight issued. Anyone could bid on them. There would be some small differences with your average keeper since it moves much slower. Maybe a 6-hour auction window would not be enough, but at the same time, they\u2019re a lot more stable.     01:31:44   LFW: Regarding the vaults, is Centrifuge going to make one giant vault or lots of different vaults? If we have to liquidate, would it be one giant vault or several vaults? And the general case seems to be that the Drop token shouldn\u2019t take large hits. What incentives are going to be for keepers to stay around in the general case?   LV: Your comment in the chat, you said, \"I think this is more like warehouse financing than margin lending; there are differences in how Maker would need to handle it. I think the theme is an interesting one. To get back to what you were saying, \u201cIs Maker in the secondary or primary market?\u201d I think the opportunity to offer a credit product to these asset originators in the primary market is exciting. But that does mean that yes, the asset originator will create one giant vault for the category of DROP and collateralize that with their DROP and then start drawing Dai from it. There wouldn\u2019t be different vault holders that use different collateralization ratios that might get liquidated at different times. The entire asset pool would behave very similarly. You could look at it as one position on the balance sheet or one item of collateral. It should be much more stable. The price would be slower moving. You would not have these movements of what we\u2019ve seen today, with ETH margin trading. As long as these assets are performing as expected, liquidation should be an improbable scenario. Just to give you an idea, in B2B invoice spend, the default rate of these assets, depending on the industry, is less than 1%. If you look at credit funds for factoring, they have a fraud risk that\u2019s probably the biggest, but these assets rarely have these crashes that we see in crypto. The question on how do we get keepers to stick around, we need to integrate everyone and make them familiar with the system and move slowly.   LFW: My question was more: is there one big vault and one day everything falls apart, or have several ones that are being liquidated. If there\u2019s only one vault where it\u2019s all or nothing, would keepers stick around in the chance that everything falls apart one day? With the current system, you have different vaults with different liquidation ratios. With this, you\u2019re asking people to stick around for this 1 in 100 cases.   LV: Well, you would have a few days to liquidate this portfolio, not minutes. Keepers have a different kind of time span that they\u2019re working on. They are not trying to offload your asset as soon as possible in the next exchange to get more liquidity.   LFW: So we would be in a situation where we want something like a 20-day liquidation process where you source keepers where they get liquidated?   LV: I think that might make a lot of sense.   CP: Or you could put the obligation on the issuer to contract keepers to liquidate their collateral. There\u2019s a lot of contracts flying around, right? That could just be seen as an obligation for real-world asset collateral. One of the burdens of proof should be, \u201cwe\u2019re going to make sure that there are people around to buy this ship when it goes underwater.\u201d     01:37:54   Guilherme Remor: In terms of these initial businesses, Paperchain and ConsolFreight? How old are they?   LV: I think Alejandro is on the call, maybe you can talk about ConsolFreight. PaperChain has been there for over a year now. Actually, the Maker Foundation did a first pilot transaction where we went through this entire process of bringing an asset on-chain, securitizing the collateral, and selling it. At that point, MCD wasn\u2019t live yet, and none of this was done in MakerDAO. But we went through this legal side and part of the on-chain. I think this was last August if I remember correctly. PaperChain has been around for one and a half years.   GR: And I imagine that over that time for the business to be maintained, they have built some history with other lenders?   LV: I think Paperchain and ConsolFreight both want to use Maker as one of their first backers. ConsolFreight has gone live last week with its first set of assets. Paperchain has a track record of working with labels offering them analytics products but does not provide financial products outside of it.     1:39:54   Alejandro Gutierrez (ConsolFreight): We\u2019re a company established in 2016, started in logistics and moved into supply chain finance. We have been exploring other avenues to get funding. We have explored similar possibilities with some American companies before the COVID19 situation, but our eyes are now focused on the crypto space and especially with Maker.   LV: I want to emphasize what Kurt just said \u201cthat collateral can be anything that has value. I think the real dichotomy is commodity-backed versus debt-backed and how we see Maker\u2019s place in financing these assets.\u201d We\u2019re able to cut out a slew of intermediaries and established parties in the financial system that we see today by being a primary purchaser of debt if you want to call it that or compare to that. I think that\u2019s the opportunity we have to generate an interesting yield on relatively stable assets. There are definitely downsides that come from not just working with highly liquid assets. The upside is that we have yield and a whole set of US dollar stable assets that can bring stability to the system at times where crypto is not stable and sort of balance things out.   GR: Because of the nature of the issuance of short-term debt as you\u2019re mentioning, are you mostly thinking about use cases involving short-maturity trade financing through factoring or any other use cases that we should be considering.   LV: In the current economic climate, we want to focus on safer bets that are easier to price. One of the advantages of focusing on trade finance assets is that this is money that has been already spent by the business, it\u2019s just waiting for payment. Of course, this money is used to grow the business, but you\u2019re not borrowing against the expectation that the company will have long-term success and growth in revenue.   GR: And in terms of maturity that you would issue, you don\u2019t expect long timelines? As far as I currently see in the risk parameters we now have in the Maker ecosystem. Usually, there\u2019s no maturity to the debt that we have in the ecosystem, so that would be a change as well.   LV: We\u2019re reaching the time limit, Charles is asking to move this to the mips channel on RocketChat. We are going to have a call next Wednesday, at 19:30 European time, that\u2019s 10:30 Pacific time and 17:30 UTC where we can discuss this as well. Also a discussion on the MIPs proposals. I\u2019ll post the slides and some of the links in the RocketChat governance channel. Thanks for the time.

This is not a governance committee, we don\u2019t decide things on this call. This where we debate things, talk about trends, clear up misconceptions, present analytics, and so on. We have a new forum that was long overdue. It\u2019s turning out great, there\u2019s a ton of activity going on. I want to talk about emergent processes and workflows in the community:  Important questions to think about: How do we surface valuable information? How do we collect this information? Where does this information live? Calls are good, but the conversations aren\u2019t easily referenceable and the info isn\u2019t as comprehensive as it could be in writing. Other mediums are better. The chats and forums have the meat of the conversations. However, the chats are temporal while the forum has better visibility over time. The next place to make materials more canonical is importing them into the MakerDAO community GitHub. The details of that will be hashed out through a thread that will be posted soon on the forum.    01:01:15: Discussion about Debt Ceiling and seeking consensus to change the Gov poll in the coming weeks for a Debt Ceiling vote.

Governance decided not to wait, increasing the SF to 18.5%. 24 VWAP is consistently below $1 (at $0.98 level), with increased volume generally. The ETH price for the majority of June was going up, and at the tail end took a hit. Dai price did almost the same, it was steady and dropped with ETH.  Dai Supply: 01:18:15   We saw supply increase despite the increased Stability Fee. We leveled out around 91.3MM so far. More Dai is being drawn from new CDPs rather than old this month, which makes sense.  01:22:30: Excess supply graph is the amount of Dai not being borrowed on secondary lending platforms. Excess supply has increased since late June.  Age of Debt: 01:29:28   The age of open debt has consistently decreased, while closed debt has maintained steady. This means that while new debt is being created, older debt is maintaining the same average open days.  Collateralization Ratio: 01:20:13   When we see the collateralization ratio move down with ETH it tends to cause users to top up their CDPs, this is why the move downward seems muted. Conversely, when ETH goes up users are not too quick to pull collateral out of their CDPs in anticipation of a correction.  Secondary Lending Platforms: 01:21:42   WABR has been hovering below the Stability Fee, in a very tight spread. Supply volume has outpaced borrow volume. When SF or other policy changes happen, we need to wait some time before we see the effects.  Other  We reached 360MM total loans originated to date.  01:23:50: Graph of the Utilization Rate of Dai. Meant to try to see whether there is a relationship between rates on SLPs and the Stability Fee. Dai txs even outside of trading volume have picked up a lot. They\u2019ve outpaced trading volume of Dai. There were some liquidations with this latest price drop, but overall they were not huge compared to past drop offs.

Over time the topics of the conversation change based on what is currently most important. We won\u2019t always be talking about purely Risk, like in the past. We will aim some of the conversation today towards Governance.  Governance is not a solved problem. MakerDAO is on the leading edge for solving Governance issues like: How do we organize lots of people around the world? How do we organize when the stakes are high? What do the mechanisms and processes look like? How do we gather signal? We will be pursuing this in earnest because MCD is coming. When MCD launches depends on two factors. One is the mechanics, the code, audits, etc. The second is Governance and the community. We have a lot to do in the Governance and Risk Community. We need to optimize this process as much as we can.   Decision making does not happen in these calls. The venue is too restrictive. We hope the decisions will be made on the forum itself. We are already beginning to see this happening. To bridge what\u2019s happening on the forum with the listeners and participants of this call, David is going to do a Recap. Give us feedback about the call. DISCUSSION HAPPENS IN THE FORUM   David: Forum Activity Recap 07:54   Governance at a Glance Thread  Meta Governance: Signal Requests  Uses polls in the forum to establish governance community consensus on various open questions. 13 votes 100% agreed to use forum polls for temporary soft consensus. Concerns about non-MKR holders voting in these polls. Hopefully, a better solution emerges soon.    Signal Request/ Should we modify the SF voting cadence and stepping?  Consensus forming around biweekly cadence for SF changes as evidenced by both a poll in the comments of this thread (79%/21% in favor, 16 votes) & also as seen in discussions on RocketChat. Hard to say if there\u2019s \u201creal\u201d consensus here. Vishesh makes a good point arguing for a biweekly cadence for the SF, in that reacting too quickly to the Dai price may not give enough time for the effects of the previous changes to be seen.    Signal request/ Poll: Define standard stability fee changes based on recent price of DAI  There is a lot of pushback in this thread. Open questions still exist about the parameters: VWAP? 1 day? 3 days? 7 days? What\u2019s the lag time for effects to kick in? Not a lot of strong consensus.    Signal Request/ Should we move to exponential rate stepping for stability fee polls?  Saw positive support (16 votes total, 75%/25% in favor)    Ongoing Initiative/ Meta: Coordinating Collateral Due Diligence  Call to action for community members to do Due Diligence on Collateral in the onboarding process. 27 votes in the poll volunteering to do the work. Cyrus said to wait on this since a lot of due diligence is being handled by integrations and risk team internally. More info rolling out about this in the next couple of weeks.    Ongoing Initiative/ Systemic Risk Directory  This thread puts a poll to unique risks and seeks a signal about our concern for each. It also links the discussion thread for each listed risk.    Ongoing Initiative/ Estimating DAI/USD from the eth2dai order book instead of dex trades  Fascinating analysis. Curious to hear discussion about this method of collecting Dai price. This method would eliminate the VWAP metric but could be replaced by some other weighted average.    On The Horizon/ Navigating the waters between now (SCD) and MCD with the DSR  What is the best way to transition over, step by step? Mrabino gave a good 1st take on a wise method to set it up.    On The Horizon/ Is anything wrong with the DSR and Stability Rate calculations as planned for MCD?  Under the currently proposed system and policy, there is no adequate tool that can be used to curtail a high demand for a single collateral package without negatively affecting other collateral packages, especially those with lower risk premiums.    Risk Vishesh: Dai Analytics 26:22  Relevant links Graphs about Maker Graphs about DeFi Loans DAI 24hr VWAP Graph Dai Price: 26:22   The peg is good at the moment, almost squarely at $1. The trading volumes recently are relatively low, today around 3.9MM. They are light, but not so small that we should be concerned about Dai price distortion. We had been below the peg on average for the first weeks in July, but have since recovered. Some of the driver of the Dai price is the Eth price, not just the Stability Fee. We\u2019ve entered into a bit of \u201cperiodicity\u201d with what\u2019s going on with Dai. Meaning you can see the lag in the result of the past Stability Fee adjustments. The correlation between the Stability Fee and the Dai Price is not a very strong relationship, but when you see it in the context of multiple variables, it begins to make sense. At the time of the 20.5% SF adjustment, ETH was experiencing sudden downward price movement. During the decrease, we didn\u2019t see any immediate effect on the Dai price, but after the ETH decrease, it began to move back up to $1. Leveraging behavior affects the Dai price most; the Stability Fee is like a sensitivity parameter to Dai. The volatility of Dai has decreased compared to the past (Early March)  Dai Supply: 36:25   You can see some periodicity in the repeated patterns under very different Stability Fee rates.  See March-May & June-Aug sections of the Dai Supply chart on http://makerdao.descipher.io/  Dai was far more volatile during the March-May period, the supply was higher, oversupply higher, but in terms of nominal price and supply, it wasn\u2019t a huge difference.   Dai is a very high time-preference currency, very often (at least when it comes to dealing with CDPs) At a higher Stability Fee we are seeing less Dai volatility.  I think this may also be attributed to higher confidence in the ability to arbitrage Dai as well. Also, I believe less oversupply is also lowering the volatility.   With the 20.5% SF, and a tremendous amount of stress on the people longing ETH, we saw a considerable decrease in supply from 93MM down to 78MM. This recent supply drop has been a legitimate destruction of oversupply.  Circulation & Age of Debt: 41:45   Open debt had decreased in age while closed Dai debt has increased to the point where its higher than the age of open debt.  Effectively this means more old loans are getting paid back. Repayment of old debt is a useful metric. It keeps unrealized fees lower. It decreases overall risk, and it increases the financial efficiency of the Dai economy.   The decrease in open_dai_days ties into the metric of more of the new debt being drawn out of newer CDPs and less new debt has been created recently, while more old debt has been closed out. This makes sense considering the enormous drop in the Dai supply recently.  Collateralization Ratio: 43:52   With the 20.5% increase, CR had run-up due to wipes of Dai and not an equivalent removal of collateral.  Secondary Lending Platforms: 48:25   This is where the magic has been going on for the past week. We saw the Dai market on Compound increase by about 10 MM, 30MM+ market now. I don\u2019t want people to think this massive Dai supply drop is a bad thing. It\u2019s not that simple. It was a destruction of oversupply, there may be some slight decrease in demand (it would be stupid to exclude that scenario), but this is not the whole picture. The Weighted-Average-Borrow-Rate(WABR) has come up within spitting distance from the Stability Fee because of the interest rate model update and overall utilization of SLPs. Compound utilization has been consistently high.  Excess amount of supply is very low, less than 2MM total usually.   38% of total supply of Dai is being borrowed on SLPs.  This isn\u2019t something to be worried about per se. The narrative of SLPs taking market-share away from Maker is mistaken. At least half of the decrease in the Dai supply can be reasonably explained by increased awareness and usage of SLPs.   The increased amount of SLP usage has made the market more efficient. Awareness is up. This explains a good portion of what\u2019s going on with the decrease in supply. This does not signal a decrease in demand but instead looks like an increase in market efficiency.  Questions to Vishesh   31:00 Rich: How hard is it to figure out the sensitivity level of the SF to the ETH price and Dai peg? Is it possible to determine?  It is possible. When I initially ran the numbers, I found a very reliable r^2 value when looking at the relationship between ETH and Dai price using SF as a modifier. It was in the range of 60-70% before the recent crash. While direct relationship between ETH and Dai price was 20-30%. There are proxies for understanding leveraging behavior that we need to use since we don\u2019t have a direct variable that shows leveraging behavior. Looking at some of these proxies is decent, but a more holistic view is looking at the ETH & Dai graphs and asking yourself questions to help you understand what\u2019s going on.    45:22 David: Are the # of ETH locked in CDPs with 0 Dai debt an important metric to keep track of? Is this being filtered out in these charts?  In terms of total collateral in the system, I believe I am still counting this ETH. Though most of the calculations I do I filter out 0 debt CDPs. I\u2019ve graphed them before. It\u2019s an edge case and is not a significant portion of the ETH supply in the Dai Credit System.    55:45 David: Do you see parity between the Maker SF and Borrow rates on SLPs as a significant point of data?  It is significant. Dai is inherently asymmetric. If you drop the Stability Fee below the Compound borrow rate, you will incentivize refinancing. Refinancing back to Maker might happen quicker since the rate is more predictable than the Compound borrow rate.    01:00:09 David: What would we have to see for rates on Dai borrowing to become naturally lower?  The question is, when do you consider data-driven reasons for decreasing the stability fee? You watch excess supply and utilization rates on SLPs. You ask, to what extent is there an excess Dai supply and to what extent can that shield the demand curve from the Stability Fee being potentially too high. You don\u2019t lower the Stability Fee to lower it; you should only lower it when the data shows that it is too high. This is an important subtle point that gets lost. I think it\u2019s dangerous to make decisions that are not based on any good reasoning.    01:09:30 Psybull: Is the SF being above the max cap of Compound an issue? I\u2019m afraid it creates an issue where it will always be incentivizing refinance to the point of 100% utilization constantly. I worry this could create an adverse feedback loop.  I am more worried about the rates being higher than the Maker SF. This would cause refinancing and an increase in Dai supply. I think it\u2019s in Maker\u2019s best interest for SLPs to have lower borrow rates. It could be bad for the peg during a scenario where the supply rate is higher than the SF.    01:19:30 Psybull: What do people think about posting their voting rationale?  David: It\u2019s good when it\u2019s done well. It gives newcomers the ability to see the reasoning for other voters. However, the cognitive overhead seems like a lot. Though it may be useful to have as an option. Vishesh: I agree with your conclusion but going to push back on the reason. I think there is a problem in Maker Governance in that there is a disconnect between the conversation and what the votes end up being. I believe in order to have effective governance we need to resolve that gap. I think there is a lack of visibility into the thought processes and rationale behind voter decisions.

This meeting will be special for two reasons:   We have some weighty concepts to discuss.   This is the 100th Governance Call.     How did we get here? Where are we going? What does that mean? We are not going to be getting into any of those topics today. I was hoping to do skits, perhaps a virtual cake, a retrospective, etc. The ecosystem has not given us that space, so we will leave the congratulations and celebrations until another time.   It is important that we get this show on the road.   We desperately want to hear from the ecosystem; a lot of smart people are on this call. Do not be shy, if you have a question, type your questions in the chat or jump on the mic. Please keep in mind that conversations happening in the sidebar don\u2019t make into the public record or historical memory of MakerDAO, so if you have something smart to say, please consider participating on the microphone.   There\u2019s going to be a timer for each one of the presentations, so please try to keep your segments to five minutes or less if you can.   Discussions happen in the Forum.   Forum Recap LongForWisdom Governance at a Glance 02:55 Governance at a Glance - Forum Thread Peg Stabilization Modules: A Pre-MIP Discussion   Peg Stabilization Modules - Forum Thread  I guess that the most urgent discussion is the discussion around the Peg Stabilization Modules(PSM.) We\u2019ll be getting into that a bit later.    Governance Chief Contract Redesign: A Pre-MIP Discussion   Governance Chief Contract Redesign - Forum Thread  In addition to that, we\u2019ve had Derek, who has posted on the forum talking about the DSChief contract redesign. Fairly soon, there\u2019s going to be a chance to replace DSChief. Derek is going to talk more about that in a future meeting, but there is a thread on the forum if anyone is interested prior to that.    SourceCred Trial: Review of Month 1, Payout Increase   SourceCred Trial 1 Month Review - Forum Thread  We also had Seth from SourceCred post the first-month review of the SourceCred trial, which has got some interesting data on it. So if people are not keeping track of that, I would suggest checking that out, giving it a read.    Signal Request Increase duration of governance security module?   GSM delay increase - Forum Thread  We had Joshua_Pritikin asking whether we should consider increasing the duration of the GSM delay up to 24 hours to help protect against Governance attacks.    Signal Request Should MakerDAO signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers to be disabled?   COMP rewards signalling - Forum Thread  We\u2019ve also had Lev, or equivrel on the forum, asking if Maker should signal to Compound that we would prefer COMP rewards to be turned off for Dai because of the effect that it\u2019s having on the peg. So those are both up on the forum currently.    Signal Request Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium   WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium - Forum Thread  The previous signal requests to adjust the WBTC debt ceiling and risk premium had been passed, and Debt Ceiling has already been used up. This signal request thread is over.    MakerMan Vault Compensation Plan - Forum Poll 40:35   Compensation Plan Forum Poll - Forum Thread  The informal Compensation Plan poll is out. Eventually, we will do one on-chain. Even if we move at a slow pace, we can move forward, one way or another.    MIPs Charles St. Louis Weekly MIPs Update 5:38 Weekly MIPs Update843\u00d7477 115 KB This week&#39;s activity (July 6 - July 10)1406\u00d7790 162 KB   Last week was this gap week between June and July, where we had a pause for people to collect themselves, and for proposals to get finalized and drafted up.   Last week was quite calm. This week we had the formal submission period from July 6th to July 8th, ending yesterday. We saw seven proposals come in; I\u2019ll review them on the next slide.   We also saw two new Pre-MIP discussions posted to the \u201cProposal Ideas\u201d subcategory.   PSM: Peg Stabilization Module   Governance Chief Contract Resedign     I urge everyone to go and check those out or constantly review them; I know the Peg Stabilization Module forum thread is quite busy.   The Community Greenlight Polls ended on Monday, the Collateral Status Index was updated to reflect the results. These will eventually lead into the collateral onboarding discussions later on.   Formal submissions1365\u00d7696 120 KB   MIP19: I believe Mariano will be speaking briefly on it later in the call.   MIP18c4-SP1 aims to remove the DSR spread from weekly Polls.   Lastly, we have a MIP12 amendment proposal for improving the efficiency of overall collateral onboarding for both the domain team and the overall process, finally clearing up everything that should allow us to use all the monthly cycles for collateral onboarding going forward.   Request for comments1358\u00d7555 43.6 KB   MIP15 Dark Fix Mechanism is one month away from entering a Governance cycle, once the author Wil Barnes has officially added it or the edits from the community that he thinks are reasonable.   MIP14 I believe it\u2019s still in the request for comments because it was rejected from formal submission and is going to be reviewed for the community.

Join the community1355\u00d7693 61.5 KB  That\u2019s my bit for today. I urge you to check out all of the proposals that have been formally submitted in the Forums, and I will be posting my weekly MIPs update this week as well, recapping everything I just spoke about.  LongForWisdom MIPs Submission Review 11:12   Charles just covered the seven proposals that are going to be submitted for July. There are four MIPs: MIP 16, 17, 18, and 19, and there are a few sub-proposals.   I don\u2019t think there are any issues with the currently proposed MIPs that would prevent them from continuing as the inclusion Poll, so they will continue.   I would ask people to at least read the summaries of what was proposed because there are a few that changed things or introduced new things.   Smart Contracts Mariano Conti Liquidations v1.1 12:17   Liquidation 1.1 finally got into the Governance Cycle, so that\u2019s going to be voted on at the end of the month.   You all should know about this by now, I\u2019ve talked about it plenty of times. It fixes a couple of things, the double liquidity needed for all of our auction types, plus fixing the bug that we saw in March, where debt auctions could be stuck. There is a lot more information in the MIPs write-up.   This is not a big change, but it will mean that there are going to be new deployments for the smart contracts. Anybody running a keeper, things like DeFi Saver, even our internal UIs, will all need to be updated to the new addresses, so we are going to have a more aggressive message in the coming weeks, giving out the deployed addresses and everything so people can switch on time.   If you have any questions, ask me in Chat, @mariano.conti, or in the Forums.   Relevant Links MIP 19 - Liquidation System Upgrade - Forum Thread TUSD Update 13:47   I do want to give an update on TrueUSD. We have Lucas Manuel from the Smart Contracts\u2019 team working on reviewing the latest implementation. So now, we are in touch with the TrueUSD team, and they are going to do another upgrade to their token in less than two weeks. This time they\u2019ve already deployed the code for us to give it a look before and give our recommendation about whether we feel that it\u2019s safe. And if we do, we are going to recommend that the community reactivates TrueUSD using a weekly governance cycle, maybe next week or the week after. This will also guide us in the future for how we are to work with other tokens that feature this proxy upgrade system.   That was an announcement. We don\u2019t have anything concrete with TrueUSD yet, we are going over it, but I think we\u2019ll have more information next week.   Oracles Niklas Kunkel New Oracle Proposals 15:35  I want to give a quick overview of the oracle proposals that we\u2019ve seen on the forum recently. Keep in mind that because we haven\u2019t done the refactor of MIP10: Oracle Management yet, it\u2019s a similar situation with what we\u2019re doing with LEND where we go through a weekly cycle instead of a monthly one. We will try to align the timing of the Oracle related proposals with the monthly cycle to keep up a consistent cadence.  Argent Light Feed  We have an application from Argent to become a light feed. I\u2019ll be doing the due diligence on the information that they have provided on that proposal and posting it early next week.  Kyber Oracle Proposal  We have a proposal from Kyber to create a KNC-ETH oracle for them, that they will use for their buy-and-burn model for the KNC token. We will be doing that as well.  Raise the Quorum   We\u2019re starting to add a lot of feeds, so the number of feeds is growing a lot. In SCD we had 14. With MCD we launched with 20, and now we\u2019re at 24. 25 if Argent gets ratified to be a feed as well, and I\u2019m working with a couple of other groups in the background that are interested in applying. Part of having new feeds is that you have more data to work with, but the risk increases as well, there are now more parties that can be malicious. I want to create a proposal to raise the quorum. Right now, it\u2019s at 13, so if we want to keep a similar ratio, I think it should be 15, and possibly even 17, moving forward. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very controversial, but it needs to be discussed. I\u2019ll post the proposal early next week with the reasoning, and we\u2019ll talk with Charles if it needs to go through the weekly or the monthly cycle, in which case it will get pushed into the August cycle.  Rich Brown: Thanks, Nik. Looking forward to those discussions. Maybe when you kick them off, you can add some indication of the urgency to help us discern in which cycle to include them.    Risk Kiaresh New wBTC Merchants 19:30   Bittrex is launching a wBTC-BTC, ETH, and USDT pairs, I think, later today.   Also Alameda Research, Swipe Wallet, and Three Arrows Capital are becoming wBTC merchants, so we\u2019re expecting that to help with liquidity quite a bit.   Rich Brown: Interesting. I think this speaks to the DC of the wBTC. If that could be added to the ongoing discussions in the forums, so it\u2019s a bit stickier than this call, that\u2019d be great.

Relevant Links   MIP19: Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade - Forum Thread   Peg Stabilization Modules: A Pre-MIP Discussion - Forum Thread   Forum Poll: Deciding the Peg Stabilization Modules Implementation Timeline - Forum Thread   Discussion 31:48 PSM Operational Bounds Visualization PSM - Christopher&#39;s Diagram1221\u00d7334 53.2 KB   Christopher Mooney: I have mixed feelings about the PSM. But, if I can convey this one idea, it would alleviate a lot of my concerns. Vault holders have a very strong market incentive to maintain the peg. The PSM would allow us to create an emergency mechanism on the edges of where we would find the peg to be so far out of bound that we would want this Module to spin up and take over. So the red is where the PSM would be running. The green on top and below the red is to indicate that the PSM would have a debt ceiling.   Any time the peg would go over the limit (in the diagram, 1.03), the PSM would be this natural mechanism to dump some stablecoin collateral into the system and get Dai out. This should, in theory, outside of these ranges, push back down to the 1.03 mark. Once you hit that DC, you go back to the market incentives that the vault holders have, which appear very strong. A Vault holder in this area will create a vault and mint Dai to arbitrage the peg.   And on the low end, you could unload the PSM. We have a lot of control mechanisms to control the low end. We can more likely unload this thing closer to a dollar, so we can use other mechanisms around this lower area.     Potential Downside Of The PSM  Christopher Mooney: Sorry if the diagram doesn\u2019t convey the meaning that well, I just made it. The more we tighten this band and get to 1, the more I think it will remove the very natural market mechanism we have with vault holders. There\u2019s an entire mechanism for balancing the peg that we would snipe out the closer we get to that dollar mark.  A Tool on the Edges  Christopher Mooney: I like the PSM as a tool that sits on the edges and prevents situations like the one during Black Thursday; I think at some point, we saw 1.14 on an exchange. That would allow this instant, natural, cycle down, very low friction, permissionless, way to do that. I still believe in the core mechanism of the Maker Protocol: vault holders being the ones that arbitrage the peg. I want everyone to be extremely aware that if we kill that mechanism (the green area on the diagram), that could be disastrous for the protocol. The same way as being off the peg is disastrous.  Feeding a Negative Feedback Loop  Wouter: Looking at the peg today, if it starts trading outside of that range you indicate, then it shows that the mechanism that\u2019s supposed to take care of it is not working well enough, so you\u2019re getting to a point where you would get into a negative spiral or negative feedback loop. So pushing back to that area, supporting the market makers, to me, it makes a lot of sense, but I\u2019m not a risk analyst.  ",

                    "content": "The Extent of the PSM 36:10  Rich Brown: I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how much downward pressure the PSM could possibly exert before it exhausts itself. How much utility can be brought to bear here? If there\u2019s a significant deviation from the peg, people are piling in, and we don\u2019t want that to happen; How much of a buffering effect can this thing have? Or is the extent of the utility here that once the buffer is expanded, that\u2019s the end of the utility of the PSM?  Having Several PSMs  MakerMan: My reaction was, \u201chave a spread of PSMs.\u201d The \u201cwide\u201d is the liquidity provider of last resort. The narrow is that you want to provide some liquidity. That\u2019s the one you put the lightest DC on. Your job is good when these things aren\u2019t being tapped at all, and it\u2019s living on the narrowest range. And you put a light DC there to provide liquidity. You take the bet. If it\u2019s down, we\u2019ll buy it, because we\u2019re going to be back at one and we know it. If it\u2019s high, you sell it and get back eventually. It\u2019s the wide range where we experience heavy hands. If we hit 1.02 or 1.03, we come in with the heavier hand, and we take that bet because we know that it\u2019s going to go back to 1, and it\u2019s our job to do it. We need to provide liquidity to markets when they need it.  Starting with a Wide PSM  MakerMan: The question is, how much? Someone asked me about how much. We talked about 50 million. How do you get it? It\u2019s a question of tools you apply to the system. I like the idea of at least starting with a wide PSM. Maybe at 10 or 20 million USDC as an experiment? Along with reducing rates and making sure our debt ceilings are high so that it\u2019s used. We can take a stab at this market with 50 million Dai and see what happens. Compound is offering two times the Dai market cap as a yearly return on a billion dollars. That\u2019s a big driver. It beats us hands down. How much cap do you have to have to be able to absorb this? You can do the math on that and put it out. From what I\u2019m seeing, it\u2019s decaying, though.  Potential Downside: Strangling the Free Market 41:40   Christopher Mooney: I suggested something similar back in April, and fell out of love with the idea because I was worried about its effects on market behavior. Currently, today we expect the vault holder to see the market incentive: high peg means an arbitrage, but they have to lock their capital up and hope or have faith that the peg will eventually return back down so that they realize the profits. While they\u2019re doing that, they\u2019re taking the risk. With the PSM, market makers can instantly turn that profit, MKR holders bear all the risk until the peg drops back down. I want to highlight this because I have a concern, the same way we added USDC-A as an emergency facility for liquidity for liquidations, that governance will see this and eventually will want a half a percentage deviation from the peg, or 25 basis points and lock this down, and strangle off the free market or more virtuous cycle that would exist there.  Christopher Mooney: When we do that, we shift the entire mechanism where we charge this rate for holding these assets over time, and that accrues in the surplus buffer, and that compensates MKR holders with the burn. That burn exists because we have a risk on the other end of the market, where we would need to mint MKR to recapitalize the system. The risk of the long-hold mechanism is borne entirely by the Protocol and MKR holders. We give the profit to the market makers. The closer you get to the 1:1 peg, the more we kill our existing incentive mechanism, and we create this weird perverse incentive that could be disastrous for the protocol. It\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019ll let that idea stand. I have other objections that I think we should think about.    Tough to Step Back   Monet Supply: I think that looking at other entities that have started market-making, as Japan in their government bonds, it\u2019s really tough to step back from this market engagement once you start it. We agree that it will be tough to pull back the support if we start doing this.  Rich Brown: The question of how do we unwind is important. Do people have thoughts on how to mitigate that risk?    Competing USDC-A and PSM 46:14   Akash: This is my own personal opinion, but I\u2019ll just throw out what I think might be interesting. Having the USDC-A vault at 4% is interesting, but that\u2019s for market makers that want to take on risk and are willing to ride it out for a year and pay 4% for the year. The problem is that there are not enough market makers with infinite liquidity, so at a certain point, the Protocol providing liquidity at a very high payment rate is maybe OK. So what I\u2019m suggesting is having the USDC-A vault at 4%, as it currently is. But also having the PSM there, you switch 1:1, but you pay a 4% fee, let\u2019s say, to immediately convert your USDC to Dai, for example. So that a 4% fee is immediate, and it goes to the Protocol. So now you have two mechanisms battling to get the peg stabilized. This is my personal opinion; I have no idea if it\u2019s correct. I\u2019m curious about what other people think.   Christopher Mooney: The 4% would go instantly to the protocol and MKR holders. So it compensates for that risk over the next year. The problem is, \u201cwhat happens to the Protocol if it holds the asset longer than a year?\u201d   LongForWisdom: We have a similar problem with vaults, right? They pay 4% a year, but they pay it gradually over the year. If the collateral type explodes before the year goes out, we\u2019re still on the losing side. It switches from long term to short term. It\u2019s not fundamentally different. It just switches that around. It could be useful to have one set of tools that allows you to capture that immediately and the other one that allows you to do it over time. That could be useful.   Akash: To be clear, I suggest having both. Having as many tools as possible to bring the Dai peg back down to a dollar.     The Price Bands to Help the Peg 49:10   Brian McMichael: I like the idea of having a limit at 1.03 to 1.05. That puts us in a situation where we\u2019re saying to the community that Dai will not go beyond that as measured against USDC. That is an open question for the community to determine the level we\u2019re comfortable with. We were at 1.02 for a few weeks there, and that was not very comfortable for many people.  Wil Barnes: This might change the current price situation, just hanging out at 1.02.    The Importance of the Debt Ceiling  Cyrus Younessi: The real question is not what we set the bands to or even what we set the fee to but rather what is the max tolerable debt ceiling for the collateral type. The most important takeaway is that this is an increase in collateral. The notion that we went from one model of incentivizing market makers to mint Dai and wait for the peg to converge back, versus now swapping that out immediately on the fly. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s as important, because the end state for Maker in both situations is the same: Maker has a bunch of collateral, and there\u2019s a bunch of Dai outstanding. The New PSM makes that more profitable for people who interact with the PSM. You can view it as a subsidy or a negative rate. The real issue is, \u201chow big would we be willing to go with the USDC-A DC and how big with the PSM.\u201d The bands and the fees and all that are, for me, are second-order details.  How Long are we Willing to Carry USDC?   Brian McMichael: We\u2019re using USDC as a measuring stick, which has five times the market cap that Dai currently has. I am of the opinion that US citizens are using Coinbase to on-ramp dollars, where they can do that for free into USDC. They can off-ramp Coinbase onto Ethereum Mainnet, and at that time, they need to dump USDC for something else. If they want to keep in dollar-denominated terms, they\u2019ll go to Dai or else they\u2019ll go to ETH, but we\u2019re not in a market where people are buying USDC to trade back into dollars. If this were a Forex market, we would be seeing fluctuations between competing currencies, and I think we need to understand the macro situation of the fact that we\u2019re going into another bull market, and people are trying to throw dollars into Ethereum. We\u2019re just a more desirable place to be right now, but we don\u2019t have the supply to get there. This may be a great way to go if we need to increase the supply to meet demand. I\u2019m concerned with how long we have to carry this and the risks that that entails.  Cyrus Younessi: That\u2019s the same as asking how long would we be willing to carry the current USDC collateral? If the current USDC is under our tolerable max debt ceiling, then we don\u2019t care for how long. Once you go above what you\u2019re comfortable with, is when you start asking how long do we have to keep this on the books for? And then you start getting into questions about how big is Maker\u2019s capacity to take on USDC and if they\u2019re willing to hold it beyond a reasonable timeline. I think the most important question is, how big is the community willing to let the PSM get? I think that needs to be answered before we start talking about ranges and fees and 1.03, or 1.02.    How Far is Off-Peg? 53:56   LongForWisdom: I\u2019m not sure I agree. I think that the bands are one of the more important issues. I feel that there\u2019s a difference of opinion about how far off-peg is too far? We\u2019re currently at 1.015 or something, which is one and a half percent. Do people think that\u2019s too much? The kind of message that we\u2019re getting from the Foundation is that it is too much, based on this presentation.   Wouter: You cannot express this as 1% is too much, 2% is too much. It\u2019s more about the average price over the longer period of time as long as its fluctuation is around the dollar. Right now, it\u2019s above.   LongForWisdom: Sure, but even if we turn on PSM, that can\u2019t push it below peg, right? Maybe push it to the peg? So we\u2019re never going to drop below peg, unless we get supply from somewhere else.     Confidence in the System   Wouter: The nuance is that you\u2019re creating improved confidence in the system again, so people will start acting in a way that assumes that the peg is fixed again, and then you will see that fluctuation again. I think it\u2019s a matter of getting away from that negative feedback loop.   LongForWisdom: I don\u2019t entirely disagree with you. I think that the definition of the negative spiral is possibly incomplete. You\u2019re essentially saying that this negative spiral will reduce the amount of Dai, which is obviously not something we want in general. But the system does have measures that when the amount of Dai reduces, then the price of Dai drops below one, and we can start increasing the DSR and other things to prompt more demand.   Wouter: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. A system that\u2019s out of balance overall has a confidence problem. It\u2019s not just Dai users. Otherwise, the peg would be restored. I think that the general confidence in the system is much broader than just Dai users.     Partners Integrating Dai 57:21   Gregory Di Prisco: LongForWisdom, you\u2019re referencing a very short term cycle where we have these levers to pull that affects the Dai peg, but I think that the spiral that Wouter is talking about is more long term and systemic to what we\u2019re doing. If you look at the way that Dai has propagated in the market, its utility is derived from network effects via our integration partners. I deal with the majority of our integration partners from the Foundation standpoint. Since March, we\u2019ve seen six decentralized applications that decided to use USDC over Dai. That\u2019s troubling to me, and when I called them to ask why, they unanimously cite the instability of Dai. That\u2019s tough to overcome but not impossible if we take the peg seriously. I\u2019m nervous if we start tapping them for providing demand in the first place. I think that\u2019s a really dangerous precedence to set. Imagine that one of the partners integrate and start being successful, and you come back to them and tell them that they\u2019re providing too much demand, stop. It\u2019s going to provide a massive deterrent to integrate Dai in the first place, and it\u2019s going to have negative effects on the overall network. If those network effects start to deteriorate, we lose our moat and competitive advantage.  LongForWisdom: Broadly, I agree with that. As the natural demand decreases because the peg is too high, that pushes down the demand for Dai, which then allows us to raise rates, which increase the DSR, which increases the demand for Dai again. At that point, we can offer the DSR again, and all these integration partners are integrating this coin, which has benefits to holding it, holding Dai, and offering interest in addition to their regular functionality. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong; I\u2019m saying there is a chance that it will come back again. The system incentives push that demand to come back again. The reason we have this problem is that we have extended our demand-side and we can\u2019t keep it on the supply side. So the solution is to increase the supply side, or reduce the demand side until we can keep up with it, right?    Decreasing Demand Not an Option  Wouter: I think that\u2019s where the reality is a little bit different. You need integration partners; you need business partners, who put a lot of work, time, and investment into building the system and supporting the product. You cannot tell them, \u201cWe\u2019re currently off-peg, we\u2019re going to more-or-less shut down your product because the use case is destroyed for some time. But come back in January, and things will be fine again.\u201d That\u2019s where the theory of the economic model clashes with reality. That is exactly the concern that we hear that as a governance community, they are not appreciative enough of this. You say that there is a chance that they come back, but if you look at the investment needed to support a product, I would say that there\u2019s a chance that they don\u2019t come back.  The Cost for Partners of Integrating an Instrument 01:01:24   Kurt: There\u2019s a very high cost to doing these integrations from the engineering and logistics perspective. Once a project decides between Dai versus USDC, and they go with USDC, it\u2019s not like they can flip a switch and go to Dai later. It\u2019s a very sticky thing, and you get these network effects that Wouter alluded to, and it becomes non-linear.  Wouter: This is a very interesting phenomenon. This is very different from vault holders, for example. I think that people looking for leverage will better understand and know that they can change markets and refinance. Dai integrations and Dai users are very different. It points to the same thing that we need to consider these use cases and that perspective more in-detail, and realize that it\u2019s not a symmetric situation.    Asymmetric Risks and the positive feedback loop that may be caused by the PSM   Akash: My own personal comment, in terms of positive feedback loops, right now, it\u2019s a little bit negative. Nobody knows when to sell Dai. So they kind of step out of the way, which allows Dai to go higher and higher above peg. There are two negative feedback loops:   One is, Natural market makers are hesitant to sell because it can blow up in their faces.   The second is vault owners who are doing leverage trading are unsure too because when they\u2019re closing out their vaults, they\u2019re not sure where their worst-case scenario buying Dai could be.   To add, speculators will come and buy Dai because the downside is 1, but the upside is asymmetric.     If you have the PSM with a fee at 5%, people will actually step in front of the PSM, because they know that the downside is at 1.05, so they\u2019ll step in at 1.04, knowing that it will come back to 1 dollar. Those are asymmetric risks. Having the PSM and other tools where people are confident that there\u2019s a big market maker at 1.05, the MKR holders create a positive feedback loop to get the price down.   Using the Auction System 1:04:48  MakerMan: If we take the outside of the trade around 1, you can use it to test your auction system. Particularly from the high-side down, you can buy Dai at 1.05 and basically offer the auction, basically take anything down to 1.0. And do it periodically. Just throw it out. You can literally test the auction by being the outside bidder in the market. And everybody will sit in front of us. Great! Let them! We want them to. Ideally, they will sit there with Dai, just holding it. Will it be a profitable trade? I don\u2019t know. But the fact that it limits the peg at 1.05 or whatever number you pick, I think that\u2019s a great thing, it kind of all works. And the idea of using the auction system to take the in-between, just offer it. Whatever the market will give you in there and wants to, let it because you don\u2019t care. You want to recycle that trade and be done with it. And get it out of the system ultimately. And don\u2019t let it go if it goes below 1. Be like, \u201cI\u2019ll keep it. Thank you. We\u2019ll try again later\u201d. It\u2019s great from the auction system perspective. Doing this PSM to collect collateral to throw at the markets on both sides. The low side wouldn\u2019t work, I guess. The high side definitely works.  Setting Clear Boundaries  Will Remor in the chat: If this is used as a tool for monetary policy, would it make sense to add some clear boundaries on which kinds of situations this could be used, for what purposes, and at which DC/fees? The risk I see is that this becomes the default mechanism for price stabilization down the road because the system gets too accustomed to \u201ceasy fixes.\u201d  Changes to the Game Theory 01:07:30   Rich Brown: I\u2019m trying to understand where the incentivization mechanisms go in this Protocol when there is this soft landing or appeal to authority. Does this allow actors in the ecosystem to exploit the fact that they can play games with the peg, knowing that the Protocol will pick up the tab later? I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a clear model of how things could go wrong with this.   Akash: There\u2019s always a clear risk with USDC, or if we use TUSD, or whatever other stablecoin. There\u2019s always the underlying risk of that collateral.   Rich Brown: We\u2019re changing some of the game theory here, so my first question is how could it be exploited for gain. Actors in the ecosystem to take advantage of this.     Limits of PSM   Lev Livnev: inaudible   Rich Brown: I think the question was, \u201cDoes the PSM address the COMP risk?\u201d   LongForWisdom: That\u2019s what I got. Does anybody want to address that? It seems like a reasonable concern to me with the COMP farming that if we just offer a large amount of Dai for USDC it will potentially get taken for the COMP farming.   Rich Brown: This is not an infinite bag of stability. There\u2019s a hard limit to how much of a stabilization mechanism this thing can influence upward and downward pressure, right?     Dai as a Stablecoin Wrapper 1:10:45   Kurt: It depends on the debt ceiling that you put on it. The gamble is that by providing this sort of upper limit, and you can absorb X tens of millions of Dai, once you tap out that DC, there\u2019s no more ammunition left and the peg can proceed to deviate beyond that point, and then it becomes a moral hazard where Governance gets very tempted to expand that debt ceiling, and Dai becomes more and more a wrapper for whatever stablecoins are in that PSM bucket. I think that is the scenario that a lot of people worry about. That Dai becomes a USDC wrapper.   Rich Brown: I\u2019m trying to circle around that. I like numbers. Some kind of back-testing, or as an example, something saying \u201cduring Black Thursday, this would have lasted two weeks or seven hours\u201d. There\u2019s a risk-reward scenario here that needs to be understood. How much pressure can this thing absorb and does that additional window stability allow the ecosystem to come back to sanity and arbitrage the peg back down where it should be? It\u2019s a tool, how effective is that tool, and in which situations could it be deployed, and for how long would it be effective?   Wil Barnes: We don\u2019t necessarily need to keep USDC as the only stablecoin. We can add more stablecoins, so we don\u2019t have exposure to just one collateral type.   Wouter: I think it\u2019s a one-sided question. It\u2019s not really a question of \u201cwill it fix this?\u201d It\u2019s more, \u201cwill it improve it or make it worse?\u201d Same thing with new collateral types on vaults. You don\u2019t object to a new collateral type because you think, what happens if it bumps into the debt ceiling? It\u2019s just one more collateral type that helps. This is the same thing. It\u2019s one more tool that can help.   Rich Brown: If it\u2019s a useful tool in the toolkit, that\u2019s great. I just want to get a sense of how useful it is and for how long that utility would last and what the risks are.   Chris_p: It\u2019s the same class of risk. We can diversify stablecoins, but ultimately it will have the same effect. Calling it a USDC wrapper, or a wrapper for stablecoins is the risk. It seems there are other tools in the toolkit, as opposed to something that seems a bit new.     Dai to Satisfy the Comp Demand 1:15:09   Gregory Di Prisco: I\u2019m trying to guess how much Dai we actually need to satisfy the COMP demand. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s as much as we think it is, because we get so much COMP earning leverage with Dai there. There is a lower bound on the amount of yield that a COMP farmer will accept. If you can go with USDC to BlockFi and earn 8%, you\u2019re not going to mine COMP for 5%. I haven\u2019t done the calculations, but I imagine that there\u2019s a way to do this more accurately.   LongForWisdom: Currently, we\u2019re dealing with COMP, but there are lots of other projects that are planning liquidity mining incentives as well. If we do have enough Dai to solve the issue with COMP, great, but I think that we\u2019ll find out that the problem comes back again soon.   Gregory Di Prisco: Yes, COMP today, something else tomorrow.     Increasing the Supply   Sam MacPherson: The choice seems pretty clear to me. We either have to grow the stablecoin supply in whatever way, be the PSM or USDC-A, or the peg is going to break. We just have to get the supply up. I don\u2019t see an alternative at this stage.   Rich Brown: Any idea here that the PSM as part of the toolkit will help bootstrap and create some breathing room that allows more actors to come into the ecosystem, which increases the supply, and that\u2019s the mechanism.   Akash: I\u2019m my opinion this is a virtuous cycle. The true solution is that we don\u2019t want to be the wrapper stablecoin. But you have to start off with that so that you can raise the ETH and wBTC debt ceilings because those people will have more confidence that when they need to close out, they can get a good Dai price. That is super important to them too. We want to be fully diversified, but I think this is a starting point, and it\u2019ll bring confidence in the other collateral types also. Just my opinion.     Separating the PSM and the Debt Ceilings Discussions 1:17:31  Rune Christensen: I want to make a couple of arguments echoing what\u2019s already been said. The first one is that it\u2019s very important to distinguish between the question of whether the PSM is a useful tool for Maker Governance, then what needs to be done about the peg emergency, the broken peg. It\u2019s been broken for three months, and it\u2019s a fundamental imbalance of the system. There are lots of different options here. One option that the PSM makes even more efficient is massively increasing the stablecoin debt ceilings. There are other options, as well. There\u2019s adding MKR as collateral; there are negative rates; there\u2019s also letting the peg break. What\u2019s important to keep in mind is that even if you\u2019re against any of these particular options, it doesn\u2019t make sense to discount the PSM as a tool in all other situations. Unless there\u2019s actually a problem with it as a tool, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s being discussed, right? The discussion is that we\u2019re looking at PSM, but we\u2019re actually talking about stablecoin debt ceilings. I think it\u2019s very important to keep those two things separated. You\u2019re maybe against a high stablecoin debt ceiling, but there are actually cases where the PSM will be a useful tool.  PSM as a Tool  Rune Christensen: One specific example is that if you have a PSM, even with a low debt ceiling, let\u2019s say with 10 million, or 20 million, basically a debt ceiling that\u2019s not enough to actually fix the peg. We\u2019re not talking about stablecoin expansion. We\u2019re talking adding PSM and shuffling the debt ceilings around, so now there are some stablecoins sitting in the PSM. It still has a very remarkable effect on the entire structure of Maker and the entire paradigm of Dai liquidity. It means that now you\u2019re always able to cash out of Dai at extreme levels of liquidity. Potentially 20 million in one go, and you have a totally guaranteed price for it, right? Even when the peg is broken, just because the peg is right now trading above a dollar, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can actually come as a vault user and you can instantly generate, say, five million Dai, or 10 million Dai, or 20 million Dai, and actually cash that out at any sort of reliable value. You really need to have trading counterparties, and you need to be in every single DEX. It\u2019s quite complicated to actually cash out Dai at a good price, even when the peg is broken. The PSM totally changes that. And from that perspective it just, objectively, in my opinion, improves the user experience for any type of user of the system, but particularly it\u2019s important that it improves it for vault holders, because that\u2019s where it creates this positive effect that helps fix the real underlying issue, which is the imbalance of the system.  Fixing the Peg  Rune Christensen: The last comment I want to make is on the imbalance of the system itself. No matter what, Maker Governance has to fix the peg. It\u2019s complete suicide to actually signal an aversion to fixing the peg and preference to leave it broken because none of the options are pretty. At that point, if you signal that and the vault holders truly believe it, then you\u2019re basically telling them to run for the hills. Because then there\u2019s no guarantee that the peg will even hold, so you have no idea what it\u2019s actually going to cost you pay down your vault. It obviously generally increases uncertainty and even taxes the system on the path to emergency shutdown. I think that\u2019s very important. In that context, it\u2019s not OK to leave the peg broken. The one thing that the system is supposed to do is to keep the peg. That\u2019s always been the case. I think that there\u2019s a number of arguments to be made for different approaches. Like negative rates are the really classic idea of what you have to do. But that\u2019s also what\u2019s been pointed out earlier. In this early phase of the system is much more disruptive when you\u2019re eroding all the faith and all the entrenchment that has happened so far. When you look at things like adding MKR as collateral or adding a lot of stablecoins to the system, it\u2019s taking a risk in a different way, but it\u2019s a solution that actually has a future, in my opinion, as compared to basically saying \u201clet\u2019s wind things down\u201d. It\u2019s really the question of whether Governance and the community expect Maker to move things forward or move backward as a response to this situation.  Outro Rich Brown 1:23:45   Thanks, Rune, for the thoughts. This is a long and very complicated discussion. Probably this will not be the last one that we\u2019ll have about the PSM. There are some very vibrant threads going on in the forums. I encourage people to get passionate about these particulars. There are decisions to be made about the next steps. I don\u2019t know what those are, and I would like the community to come back and make sure that its voice is heard, so we know how to move this thing forward. So please join us in the forum.   LongForWisdom: I already laid the next steps of what we\u2019re going to do here based on what happened last weekend. So just to show what\u2019s been said in the forums. We\u2019re going to spend July talking about this. There will be a segment in each Governance and Risk Meeting where we can discuss it. Hopefully, by the time we get to the third week of July, we\u2019ll have some idea of what we want the parameters to be so we can vote them on-chain at that point. And, by the end of the month, assuming that the on-chain polls are successful, we\u2019ll include them in the executive with the parameters that everyone\u2019s decided.   Rich Brown: Thanks for that far more detailed recap than the one that I wasn\u2019t prepared to give. There are things to be explored, pros and cons, refinements, game theory, and its optimization mechanisms, we talked about the toolkit and the benefit of adding incremental improvement to the Protocol, so I very much encourage people to join in.     Christopher Mooney: I thought I\u2019d mention that this is such an amazing project, we\u2019re at the 100th governance call, and we\u2019re discussing this very coveted good problem to have, which is that there\u2019s a ton of demand for Dai. Not just from COMP, but from all over the market. And most startups, most companies, would die to be in this position, no pun intended. Or maybe pun intended. I just wanted to call out, and I know that we have hard decisions to make, and it\u2019s going to be difficult to figure out how we scale, but this is the right set of circumstances that we want to grow this project. It\u2019s exciting to be here. It\u2019s exciting to be with you guys.  Rich Brown: Aw. Thanks, Chris. Ending this call in a positive spin. It didn\u2019t occur to me in the past, but maybe we should do that more often. Thanks, Chris. It\u2019s a great addition.    Rich Brown: That\u2019s it for the call. Thanks, everybody. Let\u2019s continue the discussion in the forums. Thanks for joining us.

                    "content": "Here is my take on the PSM.  Check it out, all thoughts are greatly appreciated! As far as the governance meeting goes, I watched it earlier today and wanted to give my responses: @cmooney I agree that the PSM should likely be set at $1.00 low end and $1.02 first batch high end to start with a low first debt ceiling of maybe $10,000,000 and then at $1.03 maybe 20, $1.04 30 and $1.05 50 or 100 as a starting point. @MakerMan Heavier hands as MakerDao goes up on each step just like you wanted.  By the time Dai got to $1.07 if it ever did the debt ceiling should be practically unlimited. (Do have to make sure that oracles are giving correct pricing though). @cyrus I agree that the PSM is sort of acting as a negative rate which is why it is so useful.  MakerDao does not want to go negative rates on Dai directly.  This method would allow for negative rates but keep the value of Dai intact.  You mentioned the max debt ceiling as being the biggest thing you want figured out right now.  I would suggest we start with what I suggested to @cmooney above but if what I wrote for the PSM solution is workable the debt ceiling at the high end if Dai makes it up to $1.07 ever would be essentially unlimited. @rich.brown Relating to the crises in March a PSM would have made the maximum Dai price maybe hit $1.03 or $1.04 in this model.  As a result it would have made things a lot smoother.  However, just having more Dai liquidity wasn\u2019t going to necessarily help for those zero bid auctions that took place.  We will have to have the updated liquidation system fix that moving forward.  The PSM would have been helpful though and MakerDao would have profited from it.  You also asked for pain points of a PSM.  I mentioned a few of them in the con list I made for the other post.  Please give that a look and hopefully people will chime in with their thoughts in the comments over there. @monet-supply I agree, once we start a PSM it will be super hard to take it away if MakerDao ever wanted to.  The hope is that there will not be a need to do so and that MakerDao can simply make the PSM a functional part of the ecosystem.  It will require a lot of thinking though so please share your thoughts both for and against the PSM as they come to you. @mrsky @akash.patel @akash98 @brianmcmichael Not sure which Akash you are and I lumped you in here Brain because my notes merged.  You are right that the PSM will be much needed confidence to both vault owners and to Dai market participants.  You mentioned that \u201cnobody knows when to sell Dai right now\u201d.  This seems to hit the nail on the head.  There is too much uncertainty going on and the ecosystem will benefit greatly from a show of MakerDao doing something to defend the Peg.  A PSM appears to be the best option at the present time.  As far as keeping the USDC vaults at 4% as well to let vault owners try to run Arb on the peg, I am not sure if this makes sense or not, it should be discussed further IMO. @LongForWisdom You made a lot of good points but two stood out.  \u201cHow far off the Peg is too far?\u201d Which I would say for MakerDao is up for debate.  The suggestion I made was to start at $1.02 and scale up to a max of $1.07 in the extreme just before a global settlement (meaning MakerDao would likely never see Dai anywhere near $1.07 and certainly not above it.)  $1.02 might be OK short term but ideally I feel like $1.02 at the most is too far before intervention is taken at least lightly for a PSM.  You had also mentioned that the system would work itself out as confidence in Dai falls if MakerDao just sort of lets this all happen.  I disagree.  The integration partners may never come back and also the vault holders also lose confidence so even if the confidence was spread evenly to all areas it would still be a feedback loop and not something that simply settles itself.  I appreciate your thoughts as always. I split this into a second post because I got cut off. ",

                    "content": "This is the 2nd post  @g_dip 100% agree with you that the peg drifting is something MakerDao should be defending because if not MakerDao is at risk of losing the competitive advantage that has been built up and eventually will have a weakened network effect.  As far as what is required to fix the peg right now, my best guess is something like $50,000,000 at $1.02 or $1.03 to keep it controlled and if MakerDao needed to bring it lower it could step it down from there but I think it would naturally come down anyway from there because of COMP pressure reducing over time as well as more Dai entering the market from lending out the USDC taken in by the PSM + new collateral types and ceiling being played with over time.  The confidence alone should also help things. Lev I don\u2019t know your name on here but yes I think that a PSM will address COMP if done correctly. @hexonaut I totally agree, MakerDao either increases Dai supply or the Peg breaks.  It is something that needs to be done.  A PSM is a great way to do so.  Do the other assumptions I have made in the forum post I linked above work in your mind? If not what needs tweaking? @Kurt_Barry There will be a big moral hazard with these debt ceilings should MakerDao ever get into a sticky situation later on.  That is why I am hoping to work out all of these details now so it is clear whether or not the idea of a PSM can and will work long term or does MakerDao need to pivot and redesign the product to facilitate negative rates.  I am hoping a PSM can work, let me know what you think, thank you. @rune You mentioned \u201cDo we move forward or backwards?\u201d in the meeting.  I would say forward of course, but we have to make sure that we have crafted a solution that can work in the future.  A PSM is a great way to solve the current problems I just want to be sure MakerDao also has options moving forward aside from global settlement or inflation of Dai.  I would greatly appreciate your take on what I wrote.  I also agree the PSM is an objective improvement over what MakerDao is doing right now. Thanks everyone, I enjoyed the meeting and look forward to discussing the PSM with you more on the forums! ",
