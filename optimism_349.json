I think allowing people without initial funds to become eligible will increase the number of people who would subsequently join the community.

Therefore I would rate the interaction done during this time less than the subsequent one, since only people who really  use the blockchain are rewarded and will also not make a quick profit out of the airdrop put rather hold it for the long term.
