                    "content": " Introduction The Collateral Risk Model, created by the @Risk-Core-Unit, supports the parameter proposal process for risk parameters such as Stability Fees and Debt Ceilings. The model was further extended into the (volatile crypto-collateral) Capital at Risk metric, an estimate for the necessary financial buffer of the Maker portfolio in case of potential protocol losses caused by major market shocks. We wrote before a deep dive into Capital at Risk methodology, explaining how it is derived from the Collateral Risk Model. We also explained what kind of model inputs we\u2019re using, both raw data and user inputs, the latter enabling us to get a better intuitive understanding of how changing (largely subjective) parameters impacts the model outputs. As we\u2019ve tried to consistently share with the community, simulation modeling can rarely, if at all, be separated from some kind of subjective inputs by the model designers and users. For this reason we prioritize sharing the simulation models openly for us to enable greater collective learning and exploration. Questions such as \u201cwhat should be our financial buffer?\u201d have no single \u201cobjective\u201d answers, they depend on modeling assumptions, which can be summarized as: \u201cwhat kind of portfolio/ecosystem/market shock do we want to be protected against?\u201d With these kinds of questions, our scope is limited to sharing a value which is derived from a series of model assumptions. Additionally, Capital at Risk is a metric that describes the potential protocol loss in a specific point in time, for this reason we are monitoring it on a continuous basis. Below you can find a high-level model diagram of the Collateral Risk Model:  To move beyond heuristics into deeper impact analysis, we also published research on Collateral Risk Model feature analysis, further extending how different model inputs impact the model outputs (Risk Premium, Debt Ceiling). We\u2019ve shown that these are the most important model inputs (each determined by vault type), sorted by importance:  Liquidity (quantified as Liquidity Score) Share of Vaults Protected (derived from Vault Protection Score) Debt-Weighted Collateralization Ratio Debt Exposure   Definitions of each of these inputs can be found in the report above. In this post, we\u2019ll dive deeper into Vault Protection Score which aims to estimate the probability of vault liquidation in times of major market downfalls. The initial methodology can be found in this post. We\u2019ve since been actively working on improving its underlying methodology, among other things by quantifying how actively vault owners manage their vaults and taking that into account when determining the risk score. The aim of this post is to evaluate how well the assigned vault protection scores estimate the probability of vaults being liquidated based on the available data from the last 6 months. We determine the liquidated vault\u2019s risk score by querying its assigned score the day before the liquidation. Also, to further elaborate on definitions - all debt exposure mentioned is collateralized by volatile crypto assets.  Analysis  Chart 1: Liquidated Debt per Risk Score In the chart 1 below we can see that most of the liquidated debt was assigned a Low risk score. This might seem counter-intuitive unless it\u2019s combined with the chart 2 which elaborates this further. In this period (6 months), around 205m of debt was liquidated.  1264\u00d7578 19.9 KB   Chart 2: Debt Exposure per Risk Score In chart 2, we can see that the majority of debt exposure has historically been assigned a Low risk score. That explains the dynamic in chart 1 given that there\u2019s been a much lower absolute debt exposure assigned as High risk. The proportion of Low risk exposure has recently decreased relative to other risk scores because we\u2019ve seen a larger decrease in whale exposure (which has mostly been assigned a Low risk score) compared to smaller vault owners\u2019 debt exposure. For instance, Nexo\u2019s vault in November 2021 contributed to about 30% of total debt exposure (at 1.5B), now it\u2019s down to around 5% of that (at 86M).  1252\u00d7586 44.5 KB   Chart 3: Share of Debt Exposure Liquidated per Risk Score Given that debt exposure has been assigned disproportionately across all risk scores, it\u2019s best to show liquidated debt relative to individual risk score\u2019s\u2019 total debt exposure. That\u2019s the aim of chart 3 below, combining chart 1 and chart 2 into a single metric. The percentage of debt exposure liquidated per risk score is calculated by fetching the monthly liquidated debt amount and dividing it by the median monthly debt exposure, all split by risk score. It\u2019s clear that High risk debt exposure shows a much larger probability of being liquidated, as intended. There is a large spike in January 2022 when the most significant liquidation day occurred (Flappy Friday). Around 20% of High risk debt exposure was liquidated in that month. The second spike is in May 2022 when 14% of High risk debt exposure was liquidated.  1225\u00d7569 47.8 KB   Chart 4: Flappy Friday Analysis We can also look into individual events. During Flappy Friday, Maker liquidated more than 60% of total liquidated debt from the last 6 months. The share increases to almost 70% if we leave out TUSD-A\u2019s off-boarding liquidations. This makes it a good candidate for further analysis. Similar to the pattern of January 2022 in the chart above, we can see that there is a clear pattern of decreasing percent of liquidated debt, the safer the assigned risk score is. Only 2% of Low risk debt exposure was liquidated, compared to 5% of Medium risk and 12% of High risk debt exposure.  1195\u00d7578 19.9 KB   Conclusion and Next Steps The second most important feature in computing Collateral Risk Model\u2019s outputs is Share of vaults\u2019 protected parameter. It is derived from the Vault protection score. As a starting point, we decided to choose a conservative rule of thumb that would approximate what proportion of risk score debt exposure would be liquidated during major market shocks. We aimed to gather the relevant data over time and adjust these chosen percentages based on what we\u2019d see empirically. The initial percentages were 10% for Low risk, 50% for Medium risk and 100% for High risk debt exposure. Given this analysis we decided to halve the percentages (5%, 25%, 50%) of expected debt exposure that we expect to be liquidated per risk score. It is still a conservative assumption, especially given that vault owners\u2019 skill of managing vaults has significantly improved since the times of Black Thursday. ",
