This style of presentation is often a presentation an executive team would give to a board of directors, but given the DAO doesn\u2019t have a CEO, this could instead be for those who have a deep interest in Gitcoin or hold large amounts of GTC. Thanks to everyone who made the weekly WS sync today. I appreciate the questions and for giving me the space to offer an opinion on the current state of the DAO. Here is the deck I ran through (huge thanks to Lindsey and the team for helping me compose these!) - Token Holders Update Sept 2022 - Google Slides The recording is here as well. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, especially if you could not attend. ",
