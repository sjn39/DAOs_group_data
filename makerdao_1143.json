Now you have to wonder what Maker governance would do if someone did this with 100K MKR.  So a real thought as to what to do generally (just like when 10M DAI was burned) that is fair in all cases should be undertaken.   I think a fee could be applied (some base fee + a percentage) for recovery. Without a real discussion in the DAO about a general solution here my usual reaction is to decline these requests.   Making me wonder what I had to say on the 10M DAI reimbursement.   But I am pretty sure my comments were very similar even though I voted yes to reimburse there. ",
