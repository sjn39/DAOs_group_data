The opportunity allowed us to explain a detailed overview of the process and the outcome of our work. Your positive feedback during the call is very much appreciated. Revamping the current website has been long overdue. Our motivation was to create a fresh-looking, more up-to-date website and  Present all the key information coherently and in an organised manner Bring more commercial focus to the design and content of our website Create brand identities for the products offered by MakerDAO Help onboard more people to the community and the ecosystem And establish clear visual guidelines and TOV to use across all MakerDAO design and comms  [VIDEO LINK TO BE UPDATED WHEN GOVALPHA PUBLISHES] This forum post aims to summarize what we discussed during the G&R call on the output,  The new MakerDAO website design The brand guidelines The TOV guideline.  We welcome your suggestions on further website content required to complete and officially launch the website.  The Process\u2014Workshop & Resources  We worked with an agency called Deepwork Studios to help design the website. Our collaboration with DeepWork studios to develop the new MakerDAO website and refresh the Brand Guidelines included dynamic and interactive workshops. A lot of work went into these workshops, and it is impossible to describe them all in one post. To help get a feel for how we carried out the work, please see below the summary of the workshop here,  Session #1 Session #2 Session #3 Session #4  Here are the key points we addressed during these workshops with their respective outcome:  Branding and Landing Workshops. Interation Sprint. Protocol Health Page   Deliverable #1\u2014MakerDAO Brand Guidelines   image2000\u00d71125 81.5 KB  To successfully revamp the official MakerDAO website and create effective visual and communicative assets, we must first define our brand\u2019s mood and the communication goal. Therefore, our first deliverable is a completed extension of MakerDAO\u2019s Brand Guidelines. With new refreshed Brand Guidelines, we ensure that all future assets align with our unique identity, conveying the same values and overcoming the problem of fragmented MakerDAO\u2019s branded materials by moving from scattered to connected information. In a nutshell, by taking the previous branding guidelines as a basis, our work completed the identity of MakerDAO by identifying new guidelines, adding a new family of logos for all MakerDAO products, expanding the color palette, setting specific typography, creating base illustrations, and defining a tone of voice for communications.  Deliverable #2\u2014MakerDAO Website Revamp   image1920\u00d71524 71.6 KB  With our brand mood defined, we concentrated on revamping MakerDAO\u2019s internet front door: the official MakerDAO website. From workshops and user testing to designing and implementing, our work focused on the following priorities:  Provide an up-to-date commercial overview of MakerDAO and present the Maker Protocol as a decentralized tech stack with a suite of sub-products that leverage the main product: The DAI stablecoin. Convey transparency, stability, and security by visualising all assets across the pages. Provide easy-to-digest and straightforward information with simple terminology and benefit-focused narratives. Highlight the relevance of Make Protocol\u2019s metrics within the industry it forms part of through straightforward metrics. Ensure users understand what controls the Maker Protocol, and DAI, is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization called MakerDAO through on-chain voting and open participation. Facilitate ways to frictionlessly get in touch with MakerDAO and Core Units according to each user\u2019s needs.  As we move closer to the website launch, we will continue to seek your input and feedback, and we encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas with us.  Community Feedback   image2000\u00d71293 139 KB  We\u2019ve accomplished great milestones, but there\u2019s still more to do. To help build the MakerDAO website, we need your input to create informative pages explaining our community\u2019s beneficial aspects, products, and purposes. Our request to you is simple. Choose one or more pages you\u2019re interested in and have knowledge about and provide us with your ideas about what you think the content of your selected page(s) should be:  Product suite: All MakerDAO-specific product descriptions.  DAI page Maker Vaults page D3M page PSM page Maker Teleport page RWA page DSR page    Ecosystem page: All third-party players, the Maker Protocol and DAI are integrated with to showcase the wide and relevant MakerDAO presence within the industry.  DAO page: An overview of why MakerDAO is a decentralized organization, how its processes sustain the Maker Protocol and DAI, and how to participate.  Developers page: An overview of all explanatory information and a list of resources a developer would need to start working on top of Maker or with MakerDAO.  Use cases page: The most important use cases of DAI and the protocol\u2019s product suite  We\u2019ve created a sitemap that includes all possible content and aspect we can address. This is a fairly exhaustive list; however, to keep the website simple and accessible, we will try to focus on the important bits not to overwhelm users. Please use the links provided in the post to go through the dummy site, read through the content sitemap, review and brand guidelines and let us know your feedback, more specifically for what content we could include them in the pages. This feedback period closes on Friday, March 10th at 11:59 PM UTC time. Looking forward to the community input! ",

                    "content": "I don\u2019t envy anyone who has to build and design a new brand and website for a DAO - a lot of challenges am I sure. With that said here is some feedback from me: 1 The homepage hero lacks direction. The homepage should serve the widest audience. It\u2019s people\u2019s first touch point with Maker. With that in mind, what is the most important thing to convey to a new user? Imo it\u2019s DAI. DAI is Maker\u2019s product and the main goal of the homepage should be to onboard users into DAI. The challenge is that there are so many directions you can go down as maker is infinitely complex but a dominate focus on the main product is the best approach for onboarding new people. 2 The brand guidelines are too complex If the purpose of the brand guidelines is to be used by a wide audience of community members, core units, and ecosystem companies then they need to be brutally simple. The more complex the more you\u2019ll alienate people from using them. This is why we kept it painfully simple for the first version - not saying that they shouldn\u2019t evolve but think the simplest deliverable would be the most useful. Think of Bitcoin, arguably the most successful decentralized brand, and its 2 things a B and orange. Nothing else. Good read on Headless Brands 3 attention to detail smaller point, but some parts of the website are low res (the main image is super pixelated) and graphics are miss-aligned. anyway just my thoughts some of which may be outdated, GL  ",

                    "content": "I have feedback on a few areas here. I suspect most of my feedback is going to be focused around \u2018areas for improvement\u2019. Despite the negative content, please be aware that I\u2019m extremely glad someone is owning and working on the website. I\u2019ll try to provide useful feedback that you actually asked for with the content stuff as well. Please let me know if there is anything else you think I can help with.   The Product Logos  Put bluntly, I don\u2019t think these are very good. I\u2019ll try to explain why I think that, but a lot of it is intuitive rather than reasoned, so bear with me.  Many of these have very little resemblance to object or concept to which they refer. I\u2019m aware that this is extremely difficult with concepts as abstract as these, but I still believe there is room for improvement. Good icons have a conceptual link to the thing they represent. These largely don\u2019t. Following from point 1, the icons are not sufficiently differentiated. I would expect people to mix these up in absence of the identifying label.  More specifically, here\u2019s feedback on them individually. Maker Vaults - One of the better ones in terms of having that conceptual link. However, even that feels tenuous due to the decision to represent the \u2018vault wheel\u2019 on what would be the corner the cube. It took me far too long to realize this was supposed to be a vault because of that. D3M - I can\u2019t see any conceptual link here, and that\u2019s an extremely bad sign, because I\u2019m extremely familiar with the D3M product and how it works. The icon make me think of a butterfly? I have no idea how that connects to a D3M. My second thought was that maybe it\u2019s meant to represent protocols as pieces of paper, which are folded together? Just seems bad that I can\u2019t figure that out. PSM - Again, can\u2019t see a conceptual link, the first thing this icon makes me think of is a roller coaster? I think? Like its so abstract that I can\u2019t really connect it to anything. Is it meant to be the letters \u2018P\u2019 \u2018S\u2019 \u2018M\u2019 sort of folded around each other? I feel like I can half-see all three, but not strongly enough to be meaningful. Teleport - Eh, kinda has a conceptual link to motion at least, this is better than the others, and is something I would view as \u2018okay\u2019. Certainly not a great icon though. It stands out as maybe one of the better ones here. DSR - It\u2019s a box? I don\u2019t get it. Again, no conceptual link that I can identify. Yep, don\u2019t know what else to say about this one. It\u2019s just a random icon assigned to DSR to me. RWA - Again, it just seems like a squiggle in green. If there\u2019s a conceptual link, I don\u2019t see it. Maybe it\u2019s meant to be bricks? if I squint slightly I can kind of see it. It\u2019s definitely not something that comes quickly to mind though. To really drive home what I\u2019m getting at here. Imagine that you presented these icons to a focus group that has not yet seen them. (either of Maker people or random crypto people, or even strangers.) How many of a group of ten do you think could correctly match up the icons to their respective labels? I will bet that none would get all of them correct. I think Vault and Teleport might be right more often than not. The others are a complete toss-up.   The Hero Illustration I don\u2019t particularly like the hero illustration. It kind of just looks amateurish, imo. Like 3d objects are vaguely interesting, but the rendering choice is too close to \u2018trying to be realistic\u2019 without actually looking realistic. It\u2019s kind of like its in the uncanny valley but for rendering. It looks like its trying to be real, but failing. Also, the composition seems pretty arbitrary. I\u2019m aware that you\u2019re trying to convey transparency and openness. In practice though, it looks like DAI alongside a lot of useless widgets, which feels like the opposite of the message we want to send. I\u2019m aware that we\u2019ve used similar images from time to time as banners for calls and such on threads in the forum. Particularly the meet your delegate calls. In the context of a forum, I think its a reasonably charming style. On the website though, I don\u2019t think it has the gravitas or impact we really want. Like compare to some alternative frontpages: https://aave.com/, https://compound.finance/, https://uniswap.org/ Again, I\u2019m struggling to put reasoning on something that is an intuitive conclusion, but I really don\u2019t think the proposed illustration competes favourably with those alternatives. (On a minor sidenote, I like the DAO illustration quite a bit. I think it\u2019s elegant, I would legitimately prefer to see that on the splash page(although please modify it so that the labels are actually unique, rather than repeating things.)   Website design Some general comments on the design + composition.  Everything feels too large on the main page. It\u2019s both an inefficient use of space, and makes it feel more like money duplos versus legos. Like, if I zoom chrome to 75%, it feels much better immediately (with the exception of the horizontal menu at the top, that should remain roughly the same size. The structure of the splash page seems okay, with the caveats above. I would perhaps like to see the products visible without scrolling? Or at least slightly higher up? The Maker Ecosystem widget is very cool, I didn\u2019t immediately realize those were all clickable links. Bit sad that the coolest thing on the homepage is directing users to external sites. Its misleading to show the collateralization ratio for DAI at this point. There\u2019s not a good way to communicate correct information around how this works. It\u2019s a bit difficult to judge the product pages with placeholder content, but in general the design seems good. I\u2019m not sure all the pages will need FAQs.    Content As I\u2019ve discussed previously, introductory content for Maker is lacking at the moment. What exists is out of date, and is not hosted on a dedicated frontend. For products:  DAI - Should be mostly focused reliability, safety and ease-of-use of DAI, Specifically on the backing. I would love to see a live breakdown of the collateral backing DAI with a giant pie-chart or somesuch. Should link to in-depth FAQ about DAI. Maker Vaults - I guess the security of vaults? Please include a disclaimer that there is risk involved with using Vaults. D3M - I guess a list of the protocols to which Maker provides DAI credit lines, ideally with updated stats as to how much DAI is being provided, how much can be provided, etc. Something on the benefits to both Maker and the target protocol / subDAO. PSM - Focus on highlighting the aggregators to which the PSMs are built into, making everyone\u2019s swaps more efficient or whatnot. Focus on the massive liquidity it provides for DAI against centralized stables (if this doesn\u2019t provoke regulatory issues in some way.) Teleport - Pass, I\u2019ll leave this to someone else, as I\u2019m less familiar. RWA - Also pass. I guess focus on how Maker can benefit traditional organizations and national economies? DSR - I guess focus on safety, the fact your DAI can be accessed at any time, etc.  For the DAO page (assuming endgame passes), focus on the constitution, the scopes, the safety features of the DAO. Maybe highlight that it\u2019s one of the oldest DAO\u2019s at this point? Having been managing the protocol for however-long-it-is.  As a final note, this sentence worries me a little:     MakerGrowth:  Please use the links provided in the post to go through the dummy site, read through the content sitemap, review and brand guidelines and let us know your feedback, more specifically for what content we could include them in the pages.   It worries me because it communicates that you\u2019ve built the structure for the site without considering the content too deeply in advance. Like, in an ideal world you don\u2019t create a cool structure and then look for relevant things with which to fill the structure. Instead, you should determine what key pieces of information and content you want to convey, and the relative priorities they have, and then build your structure to deliver your content. ",

Working in the open can be very confronting, but I believe this can lead to greater results. I concur the above given feedback and would like to provide a few additional points. Sorry if any of this is already replied to in the governance call, as I didn\u2019t join it.     MakerGrowth:  Provide an up-to-date commercial overview of MakerDAO and present the Maker Protocol as a decentralized tech stack with a suite of sub-products that leverage the main product: The DAI stablecoin.   Kudos for this being the highest priority, as I think that this makes a lot of sense for the main website for makerdao. The following suggestions are trying to improve on this priority:  The current site proposal doesn\u2019t come over to me as portraying MakerDAO as the number 1 DeFi protocol. Perhaps sharing some achievements could be helpful. MakerDAO is miles ahead of most other DeFi protocols in many areas. People look at Maker\u2019s Risk team as a thought leader. The live and transparant view of Maker\u2019s finances are unique. The ambition and pioneering of MakerDAO\u2019s real world asset portfolio is unmatched. The continuous prioritization of security of both oracles and smart contracts causes Maker to be the number one trusted lending protocol. I\u2019d suggest to spotlight these values more clearly from the main page. Dai itself has saved people\u2019s lives (quoting a team member of yours), especially in non western countries. With all the negative news going around in DeFi, these types of accomplishments can be forgotten. As Dai is the main product, showcasing this more makes sense to me. Who are you/MakerDAO trying to sell what to? The site right now feels quite product focused and not really user/customer focused. Based on the post it looks like you have thought about the customers quite a bit. As there seem to be quite a few distinct customer segments, it seems worth it to propertize them (based on strategy or revenue), such that the content doesn\u2019t become too generic. Some suggestions for the products/customer segments that are the highest revenue drivers for maker.   Vaults - Why would a user open a Vault? Two main use cases are (1) getting cheap liquidity, and (2) getting extra exposure to collateral. Starting from the use case and only then diving into the product, is easier for new users to understand. PSM deals. Who are the customers here? The people swapping on the PSM, or the people paying maker to keep stables in the PSM? Assuming the second: what can a stablecoin provider do to be included in the PSM? How can they come in contact to start to arrange a deal? RWA: what is the reason for a high quality RWA to come to maker? Is the focus clean money? Based on those questions I would expect copy and a tailored page for high quality RWA to start reaching out to maker. Getting a big loan at or below fed rate is a huge unique selling point.  Ecosystem partners: Please take into account I\u2019m working for oasis.app, so the following comment may be biased. Structuring the partners to give them all equal exposure doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. The link to Aave and compound are probably net negative revenue, whilst defisaver, instadapp, and (yes I know) oasis.app, are big drivers for maker\u2019s revenue. Maybe it was your plan to link to relevant partners at relevant products, but as the main landing page is a prime location, I don\u2019t understand the choice for these partners. Is the goal for this website to be a one time release, or will the team actively maintain the website? Assuming the latter, it probably makes sense to just go live with it once you feel it is at least a bit better than the current website and iterate on it. After a few responses, the best feedback that you\u2019ll get is live usage data. If you would like to do some user testing of the website, I\u2019d be happy to help, although I\u2019m not sure if I personally fit in any of the customer segments. ",
