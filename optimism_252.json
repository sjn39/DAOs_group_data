A majority of comments were around this topic. Added clarification around potential future incentives from Alchemix (via migrating CRV / CVX bribes from mainnet to veVELO on Optimism). Reduce total ask to 250k and reduce total time to 6 months to meet defi committee recomendation.

User collateral is deposited into underlying yield strategies, and yield earned is used to pay down user debt. Because liquidation is not possible and the primary interaction is front-loaded (deposit and take initial loan), Alchemix depositors are far stickier TVL than other forms of DeFi yield farming, which means that users that come to Alchemix on Optimism are likely to remain.

Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes, the Alchemix front end and smart contracts are open source. Optimism native?: Alchemix has deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Fantom. Deployment date: Deployed Sept 28th, via AIP-62. Vaults can be viewed here: Alchemix Deposit caps are limited to 100k / 100 ETH for the first week.  Ecosystem Value Proposition: (200 words) Many DeFi protocols are built around DeFi power users. Alchemix is a tool that benefits power users, as well as users that wish to remain minimally active, or route real-world finances and spending through DeFi as an alternative to traditional means. We are passionate about providing DeFi users a safe way to gain capital efficiency on their assets, and believe users should be able to do so in a cheap environment without having to sacrifice Ethereum\u2019s security. Alchemix is built on external yield solutions, so assets deposited will contribute to increasing TVL of other protocols throughout the Optimism ecosystem. This TVL is not just vanity or temporary - the proven use case of Alchemix will drive additional actual usage and fee revenue to integrated protocols (at first, AAVE and Velodrome). At the time of writing Alchemix is responsible for 46% of the liquidity in the yvDAI vault and 26% of the yvWETH vault on Yearn. Furthermore, the liquidity demands of providing synthetic asset redeemability will greatly increase TVL of AMMs we partner with. Alchemix is responsible for ~122m of combined alUSD3CRV and alUSDFBP liquidity, and ~56m of alETHCRV liquidity in mainnet Curve, which is ~3% of Curve\u2019s total (all chains) TVL. Alchemix also owns a locked veVELO position that has built up $2.9m of incentivized liquidity on Velodrome, between alETH and alUSD pairs. Alchemix has also (as of Sept 14th) accumulated additional VELO as well as migrated a portion of protocol owned alETH liquidity to Velodrome per AIP-59. Alchemix has also recently acquired a veSDL position and is pursuing ways to incentivize liquidity on Optimism thru Saddle. Even before the impact of veSDl and AIP-59, Optimism is already Alchemix\u2019s largest home for alAsset liquidity, aside from mainnet Ethereum. Finally, Alchemix believes public goods are good, and contributed $100,000 total to Gitcoin Grants in rounds #13 and #15. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives?  We are primarily matching incentives on the liquidity side of the Alchemix system, as that is where incentives are typically needed most. Since the passing and execution of AIP-59 Alchemix has over 6.5 million veVELO power and $1m of protocol-owned alETH liquidity farming on Velodrome. Should the deposit caps on Optimistic Alchemix quickly fill, that will be indicative to Alchemix that we should look to re-allocate some bribes from CRV/CVX on mainnet to veVELO on Optimism to further scale the deployment.  Per the token distribution below, the incentives are expected to create more demand on the TVL side than the demand side (partially because this TVL is stickier and therefore more desireable). As deposits grow, more liquidity will be necessary than what our current incentives + VELO grant can provide. Alchemix can redirect emissions, including from CRV/CVX bribes on mainnet, to meet this liquidity demand Based on a target alAsset liquidity of at least 1/2 of TVL on Optimism, bribes worth approximately 500k OP (paid in ALCX) would be necessary to direct to Velodrome The end result is that Alchemix is providing incentives to make Optimistic Alchemix feasible for launch, Optimism provides incentives start the growth, and then we can step in with more incentives to sustain the growth.     Proposal For Token Distribution How will the OP tokens be distributed?   50% (125,000) will incentivize vault depositors in the form of boosted yield, for 6 months, split between alETH and alUSD. Estimated to incentivize $25m of deposits (at an approximated market-determined boost of 1% APR on AAVE strategies)  50% (125,000) will incentivize LP providers on Velodrome through bribes, for 6 months, split between alETH and alUSD. Estimated $3m additional liquidity at 10% APR (Alchemix currently incentivizes $2.5m of liquidity on Velodrome) No tokens at any point would be delegated or self-delegated  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Tokens used for velodrome bribes will be distributed over the course of 6 months. Tokens used for depositor boosted yield will be distributed over the course of 6 months.  Trackable Milestones / KPIs Alchemix is inherently good and positive-sum for Optimism, for the following reasons:  Alchemix is an attractive DeFi offering due to the reduced risk that comes with not having to worry about liquidations. Because it is built on other yield providers it will simultaneously increase TVL in integrated partners such as AAVE (our initial planned Optimism vault offering) as well. Based on V1 and V2 yearn vault statistics, we would expect at least 25% of AAVE Optimism TVL in aWETH and stablecoins to migrate to Optimistic Alchemix. (note that some DeFi trackers may double-count this TVL between AAVE and Alchemix while some may subtract the TVL from Alchemix or AAVE). Alchemix TVL is inherently sticky, even if alAsset liquidity incentives reduce. This effect is demonstrated by the fact that currently, with no direct incentive to migrate from v1 to v2, AND with globally reducing DeFi yields and liquidity, half of deposits still remain with v1 compared to v2 (note: v1 is being retired October 1st). There is currently $26m of TVL in V1 and $26m of TVL in V2. Systematically, users can only exit vaults through repaying their debt themselves, waiting for automatic yield repayments to repay their debt, or via self-liquidation (which allows exiting with [collateral] - [debt] of user\u2019s deposit). Because of the fact that there is no liquidation risk, there is no penalty for continuous max borrowing, and so the incentive for users is to continue to leverage the time value of money by maximizing their debt at all times. Self-liquidations reduce total underlying collateral earning yield and are therefore undesirable for the user in many cases. In a scenario where the user has max-borrowed, self-liquidating would reduce their capital that is earning yield by 50%, which means the users would have to find a yield source greater than twice that of the underlying Alchemix vault for them to consider leaving. Together these factors create long-lasting and sticky TVL in Alchemix vaults and underlying integrated vault partners. The liquidity requirements for ensuring redeemability of synthetic assets for the underlying assets they represent creates a need to incentivize liquidity in alAsset pools. The yield created by these incentives will drive more LPers to increase TVL of partnering AMMs on Optimism. We expect deposit TVL to increase with liquidity, and in periods of decrease  liquidity we expect deposit TVL to decrease at a slower rate.  By integrating with yield providers such as AAVE, we will be farming OP rewards on underlying vaults as well, which will be passed on to depositors in the form of boosted yield. The presence of liquidity on both Optimism and Mainnet, with a large influx of new users on Optimism will create arbitrage opportunities that will drive volume to Optimism bridges and Velodrome. For example - $10m of migrated TVL to Optimism would create $10m of initial bridge volume, $5m of alAsset selling volume, and additional arbitrage volume (on both exchanges and bridges) between mainnet and optimism during the period of higher demand to sell alAssets.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  The OP incentives are going to immediately grow the Optimism Ecosystem, as is typically expected from liquidity mining incentives. The real test is if this creates new long term users and TVL. Due to both our veVELO growth plan (see two points below) as well as the aforementioned stickiness of Alchemix deposits, this TVL has a much greater retention rate than many other forms of DeFi protocols. Alchemix will be able to launch stETH strategies on Optimism once staked ETH unlocks are possible. Additionally, Alchemix will be able to integrate any mainnet strategy that also launches on Optimism (for example, Yearn strategies are planned for deployment as soon as they are scaled up on Optimism). Lastly, Optimism has numerous unique DeFi protocols that could offer yield strategies not available on mainnet (and offers grants to protocols willing to write their own yield adapters!). Many users will prefer the cheaper fees of Optimistic Alchemix and will continue to migrate as the feature set becomes more identical to mainnet. With the increased demand will come increased need for liquidity. Alchemix is currently farming VELO through protocol owned alETH liquidity, which will be constantly claimed and locked to create an ever-growing stack of veVELO by which to incentivize liquidity. Additionally, Alchemix has plans to launch a Velodrome alAsset AMO (Similar to the mainnet Curve AMO) that would be able to deposit and farm VELO with excess transmuter funds (and withdraw and burn alAssets when needed to increase price), thus increasing the available alAsset liquidity, alAsset price control tools, and profitability of Optimistic Alchemix. Lastly, Alchemix can re-direct mainnet liquidity driving assets to Optimism if demand is more present there (CVX, CRV, SDL, TOKE).  ",

Although there are no standards on this point, my suggestion is that you fold the tokens to be delegated into one of your other asks \u2013 or to consider something creative with the OP that you would hold, e.g., devise some utility within Alchemix\u2019s core offerings. You could then draw down the delegatable OP over time, reacquiring it through market buys should you decide that governance power is something you\u2019d wish to accumulate over the long term (and I candidly think it is!) Separately, I\u2019m not sure how to get around the KYC issue, and it\u2019s probably worth some discussion. One thing we could do is arrange for a multisig with some KYC\u2019d people on it and set it such that you need at least one KYC\u2019d person signing off on any tx. ",

No one on the team has KYC\u2019d before, and we have done plenty of deals without it, including an OTC sale of ALCX tokens shortly after the protocol launched. I believe KYC would be off the table for us, but we are open to other approaches if acceptable.   We have deployed the contracts with small (100k) deposit caps. Currently we are working on completing staging for the UI with the live contracts, then we will announce and lift the caps. So there\u2019s not really any stats yet (unless anyone wants to interact with the contracts directly, if they can find them!).   See my comment above yours - we could hold onto the OP for an eventual alOP. Alternatively, since I\u2019d like to keep the total quantity the same, we could put the 250k OP into the LP/depositor incentives and self-delegate over the course of time that we are drawing down from those.   Who would be good to ask about KYC? Ultimately is it just a DAO decision? Ie, we would go to vote with a \u201cno\u201d for KYC, and then the DAO could pass or fail it? ",

As mentioned we would be holding for up to a year with the hopes of incentivizing alOP in the future (requires some updates on the OP side, and we are working on an update that would make launching separate alAssets feasible). If that use case never comes to fruition then after a year, we would fold the OP into the first two use cases, to extend their life. In the meantime, we were thinking we would delegate OP. In this scenario if we want a voice in governance beyond a year we would still have to purchase OP, but at least it gives us some say while we build up the funds / TVL to justify doing so. We also figured delegating/voting would be better than LPing the tokens somewhere (ALCX/OP or something), since that\u2019s effectively a limit-sell order on OP if it goes up, but if LPing those tokens would be more preferable we can do that. Lastly, if more people voice concerns with delegation or LPing (hard for me to know if your opinion reflects a large portion of voters / past precedent in voting - if you have any insight there please let me know), then we can just fold those OP tokens into the first two use cases.

For KYC, I\u2019ve gotten a few different answers, still none with absolute clarity. Most recently, from talking with some folks on the Optimism legal side of things, it seemed like our entire multisig may need to KYC which isn\u2019t really feasible, but the wording was not clear. Waiting to hear back. I think it may be easier to just go to vote, with the intent to try to meet the KYC requirements, and if for some reason we can\u2019t, we would just have to pull out of the grant.  Relatively liquidity seems sticky, from peak of 800M to 62M as of writing but this might be because of current market condition.  Sorry, are you saying liquidity is sticky or isn\u2019t here? And yes collapsing defi yields / less TVL in defi as a whole in general are the biggest factor, yearn was something like 40% APR when Alchemix launched. Liquidity is definitely mercenary to incentives though, whereas a depositor only needs liquidity for their initial loan, then a future re-up of their loan a while later.  would you consider waiting for one more cycle ? this will give us time to see how your OP deployment is received by community.  I think that could make sense, depending on when we are able to officially launch. But if we launch soon and TVL fills up quickly, it may not matter as much. Is their precedent for going to a vote, failing the vote, and then re-applying with modifications in the next cycle?  This is also something to consider, if you are only going to use the token next year why not submit another proposal when you are ready next year ? Distributing OP from grant to sit in another wallet is not a good use imo.  With what we know now about delegation and how it is perceived, this probably makes more sense. We will likely update to split the tokens 50/50 and remove use case #3. I\u2019m going to let more feedback continue to roll in since we have the time, as well as stats once we launch, then make the changes in one revision/revision narrative.  is this already deployed to OP chain ? How can i verify this ?  I believe so, let me track that down and follow up.

Ov3rkoalafied:  Alchemix is currently farming VELO through protocol owned alETH liquidity, which will be constantly claimed and locked to create an ever-growing stack of veVELO by which to incentivize liquidity   Few additional points:- I see you have one year distribution plan, could you provide some information on your plan. Will it done weekly /bi-weekly and is there a cap on max number of token distributed weekly ? and how this will help with long term liquidity ? Do you mean bribing on velo with your voting power ? I am trying to understand the co-incentives and long term plan here. Would you consider matching co-incentives with your native token ? Apologies for many question here but there was some communication gap in last voting cycle and i want to make sure i have my doubt clear before we reach next voting round.     Ov3rkoalafied:  Is their precedent for going to a vote, failing the vote, and then re-applying with modifications in the next cycle?

With their criteria formed by a group of delegates. The proposers adapt the comments to what they feel is necessary and within the recommendations of the members and the committee. The approval of the next phases does not depend exclusively on the delegates who are members of the committee. Other delegates can and have already done so. Personal opinion: For me self-delegation is not applicable, BUT if there is a proposal that convinces me that self-delegation in that proposal should be approved I will agree. In this particular case if Alchemix makes a long term bet on Optimim it can buy the token in the same way it did with the VELO token. Lastly I think proposals that want to include self-delegation have every right to do so, the snapshot vote is the final decision. ",

As I said before and say again now I am not in favor of self-delegation, but if there is a superseded proposal it would be something to assess and subsequently be in favor in that particular case. Finally I have given my reasons why I do not see this self-delegation as positive. And as I have said other times it is my point of view.

Self-delegation of token grants can lead to centralization or secret agreements between projects-protocols and delegates to delegate tokens in exchange for votes/grants.

The routes to collusion are many and don\u2019t require a lick of self-delegation. You want to know how to avoid centralization and kneecap collusion? Get more stakeholders in the game. Right now the distribution of votes is more or less fixed since the airdrop, and the only distribution of OP is to protocols, which are doing nothing with them until doling out 60% of their granted tokens (realistically closer to 100% initially given the speed of liq mining relative to other uses) to the likes of stablecoin farmers to be dumped into LPs, again doing nothing. So there are likely few marginal delegators (the # of delegated tokens has consistently decreased, even as circulating supply has increased), and the same centralization concerns persist until the next marquee OP airdrop, which may or may not improve the distribution. Show projects, partners, builders what it means to get into governance and take part in assembling the collective, to tangle over heady ideas about coordination and incentivization, to cooperate and compete, and you start to see the decentralization we all want here. That\u2019s all to say that i think allowing some measure of self-delegation in fact hastens decentralization, and what\u2019s more, you get a bunch more voices in the forums. I urge you to be more open-minded here, both about the risks of centralization and about the benefits of letting broader inclusion breathe. ",

Asking for support in your community is a good start and has a cost of $0 as well as appointing a delegate to represent Alchemix\u2019s interests. In the event that the proposal is not voted YES, will Alchemix still be interested in governance as one of the protocols they seek to develop in the network? Self-delegation with token grants is the same thing @jackanorak complains about from users. What I don\u2019t see in the protocols being pushed by @jackanorak  for self-delegation is at least minimal participation beyond his own proposals. ",

So I appreciate all your insight. And yes - even without being given an initial say, Optimism is still very interesting to us as a long-term deployment. Obviously the potential for incentives led to us narrowing down to Optimism as our next L2 launch, but we passed on numerous other chains that reached out to offer significant incentives to deploy on them. And quite frankly I think the incentives just made us prioritize dev time - it was already shaping up to be our next launch without incentives because the team already liked what Optimism was doing and it\u2019s one of the first EVM L2 with the right DeFi ecosystem (which is a good sign for future growth). As mentioned I\"m going to do a deeper dive into delegation and watch the other thread for discussion, then revise the proposal either with a more detailed delegation ask or with it removed, leaving at least a couple more days for community feedback. Ultimately the delegation is not our primary goal for the proposal. ",

Alchemix is one of the protocols that really highlight interesting use cases enabled by DeFi with their self-repaying non liquidation loans. Overall, well written proposal that highlights both Alchemix ecosystem value proposition and its values to contribute to public goods through Gitcoin. I will echo previous feedback from other commentators:  I encourage you to reconsider the amount you are requesting for your future alOP integration. Since this is still in the pipeline of possibilities like you mention, you can always come back to request this amount in another proposal once the integration is live and have some traction. This integration is interesting for Optimism and will bring lots of value. At the current state, your total requested value amount is sitting around x8 the protocol deposits on Optimism (since you have just recently deployed). The expectation is that the amount requested would somehow match your protocols deposits. I believe your proposal have a higher chance of getting through if you lower your ask and your timeframe from 1 year, or wait until you show some more traction for another cycle.   Should the deposit caps on Optimistic Alchemix quickly fill, that will be indicative to Alchemix that we should look to re-allocate some bribes from CRV/CVX on mainnet to veVELO on Optimism to further scale the deployment.   can you clarify exactly when and how much of rellocation to from CRV/CVX bribes on mainnet?  Overall, I am in support of this proposal as Alchemix has a unique proposition to Optimism in terms of its innovative mechanism in DeFi. ",

                    "content": "Hello! A few updates related to this comment/others here:  I\u2019ve entirely removed our ask for future alOP / self delegation. While it appears self delegation could be acceptable, it isn\u2019t the primary reason we applied for the grant and it makes sense that a future use case could be addressed with a future grant. Looking at some other protocol asks, I\u2019ve reduced the total ask from 750,000 to 500,000 (ie, the tokens that were being asked for for self delegation were completely removed, rather than reidistributed). I updated a few statistics here and there just to reflect the present day #delegate-updates   I do want to note that The \u201ctotal requested based on current TVL\u201d feels a bit backwards to me. Isn\u2019t the point of OP grants to incentivize TVL and genuine defi activity on Optimism? I think our (reduced) ask is fair for these reasons:  we have a proven use case on mainnet, being live for a year and a half, and the quality defi / low gas environment of optimism strengthens the use case without needing users to sacrifice their loyalty to ethereum We\u2019ve explained that TVL is rather sticky so incentives are necessary to get people to migrate to try out Optimistic Alchemix Without an OP grant, users are less likely to use Optimistic Alchemix, as they could use another protocol that gives them OP incentives (which would then put Alchemix on uneven footing where our utility needs to overcome their straight financial incentive)  it\u2019s a bit of a chicken & egg scenario, where we need a grant to prove we deserve the grant, but I believe the points above + the reduce total amount (from eliminating the delegated tokens) addresses the concerns. This also means we aren\u2019t requesting dev or DAO funds - every OP token we get will go into the hands of those bringing TVL to Optimism through Alchemix / Alchemix partners. For CVX/CRV bribes, it will be dependent on alAsset peg. As seen in the proposal it\u2019s expected that the incentives bring more TVL to depositors than to liquidity (which is good, as that TVL is stickier). This also means that if we hit our TVL expectations, we will need more liquidity on Optimism. A clear sign of need would be either high TVL or lower alAsset peg on Optimism. Usually liquidity equivalent to half of TVL is sufficient / a good target. So - if we meet our goal of >30m TVL, we\u2019d need ~15m of liquidity. The incentives we have asked for in theory put us at 30m TVL, and 5m of liquidity. The liquidity comes from 250k OP tokens plus our VELO position. So we\u2019d effectively need to provide another effective 500k+ of OP (in the form of ALCX) get up to the required liquidity. Which happens to be the grant we requested (that actually wasn\u2019t intentional haha). So effectively, the way the proposal is set up is that we are providing the incentives to make Optimistic Alchemix feasible for launch, Optimism provides incentives start the growth, and then we can step in with more incentives to sustain the growth.

One of the core purposes of the gov fund is to migrate protocols that have demonstrated PMF elsewhere, and Alchemix clearly fits this bill, even if it has yet to hit its \u2018full\u2019 numbers on Optimism. This isn\u2019t to say TVL isn\u2019t irrelevant \u2013 it is a fine enough (but messy and manipulable) proxy for use, utility, and market acceptance \u2013 but there\u2019s a risk in using it as a crutch as we have. Part of it is that it\u2019s an easy thing to point to relative to other metrics, which is why we ought to be asking more from protocols in furnishing use data and perhaps pointing delegates to known resources on our end to help evaluate.

We broadly support Alchemix\u2019s proposal as written but advise halving their ask generally by time and size \u2013 there\u2019s simply no good argument for running a grant past six months, and even that amount of time is a stretch. They\u2019re in the minority of proposals to date that have offered a bottom-up approach in outlining the size of their ask and explaining the additionality of the grant, and we\u2019re inclined to agree with their view. Another key piece is that Alchemix\u2019s proposal is rare in that they are explicitly committing to move resources over to Optimism themselves \u2014 that is, they\u2019re not just trying to draw users and capital, they\u2019re moving the deployment of their own capital to encourage more use on Optimism. This goes beyond the simple idea of \u201cincentive matching\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection that a grant can beget follow-on activity, and it\u2019s exactly the kind of behavior we should be encouraging. We think there is still some work to be done to determine KPIs, demonstrate migration from Mainnet, and discuss potential integrations with other ecosystem protocols, but these are nits in an otherwise well-presented proposal that seems advantageous for Optimism.
