                    "content": " [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Saddle Finance  Incentive Proposal Project Name: Saddle Finance Author Name: Weston Nelson - ENS: westonnelson.eth, Twitter: @westonnelson Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 L2 Recipient Address: Gnosis Safe, 4/7 Multisig on Optimism: 0x2aBD4c0070bc784b7BFD18d947b9d28657070862 Relevant Usage Metrics: For general usage metrics regarding Saddle, please refer to the: Saddle Extended Dashboard on Dune Analytics As well as: DeFi LLama Optimism alignment: Saddle Finance is a decentralized stableswap protocol designed for pegged asset swaps and a team that is deeply aligned with the values of Ethereum and the Optimism Collective. One of Saddle\u2019s core tenets is a commitment to opensource software and this consistent declaration by the team demonstrates how much Public Goods are valued by the Saddle team and community. Core value proposition is to be a leading provider of low slippage trades in pegged assets across multiple chains and be a reliable and trusted platform for many years to come in the DeFi ecosystem. Proposal for token distribution: The OP tokens will ultimately be used to incentivize the adoption of various liquidity pools across the Optimism deployment of Saddle and other potential pools as well, bringing more stablecoins, pegged assets such as $wBTC and $alETH for example, to Optimism\u2019s L2. Saddle is already live on Optimism with 2 liquidity pools, and just yesterday announced a milestone partnership with Frax Finance where the additional deployment of 13 new pools is underway, with 3 of those coming to Optimism. So, attracting liquidity to Optimism is essential and as such the OP token will be used to incentivize ecosystem participants to stake their assets in Saddle\u2019s LPs to earn OP incentives and also the additional incentives from the new $SDL tokenomic upgrade and unlock based largely on models popularized by Curve Finance and Ribbon Finance. How will the OP tokens be distributed? Propose the following distribution of the liquidity mining rewards to begin immediately but also give the team autonomy and flexibility to make changes if need arises due to gauge voting outcomes or new liquidity pools, market dynamics, etc.:  15% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (FRAX, USDC) 15% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (saddleFRAXBP, USDT) 30% $OP - saddleFRAXBP, (saddleFRAXBP, sUSD) [Synthetix] 40% $OP - Pools TBD (sETH/ETH, alETH, ETH, sETH, renBTC/wBTC, etc.)  There is also a mechanism is planned for implementation which is a highly creative, gamified mechanism to utilize the $OP tokens to attract additional TVL and users to Optimism in a swift manner. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Liquidity is highly needed right now on Optimism, and by supporting the Saddle team that is firing on all cylinders; this is an excellent way to signal both Optimism\u2019s commitment to attracting user growth as well as drive real adoption to L2 because of the significant need for another stableswap protocol. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Having deep liquidity on any chain is a critical component of long-term sustainability. These incentives will likely lead to significant TVL growth within the Saddle protocol on Optimism and also other protocols on Optimism as users become more comfortable with the L2 and begin to harvest rewards and engage with other protocols - this is a logical outcome when considering how reliable the UX for Optimism has been and volume and net new users is expected to grow significantly from Saddle\u2019s value it brings to the ecosystem combined with the low cost of interacting on L2. Additionally, this also opens the door to multiple other synergies becoming possible. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The OP tokens allocated will be distributed over a 3 month period, and would start from the date Saddle receives the tokens, they will be added to the pools immediately to incentivize user and TVL growth immediately. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Saddle is in the process of deploying significant incentives as the multi-chain partnership with Frax gets moving and gauge system goes into full effect. These are expecting to continue and adapt to market conditions to continually make sure incentives are best aligned with growing both Saddle and L2 adoption on Optimism.

I do have some thoughts on this though that I hope you might consider - can go deeper and share more details if necessary too if you would find it helpful, but personally, if I had invested in the Fund, I would then of course want you to be voting \u201cFor\u201d; so now throw in this Proposal here, it like automatically puts you in a bit of a pickle no two ways about it!   If we go down the route of any external interests overpowering your influence as a Delegate, I don\u2019t think that is the best path for Optimism because really then it opens the door to almost all Delegates likely having strong arguments made for/against them abstaining in almost all votes\u2026which I just don\u2019t see the best path forward for us all. I think most reasonable people understand this though; but would love to hear other thoughts as well.   With this in mind then, I genuinely don\u2019t see anything wrong - in any capacity - voting for or against something here; in your capacity as a Delegate. As long as the Proposal isn\u2019t clearly malicious; seems reasonable, etc. of course; but beyond that - to me - if the answer is that it passes those standards, my POV would be to vote on the Proposal as you see inclined; without a doubt.   Cheers! Weston  A quick sidenote that is important as well - wanted to get this feedback to the OP team as well as you and @OPUser @Exosphere, other Delegates, one other aspect that I am not sure if it is a bug or what but Abstaining actually seems to hurt Proposals rather than simply doing nothing if I am interpreting Snapshot correctly - so there is some sort of bug; or the Strategy is set incorrectly or something with the Snapshot set up.

I have some questions.         0xWeston:  One of Saddle\u2019s core tenets is a commitment to opensource software and this consistent declaration by the team demonstrates how much Public Goods are valued by the Saddle team and community.   Your contracts are I guess opensource. Is your frontend and all UI code also?  co-incentives: I am not sure I understand. Can you specify in a few sentences what kind of co-incentives you plan to match the amount of 500,000 $OP with? What puts me off the proposal compared to similar proposals is the amount of tokens (half a mil $OP) and the short duration in which to burn them for incentives (3 months). I think it\u2019s too little a time and too many tokens and the minute they dry up the mercenary users will dissapear.  ",

                    "content": "@lefterisjp - excellent questions!!! #1 For me OSS is a huge part of Web3\u2026which is why I personally took notice of Saddle. To answer your question, an emphatic YES!  Here is the Saddle Organization on GitHub and then the specific repositories for the smart contracts that make up the protocol are here and the frontend code here. This is very important to me personally as well. #2 To keep it brief (can go deeper if needed) - co-incentives are essence baked into Saddle\u2019s $SDL emissions based on the mechanics of the $veSDL tokenomic design. It is quite clever in this regard because in order to vote for emissions you must hold and lock $SDL (and thus obtain governance voting power of thing such as emissions) - If there happened to be some freshly launched pools on Optimism that had appealing $OP incentives attached to them; if I put myself in a user\u2019s shoes, and I have the ability to vote for an LP for more emissions of $SDL on any of the chains Saddle is deployed on and the pools available\u2026would $OP incentives impact my decision? 100%; I\u2019d likely come to Optimism. #3 I hear you in this regard - again could be a long answer  but to try and be brief: I believe we will see teams with massive OP allocations end up bringing virtually zero long-term value to Optimism, and many with less end up bringing substantial value. That being said; What I would say to get to the heart of the matter here is that the team at Saddle is quite nimble and this is what is most important; an example for instance: Arbitrum Odyssey is suddenly halted - probably makes sense to come together as a community and redirect incentives/new game plan. With the partnership in place with Frax. By consistently reviewing the effectiveness of the incentives and iterating on their distribution, as well as keeping a close eye to what is happening across the crypto ecosystem, I believe Saddle is as well equipped as any protocol to responsibly and effectively deploy incentives. I hope these answers are helpful to you; and thank you for the questions! Weston ",

Oh yes absolutely; I hope that this has been conveyed clearly that my focus on this Proposal for Saddle is less about setting strict deadlines and more about being able to be nimble and fluid in response to market conditions.   There may be times where it makes sense to pull incentives; there may be times to lay them all on the table; times to adjust emission schedules, etc. I think really we have the ability to gather feedback on what is working/not working so fast now that we don\u2019t need all that much time to pinpoint: \u201chere is what will bring explosive growth to Optimism\u201d Just need a bit of trial and error and all will work out quite well in my personal opinion.   The important part here is that none of it is rigidly set in stone and if you have a qualified team in place than can effectively assess where some targeted incentives will likely attract TVL and Users\u2026this is how you win. Not just Saddle, but Optimism. And that is what gets me pumped up.   I really do appreciate the engagement here btw @OPUser @Exosphere @linda and others\u2026makes me as someone who wants to build on Optimism feel like my voice can be heard and responded to; gives everyone interested in the governance process a first row pass into how it actually works, and overall is helping flesh out details that we can iterate on moving forward to keep staying\u2026 well\u2026      !!!

Their TVL has been ballooning over the last few weeks (even as DeFi TVL has struggled as a whole), so I think giving them OP tokens to get jump started on Optimism is a good idea. I don\u2019t agree with the argument that they don\u2019t deserve this amount of tokens because their Optimism TVL is low, since they are very established on other chains and we are trying to draw some of that TVL to Optimism. Yes, some of that TVL will be transitory, as is to be expected with liquidity incentives, but hopefully much of it will remain on Optimism. Overall this proposal does align with the gov fund phase 1 objectives. ",

I would very much appreciate it if you would read back through the Discord posts I shared and see how the discussion began with 12 months, moving to 6, then 3, to ultimately be the \u201cmost\u201d effective way of having an incentive program best structured to iterate in cooperation and partnership with Optimism - which was done in reality to serve as the opposite of short-term planning; because this opens up more room for iteration along the journey.

The big thing again is the timing aspect - 3 months was decided as a means to iterate and partner in the most effective way possible with OP as opposed to just giving tokens for say an entire year and hoping for the best. Instead; Saddle would have the intent of resubmitting at the end; discuss what went well/didn\u2019t and then iterate on the process and share for all other projects to hopefully benefit from as well! This keeps Saddle accountable to performance and is a win win for everyone.

I\u2019d also take a moment to point out that to give Frax a foothold on Optimism we gifted them a veNFT on our launch, and if they desired they could costlessly direct votes to the USDT pool as well. There is currently roughly $2mm FRAX in our pools, ultimately incentivized at our expense. This means that Saddle would provide no new pools to Optimism under this proposal other than perhaps FRAX/USDT, and we\u2019re already directly incentivizing many of these pools in coordination with the token issuers. Our own sETH/ETH pool, for instance, currently has $2.3mm of liquidity in it, also co-incentivized at our expense. I\u2019m probably too conflicted to make any value judgements regarding this proposal, although I\u2019ve seen others do as much without too much pushback, but I think I\u2019m fine to offer factual context.

I understand your process for coming to 3 months but it is too high of an amount requested for such a short of a time to encourage adoption and might leave you vulnerable to farming mercenaries. If 3 months is your time to iterate, i\u2019d suggest reducing your OP amount. You could request a smaller amount of OP and resubmit at the end of 3-6 months when you have a better idea of what went well. As a community, it seems that a lot of people prefer this path (from what I see in the discussions) Might be worth including all this info in your new submission. Hope this helps. ",

Because Weston has now maligned my character in multiple places and stood himself up as a defender of constructive feedback, I hope nobody minds a brief response to discuss his conflicts in doing so. Here\u2019s Weston, a competitor, unprompted, commenting in response to a governance proposal made by Thales to partner with us:  image1250\u00d7124 23.6 KB   image1284\u00d7339 38.8 KB  Without disclosing his conflicts, he made up wild lies about my team, thinking we weren\u2019t there to defend ourselves, and he couldn\u2019t support any of his claims when we confronted him about them, instead continuing to insult us. I didn\u2019t even know at the time he was at Saddle, and now things make a lot more sense. Here all I did was share inconvenient facts in response to a question. Instead of considering potential means of improving his proposal or offering different sorts of pools that would meet an unmet need on Optimism, more dissembling and unprovoked character attacks. I mentioned Frax because Weston had made leveraging their partnership with Frax to establish them on Optimism central to his case. Simply put, they\u2019re already here, on Velodrome, on Uniswap, and on Perpetual Protocol (as collateral!). I will continue to withhold my thoughts about Saddle\u2019s proposal. Out of respect for people\u2019s attention, I\u2019ll do my best not to respond further here. A final note: I wouldn\u2019t hold myself up as a defender of DeFi and best practices in governance while multiple times trying to convince my VC to abandon her principles and vote for my proposal (much respect, @linda ) as Weston has done here. Shameful. ",

I will echo others and say that you should either increase the duration to something more like 12 months, or if you really need to keep it at 3 months, please reduce the requested amount of OP tokens. 500,000 OP in 3 months is very hard to vote yes on especially with the current TVL on Optimism. Also I would recommend to match the incentives with SDL since this is to incentivize liquidity. I hope to see a revisited proposal from you, and definitely encourage you to take the feedack from the people here to create one. ",
