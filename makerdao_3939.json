Please find the updated simulator here. All existing and prospective Core Units are listed with an associated status, as well as corresponding MKR budgets if applicable. All CU expenses are included in the forecast and P&L calculations. While we are forecasting to finish 2021 at nearly 10x 2020 FY revenue, the rolling 12 month forecast is less favorable. Assuming no change in our assets generating stability fees, we are forecasting $48M in revenue broken down by the following income streams.    Forecast Assumptions: Interest (Stability Fees): maintain stable at current levels Liquidation Fees: Feb - July 2021 average excluding May. In May we saw significant decreases in DAI generated from risk assets with ETH-A vaults alone decreasing nearly $1.2B from peak, corresponding with $4M in liquidation fees. With lower leverage in the system, we expect lower liquidation fees in the near term Trading Fees: July 2021 average - lower PSM outflow fees will generate less trading revenue going forward Opportunities to drive incremental revenue not included in forecast:  Over $3.1B USDC in the PSM that could be invested to earn interest Scaling Real World Assets (NS-DROP $5M DC \u2192 $20M, SolarX $21M, 6S $15M, Treasuries), etc. Investing in DAI Derivatives (i.e. D3M) Leveraged G-UNI Vault Flash Mint Module Institutional vaults, SushiLPs, CropJoin  With the SB buffer approaching $50M, we still have a cushion in the event that downward pressure on rates continue and cash flow turns negative, assuming Liquidations continue in an orderly fashion and we do not incur any bad debt. However, this is quite far below the CET1 (3% - 4.5%) and liquidity ratios recommended by risk and we should avoid drawing down the SB while we remain below these levels (approximately $56M and $160M at a 3% CET1 and liquidity ratio respectively). As a reminder, non-cash expenses reflect the MKR compensation; green highlighted plans have been approved, yellow has had the DAI budget approved, and orange has had neither approved. While these expenses impact Net Income, there is no impact on cash flow. While cash flow is positive, the SB will continue to increase and MKR will continue to be burned at the current approved 75% SB / 25% burn ratio. The model assumes a safe scenario where no MKR is burnt until the SB is above risk targets. As with all models we share, please feel free to download and include your own inputs and assumptions. If you have any questions, please let me know. ",

Aes:  With lower leverage in the system, we expect lower liquidation fees in the near term   The revenue generated from liquidations are great as collateral auctions are more efficient. But it can be shortsighted. Unless we manage to create incentives for further leveraging by tweaking the risk parameters (SF, LR), the system increasingly moves towards greater share of psm or non-revenue generating assets in the near term. Our expenses are only increasing. In theory, RWA collaterals could fill in that revenue gap, but then\u2026     Aes:  With the SB buffer approaching $50M, we still have a cushion in the event that downward pressure on rates continue and cash flow turns negative   For RWA to be able to scale safely into dozens or hundreds of millions, we need a greater provision buffer. In my credit risk opinion, it wouldn\u2019t be wise otherwise. To manage credit risk with a small SB, we may need to put further credit enhancements in RWA collaterals (higher overcollateralisation or equity ratio for e.g.). That\u2019s tricky as it may increase cost of capital for originators, pushing them away, if tradFi is cheaper. We may need to come up with some tactical solutions to increase revenue until we get the SB buffered up or take further credit risks on RWAs. I would rather recommend the former, or at least a combination of both strategies. ",

That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have exponential growth, but we need a plan to get revenues up and diversify our business lines that support DAI. And being cash flow positive is good, but in this case it\u2019s because we are taking on paid-in capital in the form of forgone wages. That\u2019s not fundamentally different (from a profit/loss perspective) from just selling MKR for DAI and using that DAI to pay people. This isn\u2019t an \u201calarm bells\u201d kind of situation. But we need to be pointed in the right direction, because any changes will take time. Our margin of safety is shrinking, so we need to find a way to reverse that. And that won\u2019t happen by whistling past the graveyard. Better to think about this today than in a year or two when perhaps even our cash flow is negative. ",

(Though I have my reservations on the RWA part of the formula we use). To scale RWA safely with the SB, without having to increase our credit enhancement requirements, I think there are a couple of things we need to do:  Setup a clear separation between its use for opEx vs provisions. Have a reasonable 50% ratio at least for provision Define individual and collection provision ratios for individual collateral types and collectively for whole pool of collaterals, respectively. Track that as a KPI Set up a maximum exposure level for any individual collateral as a ratio to the SB part allocated to provision only (point 1) Increase the SB provision part to that cap (point 3).  This would be just the start. I think all of this as KPIs, should we wish to use as both a communication tool to the DAO and one component of our risk appetite. ",
