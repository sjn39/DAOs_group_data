Executive summary Debt Ceiling: $21,000,000 equivalent in Dai (21,200,000 DAI in order to have a buffer) Stability Fees: 5.8% Min SPV CR: 133% Min Vault CR: 100% Min Vault Underlying CR: 133% Liquidation Process: MIP21  Highlights Project A proposal to finance the acquisition of 34 acres of existing farmland located in Mattituck, Suffolk County, New York and the construction of a 10 MW photovoltaic solar farm with associated battery storage (\u201cSolar Farm\u201d).  1600\u00d7834 181 KB   1600\u00d7779 400 KB  Project Co. Solar X Group, Inc. (\u201cSolar X Group\u201d) will form Solar X Group Mattituck, LLC (\u201cProject Co\u201d) to acquire the 34 acres and to own, operate and maintain the Solar Farm. Solar X Group and third party investors (high net worth and businesses and potentially the seller of the 34 acres to ProjectCo) will be the owners of Project Co. These third party investors typically invest in solar and renewable projects to benefit from the federal investment tax credit. Solar X Group will maintain economic and management control over Project Co. The proposal does not contemplate a REIT structure. This will be a direct loan to a single project. Project Co will use the proceeds of the first disbursement ($3,285,000) to purchase the site and undertake 3rd party engineering work and pre-development expenses. (See \u201cImplementation Details\u201d below) Power Purchase Agreement Once Project Co completes the 3rd party engineering work, Project Co will apply for a 20 year power purchase agreement (\u201c\u2018PPA\u201d) with Long Island Electric Utility Servco LLC (\u201cLI ServCo\u201d), acting as agent of and on behalf of the Long Island Power Authority (\u201cLIPA\u201d), which is a corporate municipality and political subdivision of the State of New York. LI ServCo is the buyer under the PPA and LIPA, as principal, has ultimate and full liability for the obligations under the PPA (including payment obligations). LIPA is rated A2 (Stable) by Moody\u2019s and A (Stable) by Standard and Poor\u2019s. https://www.lipower.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LIPA-June-2021-unaudited-financial-statements.pdf PSEG Long Island, a wholly-owned affiliate of Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE: PSEG), has managerial responsibility for the day-to-day operational maintenance of, and capital investment to, the transmission and distribution system owned by LIPA. The PPA will have two tariff rates:   A \u201cFull Requirement Period\u201d rate for the hours of 1 pm to 9 pm on all days.   A \u201cDispatchable Period\u201d rate for all other hours of the day.   Solar X Group anticipates that the \u201cFull Requirement Period\u201d tariff will be between $55.96/MWh to $83.94/MWh. Solar X Group used a conservative $44.77 (a discount of 20% from $55.96/MWh) as an input in its model. Solar X Group anticipates that the \u201cDispatchable Period\u201d tariff will be between $13.99/MWh to $16.49/MWh as of the first half of 2021. Solar X Group used a conservative $13.99/MWh tariff as an input in its model. Solar X Group blended the Full Requirement Period tariff and the Dispatchable Period tariff inputs to arrive at a final tariff rate of $21.69/MWh for purposes of the model. Solar X Group will co-locate 6MW of lithium-ion battery storage to enhance the Solar Farm\u2019s revenue stream. The lithium-ion storage will allow Project Co to store excess electrical energy generated during daytime hours for sale during other parts of the day. The table below shows the annual electricity production (including battery storage) that Solar X Group anticipates Project Co will sell to LI ServCo under the PPA. This includes a degradation factor of three quarters of one percent (0.75%).  Solar Farm Construction Solar X Group anticipates that it will have a construction contract with AECOM. AECOM (NYSE: ACM) is an American multinational engineering company. AECOM\u2019s senior secured bank credit is rated Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and its Corporate Family Rating is Ba2. AECOM has extensive experience in the design, engineering, and construction of hydrocarbon, wind and solar power generation projects.  1459\u00d7978 308 KB  Source: https://www.aecom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/23_ENV_POW_BR_0001_RENEWABLE-ENERGY_8.5x11_email.pdf Specifically, AECOM has helped deliver more than 15 GW of solar projects globally. Solar X Group will engage Koch Engineering to serve as \u201cowner\u2019s engineer\u201d to supervise and advise on matters during the construction of the Solar Farm. The engineering, procurement and construction contract should provide for a standard allocation of risks and mitigations. Solar X Group partners with the Cornell University Department of Engineering to support its environmental management of the project site. Financing MRWA Lending Company, LLC (\u201cMRWA LendCo\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member will be MRWA Foundation Company (\u201cFoundation Co\u201d), a Cayman Islands foundation company, will purchase from Uprets US LLC, an unfunded construction and term loan agreement (\u201cConstruction Loan Agreement\u201d), outstanding principal and interest owed by Project Co under such Construction Loan Agreement, and related collateral security interests (collectively, the \u201cFinancing Agreements\u201d). It is presently expected that MRWA LendCo will receive a true sale opinion from Uprets US LLC\u2019s external legal counsel. The receipt of the true sale opinion will be a key condition precedent to the disbursement of any funds from the escrow account to Project Co (see \u201cImplementation Details\u201d below). The true sale opinion represents a qualified attorney\u2019s conclusion that the transferred financial assets (in this case, the Financing Agreements) have been sold and are beyond the reach of the transferor\u2019s (Uprets US LLC) creditors. MRWA LendCo\u2019s receipt of the true sale opinion is important given the weakened financial condition of Uprets US LLC\u2019s ultimate parent company, Xinyuan Real Estate Co., Ltd. (see \u201cAsset Originator Analysis\u201d below). Upon the acquisition, Uprets US LLC will not retain an interest in the loan or have any further involvement in the finance or the Financing Agreements. MRWA LendCo will be the sole lender to Project Co under the Financing Agreements. The Construction Loan Agreement will provide for the following:  1237\u00d71600 241 KB  1237\u00d71600 68.9 KB  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in two stages: first, from MRWA LendCo into an escrow account at US Bank, and second, in accordance with a defined disbursement schedule, from the escrow account to Project Co. The disbursement schedule will be as follows:   Draw on the Construction Loan Agreement at its execution and fund $21,000,000 into escrow. This amount will accrue interest upon deposit into the escrow account. The $21,000,000 includes a budgeted 12 months of principal and interest (\u201cDebt Service Funds\u201d) that will be used to pay principal and interest on a monthly basis during the construction period.   The Escrow Agent will release funds to Project Co in accordance with the following schedule (subject to other conditions precedent to be negotiated with Solar X):   Month 0 - $3,285,000 to finance a portion of (1) Month 0-3 pre-development expenses and (2) acquisition of the project site ($3,000,000 acquisition cost). MWRA LendCo will have security over existing Project Co assets, which will principally consist of the site (value of $3,000,000).   Month 4 - 50% of remaining funds in escrow (excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds) upon execution of the PPA and issuance of the Notice to Proceed to the EPC contractor.   About Month 6/7 - 25% of remaining funds in escrow excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds) for outstanding construction costs.   Project Completion - 25% of the remaining funds in escrow (excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds).   Solar X has provided an estimated breakdown for the use of funds:  1219\u00d71164 39.4 KB  Solar X Group anticipates a 9 month project schedule, which includes 6 months from the notice to proceed for the construction of the Solar Farm to grid connection and commercial operation. The chart below is indicative as of July 2021.  1600\u00d7791 197 KB   Major risks The Solar X transaction presents a number of risks. Broadly, the risks fall in the following categories:   Risk that PSEG Long Island does not approve Project Co\u2019s PPA application   Construction Risks associated with an unconstructed solar farm   Operational risks associated with the operation of the Solar Farm   Loan administration risks   Single Project Concentration Risk   Environmental Concerns   Project Co\u2019s PPA Application Project Co will borrow approximately $3,285,000 to fund the acquisition of the 34 acres and fund 3rd party engineering and development costs. The 3rd party engineering and development work is necessary for Project Co to submit a PPA application to PSEG Long Island. There is a risk that Project Co does not make a satisfactory application to PSEG Long Island for the PPA and/or PSEG Long Island does not approve the application. In the event that PSEG Long Island does not approve the PPA application (even after resubmissions), Solar X will not be able to develop the Solar Farm. Solar X Group has mitigated this risk by assembling a team of consultants with solar design, engineering and planning experience. For MRWA LendCo, it will have a security interest over the land in the form of a mortgage. Without the PPA, Project Co will be unable to access any additional funds from the Escrow Account and, if MRWA LendCo accelerates the loan, it will have the ability to sell the land to a third party and potentially recover all or a portion of the $3,285,000. RWA LendCo will receive a broker price opinion in respect of the project site prior to the initial advance. The broker price opinion will opine on the value of the project site. Construction Risks. The Solar X financing is for an as-yet constructed and pre-operational solar farm. As a result, MRWA LendCo and FoundationCo will have exposure to construction-related risks. Broadly, Project Co, as a reasonable and prudent operator, should seek to mitigate construction related risks through its contractual relationships. Typically, in similar transactions, contracting parties will endeavor to allocate risks and the associated mitigations to the party best able to mitigate the particular risk. Project Co and MRWA LendCo will be aligned in respect of risk identification and mitigation. Schedule delay and/or increased costs are the two key adverse impacts of risks arising during the construction stage. Solar farm projects will have exposure to a common set of technical and non-technical risks during the construction period. Technical risks, include, as an illustration:   PV equipment performance that is below the guaranteed performance parameters   Accelerated degradation of the PV equipment   The actual solar resource is less than the estimated solar resource   Poor system design   Site characterization and access risks   Delays in manufacturing, transport and/or installation of PV equipment   Non-technical risks, include, as an illustration:   The delay in the acquisition of permits and/or other regulatory authorizations   The EPC contractor does not have the necessary construction and installation experience   The negotiation and execution of the interconnection and power purchase agreement is delayed or not on commercial terms   Higher costs and/or lack of availability of insurance (general liability, property risk, environmental risk, and/or business interruption)   Site control   General events of force majeure   Solar X Group models an installed cost of $2.55 watt/DC. The modeled cost is on the higher range of the installed price for similarly sized solar farms.  1600\u00d71154 184 KB  Source: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Utility Scale Solar Update: 2020 Edition, Nov. 2020. Solar X Group has indicated that the Construction Contract will include the following terms to address common construction related risks:  A fixed completion price A fixed completion date Restrictions on the ability of AECOM to claim extensions of time and additional cost Solar Farm output and performance guarantees Liquidated damages for schedule delays Liquidated damages for performance deficiencies Procedures for change orders Allocation of permitting responsibility between AECOM and Project Co Security and guarantees from AECOM Termination rights Single, point responsibility of AECOM as contractor  While we have not reviewed the Construction Contract, the points above are typical in construction contracts for power generation facilities. Operational Risks Once the Solar Farm achieves commercial operation, MRWA LendCo and FoundationCo will have exposure to operational risks. As with the construction period, Project Co, as a reasonable and prudent operator, should seek to mitigate operations related risks through its contractual relationships and allocate risks and the associated mitigations to the party best able to mitigate the particular risk. Project Co and MRWA LendCo will be aligned in respect of risk identification and mitigation. Solar farm projects will have exposure to a common set of technical and non-technical risks during the operational period. Technical risks, include, without limitation:   PV equipment failures or defects that result in higher maintenance costs and/or lower electrical production   Solar resource inadequacy that results in lower electrical production   Inadequate operations and maintenance budgets that result in actual costs being higher than the modelled assumptions   Delays in PSEG Long Island\u2019s integration of the solar electricity into the grid   Non-Technical risks, include, without limitation:   LI ServCo\u2019s non-performance under the PPA   Weather risk   Power price risk   General events of force majeure   At the present time, Solar X Group has not finalized its power purchase agreement with LI ServCo. Solar X Group has indicated that it anticipates that LI ServCo will use the standard power purchase agreement found at https://www.psegliny.com/aboutpseglongisland/ratesandtariffs/tariffs/-/media/FA416619D4A34149A7B4E28FA9413777.ashx The average annual solar radiation for the area surrounding the Solar Farm site is 4.07 kWh/m2/day. Solar X Group provided the monthly average of solar radiation, anticipated kWh production associated with such solar radiation, and the estimated value based on a per kilowatt tariff of $0.2168 per kWh. The table below includes revenue associated with kWh production made available under the PPA as a result of the availability of battery storage.  1085\u00d7800 36.6 KB  The map below graphically represents the solar radiation for the part of Suffolk County where the Solar X Farm will be located.   1600\u00d7781 150 KB   Solar X Group models operational and maintenance costs of $32.40/kW. While this figure may be higher than the national average, the figure does include a measure of contingency and, in the event that actual amounts are lower, will improve the cash available for debt service.  1383\u00d7710 99.5 KB  Source: Ryan Wiser, Mark Bolinger, and Joachim Seel, \u201cBenchmarking Utility-Scale PV Operational Expenses and Project Lifetimes:Results from a Survey of U.S. Solar Industry Professionals\u201d Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, June 2020 Loan Administration Risks MRWA LendCo will rely on a 3rd party service company for the general administration of the Financing Agreements. MRWA LendCo will not be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Financing Agreements. Uprets US LLC has not yet selected the servicer. To mitigate against any risks associated with the administration of the Financing Agreements, the 3rd party servicer contract will specify, among others, the exact rights and responsibilities of the servicer, on-going monitoring of the servicer, and MRWA LendCo\u2019s right to terminate and replace the servicer. Uprets US LLC and the RWA Core Unit have reviewed several potential candidates but have not yet aligned on the servicer. The servicer should have sufficient experience, loans under management, and a willingness to service a $21 million loan (considered to be on the small size for many established servicer companies). MRWA LendCo may elect to retain certain authorities and/or require the servicer to confirm in advance certain actions prior to taking such actions (e.g., satisfaction of disbursement conditions, amendments, waivers, notices of default and events of default, acceleration of the loan under the Financing Agreements). Single Project Concentration Risk The proposed financing will be made to Project Co. Project Co will not have any additional sources of revenue other than the PPA. As a consequence, there is concentrated risk in a single borrower and project. In the event that Solar X Group and Project Co are unable to successfully develop, operate, and/or maintain the Project, there is a material risk that Project Co will be unable to repay the Loan. The proposed 12 month debt service funding will provide assurance of repayment during the pre-development and construction stages. Further, RWA LendCo will have a mortgage on the 34 acres as collateral security. Environmental Concerns Notwithstanding the general public support for solar farm development in New York and its benefits in producing carbon-free electricity, there is a risk of environmental protest against the conversion of existing farmland for solar development. This risk is mitigated by New York State\u2019s preference to develop solar electrical generation.  Outline  Industry analysis  The State of New York seeks to accelerate the development of solar power throughout the state. New York\u2019s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (2019) calls for installing 6,000 megawatts of solar by 2025 and 3,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030. New York has established an extensive legal, regulatory and financial framework to support the overall development of solar power generation.  1600\u00d7636 81.2 KB  Source: www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/new-york-solar The Solar Farm will be located in the Town of Mattituck, Suffolk County, New York. As of March 31, 2021, Suffolk County has 539.7 MW of installed solar production capacity across 35,364 projects. See Statewide Solar Projects - NYSERDA The US National Renewable Laboratory identifies the following industry challenges and opportunities in its \u201cH2 2020 Solar Industry Update\u201d released in April 2021:  1600\u00d7897 381 KB   1600\u00d7896 424 KB  Source: www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79758.pdf  Asset originator analysis  UPRETS originated the Solar X Group loan. UPRETS is a DeFi CRE lender and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xinyuan Real Estate Co., Ltd. (\u201cXinyuan\u201d), a NYSE-listed real estate developer and property manager primarily in China and recently in other countries. In China, Xinyuan develops and manages large scale, high quality real estate projects in over ten tier one and tier two cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Xi\u2019an, Suzhou, Dalian, Zhuhai and Foshan. Xinyuan was one of the first Chinese real estate developers to enter the U.S. market and over the past few years has been active in real estate development in New York. Xinyuan aims to provide comfortable and convenient real estate related products and services to middle-class consumers. UPRETS is focused on simplifying investment in real estate using Blockchain. Currently, Xinyuan has a high bankruptcy risk due to its outstanding debt obligations.  1600\u00d7834 97.3 KB  Further, in April 2021, Xinyuan delayed the filing of its 2020 audited financials (20-F) as Xinyuan\u2019s audit committee, with the assistance of external advisors, was conducting an independent review of certain transactions to assess their potential impact on the Xinyuan\u2019s 2020 financial statements. As of August 20, 2021, Xinyuan had not yet filed its 20-F with the Securities Exchange Commission. To address the bankruptcy and insolvency risk of Xinyuan (and indirectly, Uprets US LLC), MRWA LendCo will receive a true sale opinion from Uprets US LLC\u2019s external legal counsel (see Highlights: Financing above).

Token issuer analysis  Not applicable.  Industry analysis Provide an overview of the industry where the SPV asset will be, especially what are the risk, benchmark, and historical behavior. A market comparison with other lenders can be useful as well. How do those assets respond in the event of a particular major economic event? Solar projects that have long-term power purchase agreements and credit worthy offtakers can be considered very stable. As the solar farm does not have any moving parts (unlike a natural gas fired or nuclear power station), the operational and maintenance risks may be considered lower than other forms of power generation. The most material economic event to impact Project Co and the Solar Farm would be: (1) a material credit event for LI ServCo, LIPA, PSEG Long Island, and/or PSEG (i.e., bankruptcy), and (2) a material and negative change to New York\u2019s current policies in favor of solar electricity. What remedial measures might be undertaken? In the event of a material credit event for LI ServCo, LIPA, PSEG Long Island and/or PSEG during the term of the power purchase agreement, it will be important to assess LI ServCo and LIPA\u2019s willingness, as offtaker, to continue to purchase solar electric power from the Solar X Farm. In the event of a LI ServCo or LIPA credit event, there is a legal and commercial risk that LI ServCo or LIPA might determine that the power purchase agreement is out of market and \u201creject\u201d (as permitted in bankruptcy) the power purchase agreement. The risk that either LI ServCo or LIPA, as instrumentalities of the State of New York, file for bankruptcy may be considered low. A PSEG Long Island material credit event, as operator for the transmission and distribution system in Suffolk County, may have a material impact on the operations under the PPA. PSEG Long Island credit risk is mitigated by the fact that LI ServCo and LIPA are the contractual counterparties under the PPA. A material and negative change to New York\u2019s current policies in favor of solar electricity is unlikely to require any specific actions unless LI ServCo or LIPA defaults under the PPA. What are the historical default rates in this industry? No public information on aggregate historical default rates for solar developers is available.  Asset originator analysis Focus on the asset originator and the kind of business that will be conducted in the SPV. When was the asset originator incorporated? May 13, 2019 and Project Co will be formed proximate to the execution of any necessary project and/or financing agreements\u2026 What is the background of the asset originator managers? See \u201cAsset originator analysis\u201d in paragraph 2 under \u201cOutline\u201d.

Olive, NC, Palmer, MA, Jetersville, VA, Wantagh, NY, and Hicksville, NY. Has the asset originator experienced a default? What is the plan in case of default? No. Uprets US LLC will sell the Financing Agreements to MRWA LendCo. From the date of such sale, Uprets US LLC will not be involved in the transaction and MRWA LendCo will not have any credit exposure to Uprets US LLC. What is the due diligence they use to accept an asset? Solar X Group will undertake an extensive due diligence prior to commencement of a solar project development. Solar X Group provided its internal due diligence checklist / workflow which addresses the following:  Regulatory support and tariffs, especially the duration and timeline for any incentives for solar power. Suitable site identified taking account of site constraints. Grid access (proximity, capacity, and policy provisions for access).

The loan will be secured by a first priority security interest on all of the Project Co\u2019s assets, including the land, improvements and the Solar X Farm equipment. What are the historical default rates of the originator? None. What explains the difference in default rates between the asset originator and the industry? Not applicable.  Issuance platform analysis The assets remain fully off-chain and there is no on-chain issuance platform used.  Implementation details Some details on the implementation are still worked on and some changes may occur until the closing of the transaction. The implementation will follow MIP58 RWA Foundations (still in RFC). A Cayman Foundation (\u201cFoundation Co\u201d) will be created which will have a member-managed Delaware LLC (\u201cMRWA LendCo\u201d). MRWA LendCo will hold the construction and term loan note from Project Co. Further, MRWA LendCo will be the secured party under the security agreements.  Foundation Co The RWF Core Unit is using the help of Ogier, a Tier 1 law firm for Trusts in the Caymans, to set up the Cayman Foundation. It is designed so MakerDAO can keep much flexibility. There is nevertheless a provision so the Foundation Co can continue to operate even if MakerDAO goes \u201cdark\u201d (governance attack, smart contract issue, Emergency Shutdown, \u2026). A STAR Trust structure was also analyzed but was offering less flexibility for no additional benefit. A comparison between some Real-World Asset legal structures can be found here. Foundation Co documents:  Memorandum of Association Articles of Association  The director role will be filled by a global firm (~600 employees). The director will have a fiduciary duty to the Foundation. The supervisor role and secretary position will be filled by a smaller Cayman Island firm. The Secretary is a qualified person under Cayman law.  MRWA LendCo Foundation Co will establish MRWA LendCo, a member managed Delaware limited liability company to hold the asset (the Financing Agreement). It will be member managed by Foundation Co, thus inheriting the same security level as set forth in the FoundationCo organizational documents. MWRA LendCo will retain an independent third party servicing firm to service the Solar X financing and manage the day-by-day operations associated with the financing (below is a non exhaustive list of duties for the Servicer):  Send invoices to the Borrower for payments due under the Financing Agreements Review tax, insurance and replacement reserve escrows on an annual basis and adjust required monthly escrow payments Confirm satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each disbursement from the Escrow Account Send notices of default and events of default (subject to a DAO Resolution) Coordinate, on MWRA LendCo\u2019s behalf, modifications, work-outs and restructuring of Loans as may from time to time be required (in case of default)  Subject to FoundationCo and MRWA LendCo\u2019s satisfactory completion of KYC, it is anticipated that US Bank, a subsidiary of US Bankcorp (NYSE: USB, $82.55 billion market cap) will serve as the escrow agent. The escrow agreement will identify the conditions precedent required for each disbursement (including the initial disbursement into the escrow account). The more general conditions precedent will likely include, without limitation, the following:   Project Co has received its required equity contributions to ensure the contractually agreed debt-to-equity ratio.   No default or event of default exists or is continuing.   Project Co\u2019s representations and warranties are, as of the date of the disbursement request and the date of the disbursement, true and accurate in all respects.   Each of the Financing Agreements executed as of such date are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Project Co.   Project Co does not have knowledge of the breach of any covenant.   All Financing Agreements required to be executed at that time, have been executed, and all security interests intended to be created by such time have been perfected.   The servicer will have received each of the legal opinions required by the Financing Agreements, which will include opinions from Project Co\u2019s counsel.   Project Co will have delivered such documents to the escrow agent as required by the Construction Loan Agreement, including, a zoning report and a broker\u2019s price opinion.   Each disbursement may include, in addition to the above, such other conditions precedent appropriate for the relevant disbursement date (i.e., execution of the PPA and issuance of the notice to proceed to the EPC contractor). The Servicer will review and confirm satisfaction of each of the conditions precedent required for disbursements from the escrow account. The servicer will instruct the escrow agent when the servicer is satisfied that Project Co has satisfied each of the conditions precedent to the disbursement. A broker will be used for the DAI (MIP21 conduit) <-> USD (US Bank escrow account). Either Foundation Co or MRWA LendCo will be the named account holder with the broker. To address any leakage from the broker account, there are a few protective measures to be discussed with the broker, including, one or all of the following:   The dollar account number and DAI wallet address will be specifically referred to in the broker account agreement.   The broker agreement will expressly provide that upon receipt of any dollars to the account of Foundation Co or MRWA LendCo (as appropriate), the broker shall automatically, without further instruction, convert such dollars into DAI and direct the DAI to the DAI wallet address.   The Foundation Co or MRWA LendCo organizational documents will expressly provide that no director, supervisor, officer, secretary or other authorized person may amend the broker account agreement without an affirmative DAO Resolution.   Foundation Co or MRWA LendCo (depending on the account holder) will provide the broker with the organizational documents referred to above together with a certification to the broker that no director, supervisor, officer, secretary or other authorized person is authorized to make amendments to the broker account agreement.   The express references to the dollar account account number and DAI wallet address, the requirement for automatic exchange and transfer of DAI to the DAI wallet address, the contractual restrictions on amendment of the broker agreement, the express limitation of authority in the organizational documents, and the certification delivered to the broker, will ensure that the broker only follows the terms of the broker agreement and that dollars are converted into DAI and sent to the DAI wallet address. Any amendment to the broker account agreement will require a DAO resolution. Based on the above, it is our view that control by third parties over the cashflow (including DAI) is quite limited. The destination wallet address is under control of MakerDAO. Any change of the broker agreement would need a MakerDAO Resolution. The escrow account will be under supervision of the escrow agent. In addition to concluding whether Project Co has (or has not) satisfied each of the conditions precedent to disbursement from the escrow account, the Construction Loan Agreement will require MRWA LendCo to administer the loan. Thus, even though MRWA LendCo will engage a service company to undertake non-commercial tasks in respect of loan administration, it is anticipated that commercial decisions in respect of the Construction Loan Agreement (waivers, amendments, defaults, and the like) will require MWRA LendCo to make a decision. Acting through DAO Resolution is one solution but Governance might delegate such decisions to a RWA-focused Parameter Proposal Group or a RWA Core Unit specialized in RWA management. That will lead to a fully autonomous vehicle and keeping MakerDAO remote from the management. MakerDAO, through a DAO Resolution, will retain the ability to step in when/if needed. The types of decisions that Governance might delegate to a RWA-focused Parameter Proposal Group or a RWA Core Unit include:  Notifying the borrower of a default Authority to take time sensitive measures to project lender rights Immaterial (non-monetary) waivers under the finance agreements Immaterial (non-monetary) amendments of the finance agreements Administrative matters to maintain MWRA LendCo\u2019s security interests Authorize payments of administrative fees, costs and expenses for loan management  More importantly, Governance might retain certain decisions for a DAO Resolution:  Approving MWRA LendSo\u2019s execution of finance agreements Notifying the borrower of a event of default All other measures to protect MWRA LendCo\u2019s rights All other waivers and amendments under the finance agreements Initiate and enforce rights and remedies under any finance agreement (e.g., loan acceleration, collateral enforcement, etc.)   Proposed covenants The Construction Loan Agreement will set forth affirmative and negative covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on change orders under the EPC Contract. The Construction Loan Agreement will also set forth events of default and cure periods customary for transactions of this type.  Allowed investments At this stage, only one investment is contemplated as detailed in this risk assessment. Additional investment in a similar SolarX project will require a Maker Governance action (increasing the Debt Ceiling).  Minimum SPV CR ratio For this section, the SPV is \u201cProject Co\u201d. At MRWA LendCo level, there will be a security interest in the assets of the SPV.  SPV Collateralization ratio formula This project use the loan to cost metric (LTC): Loan to cost = loan principal amount / expenses & investments at cost This formula will be inverted in order to obtain a collateralization ratio (collateral being evaluated at cost).  Collateralization ratio proposed threshold 133% (equivalent to a 75% LTC)  Minimum Vault CR ratio The vault CR is 100% as there will be no overcollateralization at the token level.  Minimum Vault Underlying CR ratio This is the result of SPV CR * Vault CR if all the SPV debt is used as Vault Collateral. Check the RWA Documentation for more information. 133% (100% for Vault CR ratio and 133% for SPV CR.  Concentration risks There is only one investment so the concentration risk is high.  Stakeholders rules There is only one direct loan so there are no stakeholders. ",

Solar X Group provided the monthly average of solar radiation, anticipated kWh production associated with such solar radiation, and the estimated value based on a per kilowatt tariff of $0.2168 per kWh.

                    "content": "Thanks for the write-up @christiancdpetersen! I want to echo what @PaperImperium has mentioned:     PaperImperium:  But shouldn\u2019t the kilowatt rate be $0.02168 rather than $0.2168 if a megawatt rate is $21.69?   A typo might have slipped somewhere misrepresenting the price. IMO it is highly unlikely that anyone would accept $0.02/kwh as projects usually achieve some sort of breakeven around $0.15/kwh, $0.21/kwh making hence a lot of sense. Of course there is a ton to unpack, but I really wanted to emphasize this:     christiancdpetersen:  In the event that PSEG Long Island does not approve the PPA application (even after resubmissions), Solar X will not be able to develop the Solar Farm.   It is very clear that solar, in its current state, is vastly uncompetitive ($/kwh)  in most areas of the world for commercial energy production. A favorable PPA is by far the most important component of a successful site. I am very happy to see that the actors seem to understand this.     christiancdpetersen:  New York\u2019s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (2019) calls for installing 6,000 megawatts of solar by 2025 and 3,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030.   This is also quite encouraging.     christiancdpetersen:  Without the PPA, Project Co will be unable to access any additional funds from the Escrow Account and, if MRWA LendCo accelerates the loan, it will have the ability to sell the land to a third party and potentially recover all or a portion of the $3,285,000.   If I understand correctly, the actors would still go forward with buying the land without having secured a PPA and given a failure of agreement, land would fall in the hands of MRWA, which is a Maker-controlled entity? Could you just explain a bit what would be the process given this scenario regarding governance and decision-making i.e. who would decide on the course of action? Overall, I think the project is awesome, not only from a financial perspective (solar is a great business given good conditions), but also from a social/reputational perspective for Maker. I hope this will be reflected accurately in our marketing strategy (even if we don\u2019t have a Marketing CU at the moment), because it would boost popular opinion of the DAO significantly IMO. ",

A slide error occurred at least in some of the graphics, since they match up perfectly other than being off by a difference divisible by 9. Also, just visually you can tell. The question is whether the slide error is just in the graphics or if it\u2019s at an earlier stage in the material. If it\u2019s earlier, then this section may also be fairly different:     christiancdpetersen:  Solar X Group anticipates that the \u201cFull Requirement Period\u201d tariff will be between $55.96/MWh to $83.94/MWh. Solar X Group used a conservative $44.77 (a discount of 20% from $55.96/MWh) as an input in its model. Solar X Group anticipates that the \u201cDispatchable Period\u201d tariff will be between $13.99/MWh to $16.49/MWh as of the first half of 2021. Solar X Group used a conservative $13.99/MWh tariff as an input in its model. Solar X Group blended the Full Requirement Period tariff and the Dispatchable Period tariff inputs to arrive at a final tariff rate of $21.69/MWh for purposes of the model.   If it\u2019s just in the graphics, then we need to know which one is incorrect. The first graphic is consistent in units of MWh<>kWh with the latter one, though, so the discrepancy is likely with the price and not the units produced. My guess is the blended rate is actually supposed to be $216.90/MWh, since $21.69 doesn\u2019t provide enough revenue to service the loan without significant alternative sources of revenue. But $216.90/MWh would also mean a lot of the inputs before it all suffered from a slide error at the same time. Anyway, let\u2019s wait to see what the scoop is. ",

Could you just explain a bit what would be the process given this scenario regarding governance and decision-making i.e. who would decide on the course of action?   @NH98, you correctly note that the disbursement of a portion of the loan to Project Co in advance of an executed PPA is a material risk. It would be customary in a traditional project finance structure that Project Co have signed the PPA as a condition precedent to the 1st disbursement. Having said that, MRWA LendCo will have a mortgage over the 34 acres in the event that Project Co does not sign a PPA. We structured the Articles of Association of Foundation Co to require an affirmative DAO Resolution before MRWA LendCo can (a) issue a default or event of default notice or (b) exercise rights and remedies under the relevant financing agreement. As FoundationCo will manage MRWA LendCo as a member-managed Delaware limited liability company pursuant to a simple single member operating agreement, the decisions will rest at the FoundationCo level. Technically, if there is an affirmative DAO Resolution to take a specified action, the Director of FoundationCo will cause FoundationCo to cause MRWA LendCo to take the relevant action. (see clause 4.12 of the draft Articles of Association and Schedule A of the draft Articles of Association). In terms of the \u201con-ground\u201d actions to sell the property, the Servicer will be acting for MRWA LendCo. ",

I read this but no parties or amounts are listed.   The owners of Solar X Group will be required, as a condition to the initial disbursement from the escrow account, to fund Project Co with equity so that the debt-to-equity ratio is maintained (i.e., debt and equity are funded on a pro rata basis). Solar X Group will only be able to demonstrate satisfaction of this condition precedent by showing evidence of the equity investment in Project Co. This could range from audited to unaudited financials (or other satisfactory evidence). If Project Co does not have the equity contribution to meet the debt-to-equity ratio requirement, there will not be any disbursement. The same concept will apply for each subsequent disbursement. Most solar projects in the US are driven by the tax credit generated by the project and potential \u201ctax credit\u201d investors will invest closer to the start of commercial operations. We do not have the names of such \u201ctax credit\u201d investors. Solar X is unlikely to provide us with such names.     MakerMan:  Who holds the property currently and what is the property transfer history, dates, parties, amounts?   We have not, as part of this initial diligence process, investigated the current status or past history of the property (owner, etc.). However, the Construction Loan Agreement includes conditions precedent to the initial disbursement, among others, that (A) MRWA LendCo received the Title Policy insuring the Mortgage, (B) the property will be acquired by ProjectCo free and clear of liens and defects, (C) MRWA LendCo received the broker price opinion and a zoning report (all being satisfactory to MRWA LendCo). We can certainly request the historical information on the property at this stage, but we structured the Construction Loan Agreement to provide us visibility on these points as part of the disbursement process.     MakerMan:  I have serious concerns over the control of costs with the operational intermediary.   By \u201coperational intermediary\u201d, do you mean MRWA LendCo or ProjectCo?     MakerMan:  There is something that doesn\u2019t sit right with me here about the total loan $21M basically paying up front for everything and asking for their first years interest to boot. This sticks out like a sore thumb that again there are no parties with any risk here.   The $21 million will be funded into escrow with US Bank and subject to conditions precedent for disbursement to Project Co. In the worst case, Project Co never satisfies the conditions precedent for disbursement from escrow in accordance with the proposed disbursement schedule, and the full $21 million is returned to MRWA LendCo. Of course, we could time the funding of amounts into escrow in accordance with the proposed disbursement schedule. In this case, DAI is only created when Project Co satisfies the conditions for each disbursement. As RWA financing via DAI is reasonably novel, Solar X Group may have concern that it has made financial commitments and satisfied the conditions precedent for a specific disbursement, but the DAI is not forthcoming for whatever reason in respect of that disbursement. We have sought to address this concern by locking the funds (USD) in escrow until such time that Project Co satisfies the relevant conditions precedent for release in accordance with the disbursement schedule. In terms of \u201cskin the game\u201d, Project Co will have to satisfy and then maintain the required debt-to-equity ratio as a condition to access the escrow amounts. By definition then, there will be \u201cskin in the game\u201d.     MakerMan:  My biggest issue is the property ownership history at this point.   The point is noted. If the acquisition of the property is an issue, Maker could seek to delay the 1st disbursement until the property is acquired and the PPA is executed. My observations regarding maintenance of debt-to-equity ratios will continue to apply, but in this case, we will require a larger portion of the equity upfront. This is a perfectly reasonable approach and common in some projects (e.g., LNG liquefaction project financing for example). As presently structured the debt and equity is funded on a pro rata basis. This is also an acceptable approach. ",

I\u2019m nervous about project finance and the term, but the pared-down scale and my personal familiarity with the construction process for these farms makes me think this is a good risk/reward. The biggest risk in my eyes is prior to getting the PPA, and the value at risk is quite low at that point. It will also be a reasonably sized bite of the apple to kick the tires on this RWA Foundation structure, though my support for this one-off project should not be construed as an expression of support for it generally. In particular, I do not like the idea of stacking lots of projects into a single entity. We should also be cognizant of the optics of this project. This would be proof that crypto can provide jobs + green energy, and be a sound rebuttal to those stating crypto is only a casino for speculation. Additionally, this is a Republican district in a Democratic state that is the most important for financial activity and regulation within the US. There are lots of constituencies that are likely to be happy about this if we make them aware of it. While not worth the cost of the project in total, for the amount at risk before securing an agreement with an investment-grade counterparty for the PPA, the cash at risk for the initial land purchase is in my opinion worth the risk. The rate is also not really 5.8% according to the summary PDF. It is 550 bps over SOFR. SOFR has been nailed to the floor since March of 2020, and this is a number that can (but not necessarily) go up substantially over the life of the loan. March 2020 began with around 160 bps for SOFR, which is fairly typical. That gives us positive exposure to higher interest rates, which is why I think the term of 5 + 5 is acceptable. I think we should all also \u2014 myself included \u2014 thank @christiancdpetersen and especially @SebVentures for shepherding this proposal for months to get to this point.

My experience with PV systems is older, it is possible that the system you are designing may already be immune to these problems common to older solar systems. What I am missing from your description:   It mentions the radiation values and the annual degradation of the system, but I couldn\u2019t find any data on other efficiency-degrading weather parameters such as average area cloud cover and temperature. Both cause significant production losses. In cloudy weather the radiation decreases while in high temperatures the efficiency of solar cells decreases. These must be taken into account. The data given in the solar cell data sheet is valid for an ideal situation, which will be lower in the actual operating conditions.   The efficiency of the solar system is highest at medium radiation levels, and most of the energy produced annually is generated in this range. As you state in your table, higher irradiance = higher power output is only true under optimal conditions, which is not always the case in nature. (Rather, it never is\u2026)   Failure to take these into account may lead to a significant overestimation of the actual system performance. Accurate prediction of system performance can reduce the risk of investment, and performing calculations based on accurate models is vital.  Is it not possible to feed power directly into the grid at this scale? Building out a battery system is a significant additional cost, plus a source of errors and degrades the overall efficiency of the system (inverter and battery losses). Has this option been explored?  If so, what is the difference in net present value (NPV) between the two investments?  ",

Literally Maker takes on ALL of the risk and everyone else gets all the benefit(s). I honestly think Maker can and should do better than this type of proposal and saying yes to this means Maker lowers the bar on RWA standards even lower than it already has. Maker should insist on a certain level of up front openness with information and a certain level of upfront equity so Maker knows the stakeholders in the projects actually have a material stake and not just a \u2018made up after the fact stake\u2019 of some uncertain value.     christiancdpetersen:  By \u201coperational intermediary\u201d, do you mean MRWA LendCo or ProjectCo?   I would have to look back to be sure but I think it is ProjectCo basically using PSEG Long Island.     christiancdpetersen:  How many deals has the asset originator already done? What is the notional amount? Solar X Group management members and partners have been involved in the installation and operation of over 1,000 acres of solar panels at sites in Brooklyn, NY, Warren, PA, Mt. Olive, NC, Palmer, MA, Jetersville, VA, Wantagh, NY, and Hicksville, NY.   The question is not answered.  What is the notional value of these projects?     christiancdpetersen:  The loan will be secured by a first priority security interest on all of the Project Co\u2019s assets, including the land, improvements and the Solar X Farm equipment.   Again I see nothing of details of what (if any) is the real equity interest being put up by whom here.   This is my real sticking point.    I see nothing that shows where any party on these deals is going to put up $.01 much less 33% on 21M (6.6M) anywhere and I am being told that this information will materialize once the 21M is escrow\u2019d. Had the land been purchased and put up as collateral equity on a 18M borrow (to show a 15% equity stake) and the PPA in hand. I would be much more supportive of this. Based on a number of Solar installations I am aware of - cost vs. return on doing Battery storage is prohibitive.   I see nothing in the proposal here even suggesting why this is preferred.  I also do not see a real analysis of conditions/situations based on historical weather, cloud patterns that could materially affect the success of this project. There are so many things about this proposal I simply don\u2019t like.   These players say they have done 1000 acres of installations.  If these things are so profitable then why can\u2019t they even use SOME of the profits from those installations to fund some of the initial equity here.     christiancdpetersen:  @jameskmccall Solar X Group has indicated that, based on both guidance from independent third party brokers and comparables, the 34 acres has a market value in excess of $3 million. Solar X Group has requested a broker price opinion from Brown Harris Stevens. Solar X has also indicated that, to make up the difference, Solar X Group will pay the landowner with a portion of the tax credits generated by the Project.   Then why if they are going to use the \u2018tax credits\u2019 to pay for part of the land is it still listed at 3.285M?   3.0M listed on the \u2018detailed cost breakdown\u2019?   There is nothing in the listed costs that show this exchange of the 'tax credits against land sale imo).  Permitting listed at 21.8K, environmental at 25K and legal at 826.7K\u2026 Also even when I take the 25.5M/21M I get 121% based on cost paid.  1.33 would mean a SPV after all is said and done of 27.9M a lot of these costs will only have value if the project gets the required permit (if this fails I expect the land likely would not be worth as much and the tax credits are useless in this case) performs.   A whole 20% of the upfront project cost is for batteries btw.   They could cut the project cost by at least 20% doing away with this aspect of the project and improve the overall profitability dramatically. This honestly looks like the deal is structured so that Maker takes on all the risk as pretty much the sole investor and all the other parties get all the upside.   Were I myself looking at investing in this I would personally pass based on a few key points.  investors bear the complete brunt of losses (this basically falls on Maker) while all the other parties participate in upside all for a fixed return at what 5.5%+ incomplete upfront material information on land history. lack of upfront investment by any party here. I see zero justification for the $5M for batteries - this part makes no sense to me based on other solar investment projects I am aware of personally. Project prospectus does not include scenario situations should performance, weather, operational costs exceed the optimal situation. Project conditional on PPA (this should have been in hand)  Other issues are basically related to Project structure. What is the path of DAI to USD and back?  Who handles the money?  Same with equity liens.  What is the custody path to the DAO here.  Who has operational say so, should this deal fall through at PPA stage of property disposal.  Who is on the hook where for the expenses to hold the property while a sale goes through (taxes, etc.).  Who decides what to do with equity if at any point this deal fails to perform (exit clauses).   Who is the entity that is not just setting up the performance clauses for release of funds, but who is providing the quality assurance performance has been met TO release the funds.   I don\u2019t have a good feeling for the \u2018disaster scenarios\u2019 here and what happens to the cash against the collateral.    I didn\u2019t get into any of the details of the structural issue because my feeling here is the lack of upfront equity and a stakeholder standing to lose some equity if this deal goes south makes this deal a high risk for the reward than I would otherwise like to see coming to Maker. Based on other investments I have seen as an investor I am rather sure I could take on less risk, get more upfront equity by the players (assuring me some people actually have vested interests in success and will lose their stakes if it fails) and/or get a better return for the investor risk being undertaken here.  Maker is basically putting up virtually all of the funds, taking on all the loss risk, for basically a fixed rate of return that isn\u2019t guaranteed by any other equity or investor.  I honestly am not even sure a bank would take this on given the way the deal is structured for the returns being offered. I know team probably has done a lot of work but I am sorry @SebVentures and @christiancdpetersen  as this stands I just can\u2019t support this particular project. ",

The thing I don\u2019t like is that it\u2019s just an idea, there\u2019s not even an HoT/LOI in place. If there\u2019s no other way to secure the PPA and we \u201chave to\u201d take this deal forward\u2026 then I\u2019d just try to think of the value of the land (what\u2019s it worth if there\u2019s actually no way of getting the PPA and so building the solar farm) and how to mitigate this risk (pro valuation would be helpful). Again, if we have to take this forward, I\u2019d go with a lower ratio, let\u2019s say 60/40 for the land acquisition (so we put in 1,8M they put 1,2M) with first lien mortgage for us. Afterward we could refinance with a higher ratio\u2026 For me the PPA is fundamental here and so my honest recommendation (unless we plan on owning a piece of land here and there  ) is to get the PPA in place first, before making any contributions, which in this case (as I understand) would require them to buy the land (which is a typical case in project finance, sort of skin in the game point).

First, thank you for your interest and support of our project and business. We are very pleased to be working with MakerDAO on such a pioneering venture and we have been familiar with MakerDAO for many years, as we ourselves have been deeply involved in the blockchain/cryptocurrency industry for the past 3 years. We have collaborated with some of the most respected names in the industry such as Securitize, Swarm, tZERO and with some well respected companies in Asia as well, such as Factblock in South Korea, and of course, UPRETS in Hong Kong. We have structured a digital currency based real estate fund in the past and we have plans to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies in our renewable business in the near future to help solve some of the challenges in the conversion to clean energy and to facilitate investment in the industry. (Carbon credit offset tokens, etc.) We believe the intersection of renewables and crypto will continue to be adopted rapidly in the months and years ahead. I will reply to the questions from the community above individually, which we believe will help make some of the points about the transaction more clear, but, we also felt it useful to provide a bit of background for you about us, this transaction and the opportunities ahead. Approximately two years ago, we held discussions with large institutional private equity funds, Apollo, Blackstone and Carlyle Group, to build utility-scale solar projects for them. Blackstone offered to fund 100% of the cost of a similar project to this one in Mattituck and then to buy it from us at COD (Commercial Operation Date) for a premium of 25%. We decided there was more value to develop this project for ourselves and to build out our pipeline of 500+acres of land for development into a broad portfolio. As you know well, there is a huge demand for conversion to renewable energy and this is our mission - to accelerate this process through increased access to solar energy. To give you a sense of the current market for utility-scale solar, these institutional type investors are now offering up to 50% to developers to build. We ourselves have been approached by multiple institutional lenders in the past weeks with term sheets for our projects as well as offers to acquire. As demand for renewable energy continues to rise, federal, state and local policies are becoming more and more favorable to support solar development. Also, note that one year ago, the ITCs (Investment Tax Credits) were being sold in the market at $0.95, and now, on average, they are being sold at $1.30 (Source: Novogradac). The interest, demand and support of renewables is evident and we are glad to be a part of Maker\u2019s recognition of the importance of the renewable energy industry. Regarding what we have seen is one of the main topics here, we noticed in the Collateral Onboarding Risk Assessment that it does mention SolarX is required to maintain the 75/25 debt/equity ratio, but it does not specifically give details about what SolarX is contributing, as you point out well. As we discussed and agreed upon with MakerDAO, SolarX will contribute 25% initial equity in the project, which amounts to $1,095,000. One last note:  Together with @SebVentures and @christiancdpetersen and our partner UPRETS, we have been working on this transaction since the beginning of the year. We have taken it slowly and methodically because of the importance of its success to Maker and all parties involved, as well as the importance of its success as a model to the industry. We at SolarX recognize well that Maker is a leader and pioneer in the industry and so is setting an example for many others to follow. We are working diligently and are thrilled to be part of this partnership to make this happen. Thank you, Andy Strott ",

If we do not succeed in reaching NTP, there is a risk to us at that point that Maker could take over ownership of the land parcel. Note also, many times if a utility or offtaker does not approve a PPA application, they encourage the developer to resubmit it with suggested edits. We have a longstanding relationship with PSE&G Long Island and have had informal discussions with them regarding our project, which they view favorably due to its size and because it also includes battery storage. Both NY State and PSE&G LI have very large mandates for renewables - PSE&G LI is issuing a 135MW battery storage RFI for the North Fork of Long Island, which we view as further supporting our project. Regarding #3) control of costs, we will have an executed development contract with AECOM which will include guaranteed price, completion date, and applicable financial penalties. This is standard in the industry. Regarding #4) note that they $21MM loan goes directly to escrow, not to SolarX, and is disbursed according to a strict schedule that we and Maker\u2019s team have agreed upon. ",

Note if the land owner wishes, we intend to make this a dual-use project, essentially allowing for agricultural production and electricity production from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels occurring together on the same piece of land. This will benefit the local community and economy. Also note that we have been working closely with a team at Cornell University who are conducting a research project for strategic land use for solar energy projects to help prevent any land-use conflicts.

Most utility-scale solar projects are now including storage for multiple reasons. In our case, PSE&G LI looks more favorably upon projects with storage and have mentioned as such to us. In fact, they just issued an RFP for bulk energy storage of 135MW+ of storage capacity. 2021 Bulk Energy Storage RFP There are numerous studies on the value of storage with solar facilities. BloombergNEF, Lazard and others. I will gladly cite references. Based on our conversations with PSEG LI and their input, we have decided to include battery storage to our solar pv projects. Energy storage allows the output of a solar facility to be shifted to the hours of the day when it is most valuable. This will allow the utility to mitigate the steep ramp-up in generation that is required to offset declining solar production in the evening, to serve as a substitute for generation capacity procurements necessary to serve the utility\u2019s net system peak demand, and to reduce potential solar generation curtailments. Additionally, the Project\u2019s batteries are very flexible resources that can respond nearly instantaneously to fluctuations in generation on the system, providing valuable grid balancing services. Storage is a rapidly increasing trend in the industry with huge opportunities and capacity for growth. (see references below). Specifically for us the rationale for including storage is supported by both local and State mandates. Our relationships stated that projects that include storage are a priority for them and will be considered more favorably than those without. This is also a unique opportunity as the pricing of PPAs are reflecting expectations that solar + storage projects will capture the full 26% cost savings available though the Federal ITC and provide more value to the project as a whole. Developing solar plus storage as opposed to adding storage to existing solar projects reduces overall costs by minimum 8%. As for revenue - in our project\u2019s case, adding storage, the revenue increases by 55% at an increased 20% overall project cost. As reference, Bolinger, Seel, and Robson (2019) reported an overall storage premium of $10\u2013 $15/MWh for PPAs with a 30% ITC, for systems that have a 4-hour battery sized to 50%\u201375% of the PV capacity. NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) calculated those numbers to be slightly higher due to the improvement in technologies in just these two short years. https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/utility-scale-solar-empirical-0   nrel.gov    77324.pdf 10.02 MB      Generation during FRP hours is significantly more valuable to the PSE&G Long Island system (or for any utility for this matter) than during other hours of the year. For example, during summer evenings, solar production declines, but demand for electricity is high, driven by significant cooling load. Electricity produced during these evening hours will serve peak demand, reduce the need to run less efficient generating units, and address generation ramping challenges associated with declining solar output while load is still high. By providing higher payments for output during FRP hours, PSE&G Long Island and other utilities are able to encourage the development of projects that would provide not only energy value but also capacity value. 'Adding storage also makes renewable energy more profitable, says Wesley Cole, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. \u201cOne of the challenges of renewable energy is the more you put on the grid, the more the value declines,\u201d Cole says. Storage helps deal with that by soaking up excess energy that would have been lost in the middle of the day, when electricity demand is lower, and moving it to a time when it is more valuable. \u201cWe see storage being a large player across effectively every future we look at,\u201d says Cole. \u201cAnd not just one or two gigawatts\u2026 but tens to hundreds of gigawatts.\u201d\u2019 In a scenario with 30% of annual energy met by solar PV, Mills and Wiser find that the marginal economic value of solar PV increases by 80% when low-cost storage is deployed in the power system compared to a reference case without storage.   escholarship.org    qt672579zp_noSplash_1e851d2c353ef780f477a54a485e34b2.pdf 939.13 KB       \u201cSolar + Storage eclipse conventional resources as the new clean energy generation model\u201d    blog.fluenceenergy.com    Solar + Storage eclipse conventional resources as the new clean energy... Solar is the lowest-cost generation and battery energy storage is the cheapest for flexible peaking capacity. Combined, they will eclipse traditional resources.      \"Energy storage installations around the world will multiply exponentially, from a modest 9GW/17GWh deployed as of 2018 to 1,095GW/2,850GWh by 2040, according to the latest forecast from research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). This 122-fold boom of stationary energy storage over the next two decades will require $662 billion of investment, according to BNEF estimates. It will be made possible by further sharp declines in the cost of lithium-ion batteries, on top of an 85% reduction in the 2010-18 period.\"    BloombergNEF \u2013 31 Jul 19    | BloombergNEF BNEF\u2019s annual Energy Storage Outlook revises up its forecast for global investment in stationary energy storage, and sees majority of capacity likely to be grid-scale.      Benefits of Solar + Storage: 1) Energy cost savings: Both the solar PV facility and the storage facility of Mattituck will provide energy cost savings. Energy storage enhances this benefit. The energy storage facility will charge from output of the solar facility during hours when the energy is less valuable, and discharge the energy when it is more valuable, effectively shifting the solar output to times of day when it provides most value to the PSEGLI system. 2) Reduced generation capacity investment: PSEGLI has a requirement for 130MW of storage demand on the North Fork of Long Island (see above). The utility must procure this capacity from the market each year. Mattituck\u2019s project will reduce PSEGLI\u2019s need to procure capacity. Mattituck\u2019s battery discharging during those net system peak hours adds capacity value.  Like other utilities, PSEGLI procures \u201cspinning reserves\u201d capable of responding rapidly to any contingency ( e.g., unexpected tripping of generators or transmission lines). PSEGLI procures a quantity of spinning reserves to cover their single largest contingency. Storage can provide spinning reserves if operated such that the battery\u2019s state of charge is sufficient to provide the service. Operating Mattituck in this manner will offset the need to procure spinning reserves from other sources.

Personally I was thinking in household scale ( battery not worth for me), obviously the return on investment on an industrial scale is completely different, so again, I could be wrong. I think, electricity is always in high demand and the demand is only going to get higher in medium/long term . But the payback of the battery system in the long run raises more questions for me.  This is a minimum 10 year project. As you mentioned the price of Ni-Mh batteries has dropped 80-90% over the last 8 years and the industry expects a similar price drop for Li-ion batteries in the coming years. However, this is only a price drop due to more efficient manufacturing technology, but there has been no breakthrough in battery technology.There are promising technologies under development, in which huge money are being invested. If these can be brought into industrial production in the near future, they could reduce the current storage capacity prices (USD/KWH) to a fraction of their current level.  At present, the grid management firms like PJM in USA,  struggling to distribute the asymmetries in the electricity grid, so the integration of battery storage systems into the grid is currently being promoted and rewarded in several ways.  System balancing can be done efficiently by integrating battery systems into the grid as buffers, and it is obviously good for the grid operator if this is financed by others.

Of course the 75/25 debt/equity ratio applies to the full 21MM. We will provide the project co structure. I am sure you do not suggest that we are taking a chance by being \u2018brave\u2019 and solely basing our decisions on informal conversations. Clearly just a conversation is not the only basis for including storage in the project. Besides our team\u2019s own analysis, we are working with outside consultants such as Fluence Energy and others in this regard. Again, this is a project that has been more than a year in the planning with some of the top experts in the business such as AECOM, Fluence Energy, Kokam, Allen&Overy, McGuire Woods, Koch Engineering, Cornell School of Engineering and others. And, no. PSE&G Long Island does not provide Head of Terms or LOI in the manner you suggest. Zoning is as current use farm land, development rights still in place. The majority of utility-scale solar projects in Suffolk County are constructed on farm land. Permitting is a 30-90 day process, administered, reviewed and approved by the Township of Southold.  As there are existing solar farms in Southold, we do not foresee any issues arising.  For over a year we have been holding in depth discussions with the Township, and have been led to believe that there should be no permitting problems with our planned solar farm. Glad to provide AECOM\u2019s guarantee details when we have them. Same with the equipment information once specifics are in place. We have manufacturing partnerships in the U.S., China and South Korea. ",

I\u2019m not suggesting anything, I\u2019m just trying to get some concrete answers for my questions\u2026 As it is now, I\u2019m afraid I just can\u2019t assess the risks (zoning, permitting, equipment, equity structure, PPA\u2026), therefore I\u2019d suggest to fellow Makers to give this project a pause and to reconvene once there\u2019s more clarity and more risks mitigated. To be on the constructive side. Honestly speaking, and I\u2019m really trying to be helpful here \u2013 having the landowner as part of the project takes a huge cost out of the picture (you can agree with him to refinance some land cost later on); once you have the land in the Project Co. you can fairly quickly address the Zoning and Permitting risks by applying for a construction permit; once you have this then I guess you\u2019d have the PPA in hand already, and then you are a king of the jungle Sir! Given you have some equity allocated for this project and no need to incur the land cost you shall be able, with some small amount of money, to turn this project around by the end of the year. If that happens, you can count on me not only supporting this then, but to be a fierce advocate of such well-prepared project. Who knows, maybe even on more preferable terms than currently but that\u2019s for the RWF team to decide. Again, these are just my personal thoughts and recommendations. Take good care, G ",
