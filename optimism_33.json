One of the unique strengths of Optimism is Ethereum Equivalence, it isn\u2019t just EVM compatible, but is designed to operate almost exactly like mainnet. This means porting smart contracts across is as simple as possible, gas works the same, opcodes work the same, it means Optimism can adopt all the same EIPs as Ethereum with minimal extra work. Basically it\u2019s an amazing advantage over just about everything else. If we stopped using Ethereum for gas and switched to using OP we would be sacrificing all of that to what gain? The OP collected as gas would need to be sold for ether in order to pay the mainnet fees anyway so all it would really do is add an extra step to that process.

If Optimism were to collect gas fees in OP, they would still need to pay the L1 fees in ether, so they would have to sell the OP they just collected and buy ETH\u2026 so what would be the gain? On the other hand, we\u2019d lose some of the advantages of Ethereum Equivalence which make Optimism stand out over other rollups. It just doesn\u2019t make sense as a sacrifice for no benefit! ",

I\u2019m not sure all of these people that are blindly in favor of this silly idea have taken a moment to really think about this at all and are just thinking somewhat selfishly and narrowly about the price of OP going up.  I\u2019m no expert on optimistic rollups but I have to assume that the current eth fees we are paying are collectively used to pay for on-chain transactions which is how the L2 network is able to utilize the advanced security and functionality of the ethereum network.  So, if the native token to pay fees on Optimism is OP, then what is the exact process for paying the eth fee for those on-chain benefits exactly?  Do you also have to add a clunky and unecessary process in which the OP paid for fees is swapped for ETH in order to remain being an L2 network with the benefits of L1 ethereum?  Fairly sure this is a simple issue to be addressed with this completely pointless proposal which has the main benefit of adding complexity to this process. Now, to address this claim, which is the backbone of this boneheaded suggestion, that governance tokens have no value or real use is just an indication that this person and those agreeing with them have absolutely no ability think about the future of this space 5 or 10 years down the road.  It has yet to really take hold very well, but eventually a decentralized governance program and the token that enables it is going to be incredibly valuable with further adoption as this space, DeFi and Web3 continue to mature.  Having voting power in multiple major projects with a robust history which helps to prove longevity of the biggest players in DeFi will be similar to the power of a wall street bank. In closing - this is a terrible idea unless someone can correct me on the fee issue i described above.  That seems like a pointless cash grab in the short term from a bunch of WSB moon boys which is a major change for this L2 system/network that hasn\u2019t been considered. Edit: i replied to someone making the same fee point i was - Sorry for duplication of info. ",

The current governance token will naturally evolve over time and have very different functionality than it does now. I agree with you in that such a switch is a huge distraction from the clearly stated mission of the project. That said I don\u2019t think a \u201cpure\u201d governance token is a good idea but the sort of hybrid that would come out of this discussion is worse. Basically, tokens can either be a loyalty-point (permissioned) or money-like (nearly permissionless). Or a plurality of tokens can be used as a form of access control. Obviously, fungible tokens are more the former and NFTs the latter. Pure Governance tokens are basically FTs with various systems around them to make them enough like NFTs that governance can happen, but it\u2019s kludge-y and the fluidity of the system is counterproductive. Sorry, that was a bit of a ramble. ",

Then other questions, how can the sequencer take advantage of the mechanism? disfigures its role as a governance token? However it\u2019s too early for the token to discuss it, and evidently Optimism have been thinking about other plans for OP like transaction ordering and incentives/relationship between sequencers and verifiers, and for now, full governance.

Currently, the CALLVALUE opcode returns the amount of Ether sent to a contract. If the OP token is accepted as the gas token, how will this opcode work? Will it return the Ether amount or the OP amount sent to the contract? This can potentially break a lot of contracts. Has the implementation been thought through? How is this going to be achieved? What happens to the users without OP in their wallets, are they stuck without any gas? Finally, assuming that all the technical issues are solved, what are the benefits of accepting OP as a gas token?  ",

If the L2 token can only be used as a vote, what is the significance of the L2 project token? Where is the motivation of investors or participants? Buying or selling tokens is a real gold and silver transaction. In the end, the unsupported tokens will fall, and the profitability of the project side in the ecology will also become very lacking, because the L2 level fee is very low and can be ignored. , the only source of profit for the project party is to issue coins and earn money from investors, which is a very bad and unsustainable situation. The status of ETH at the L1 level is unshakable. Any ecology that operates in the L1 has achieved good development and sustainable momentum. ETH itself has also appeared a lot of content that maintains the currency price and investors\u2019 income.

I would encourage anyone asking about where token value will come from to read this OP Economics | Optimism Docs. It\u2019s a well thought out proposition that token value is often truly based on ecosystem profitability and not quick moves to try and pump a token.  Think of the gnosis token, a governance token that isn\u2019t really used on the gnosis chain except through validators, but it\u2019s value come in part from the influence of a massive treasury around the productive elements of the ecosystem the team birthed (gnosis safe, dxdao, cowswap, Etc.) Eth isn\u2019t where it is because of its burn function, it is where it is because of it amazing utility and the massive ecosystem utilising it\u2019s security and the proceeding gigantic market cap.  The use case of the token will continue to evolve but to make this change without some good reasons on how it will add to the ecosystem value seems short sighted.  As has already been brought up, it probably would not have the intended effect anyway, it would have to be transferred into eth and this would create sell pressure, it can\u2019t just be burned as those fees are necessary for security. I can see OP serving as a possible validator stake in the future but only if that was the best thing for the ecosystem.

Enabling $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network! \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       Enabling $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network!     The  $OP token can be used to pay gas fees on the Optimism Network!. This is a major addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption and usage of the Optimism Network!.  ETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change to $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!  Be\u2026     Enabling $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network!    The $OP token can be used to pay gas fees on the Optimism Network!. This is a major addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption and usage of the Optimism Network!. ETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change to $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount! Benefits The Optimism token already has significant utility on the network, and this improvement will unify usage of $OP as the fees token for all Optimism Networks. Currently, $OP is used for voting and delegating votes in the Optimism Network. This can incentivize bridging since we can airdrop a small amount of $Op for first time users of the network. It will also prevent the need to bridge both ETH and for Optimism Network usage. Additional benefits: Increased trading volume for $OP Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass Increase the price of the $OP. $Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets. Increased user choice on the network. Makes it easier for bridging. Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage Technical Details Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers, The Graph indexing, wallets, the gateway, and overall developer and user experience. We are proposing an opt-in strategy where users can, if they wish, pay for fees in $OP. This fee choice will be recorded in an L2 contract. Changing the fee token will require interacting with this feeChoice contract. To reduce friction points for new users, a second system of contracts will be built that allows users without ETH on L2 to change their fee setting to $OP, using a MetaTransaction, in which Optimism Network pays the ETH to change their fee token setting in return for OP from the user. This means that for new users, they will only need to bridge OP to Optimism to then use its full range of services, contracts, and DAPS What Does this Mean for User experience? If you want to continue to use ETH to pay for transactions on the Optimism Network, you don\u2019t have to do anything.If you want to pay for transactions in $OP, select $OP, and confirm the transaction. After that, all future transactions will be charged in $OP. Users will be able to switch between $OP and $ETH as the fee token. Conclusion $OP Token Receives Utility Boost, Use for Gas Fees on Optimism Network Credits goes to - Zukaboba ",

                    "content": " Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!  How does this work? The fees you pay on Optimism are used directly to pay for gas to post proofs/data onto Ethereum L1. So if you give a discount of 25% on gas fees paid in $OP, Optimism will be operating at a loss, effectively subsidising your gas costs. Where is the benefit in that for Optimism?  Additional benefits: Increased trading volume for $OP Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass Increase the price of the $OP. $Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets.  These arguments are all about the same thing: price go up. Which is a bad argument for a governance token and will not even be the case as Optimism will need to sell the $OP collected as gas fees to cover mainnet fees.  Makes it easier for bridging.  Bridging what? $OP is a token native to optimism and doesn\u2019t exist or have any utility on other (L1/L2) networks. Also all bridges currently support bridging ETH to and from optimism, not $OP. So how does it make bridging easier?  Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage  This is solving an issue that does not exist. There is no need to bridge both ETH and $OP to use optimism, you just need ETH. ",

We can ignore supply for this proposal and only focus on demand. Demand for OP will likely come from two sources:  Staking demand to earn sequencer revenues Reservation demand, e.g. as a money-like instrument or gas token  Sequencer revenue is primarily a function of providing the best possible UX to Optimism devs/users. Forcing users to hold OP would improve the reservation demand but at the cost of much worse UX - ultimately hurting demand more than helping it. Instead, I think the natural endgame is for all execution layers to abstract away fees entirely and let users pay in one of many major tokens, pay from a secondary account, pay from the output of their trades, or with MEV, etc. This is the best possible UX and this will maximize usage of Optimism and ultimately demand for the OP token more than any other strategy.

There are many other L2 project tailing OP closely and they should focus on improving the L2, which they are already doing. Its other way around actually, adaptation and usage might bring value to $OP.  sing $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!  what ? why ?  significant utility on the network  like what ? apart from gov token, I dont see any ?  Increased trading volume for $OP  True, but is this the mail goal here? increasing the value of $OP or on boarding other billion people to this new fast moving cyber space ?  (1)  Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass  what ? total market cap of what ? $OP or the value bridged to OP ecosystem. ? That never gonna work long term, I already see challenges with Phase 0 proposals where most projects are focusing on giving incentives, in $OP, for using the project. This is a huge challenge and will fail long term. Do you really thing people will stay once the incentive dry up or they see better option? Remember other L2s are watching us.  Increase the price of the $OP  and ? check above (1)  Increased user choice on the network.  this one i agree.  Makes it easier for bridging.  is it already easy, once click and boom you are on L2 from main chain  Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage  what? need more information here ? please explain,may be with an example ?  Technical Details  this one is fine, I am from business background and limited understanding on contract. For sake of discussion, I agree, what you are saying might work and user will be able to choose between ETH/OP, now you tell me, how this will encourage a user to bridge to OP ecosystem ? Here is my example, why it wont. Lets say, as a user, I want to take a loan from Compound and I can do this directly on settlement layer, or on an L2, like OP or Arbitrum, to save some fee. Now, having an option to pay fee in $OP/ETH has nothing to do with my need, I will choose the protocol which is fast, cheap and has better fraud proof algo implemented. Other way around might work, if OP chain is fast, cheap and has better fraud proof tech, I might consider paying in $OP but we are far from there, arent we ? ",

I am under the impression the only genuine argument for this proposal is $OP token price will go up - I\u2019m highly against using this metric to make governance decisions.   Accepting $OP and $ETH as gas (or just $OP) requires the protocol to make DEX swaps buying $ETH to pay L1 fees and likely to pay L2 validators. This requires Optimism chain to chose a DEX - showing favor to a non-native application on its chain. This proposal requires the Blockchain to pick a favorite DEX -imo this is not an option, and goes against the ethos of general purpose blockchains.   This breaks Ethereum equivalence and goes against the mission of Optimism. It destroys the dev experience of porting over Ethereum applications without additional overhead and contract changes. We are trying to scale Ethereum, not pump $OP. linking @ayrtonb Change the use of OP tokens from a governance token to the main network token for gas payment - #49 by ayrtonb   ",

                    "content": "Some concrete reasons why using OP as a gas token is a bad idea:  Using ETH as a gas token is a massive UX improvement. I (personally) was very confused about how to make my first Polygon transaction because I had to get MATIC tokens. I have spoken to many people who have had a similar experience with Polygon. Using ETH as a gas token signals alignment with Ethereum and improves Optimism\u2019s brand as a rollup that is strongly tied to the Ethereum ecosystem. Using OP as a gas token is not a trivial task and adds complexity to the Optimism software that goes against the minimal diff + EVM Equivalence philosophy. Switching from ETH to OP exclusively seems like a non-starter, which means Optimism would have to add support for payments in both ETH and OP at the same time, which is even more complicated. Sequencer needs to pay for fees in ETH to publish transactions to L1, which means that they must have a constant stream of ETH coming in. As a result, the Sequencer would be constantly selling any OP they receive on L2 for ETH. Since Sequencer pays for fees in ETH on L1, gas prices in OP on L2 would have to consider the exchange rate between ETH and OP, meaning that we would have to include an oracle or enshrine some AMM to determine the current ETH/OP exchange rate. Would seriously increase protocol complexity.  I could keep going, but there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. We have other ways to accrue value to OP but from a practical perspective I don\u2019t think that this is a good way to do it. ",
