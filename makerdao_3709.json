                    "content": "First of all, it\u2019s great to see that the Content Production Unit is working hard to grow Maker\u2019s audience and expand its business. The pro-activity and passion are among the key factors why I believe in Maker/Dai, not only as a cryptocurrency, but also a community of like-minded people with a common goal. Secondly, during the past couple of days, I thought a bit about how Maker is currently marketed which, of course, has a direct impact on its brand image, performance, etc. Here is one point which kelp coming up to my mind (please take it only as an observation/suggestion of someone who is not directly involved in the development, but is passionate about the project): It seems to me that some of the marketing/content production activities are not fully aligned with the project\u2019s overall strategy/mission. To my understanding, Maker/Dao is \u201ca stable, decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or business can realize the advantages of digital money\u201d. Additionally, it \u201ccan be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.\u201d. These statements (which are on the project\u2019s main landing page) indicate that Maker is not only for blockchain professionals/tech-savvy people, but rather anyone who might be interested in an alternative financial system. However, the current marketing activities do not adequately showcase this in my opinion. For example, most of the published content seems very complicated and technical to me - which may create an image that Maker is only for people who understand the technology behind it - which in result may limit the project\u2019s potential. Maybe creating some less technical content would help. For instance, \u201chow to\u201d & \u201ctutorial\u201d videos are the best performing category on YouTube - also the category with the biggest potential. I did a small analysis and basic \u201chow to\u201d blockchain videos attract large audiences + have a great engagement rate. Same goes for this type of content on other social media. Next, centering some of the content around crypto in general rather than Maker/Dai might also be a great way to grow. To illustrate, instead of publishing an article about Maker\u2019s technical details, an article about how DeFi/Crypto is going to transform the financial systems could be released (of course Maker would be mentioned in the article but it wouldn\u2019t be the central point of focus of it). By doing this, you can target and promote Maker to people who are interested in crypto but are not familiar with Maker. That\u2019s it for my small analysis. Please, let me know what you think! Thanks! ",

Maker is not something simple if you think about its structure as a pawnshop in general, but DAI is perfect and serves as a spearhead to arouse the curiosity of any individual. With the section you comment on \u201ca stable, decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or business can realize the advantages of digital money\u201d. Additionally, it \u201ccan be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.\u201d Currently this premise is not fulfilled, I always comment positively that maker should stop thinking only in L1, not only because of the gas issue, we are lagging in terms of crosschain possibilities, I know that being in multiple chains has its risks, but I would like in the near future to understand that a stable coin if it wants to be successful must dominate the market and unfortunately the market is no longer only the Ethereum network are all networks that reach a large audience and boom as bsc or Polygon (which indirectly we are there).  No doubt I agree with you. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your reply, Seth! Happy to hear that the Content Production Core Unit is growing! Regarding the content itself, I recently read 2 interesting articles which might help you set the proper content strategy and guide you in the content production process. Please let me know if you can\u2019t access them - I\u2019ll send you PDFs.   Online content match-making in B2B markets: Application of neural content modeling -  this article is focused mainly on the content strategy and provides a great insight into how a digital content strategy should be developed - even though it is centered around B2B markets, most points can be applied to B2C as well.   Millennial and generation Z digital marketing communication and advertising effectiveness: A qualitative exploration - this one, on other hand, discusses the content itself, e.g. what type of content should be used, how it should be optimized, etc.   I believe these articles could be a great starting point! Perhaps the most intriguing conclusion from the papers is that the content which majority of companies produce is not aligned with their customers\u2019/potential customers\u2019 interests as orgs usually create and target their content based on demographics rather than interests (image below perfectly illustrates this issue).  image1320\u00d7711 113 KB  I\u2019ll look at blockchain/crypto-related content production - what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and mainly why, in more detail - I\u2019ll post the results here once I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll also try to stop by at your weekly meeting. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. I\u2019m more than happy to help with anything related to content/marketing/business development. Lastly, good luck with finding new people for the unit - I\u2019ll try to see if I have anyone in my network who might be interested and qualified. Have a nice day, Milan ",
