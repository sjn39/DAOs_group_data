In practice this would mean that the borrower would not be able to repay the loan, and would be at risk of losing their collateral. In addition, the actual owner of the MKR supplied on Aave would never be able to reclaim their funds (unless others decided to supply MKR.) In practice, the borrower might come out ahead if the value of MKR drops significantly after ES (which is likely,) however the lender is just screwed. Lending significant amounts of MKR on secondary platforms is really, really dangerous. Changing the ESM amount is not a good solution though, it\u2019s specifically supposed to be possible to trigger it with a minority of MKR to defend against a majority governance attack. ",
