Tooling Project description: LI.FI enables a future multi-chain world by reducing complexity to navigate the fragmented landscape of bridges and DEXs across chains. The easy-to-use widget and SDK allow developers to easily integrate cross-chain capabilities into any existing product. With that users can move and swap assets without having to choose the right bridge or worry about available liquidity. Apart from the B2C showcase transferto.xyz (originally designed as a demo, now already driving a lot of traffic) more and more products are integrating LI.FI as the go-to bridge aggregator. Examples of current integrations are Alchemix, SpiritSwap, Frontier Wallet, Rubic, Etherspot, Treehouse, or specifically on Optimism: DeFi Saver, Perpetual Protocol, Etherspot, Superfluid, Omni. There are further contracts signed and tests running with bigger integration partners such as the largest wallets in the space (>20M monthly active users), which will then enable driving even more liquidity to Optimism through LI.FI.

No (on several chains, 17 in total) Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: December 2021 Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Users often have tokens on other chains and would like to use dApps on Optimism. For projects or dApps it\u2019s significant development effort to be multi-chain compatible and complex to navigate the current bridging landscape. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? We provide an SDK and Widget which makes it easy for projects to support OP and enable users to bridge any token to OP without having to choose a bridge or leave the dApp. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? More bridging integrations for Optimism and projects providing such within the dApp will be a key factor to enable Optimism usage and adoption. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 200,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount? N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? The co-incentives we\u2019ll provide are technical support for integrating bridging to Optimism as well as content marketing based on in-depth research. We currently value our hands-on development support at $5k-$20k per project per month. We\u2019d like to provide dev integration support valued at $20k per month (1-4 projects / month) over a time period of 6-9 months (up to $180k) in total. Apart from technical integration one of our biggest strengths is the content we produce, especially regarding the bridging space, to support understanding of emerging ecosystems. In the past we\u2019ve e.g. written the bridges articles for the Ethereum Foundation (e.g. Introduction to blockchain bridges | ethereum.org) or published educational content regarding Arbitrary Messaging Bridges. We\u2019d love to create content in terms of Optimism bridging in general (which we\u2019d be happy to white label) as well as for specific projects. Marketing channels we will use to spread such knowledge are content posts in Twitter Threads, announcement articles, cross-chain insider newsletter, substack, Q&A interviews, Twitter spaces, Discord/Telegram and additional ways on a per team basis. Proposal for token distribution: As a bridge aggregator we provide the most straight-forward path for users and projects to onboard to Optimism. We\u2019d like to support this with financial incentives for users (initial gas) to get started on Optimism as well as financial and technical support for projects to enable bridging to Optimism through LI.FI. How will the OP tokens be distributed?  Incentivize transfers to Optimism by providing initial gas for all bridges (50%)  In terms of initial gas we believe 0.003 ETH (~3.8 USD) for users after first time bridging is a good starting point to make transactions and interact with dApps on Optimism. At the current OP/ETH price we could onboard roughly ~26k new users to Optimism with that.  Support projects to integrate bridging to Optimism through LI.FI (50%)  We\u2019d like to enable more projects to support Optimism and onboard users from other chains to Optimism. For that we\u2019d like to provide different grants to such projects depending on the size and complexity of the integration. Smaller ones (<10k) for simple SDK / widget integrations and larger ones for deeper integrations including e.g. cross-chain contract calls. The priority will be for projects deployed on Optimism and seeking bridging from other chains. In addition to these grants we\u2019ll provide technical and content marketing support to such projects, especially larger ones. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Currently we expect the time period for distribution to be around 6-9 months. This may vary though depending on market development, developer/user adoption, project integration speeds and further external factors. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? The initial gas amounts will make it easier and more financially attractive for users to move assets to Optimism and start using dApps there. The financial and technical support for bridge integration will enable more projects to easily allow their users to adopt Optimism coming from other chains. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. KPI for initial gas incentives:  number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism  KPIs for project support to integrate OP bridging:  number of projects support total amount of financial support / grants given out to these projects number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism (same as above as requested in feedback comments)  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Over time users will be used to the UX of bridging to OP and enjoy the simplicity of being able to do so directly through different dApps\u2019 integrated swapping/bridging capabilities powered by LI.FI. This improved first user experience with dApps on OP will provide a great entry point for more long-term usage.

The most efficient way for us to stop farming gas stipends by sybils is by simply making it financially unattractive due to the gas stipend amount in comparison to payable bridge fee (e.g. 2-3 USD), so a sybil / bot won\u2019t have a viable net gain from that. We\u2019ve just further reduced the gas stipend amount to 0.003 ETH (~3.8 USD), which gives even less of an incentive to farm gas stipends.   KPIs 2a. We currently mainly tracking bridge transactions, but I agree for activity further TXs on OP would be great. Happy to align and find ways together how to best monitor that. 2b. Agree, added that above.   Yes, here some examples of projects to support with a LI.FI integration and OP bridging: Gamma (already on OP, add bridging), Pika Protocol (already on OP, add bridging), Dexible (add OP support), Rhino, Velodrome, Midas, Merlin (Valk), Apwine, Alpha Homora, etc. Additional deeper integrations (e.g. Perp) can be found in my answer above.   We\u2019ve just reduced the overall number of OP tokens further to 200k to accommodate the higher sybil resistance with smaller initial gas and reduce usage time span for this proposal. We\u2019d rather establish a long-term relationship with the OP ecosystem and continue with follow-up proposals in the future. Happy to answer more questions / discuss further. ",

                    "content": " 1. Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.). To begin with, for this proposal we identified a possible conflict of interest between our team member (@cryptotesters involved in Hop protocol) and thus that individual was excluded from assessing this proposal.  2. About the project  There is plethora of bridges of various designs out there**.** There is also vast amount of tokens, some with native cheap bridging solutions. Bridge aggregators try to find the best path to move (and possible exchange) tokens from one chain to another and are important primitive. In a nutshell, LiFi works in a way that a centralized backend provides routing information that is fed to and executed by decentralized smart contract system. LiFi itself doesn\u2019t operate a bridge but rather aggregates already existing solutions. LiFi supports Optimism for a while now. As far as we can tell, there are no plans for LiFi token. Similar OP Governance proposals:   Socket Protocol - 500k OP  Hop Protocol - 1M OP  Across Protocol - 750k OP   3. About the following  Proposal was posted back in August and recently updated to fit new template. LiFi team was quick to answer any additional questions asked by community members.  4. About the proposal valuation  In this part, we focus on the following aspects:   Added value (good to bad): good. Bridge aggregators are the best products to use for many types of users.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. Aggregators are important but it\u2019s a crowded space with many competing solutions.  Current Status [Development stage/\u00bfOpen Source?] (early to ready): ready.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. Funds will be used to subsidize product usage as well as fund more integrations. This is quite in line with similar proposals.  Amount requested (high to low): low/medium    5. KPIs and impact tracking We suggest tracking following KPIs:  Users bridged Users who bridged and stayed active  Same KPIs should apply to subsidised integrations. Further more, gas stipends should be monitored to detect any sybil-like behaviour.  6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes  We apologize for the delays during this cycle. Our work was mostly done on time but we had delays with the final confirmation from each member to properly publish our recommendations with the proper consensus (this was due to devcon week, but we recognize this is not an excuse). We promise that this situation will not happen again and we will carry out the respective improvements of the process and we will share our learnings received during this cycle. Thank you for patience. ",
