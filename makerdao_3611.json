My first thoughts are that the downside would be making the DAO formally under the purview of US laws. But the upside would be liability protection for holders of MKR. I should note on that second point that I hold my MKR inside an S Corp, and recommend anyone who isn\u2019t pseudonymous to use an LLC, corporate entity, or some other form of personal liability shield to hold their MKR. I am not a lawyer but I am paranoid when it comes to litigation. Whether that is more or less personal liability protection than the DAO being a registered entity in Wyoming, I don\u2019t know. ",
