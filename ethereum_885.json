The idea of using the twitter as a medium was to leverage its RE/RT functionality as the way create a Q/A tree going deep in two dimensions Why1->Why2->Why3->\u2026 and WhyX->[A1,A2,A3,\u2026] instead of single thread here. Here I would collect results of this branstorming and suggest a place for long discussions. It is just an experiment and I am curious if it will work. This thread was extracted from Funding and ETH1x started by @boris to keep his thread clear.  # EthCore5Whys  and  # Why1 ,  # Why2 \u2026 tags for easier evaluation. ",

It seems a very convoluted way to re-create the features of decent forum software.   This is not the goal that anyone follows the whole discussion tree. It is sufficient of to create the tree of questions and answers. We can collect all Q&A posts from specific level just by searching tags #Why1,  #Why2 \u2026 #Why5. ",
