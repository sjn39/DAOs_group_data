Join @Akiva, who posted the initial proposal, on Zoom 2021-10-07T21:00:00Z to learn more about Pairwyse and how it compares and contrasts with the other two proposals for fixed-rate vaults (here and here). The proposal includes the development of a Smart Contract for managing Forward-Rate Agreements (FRA), which create fixed-rate options for borrowers and lenders. Can\u2019t make the call? No problem! Keep your eyes out for the recordings and transcripts on the following channels:  Youtube Podcast Transcripts  Leave your questions below and we\u2019ll see you on the call! @Recognized-Delegates ",

Pairwyse Solution Architecture:     [Discussion] Pairwyse as a Solution for Fixed-Rates on MakerDAO Integrations       We\u2019d like to share an out-of-box solution for the provision of fixed-rate DAI loans of arbitrary term-length on MakerDAO through application of the Pairwyse protocol built atop Maker\u2019s credit and deposit instruments.   [image]  The Pairwyse protocol specifically solves the impossible trinity for MakerDAO by creating a fixed-rate marketplace for borrowers and lenders without restricting Maker\u2019s use of floating rates and market-driven capital flows to maintain the DAI peg and grow its supply.
