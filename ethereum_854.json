Here is the email that went out: https://md.spade.builders/lXX8_RxoRGyr6zunhmTuqQ  Please also use this thread for feedback for those that attended, those that viewed the livestream, or those with other comments   Potential Next Meeting Here are two polls to gather feedback on timing and location of a next meeting.  We have one volunteer @meknab who has said she can help out on the ground \u2026     Talking to @shemnon, let\u2019s schedule an online conference. Danno would present an Asiago April 2020 hardfork plan, and by then we\u2019ve likely got a ton of Istanbul topics that would benefit from live discussion. I\u2019ll suggest Tuesday July 23rd, 7am to 11am PST. ",

If anything can make this easier, getting it into Istanbul would be good, or at least planning for the April hardfork. See @cdetrio\u2019s thread:   twitter.com          Casey Detrio (cdetrio)     I'm guessing other devs and researchers are starting to have similar thoughts, iterating on the idea of an eth1-eth2 bridge. And I'm excited to see what they'll propose.  3:26 PM - 1 Jun 2019     6            ",
