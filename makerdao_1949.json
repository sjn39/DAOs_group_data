                    "content": "Hello Community, It has been very rewarding joining this community, learning the mechanisms, and evolving a summary that goes out into the world regarding governance happenings and issues.  I am extremely excited about the Self-Sustaining MakerDAO initiative and would like to provide more utility for the community with the work I do. To that end, the cycle of Urgency, Apathy, Distraction, and Denial was brought up and pretty much accurately nailed down a behavior cycle within the group.  I am just gathering feedback about the idea of starting a \u201cDispositioned Governance Agenda\u201d site.  Now, I figured that this would not be a signaling issue, because I\u2019m not proposing any kind of procedure, rather a resource for watching how work is moving through the governance system. If you read this week\u2019s issue of DAI-gest (due out in just hours) you will see that I have created this section for the weekly summary which dispositions governance topics as NEW, MOVING, STALLED, or COMPLETED.  I was thinking about starting a site, dashboard if you will, that is updated weekly that shows how the item is moving.  Because of the different arenas for communicating, updating would be a manual task, but relatively easy.  Items would have a title, include a timer function that starts when the item is introduced, and a description of where the item was last seen moving.  Clicking the item will take you to a brief description of the item, relevant forum thread links (or other links that may apply)  and a list of any applicable issue owners or group members.  The mechanism for deciding the disposition of items would be as follows:  New: Item proposed within the last two weeks in the forum or on the governance and risk call. Moving: One or all of these situations would keep an item in moving status: Evolving discussion in the forum or on the Governance and Risk call.  An action item was created or completed for the item.  The item has been delegated to a group or individual.  The item is polling or has polled within the last week.  The item is currently in an open executive vote. Stalled:  The item has no visible discussion or movement forward in the previous two weeks. Completed:  The item has passed executive vote or otherwise reached a logical conclusion by means of a deliverable OR the item is not going to be further pursued through an obvious consensus.  Everything would be completely objective.  No opinions.  As the governance paradigm rolls out, it would show MIPS that were open, passed, or returned/vetoed.  It would contain a directory of all the elected paid contributors that is categorized in sensible ways for searching work groups and individuals, and a voter delegate directory that would show the number of people they are representing, total amount of maker they are voting with, voting record, a Voter Delegate Statement which is a summary of how they think/vote/rationale\u2026etc.   Again, I am not trying to propose anything procedural, rather just trying to step up as a part of the community to present and own an informational resource for the governance group.  Really just seeking an opinion on the agenda portion and throwing out the other future stuff (MIPS, EPCs, Delegates) as food for thought.  Please give me your feedback.  Also, how is DAI-gest working for everyone?  Suggestions and comments are welcome.  I ultimately serve the community, and want to make sure that the information you get out if it, or that it presents to the outside, is helpful.  Sorry if there are typo\u2019s in this, just trying to get it out of my head and into the world. Many thanks, Adrian ",

I kinda of like it because it makes sense in this context, but maybe give some thought to a different name? No strong feelings either way. ",
