Bank capitalization metrics can provide some useful insight. The global banking system generally requires regulated financial institutions to maintain core capital ratios of 4%, meaning that their balance sheet common equity needs to be 4% of their total assets. However, in this context the common equity is not the total market capitalization of common shares, but the book value of equity (assets minus liabilities). In the context of the MCD system, the 500k DAI surplus buffer compared with the current DAI supply of ~85MM DAI is equivalent to ~0.6% core capital ratio. If the MCD system had 4% core capital on Black Thursday (4% of ~100MM DAI, ~4MM DAI), this would have been sufficient to absorb the majority of the losses. As a first step, I\u2019d be interested in gauging sentiment on changing the DAI surplus threshold from the current 500k DAI. I\u2019d also love to hear any other perspectives on reserve management  Summary of Thread and its comments     less than 500,000 DAI 500,000 DAI (current value) 750,000 DAI 1,000,000 DAI 1,500,000 DAI 2,000,000 DAI more than 2,000,000 DAI     0 voters     ",

If we collect lots of DAI into the surplus buffer during times of positive sentiment then we\u2019ll have plenty of DAI available to initiate flap auctions on the next downturn. Taking this idea to the next level, we could add capabilities to the protocol to allow the protocol to place limit orders in the MKR/DAI order book (e.g., on Oasis). Using the surplus buffer, we could place limit buy orders at the bottom of the range and limit sell orders at some crazy high P/E ratio (100-200).

                    "content": "Well, I won\u2019t advocate too much for crypto assets as a reserve because it is unclear to me how they would fare in a bear market, and recent events seem to indicate that they don\u2019t fare too well. So what kind of \u201creal world\u201d assets make sense? There is the obvious choice of USD, or in this case synthetic USD in the form of DAI. This is probably a great choice as a reserve but it comes with the downside of actually taking DAI out of the markets decreasing the token\u2019s overall utility. I kind of agree with Cyrus that we could probably go overboard there. Taking out say 4% of the DAI supply as mentioned in this thread is probably fine but I would start to become skeptical once you had say 10% of the DAI supply earmarked for the surplus buffer. I highly recommend watching the risk team\u2019s presentation on VaR at this point because it is kind of a prereq for the rest of my discussion. Depending on what you found the VaR to be it may not be necessary to hold anything other than DAI for reserve purposes, but if the VaR is much larger than ~8MM (10% of DAI supply) you might need to consider holding something else. So what is our second choice? Normally I would think \u201crisk-free\u201d assets like 10-year T-Notes would be a good option for something like this, but IDK that there has been any effort to bring those on-chain at this point. As such, I don\u2019t think that would even be an option in the medium term. There probably is some way that you could set up a trust or similar legal entity that would be funded by the protocol and buy the T-Notes for you, but that starts to introduce counterparty risks. Additionally, it\u2019s probably worth noting that uncle sam would likely not be fond of US debt being used to back a stablecoin like DAI. So what, IMO, is a decent 3rd choice? Gold. Gold historically fairs well during market downturns. It tends to be cheap to buy during bullish market cycles and usually sees price appreciation during times of market stress. There probably are fewer regulatory concerns with gold-backed synthetic assets as things like Gold certificates and Gold ETFs have existed for some time. There is precedent for holding gold as a reserve asset. The US for instance only officially abandoned the gold standard in 1976. Finally and most importantly in my opinion is that there are already on-chain mechanisms that can be used to gain gold exposure. I already mentioned PAXG as an option there but if we thought the counterparty risk was too high in that instance there are other options such as sXAU. I don\u2019t expect this to be a popular opinion though, so criticism is welcome. Obviously the question of the system buffer size is more of a pressing issue as it is the only option that could be feasibly implemented in the short term. Like I said, I\u2019m just interested in hearing how people feel about holding non-dai assets for reserve purposes generally, and wanted to share my thoughts on what might be reasonable options. ",

                    "content": "Given the current low SF, it will take a long time for a substantial surplus to build up just from operating cashflow. I know that the idea of \u201cpre-printing\u201d MKR was brought up on the call last week, and while I would be supportive of issuing capital to build up the surplus buffer, we could potentially issue other types of capital instead of just equity. Traditional banks often issue financial instruments called contingent convertible bonds as a supplemental source of reserves in addition to common equity. During normal times, the instrument works like a bond, paying a fixed rate of return from the date of issuance until the full face value of the bond is repaid at maturity. However, the bonds have built in triggers which allow for them to be converted into common equity at a predetermined price under certain circumstances. An example of how this could work in the Maker system: Each convertible bond is represented via an ERC20 token (BOND). Each BOND has a face value of 200 DAI, and will be redeemable on or after the maturity date of the BOND. BONDs are sold via auction at a discount to the face value price of 200 DAI, with the discounted price and term length implying the buyer\u2019s yield to maturity. Proceeds of the auction would be held in a segregated account, and would be topped up to 200 DAI per BOND from the system\u2019s DAI surplus to make up for the original issue discount. Some numbers to make this more concrete: Par value per bond/value at maturity: 200 DAI Term: 91 Days (13 weeks) Cost at issuance: 195 DAI Based on the cost at issuance, face value, and term, the buyer of the above BOND would earn an annualized return of roughly 10% over the 13 week term. Note that Maker would need to top up the 195 DAI supplied by the buyer with 5 DAI from the surplus in order to fully back the BOND. Whenever a flop auction occurs during the term of the BOND, proceeds from the segregated account would be used to make the initial bid of 50,000 DAI (200 DAI per MKR). Any uncontested auctions won by the BOND account would convert a portion of each BOND\u2019s maturity value from DAI to MKR. BOND holders would be able to earn a fixed return on their DAI in excess of money market rates, in exchange for taking on the risk of potentially acquiring MKR at an above market price. MKR holders would be able to limit the insolvency risk of the system overall, and in the case of MKR price performing well, the overall cost of capital would be lower than printing MKR tokens directly. In the medium term once DAI supply improves, issuing \u201cdebt\u201d capital instruments like this could be a more cost effective way to control the liquid DAI supply, and on a macro level it could help the system sustain a wider DSR spread. This also avoids some potential issues @cyrus eluded to about the risks of holding substantial assets on the balance sheet. Because Maker doesn\u2019t hold the DAI free and clear, it would not be at risk of governance attack or other asset stripping maneuvers. ",

Though convertible bonds are cool. Sort of the opposite of a normal convertible bond, it\u2019s more like MKR holders are buying a put option. An interesting way of purchasing insurance.  I do think it\u2019s a good idea when the stability fee is high to build up DAI reserves. There are many benefits:  a buffer in case of liquidation losses won\u2019t need to cyclically sell and buy MKR. Also, the big one is that holding DAI has a positive return for MKR holders. DAI held in reserve, effectively earn the SF. It may also suppress the SF a bit which is good for growth of DAI, less sf volatility DAI reserves could possibly be used to purchase non DAI reserves. (when low sf AND dai persistently above peg)   (Also MakerDAO will also be effectively able to earn the sf on the convertible bonds too, it also becomes more like a fixed rate product for bond holders if they value the cost of selling a put option as low) (These put options could also be less costly for MakerDAO to sell if they have a floating interest rate (earn the DSR as a coupon), depends whether there\u2019s more demand for a fixed interest rate product or variable) ",

I feel like having a much larger Dai reserve makes sense for the mid-term, and we look into holding reserves in other assets at a later date. I think the sensible next iteration of reserve policy is to:  Accumulate large Dai reserves during periods of high SF (reserves equalling 5-10% of total Dai.) Sell accumulated reserves to burn MKR when the Dai peg is high and we\u2019ve hit 0% SF / DSR.  This would appear to have the following advantages:  Dai liquidity at the time we most need it. Reserves to balance potential bad debt. MKR burn at a time when MKR is probably trading at a lower price.  At the cost of:  No MKR burned during reserve accumulation. Potentially difficult to release the reserves quickly without overwhelming keepers. Assuming we had 1mil DAI of reserves, even dropping 1mil DAI per week would require 100 parallel FLIP auctions per week (with current auction parameters)  On balance it seems like a win. ",

In times of uncertainty when emergency shutdown become a possibility, the price of Dai will trend towards the expected payout in an emergency shutdown. If that payout is significantly more than 1 USD per dai, then it creates a self-reinforcing effect where uncertainty causes the peg to break, increasing the likelihood of an emergency shutdown. All in all, while the intention of increasing the size of the buffer is to increase robustness of the system, it may actually have the opposite effect and make it more fragile and susceptible to cascading failure. The solution is the theoretical guardian system of legally bound entities that hold reserves and use them according to pre-defined logic to prevent MKR dilution and reimburse dai holders in the event of a dai haircut. They would need to be distributed across many jurisdictions to minimize the likelihood of failure, and it will take a lot of effort to get it set up in a legally compliant and safe manner, but it is so far the best option available that is future-proofed, and doesn\u2019t negatively interact with the game theory of the core system mechanics. IMO it is less problematic to mess around with the buffer if it is just for shorter durations, but a very bad direction to go when looking for long term solutions. ",

Growth is great and all, but probably going to be difficult in this climate despite our best efforts. We just had a round of \u201cangel funding\u201d that we used to write-off the system debt. Here (with the BOND option) we would presumably be asking those same people to come to the table with a few million more DAI so we could sure up our balances, so what happens if it is not enough and MKR issuance happens again? Do those investors keep coming to the table for this money pit? IDK. My vote would actually be to start slowly raising the LR a few basis points at a time to de-risk, and we can worry about making DAI loans more attractive once things stabilize in the financial markets globally. Just my opinion though.     rune:  The solution is the theoretical guardian system of legally bound entities that hold reserves and use them according to pre-defined logic to prevent MKR dilution and reimburse dai holders in the event of a dai haircut   Hey that kind of sounds like my option two ! I personally think this is a great idea, but I worry it would take years to properly setup. In the meantime though, we are unable to keep enough cash on our books, so we might want to consider a trade-off. I mentioned building the reserves onchain with synthetic gold assets as my 3rd choice. Curious what your thoughts are on that @rune. To me it seems like the preferable option in the short/medium term because it seems straight forward to implement and could always be dissolved/redistributed once these \u201ctrusts\u201d were setup.

If we have a malicious shutdown then I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d be more screwed than in the general case? It\u2019s also hard to see how a malicious shutdown would be expected by the market. If the ES was unexpected by the market then we wouldn\u2019t have the issue of the market pricing in the value of the reserves in the case of ES. Like bottom line, MKR Holders have no incentive to shutdown while reserves are unbalanced by bad debt, we don\u2019t gain anything, it just gives Dai Holders more collateral. In that situation we can always (and should always?) wait for the reserves to be erased. The average Dai user will probably know nothing about this, but it\u2019s fair to say the \u2018advanced\u2019 Dai user would both know that Dai Holders get a share of the reserves and that because of this there is no reason for MKR Holders to ES the system while reserves exceed bad debt.

I\u2019m not convinced there isn\u2019t a case where the twisted incentives can play out over a period of time that is too short for governance to react, so I still think it would only be appealing as a temporary measure until something better is in place. There are also other problems, including dai holders being incentivized to trigger ES in edge cases, and technical ES (from e.g. a governance attack) resulting in dai holders getting additional funds. Either way I think having actual off chain reserves that behave differently depending on the scenario (so e.g. an ES during a black swan event means the value goes to dai holders, while an ES during normal conditions results in the reserves carrying over to the new deployment) is better for the long run as it avoids these issues entirely.

If that payout is significantly more than 1 USD per dai, then it creates a self-reinforcing effect where uncertainty causes the peg to break, increasing the likelihood of an emergency shutdown. All in all, while the intention of increasing the size of the buffer is to increase robustness of the system, it may actually have the opposite effect and make it more fragile and susceptible to cascading failure.    Discussion also touched on:  The potential benefits of having a larger pool of reserves, and costs (in MKR dilution) of having low reserves Which assets should the protocol hold as reserves: DAI, other on-chain assets (ETH, PAXG, etc) and/or off-chain assets and relationships with guardian entities The potential of using hedging strategies (options, etc) to build loss capacity Whether the DAI surplus buffer should be a fixed amount or targeted to a percentage of the circulating DAI supply    Thank you to everyone who contributed!

Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to take DAI surplus which one would use as system reserves and general operating funds and convert them into other stablecoin assets:   USDC, PAX, USDT, whatever. This idea originated to buy assets generally (ideally anticorrelated to collateral) and use them to deal directly with injecting and removing DAI liquidity but seems to be applicable to system reserves and general funding uses of capital. Example:   PEG is above $1.   Sell DAI and buy USDC, PAX, USDT.   Bank these in the System Reserves.   In effect one is providing DAI liquidity via direct injection to the markets.    Reverse this when one wants to remove liquidity when PEG is below $1.     Use these system reserves to pay out on Declarations of Intent add as a system buffer, operating funds, etc. This same mechanism is easily applied to system reserves generally and allows for use of system reserves for DAI liquidity management via direct injection/removal as well as a source of operating funds.   In this sense then we can grow system reserves indefinitely.   Personally I\u2019d rather use this secondary system reserve to manage buying MKR via flop type auctions. While some of what I am suggesting here may require some contract changes other parts of it can be dealt with manually.    In principle instead of having automatic MKR purchases when surplus buffer is hit we could just send that DAI into the system reserve.    Then we can have governance choose whether and how much system reserve to use to purchase and burn MKR.    This is a definite change to how the system works and something MKR holders might not like.   But if you look at this from how publicaly traded corporations deal cash management and stock buybacks it is very much the same mechanically.   When it comes to building system value, building operating capital is a key component  to that, buying back stock is another when one doesn\u2019t want to pay dividends. ",

As I stated before my personal preference would probably be to buy tokenized gold (ala PAXG) vs usd stable tokens as it seems to me be less of a regulatory risk in the medium term. With things like GLD already in existence it seems less likely to me that PAXG is going to run into future legal trouble by bringing that on chain. All these USD equivalents on the other hand seem to have gotten a lot of regulatory interest in recent months so it may be wise to be wary there. Assets aside what you are saying is more or less how i think the reserve might work. It gets dai that it sells for SOMETHING else. We store value in SOMETHING. Then later when we need more DAI we sell SOMETHING for DAI. ",

Remember I first proposed this whole system reserve from a DAI liquidity direct injection/removal mechanic. PEG > 1 (usually times are tight markets dying for DAI) BUY assets with DAI to provide DAI liquidity PEG < 1 (markets are good) sell assets for DAI to remove liquidity. The reason why stablecoins are probably the best here is that we really want the system reserve to try to maintain a constant USD value and not end up buying PAXG when price is high, and selling PAXG when prices is low.  It is not clear this will be true generally but it is why one doesn\u2019t want to have (1) one system reserve asset pony which can have a fluctuating value and (2) why one would prefer assets at least if one is managing from a cash perspective that don\u2019t fluctuate at all in value. In the loosest sense one could have two pieces to a system reserve,  assets completely uncorrelated and designed to hold USD value (it is a real debate whether USD is really the value metric vs. a basket of currencies or other values) and another system reserve that is designed to be anti-correlated with collateral price changes to act as a system buffer which should grow when system overall is being hammered with collateral price dropping. Personally I\u2019d like to spread out centralization risk.  so when it came to USDC I would favor MORE using compound cUSDC as it would earn some interest.   Not so thrilled with synthetix honestly but one could diversify this with sUSD.   Even uniswap v2 stuff might be an interesting model  do DAI:PAXG pair and or DAI:USDC etc.    Literally spread this whole reserve thing out over a lot of very different types of assets but with a clear mind to constant value ones, and anti-correlated value to collateral classes on Maker as well as spreading out centralization risk as far and wide as possible as well as paying attention to how this affects DAI liquidity when the system needs to call on it. BTW:  One very clear way to spread DAI into markets is to buy cDAI but note the way compound is structured we might not be able to get at that liquidity whereas uniswap DAI:USDC straight up is guaranteed to have capital access even if it drains market DAI liquidity to some extent.

Hey I am all for KISS but when it comes to portfolio management usually the wider the throw the better.

I like the idea of increasing our dai buffers. Purchasing dai below peg, potentially selling dai and reducing the reserves if dai is significantly above peg. It seems like the risks people are concerned about with large reserves are vague hypotheticals rather than concrete risks. Keep in mind if we begin to see any issues that have been brought up we can always decrease the reserves again in the future with minimal overhead. The liquidity issue should only be a problem when dai is significantly above peg, which is when we would be incentivized to reduce reserves anyway. ",

For instance if the protocol\u2019s VaR is <=  say $10MM sure let the protocol just hoard DAI to cover it\u2019s potential losses. That only makes up about 7% of the current DAI supply, and under normal circumstances I doubt that amount of DAI out of circulation would have much effect on peg. That said if the VaR is more like $50MM then we have another situation altogether we would be talking about hoarding almost half the DAI supply just to cover the potential losses of the protocol, and that doesn\u2019t even begin to bring in operating expenses. Definitely going to have peg issues in that case. All of this is to say that depending on what we think VaR is we may need to start to consider complex and crazy ideas just to make sure we have enough capital on hand to cover the potential losses of the protocol.

All I am really saying here is let\u2019s consider our options on how we might endeavor to be better prepared for the next rough patch we encounter, and that DEPENDING on how much money we actually need to set aside we MIGHT have to consider options outside of DAI.
