It looks like a nasty workaround for deeper problem in ethereum architecture, isn\u2019t it? Guys, we should stop use ethereum addresses as a public ids for mutable entities! We have ENS for that. It should be possible to address a contract (or even contract+function callpoint) by ENS name. I know, it requires low-level ENS integration into ethereum core and there are challenges here, but now I am asking you just about the idea. Does it make sense? What do you think? ",
