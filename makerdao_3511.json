I\u2019m not sure about opinion pieces on the official blog just yet but CommDev has recently been discussing how the meaning of \u201ccommunity\u201d changes with the transition to Core Units and what we can do to squeeze the most value out of the awesome content management system the team behind the Community Portal has created to make it easier for community members to contribute. One of the most common problems with community-generated content is the number of low-quality posts you\u2019ll inevitably receive so we do want to welcome opinion pieces and other content from the community but we also want to implement a plan for soliciting specific types of content and ensuring that readers can expect a certain level of quality. I understand that may not fully answer your question but I think that\u2019s the best we can do before our Core Unit is voted on. ",
