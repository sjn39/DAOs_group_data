I think the original justification for disabling buy-and-burn is losing legitimacy. Without that feedback the system has weaknesses, and buy/burn is at least a good-enough schelling point. On a long timeframe you can abstract any inefficiencies, even auctions that totally misfire, next to other transaction cost of auctions. And it now is becoming a \u201clong time\u201d compared to when it was disabled, I think. Just wanted to have this on record about what I believe is the right design/direction. Maybe if there is interest someone can help facilitate whatever governance stuff has to happen to revert the system to a prior state with correctly balanced incentives. ",

I\u2019m not interested in that) or what category, sorry about that.   A signal is just one way to get a proposed change onchain. It is one of the quicker mechanisms community members can utilize. In this case, the most direct way to restarting burn is to propose lowering the Surplus Buffer. But you may wish to look into recent votes and events to get a lay of the land. This item recently passed, which would buyback and burn 3M MKR over three months: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWCy8Bc#poll-detail However, a few large holders missed the vote and a separate Signal Request has been posted to revoke the above trial.
