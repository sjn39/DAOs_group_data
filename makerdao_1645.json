                    "content": " TL;DR: Now with some clarifications to reduce misinformation potential  Financial regulation trends towards a post-9/11 paradigm of \u201ceither you\u2019re with us or you\u2019re against us\u201d with eventual zero tolerance for anything that doesn\u2019t give full control and surveillance powers to the state The window of opportunity for DeFi to prove that it is worthy of a new middle ground of being considered a public, neutral financial utility rather than regulated as banks has now closed because DeFi failed to deliver anything of real value, and the massive crashes of Terra, Celsius etc ruined its mainstream image Physical crackdown against crypto can occur with no advance notice, and with no possibility of recovery even for legitimate, innocent users. This violates two core assumption that we used to understand RWA risk, making the authoritarian threat a lot more serious. Dai cannot become blacklistable, so Maker does not have the option of becoming compliant The only choice is then to be prepared to limit attack surface through RWA exposure reduction, by having the option of enforcing a maximum relative exposure to RWA - triggering this would likely cause Dai to free float away from USD, at stable, predictable rate that feels like negative interest rates  The Endgame Plan offers two effective tools to deal with this: MetaDAOs and Protocol Owned Vault MetaDAO token farming with Dai provides justification for why a free floating currency should exist and why users should accept something that falls in value vs USD MetaDAO tokens can also incentivize more supply of Dai generated from decentralized collateral, allowing the system to scale better while remaining decentralized Protocol Owned Vault (Maker accumulating a large amount of leveraged staked ETH) is another important tool as it allows Maker to earn income from negative Target Rate of Dai, and put a lower limit to how negative the Target Rate can go.  What\u2019s the timeline for this:    Endgame Plan timeline to free floating Dai Governance       In this post I will go over the the basic timeline of the Endgame Plan, including when and under what conditions it is possible that Dai could go free floating.  The most important takeaway is this:   Dai will remain 1:1 with USD for at least 3 years The timeline for free floating away from 1:1 with USD would be delayed if there is no immediate authoritarian threat The 1:1 peg with USD would remain indefinitely if the protocol can reach and maintain 75% decentralized collateral During the initia\u2026      Long form This post is to outline the argument of why limited RWA exposure and free floating Dai is necessary, and the tools we can use to turn it from a risk into an opportunity. Much of the information and opinion I\u2019 m sharing here comes from conversations I\u2019ve had with various well connected insiders following the TC sanctions, as well as knowledge that is publicly available and in some cases has been shared more privately over the past years.  The post 9/11 paradigm of financial regulation First lets briefly discuss what I\u2019ve heard many people refer to as the \u201cpost-9/11 paradigm\u201d. Basically this is a financial regulatory trend that, when taken to its extreme, divides all financial activity into two boxes: Either you\u2019re fully compliant, regulated bank, or you\u2019re a terrorist. Important to note that it\u2019s a trend, not a black and white reality, meaning obviously there\u2019s plenty of financial activity that isn\u2019t fully regulated as a bank with total government control - but over time the trend is one way and financial freedom will get eroded, never increased as long as this trend remains. Of course government control of finance is a historic trend that dates back literally the very first invention of paper currency in China (and how it eventually got controlled and hyperinflated), but 9/11 can be seen as the event that really created the modern momentum for this trend to reach a point where it is slowly but surely going to choke out all forms of financial freedom that it possibly can. The fact that the mainstream views finance as an extremely shady industry run by evil and greedy wall street bros of course helps, because from that (pretty much true) perspective its easy to see why it makes sense to maximally regulate them into the ground.  The window of opportunity The window of opportunity is an idea that me and many others held: The possibility that the immense potential benefits of blockchain technology and DeFi, when applied to the financial system through RWA integrations, could become the catalyst that finally changed the paradigm of financial regulation away from the post-9/11 paradigm and into a new post-blockchain paradigm. It\u2019s easy to see how the advantages of transparency, credible neutrality, efficiency, inclusion etc. helps solve the problems that makes finance and wall street bros seem so bad in the first place. Ideas like Clean Money and Financial Inclusion stemmed from this perspective, that if we played our cards right and used the last big crypto bull run to show real tangible benefits beyond what people would be expecting that truly showcase the massive positive potential of blockchain to the mainstream, such as mass financing of large scale renewable energy infrastructure that effectively did the governments job for it, or large scale access to cheap and efficient financial services for developing countries, etc. At a certain point, if enough of things are done, and are combined with an aligned and effective media and PR campaign and united vision from our industry, the thinking is that it could be enough to finally show that there is a limit to when it makes sense to keep cracking down, increasing control and increasing bureaucy for financial activity because the upside in terms of public goods from permissionless financial innovation is impossible to ignore, and can overpower the politics of the old paradigm and introduce a new, third category that sits between fully regulated and fully decentralized: A Financial Public Good - blockchain enabled, neutral financial infrastructure that isn\u2019t treated like a bank, but is treated like roads or Linux. Even if North Korea uses roads or Linux, we\u2019re obviously not going to ban that because of the significant value it provides to all of society. But unfortunately, as you can probably imagine, this window of opportunity has now closed for good. First of all, the blockchain industry completely and utterly failed to produce anything of value during the bull run. Basically nothing was achieved and no new products, services or anything with tangible benefit derived from blockchain technology has entered the mainstream consciousness at any level. Maker is a good example where we had a lot of initial support for Clean Money and a theoretical agreement with the concept - our intentions were in the right place. But nobody cares about intentions, and we were incapable of actually acting on that desire and turning words into action because, as it turns out, operating DAOs and doing useful working in decentralized paradigms is extremely hard. Secondly and much worse than just the fact that crypto has still failed to show any kind of value to society are the human tragedies that the failures of the last crypto cycle produced that have now become synonymous with blockchain and crypto in the public consciousness. Essentially the moment Terra collapsed is really the moment we should have realized that there is simply no possibility that we will be able to persuade the public that crypto should be treated differently from other financial services. So not only has crypto produced nothing useful, but the mainstream awareness of crypto centers around disasters like Terra, Celsius and other crypto scams that have destroyed the savings of innocent, regular people that were lied to and in some cases even committed suicide as result. We unfortunately managed to create the mainstream image of the crypto bro as the one type of person that\u2019s even worse than the wall street banker bro. In hindsight, it is maybe also have been slightly naive to believe in the window of opportunity when you deconstruct it to what it really is: Thinking that we would stand a chance of re-engineering a meta as strong as 9/11\u2026 But no matter what, whether or not it was ever even possible, it is now over for good and we need to readjust our world views to get in line with reality.  The two core assumptions of RWA risk The TC sanctions should not be seen as a direct consequence of any of these factors - rather it is most likely a random even that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with crypto directly, but rather was simply a quick and short term oriented attempt to produce a political win through some announcements and press releases. But it is a wakeup call to the consequences of not picking one of the two paths. Do you want to be treated as a bank, or do you want to be treated as something else than a bank and do you understand the full risk and consequences of that? The risk of RWA was always considered justifiable, despite the fact that DAOs have no real legal presence or entity or ability to enforce legal rights (even if governments erroneously think so), because of two important factors. The first factor was that any attempt to seize RWA or crack down on crypto\u2019s weak points, such as blacklists or collateral freezes, would be telegraphed in advance in order to allow innocent and legitimate users time to respond. The thinking was that governments wouldn\u2019t just nuke Maker and cause widespread harm to innocent people, they would simply ban Maker from relying on their legal systems if we don\u2019t follow their regulatory regimes. That turned out to be wrong as in the TC sanctions case, it was kept secret right up until the trap was sprung, and innocent users (luckily a small amount) had their USDC frozen in the tornado cash smart contracts. The second factor was the thinking that even if a freeze or seizure of RWA collateral happened, innocent users would have some path to recover their money, such as in the case of the e-gold Value Access Plan (VAP) E-gold - Wikipedia . Unfortunately, that turns out not to be a given as seen with the TC sanctions, where right now it looks those affected by USDC blacklist may have effectively lost their money, and the ETH designated as risky may not have an easy path to legalize their assets, even if they are completely innocent and used TC for financial privacy completely legitimately. This means the consequences of not being compliant and not becoming a bank are extremely severe. They\u2019re not something you can just gamble with, especially not when it pertains to peoples savings.  Why Dai has no choice but to prepare to free float So that leaves us with the two fundamental options: The path of compliance and eventually, on a long enough timeline, turning Maker into some kind of next-gen fintech product/neobank. Or the path of decentralization which means strictly limiting the degree to which regulatory crackdowns can damage the protocol. But, there\u2019s one important caveat: The path of compliance isn\u2019t even available to us. Why? Dai was engineered that way, as the developers who created it had the foresight to build it in such a way that it could never possibly become a tool of financial surveillance and control, by completely locking out the possibility that a blacklist can be added or that it can be upgraded. Despite all our governance bureaucracy and troubles, Dai is actually a truly decentralized stablecoin in this sense. There exists certain publicly discoverable facts, that when combined together with the fact that Dai cannot ever be blacklistable no matter how much Maker Governance would want to, makes it clear that there is a ticking clock counting down above our heads, and at some point in the future there is a high probability that Maker will be hit by a severe attack by global authorities targeting any attack surface they can find, through a process similar to what led to the TC sanctions. One thing to clarify is that this is still very likely many years out - or at least we have to assume that\u2019s the case because we simply do not have any realistic short term options that would enable to us to survive it. I\u2019m also not claiming it is guaranteed, nothing ever is. No one can possibly predict something as complicated as this but if I had to I would \u201conly\u201d give it a 50/50 chance to happen at some point over the next decade. But if you know that there\u2019s a 50% chance an airplane is going to crash, you are not going to board that airplane. I\u2019m obviously not going to spell out the facts I\u2019m referring to above, but it\u2019s fairly simple to put two and two together in light of recent events. I would encourage others to also not discuss it in public, there\u2019s no reason to create that kind of unwanted and dangerous attention early on, even if its not yet likely to be a big risk. As a result, we must choose the path of decentralization, as was always the intent and the purpose of Dai. And just like this was the original design of Dai, choosing the path of decentralization means preparing for the likely possibility that Dai will have to become free floating. The reason for this is simple: the path of decentralization means limiting our attack surface to physical threats, and specifically our RWA collateral as a percentage of the total portfolio. In the Endgame Plan I put this limit at 25% (before insurance and defensive measures are applied) during Eagle Stance, which is the strategy the protocol would employ while it is still not clear if there will actually be a crackdown or not. The only way to guarantee a hard limit on RWA exposure is to allow Dai to free float, as excess demand for Dai may not be able to be met with additional supply backed by fully decentralized assets such as ETH. The only way to then deal with this imbalance and prevent the peg from breaking - which can break the entire system if the faith is lost that Maker Governance will take action to protect the peg - is to introduce a negative Target Rate, that would cause the price of Dai to free float away from 1 USD to a lower exchange rate, driving away Dai demand and increasing Dai supply as it becomes cheaper to generate with decentralized vaults such as ETH. This can be a very hard reality to accept, but there is unfortunately no way around it. Dunning-Kruger attempts to guarantee a peg to 1 USD without having access to USD linked RWA collateral only ends in even worse misery and disaster, such as the Terra collapse. So our only choice is to prepare and do everything we possibly can to make it a transition that Maker can survive, and if we really play our cards right, it may end up becoming the opportunity Maker was waiting for all along.  2 powerful tools that can make free floating Dai a success The main challenge with decentralization and free floating Dai is that nobody cares about it until its too late. And I mean LITERALLY nobody, even the people LARPing and running their mouth about decentralization aren\u2019t using Rai. So the downside of decentralization, which is that it can lose value relative to the dollar, is extremely obvious and in your face, and most of the upside is completely hidden and cannot be understood by the human brain because of our inability to perceive long term and tail risk. The Endgame Plan provides two very strong tools that can overcome this challenge and turn the free floating of Dai into something that Maker can survive, and even thrive with. The Endgame Plan was already designed around the idea of physical resilience and decentralized from the beginning, it was just treated as a more theoretical and abstract threat, so all that was really needed to change was to prioritize and accelerate the implementations of these measures.  MetaDAOs and MetaDAO tokens The most important tool available are MetaDAOs. What\u2019s the only way to get someone to accept a free floating price and decreasing rate that makes them lose value in dollar terms over time? You have to give them something else in return. As it turns out, while decentralization has almost only downsides, there is one tangible upside that people actually care about. And it is not just any upside, it is the single most powerful thing that brought most people into the crypto space in the first place: The ability to create tokens. As also described in the Endgame Plan post, the creation of blockchain tokens is by far the most powerful form of meta engineering, and it is in fact so powerful that even governments recognize this power and try very hard to shut it down and control it. With a decentralized currency, the creation of a decentralized economy run by decentralized businesses governed by tokens becomes possible, and it cannot be shut down or controlled by authorities regardless of how much they\u2019d like to - as long as you have a real, actually decentralized currency underpinning it. And you can provide this benefit to Dai holders right \u201cin their face\u201d by yield farming them MetaDAO tokens of projects that have real, profitable, sustainable and fully decentralized business models - but again that\u2019s only possible because of the existence of a fully decentralized currency, which closes the loop and justifies the fact that Dai is free floating. Beyond justifying the existence of Dai even if it is free floating, MetaDAO token yield farming can also be used to incentivize generation of decentralized Dai from fully decentralized collateral such as Staked ETH (Or, for maximum value preservation, EtherDai), which helps grow the supply of Dai and reduce the negative rates Dai holders have to accept.  Protocol Owned Vault The other major tool is the Protocol Owned Vault - the strategy of having Maker itself accumulate large amounts of leveraged, Staked ETH and that way become a net issuer of fully decentralized, overcollateralized Dai. This has two big advantages: First of all it allows Maker to take advantage of the negative rates created from natural Dai demand, that will actually get exacerbated by the existence of MetaDAO yield farming (which nevertheless has to exist because it provides the fundamental core justification for why Dai even makes any sense at all if it\u2019s not pegged to the dollar). It should be easy to see how it can be very lucrative to both have a significant leveraged exposure to an asset that earns a yield of 5+% per year, and then on top of that have large amounts of debt that itself could yield e.g. 5% per year due the negative rates making it automatically go down over time in dollar terms. Secondly and much more importantly, having a protocol owned vault allows Maker to more directly control and impact how negative the rates are allowed to get, helping stabilize the free floating Dai and protect users against the uncertainty of randomly getting hit by extremely negative rate because of some demand or supply shock. Basically, if the rates get low enough Maker can step and in allow the Protocol Owned Vault to take on very high leverage in order to first of all stabilize the rates so they don\u2019t go any lower, but then also just harvest the massive potential for yield that debt with very negative rates have.  Cypherpunk meta A last major benefit of decentralized and free floating Dai is that it allows Maker to finally return to its true roots. Not just the roots of Maker and Dai, but of crypto itself, which ultimately comes from the Cypherpunk movement all the way back from the early 90\u2019s when governments first tried to ban encryption and enforce a hellish dystopian future where the concept of any kind of personal privacy itself becomes illegal (much like financial privacy has already become). It\u2019s hard to overstate how many of Maker\u2019s cultural, community and governance problems ultimately stems from the perceived deviation of this original ethos, and the contradiction that many of the necessary actions taken over time, such as the regulatory strategy of the Maker Foundation (which required very tight information control), or the introduction of unlimited USDC in order to enforce the USD peg at all costs. In the end I don\u2019t believe those choices were wrong at the time, as it allowed us to get to where we are today and have real network effects, momentum and success. But we should not underestimate the cost it had on the community and the soul of the project - and now we have the chance to get all of that back again. I think this is actually the factor that may end up being the biggest wildcard of all. If we can recapture that original spirit and once again prove to be the vanguard of the entire crypto spirit as we once where when we pioneered actually functional on-chain stablecoins and created DeFi, it will create a completely new level of attention and positive meta around the Maker ecosystem as a whole, which will result in an influx of users, community members, contributors - but also increase spark in Maker Governance, reducing bureaucracy, stalling and extractive intentions. Maker will not just become exciting once again, it will be the single most exciting and important place to be in all of crypto - and we have the perfect tool that allow us to capture that meta and hook people into our ecosystem: MetaDAO yield farming.  Collapse meta Another last point that is important to discuss is how this all fits into the broader, global meta caused by the state of irreversible, accelerating decline that exists in modern globalized society. There are multiple factors, including overshoot, overpopulation, climate change, peak oil, peak farmland, peak fertilizer, post-truth social media etc. It is likely that modern global capitalism cannot overcome these problems of its making, and the most immediate consequence is that politics will become increasingly polarized and unhinged. The world is going to enter a new, much more chaotic and unpredictable equilibrium dominated by anarchy, ecofascism, deglobalization and large scale human suffering. This matters for Maker and Dai for two reasons. The first reason is that broken states and limping zombie economies, or states obsessed with capital controls and general authoritarianism, tend to be more likely to crack down on crypto. It\u2019s easy to see the trend if you look at the list of countries that have already banned crypto: Bitcoin ban: These are the countries where crypto is restricted or illegal | Euronews This means that as the global economy and socioeconomic stability increasingly falls apart across most places in the world, the likelihood of a physical attack by state actors against Maker goes up. As this trend is accelerating and irreversible, this by itself adds another strong argument on the pile of why Maker has to prepare to go fully decentralized and expect the worst against it\u2019s RWA collateral, requiring it to become free floating. The second reason is that such a chaotic and dystopian future is exactly the reason why Dai and crypto as a whole exists. People will need tools to navigate the future when government and the elite can no longer be trusted to even keep themselves from collapsing, let alone keep the best interests of the people in mind. The most important and powerful tool in such a situation is going to be collapse-resilient, decentralized money. As all other currencies pour fuel on the fire of the global financial ponzi scheme that is already deeply in overshoot, we can prepare for the worst and focus on accumulating resilient collateral such as ETH, or even eventually physically resilient RWA (as described in the Endgame Plan post) and build something that could end up meaning the difference life and death for millions.

If this is true, I disagree that free floating DAI will be of much help. Why would an authoritarian government disallow fiat pegged stable assets, but permit free floating stable assets (or even volatile base crypto assets for that matter) when they still undermine government control over the monetary system? Sure, removing directly censorable collateral (which effectively requires free floating peg) could help improve resilience. But there are many other points of failure that are essentially irreducible at least in the medium term - oracles, on-off ramps, consensus nodes of underlying chain, some amount of workforce and/or voter participation, etc. I think this window of opportunity is definitely getting smaller, but is not a foregone conclusion. What are some reasons that Maker / DAI ecosystem, and wider crypto space still have reason for optimism?  China is giving the world a preview of CBDC; this is good in a way, because it shows the rest of the world the predictable outcome of directly state controlled money (statist surveillance dystopia) Recent Canada trucker incident of debanking political opponents / protesters was a big wake up call, particularly because Trudeau had been viewed as a very liberal figure; this episode undermined the argument that government financial control is only problematic in authoritarian states, not democracies CBDC are unlikely to be adopted/mandated in the US and other pro-market states regardless, because it conflicts with vested interests in the financial sector and would remove free market forces from credit creation US govt needs new sources of reserve demand, and global retail usage of USD instruments (stablecoins) is by far the most viable option with the least negative impact to the domestic economy (compare with requiring banks to hold greater amount of treasuries or central bank reserves, which would starve the private sector of credit) The economic benefits of faster/real-time electronic payments are huge, but they can only be really achieved using instruments with settlement assurance (otherwise the payments are not real time, because the recipient needs to wait to avoid chargebacks, exactly like current T+2 systems) Real time payments cannot be safely implemented with centralized assets; consider what would happen if Circle had their admin keys compromised and used to mint unlimited USDC without authorization; only decentralized assets can provide provable security  So what exactly should we be doing? I think making preparations to free float DAI is sensible, but we shouldn\u2019t try to convince ourselves this solves the problem. I think a more balanced approach of reducing liquidity risk from centralized assets (eg LP token backing displacing PSMs), strong public engagement and advocacy for decentralized money, and willingness to sacrifice short term profit/burn/number-go-up to try to win greater ETH market share and decentralized collateral backing will be more effective. Introducing metaDAOs is not a cure all. DAO to DAO relationships imo are more complicated and difficult to manage than service provider - client relationships, not less. This is particularly true due to possibility of overlapping ownership of MKR and metaDAO tokens. Being able to issue tokens is powerful, but only works in the long term if the underlying protocol makes sense as a spin off, and has sufficient autonomy from Maker to be able to deliver value to metaDAO token holders. We can\u2019t depend on retail investors lighting their money on fire buying valueless governance tokens indefinitely. Protocol owned vault is also compelling idea, but we should look at FEI\u2019s experience. tldr is that DAOs are not well suited to directional trading activity. ",

                    "content": "I agree with basically all of these points, but I also think they support the plan as it\u2019s currently designed. Will go through each important point to discuss:  If this is true, I disagree that free floating DAI will be of much help. Why would an authoritarian government disallow fiat pegged stable assets, but permit free floating stable assets (or even volatile base crypto assets for that matter) when they still undermine government control over the monetary system?  Fully agree with this. I do think pegged assets will be hit harder and earlier, but that still doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t expect to get hit in all cases, so the reason for free floating is to enable us to have negative rates to reduce demand and increase supply from decentralized collateral.  Sure, removing directly censorable collateral (which effectively requires free floating peg) could help improve resilience. But there are many other points of failure that are essentially irreducible at least in the medium term - oracles, on-off ramps, consensus nodes of underlying chain, some amount of workforce and/or voter participation, etc.  Exactly, we have to go all the way with physical resilience and decentralization. There is no middle ground and that means solving all of these problems. Oracles are actually somewhat easier to decentralize since we can use elixir and meta elixir to provide accurate prices for eth, mkr and metadao tokens in dai - and well curated on-chain sources controlled and collateralized by the MetaDAOs for dai price in usd. The MetaDAOs can also take responsibility and collateralize the operation of actual physical oracle nodes, as well as staking nodes when we develop that in the longer term On/off ramps is just a matter of going through ETH, and in general we should only rely on the existance of an already on-chain economy. Having friendly jurisdictions that allow open use and conversion of dai is of course a big plus. Security of the underlying chain is difficult, but the best we can do is to influence lido and eventually have the metadaos build out their own secure node networks. And for the workforce\u2026 at this point there is no way around it - it will have be fully anonymous. It\u2019s a hard problem but from the maker perspective it is actually not even an issue because maker already doesn\u2019t have to interact with people, just with metadaos. So the metadaos will have to figure out the challenge of bootstrapping decentralized reputation, as well as develop extremely strong frameworks that means someone sybil attacking would literally have to do the work of 2 people, which then isn\u2019t really a problem. None of these things can realistically be in place in the short run, but I think it can be achieved within 3 years, or at least be close to done.  I think this window of opportunity is definitely getting smaller, but is not a foregone conclusion. What are some reasons that Maker / DAI ecosystem, and wider crypto space still have reason for optimism?  I also agree that it\u2019s not guaranteed, but the probability is now high enough, and the consequences severe enough, that we have to act as if its certain. Basically the 10% chance of the plane crashing means you don\u2019t take the plane analogy. The Endgame Plan leaves open the possibility that if 3 years from now it turns out that everything is just absolutely peaceful and all of the trends stopped, then we could choose to delay the free floating further. But because we need to have the option to do it at year 3 without causing a meltdown, we have to prepare as if it is happening for certain. Personally I am more pessimistic than optimistic, but of course we need to look at the actual facts and circumstances at the time - the important thing is we prepare.  I think making preparations to free float DAI is sensible, but we shouldn\u2019t try to convince ourselves this solves the problem.  Well I disagree with this. If we really go fully decentralized, as in full phoenix stance with no attack surface including only decentralized/resilient collateral, anonymous workforce, decentralized oracles, decentralized downloadable frontends/toolkits, broad incentivized and active voter base with strong privacy tools (built into the decentralized frontends), then this does actually solve the problem. There is no way to kill or seriously wound such a system.  I think a more balanced approach of reducing liquidity risk from centralized assets (eg LP token backing displacing PSMs), strong public engagement and advocacy for decentralized money, and willingness to sacrifice short term profit/burn/number-go-up to try to win greater ETH market share and decentralized collateral backing will be more effective.  I completely agree with this and this is basically the idea for Pigeon Stance and Eagle Stance. We shouldn\u2019t give up on Clean Money and other attempts to showcase the value of DeFi and blockchain to society. But we also shouldn\u2019t sleepwalk like pigs to the slaughter, and make sure that we balance our exposure with the risk as it gets worse over time.  Introducing metaDAOs is not a cure all. DAO to DAO relationships imo are more complicated and difficult to manage than service provider - client relationships, not less. This is particularly true due to possibility of overlapping ownership of MKR and metaDAO tokens. Being able to issue tokens is powerful, but only works in the long term if the underlying protocol makes sense as a spin off, and has sufficient autonomy from Maker to be able to deliver value to metaDAO token holders. We can\u2019t depend on retail investors lighting their money on fire buying valueless governance tokens indefinitely.  Agree. Fundamentally the MetaDAOs are designed for positive sum activity, the core being attracting users to stake and leverage ETH with the Maker Protocol, and use Dai for savings and payments. So at their core MetaDAOs create value by developing good meta and using it to attract users for Maker, as basically gamified marketing and distribution teams. If they can then also develop other innovation and value add that\u2019s just additional free value that benefits everyone. One thing that makes the DAO2DAO relationships with MetaDAOs a lot simpler is the fact that they are always heavily collateralized, and maker can simply take the collateral from them if internal maker processes determine that they\u2019ve failed to deliver a commitment and the voters agree.  Protocol owned vault is also compelling idea, but we should look at FEI\u2019s experience. tldr is that DAOs are not well suited to directional trading activity.  Also agree, I think we need a simple strategy of using all income to go 2x leveraged long at a slow and steady pace, and then stop buying if ETH rises in a way that looks similar to past bubbles - unless the negative rates are too severe and the yield makes the risk worth it or it is critical for not destroying confidence in Dai.

                    "content": "I eco @monet-supply here, and I don\u2019t want to repeat several points that he has so eloquently made already.  On Relationship with Sovereign Regulators Is the current relationship between global regulators and large DeFi protocols sustainable? No, it isn\u2019t. I would not extrapolate the TC episode, which is punctual and probably even (don\u2019t kill me) motivated by good intentions - although with clumsy action, but the relationship between credit or pseudo-currency DeFi protocols is not set in stone yet. I personally dislike using catchy sentences that polarise opinions (9/11, terrorism, etc.) but this is my personal taste and I have never been a good politician. Is there a way to shield entirely from dealing with regulators? No, there is not. As long as we interact in the real world as humans, we have relationships with other sovereign banking actors, we will always have to deal with regulators of other economies. Sovereign countries have often control of their borders and financial system, yet they need to compromise with large economies because in the nature of things they are interrelated. Look at Switzerland and their relationships with the DoJ. Obviously if we want to illude ourselves we can, but it won\u2019t get us far. Is there a way to limit existential risk coming from regulators? Yes, there is. Limiting and selecting carefully the links with the real world is a start - including reducing our counterparty exposure to the USA and Circle, as @rune suggested, but definitely not a panacea. I\u2019d adventure myself in saying that a pro-active approach with regulators would lead us further than a ideological one, but we are in the realm of opinions. I have the belief that good faith and good practice can go a long way, like for example showing regulators that we have the right internal checks and balances to take creditworthiness decisions - currently it\u2019s just a jungle where corruption, as per Rune\u2019s own voice, should be incentivised because it\u2019s a good vector for improvement. I would also adventure myself in saying that a larger surplus buffer could be another good step towards improving relationships with the regulator. I have not been in the insiders\u2019 room here, but I have dealt with regulators (including and mainly the ECB and other European national supervision agencies) a lot in the past and I am afraid to say that most of their concerns have solid ground. If you disagree, I am asking if you have been around the financial system during the 2008-2012 era.  On Endgame and MetaDAOs I share the view that Maker core should be simplified, and I myself have been a strong proponent of DAO-to-DAO relationships \u00e0 la D3M. But as @monet-supply said DAO-to-DAO relationships are difficult. Ultimately, GIGO rules: if there is not the incentive for MetaDAOs to do a fine job by onboarding and monitoring good collateral, the destructive effect cannot be compensated by token farming, or by the hope that retail investors will just digest whatever we drop to them. Hint: farming tokens to raise money from retail investors are not a good way to improve relationships with the regulators. And here again, I agree with the regulator. On the peg, I see that there is a lot of discussion on how to absorb excess demand. Although the PSM has been a way better framework that the buy-and-burn-Luna model advocated by Terra, that made so many $LUNA holders reach, especially the ones who opted out on time, I agree with everyone that it is suboptimal, it is not accretive, and it is making $DAI a $USDC wrapper of negligible importance. Does it have to be improved? I think so. Downward pressure, however, is more difficult to manage. Maker is ultimately a thinly capitalised bank, with very limited surplus buffer, and expanding its complexity without a parallel increase of the cushion is dangerous to say the least. We have experienced the success of the over-collateralised model to manage token market risk, we should adopt the same to manage credit and operations risk as well. I also agree that preparing for a float of $DAI is wise. No currency has successfully expanded by maintaining a peg in infinity. I agree that a floating band is way more useful, and I am myself a fan of $RAI\u2019s automated open market operations. How we get there, however, it\u2019s a different conversation. Maker won\u2019t be here for a long time unless we grow up and:  Improve internal checks and balances Seek proactive conversations with regulators Improve drastically our governance model Minimise complexity Ensure a significant capital cushion  The alternative is RAI+, a permissionless lower-vol derivative product on $ETH. Great, useful, but nothing more than a permissionless financial product. ",

I completely agree with you, although the TC thing more than surprise, it was a future that was in voices, we remember that TC had been a money laundering niche for the pyramid scams of the P2E of 2021, in addition to other movements of schemes ponzis like Generaci\u00f3n Zoe from Argentina, knowing the multiple collapse that occurred in cryptocurrencies and that the government was not going to be able to have its % tax, probably found out the niche, they could even say that they did not attack Monero because it is almost impossible, the thing is that they did not it can be \u201cverifiable\u201d that innocent people have been used TC and casually blocked more than that they say \u201cI\u2019m innocent because I posted it on Twitter\u201d     rune:  The second factor was the thinking that even if a freeze or seizure of RWA collateral happened, innocent users would have some path to recover their money, such as in the case of the e-gold Value Access Plan (VAP) E-gold - Wikipedia   Since we knew that members of the cypherpunks were being hunted down one by one in the 90s, we had to understand that this would not be easy, but particularly if there is no real partnership between crypto and material, how could we enter the global market? biggest in the world?     rune:  As a result, we must choose the path of decentralization, as was always the intent and the purpose of Dai.   In order to achieve this we must first undo or lower the exposure of USDC, we cannot dictate \u201cwe are a decentralized entity\u201d when we are the largest holders of USDC, the mentality must change if we want full decentralization, make the contracts for RWA tiny, not look for large companies (even if something bad happens the impact is not so serious) and we cannot dictate decentralization when we are happy with associations like BlackRock, we must follow the legacy of privacy and freedom, or at least camouflage centralization with decentralization     rune:  we can recapture that original spirit and once again prove to be the vanguard of the entire crypto spirit as we once where when we pioneered actually functional on-chain stablecoins and created DeFi, it will create a completely new level of attention and positive meta around the Maker ecosystem as a whole, which will result in an influx of users, community members, contributors   Totally agree, but the adventures of End Game are very abrupt, difficult to understand for new users, if we want to be what it was before we need support, the decentralization mentality has to be totally real, and always meticulous with the plays and the cards that are used, because it is useless, to dictate and not follow the example, RWA and End Game can coexist RWA as you say, to a lesser extent, of course, but the greatest operation that will exist in cryptography is the union between the real world and crypto, we must find to be that bridge that a person will want to have without KYC and without any kind of danger. To conclude, the future is imminent, from Powell seriously thinking about applying CBDC to the European Union, the average user will have to get used to electronic money compulsorily, just as he got used to wearing a mask without putting up any opposition, when the population gets used to using CBDC and fully entering virtual money will make capital income much easier, they will have to know cryptocurrencies, and Maker and DAI will be there to receive them, more than 8 years ago the total capitalization did not exceed one billion, now they have that capacity Doge, so we should not despair because the opportunities are there, as our previous generation got used to debit/credit cards and points of sale and bank transfers, later our generation will get used to P2P transactions.

How is the latter option better?   Again, let\u2019s stay away from jargon-ing stuff. What does investment banking rail mean? I am not advocating for a rail, I am advocating for an asset. And that asset is cash. There is a strong reason very sophisticated regulators have been continuously pushed towards simplification in tiering capital reaching the point that if it\u2019s cash is good, if it\u2019s not cash, it should be heavily discounted because its correlation with other assets in moments of crisis is all TBC. I do not care how you put the cash in the Surplus Buffer, as long as we do. But others might care. I personally have a bias towards discussing merits of an investment with a pro rather than trying to meme a retail investor, but I might be too old.     flipflopflapdelegate:  MO, adding and capturing a large majority of outstanding stETH can improve the SB positively.

Agree with you entirely, but don\u2019t spill \u201cwith MetaDAOs\u201d as a necessary step, it is a tool that has been proposed, and just a tool. Personally, I am not against it, but I would like to see it tested in a very simple use case, debated, VOTED (bold, big letters), and deployed. And then continue with building up the complexity. Back where I started: Occam\u2019s razor. It is a fair assessment that a complex construct hides several attack vectors and existential risk angles. I would truly appreciate less writing and more engineering starting from a very simple building block. I have indeed read Endgame v3, but its complexity makes it impossible for a researcher like myself to offer a holistic view of its implications and risks. ",

The trend since 9/11 for increased surveillance and control is objectively true, but there is nothing but speculation in how this trends pertains to the future.  The very existence of cryptoassets and their persistent could serve as an indicator that this trend is already being tested in the other direction. I would argue that overreach of government enforcement is an aberration away from the norm, and it\u2019s just as likely to see a swing in the opposite direction, rather than an ultimate continuation upwards. Democratic countries are slow in the development of policy, and despite years of warnings from folks like Marx and Mao, they have been far more successful in supporting the normative principles of liberalism than not. Why should that fundamentally change in the 21st century? Information technology has been as much of an enabling factor for democratic trends as it has been an enabling factor for government authoritarianism. Francis Fukuyama went far enough to call liberal democracy the \u201cEnd of History\u201d, and that \u201cthe end-point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\u201d As bad as things get, to bet the massive civil societies of North America and Western Europe will abandon this trend is an extreme viewpoint. I think the Endgame plan does a lot to strike the right balance between my rather optimistic perspective here and the pessimistic one you paint, but I think in the end it still fails to provide the regulatory protection you are looking for. @luca and @monetsupply cover this pretty well, but I\u2019ll add emphasis to the benefit and need for a positive narrative and a proactive stance with regulated society. The meta of Dai and Maker around these two points has often been a much stronger tool in affecting outcomes here than not. And I don\u2019t think that window has closed, especially as the Tornado Cash sanctions are to be challenged in court and it\u2019s far from clear how larger global society will continue to react to the outcomes of the recent weaponization of the dollar. In the end, there\u2019s a lot in the endgame I agree with: the organizational restructuring of the MetaDAOs seem incredibly useful, balancing RWA allocation against the larger balance sheet is critical, the leveraged long on Eth seems like a good strategy for Maker, and developing inherent resilience makes a lot of sense (and is truly a hallmark of any digital, critical-services system). However, I find this perspective of regulation, politics, and society incredibly flawed. In the narrative you\u2019re describing here, you seem to paint a picture of the real-world as a place that isn\u2019t worth fighting for and that Dai shouldn\u2019t be fighting for. I think that this is abandoning the vision you\u2019ve previously painted for this project and is certainly giving up on the biggest tool Dai has had so far - a positive narrative of a more productive, more equitable, and more efficient finacial system.

                    "content": "It\u2019s so good to finally see this recognized by weighty MKR voting power. I\u2019ve been in the minority warning about this exact risk for years. It has seemed that it\u2019s been mostly the Americans that have been sympathetic to this viewpoint, I assume due to our proximity and experience with the primary state actor we\u2019re referring to. I would like to propose some concrete immediate steps to begin walking back from the cliff edge we\u2019ve found ourselves on, if that is possible.   First: gradually begin raising the tin on the PSM to immediately begin reducing USDC demand by the system. There is a non-linear demand curve that increases exponentially as the PSM fees approach zero. After reducing the tin to zero the system began rapidly taking on USDC to embarassing and self-destructive levels, as was predictable and predicted. In an ideal situation, the tin value could be lerped up to some percentage where the protocol itself is no longer the exchange of first resort, instead letting the market discover a value somewhere in between. The PSM should ultimately be removed from the system or left set at a value near the collateral liquidation penalty fee. Letting Dai float above peg is not critical to the system at all, and it encourages traditional collateral vault usage by allowing users to get more value for their Dai at market than it\u2019s nominal system value. We\u2019ve been neglecting vault holder needs for years and forgoing the sustainable growth and income that they provide.   Second: Decrease the collateralization ratio of all ETH-X ilk types. These are the premier cryptoassets in our ecosystem due to their innate value, market liquidity, and lack of regulatory attack surface. Lowering the collateralization ratio allows more Dai per vault to be issued by the system and helps increase supply sustainably. There are risks to the system in lowering this ratio, but our Liquidations 2.0 module has been working well for over a year and I\u2019m convinced that we can handle it. We also need to evaluate this risk in the context of the risks posed by USDC and RWA\u2019s. A lower collateralization ratio furthermore sets a hard cap on the price of Dai. If we assume no PSM and a collateralization ratio of 15% on ETH-A, at $1.15 Dai it becomes cost-effective for users to buy ETH, generate Dai to market sell the arb, and walk away from their vaults. The protocol can liquidate the collateral later and collect the penalty fee from the sale of the assets. This puts a guaranteed hard upward cap on the Dai price by directly incentivizing vault usage. It may be gauche to say it, but the protocol has actually profited most in the past year from market downturns due to the liquidation penalties than from standard stability fees anyways, so we should not be afraid to let these mechanisms work.   Medium-Long term: Aggressively work toward automating the core protocol with the goal of ultimately locking out governance actions from core components. I am speaking as an individual here, but as a member of the Protocol Engineering team I can tell you that my time since Black Thursday has been primarily focused on securing the \u201caggressive growth\u201d modules that have mostly resulted in destabilizing the system and which have created additional fires for the DAO and PE to put out. I\u2019ve developed an on-chain dss rate calculator that can be used for rate automation relative to debt ceiling usage, and which could ultimately result in a module that allows governance to set an implausibly high debt ceiling for an ETH vault, with rates automatically managed by the algorithm.  That would allow the system to continue operating in the event that governance is unable or unwilling to modify the system. The rate expansion and contraction function in that module is a bit of a trick that needs to be solved for, and unfortunately one we haven\u2019t had time to focus on.   I want to make it clear to everyone that the incentive mechanisms within Dai work as designed, as Rai has been proving, although they may not operate quickly enough for many in the community. It should be noted that Sai traded below peg for the entirety of it\u2019s lifecycle, and Dai traded below peg prior to Black Thursday. It is it\u2019s natural state. It was only after Black Thursday and due to the mechanical and incentivized Dai demand from Curve and Compound that Dai broke peg high. Even then, the price trended down for months prior to the imposition of the PSM and likely would have continued to do so if permitted, all while encouraging safe Dai generation from user vaults. Anyways, I\u2019m very glad that there\u2019s recognition that some form of ossification of the protocol is necessary in this environment, and that a soft peg is a worthwhile price to pay for warding off the existential risks of working with hostile jurisdictions. That\u2019s the project I invested in personally and professionally. I\u2019m here for this. ",

I co-founded Bidali - a reg compliant multi-chain crypto payments solution working on enabling cryptocurrency for more p2p real world commerce. Been in crypto since 2015 because of its potential to enable p2p open commerce, improve financial access & autonomy, and lift people out of poverty. I have seen first hand how corruption and inadequate financial access can cause harm. I\u2019ve also seen and assisted with financial crime investigations. I believe cryptocurrency can be a better alternative than our current solution and FinTech trends, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with how cryptocurrency becomes real money. This is what initially attracted me to DAI in 2017. I was around before and during the DAI Black Thursday that ultimately led to the USDC collateral decision (which I voted against). I co-chair the Canadian Blockchain Consortium and since speaking in Davos in 2020, I often speak with many politicians, central bankers and regulators as part of my CEOing and advocacy work. (Hey @rune . Long time since we chatted over beers in my buddy\u2019s Davos brewery)   As someone who\u2019s been involved with regulators and governments in many jurisdictions with regards to crypto assets, DeFi, etc. I completely agree with Luca, @monet-supply, and Asad\u2019s comments. I wanted to share some of my thoughts I\u2019ve had bottled for some time.  How Does a Cryptocurrency Become Money?  A path to any cryptocurrency becoming used as money is only viable if you can use it to efficiently and cost effectively pay for goods, services and scarce resources across space and time.  The currency that satisfies this will emerge as the winner, resulting in the broadest use, and consequently, the most demand among users. This is the crux of achieving \u201cdecentralized money\u201d. The most important factor in achieving sufficient decentralization is the distribution of the money and the non-correlated demand and usage of it, not the issuance mechanism or the protocol itself. Of course, how centralized the issuance and the ability to censor transactions at the protocol level is also important, especially in the digital era, but if a protocol on a decentralized network is immutable, it matters not whether one person created and thew away the key or thousands. What matters more to the stability and demand of a strong currency is the broad distributed demand and usage of it. If we look at USD for example, it is widely held and widely used for global trade. This prevents any one party from accumulating enough that they can cause a run because there is large demand. Furthermore, there is a requirement to pay taxes in it (which also drives demand). While USD is minted from the Fed it is actually very censorship resistant, especially in cash form. This has everything to do with its distributed and uncorrelated usage. It\u2019s why someone can use it to buy groceries in the US via credit card, someone can forge USD bills in Peru and use them as currency, and why, even though USD is illegal in Venezuela and there are political sanctions, it is now the dominant currency there. I see this broad currency demand as very difficult to achieve for cryptocurrency (or any digital form of money) without complying with regulation today because, as we\u2019ve seen with TC, even if the underlying technology renders censorship impossible at the protocol level, because the money can be tainted near instant (as opposed to cash), the societal risks of interacting with a tainted currency breaks the social consensus required for it to satisfy it\u2019s ability to be good money. Money are just IOUs that represent credit or hard assets after all\u2026 Sure, some people in some parts of the world, may be comfortable with this taint risk. For some this will be because they are anon, are in a favourable country, or they are already undertaking criminal activity where their counterparties don\u2019t care about the taints either. But to ultimately reach a large enough mainstream adoption such that a currency would be sufficiently decentralized and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d would be impossible if there is significant risk of confiscation or persecution with a tainted currency. Ultimately, regardless of the technology used to make it more efficient and secure, money is a social consensus tool. If users are worried about it retaining its value or its ability to be used to pay for goods and services, the consensus surrounding its value will erode.  Why Hasn\u2019t This Worked So Far? The lack of \u201creal world\u201d demand and utility is something that every cryptocurrency so far has failed to solve and has seemed to neglect. Largely they are not used to pay for real goods and services because they haven\u2019t garnered enough trust and utility, especially compared to the status quo. For large scale usage, this includes regulatory compliance. Today, at some point in the payment chain there is friction that prevents a stablecoin from being used to pay for real world goods and services better than the status quo because they need to be converted back to traditional financial infrastructure (which already has compliance challenges). Until you can pay for your food, rent, utilities and taxes with DAI, this will prevent people from accepting it for payment in a large scale. This could happen by using an intermediary (which is what we do at Bidali) but I would argue you need to be able to directly pay for all these things without using an intermediary to really realize the benefits and become properly decentralized. To pay taxes would most definitely require regulatory compliant and government buy-in, where they themselves could be but one user in a decentralized system. Not every government truly controls their own currency, nor do they necessarily want to. In any case, presently converting from DAI to a better medium of exchange to pay for these things happens through a centralized entity that is even more likely to be a target for regulatory compliance. As a result, that on/off ramp has to charge more fees to offset this cost. This whole process introduces more intermediaries, not less. Which in turn creates more counterparty risk and cost, which then prices out the stablecoin as an economical competitor to fiat currency in most situations. It\u2019s even worse if ETH is used as a proxy because then there are multiple hops. This negative feedback loop is the reason that stablecoins have primarily been confined to the speculation fuelled crypto-economy where the \u201cgrowth\u201d has largely resulted from inflationary rewards or ponzi-esque structures. At present this is a zero/negative sum game and isn\u2019t sustainable for a decentralized money, because there isn\u2019t any real productive economic growth. If you can\u2019t pay for tangible goods and services with crypto better than the status quo, then you certainly aren\u2019t going to take on debt risk in those assets to try and produce real economic growth by taking on entrepreneurial endeavours (ie. expanding a farm or a business). This is why much of the borrowing activity in DeFi has been for speculation or arbitrage and not sustainable economic growth activities, and why underpinning stablecoins with volatile speculative assets has posed such a problem for maintaining a confident price peg against fiat currencies that are (in theory) backed by real economic activity. In reality, you\u2019re also exposed to regulatory compliance worries regardless. You either internalize it at the core protocol or push it to the edges (ie. on/off ramps). But by pushing it to the edges you practically guarantee that it won\u2019t reach large scale adoption because it\u2019s not as economical and efficient as the status quo, because more intermediaries introduced. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.  How could it work? Today, USDT and USDC are the most used to pay for real goods and services (mainly on Tron). This is because in some markets they can compete with the status quo (largely in markets that lack USD liquidity/access). The reason it\u2019s USDC and USDT instead of DAI, RAI, EURC, a CAD dollar or the Yuan is because:  They are the most liquid and accessible, especially at on/off ramps and fast low-cost networks; Compared to other crypto-assets they are the most regulatory compliant which enables more trust and on/off ramps; They are familiar and piggy back off the insane demand for USD as the currency for global trade; and They have perceived low peg and redemption risk for the most trusted fiat currency (especially USDC)  For USDC in particular its rapid growth has been precisely because it is USD pegged and more regulatory compliant. Now, this may change with regulations, and I\u2019m not saying USDC and USDT on Tron are the pinnacle of what should be aimed for but it\u2019s worth noting that both have seen rapid growth vs. other stablecoins because of their ability to compete with the current status quo, especially in markets that lack adequate USD access through traditional rails. This makes sense given that USD is the most trusted and demanded fiat currency for global commerce (for now). All this to say that if we want DAI to become decentralized money then I think:  Decentralized money needs a fast, low-cost, and sufficiently decentralized ledger so that there is 100% uptime; Decentralized money needs decentralized and uncorrelated demand; and Such demand needs to be sufficient such that you\u2019re too big to fail and very unlikely to see a large enough liquidity collapse that would erode trust  There are concrete steps to ensure point 1 is addressed. Points 2 and 3 can only happen if you can pay for real goods and services with DAI in a way that is better than the status quo. And the only way to achieve that is if:  Payments are low cost and finality is < 5s; It\u2019s easy to access and use; The perceived value/purchasing power of DAI remains stable and trusted; and Holders of DAI are not likely to be tainted or restricted simply by holding it;  To me, continuing to be regulatory compliant, building up more real world asset reserves, weaning off of USDC (becoming a better alternative), and being available on fast low-cost networks is the path to achieving this.  As an aside, our company has been working in this direction and is on track for deploying a digital currency on a decentralized network that would be properly regulated and enable direct p2p, b2b, and government tax payments across an entire country in 2022/2023. It\u2019s a unique opportunity to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of a pseudo-CBDC under proper regulatory supervision because this country does not have a central bank, has a USD pegged currency and has crypto-favourable leadership and regulators. This could be a viable path to having DAI being used to power an entire country, which could be a way to demonstrate to other nations that open source technologies are better at balancing financial crime and financial access. Not trying to shill. Simply sharing some context. Happy to discuss more if there\u2019s interest in going this direction.    Final Thoughts Given that today, USD is the most trusted and in demand currency, I fear that a deviation from a USD peg and lack of regulatory compliance will prevent DAI from being used as money in the real world because it will never be able to gain sufficiently large enough trust and demand. Without adequate cost-effective bridges to the \u201creal world\u201d or the ability to pay for things with DAI, DAI as a decentralized money alternative will be destined to fail and will more closely resemble a closed loop crypto casino chip. My personal view is that it would be better to be regulatory compliant, gain sufficiently decentralized demand and usage for real world economic activity, and then look to cut ties from a USD peg. By de-pegging and free floating now, I think there is a much harder hill to climb towards decentralized usage because it kills any large scale real world demand. I think fighting regulation is a losing battle. Nearly every country will eventually fall in line with OFAC and FATF guidelines so long as the US dollar is still the dominant global trade currency. On a macro scale we\u2019re seeing a shift in geo politics and the recent discussion between China, Russia and Saudi Arabia to contemplate energy trading in alternative currencies to the USD could thrust in a bifurcation in global trade. Maybe this changes OFACs reach, but even still, that will likely take years to play out. After speaking with banks and leaders in many countries (especially non-G20) many are very interested in the potential for stablecoins to alter the current correspondent banking relationships and reduce the friction and accessibility gaps that exist in our current global financial systems. The fact that most global transactions clear through the US fed is a huge reason the US still exerts financial control over the world.  When you meet with them, you realize that politicians are still people. They value a lot of the same things - privacy, financial autonomy, freedom, helping people and preventing human harm. Many want to be able to make decisions over their country\u2019s sovereignty and trade partnerships without the risk of losing their financial access just the same as individuals want to be able to do with their money as they please. This is not just a mentality reserved for cypherpunks. Cryptocurrency can enable a shift in these power structures and the emerging currency war between the Yuan and the USD, could provide a unique opportunity for a stable, non-sovereign currency to emerge as a preferred alternative among trade parters (probably more akin to an SDR like structure). But the only way that a cryptocurrency would even be considered is if it can be used as good money for payments in real world economies. If you look at history and how currencies gained dominance, they started by powering local real world economies where there were unique and demanded goods or services (generally highly demanded commodities like food, energy, metals, technology, etc). From there, the country with the most dominant production of those high demand goods or services would require others to adopt its currency for trade. After pricing core commodities, this typically trickled down over time to other secondary goods and services. This is how the USD became the global reserve. This is what many Bitcoin maximalists hope for BTC. That it will be a global reserve currency. But its fixed supply curve prevents BTC from being used as currency in a meaningful way due to the inherent volatility resulting from an inelastic supply curve. It\u2019s just too blunt an economic instrument. Something more elastic that is pegged to a collateral basket of real world assets/economic activity has a much better chance of success. Having DAI peg to a CPI or commodity index would be more along these lines and the RWA integration work that was being done here seemed to be an important stepping stone towards this. While I was initially against the USDC inclusion years ago for the very real risks that have been described ad nauseam, I think the path towards RWA integration put DAI on a better track to becoming a decentralized money and cutting this effort short would be a mistake if that\u2019s the goal. So I think the most important question to answer first is\u2026 What does DAI want to be? Should it be globally used money that is accessible and used by everyone? or Should it be what would likely become a niche cryptocurrency that a subset of people are willing to forgo convenience and/or cost savings because they find value in it\u2019s censorship resistance? Either way I\u2019m 100% in agreement with @rune that I don\u2019t think you can have both. ",

Two Competing Visions for Dai There are two visions for Dai present in this thread:   The protocol intermediates illiquid generalized on-chain capital in return for a stable priced asset. The asset price is tightly coupled to the global reserve currency to support broader usage and facilitate efficient foreign exchange decisions. The cost of supporting a broad scope of collateral and a tight exchange peg is seen in the necessity for a large degree of protocol controlled liquid USD-denominated revenue (hence the exposure to regulatory risk). This version of Dai is a principle connection between on-chain capital markets and the global money market.   The protocol intermediates illiquid decentralized on-chain capital in return for a stable priced asset. The asset price floats compared to other assets and its liquidity flows are tightly coupled with the decentralized economy. The cost of supporting liquidity to the decentralized ecosystem is seen in the necessity for a high-degree of stabilizing capital controls. This version of Dai is the primary money market for primarily decentralized capital markets.   These are overly simplified and laden with assumptions, but I think it articulates the overall visions succinctly enough to engender conversation.  On the Approach Today the protocol feels firmly in pursuit of the former vision and the Endgame is now expressing a desire to pivot towards the latter. The significant external touchpoints that have been developed (i.e. governance, oracles, centralized front-ends, off/on-ramps) directly pull against the ideals of the latter vision. Before we can even address the vision, the protocol needs to be able to overcome or mitigate the risk exposure from these areas. @brianmcmichael , as always, articulates well many of the system mechanisms that can be used here. For mitigating the rest, such as decentralized oracles:     rune:  None of these things can realistically be in place in the short run, but I think it can be achieved within 3 years, or at least be close to done.   This is absolutely critical in being able to address the above concerns effectively. I can actually better understand the sense of urgency and all or nothing approach by the Endgame now. But this is a big vision that outsources effectively all the work to MetaDAOs and relies on the value accrued to MetaDAO tokens to serve as effective incentives. This means we are relying on the ability to execute across decentralized counterparties, on ambitious and complex topics, and relying on the incentives of the proposed tokenomics.  On the Vision Beyond the approach to executing on this vision, there\u2019s a significant question about the vision itself. I can understand the desire to strictly adhere to the domain of the decentralized capital markets, as it minimizes the exposure to the politics of the real-world. But what is the upside? In simple terms: What is the potential for revenue-driven activity created solely by ETH, especially as it pertains to a stable-asset instrument? Without being able to facilitate payments in a larger economic context, Dai is limited to only the economic potential of the decentralized ecosystem - is this sufficient? If payment assets follow a power-law, why would Dai not lose ground to a more broadly usable instrument? This seems to me like the obvious outstanding issue with the proposed plan. Thankfully my Canadian brother @ekryski has articulated an alternative vision that captures my feelings on this subject well, so I co-sign his post as what I would like to see pursued as an alternative vision.

My personal view is that what is most valuable and best for humanity overall (and therefore for DAI), is playing the long game, and ultimately creating one unified currency for the world that is not driven by a single nation state. This is a decade+ journey and right now requires navigating regulatory compliance and geo politics while adoption is still in its infancy in order to create a network effect of such size that can be decentralized and economically resilient. The whole of crypto is not there yet because the majority of the activity is speculative as opposed to utilitarian. ",

On the other side, you take a possible higher regulatory risk to grow. Let\u2019s say you achieve $10B DAI with the decentralized solution and a 5% spread (revenues  - cost of funding , i.e. DSR/negative rate) You earn 0.5B per year which if you capitalized at 10% gives you a $5B MKR market cap. I don\u2019t take in account that the creation of MetaDAO will split the value creation between many entities and will dilute MKR claims on profit creation. If you stick to the current situation, the goal is to achieve $1T DAI circulating with probably more of 1-2% spread (as you need to provide actual safety and value to DAI holders). Let\u2019s say $10B annual earnings which gives a $100B market cap. Which means that the path of compliance is 20x more lucrative for MKR holders than the path of decentralization. Is the path of compliance 20x more risky? Probably on the regulatory side (mainly because no one will care of a small protocol anyway). But even that can be challenged by saying that if the 25% bucket of RWA is frozen by regulation, the project is dead anyway. You can change the assumptions as you want but at least it gives a basis for thinking about this decision. Even with a 2x increase in failure (the 50% airplane going to crash), the rational choice would be the compliance way as it would give still a 10x expected value. ",

This is already happening and is the case with SWIFT and other payment networks as well.    SWIFT - The global provider of secure financial messaging services    SWIFT and sanctions | SWIFT - The global provider of secure financial... Sanctions on countries : Statements by SWIFT and FAQ.       image1194\u00d7235 34.2 KB  Many Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are already having to comply with the Travel Rule which requires sender and beneficiary information for any digital asset transfer. DAI is no exception here. I think there is a stronger case to be made than with TC that controlling transaction signatures and verifying identity is the not the responsibility of DAI or Maker and is in the purview of the on/off ramps or wallet providers. From an AML/CTF perspective this seems to be consistent with the regulatory discussions I\u2019ve been in and enforcement guidance that came into force in Canada last year (first country to bring Travel Rule into force). I\u2019ll admit that I haven\u2019t engaged with the US heavily and they are a wildcard.  On the threat of sanctions of DAI vs TC I didn\u2019t want to comment on TC because I know more than what is public but I think it\u2019s important to share what I can. So here goes\u2026 TC was a bit of a special case because it was well known by many, including law enforcement (LE), that it was being used for financial crime and sanctions avoidance, and that this activity constituted the bulk of the usage. Anyone that says otherwise is wrong. There are still cases under investigation and while chain analysis companies work with LE they have an imperfect view and have an incentive to downplay criminal activity and highlight their effectiveness. It was also well understood by LE that there was no reasonable way to mitigate illicit transfers in TC because it is immutable, impossible to fully take down, and with the Nova release it was going to be impossible to trace outputs, preventing any traceability that could aide in preventing financial crime or freezing funds. LE is not inept like many crypto Twitter pundits like to paint them out to be. As a result, the only way to prevent additional crime from accelerating was to taint (sanction) all the smart contract addresses, any coins that touched them, and try and prevent further development on it. It was less of a concern before the Nova version rolled out because assets were still fairly traceable. What appears to not have been well understood was the ZkP mechanism for proving ownership of your funds. But this is all new and emerging tech and the ZkP solution isn\u2019t actually that helpful in this implementation. If assets cannot be flagged by on/off ramps or LE as high risk coming out the other side of TC, they don\u2019t even know which assets to freeze or which person or address to ask for a ZkP from. If you meet all 3 of the following criteria, you\u2019re bound to be shut down:  It\u2019s impossible to freeze assets to undertake an investigation; and  Transactions are untraceable; and  Large value transactions can happen rapidly without the ability to risk screen and/or undertake an investigation.  From experience dealing with LE directly in financial crime cases involving crypto, I can confirm that they are required to follow a proper due process to get a conviction (which is a lot of work) and they don\u2019t have the resources to follow up on things unless they are deemed important (they are pretty understaffed). This amount of worked is balanced with the severity of the potential negative outcomes (crime, human harm). The tipping point on TC here was the combination of all 3 of the above criteria being satisfied, in addition to the fact that it is immutable and there was a large amount of criminal proceeds proven to have flowed into TC. When enough financial activity is provably tied to any sanctioned entity or known criminal enterprise, especially when there is a good reason to believe it could cause human harm, it\u2019s going to be aggressively pursued and shut down. Especially if it enables significant anonymous transaction value that can\u2019t be frozen or paused in order to undergo a proper investigative process if criminal activity is known or suspected. This was 100% the case with TC Nova. While DAI satisfies criteria 1 and 3 above, DAI does not offer the same level of anonymity as TC nor has it seen the same level of criminal usage (yet). So I don\u2019t think they\u2019re in the same risk category particularly because on/off ramps can still risk score and freeze DAI on their custodial platforms. Is there a non-zero chance DAI will receive more scrutiny? Yes. But I do not think it has the same probability as TC, which was 100%. The shut down of TC did not come as a surprise to me and many others familiar with sanctions and financial crime compliance. Was only a matter of time and frankly, it took longer than I thought it would.  On moral obligations While I\u2019m an advocate for privacy and open access, I think we have a moral obligation to design systems that \u201cminimize harm\u201d and try to prevent bad actors from using it to harm others. \u201cBy whose rules?\u201d is a whole other discussion, but unequivocally this is something that the TC devs neglected. They knew how TC was being used to launder stolen crypto and they released Nova and made it even more censorship resistant anyway. This made it an even better solution for criminals, not worse. While I acknowledge the privacy argument and want to reaffirm that I think that freedom to develop open source software, freedom to financial access, privacy, legal due process, and public goods are all very important, I think sometimes we need to consider whether the negative effects of publishing open source software warrant it. The TC devs have my respect, but they should have taken a step back to ask whether they should release that implementation, and if there was a better way to balance privacy vs. enabling bad actors to have carte blanche. There is a part of me that wonders if we\u2019d have had as many DeFi hacks if TC didn\u2019t exist. I think by DAI going full anon and censorship resistant, without protocol level controls, we\u2019re running the risk of sweeping this moral obligation under the rug. In most cases, regulations are in place to prevent crime and human harm. Are they perfect? Far from it! I\u2019ve seen first hand the harm these restrictions have caused by preventing people from getting even basic financial access or by creating data honeypots where they\u2019ve had their identity stolen and life ruined. I\u2019ve experienced some of this myself. This is what got me intro crypto in the first place. But I\u2019ve also been around long enough to see the darkest side of crypto - how it\u2019s been used to traffic people and organs, to steal hundreds of millions from innocent people, to procure weapons and pay to commit murders. Any technology can be used for both good and evil no matter what you do. Humans are creative and while I believe most people are good, some just aren\u2019t. I think we have a moral obligation to discourage objectively bad behaviour.  A potential path forward All things considered, since 9/11 I think we\u2019ve swung too far towards an authoritarian structure and there is more harm done by our current KYC/AML practices and sanctions than the benefits we gain in catching financial crime. Most large scale criminal activity that LE is after still uses cash and has the power/money to circumvent sanctions even in the traditional financial system. As crypto becomes more private, censorship resistant and usable, this activity will migrate to cryptocurrency. TC is just the canary in the coal mine\u2026 In my opinion, the best way to balance preventing large scale crime and enabling better privacy and financial access, is to have private transactions but adaptable public risk scores on addresses that are applied by known trusted entities (such as LE, government, lawyers, banks, utilities, etc.). A combination of eligible transaction amount and frequency combinations could be programatically applied such that the financial activity that an address can undertake is gated based on the risk score of their address and the activity they are undertaking. This could be applied by core protocols or user facing applications. A critical piece to retain censorship resistance in a structure like this would be that a virgin address would have a risk score that still guarantees a reasonable level of transaction volume such that it enables \u201cfair rights financial access\u201d. This would likely have to align with the FATF Travel Rule des minimis exemption to get adoption today but could potentially be expanded over time. Combined with Sybil resistance and behaviour analysis techniques this could enable better access than we currently have while also doing a better job of reducing the aggregate movement of the proceeds of crime and making DAI an ineffective medium for such purposes. I\u2019ve been working on a paper that expands on these ideas if there is interest in collaborating. I think the unique properties of cryptocurrency - verifiability, immutability, privacy, and programmability - actually are the tools that can enable a better financial system if implemented right, and DAI might be the best positioned to pull it off. This of course would require a new version of DAI (or a new stablecoin under a different name).     rune:  I\u2019m not sure how I can be any clearer on this\u2026 It cannot be done, its not a matter of MKR holders voting for it or really really really wanting it and asking the developers really really really nicely. It is not physically possible, no matter what. The closest is to relaunch Dai with a blacklist and then ask users to migrate, but even then you can\u2019t force them. The only way to apply force to Dai users is to seize the collateral and make the token worthless - but it should be obvious that doing so would be suicide for the project and guaranteed to make it less relevant than even the most pessimistic prediction of a free floating stablecoin.   I don\u2019t think you realistically can, nor should you force an upgrade. The ecosystem is far too big and I agree a rug pull would be suicidal. Would likely introduce a whole pile of legal backlash as well. I think you could launch something new, outline the justification, and provide a path for convertibility. Might be pleasantly surprised how many people convert, especially if the current form of DAI does get sanctioned. I think your and @brianmcmichael\u2019s idea of reducing RWA exposure in the current version is still very much applicable. Since this would cause a de-peg, I suspect this would affect demand and may end up being an incentive for people to move to the new reg compliant DAI too. Probably would need to have the new contracts up before shuffling RWA over to collateralize the new version.  Will an upgrade like this kill DAI? No idea. Might not know until we try.  For me, I think upgrading to be regulatory compliant is the only viable path for DAI to get to large enough scale global adoption to become truly decentralized. As I\u2019ve been told dozens of times in life, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to kill your babies\u201d.   I don\u2019t say this flippantly. This is a brutal thing to bring up. There will most definitely be reduced demand from people that require more censorship resistance and that was the initial ethos that made DAI so exciting in the first place. But as things have matured I think we can all agree that we\u2019re realizing that decentralization is a spectrum and there are many things that impact where something lies on that spectrum. It\u2019s messy and complicated. Gauging interest on whether community members would like to see a regulatory compliant version of DAI might be a good governance vote topic. ",

It is not physically possible, no matter what.   You are probably correct on this statement. I do not have the technical knowledge or sophistication to know what can or cannot be done. And a peg to ETH would exclude ties to any fiat currency and thus represent the maximum in decentralization. As a counter argument, however, there may be a case where DAI tracks a path taken by the initial unregulated, ledger-based digital currency \u2013 the Eurodollar. The Eurodollar is largely unregulated and provides the backbone of global liquidity. Of course, national jurisdictions may regulate the institutions located within their borders. But this is regulation of the institution and not the Eurodollar. As an instrument, DAI serves a few important functions - (1) DAI allows crypto asset holders to transform the value of crypto assets into a liquid, stable, \u201cmoney-like\u201d instrument. (2) DAI will allow real world asset holders to transfer the value of real world assets into a liquid, stable, crypto-instrument. (3) DAI acts as a store of value mechanism for individuals in countries where dollars, when measured against the local currency, are a savings vehicle. I agree that decentralization is an important precept for DAI. But arguably, each of the three functions above may be equally valuable and the peg to the USD permits each of those functions to exist. What is more valuable for holders of MKR and DAI? It seems to me that if the broader MKR and DAI holder and user base felt that decentralization was of primary importance, then the answer is simple. However, if the broader MKR and DAI holder and user base is not demanding decentralization (particularly the DAI holders), then any de-peg, for the DAI holders, would be no different than the plain vanilla currency inconvertibility political risk so often feared by cross-border investors.       DAI being pegged to USD will always have its pros (most used currency in the world) and cons (most regulated currency in the world)   The \u201cmost regulated currency\u201d statement seems a bit broad. It may be the \u201cmost regulated\u201d because it is the most used and tradable currency.

If crypto enables tax evasion, money laundering or terrorist financing, the privacy/censorship rights will need to be weighted against the fair tax allocation and public safety rights.

And this approach will certainly limit the demand, use cases, scale and networks of a crypto currency.

By de-pegging and free floating now, I think there is a much harder hill to climb towards decentralized usage because it kills any large scale real world demand.

Thank you for the nuance, as well as pragmatism and blunt clarity that cuts through the noise of who and what is heroic (and not).     ekryski:  There is a part of me that wonders if we\u2019d have had as many DeFi hacks if TC didn\u2019t exist. I think by DAI going full anon and censorship resistant, without protocol level controls, we\u2019re running the risk of sweeping this morale obligation under the rug. In most cases, regulations are in place to prevent crime and human harm. Are they perfect? Far from it! I\u2019ve seen first hand the harm these restrictions have caused by preventing people from getting even basic financial access or by creating data honeypots where they\u2019ve had their identity stolen and life ruined. I\u2019ve experienced some of this myself. This is what got me intro crypto in the first place. But I\u2019ve also been around long enough to see the darkest side of crypto - how it\u2019s been used to traffic people and organs, to steal hundreds of millions from innocent people, to procure weapons and pay to commit murders. Any technology can be used for both good and evil no matter what you do. Humans are creative and while I believe most people are good, some just aren\u2019t. I think we have a morale obligation to discourage objectively bad behaviour.   I cannot improve upon what you have shared above. In particular, I want to say how great it is to see another person acknowledge a few points I have been screaming into the void (until now, I think - thank you)     ekryski:  Nearly every country will eventually fall in line with OFAC and FATF guidelines so long as the US dollar is still the dominant global trade currency. On a macro scale we\u2019re seeing a shift in geo politics and the recent discussion between China, Russia and Saudi Arabia to contemplate energy trading in alternative currencies to the USD could thrust in a bifurcation in global trade. Maybe this changes OFACs reach, but even still, that will likely take years to play out.   I would say, however, that this will be the case no matter what happens to the USD. The world is de-dollarizing and FATFA is designed for this eventuality. The one teeny tiny point I might add to the great conversation here is that \u201cdecentralization\u201d is not just about the technology and ability to upgrade the DAI contract. True decentralization - of course - also includes governance and control. Single points of failure exist when one person or a group colluding are de facto the rulers. It seems we have a resurgence of that here, which is the greater threat to a possible path to decentralization. So, everyone should also appreciate that regulatory threats include a determination about the legal classification of MKR token and DAI, and whether its governance and the system of delegation is DeFi theater. This reality puts certain individuals and organizations participating in leadership, management and determination of outcomes in various cross-hairs depending on the facts and circumstances, and whether authorities want to make a case. I don\u2019t know what the following means or whether what I have stated above is one of the things we shouldn\u2019t talk about, but in my 9 months as a Delegate and member of this community I have come to care about you as people and so try to speak out occasionally when I see someone leading you over a cliff.     rune:  There exists certain publicly discoverable facts, that when combined together with the fact that Dai cannot ever be blacklistable no matter how much Maker Governance would want to, makes it clear that there is a ticking clock counting down above our heads, and at some point in the future there is a high probability that Maker will be hit by a severe attack by global authorities targeting any attack surface they can find, through a process similar to what led to the TC sanctions. One thing to clarify is that this is still very likely many years out - or at least we have to assume that\u2019s the case because we simply do not have any realistic short term options that would enable to us to survive it. I\u2019m also not claiming it is guaranteed, nothing ever is. No one can possibly predict something as complicated as this but if I had to I would \u201conly\u201d give it a 50/50 chance to happen at some point over the next decade. But if you know that there\u2019s a 50% chance an airplane is going to crash, you are not going to board that airplane. I\u2019m obviously not going to spell out the facts I\u2019m referring to above, but it\u2019s fairly simple to put two and two together in light of recent events. I would encourage others to also not discuss it in public, there\u2019s no reason to create that kind of unwanted and dangerous attention early on, even if its not yet likely to be a big risk.   ",

They knew how TC was being used to launder stolen crypto and they released Nova and made it even more censorship resistant anyway. This made it an even better solution for criminals, not worse.  I can very clearly see how arguments like this will be made against V and eth 2 devs in court and in the public square. \u201cBy making it more censorship resistant, you made it better for criminals\u201d. Ethereum is designed to be censorship resistant for a reason. On the fringes, activists and freedom fighters look a lot like criminals.

We should be careful not to make such thoughtless statements ourselves. This is particularly relevant, in the context of justifying our own privilege to build alternatives to the USD, when the prevailing notion is that the USD is \u201cgood\u201d and that the USA is \u201cgood\u201d, and our engineering of alternatives is \u201cbad\u201d.

At some point it begs the question: is the USD even moral to uphold? Are we as US citizens prepared to bear the moral responsibility for the USD being one of the most devastating mechanisms for modern colonialism? Are there patriotic US citizens who are willing to put the moral responsibility to end the USD ponzi above their own purchasing power and self-interest?

I have zero disagreement here and this is an important part of the discussion.     ekryski:  \u201cBy whose rules?\u201d is a whole other discussion   I intentionally left out expanding on this in my OP due to length but you are 100% correct and your response covers many of the issues I had in mind when I posed that question. Like I mentioned above, I have a working thesis on how I think we end up at decentralized uncensorable money that is credibly neutral. These posts have been just small excerpts (not verbatim). I have a whole post on precisely the things you highlighted that I refrained from submitting yesterday as well as some of the content below  (and more). But I feared that without some pause for reflection and additional context of my whole thesis I\u2019ve been working on over the last 5+ years that it would be inadequate. Also my posts have already been long af!  To continue with this trend\u2026 sigh  On neutrality of money and resiliency to cultural shifts My thesis deviates from Rune\u2019s Endgame, but the end goal of \u201cUnbiased World Currency\u201d is the same. More specifically:  Money that is widely accepted where no one person, entity, or state controls the supply and anyone, anywhere can achieve, at a minimum, \u201cUniversal Basic Financial Access\u201d.  This is important for exactly the reasons you mentioned. Culture changes over time and space. Given that money is a tool for social consensus and commerce over time and space, it must be adaptable to differences and evolutions in culture. Historically (and to this day) money has also been perverted and used as tool for control precisely because of its ability to be mutated, censored or seized. The current FinTech and CBDC trend we are on will make this worse, not better. I believe the inherent properties of cryptocurrency can fix this.     ekryski:  verifiability, immutability, privacy, and programmability   Money should be suitably private and be sufficiently immutable and decentralized such that it is resistive enough to prevent full censorship and retain it\u2019s utility, while at the same time adaptable enough to reflect cultural shifts and fluctuations in demand so that it retains its purchasing power. If money loses the trust, and therefore the social consensus of the people that use it, it will fall out of favour for the next one that gains social consensus. Always has. Always will. The most critical properties that ensure that trust in \u201cgood money\u201d remains are:  Retaining its store of value over space and time (Stability. Namely, constant purchasing power); The ability to be a widely accepted medium of exchange over space and time (social/cultural consensus some that is forced by law and taxes); and A good record of account over space and time (immutable transaction history).  In all of the properties above, censorship resistance over space and time is critical for them to remain valid. If, at any point, people become concerned any one of these properties are threatened it will fall out of favour. My extreme view is that money is far too important a tool and our global economic system is far too complex for a small group of humans to manage. Not only can they be corrupted, which enables the ability to destroy one or more of the properties of good money, but the vastness of the variables and data required to ensure economic resiliency in our complex digital economy is better suited for computers and/or a collective global hive mind. @ameensol I think you might have an idea of what I mean by this because when you released RAI I thought, \u201cthis guy gets it\u201d, and much of my thesis is inspired by both DAI and RAI. As of late I\u2019ve been leaning more towards Ethan Buchman\u2019s thesis that our global economic system is structurally unsound and that there are clues in biology that would enable a more resilient and fluid system as opposed to the rigid one we currently use. I believe @rune might be thinking in a similar manner as mentioned in his Endgame post:    Endgame Plan v3 complete overview   A better but more abstract way to think of MetaDAOs, and in particular the incubation and bootstrapping of new MetaDAOs, is cell division. The precursor cell divides, leaving two new cells which share DNA and essential components and infrastructure - and from this starting point they can then specialize into the most beneficial function that maximally benefits their symbiosis.   The challenge, as we\u2019ve seen over history, and most recently during the pandemic, is that it\u2019s impossible for humans to coordinate and reach consensus at a large scale quickly enough to deal with such complex issues. Especially when they have different cultural values, locations, lives, and could be corrupted. Greed is a helluva drug. It\u2019s really a wonder that our financial system works at all!  I don\u2019t believe DAOs in their current form are the solution as they still rely on clunky and error prone human coordination. None of them today are really \u201cAutonomous\u201d. Some have a bit of the D (just the tip? ). But most are just O\u2019s - Internet native organizations or cooperatives. As we\u2019ve seen in the \u201creal world\u201d, cooperatives can work and undoubtedly programmable tokens with the right incentive structures are an incredible way to coordinate people to work towards common goals, so I haven\u2019t written them off entirely. But I think much more automation is required before meaningful potential is realized. My thesis is a holistic view on all these concepts. As you rightly pointed out @ameensol, without coalescing all these pieces, critical gaps are left unacknowledged.  Moving forward I want to be clear that while I may not have been as actively engaged due to time constraints (and some self doubt) I have been a supporter of DAI, RAI and all these other stablecoin experiments since their inception. I have been actively reading a lot of your guys\u2019 work over the years and very much respect it. I chose to speak up now because we\u2019re at a critical juncture if we want to see what I believe is a shared vision materialize - decentralized money. My only aim is to share my thoughts and knowledge in the hopes it might help us get there. In the long run I don\u2019t think we can build anything remotely effective unless we work together and have these important discussions. So thank you @ameensol for speaking up! And everyone else that has commented. This is really high level stuff!  I will post my full thesis on how I think crypto becomes money when it\u2019s fairly cohesive. Likely later in September because I have important personal and business issues to deal with over the next couple weeks. To rush it would be a disservice to this very complex and important topic as there is an insane amount of nuance that encompasses cryptography, distributed systems, economics, geopolitics, philosophy, history, and a bunch of hypothetical game theory scenarios. I believe a cohesive paper (or a separate long-form post like the Endgame) is a better medium. Please don\u2019t judge me harshly, but do criticize my comments and ideas ruthlessly. I won\u2019t be offended by that. I\u2019m putting out opinionated and potentially contentious views that I think are directionally correct based on a holistic view I developed after thousands of hours of research and experience in all the aforementioned areas - with the singular goal of how I think we can create a get a better more equitable monetary system. This is intentional so as to ignite important intellectual debate because my ideas will undoubtedly have flaws and the best answer will likely lie somewhere in between my view and counterpoints. I will welcome criticism. For now my thesis is exactly that at this stage. An idea still being refined (but close). Nothing more. Nothing less. And it is a bit of a distraction right now so I\u2019ll refrain from expanding any further in here. I don\u2019t want to further deviate from the original intent of @rune\u2019s post, which I feel is already starting to get lost. I\u2019m still reflecting on Rune\u2019s Endgame post. My gut reaction is it\u2019s far too complex and introduces more opportunities for governance risk and some of the collateral ratios seem a bit arbitrary. Occam\u2019s Razor\u2026 However, I find that rarely are my initial reactions correct with such complex systems like this because I\u2019m likely missing something. Especially when there are many unknowns and ya\u2019ll are smart af. So I need to let it percolate and will revisit periodically. We can debate the merits of decentralization, the inherent properties of money and how they could be integrated into a better version ad nauseam, but that\u2019s not the point of @rune\u2019s OP and we need to focus on what meaningful steps can be actionably put forward to minimize the risk of today\u2019s version of DAI. So with all that said, in the spirit of reverting back to the OP, the comment at the end of my previous post still stands. I\u2019ll clarify and elaborate:  Since any regulatory compliant version of DAI would require an entire protocol upgrade, and none of us really know how hard a crack down on DAI may be (it\u2019s all conjecture at this stage), I fully agree with @brianmcmichael that the first logical step would be to reduce RWA exposure in the current DAI version, prepare for maximally censorship resistance assuming that the on/off ramps can handle complying with OFAC because DAI is still presently traceable and the argument can be made that right now, precisely because DAI can\u2019t meaningfully be used as money in \u201cthe real world\u201d and would require an on/off ramp to do so, that the regulatory compliance burden belongs at the on/off ramps just the same as with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Upon reflection, if the community does want to support a more regulatory compliant version, then I think both could operate in parallel and I don\u2019t immediately see a ton of risk in doing so outside of opportunity cost. An upgrade from SAI to DAI was successful and quite smooth (which shocked me at the time tbh) so I don\u2019t see any reason why it can\u2019t be done again if necessary. If a new regulatory compliant stablecoin with RWA support is to be launched, it\u2019s probably better to give it a different name to minimize user and regulator confusion.     ACREinvest:  So, everyone should also appreciate that regulatory threats include a determination about the legal classification of MKR token and DAI, and whether its governance and the system of delegation is DeFi theater. This reality puts certain individuals and organizations participating in leadership, management and determination of outcomes in various cross-hairs depending on the facts and circumstances, and whether authorities want to make a case.   This doesn\u2019t address the valid MKR regulatory risk to governance that @ACREinvest points out above. But, I dunno, baby steps\u2026 I haven\u2019t thought enough about that to propose a good solution. I second @Ryan_Berckmans comment and think that @brianmcmichael\u2019s points are all actionable and valid at this stage if the goal is to reduce some of the regulatory and censorship risk to the current version of DAI. Onward!  ",

Maker is not alone in its fundamental reliance on fiat on/off ramps; institutional adoption (e.g., Dai listings); price oracles, etc. Ultimately, Dai being pegged to $1 is it\u2019s primary argument for adoption. Dai is a money market fund, backed by a variety of mostly liquid components (vaults) to be more resilient to volatility and runs on any particular vault. A shift to free floating should be avoided at all cost in my opinion. What I have always seen as Dai\u2019s #1 problem is low usage. With a (yes, overcollateralized) Market cap of ~$6.5B; annualized revenues of its largest vaults <$20M, and MKR tokens at only a $700M lender of last resort.

The answer in my opinion is not to give up the $1 peg and rebuild Dai and MKR - which ultimately doesn\u2019t solve for the centralization risks. The answer is to increase usage among the most decentralized vaults that generate revenue. I would like to see DeFi eat its own dog food. Protocol Owned Vaults is a good example. But more broadly, MakerDAO leveraging other DeFi protocols even more. One example I think is highly underexplored is concentrated, moving wBTC/wETH UNI v3 vaults. Similarly, ETH/rETH/stETH/cbETH Balancer pools. Higher usage = lower reliance on stablecoins & more revenue = a stronger Dai.  image800\u00d7691 53.4 KB  ",

I also think Rune is correct to try and protect DAI from nebulous regulatory risk, and that imposing negative rates to wean the protocol off USDC long term makes sense. With that said I will now respond to Eric\u2026  Culture changes over time and space. Given that money is a tool for social consensus and commerce over time and space, it must be adaptable to differences and evolutions in culture. Historically (and to this day) money has also been perverted and used as tool for control precisely because of its ability to be mutated, censored or seized. The current FinTech and CBDC trend we are on will make this worse, not better. I believe the inherent properties of cryptocurrency can fix this.  Empirically false: Gold has held up for 5,000 years as base money and made absolutely 0 adaptations along the way.  I believe the inherent properties of cryptocurrency can fix this.  Focusing on this for a sec\u2026 Eric seems to be out of the loop on the validator censorship discussion, where folks are discussing liability for validators who knowingly process tornado txs (or for any other sanctioned contracts / addresses). The only L1 I know of that uses a commit-reveal pattern for its txns to hide them from miners/validators and ensure censorship resistance at the protocol layer is Zcash. And it remains to be seen if the Ethereum social layer 0 is strong enough to enforce slashing stakers that might be OK with some state mandated censorship. So unfortunately censorship-resistance being an \u201cinherent property of cryptocurrency\u201d only happens if we fight to defend it, including against well-meaning censorship-favoring moralists. I\u2019d recommend watching this podcast with Justin Drake on Bankless where they discuss L1 censorship. I\u2019m watching now.  Money should be suitably private and be sufficiently immutable and decentralized such that it is resistive enough to prevent full censorship and retain it\u2019s utility, while at the same time adaptable enough to reflect cultural shifts and fluctuations in demand so that it retains its purchasing power. If money loses the trust, and therefore the social consensus of the people that use it, it will fall out of favour for the next one that gains social consensus. Always has. Always will.  Once again, this theorycrafting fails to explain the longevity of gold. Besides being easily divisible and measurable, a primary utility of gold is that no single entity controls its issuance or can censor transactions that use it as a medium. This makes it trustworthy enough for rival or even warring nations to hold gold and use it to conduct business, even during conflict. If anything, the idea of money losing trust applies more to the USD, which after the USA froze $600B of Russian assets, had its counterparty risk called into question.  Upon reflection, if the community does want to support a more regulatory compliant version, then I think both could operate in parallel and I don\u2019t immediately see a ton of risk in doing so outside of opportunity cost. An upgrade from SAI to DAI was successful and quite smooth (which shocked me at the time tbh) so I don\u2019t see any reason why it can\u2019t be done again if necessary.  This basically amounts to preemptively conceding to the US financial authorities. I think most people who care about decentralization would probably quit MakerDAO if this comes to pass. I would personally see no reason to use DAI over USDC in this case, as DAI would be the same product, without any additional benefits, and yet with additional risks.  But I do I think there are ways to disincentivize criminal activity such that it makes up a very small percentage of the aggregate transaction volume by surfacing select information transparently (like an addresses risk/reputation score) so that the network can self regulate and adapt to prevent what it considers high risk activity such that moving a large amount of money from criminal activity is slow, cumbersome and expensive vs. that of \u201cgood\u201d activity. This would require programmatic transaction volume thresholds and automatic transaction behaviour analysis at the protocol level in combination with social consensus of the network users themselves based the publicly available information.  In your next comment you basically lay out the authoritarian wet dream. Your plan is: \u201cprogrammatic transaction volume thresholds and automatic transaction behaviour analysis at the protocol level\u201d\u2026 Practically speaking, this would require per-tx censorship features on DAI, along with hooks for some authority to do the \u201cautomatic transaction behavior analysis\u201d, presumably to halt \u201cbad\u201d txs from ever taking place. This sounds far more like a USDC endgame strategy than one I would expect from DAI.

An upgrade from SAI to DAI was successful and quite smooth (which shocked me at the time tbh) so I don\u2019t see any reason why it can\u2019t be done again if necessary.  I speak for myself when I say: No, I do not want to support the more regulatory compliant version. There is USDC for that. I do not support the plan to sunset DAI in favor of OFAC-DAI. I would prefer if the risk of USDC was dealt with tactically, by using the inherent DAI peg incentives and such to wean Maker off USDC collateral. ",

Fun Fact: One of most highly valued jobs in Protector & Gamble (Gillette, Palmolive, toothpaste, etc.) with the greatest upward career prospects is that of a Brand Manager. Where the BM pipeline gets the Sales Department leads that get converted into a win (sale), and the Sales Department in return serves Marketing by reporting the type of customer demands that deserve a marketing campaign. I think that we can all agree that the current crypto UX negates all that by focusing on none of what P&G uses to its advantage. Crypto is currently Running an awful UX/UI that does not answer/resolve the question of complexity (how much effort is required to use the product once it\u2019s in place?), and perhaps it will never answer the question, if the Product is fit & finished (ex., is the product ready for prime time, or does it need more innovation).   Having worked at a P&G competitor I can tell that P&G operates in a fully commoditized industry. P&G stopped innovating decades ago. Every single product has no differentiation whatsoever, hence they need to focus on branding as the only asset to generate differentiated demand. Basically, these companies have a go-to-market roadmap of 5 years which they update quarterly. The industry is so dull that they can easily plan with 5 years in advance and still make it. Crypto, on the other hand, is an embryo in comparison, it will evolve and UX/UI and product market fit will arrive once the bedrock is cemented and stable. Why? because you can already see less DEFI primitives and fundamental innovations at lower levels of the whole stack. Will all these survive? nope, just a few and those will create the bedrock, once that is in place, UX/UI will be the only differentiation element that attracts demand and Branding, Design and psychological tricks such as \u2018likes\u2019 will come up in the crypto space as long as it is demanded that every single year the tokens appreciate and the markets demand moar moar moar. This constant demand of moar moar moar profits is what has led us to unsustainable supply chain and manufacturing model. Brand Managers feed the top of the funnel and the rest of the company outsources manufacturing to third-world countries with miserable wages and take the end product across the globe in cargo ships and planes that require tons of energy for a product that is totally similar to the next one in the shelf at the store, and most likely manufactured by the same factory with just a different sticker with a different brand on top. So basically, crypto in general and  DEFI need to be conscious that maximizing value extraction for holders will lead us to a similar place. Ideas like clean-money are a vision that must be encoded into the humans operating and into the code executing, it is too early, but important to keep in mind and not lose sight. ",

                    "content": "Trying to keep the response shorter because, outside of questions already posed from others in Rune\u2019s recent End Game clarification here, I don\u2019t have much more to add. To clarify my position I\u2019m personally fine with either:  Reducing RWA exposure and moving to more of a free float for this current version of DAI; Retaining RWA and reducing censorship risk on those assets, either through reg compliance, lobbying and/or strategic jurisdiction, asset and counterparty shopping (basically EndGame); or both  I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t try both tbh by launching a second coin. Especially since some of the aspects to reducing censorship risk would be applicable in both scenarios and if branded separately I think there is less risk of reputational risk. Biggest risk is opportunity cost, but this allows you to hedge your bets. Since we really don\u2019t know which strategy will be best adopted and on what timeline because there are tons of external factors out of our control, I think we should treat it like an A/B test and whichever one gains the most usage will win - maximally censorship resistant vs. dollar pegged stability.  But to respond to to @ameensol\u2019s outtakes above (which I do appreciate ).     ameensol:  Empirically false: Gold has held up for 5,000 years as base money and made absolutely 0 adaptations along the way.   Until we moved into more rapid global trade and the digital era\u2026 it\u2019s no longer adequate base money due to population growth and technology expansion outpacing the more inelastic supply curve. This has resulted in immense counterparty risk and censorship. I agree that it\u2019s still one of the best base monies (maybe even the best?) we have today but our rapid digitization has eroded much of its censorship resistance at scale, so we need a better option. Bitcoin isn\u2019t it. I expand on this in my paper.     ameensol:  Eric seems to be out of the loop on the validator censorship discussion, where folks are discussing liability for validators who knowingly process tornado txs (or for any other sanctioned contracts / addresses).   Not out of the loop at all. Potentially a big issue. Especially when we already have group\u2019s like Hetzner killing all node hosting on a whim. Also partially addressed in the paper. More specifically, a better way to scale. The lack of scalability of all blockchain ecosystems has less to do with tx throughput and is mostly driven by the economics of storing so much global state, which most network participants don\u2019t even care about. 99.9% of the transactions that happen in the network are not mine. Unless I\u2019m looking at aggregate txs across a network (ie. surveillance for compliance, trading, etc.) I only care about my own transactions and that when I undertake a transaction the counterparty didn\u2019t double spend. Currently nearly every blockchain gives you an all or nothing approach, which inhibits self hosting and scalability because of the vast amount of data. Essentially what I\u2019m leaning towards is a combo of ZkPs and extreme sharding.     ameensol:  Once again, this theorycrafting fails to explain the longevity of gold. Besides being easily divisible and measurable, a primary utility of gold is that no single entity controls its issuance or can censor transactions that use it as a medium. This makes it trustworthy enough for rival or even warring nations to hold gold and use it to conduct business, even during conflict. If anything, the idea of money losing trust applies more to the USD, which after the USA froze $600B of Russian assets, had its counterparty risk called into question.   Fair point. Agree that gold is better than USD as SoV and censorsip resistance but clearly in the world we live in right now, not as good as MoE as USD. For both gold and USD the RoA is shit because it\u2019s highly centralized, especially in our globalized and digital world. My point is that our culture evolved through digitization and globalization to a point where what was previously good money became inadequate and now we need a better solution, which crypto tech can enable, if done right.     ameensol:  This basically amounts to preemptively conceding to the US financial authorities. I think most people who care about decentralization would probably quit MakerDAO if this comes to pass. I would personally see no reason to use DAI over USDC in this case, as DAI would be the same product, without any additional benefits, and yet with additional risks.   Yes and no. But you\u2019re misinterpreting some of my intent and the mechanics. Likely my fault do to lack of context on all the intricacies.     ameensol:  In your next comment you basically lay out the authoritarian wet dream. Your plan is: \u201cprogrammatic transaction volume thresholds and automatic transaction behaviour analysis at the protocol level\u201d\u2026 Practically speaking, this would require per-tx censorship features on DAI, along with hooks for some authority to do the \u201cautomatic transaction behavior analysis\u201d, presumably to halt \u201cbad\u201d txs from ever taking place. This sounds far more like a USDC endgame strategy than one I would expect from DAI.   No. State wouldn\u2019t have hooks. Again will provide more context in paper on the mechanics.  To best clarify my position on how I think we get crypto to become a better version of global money will be in a much longer for paper that expands on all this in detail. Many things are fundamentally different from DAI so I\u2019m going to refrain on commenting on this stuff any further in here. Appreciate the comments but I think the better focus should be on deciding whether to keep RWA exposure in this current version of DAI and the challenges and opportunities associated with it. My main intent from my very first post in here was to highlight that there are risks with either strategy and just because you become censorship resistant, doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll get wide adoption (which to me is the core to true decentralization). In fact, I still believe that precisely because of extreme censorship resistance and privacy you wouldn\u2019t get wide adoption because too many people would be scared to touch it after a ban and you won\u2019t cross the chasm to wide enough adoption to regain censorship resistance through wide distribution. There is a very real chance I\u2019m wrong on this. That the world goes to shit and everyone needs to use a totally private cryptocurrency because they\u2019re terrified of autocratic leaders but I\u2019m more of an optimist and after speaking with many political leaders don\u2019t think there are many that want to be in that world either. @rune\u2019s End Game says to keep for 3 years or until we see more risk of censorship while positioning to offload censorable RWA faster than it could be done now. If this what people want then it would be better to discuss how we do that. I personally think this is a pragmatic approach but the 3 years seems arbitrary to me and I think you\u2019d still want to move as fast as possible, particularly because the Pigeon Stance doesn\u2019t contemplate lobbying or changing the protocol to guarantee regulatory compliance. Things out of your control can change quickly\u2026 If the goal is to very quickly become maximally censorship resistant then as I stated previously I support @brianmcmichael\u2019s suggestions. I would argue many of them are also applicable even with the End Game. Brian is no dummy.  So at this point I feel like I\u2019ve slightly derailed this topic, am not adding much value, and would like to return to actionable shit. My personal view is there should be a governance vote on whether to proceed with maintaining RWA or to remove it ASAP, or try both in parallel. From there we can decide the best way to attack that goal. ",
