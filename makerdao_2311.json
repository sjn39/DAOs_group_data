                    "content": "Discussion: Change the Stability Fee Structure Based on the discussion over the past week it seems there were no strong objections to proceeding with this initiative. The main points of contention were around naming and the negative base rate. I\u2019ve decided to run a 4 polls to cover these points of contention as well as a poll to cover something which wasn\u2019t really discussed - the polling cadence of the vault portion of the fee.  The General Idea The first poll is on whether you in general like the idea of splitting the stability fees into two separate components - one global fee portion (the Base Rate) and one per-vault fee portion (Name to be Voted).     Yes, I want to proceed with the change to split the stability fees into two components. No, I like things the way they are. No, I have a different way to proceed. Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection) Abstain (I want to see the results) Abstain (I have no opinion)     0 voters      Naming I saw no objection to the term Base Rate to refer to the global portion of the fee, so I\u2019ll assume that is okay to proceed with. There have been three terms floated for the vault portion of the fee. I will summarize as best I can.  Risk Premium Argument For: The vault-specific portion of the fee will mostly if not completely consist of the risk premium. Historically this is the term most people seem to use and understand.  Vault Fee Argument For: The Risk Premium is not the only part of the vault-specific portion, and so we should generalize the term to include future pieces such as collateral-specific taxes/subsidies.  Vault Spread Argument For: Similar argument to Vault Fee, but use the term spread as it may be less confusing to the vault owners. With Base Rate and Vault Spread as the main terms it is still clear that Stability Fee is what they will be paying and it won\u2019t be confused with the vault-specific portion. There is also a symmetry surrounding the name Spread as the DSR Spread and Vault Spread both extend from the Base Rate in opposite directions. Pick your preference:     Risk Premium Vault Fee Vault Spread Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection) Abstain (I want to see the results) Abstain (I have no opinion)     0 voters      Negative Base Rate Under this new system we have: Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Vault-specific Fee, 0%) A negative Base Rate allows us to achieve a target Stability Fee of 0%. Without the negative Base Rate the lowest Stability Fee we can achieve is whatever the vault-specific fee of the collateral is. Keep in mind this is a governance construct and does not correspond to any system parameters being negative. For example, let\u2019s say risk comes back and tells us that the Risk Premiums are as follows: ETH-A = 2% BAT-A = 2% USDC-A = 10% WBTC-A = 12% to encode the current setup of ETH-A Stability Fee = 0%, BAT-A SF = 0%, USDC-A SF = 0%, WBTC-A SF = 1% we can do this: Base Rate = -11% (MKR is subsidizing the risk premium in exchange for peg stability) ETH-A SF = max(2% + (-11%), 0%) = max(-9%, 0%) = 0% BAT-A SF = max(2% + (-11%), 0%) = max(-9%, 0%) = 0% USDC-A SF = max(10% + (-11%), 0%) = max(-1%, 0%) = 0% WBTC-A SF = max(12% + (-11%), 0%) = max(1%, 0%) = 1% I will attempt to summarize the pros/cons:  Pros  Allows more flexibility in what we can vote on in the weekly poll. Without a negative Base Rate reaching a Stability Fee of 0% requires initiating one-off votes for each of the vault-specific fees. Makes it explicit when we are subsidizing risk with MKR. Base Rate > 0% means the system should be bringing in revenue. Base Rate < 0% means the system should be taking on debt. In an ideal world the Base Rate should always be >= 0%, but it\u2019s good to have this option available.   Cons  Too complex. It\u2019s simpler for voters and users to not have to deal with a negative rate. MKR subsidies for risk should be a rare occurrence. We have the tools available with the vault-specific portion votes to set Stability Fees to 0% so why complicate this more than necessary when it will not be used that often.  Pick your preference on allowing a negative Base Rate:     Yes, allow a negative Base Rate. Disallow a negative Base Rate. 0% Base Rate will be the minimum. Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection) Abstain (I want to see the results) Abstain (I have no opinion)     0 voters      Vault-specific Polling Cadence One of the reasons to make this fee split is to reduce the number of weekly governance fee votes from 1 per vault type to some smaller number for scaling purposes. The two options I see are having the vault-specific portions of the fee voted on at either an infrequent, but regular voting period or on an as-needed basis. An example of the as-needed basis is if the risk team shows that the risk premium has changed for ETH-A and it needs to be adjusted.     We should vote on vault-specific fees at an infrequent, but regular interval. We should vote on vault-specific fees on an as-needed basis. Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection) Abstain (I want to see the results) Abstain (I have no opinion)     0 voters     Polls will run until Thursday May 14th at 11:00am EST to be discussed on the weekly governance call. Possibility for extension if there is not a clear answer by then. ",

Also, I would like to hear some arguments for why people do not want the negative base rate? I feel like we are shooting ourselves in the foot by not including this. In the current market it\u2019s clear MKR holders want to subsidize the risk of ETH to defend the peg. We will lose this monetary tool if we only allow for a positive base rate. I understand we can initiate one-off votes for each collateral type, but why do this when we can encode this goal into an existing weekly tool? ",

IF we wanted to keep it at 30% i think that would be doable but you would need an executive vote to reduce the \u201crisk premium\u201d on USDC-B to 27%. That said, IMO i don\u2019t think this would be necessary given that in this hypothetical we would be looking at a more bullish crypto-economic cycle, but i think that is how it would work. ",

Lets take this Executive that passed shortly after the \u201cblack thursday\u201d event as an example. We didn\u2019t hold a bunch of on-chain polls where we decided what every one of those numbers should be. The risk team just proposed several of those numbers on the forums and a few hours later we ratified them on-chain. I think that in this scenario where we have another black swan event we would likely act similarly, so I don\u2019t really see this as a big of a concern as we are making it out to be. Also FWIW, this idea of 4 polls doesn\u2019t seem THAT crazy to me. Looking at this last event as a sort of a disaster response prototype, I think that it is likely that after any black swan event we will see a huge rate cut followed by a few weeks of price discovery where we try out progressively lower stability fees. Maybe next time it will play out differently idk, but it seems fairly reasonable that MKR holders would want to test the waters at a few different pricing points on our way to 0% as opposed to going from 8% to 0% overnight.

I would rather focus on a slower drawdown like what happened in 2018 where ETH dropped from $1400 USD to $80 over the course of a year. I think we would all agree that something like this has a decent chance of happening again in the next few years. Not sure if you were around back then but the Stability Fee for SCD sat at 0.5% for most of the year IIRC. Under a no negative Base Rate scenario having a Stability Fee this low is unachievable within the weekly monetary policy cycle. Instead we would have to initiate a Risk Premium change poll to cover a monetary policy decision. Why not keep risk separate from monetary policy if we can instead of muddling them together during bear markets? Another point I want to make is that yes it is only 4 polls now, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm of possibility that we have hundreds of collateral types in the future. If we don\u2019t ignore the governance process, do you really want to initiate hundreds of polls to adjust the Risk Premiums to adjust for a monetary policy decision of wanting more borrowing? Especially when we could have a tool to include this inside the existing monetary lever. ",

I think what is fairly likely is that we end up with 10s of different collateral types lets say 50 and that those 50 collateral types follow a sort of Pareto distribution in terms of their overall contribution to the DAI supply. I.E we are going to be in a situation where we have maybe 10 different collateral types that we really care about and would likely change their risk premium if the market situation demanded it and bunch more types of collateral that we aren\u2019t really that concerned with that can just ride the base rate as it moves.

The idea that we need a constant addition (ax + b) and so a 3rd variable is moot I think. We don\u2019t need a constant add, we can just multiply the base rate by a collateral specific risk variable (which in the future could be formalized and tied to volatility or some other objective metric for that collateral). Adding a constant offset from zero would give all of the bad parts of an additive system, and doesn\u2019t benefit us in my opinion. We want all total rates to go to zero as we lower the base rate. In the event of a crisis where we need maximum liquidity, we can just set base rate to zero and all total rates will be set to zero. This has the advantage too that any adjustment in the base rate will adjust all total rates proportionally to risk, whereas with an additive system, upward adjustments could still have most collateral types unchanged at 0% while a few go positive in a discontinuous way. Personally I find this all much more intuitive than having negative base rates, having to think about maxs and mins, etc. These are all confusing technical details for lay people. ",

That being said I have a few concerns with this:   It would too rapidly price out collateral with higher Risk Premiums. For example if ETH-A is 2% RP and wBTC RP is 10%. Now let\u2019s say it\u2019s Feb 2020 before the market crash where ETH-A was at a SF of around 8%. Under an additive system this would put the Base Rate at 6% giving wBTC a SF of 16% which is high, but I can still see vaults being made at this number. Now with a Base Rate of 4x in the multiplicative situation we have wBTC SF of 40% which I doubt very many vaults would be created at that level.   Striving for positive numbers in all your fees is pretty arbitrary and shouldn\u2019t be used as a reason for one system or the other.   Overall it\u2019s an interesting concept. I just view the additive as a more appropriate fit. ",

But when we see truly uncorrelated and novel assets be added to MCD this fee structure is not going to work well: Let\u2019s take the ETH bull run that pushed up the ETH SF to 8% last year as an example. If at the time we would have allowed people to borrow DAI against their house it\u2019s unlikely that this asset class would have seen as much of a spike in utilization as traders using MCD to get leverage. The fictional tokenized real estate loans from my example would be relatively stable low yield assets. This means that adding a base rate to these assets would mean the next time there\u2019s a massive ETH bull run you\u2019d potentially price out an entire segment of uncorrelated borrowers that add a huge amount of stability to the system. Pricing out a large segment of stable low volume assets would achieve the goal of lowering the DAI supply but it making these borrowers default on their mortgages would probably scare them away for good. The more stable we make the stability fee the better. That is true for volatile assets as much as it is true for less volatile assets. However the same amount of volatility can make it impractical for some assets while it won\u2019t do so for others. I think in a situation where DAI supply is too high, it\u2019s not just a matter of looking at how much the stability fee should raise but also to look at the collateral types used to generate DAI.

It is low overhead, and the impact of that should not be underestimated, especially as the collateral portfolio grows. If necessary, we could always vote to exclude certain assets from the base-rate changes. With regards to the trade-offs, we have something like this: Option 1: Up the base-rate in a bull market and price out certain assets + May quickly destroy a large amount of DAI, which would have an immediate impact on the peg. + More stability fees for the same amount of DAI. + Allows us to use the DSR freely to effect demand. - Temporarily reduces diversification in the protocol. - Priced out assets may not come back to the protocol. Option 2: Up the rate on only the bullish assets + Reduces downward pressure on DAI peg from a specific asset. + Maintains diversification in the protocol. + No assets priced out. - Limits our ability to use the DSR freely to effect demand. - Less stability fees for the same amount of DAI.  With regards specifically to centrifuge and other assets (like mortgages) that prefer a low stability fee a solution is to have somewhere else on-chain to which these assets can refinance. In this way, these assets can move in and out of the Maker Protocol dependent on whether it can offer the best rate at any given time, which will be dependent on the level of DAI demand. Alternatively, I know there are some projects that want to provide a fixed rate as a layer sitting on top of the Maker Protocol. Using the base rate makes the protocol very much a market driven thing: Whomever is willing to pay the most in fees gets to use the protocol. Changing rates individually is a more active approach that there may or may not be appetite for managing. But all this said, the primary issue is the DSR. It is dangerous to increase the DSR higher than the SF on any asset. This gives lenders using those collateral packages the ability to leech DAI out of the protocol. ",

In this sense we have not lost any flexibility as this can still be encoded into the Risk Premium portion of the fee. The Risk Premium could very well be negative in the same way  (hopefully) the Base Rate can be. This would be a protocol-level subsidization to push for more of this collateral type. Going negative with the Risk Premium has some concerns with the DSR though as LFW pointed out. I\u2019m not sure we even want to do it, but it is still there as an option if we choose. ",

Even as a governance construct, when you suggest to name something a Vault-specific fee, risk management may read this as a specific \u201cinterest rate\u201d applied to a particular vault or cluster of vaults. Which in other words, in a risk world induces the idea of Risk-based pricing for individual vaults or clusters of. In normal risk setting, to be able to assign an individual vault \u201ccharge\u201d you would have to determine first a \u201cProbability of Default\u201d (PD) and \u201cLoss Given Default\u201d LGD metric to each vault, which would determine the risk premium of that specific vault and therefore the \u201cinterest rate\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d by the protocol. As far as I can tell, up until this point, that individual PD for each vault is not defined. So I would probably suggest rethinking the use of Vault-specific Fee.

It kind of gets away from this idea that the premium is 100% based on risk and also does not conflict with existing financial terminology like risk premium would I had thought that @williamr was suggesting new terminology but on a second read it looks like that is not the case. Maybe I will restate my question as more of a statement: It looks like \u201crisk premium\u201d is going to be the winner on the terminology poll, but the options in that poll were based on a limited set of options discussed in the original discussion thread. If anyone else has suggestions as to what might a preferable terminology this thread seems to be drawing to a close and the next steps are likely on-chain polls, so you might want to speak those opinions before we move into next steps.

I think that the stability fee structure will have to be made more complex when some other collateral types are added. At that point, I think the collateral portfolio will have to be divided into segments, with a different base fee/rate adjustment policy for each segment. Examples of collateral types that will need to live in a different segment to liquid cryptoassets like ETH, BTC, etc.:  Illiquid assets Assets with a fixed maturity, or assets that are typically held for a fixed period of time Assets deriving value from the real economy Fixed income assets  For some of these, it may be necessary to lock in a fixed stability fee for a certain period of time, in order to not expose the DAI borrower to excessive variable rate risk (the opposite side of this is that Maker governance needs to price in the fixed rate risk on our side). For others, the stability fee could be adjustable but behind a time lock, or governance could simply pledge to follow some stability fee adjustment policy that is known in advance. Others could have stability fees that are continuously adjustable following a base spread derived from a LIBOR oracle, etc. ",

For refence, our soon to be system for determining Vault stability fees is: SFv = Base Fee + Risk Premium Say there exists a class of collaterals in the future that we want to remain at a set SF. We could introduce a third parameter to the equation: SFv = Base Fee * Fixed Rate Factor + Risk Premium On normal collaterals, FRF would remain at 1. On collaterals where a fixed rate is desired, FRF would be set to 0, and the Stability Fee would rely solely on the Risk Premium. This is how i see it working in the future. I would like the current proposal to pass the executive first, and then this system (or similar) can be added in later on. Innitially I would see the FRF either being set at 0 or 1. But it could be later set to any positive (or negative) value. ",

                    "content": "Motivation Now that we have started onboarding more collateral types and SCD is shutting down, I believe we should start thinking about how to restructure the stability fee votes from their current form. Currently we have the following governance fee polls: Dai Stability Fee -> Sets the stability fee for both ETH-A and BAT-A. USDC Stability Fee -> Sets the stability fee for USDC-A. Presumably if wBTC is added that would be yet another separate, weekly stability fee vote. This system made sense at the start of MCD as there was really only one type of collateral available (ETH). As we add more collateral types it will become unwieldy to vote on each collateral\u2019s stability fee each week. I believe it\u2019s time to refactor how we are voting on the fees before the flood gates of collateral are opened. Proposal I propose we refactor this legacy setup to the following:   The weekly \u201cDai Stability Fee\u201d vote becomes the \u201cBase Rate\u201d vote. The base rate will remain a weekly vote to control for peg stability. The Dai Savings Rate Spread poll will continue to be a delta from the Base Rate poll.   All vault types (ETH-A, BAT-A, etc) get a \u201cVault Fee\u201d that is voted on only when needed. The vault \u201cStability Fee\u201d is calculated as Base Rate + Vault Fee. I want to call this a more general \u201cVault Fee\u201d instead of \u201cRisk Premium\u201d because it may consist of more factors then just the Risk Premium in the future. Terminology is not a big deal though if more people prefer the term \u201cRisk Premium\u201d or something else.   The Base Rate can be negative to allow for MKR subsidization of peg support (such as what we are doing now).   Encoding of these governance parameters into the Maker system variables works as follows:   If Base Rate is positive: base = Base Rate duty = Vault Fee If Base Rate is negative: base = 0 duty = max(Vault Fee + Base Rate, 0) This conditional is only because both base and duty can only be positive. For example to encode the current setup of ETH-A = 0%, BAT-A = 0% and USDC-A = 6% we can do this: Base Rate = -2% (MKR is subsidizing the risk premium in exchange for peg stability) ETH-A Vault Fee = 2% (Risk Premium of 2%) BAT-A Vault Fee = 2% USDC-A Vault Fee = 8% If wBTC is added with a target Stability Fee of 1% (as per the governance poll currently up), then it would get a Vault Fee of 3%. This allows us to set the relative risks between collateral types once and move all the fees up and down in tandem to control overall Dai supply (and thus peg stability). It should not matter which collateral type is used to generate Dai. The only thing that matters is that moving the Base Rate down pushes Dai supply up on average and moving the Base Rate up pushes supply down on average. I will leave about a week or so for some feedback before moving to a signalling thread. ",

Similar to when we adopted a DSR spread instead of a direct vote on the DSR. It seems more complex so why do it? We do it because by switching to the DSR Spread we were able to reduce the number of governance votes required per week. Similarly I am proposing this change to the fee structure to decrease our collective cognitive load and sharpen the votes to particular questions. There is really only one control that we need to be voting on every week and that is the peg stability control. Does it make sense to tweak 10 stability fees every week once we reach 10 collateral types? I\u2019m of the opinion this is an inefficient way to think about the problem. So if our goal is to ideally have one peg stability control then what does it look like? To me this looks like a base rate, but different vaults have different risk profiles so you need some way to add that on top. If we take this approach then the negative base rate falls out of this if you want the ability to bring the stability fees to 0% like what we have now. We haven\u2019t explicitly pointed it out but in fact MKR is subsidizing the risk premium for ETH right now. The negative base rate is nice because it makes the decision to start this subsidy an explicit choice. I welcome criticism, but would prefer an alternative implemenation rather than just saying this sounds confusing we should stick with the status quo. The status quo will not scale. ",

                    "content": "Yes, a base rate makes a lot of sense to reduce cognitive load. I disagree though on the DSR spread being more complex, I think it\u2019s quite straightforward. Changing the governance cadence for the stablecoin rate premium is another matter not for this thread. It\u2019s an interesting idea to bake in a 2% risk premium on ETH-A, making a subsidy an explicit choice. Yes this trick could have a strong psychological effect. But my point still stands that it makes it needlessly complicated, increasing cognitive load. A 2% risk premium is also arbitrary, and if the ETH-A risk premium can be adjusted, it brings question to what actually the \u2018base rate\u2019 means. Also, the same change could be applied to the DSR spread vote. A 0% DSR spread is a subsidy in the current form. Is the DSR spread going to be connected to the base rate or the ETH-A rate? Does this bake in a 2% risk premium on the DSR spread? (Base rate 0%, ETH-A 2% risk premium, 0% DSR spread = 0% DSR) That\u2019s definitely interesting. We don\u2019t explicitly point out that a 0% DSR spread is a subsidy, but MKR holders can be smart enough to understand that a 0% ETH-A sf is a subsidy and a 0% DSR spread is a subsidy. We don\u2019t need to bake in risk premiums. It\u2019s also opens a can of worms to argue about. Is a 1% ETH-A SF a subsidy? Is a 0.5% DSR spread a subsidy? And all the arguing is a bit pointless because you\u2019re just deciding on a psychological value.     hexonaut:  I welcome criticism, but would prefer an alternative implemenation rather than just saying this sounds confusing we should stick with the status quo. The status quo will not scale.   Yes, this is criticism but I am not suggesting the status quo.     hexonaut:  For example to encode the current setup of ETH-A = 0%, BAT-A = 0% and USDC-A = 6% we can do this: Base Rate = -2% (MKR is subsidizing the risk premium in exchange for peg stability) ETH-A Vault Fee = 2% (Risk Premium of 2%) BAT-A Vault Fee = 2% USDC-A Vault Fee = 8%   My suggestion: Base Rate = 0% ETH-A Vault Rate Premium = 0% BAT-A Vault Rate Premium = 0% WBTC-A Vault Rate Premium = 1% USDC-A Vault Rate Premium = 6% This is similar to the DSR spread argument of making things simpler to reduce votes. Vault Rate Premiums just make a lot more sense when the ETH-A vault premium is 0%. In your case, if you wanted to lower the ETH-A premium from 2%->1%, you might want to lower the WBTC premium from 3%-2% at the same time also. ",

Maybe ETH-A Spread is a better term? In reality this Vault Fee or Spread including Base Rate compensates peg stability, risk and other costs (DSR, etc). I think the idea is that changing Base rate just simplifies the process and makes it more clear that all assets are affected equally when changed. Also the Base Rate alone may not be enough to control peg stability. You may run into a situation where one asset generates too much DAI and you may need to raise only its Spread and don\u2019t touch the Base Rate. ",

I made an assumption that you were arguing for the status quo because your answer was very short, critical and didn\u2019t present an alternative. My apologies on that assumption. I have some rebuttals:     Jiecut:  We don\u2019t explicitly point out that a 0% DSR spread is a subsidy, but MKR holders can be smart enough to understand that a 0% ETH-A sf is a subsidy and a 0% DSR spread is a subsidy. We don\u2019t need to bake in risk premiums. It\u2019s also opens a can of worms to argue about. Is a 1% ETH-A SF a subsidy? Is a 0.5% DSR spread a subsidy? And all the arguing is a bit pointless because you\u2019re just deciding on a psychological value.   A 0% DSR Spread is not a MKR subsidy. It is the opposite. A DSR Spread of anything above 0% is a tax on the system that goes to MKR holders instead of from them.     Jiecut:  My suggestion: Base Rate = 0% ETH-A Vault Rate Premium = 0% BAT-A Vault Rate Premium = 0% WBTC-A Vault Rate Premium = 1% USDC-A Vault Rate Premium = 6% This is similar to the DSR spread argument of making things simpler to reduce votes. Vault Rate Premiums just make a lot more sense when the ETH-A vault premium is 0%. In your case, if you wanted to lower the ETH-A premium from 2%->1%, you might want to lower the WBTC premium from 3%-2% at the same time also.   So this is basically the same, but you seem to be moving the subsidy into the risk premium / vault fee (which should be voted on infrequently). So my 2% number for ETH-A / BAT-A is an example of what the risk premium might be. Really this number should be provided by the risk team, set once and not adjusted unless the risk premium actually changes. This is why I don\u2019t want to store the subsidy into risk premium as currently the subsidy is in place because of the peg and will probably need to be adjusted on a weekly basis. I also want to keep these votes separate. The real ETH-A risk premium is very likely to be above 0% and if we don\u2019t allow for a negative Base Rate then the only way to get the total Stability Fee down to 0% is to have a bunch of risk premium votes which need to be initiated outside of the weekly Base Rate. This global subsidy only makes sense to me as a peg stabilizer hence why I think it should be included in the global Base Rate parameter. For example let\u2019s say in the future the ETH-A / BAT-A risk premiums are determined to be 1% (same as wBTC), and we have a regular weekly vote on the Base Rate which can\u2019t be negative. All of a sudden a Black Thursday type event happens and we really need to get all collateral types as close to 0% borrow rate as possible. With your proposed alternative we would have initiate N (N = num collateral types) risk premium / vault fee votes to achieve this goal. With my proposal we can achieve this inside the weekly Base Rate vote by saying we want a negative Base Rate.     Primoz:  Also the Base Rate alone may not be enough to control peg stability. You may run into a situation where one asset generates too much DAI and you may need to raise only its Spread and don\u2019t touch the Base Rate.   Completely agree, but I suspect this will be infrequent enough to be manageable on a monthly, ad-hoc timeframe instead of a week-to-week one. It may make sense to have a per-vault tax/subsidy as well as a risk premium portion with the Vault Fee / Vault Spread which is why I didn\u2019t want to call the entire vault portion of the fee the Risk Premium. Really it should be Stability Fee = Base Rate (global) + Risk Premium (per-vault) + Collateral-specific Tax/Subsidy (per-vault), but I think that will be easy enough to add in later and don\u2019t want to overcomplicate this initial change. PS I like the term Vault Spread as well as it is sort of the opposite of the DSR Spread. ",

With an increasing number of collateral types this is the way things are going anyway so we might as well implement your proposed system sooner rather than later. Some comments: 2. \u201cVault fee\u201d is a slightly misleading term as the fee you are proposing is collateral type specific, not vault specific. A more presice term could be \u201cCollateral type fee\u201d or something along that line.

The main reason that I see is that it avoids confusion.
