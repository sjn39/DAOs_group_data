While the current net inflow to the System Surplus is pretty low, we might end up in very quickly filling up the Buffer in case of a lot of Liquidations Penalties being collected during a big market drop. If this happens, we will start flapping and with that burning some MKR - this happened during Wild Wednesday and imho it was quite sad we did not use this event to fill the Buffer properly. Following up on the Informal Poll about Increasing the Surplus Buffer I would like to initiative the next step for changing the Surplus Buffer.  Increasing the Surplus Buffer  Pros:  no MKR burning until die System Surplus filled the Surplus Buffer if the system goes underwater, fewer MKR will be flopped as the System Surplus can get a lot higher than right now   Cons:  no MKR burning until die System Surplus filled the Surplus Buffer DAI in System Surplus is DAI taken out of circulation (not a big issue anymore, the supply side is elastic due to the PSM)  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     60 MM (no change) 70 MM (+10 MM) 80 MM (+20 MM) 100 MM (+40 MM) Abstain     0 voters     I will not ask for lerping this up (will reconsider if there is huge push back in the comments), as I feel lerping to the new desired level kind of defeats the purpose (no accidental flaps on huge market drop)  Next Step This Poll will run until 2021-09-17T12:00:00Z; its outcome will result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

As MKR falls, the protocol buys it back supporting the price. The only risk I see is that we flap too much.  That is, that the keeper market isn\u2019t strong enough to support a large number of flaps. I would also say that people should check reddit for the PR fallout from not burning.  If we are going to take a pure growth approach, that should be articulated continuously to MKR holders as actions like this are breaking the MKR burn narrative. Minimally, this is the reason for lerping to these targets, it is the compromise with MKR holders that want a burn and those that don\u2019t. ",
