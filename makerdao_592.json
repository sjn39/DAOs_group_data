                    "content": "Hi everyone  I feel like these past days of high market volatility (ie. Flappy Friday) has painfully pointed out that the state of UIs built for interacting with auctions (CLIP, FLAP and FLOP auctions) is fragmented, somewhat deprecated and clunky. With this thread I hope to create some clarity on the state of these UIs, where they are going and lastly announce some short-term measures to increase discoverability of the appropriate UIs for end-users.  Context Ever since the Maker Foundation dissolved into MakerDAO, certain codebases (including the auctions UIs) were orphaned\u2014they no longer had explicit owners that were mandated to maintain & improve them. The auctions UIs are unfortunately part of those, although this problem is not solely limited to the domain of auctions. @SES-Core-Unit is doing a great job in onboarding new CUs to explicitly own some of these domains (eg. @sidestream-core-unit), but it takes time for these newer teams to find their footing and fully master the codebases or build out their replacements. Until then, various Core Units (eg. DUX and TechOps) are collaborating to monitor some of these orphaned UIs and keep them functional.  An up-to-date overview of auction UIs Right now there are three UIs in the MakerDAO ecosystem that allow for interacting with auctions\u2014varying in functionality and user-friendliness. This is obviously confusing to users, especially given that there is a lack of documentation/clarity on how/when to use these UIs.   Liquidations Portal (old)  Used for CLIP auctions (collateral auctions). Not explicitly owned by a CU but currently maintained (ie. kept functional) by DUX and TechOps Core Units.    Auctions Portal (old)  Used to manually participate in FLAP and FLOP auctions (surplus and debt auctions)\u2014keepers participate in these auctions directly without this UI. Built in a short amount of time in the wake of Black Thursday. Currently not explicitly owned by a CU.    Unified Auctions UI (new, by SAS CU)  Allows for using flashloans to participate in collateral auctions without posting collateral\u2014users only pay for the transaction costs of executing the arbitrage. Serves as a \u201clanding page\u201d for auctions\u2014use this website to find UIs, tools and repos. [see screenshot below  ]  Currently the best option for participating in most CLIP auctions (collateral auctions) but does not yet support all ilks, nor does it support bidding with own assets instead of using flashloans. Does not yet support FLAP and FLOP auctions (surplus and debt auctions). Explicitly owned by @sidestream-core-unit      Screenshot 2022-01-25 at 16.39.18793\u00d7867 195 KB  Sidestream CU is doing a great job building out their new Unified Auctions UI and it is set to fully replace the aforementioned two UIs. Their new UI is, however, not at feature parity yet and a transition period is in effect where Sidestream CU collaborates with various other teams (eg. DUX, CES) until their UI fully supports all functionalities required. This work is part of the on-chain collateral management initiative (CMON) facilitated by @Davidutro. tl;dr: The state of auctions UIs is a mess currently, but a newly onboarded Core Unit is working hard to cover all bases.  Low-hanging fruit: Increase discoverability of UIs In collaboration with @lukass of the @sidestream-core-unit we have defined a couple of short-term measures that would increase the discoverability of the right UIs for end-users.   @dux-core-unit adds a banner to the old Liquidations Portal, informing users of the newly built Unified Auctions UI.  @sidestream-core-unit adds banners/indicators to ilks that are not yet supported by the new Unified Auctions UI, redirecting users to the old Liquidations Portal. Throughout MakerDAO\u2019s websites and documentation we make sure to point users to the Unified Auctions UI\u2014this page serves as a landing page for all things auctions, given that it includes explainers and up-to-date links to all relevant resources. This includes makerdao.com, makerdao.world, vote.makerdao.com, etc. Through the CMON initiative we continue to work through this transition phase until @sidestream-core-unit is ready to fully own the domain of auction UIs\u2014we can then decide on the fate of the older UIs and their URLs.  edit1: LFW added a Flappy Friday tag edit2: I added the point that the old Auctions Portal is used to manually participate in auctions and that keepers participate directly.
