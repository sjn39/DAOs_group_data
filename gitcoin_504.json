That\u2019s the entire problem of sybil. It\u2019s just an ethereum address. They just abandon it and make another one. So what user data would you forward to other DAOs?  Operational functions of fraud detection  That section needs better formatting and re-wording a bit. I found it quite hard to read and understand. At least split the subsections into their own paragraphs.  All in all if this is for a grant in the gitcoin builds gitcoin category I think this is a really good idea.
