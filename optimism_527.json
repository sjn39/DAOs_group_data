However, the article did mention that Optimism had taken a different growth strategy to Arbritrum, by using the OP token. The OP token is great for governance decisions, has value, but I think one of the best things the launch of OP did was create and drive a thriving community of people who were now emotionally invested in Optimism. Whether these people were from one country or another, were builders or not, small holders or whales, etc etc we all had our reasons to be here (again, whether this was for the cool tech, or to make some money, or save some gas fees, or get involved in governance or voting, or support their favourite apps or influencers, again etc etc). What I\u2019m getting at is that the OP token has motivated a whole tribe of people who want to see Optimism succeed. And that this disparate community is an amazing competitive advantage Optimism has in comparison to Arbitrum and other L2s. So what\u2019s my crazy, stupid idea? Why don\u2019t we try and harness this community to drive the success of of protocols and projects on Optimism? BUT get this community to do things other than \u2018buy OP\u2019, \u2018complete this Quest\u2019, \u2018use my app and come back\u2019! Why don\u2019t we have a \u2018Volunteer Tribe\u2019 who can offer time and skills to support Optimism, or more specifically the Protocols and Projects who are Optimism native (or who prioritise Optimism). While the Optimism Ambassadors is a great program, the numbers are too few, the entry level partially high, and ultimately they assist Optimism as a whole, not the individual protocol teams building on Optimism. I was more thinking about volunteers who could help the teams directly. So, can we setup some type of resource where people can list themselves to be part of the Volunteer Tribe (and no, for the record, I don\u2019t care what this list or group of people is called). While maintaining their preferred privacy and anonymity, they could list something like:  Contact details Specialist skills (or even just note that they want unskilled volunteer work) How many hours a week or month they could volunteer Their available times What projects or protocols they are most interested in working with Country or time zone TBD  This resource is meant to be more open than the Ambassadors program, but not quite a full blown jobs board where specific roles must be listed. Rather, it\u2019s meant to work the other way around, where there\u2019s just a pool of human resources that protocols can search or scour to find people to help with odd tasks, routine activities or particular problems where the investment in staff might not be warranted but it would \u2018still be handy to get done\u2019. The resource could be as informal as replies to this Post, or something more formal and complex online. In conclusion: This was just a thought I had when I read the article about Arbitrum taking a lead over Optimism, and I couldn\u2019t shake the idea that we should be using all the people drawn by the OP token to promote or work for the success of Optimism and the apps/protocols that are prioritising this layer 2. I keep thinking, \u201cWe may not all be the most rich and powerful here, but geez there\u2019s a lot of us! There must be some advantage we can draw from this, on behalf of Optimism\u201d. Thanks for your time. I\u2019d be keen to hear your positive thoughts or constructive criticism. And FYI: I will volunteer to monitor this post, and flesh any ideas out, and can volunteer to push this idea along and get it organised if there is some support for it. Kind regards, Axel ",

I highly suggest volunteering your time in the discord to maintain the flow of the server with the proper education for new members who are inbound to Optimism network. Other than that the two cycles of proposed grants currently passing, the rpgf round 2 distribution, and the cohort of anchors from A16z that have started up this week on Optimism are about to have all engines firing at once for the first time. As we watch this flywheel open up in 2023 it makes me feel so very fortunate and grateful to be a part of this network and I will do everything in my power to help build a great product myself on Optimism!

I have just woken up, and I wanted to spend more time (and have more coffee!) before I replied to your comments. But the only thing I did want to say immediately is that the original post was NEVER meant to be a slight against, or show a lack of a appreciation for, the nerds & ambassador program. Personally, I\u2019m not yet much of a Discord user, so I\u2019m not the most familiar with the programs. This unfamiliarity would have been why when I was reading the CoinDesk article my mind didn\u2019t immediately go to the nerds & ambassador program when thinking about possibilities on how to harness the power and talents of the community. So all I\u2019m trying to say is:  I will respond later today when more awake. While I mentioned the Ambassadors program a couple of times in my post, I did so with only little knowledge about it. So please don\u2019t think my Post was about, \u2018Do this because the Ambassadors program doesn\u2019t\u2019. Because my intention wasn\u2019t meant to be about passing judgement on current activities, but more about possibly adding more things.

Axel_T:   What projects or protocols they are most interested in working with    I\u2019ll answer to that.

To respond to your question: My personal interest for silly fun with mass appeal: Apps like Overtime Markets. My personal interest for career development: Apps in the DeFi space. I\u2019ve very much enjoyed using Kwenta and Velodrome since the Quest period. My personal interest based on pure potential for the tech: Voting apps (government and public company applications), Predictive Markets apps (specifically, high impact event predication where my interest is in economic data and TradFi equity markets), non-artistic NFT applications (e.g. supply chain provenance, and asset or registry tokenisation), apps that can introduce a broader user base of corporates and small businesses and link into their existing web2 tech (I\u2019ve heard this described as DeCom, i.e. decentralised commerce), apps that can increase the transparency, accountability, and comparability of financial and sustainability information and reporting, and finally an interest in soul-based tokens and identity/reputation applications.

In conclusion: This was just a thought I had when I read the article about Arbitrum taking a lead over Optimism, and I couldn\u2019t shake the idea that we should be using all the people drawn by the OP token to promote or work for the success of Optimism and the apps/protocols that are prioritising this layer 2. I keep thinking, \u201cWe may not all be the most rich and powerful here, but geez there\u2019s a lot of us! There must be some advantage we can draw from this, on behalf of Optimism\u201d. Thanks for your time. I\u2019d be keen to hear your positive thoughts or constructive criticism. And FYI: I will volunteer to monitor this post, and flesh any ideas out, and can volunteer to push this idea along and get it organised if there is some support for it. Kind regards, Axel   I agree that the idea of a Volunteer Tribe has potential and could be a valuable way to leverage the strengths of the Optimism community to support the success of projects on the network. If implemented effectively, this could be a win-win for both volunteers and projects in the network, helping to build a stronger and more vibrant ecosystem. I appreciate your creative thinking and hope that your idea inspires further discussion and action within the Optimism community. ",
