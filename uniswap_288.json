Users can now earn UNI tokens by being a liquidity provider for one of the following four pools and then submitting these liquidity tokens on this page:  ETH/USDT ETH/USDC ETH/DAI ETH/WBTC  5,000,000 UNI will be allocated per pool to LPs proportional to liquidity, which roughly translates to:  83,333.33 UNI per pool per day 13.5 UNI UNI per pool per block  That being said, we cannot estimate for you how much your rewards will be, you can do so yourself on the UNI pool page.  The following steps need to be made:  Provide liquidity on one of the above pools Head over to this page and \u2018deposit\u2019 your liquidity tokens in the pool you participated in. That\u2019s it, you\u2019ll see your reward estimate and the time the initial reward pool will still be open for. Note: without depositing the liquidity tokens on this page you will not receive UNI, just providing liquidity to one of the pools isn\u2019t enough.

But, again, Uniswap doesn\u2019t censor any listings and it\u2019s up to you to do your research and decide which projects are legitimate and which are not. As for liquidity providing, again this comes with risk and I recommend you to do research to this as well. I don\u2019t know what you mean with real vs fake coins, it simply depends on which smart contract you interact with. Be aware of potential scams. If you need any further support on that matter, then please join Uniswap on Discord. This is simply not the place. Thank you  ",
