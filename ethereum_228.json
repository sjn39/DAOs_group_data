I\u2019ve started a site (ugly - please don\u2019t judge me by the wordpress   ) to see if I can find any interested partners. solutioncells.org I don\u2019t want to accept the \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d that no one wants to spend crypto. I believe they haven\u2019t met the right motivation to do so. ",

I was just in a conversation the other day with an engineer lead who did not fully understand or appreciate the difficulties of new users to crypto. A key question is: what are the basic needs of users of smart contracts and dapps? What properties of public blockchains are attractive to them (hopefully not just the rising asset prices)? How can the first-time user\u2019s experience be made better while preserving those sought-after properties? ",

What tech (or skills my company has) can I use to do the above? Those who don\u2019t know a new tech don\u2019t have ANY basic needs/wants/ etc pertaining to them. They have lived their whole lives perfectly well without.  It\u2019s up to us to figure out what might be cool. Also - I\u2019d drop \u201chose sought-after properties\u201d entirely. I know a lot of blockchain / crypto people hate me for it - but 99.[9 to 18 decimal places]% of non-crypto geeks people don\u2019t give a hoot about the cool stuff we see - and probably are scared of it if they knew. If we want their attention, money, eyeball & brain time\u2026 the only relevant UX question is about their emotions.  ",
