So I am typing this post up to answer as much of that question as I can publicly.  What was the Wall of Love?  Input Back in Gitcoin Grants 4-6, there used to be a \u201ccomment\u201d feature on the grants checkout page, wherein in addition to leaving some funds for each grant, you could leave a comment of encouragement for the grant owner. For Grants round 5-6, there was the ability to prefill these comments with basic messages like  \u201c keep up the great work\u201d \u201c love the mission of your project\u201d \u201c Great Job\u201d \u201c i appreciate you\u201d Custom messages you input.  I can\u2019t find a screenshot of this UI anywhere, so youll all have to just imagine what it looked like.  Output The results of such input from contributor were then displayed on the grant\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d, right above the newsfeed.  Here are a few sample \"Wall of Love\"s  Rotki   Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.13.38 PM1150\u00d7712 99.6 KB   Prysm   Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.14.33 PM850\u00d7860 60.3 KB   WalletConnect   Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.15.04 PM836\u00d7902 73.8 KB   Yearn Finance   Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.16.03 PM844\u00d7904 71.9 KB   Gitcoin Grants Core team fund  (which has since been deactivated post-DAO transition)  Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.19.07 PM814\u00d7874 69.5 KB   Summary As you can see above, the wall of love was a feature that allowed \u201csocial capital\u201d to flow alongside the \u201cfinancial capital\u201d in Gitcoin Grants. Users were prompted to input a message for each grant owner upon checkout, which was used to generate a wall of love on each grant. Most wall of love comments were short prefilled comments, but there was a long tail of comments that were custom and sometimes a bit more thoughtful. If anyone contributing to GitcoinDAO, who has metabase access, wants to see the wall of love for a grant, they can do so here. The wall of love was deprecated due to the churn and turmoil of the Great Bear and Great Reset of 2020. Most of the DAO contributors involved in Gitcoin today were not around for the Wall of Love.
