                    "content": " Project Name: Raptor   Author Name: @netrunner on behalf of Raptor Twitter  Number of OP tokens requested: 800,000  L2 Recipient Address: 0xB1e36fA14cEBC9754A581f92c59675F842513D88  Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) Trading Volume on Uniswap (30d): <$1M. MCap: ~35M. We just launched on Uniswap! (fair launch).  Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): This proposal seeks to realize Optimism\u2019s Vision in supporting public goods such as Validators Nodes which benefits Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. This is why Optimism is Granting 100% of centralized sequencer profits to Ethereum protocol development, because it is a core part of Optimism\u2019s ethos. Raptor is an Ethereum infrastructure DAO focused on maintaining ETH2 Validator Nodes, an essential public good, by supporting the infrastructure to onboard the next wave of users into Web3. We believe the open source roots of Ethereum encourage communities to support each other and support the network. Optimism is a layer 2 chain, meaning it functions on top of the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1), and as such will rely upon this infrastructure once Ethereum 2.0 rolls out. As a Validator we are responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This keeps Ethereum secure for everyone and in return earns ETH. ETH will be used to buy back Optimism Tokens from the open market on an quarterly basis, using 50% of the Ethereum Validator rewards. We believe our project aligns itself with the Optimism ethos that healthy public goods create a thriving and valuable ecosystem.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? We will use the allocation to help fund 10 Ethereum 2.0 Validator Nodes. We are seeking support from other communities to help us grow a network of Validator Nodes funded by the wider Web3 community. We believe this is an important step in ensuring Ethereum stays a truly decentralized network.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? We will buy back Optimism Tokens from the open market on an quarterly basis, using 50% of the Ethereum validator rewards, and use the other 50% to fund more validators. We will verifiably burn the OP tokens and report these activities on a quarterly basis which will be available in our Gitbook. Over time, the process of burning OP Tokens will reduce circulating supply, impacting its value. As the token value increases it will drive more usage and liquidity on Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? As long as the Ethereum network is active, ETH Validator rewards will be ongoing, and used to buyback and burn Optimism tokens. Last year, Ethereum implemented a transaction fee-burning mechanism which removed 1.3 million ETH from the network making ETH a deflationary currency, which will increase in value over time. As ETH appreciates, we will be able to acquire more OP tokens to burn, courtesy of all Ethereum network users. This activity will reduce the OP token supply over time, impacting price and encouraging more users into Optimism.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We don\u2019t. The $OP is being collateralized into a loan that will fund the Validators. We expect these Nodes to be running within 3 months.  How much will your project match in co-incentives? We are seeking funding from other communities, however at the moment we aren\u2019t able to monetarily co-incentivize or we would have already! We believe providing Ethereum Validator Nodes are an essential public good and seek Optimism\u2019s help in achieving this. We look forward to your support. Stay Optimistic!

Your reward for funding structure (i.e. buy back & burn from 50% of Validator Rewards) and the response it has garnered from the community in the replies is so impressive that, as of today, I have mimicked the idea and updated my own Draft Proposal with a similar reward/incentive model.

This proposal seeks to realize Optimism\u2019s Vision in supporting public goods such as Validators Nodes which benefits Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole.

Running nodes isn\u2019t a specialized service and I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re offering. If we approved this proposal would it not set a precedent for anyone who wanted to do the same? If Ethereum was desperately short of validators, and running them was incredibly difficult then this proposal might make more sense as a public good\u2026 but neither are the case. Giving 10 validators to one entity doesn\u2019t even seem like it makes sense from a decentralization maximizing position as it would obviously be better to distribute them to 10 unconnected operators. Please can you expand on why this proposal would make sense? Maybe I\u2019m missing something.

I believe requesting funding to spin up these public goods aligns with Optimism\u2019s Vision. This is why Optimism is Granting 100% of centralized sequencer profits to Ethereum protocol development, because funding public goods is a core part of Optimism\u2019s ethos. In the example you presented, this would make no sense since the Ethereum development team would already have all the funding it required. The reason Optimism is doing that is because it is the right thing to do. I agree with your points that it would make sense for 10 seperate entities to seek funding to run Validator Nodes as it aligns with Optimism\u2019s Vision, but since neither is happening, I am honored to be the first to request funding, and I hope it sets a precedent showing that communities like Optimism that rely on Ethereum are willing to fund public goods that help the network. Also, in regards to your staking pool / rocketpool minipool validator service, it is a very different thing to a full validator node using a dedicated machine and various execution layer clients to prevent a single source of failure for the network. As Ethereum\u2019s own documentation states this is extremely beneficial to the health of the network, and in turn for Optimism. I look forward to your support. ",

I believe requesting funding to spin up such goods aligns with Optimism\u2019s Vision.   My main question though is why would funding you to run multiple validators be a public good in particular? It\u2019s not a specialist skill that requires outsourcing to other people. A quick look on Dune shows that just of the small group of people that own an NFT from the collection used in my profile picture, 53 out of 1056 are solo stakers, and 12 run RocketPool nodes (which still involves running clients etc - Prysm and Nimbus in my case).    dune.com    Dune Blockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community. Explore and share data from Ethereum, xDai, Polygon, Optimism, BSC and Solana for free.      Across the whole Ethereum network there\u2019s currently around 10,746 synced nodes, running 403,108 active validators in total. I don\u2019t think it makes sense for Optimism to give ~$400,000 worth of OP to you in order to bring those numbers to 10,767 and 403,118\u2026 it might be a public good but if so it\u2019s negligibly impactful.

We often think about it in terms of optics (i.e. \u201chow does it look to the world when we\u2019re centralized vs. decentralized?\u201d) but the REAL value of decentralization comes when much of the stake IS centralized. Decentralized validators are the ones who will remain honest an propose slashing against the misdeeds of a centralized staker. Another way to think about it is decentralizing operations - if centralized validators are attacked in a coordinated way (even if by a natural disaster), it may be the few decentralized validators that keep the network humming.\u201d ",

I guess there\u2019s also the slight risk that some people wouldn\u2019t admit to the conflict of interest and wouldn\u2019t mention that they have a validator running, but for the relatively small number of OP we\u2019re talking about issuing I\u2019m not sure this matters\u2026 would anyone risk their reputation for the equivalent of about $150?

However, I am aligned with the feedback from @MinimalGravitas & @OPUser later; although running validators contributes to the network, it is also an individual decision of those interested in this activity. In this case I see two options: Optimism gov as entity in some way contributes to maintaining validators for Ethereum (and in this case Raptor can contribute on this goal) or Raptor join forces with an open and reputable ethereum community so that the use of these validators (and security) is effectively better given, aligning (a little) more to the idea of public goods. Let us know what do you think. By now, our vote is No. ",

This works out being much more than the 324OP calculated previously as that was based on valid beacon chain depositors before filtering out centralised institutions. Due to the low number of actual unique validators This makes the reward on an individual basis quite lucrative and yet does not burden OP supply. This is actually very important, as the main purpose of this proposal (publishing very soon) is the incentives this creates around ETH staking, if this were to go through it will have huge benefits to the decentralisation of ETH staking which in turn benefits OP L2 and is in line with Optimism ethos of public goods and sustainability. This sets a precedent for other L2s and Projects to include validators in distributions (we have seen similar effects on public goods funding via Gitcoin because of similar external incentives) this could turn the tide on centralisation of ETH staking, the additional incentives will be a push for a lot of people to put the extra effort to run solo validators and reduce LIDO/and others impact. This is why it is imperative to reward solo validators and for it to be meaningful, which simply due to the low number of unique validators it works out this way even with a small % allocation. One thing I want to mention, which has been brought up about conflict of interest, both me and @MinimalGravitas run validators, One of the points of my proposal is including node operators in the discussion Validators are not simply service providers like miners, they must own ETH and run the physical layer of the network without which wouldn\u2019t exist. Validators/node operators should have a say in the development of L2, maybe not a large say but should absolutely have some say. ",

Reasons are simple  They want 800k $OP (~$416,000) to market dump for $ETH which they will use to stake in validators. They promise to give 50% of the rewards to buyback $OP. This makes no financial sense as to get back $416,000 from 10 validators you would need at least 25 years assuming constant price of $OP and $ETH and today\u2019s ETH staking APY (4%).

In fact we wont be selling a single $OP. We will be using the $OP in a collateralized loan that will fund these Validators.   This proposal was written through the lens of a grant, not a loan. However, what we can say is that 50% of all Validator rewards are used to buyback and burn $OP tokens indefinitely. It is expected that ETH validator APY will fluctuate in time (especially after the shanghai update) and as the price of ETH increases, the amount of $OP tokens that can be acquired and burned may also increase. While I appreciate you taking the time to try and extrapolate $OP / $ETH calculations, it\u2019s nugatory without taking into consideration all the known and unknown changes expected to impact the price over the next decade let alone the next 25 years. The same can be said in-fact with respect to the $OP token, which has halved in value in the time this proposal has been live. All I can say with confidence is that we can use 50% of all rewards to buyback and burn OP tokens.   Validator clients are built from open-source software, much like Rotki. Decentralized (non-pooled) Validator nodes are public goods that underpin the entire Ethereum network and provide tremendous benefit to all users of the network, including Optimism.   Best of luck with your proposal also. ",

                    "content": "Hi @krzkaczor, thank you for taking the time to review this proposal. Public goods such as validators can be fairly compensated for provided security. Otherwise there would be little incentive to do so. Validator client software is open-sourced and staking is a public good for the Ethereum ecosystem. The Ethereum foundation states that here. Project: Raptor is supporting the network by providing decentralized nodes hosting validators. This is different to staking pools like Lido and Rocketpool. Both are important, however in order to improve decentralization of the network, there should be multiple types of clients and systems to reduce the chance of systemic attack. We believe this modest grant will help signal to other communities that rely on Ethereum, they are willing to support the network. Whether this is through our grant request or through a retroactive airdrop to incentivize/reward validators, that\u2019s for the OP community to decide. In return for this grant, we would use 50% of the validator rewards to buyback and burn OP tokens indefinitely. Team: The core team of Raptor is comprised of talented individuals with backgrounds in crypto, cyber-security, UX, behavior, and gaming. I have a solid reputation online and I am a contributor to other protocols, as explained in an earlier reply here. You can find more information on the team in the Raptor gitbook available in the proposal. In regards to anonymity, I have been part of the crypto \u201cscene\u201d when there was only bitcoin. Well before Ethereum existed and place a high premium on remaining anonymous for obvious reasons. It is interesting to see a new wave of crypto adopters who prefer people doxx themselves and others, both of which have never been on the receiving end of a coordinated hack or a wrench attack. Token amount: The amount requested changed as a result of OP tokens losing half its value within the time this proposal has been live. Token \u201cdump\u201d: Tokens are used as security for a collateralized loan to fund the validators. This means no OP is sold or \u201cdumped\u201d. ",
