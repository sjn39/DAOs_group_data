                    "content": "As a recipient, I cannot complain too much. But as suggested improvements, perhaps also factor in: 1) Number of governance votes cast (either on Snapshot or Agora). I.e. This will reward real, regular governance participants irrespective of their delegated vote size/power. More votes cast (irrespective of voting power) = more impact on Optimism\u2019s future, and thus according to Optimism philosophy should also equal more profits accrued. 2) Number of \u2018completed Quest\u2019 NFTs held. I don\u2019t think this criteria should be overweight, but there should be a reward to testing new apps and possibly onboarding for regular use. Also, by counting this as a criteria it would validate, reassure and show follow-through to many who genuinely believed Quests would be a major influence on AirDrop 2. 3) While it\u2019s clearly stated that, \u201cparticipation in this governance forum will never be used as a criterion for a future airdrop\u201d, there are ways to reward forum participation without attracting spam, low quality posts. I.e. the blanket non-consideration of Forum participation could be a false sybil positive. For example, all of our Forum Profiles list the \u2018number of hours read\u2019 or the \u2018number of hearts received\u2019, etc. Thus we could use high-quality, long term engagement in the Forum as a criteria or marker of positive sum behaviour. EDIT 4) POAPs collected at Community Governance Calls. The number of these POAPs held can be a strong, clear indicator of those who are deeply involved in Optimism Governance. I\u2019ve only been to a couple of these calls, but both times the attendee list was a \u2018whos who\u2019 of Optimism leaders (real, real, real users, builders and ambassadors). Rewarding these POAP holders will inherently reward the OP Community Leaders, but will also incentivise attendance and participation in these meetings. But overall, I was very happy with the Airdrop, and really appreciated it. Including the ease of receipt, i.e. it just showing up in my wallet. This was a great surprise and better than having to run the gauntlet of have to \u2018claim\u2019 on any possibly dodgy website. Final general comment: OP price hasn\u2019t crashed post AirDrop 2, so it looks like more recipients are holding onto their tokens and not just using the airdrop to make a quick buck. ",

This airdrop surprised us all : the timing, the low % distributed and the very (too?) selective criteria. This being said, if the goal of this airdrop was to disinterested the farmers, I believe that it is done! More seriously, here are some ideas :   To reduce the sybills we saw several proposals like the Gitcoin passport, the amount of fee or transactions, the duration of interactions with the different apps etc\u2026 I think it\u2019s a bit excessive. Especially for the passport, which requires doxxing to be valid. Nobody has yet found effective solutions to reduce bots. But use platform like Clique could be a thing.   About the good behaviors that contribute to the community I think you still have to take into account the on-chain data. The number of quests made, the number of transactions over the year, the governance votes\u2026 The goal is to have a wide enough range of eligibility criteria to reward users properly.   I think that making an airdrop too small in terms of amount is not a good thing in the long run. The idea is not to make only airdrop like season 1 but to find a middle ground. May be 2/3% of the supply per bach in order to keep it attractive.   ",

I mean, free $$\u2026 But I understand the perspective of those who completed Quests or performed certain transactions thinking they would qualify. I think the Quests were a novel idea targeting all users to assist in introducing the OP Ecosystem and rewarding users immediately with an NFT.  The NFT part was smart, as it \u201cpaid\u201d out upon completion and incentivized behavior OP found important.  Though it was possible that completing Quests helped you qualify.  Ultimately just be active in the areas that interest you. I liked how transactions on Eth were not part of the eligibility.  As the OP ecosystem grows, many users may not have the need to leave L2, so that part makes total sense. A lot of the issues I am reading may stem from OP\u2019s messaging.  At the time, adding the Quest feature to the website and promoting it in Discord did make it appear very important, which it is.   But Optimism\u2019s style is simple and anything that is created and launched by OP is a big deal.  So when Quests launched only a few months after AD#1, it had an AD eligibility aura that was never put to rest. ",

                    "content": "There were cool mechanics in both airdrops to stop sybil farmers, but some other things are jeopardizing the community. People always look back at how a token was distributed and use that to establish the legitimacy of the different protocols/chains, and with all these gymnastics, some of us are concerned that you might be messing it up. The 2 problems with the mechanics established in the airdrops: 1- Heavily skewed in favor of people already holding OP: Lots of users might not be participating in governance because they did not get airdrop 1, or they simply do not care about it. But, are not these real OP users too, that should have the opportunity/invitation to participate in governance that these airdrops represent? This mechanic is favoring the accounts that already got airdrop 1, or the ones who already have a lot of OP, heavily favoring centralization. This makes no sense. 2- Great disparity in the amounts of OP received per account Even if were not true that not all accounts should have an equal invitation to the governance of the optimism collective (wich is a very debatable assumption in itself), i dont see how its a good idea that, for example, some accounts get airdroped 5000x the governance power over others\u2026 which is exactly what airdrop 2 did. (some users got 1, some selected few 5000x\u2026 most got < 20) I will put this in more practical terms, from my perspective: Im a real user, and optimism is my main chain, and have over 500 txs. I got 80 OP, and I dont understand why some users have gotten 27k OP from the first airdrop, and those same got 5k from this second one now. Why do these people are 400x more valuable than me as a user? I dont think they even use the chain as much as i do. And most casual users from op received even less than me\u2026its obvious they will be mad. The disparity and centralization you are creating from the start is huge. And what its more worrisome is that its done at discretion, without any valid justification for it. I dont know if \u201cfairdrops\u201d are the best, but at least you should be VERY close/striving to it. To have a wide and equal distribution as possible. If, lets say, you gave equal ammounts of OP to users who had meet x criteria, these airdrops would  have been a lot more legitimate. Maybe not a fairdrop, but setting a 2x cap or whatever. I think both airdrops had good intentions from the team, but in reality they are heavily centralizing the collective at discretion, and taking away legitimacy of the project in the process. Maybe its still early to fix the course, but that might imply, for example doing fairdrops from now on and not doing airdrops to any account that already received X ammount of OP\u2026 wich will make OP whales mad. lol.

It\u2019s inspiring to see aggregate behaviors that contribute to the community, and I believe that this airdrop has brought people together in a positive way. Regarding logistics, I believe the size and frequency of the airdrop were ideal. It was a generous reward for those who had already interacted with the Optimism network, and it has served as a great incentive for others to get involved. Overall, I\u2019m extremely satisfied with the Optimism Airdrop #2 and I\u2019m excited to see what future community initiatives will bring.
