We have decided to clear out the main branch of the repository, due to age and the amount of deprecated and no-longer used content. I have created a PR that achieves this, which is linked below.  Removed folders /blogPosts - Contains blog content that has been replicated elsewhere. /contributing - Guides to contributing to this repo, no longer applicable. /faqs - Duplicated in the content folder which remains. /flow-typed - Unused generated code. /grants - Details of no-longer-active grants program + historic audits. /hackathons - Details of no-longer-active hackathon programs. /meetups - Details of no-longer-active meetups programs. /onboarding - Onboarding for vaults and voters, replaced by MOM content. /risk - Collateral Onboarding Guides, no longer applicable. /scd-faqs - SCD FAQ\u2019s no longer relevant. /src - No longer used front-end code. /static - Static content no longer referenced by any front-ends. /translations - Translation guides, no longer applicable.  Remaining folders /governance - Contains actively used governance polls/votes/delegate profiles. /content - Contains introductory content that is not currently live elsewhere.  If you think anything mentioned here might still be in active use by a front-end, or is regularly referenced by you or contributors you know, please get in touch asap. A snapshot of all content prior to clean-up will be accessible on the \u2018prior-cleanup\u2019 branch in perpetuity.    github.com/makerdao/community         DO NOT MERGE YET: Nuked the repo.   makerdao:master \u2190 LongForWisdom:master              opened 03:43PM - 09 Jan 23 UTC                 LongForWisdom               +2 -114054       * Removed out of date content. * Removed publishing-related content. * Removed\u2026 github build actions. * Now just governance stuff + introductory content (also out of date, but best we have)       ",
