Serv.eth Support will provide 24/7* end-user support in the Uniswap Discord server. If they are unable to answer a users question directly they will triage the issue and gather any potentially necessary details, or redirect the user to a more appropriate place to ask their question. Serv.eth Support would monitor all channels except for the foreign language channels and the development channels. *lunch breaks and unexpected catastrophic event may cause small gaps in coverage from time to time. At such time as Uniswap governance acquires USDC or DAI, a new proposal will be submitted that cancels the existing Sablier money stream and replaces it with a 50,000 USDC/DAI per year money stream (pro-rated for remainder of the year). If Serv.eth Support fails to provide the level of service governance feels is worth the asking price, a new proposal will be submitted that cancels the existing Sablier money stream.

Short-sighted selfishness on my part, really. I\u2019d prefer if someone else paid this for me. I see it this way, there are some employees giving support for free. That support probably gives some value to UNI. That\u2019s good. Now those employees suggest that they will move on to other things, but they would be interested in continuing providing this support in exchange of getting (at this moment) ~78k$. I don\u2019t know how much Discord support Uniswap is getting. How many employees are we talking about? Is this service feasible to obtain from someone else for ~20k$? Why or why not? We don\u2019t have a problem with this at the moment. Might be because you are taking care of it, or might be because it\u2019s not such a significant problem. If this becomes a serious problem and price tanks due to unsufficient support, maybe a whale or two will take care of the problem temporarily. A short thought too, is spoonfeeding and giving easy solutions to people who are not willing to read the FAQ or do the barest amount of research good for the token? Why or why not? Maybe not helping incentivizes them to get up and do the research. I\u2019m no marketer so I don\u2019t have much of a clue about these things. ",

Autonomous proposal contract would be created and seeded with the DAI/USDC/ETH.  The autonomous proposal would collect the 10M UNI delegates necessary to create the vote.  The vote would issue the following transactions (in order):  Swap UNI with the autonomous proposal for DAI/USDC/ETH at the rate defined in the proposal. Use the DAI/USDC/ETH to open a Sablier stream.  If the proposal fails to achieve 10,000,000 delegates by some time, the autonomous proposal will allow the investor to cancel the contract and get their DAI/USDC/ETH out. If the proposal fails to pass, the investor will be able to get their DAI/USDC/ETH out. If the proposal passes, the investor will be able to get the UNI out after the proposal executes. It is TBD if an autonomous proposal can attract 10,000,000 delegates or not, even when it is a generally supported proposal, which I suspect is going to be the hardest part.  The problem is that delegates cannot delegate, which means none of the large delegates like Dharma, Gauntlet, Penguin Party, etc. can help reach the 10M minimum necessary.  It would have to be individual UNI holders willing to delegate to an autonomous proposal.  FWIW, if someone wants to put in a lot of engineering work there is a way to trustlessly buy UNI at approximately market rate off of Uniswap.  The problem is that the engineering costs of implementing such a mechanism is likely higher than the entire value of this proposal!  I do think it would be valuable long term, so I think it would be worth doing, but UNI governance first needs to hire some engineers to implement it. ",

                    "content": "A problem still exists with distribution. With this proposal I assume it will be one person putting up the funds and receiving UNI at a discount. The discount incentivizes that one person to sell UNI on the market to receive its return. The proposal requires DAI/USDC/ETH funds are locked up first for the duration of Pre-Proposal/Proposal process. During this time price could swing past that individual investor\u2019s expected return for taking the risk. I believe this proposal will attract short term speculator (i.e. equivalent to a monthly call option); rather than a diverse group of long term supporters. I would vote for this strategy if it did not require a one/few people putting up the funds to start it, and it was more open towards others partaking in the buying of the discounted UNI (i.e. perhaps some sort of DAI/USDC/ETH drip of initial bidders?). It may be a better overall approach to have a proposal for UNI treasury to be sold off everyday to USDC/DAI so there is a fund to pay out for services. This proposal should be general purpose, and will not be directed to an individual project, but will allow sablier USDC/DAI payments for agreed upon service rates in future proposals. ",
