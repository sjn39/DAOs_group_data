                    "content": "This is a recent innovation coming from some of the food token projects, but I think it is worth considering and could have wide implications for MakerDAO and other on-chain governance based projects. The idea is to change governance votes so that instead of just using MKR tokens to vote, you use an AMM Liquidity Provider (LP) token where MKR is one side of the market. Examples of this would be Uniswap and Balancer. This has a few interesting effects on the project:  It provides market liquidity for MKR which is good for holders of the token It makes governance a yield generating asset, which can help offset costs for voting as well as capital opportunity costs. Better aligned incentives between MKR holders and DAI holders It creates some positive feedback loops for the protocol   Improved market liquidity for DAI which helps maintain the peg Improved market liquidity for the protocol to exchange DAI->MKR for burning LPs get extra income from the protocol for providing liquidity  What are the cons?  \u201cImpermanent Loss\u201d risk of being a market maker More expensive to achieve the same voting power since you have to provide DAI liquidity (same relative to everyone else though) Contract risk of the AMM  You\u2019ll notice that the most popular AMMs right now for MKR are MKR/ETH markets. This makes sense in the current environment, but I think for the purpose of the protocol, we would want to create incentives for MKR/DAI markets to get the positive feedback loops. ",

With more liquidity you can get more trade volume, but you also provide incentives to provide assets to the liquidity pool so they offset in terms of velocity. The market will determine the velocity based on other factors. More liquidity in markets gives people more confidence to hold/use both assets because they know the prices of each will be more accurate. ",

There is a lot going on and my apologies to add but I wanted to get this idea off my plate for risk-governance consideration as well as community consideration.  There has been a lot of discussion about attack vectors in the Maker system.  I have in my own analysis identified two primary attack vectors that I outline quickly below.    General governance attack via obtaining sufficient MKR.   The first line of defense for the MCD here that has been recently enacted is \u2026     ",

We want MKR locked up securing the hat, not floating around in the market at high velocity.   I don\u2019t think MKR being more liquid is good. MKR equates to voting rights, and voting rights equates to power, however small a measure. MKR should not be considered in the same class as Dai, or BAT. Those are assets which are intended to be used as a medium of exchange, a currency, and so high velocity for them is a very healthy thing. MKR is a governance token, and if I saw a lot of people trading away a governance token, it would indicate to me that there may be a problem that governance can\u2019t fix, and that I might want to avoid that system.

The advantage of doing this is that in a black swan event, this would theoretically increase the amount of funds recoverable by minting and auctioning new MKR (because the LPs would be effectively posting bids with their LP tokens). Perhaps rewarding users who stake the 70/30 MKR ETH balancer LP token may help with maker\u2019s loss capacity, but the LPs would need to have an unbonding period so they can\u2019t withdraw their money selectively during loss events.
