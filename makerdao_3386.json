Simply, we are looking for volunteers to complete and widely share two surveys. One survey is quite broad and seeks to understand the crypto and fintech ecosystem at large, from novice users all the way to dapp developers. we hope to get tons of responses to this one. The second survey is focused on existing users of Maker products, it will only be relevant to those who use DAI, Vaults (CDPs), or Maker Governance. If you think you can help, please complete the above surveys and share them far and wide! Thank you Jordan ",
