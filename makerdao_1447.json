Multiple new over-collateralized stablecoins will appear, transparent backing collateral metrics will transform the industry and push stablecoins to commodity status. In the future a competitive advantage will no longer only be that a stablecoin performed as a stablecoin, i.e. peg holding. In this world, what competitive advantage or value proposition would differentiate us from the rest. Below are a few options.     Established - Longest running stablecoin Decentralized - No intermediaries, ability to remain anonymous Globalization - Availability in the market via wallet integration, dapps, exchanges, L2s etc Interest - DSR is higher than other stablecoins Real World Integration - Accepted as currency by businesses and payment processors Insurance - Development of on chain deposit insurance similar to FDIC insurance but specific to DAI On-chain trading - On-chain DAI investment options Other - Leave in comments for brainstorming     0 voters     ",
