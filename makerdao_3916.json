As a future delegate, I feel the unit does not have what it takes and will use an illustrative example. In April 2021 the Maker community onboarded the first use of a Real World Asset (RWA) as stablecoin collateral. While the immediate effects are merely local, the wider and long-term implications are enormous.  The potential amount of collateral available for Vaults increasing by a conservative estimate of 61000, with profound long-term implications for the whole of crypto. The event was in other words what you would call noteworthy. This is what a typical real-world marketing department would have done:  planned the event, coordinated with relevant groups official press release splashed it on mainstream and social media across all platforms used hyperbolic language for maximum pump and exposure  Here is what an understated, facts-only marketing department could have done:  planned it - it was months in the making  official blog post as an absolute minimum. It is crypto history unfolding. signaled the event on social media. It is reality, not hype. condensed and packaged information and consequences about the event for their industry and potential users.  Here is what the proposed Strategic Marcomms unit did:  I can find no trace of their activities.  Nothing on twitter Nothing on reddit Nothing on the blog Nothing on Youtube around the time of the event Only a few third-party sites even picked up on the event in the aftermath and they quote Centrifuge as the source. Coindesk published it 22.04 and they used @SebVentures\u2019 tweet as source. For the function of strategic marketing and communications at Maker, the community should ask for and expect a higher level of initiative and proactiveness, especially with this group already being on the foundation payroll for 2 years. I will vote \u201cNo\u201d on the MarComms application. ",

I appreciate the opportunity to address the issues you\u2019ve raised, and I hope it won\u2019t be too late to change your mind. The ratification poll is for a new team. It consists of me and Guy, who have both worked for the foundation, and six other outstanding and experienced professionals. The team members are formed and finalized in May. To me, judging this unit based on the foundation\u2019s marketing activities would be like using the past performance of team A to gauge how well team B will do. At the same time, I do understand a lack of information from the foundation hasn\u2019t helped. That is why the Strategic Marcomms CU has provided  a shared public drive where anyone from the community can examine our plan for promotion. We have also presented our strategy in detail. We have listed types of content we plan to write, including a sample calendar. By sharing our plans in detail, we hope it provides a clear picture to the community of what we are ready to do. It is all part of our preparation to execute once we have the mandate. The issues you have highlighted are precisely the reasons why this unit is needed. Without the mandate given by the Maker governance community, we won\u2019t be able to act on any of our plans. I hope this post provides more information about our unit and I sincerely ask you to reconsider your vote. ",

You\u2019ve rightfully pointed out that a number of markets are indicated as high priority. One way to look at it is markets where we identify different sets of opportunities* for MakerDAO. Having identifying the key markets, focusing on specific demographics or audiences will come in nearly every decision we make, including ads we run, campaigns we conduct, budgets we allocate, and partners we collaborate. As importantly, we hope that once we have the mandate, we will gain access to the data from the foundation. That\u2019d help us confirm our analysis and approach and enable us to execute our strategy effectively. @HBJ, a marketing expert in charge of our strategy, will share more details on our approach. *Note: We have put together a document that goes more in detail on the analysis and approaches for opportunities in some major regions. That is important because the approach for high-growth markets would be drastically different from that of a more mature market. ",

I am a member of the team that has worked on the action plan to set up the Strategic Marcomms CU and would like to take a moment to reply to the issues you have addressed. This is a new team that did not exist before and that we felt was needed in the MakerDAO universe, exactly for the reasons you mentioned. This team is made up of people who have worked for the Foundation and other experienced professionals. One thing that I would like to stress is that we are not a re-engineering of the Foundation\u2019s marketing team nor an iteration. You rightly pointed out that when something epochal such as the Maker community use of a Real World Asset (RWA) as stablecoin collateral in April 2021, a first of its kind, there was little hype around it. That can be explained because a) there was not a PR/Marketing team b) there were legal constraints in what the Foundation could announce. You cannot really put fault on a group that did not exist for what was not done. In order to overcome these problems we have proposed a team, the Strategic Marcomms CU, that can take advantage of these and other opportunities (such as the Optimism Bridge) to promote the MakerDAO ecosystem. The world of crypto is still in its infancy and the legal framework in which it operates is still very patchy and uncertain and that put some constraints on what the Foundation could do, or announce. As we will not be part of the Foundation, we will have more operating freedom. As for your assertion that the team has been on the foundation payroll for two years, I would like to differ. Some individuals were part of, or working with, the Foundation in different roles with different mandates, but the team as a whole is mostly made up of external people, such as myself, who were not on the Foundation\u2019s payroll. I hope that in the light of this new information you will reconsider your position and change your vote to a \u201cyes.\u201d ",

I want to reiterate that our proposed CU is determined to become the marketing unit for MakerDAO because we keenly feel the need to market important happenings of the community such as the RWA. That is why we decided to spend several months working on this proposal and building our team. Every team member at the Strategic Marcomms CU reflects MakerDAO\u2019s values of marketing, innovation and resourcefulness. We love to see the entire cryptocurrency community grow to become stronger. We want MakerDAO to play a key role. Many of us have been ardently supporting MakerDAO for several years, our efforts have been driven by industry-wide passion to see MakerDAO succeed. Having this CU as part of the community will only energize and usher us into exhibiting the best we can to better achieve our vision for MakerDAO. Moreover, looking at our strategy will only make you realize the good plans we have pen down to offer the most succulent promotion needed for MakerDAO growth. Voting us in, is the fuel to spark this engine of zealous marketing the community expects to see. The DAO marketing unit can aggrandize marketing for MakerDAO that the foundation simply couldn\u2019t because of legal constraints. Ever since we started working on this proposal, we have never taken the community\u2019s contributions for granted, not for one minute. Our team takes the community seriously, as a way of coming together across lines of difference to confront and solve problems, build ideas, and expand opportunity. We expect a lot, too. It will be a tremendous honor to work to live up to it when we have the mandate. Thanks! ",

The gaps which you have highlighted on what marketing could and should do more are exactly what our Strategic Marcomms Core Unit are set up to address. I wouldn\u2019t elaborate more about the limitations faced by the previous team within the foundation environment which my teammates have explained in the above responses. (And just to clarify, I\u2019m not from the foundation.) I like to highlight a slide from our proposal which will give you an insight into our approach on amplifying any new development or deal done by the Maker community or CU. For your reference:  Screenshot 2021-07-16 at 12.25.27 AM1634\u00d7968 157 KB  As seen in the above screenshot example, we have put in place a framework which is designed to amplify and create maximum awareness and exposure for Maker. Depending on the announcements or the deals, the specific details in each step will change but the overall logic flow will remain. I hope that gives you a clearer view of our team\u2019s thinking towards marketing. Last but not least, I just want to say that within this proposed Strategic Marcomms CU, we have a team of highly experienced, well-qualified, dedicated and passionate professionals who are raring to take Maker to the next level. I sincerely hope you will reconsider your vote and change it to a 'YES\". ",
