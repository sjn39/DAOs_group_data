At the current $489M exposure, this represents $7.34M of annual revenues. Although there is no indication that GUSD is under any specific risk (as explained by the Gemini team on the forums, on their blog, and on the Gemini Trust Center page), community members have expressed concerns over recent news surrounding the exchange business and have expressed a desire to rotate Maker\u2019s exposure out of GUSD altogether. In order to execute this as seamlessly as possible, MakerDAO would benefit from setting its PSM tout parameter to 0. Poll 1 Do you support this parameter change, which along with the possibility for a third-party to use the PSM permissionlessly, as intended, may result in GUSD exposure being unwound completely?  Yes No Abstain  Poll 2 The PSM-GUSD-A debt ceiling is currently set to 500M. Should the debt ceiling parameter also be changed? If so, what should it be changed to?  It should not be changed 100M 0M  ",

Would anyone care to share further comments/discussion on the benefits and downsides of setting the tout to 0 in that case? For reference, we submitted the following comments with our vote: We support maintaining the Gemini relationship, but reducing exposure meaningfully. The most important risk to manage urgently is MakerDAO\u2019s own capacity to engage expertly with \u201cReal World\u201d counterparties and manage those relationships and their risks extremely well. If from a human resources perspective this can\u2019t be done in a timely fashion, there is too much risk on the table to continue. We consider that market confidence and reputation/trust deterioration in Gemini are as important as triggers for the worst case scenario as are poor legal structures, potential regulatory violations (SEC allegations and penalties sought are VERY serious) and what collateral is where backing GUSD. Speaking of reputation, we think maintaining the PSM at this difficult time may provide some relief to those who are victims of the contagion and this is a role MakerDAO should be proud to serve. Accordingly, we should go to some lengths to preserve what could still be a positive outcome for MakerDAO and ALL as originally hoped IF we can manage the situation well. Continuing with good outcomes, however, requires resources engaged to do the difficult substantive work. We have this invitation from Tyler today:    GUSD & MakerDAO Partnership Update   We are also happy to consider implementing additional processes for increased transparency (e.g., regular meetings with core teams, joining community calls, and other mechanisms to promote transparency and provide needed information) if the community would find it valuable.   Let\u2019s do it. ",

My goal was to highlight all entities that had strong associations with the market maker. If MakerDAO considers Parafi well respected, then that is good.  The really concerning connection to the market maker is Genesis Trading.  If Genesis Trading potentially played a role with the GUSD PSM proposal, this should ring alarm bells.  MakerDAO should be aware that executives of Genesis trading were trying to raise $500M just one month prior to\u2026     The summary is: the entity that filled the GUSD PSM has transactions with Genesis Trading. Executives at Genesis trading were trying to raise $500M one month prior to the first announcement from Gemini to increase the GUSD PSM to $500M. The Genesis Trading potential association with this deal should be examined thoroughly, to ensure there aren\u2019t additional unknown risks to MakerDAO. ",
