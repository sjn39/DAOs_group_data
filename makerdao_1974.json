In practice the Scope Frameworks will be implemented as 12 separate stand-alone MIPs.  The formatting draft does not represent the final result or the terms or parameters that will be relevant for counterparties of Maker Core such as MetaDAOs or Ecosystem Actors  All community members, but in particular those with relevant specialized skills, are invited to provide feedback, clarifications, simplifications and useful changes to the language, structure or formatting of this document  Currently, Scope Framework MIPs are split into 3 components: The Scope Framework Content component (replaces MIPs that deal with processes and procedures in the DAO related to the focus area of the Scope), the Budget component (Replaces the Core Unit MIP structure related to the focus area of the Scope), and the Future Implementation component (Replaces the role of the Declaration of Intent MIP related to the focus area of the Scope)   Real World Asset Collateral Scope Framework Article 1: Constitutional boundaries on the Scope Framework  Section 1.1: The RWA Collateral Scope Framework covers processes and parameters for making proposals managing native PSMs and Protector Lines of Credit Types  Article 2: The RWA Council   Section 1: The RWA Council proposes updates to the Scope Framework  Section 2: The RWA Council initiates proposals and governance action based on articles defined in the RWA Collateral Scope Framework   Clause 1: The RWA Council has fast track proposal priviliges that allows them to submit votes directly to the weekly governance cycle or directly as executive votes if they relate to Section 2.2    Section 3: The RWA Council is responsible for searching for suitable candidates for RWA Core Units, and when a RWA Core Unit is in the place it will take over the responsibilities described in Article 2 Section 2   Section 4: The RWA Council must report all of their work on the forum, and later transition to using a unified coordination toolkit  Note: The below article is currently a visual placeholder, it will need to be fundamentally replaced with a new article that achieves the objectives of a \u201cMaker SubDAO (Protector) Line of Credit type A\u201d Article Article 3: Maker SubDAO (Protector) Line of Credit type A   Section 1: Allowed asset allocation: USD Government Bond financial products with liquidity profile of (min 50% 3 month, 25% 1 year etc), with a maximum of 30% allocated into mortgage backed ABS produts with credit enhancement of at least 15%, max variation etc. If a Protector is in breach of these requirements for more than a week, then the RWA Council must propose a penalty of 200,000 Dai taken directly from their surplus buffer  Section 2: Maker Core loss to market value at liquidation: up to 50% can be withdrawn at a slippage of maximum 3%, up to 100% can be withdrawn with a slippage of up to 10%.

Given that we will almost always be viewing the doc via an html frontend (and that we\u2019ll have editors to fix up mis-formatted documents), this doesn\u2019t feel like a huge issue. Alternatively, the required tags could be added via a pre-process pass on the frontend (this is trivial because the information denoting level is already present in the dot syntax).

                    "content": "On language I\u2019m assuming that the main goal of these is clarity and unambiguity. This seems implied by everything I\u2019ve heard so far, but please correct if I\u2019m misunderstanding.    The RWA Council is responsible for searching for suitable candidates for RWA Core Units, and when a RWA Core Unit is in the place it will take over the responsibilities described in Article 2 Section 2  The council is responsible for searching for candidates, but not for taking actions that increase the likelihood of suitable candidates being onboarded. A malicious, lazy or overworked council could find appropriate entities, list them publicly, and wash their hands of the affair. This would be better stated as the combination of:   It is the RWA\u2019s Council\u2019s responsibility to identify and onboard suitable candidates as RWA Core Units. If no RWA Core Unit exists, the RWA Council has fast track privileges to\u2026 If one or more RWA Core Unit\u2019s exists, each RWA Core Unit may independently use fast track privileges to\u2026   (actual wording would obviously vary depending on exactly how privileges + onboarded work, etc). Advice there can mainly be summarized as  Avoid statements that state more than one thing, this leads to ambiguity and lack of specificity. Ensure that what you\u2019re writing is what you actually want. \u2018Searching\u2019 for a set of contributors is not \u2018Ensuring that suitable contributors are onboarded effectively\u2019, I suspect you want the latter, but obviously I\u2019m not you, so maybe someone else is doing this.     The RWA Council must report all of their work on the forum, and later transition to using a unified coordination toolkit  When? How? What counts as a Unified Coordination Toolkit? I understand this sounds ridiculously pedantic, but my understanding is that the goal is that these documents strictly limit the behaviour of otherwise profit-maximizing entities over the long term. If that\u2019s the case, they need to be as bullet-proof as possible. Even the Councils are likely going to be (partially) made up of representatives from these entities, so statements involving them must also be bulletproof.   The RWA Council must report all of their work on the platform designated as the \u201cScope Communication Platform\u201d within 7 days of the work taking place. The \u201cScope Communication Platform\u201d is defined by (entity or MIP).   This is neater and explicitly references an external entity or group that defines the Scope Communication Platform. In that document (I would recommend a MIP for this) You explicitly say:  The \u201cScope Communication Platform\u201d is currently defined as the MakerDAO official forum (chosen by x group). The \u201cScope Communication Platform\u201d will change to the platform designated the Unified Coordination Toolkit as soon as it is confirmed as usable for this function.  The above is essentially an example of the Single Responsibility Principle as its used in a technical context. The scope for RWA is not responsible for the Unified Coordination Toolkit, it just needs to have a clear and simple interface that informs the DAO how work should be communicated. This would mean that once the UCT is complete, you can modify one MIP rather than all 12 scopes.    Jurisdiction requirements: US, Canada, EU, UK, AUS, NZ, Japan  Probably avoid phrasing these badly to save space. This should probably explictly be:  \u201cReal World Assets of this type must be based in one of the following jurisdictions: US, Canada, EU, UK, AUS, NZ, Japan\u201d  (Also weird exceptions to this? Gibraltar? British Virgin Islands, etc?)    The split between the Line Of Credit type A of each ProtectorDAO is 50/50  Between who? This must be as specific as possible.    The RWA Council must propose a new split between the Lines Of Credit of each ProtectorDAO every quarter, based on realized returns.  So they must propose, but don\u2019t need to see it pass? What are you actually trying to achieve here? That the Council is responsible for ensuring that the split meets some goal? They can\u2019t strictly speaking do that because governance has the power to deny the scope changes. So the best you can do is make them responsible for proposing changes (once per month?) until a new split is accepted? Like, you need to word this stuff so that it accurately represents what you want and need to happen. I am uncertain that that does this as written, because making the Council propose a split once a quarter doesn\u2019t guarantee any changes to the split. It kind of sounds like the Council is supposed to negotiate the split between MakerCore governance and ProtectorDAOs on an ongoing basis?       rune:    Section 2: If less than 25% of total Dai Supply is in stablecoins  Section 3: All PSMs can grow to infinitely high debt ceiling with an IAM with the following parameters  Clause 1: The IAM Gap is: x  Clause 2: The IAM Line is: y etc.  Section 4: Base Psms must contain at least 5% of the total Dai supply **Clause 1:**The implied share of an income PSM must take into accou    This section as written is dangerously ambiguous. It\u2019s unclear whether the statement \u201cIf less than 25% of total Dai Supply is in stablecoins\u201d refers to Section 3 or 4. This radically changes the requirements depending on interpretation. In this case I would suggest either:  All statements that Section 2 applies to are made direct children of Section 2. The if-statement is included in every statement explicitly, so:  If less than 25% of etc\u2026 then all PSMs can grow to\u2026 If less than 25% of etc\u2026 the base PSMs must contain at least 5% of\u2026      Veering off from language a bit at this point. Sorry!     rune:  Section 5: The split between GUSD and USDP is 50/50   Clause 1: If an Income PSM exceeds its split and implied base PSM split, for more than 1 week, the RWA Collateral council must propose a winddown of the PSM    This section demonstrates a dichotomy that I don\u2019t think has been well addressed. Namely, are these documents meant to constrain MakerCore, MetaDAOs, Councils and Tribunals or all or some of the above?  Currently it looks like they constrain MetaDAOs, Councils and Tribunals, which makes sense. However, you\u2019re including logic that was presented in the endgame plan as \u2018binding on MakerCore\u2019 (the relationship between collateral assets under various stances) as something that must be proposed by Councils but could be ignored by governance.  I understand that at the lowest level, MakerCore cannot be bound to anything, but my understanding was that you wanted stronger constraints on governance in the future. You could achieve this by empowering permissionless IAMs according to rules governance has ratified. Like, fundamentally, you can\u2019t control the position of MKR holders because ownership of the token is liquid, no matter how much alignment work you do, you can\u2019t guarantee it. More or less the best way you can ensure that governance is bound to these requirements in individual cases is by making them immutable policies (via smart contract) with timelocks to make changes. Obviously that\u2019s more work, but I\u2019m not sure the scope framework saying \u2018group will propose this\u2019 is enough of a guarantee that a pre-agreed policy is actually executed in any given case. Either the Council should be able to do it themselves, or anyone should be able to to enforce it via IAM. ",

                    "content": " High-level comments  MakerDAO and Dai rely on the requirements of the collateral to be liquid and reliable. The PSM (Technical RWA) The collateral in the PSM (which is a lot) is based on centralized stablecoins. This gives MakerDAO a counterparty risk that is not present in decentralize collateral like Ether. The value of the centralized stablecoins can vanish over night. This for instance is the case, if Circle decides to freeze all USDC allocated in MakerDAOs PSM address. After hours of research, I am still not able to identify the underlying assessment of how big a part of Dai\u2019s fundamental building blocks the stakeholders of MakerDAO are comfortable having allocated in centralized stablecoins. With the current allocation, the US government is currently able to rug pull MakerDAO if they want to. As I understand it, the PSM is using its own type of vault because there is no price feed dictating how many Dai one USDC is worth. This assumption has been hardcoded to 1. Ideally 1 Dai = 1 USDC. And Ideally 1 USDC = 1 USD. This is MakerDAOs definition, when measuring if Dai is collateralized as expected. In a scenario where USDC is not worth 1 USD, the protocol will not catch this on time, human beings have to intervene, votes have to be cast, etc. If you compare the PSM vault to an Ether vault, there is no representation of the actual market value when it comes to USDC. The Maker protocol will not know it before it is too late if Circle faces a Terra-scenario. I hope this RWA scope framework can be used to force the facilitation of some of the discussions and risk assessments the Dai and MKR holders deserve. We should start asking ourselves  What is the right level of collateral in the PSM compared to the risk level? What are the arguments for sticking to hardcoding the price of Dai/USDC? What are the risks associated with lending the PSM collateral to third parties?  I suggest making these risk assessments easily identifiable on the new frontends. When you say it can be found on the forum, I say that is not always good enough. I hope this restructuring of the DAO can help enhance external communication. Only being able to observe MakerDAO from the outside, I give the DAO the benefit of the doubt and expect the internal communication is better. Now to (physical) RWA: If the demand for Dai goes up, more collateral is needed to keep the peg to the dollar peg. Diversification to other types of collateral is great for spreading RWA-specific risk and hopefully achieving a lower level of average volatility. However, physical RWA comes with some different characteristics, we have to accept and adjust to the best way possible. It is less liquid and it becomes much harder for the individual MKR or Dai holder to view for themselves if the collateral is reliable. So, as I see it, it is important to make sure the risk tolerance is defined properly to make sure the risk associated with each type of collateral at all times fits the size and type of collateral. I have seen Maker be extremely good at this when it comes to decentralized collateral, for instance by capping the size of the vaults properly. Well, so far it seems like there is a trend of other ERC20 tokens being correlated to the Ether price and with increased volatility. Maker is used to operating in a comfort zone where code is law. Now Maker takes a step moving out of that comfort zone, when operating with RWA, law is law. This has to be combined with MakerDAOs opportunities as a decentralized protocol. Combining the two \u201clegal systems\u201d is quite a challenge. What are the opportunities for instance to claw back a loan, if it defaults outside the sphere we until now have managed with smart contracts. If MakerDAO dares to rely on the pillar of RWA and with that, the traditional legal system, it needs to get reasonable policies, procedures and guides and risk mitigation with great inspiration from TradFi. This formula will hopefully work just fine.  Nitty gritty comments  With my suggestions below, I hope to help adabt some of the principles from risk management in TradFi to the RWA scope framework. Some of it might fit (better) into the constitution. Real World Asset Collateral Scope Framework Comment: Abbreviations and definitions could be implemented in each scope framework to reduce the risk of misunderstanding anything at the same time it may benefit the competition when new clusters or ecosystem actors consider joining. It could look something like this: 1. Abbreviations  RWA; IAM; PSM; ALM;  2. Definitions   SubDao means  Protector Lines means  Credit types means  Price Stability Module means  Real World Assets means  Fast track means  Council votes means  Council executive votes means  Suitable candidates for RWA CUs means  ProtectorDAO means  Maker Core means      rune:  Article 1: Constitutional boundaries on the Scope Framework  Section 1.1: The RWA Collateral Scope Framework covers processes and parameters for making proposals managing native PSMs and Protector Lines of Credit Types    Comment: I suggest constitutional boundaries to be stated in the constitution itself. As I understand it, adding it to the scope framework gives the Council and DVCs the power to easily change it. 3. The RWA Council 3.1 The RWA Council consists of the a, b, c. 3.2 The RWA Council members are appointed and removed by the recognized RWA DVC. Comment: To keep them in check.     rune:  The RWA Council proposes updates to the Scope Framework   Comment: I suggest defining how often it should be assessed by the council if the scope framework should be updated.  This could be based on time, lets say 1 month before the quarterly DVC meeting and based on action: if the circumstances requires it. I also suggest requiring the Council\u2019s written argumentation on why the scope framework should or should not be updated. Finally, the updates should be made with a predetermined notice period, so all stakeholders gets time to prepare for the upcoming DVC call.     rune:  The RWA Council initiates proposals and governance action based on articles defined in the RWA Collateral Scope Framework   Comment: I suggest defining how often it should be proposed by the council/CU. Again, time and action based. I also suggest the Council\u2019s/CU\u2019s written argumentation of why the proposal or governance action was initiated/not initiated. Finally, the proposals and governance actions should be addressed with a predetermined notice period (if time allows it), so all stakeholders gets time to properly prepare.     rune:  The RWA Council is responsible for searching for suitable candidates for RWA Core Units, and when a RWA Core Unit is in the place it will take over the responsibilities described in Article 2 Section 2   Should be changed to: The RWA Council is responsible for hiering and dismissing the contributors for RWA Core Units, and when\u2026     rune:  The RWA Council must report all of their work on the forum, and later transition to using a unified coordination toolkit   Should be changed to: The RWA Council and the RWA Core Units must\u2026 Comment: I love the specification on communication. I suggest it states requirements for frequency and level of detail. This could maybe be applied more generally as an individual article, e.g. something like: \u201cThe council is responsible for defining the requirements for reporting from Protector MetaDAOs in relation to work in scope, work in progress and work done.\u201d I suggest adding the following two sections to the same article: Section x: The RWA Council is responsible for hiring and dismissing an independent risk expert as a second line of defense Section x: Every year in Q1 the Council must submit a report on the forum on how the control framework, risk management, and reporting accuracy and transparency related to RWA can be enhanced. This report must be prepared by an external expert of group of experts, for instance, one of the bit 5 accounting firms. 5: Protectors 5.1 No protector is allowed to have work done from a person or group of persons who is also working on the other side of the deal. If a Protector is in  breach of this requirement, then the RWA Council must propose a penalty of 100,000 Dai taken directly from their surplus buffer. The RWA Council is not limited to  make the proposal only once.     rune:  Article 3: Maker SubDAO (Protector) Line of Credit type A   I suggest to initially in this article add the following four sections: x.1 The principles for assets being allowed for collateral allocation are TBD. x.2 The description and details of assets being allowed for collateral allocation must fit a collateral onboarding framework provided by the RWA Council and the Protectors in collaboration. The RWA Council have the last word in case of disagreement. x.3 The purpose for how a loan can be spent must be reviewed and accepted by the RWA Council and the risk expert before it is deemed valid. x.4 Deals being done must be published on the forum within the boundaries of the collateral onboarding framework. Comment: The risk can quickly gets out of control if we do not manage the different RWA collateral types in a structured and comparable way. This is my reasoning for requiring the collateral onboarding framework.     rune:  Jurisdiction requirements: US, Canada, EU, UK, AUS, NZ, Japan   I suggest the following changes: To ensure RWA collateral is only established in jurisdictions with a legal system recognized by the Council, the following jurisdictions are allowed\u2026     rune:    Section 5: Cost of Capital: carry with benchmark based on nominal yields. 10% carry below the benchmark, 30% carry above the benchmark. Benchmark is (US Treasury 3 month bonds - 0.3%).  Section 6: The split between the Line Of Credit type A of each ProtectorDAO is 50/50    Comment: We should add the reasoning, for making it easier for the Council to propose changes and updates.     rune:  The RWA Council must propose a new split between the Lines Of Credit of each ProtectorDAO every quarter, based on realized returns.   I suggest the following change: The RWA Council must propose a new split between the Lines of Credit of each ProtectorDAO four weeks before the quarterly DVC meeting, based on realized returns. The Council must list its arguments for and against the proposal.     rune:  Article 4: Maker Core Native PSMs and ALM implementation   Question: Changes in the PSMs can have a huge effect on the risk/opportunity. What scope controlls changes in the PSMs, and how are the two scopes intertwined? Suggestion: I suggest adding this initial section to the article: The criteria for making a PSM native are TBD Comment: In this article, several sections have specific numbers listed. I suggest we list the process behind getting to these numbers. If the Council is supposed to suggest changing this, the underlying circumstances might be relevant to take into account.     rune:  Clause 1: If an Income PSM exceeds its split and implied base PSM split, for more than 1 week, the RWA Collateral council must propose a winddown of the PSM   I suggest adding the following to this clause: \u2026 including a time schedule. The arguments for and against the proposal must be stated. Finally I suggest adding the following 4 articles on risk management: Article x: Risk rating x.1: The RWA Council must acquire and maintain a credit scoring model build on quantitative input. Clause 1: The model must define all assets included or to be included. Clause 2: The model must define the credit risk associated with each asset including collateral risk, and counterparty risk. For banks e.g. the typical bankruptcy risk of an entity (Probability of Default) combined with the quality of the collateral (Loss Given Default/Recovery Rate). For Liquid investments aspects of mark-to-market (market risk, liquidity risk, etc.) to make sure the quality of the credit is assessed over time. (Credit transition risk). x.2: The credit scoring for each asset must be reported on the forum every quarter or sooner. If an arranger receives any indication that the value of the asset is fluctuating more than x% since the risk was last reported, an update must be reported immediately. Article x: Risk management, surplus buffer and reporting on PSMs x.1: The RWA Core Unit shall have in place an effective risk-management system for PSMs as their control framework comprising strategies, processes, and reporting procedures necessary to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report, on a continuous basis the risk, at an individual and at an aggregated level, to which they are or could be exposed, and their interdependencies. x.2 The risk-management system shall cover at least the following areas: a) Price data and oracles; b) asset-liability management; c) (re)investment of collateral; d) liquidity and concentration risk management; e) operational risk management; f) The risk of seizure of the assets - current and future x.3: The purpose of having the surplus buffer for PSMs is to TBD x.4: The surplus buffer for PSMs must at all times cover TBD x.5: The procedures and requirements for adjusting the surplus buffer for PSMs are TBD x.6: The RWA Council in collaboration with the RWA Core Unit shall document compliance with the PSM risk management on all frontends. Article x: Risk management, surplus buffer and reporting on physical RWA x.1: All Protectors shall have in place an effective risk-management system as their control framework comprising strategies, processes, and reporting procedures necessary to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report, on a continuous basis the risk, at an individual and at an aggregated level, to which they are or could be exposed, and their interdependencies. x.2 That risk-management system shall be effective and well integrated into the organizational structure and in the decisionmaking processes of the Protectors undertaking with proper consideration of the persons who effectively run the undertaking or have other key functions e.g. like Arrangers, etc. x.3 The risk-management system shall cover at least the following areas: a) underwriting and reserving; b) asset-liability management; c) investment; d) liquidity and concentration risk management; e) operational risk management; f) Allocation to the surplus buffer, reinsurance and other risk-mitigating techniques; g) the process of capital allocation to RWA collateral; h) The risk of seizure of the assets - current and future; i) Ease of ownership enforcement. x.4: The Protector must immediately inform the Council and the recognized RWA DVC about any circumstances that are of crucial importance for the Protectors continuing operations. x.5: The purpose of having the surplus buffer on physical RWA is to TBD. x.6: The surplus buffer for physical RWA must at all times cover TBD. x.7: The procedures and requirements for adjusting the surplus buffer for physical RWA are TBD. x.8: Protectors shall document compliance with this scope on their frontend. x.9: The Protectors shall develop and maintain a visualization of the RWA collateral as comparable to Daistats.com as possible. Article x: Requirements of arrangers x.1: Arrangers are not allowed to personally enter into any agreement regarding the RWA collateral they are responsible for allocating. x.2: Arrangers are not allowed to let a third party enter into an agreement regarding the collateral they are responsible for allocating when the arranger has a personal interest contradictory to Maker Core.

The point is one can set up an LLC in which its operating agreement states that its member interest(s) shall be recognized by a crypto token, that token is put in a Maker vault, and when whatever triggers a default so triggers it, a sale of the token in the vault would sell/transfer whatever portion of the LLC\u2019s ownership the token represents.  No complex trust/trustee needed, at least for the aspect of triggering liquidation.  If a bankruptcy occurs before liquidation, Nebraska law and thus the bankruptcy court would recognize Maker\u2019s perfected security interest in the member interest of the LLC. ",
