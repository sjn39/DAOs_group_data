                    "content": " MIP59: DssCharter  Preamble MIP#: 59 Title: DssCharther Author(s): Tal Baneth (@talbaneth) Contributors: Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut), Derek Flossman (@Derek)  Tags: technical, module, smart-contracts Type: Technical Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2021-08-24 Date Ratified: 2021-10-25 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a License: AGPL3+   References  The proposed dss-charter implementation. The Forum post.   Sentence Summary This proposal provides a smart contract implementation of DssCharter, a module which supports institutional and long term vaults.  Paragraph Summary DssCharter interfaces with the dss core contracts to support creating institutional and long term vaults with debt origination fees. It also includes enforcement of a debt ceiling and a minimal collateralization ratio when drawing debt or withdrawing collateral. For institutional vaults (permissioned mode) the fee percentage and the enforcement parameters are set per vault instance. For long term vaults (non-permissioned mode) these parameters are set per collateral type.  Component Summary MIP59c1: Definitions: defines the parameters used for creating permissioned and non-permissioned vault types. MIP59c2: Proposed code: contains a summary of the proposed implementation. MIP59c3: Test Summary: contains a summary of the existing tests. MIP59c4: Security considerations: comments on the limited nature of the security implications of adding DssCharter. MIP59c5: Licensing: states the license under which the proposal and code are distributed.  Motivation The goal of DssCharter is to boost dai supply by attracting partners and individuals with fixed and sometimes favorable rates, and in return charge origination fees. This setting should incentivise a longer term borrowing commitment.  Specification  MIP59c1: Definitions   gate: Whether the ilk (collateral type) is permissioned. Permissioned ilks are used for institutional vaults while non-permissioned ilks are used for long term vaults.  Nib : Per ilk relative origination fee (for non-permissioned ilks).  nib : Per vault relative origination fee (for permissioned ilks).  Peace: Minimal collateralization ratio upon drawing debt or withdrawing collateral (for vaults in non-permissioned ilks).  peace: Per vault minimal collateralization ratio upon drawing debt or withdrawing collateral (for vaults in permissioned ilks).  uline : Per vault debt ceiling (for permissioned ilks).   MIP59c2: Proposed code See CharterManager.sol. Vault creation and modification are performed through the CharterManager contract, which wraps the Vat and the GemJoin adapter. It includes the origination fee collection (which it immediately moves to the Vow) and other proprietary validations. Similarly to the CropJoin design, CharterManager creates proxy accounts for each user, while making sure only these accounts can hold the specific ilk\u2019s gem and draw debt. Most of the new functionality mentioned above resides in the frob() function, which wraps the Vat\u2019s frob(). This includes fetching the user\u2019s proxy account through getOrCreateProxy(), charging origination fees through draw() and adding validations on any drawn debt through validate(). As in CropJoin, liquidations can only be done by users who create a proxy through CharterManager. To support that, the ProxyManagerClipper should be used.  MIP59c3: Test Summary See CharterManager-unit.t.sol and ProxyManagerClipper-integration.t.sol. The tests cover different configurations of the parameters from the Definitions section and simulation of different scenarios. This includes liquidations, invalid configuration testing and bad actors operations. Mainnet fork testing is also done to simulate against real world conditions.  MIP59c4: Security considerations Since CharterManager wraps the core components of the dss system and does not interact with the Vat in an authorized manner it can not directly cause bad debt / solvency issues. Moreover, the logic for interacting with the GemJoin adapter and the Vat is limited in scope and is purposely reduced to necessity.  MIP59c5: Licensing  AGPL3+  ",
