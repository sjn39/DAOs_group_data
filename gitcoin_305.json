                    "content": " Gitcoin Visual Language This is the third topic in a new series on Gitcoin\u2019s evolving brand strategy. Our visual brand identity is evolving as part of a larger reflection of our transition from an Impact DAO to a Protocol DAO, which we\u2019re announcing at ETHDenver. Process As a values-led design team, we\u2019ve been working to mindfully create concepts and ideas that are meaningful. This work is rooted in our Brand Values, and evolved in parallel with the brand strategy. For a refresh on the preceding work, watch our December Community Call and follow along with our presentation. Outcome Our design team has been hard at work producing visual assets and ideas to support the brand strategy that many of you contributed to and led by Alexa. The design work being shared today is one part of this larger brand evolution process. The work is designed to shine a light on the larger function of Gitcoin, as well as reflect light on you as a contributor or community member.  My belief is that decentralized design systems are a living, breathing public good. Sharing our visual brand design progress publicly is a milestone in translating the work from design files to the broader community. The purpose is to illuminate our team\u2019s work, inspire your own, spark questions, and open a channel for our design team to connect with you, our community and peers.  Gitcoin\u2019s Color History When Gitcoin was transitioning from a company to a DAO, our creative department was a truly permissionless place. Every design asset was created through bounties, which is how Octavian joined the workstream. He organized all the designs and artwork flying around into a truly considered design system, giving a sense of clarity and purpose to the identity work. The original brand colors are a balanced range of bright, mellow, cool, warm and neutral tones:  1600\u00d7898 7.74 KB   Color Evolution Our evolving color palette reflects our current brand strategy, while also considering the growing needs and considerations of our sub-brands and products. The color strategy I\u2019m sharing below is a work in progress that our designers are refining. Our design system is scheduled to be complete on Friday, February 03. In February, MMM and GPC designers are planning to design together to adopt and adapt the evolving brand design system. Change is imperative for cultivating growth and delivering the best possible experiences for the people who interact with Gitcoin. We\u2019re creating a shared visual language to welcome people to our ecosystem, whether our audience is developers, program managers, new-to-crypto regens, or potential grants round collaborators hoping to learn more about us.  Reviewing Design When looking at work in progress, I find it can be helpful to reference our brand personality guardrails: Gitcoin is\u2026 Knowledgeable not pretentious Relatable not casual Dynamic not brash Intentional not chaotic Generous not overbearing Open not reckless Optimistic not naive Delightful not silly  Color Pillars  1600\u00d7900 7.88 KB  Our color pillars are designed to support a range of visual expression within the DAO \u2013 illustrations, social materials, product design, merch, print, and any unknown future needs. Color pillars are the individual color families outlined in this graphic. Every color pillar serves a purpose \u2013 the colors that are connected to our original brand are clearly detailed below.  1600\u00d7900 333 KB   Color System Our color system is organized by color pillars, color families, and color expression. Color pillars are the individual colors outlined above.  1600\u00d7900 111 KB   Color families Our color families are Neutral, Day, Dusk, and Spot. The purpose of color families is to provide clarity on how to approach a broad color palette. Designers can make thoughtful choices, organize color palettes based on use cases, and map decisions to how any color appears in our system.  Neutral The Neutral palette comprises the Sand and Moon pillars. Essentially our lightest, softest tones and our deepest, richest greys make up the entirety of the Neutral palette. You can use these colors every day to establish a baseline or foundation for your work.  1600\u00d7900 23.7 KB  There\u2019s a new opportunity to bring a more grounded tone to our design work. Drawing colors from the Neutral palette might encourage a subtle tone shift that conveys confidence, whether it\u2019s a presentation about protocol functionality or the web colors we choose for developer documentation.  Dusk Dusk mode is for day to day use as our own dark side of the moss. The Dusk palette refers to the 700 and 800 shades of Lichen, Petal, Sun, Nectary, Wave, Sky, and Passionflower.  1600\u00d7900 23 KB   Day The day palette is core to our everyday colors. When you\u2019re designing an uplifting image or graphic, this is where to start. Our optimistic hues can brighten up any design or illustration. The Day palette is the range of light to mid tones of the Nectary, Sun, Passionflower, Petal, Wave, Sky & Lichen families.  1600\u00d7900 41.6 KB   Spot colors Spot colors are designed to be used sparingly for a pop of color, special merch designs, or an eccentric meme. Spot colors are for moments of intention, when you want to call attention to an action, or when you want to imbue a design with a jolt of energy. Spot colors are the 600 tones of the Lichen, Petal, Wave, Sky, Nectary, Sun & Passionflower families.  1600\u00d7900 15 KB   Color expression The color palettes are in creative development. Our team is working to solidify our choices and make thoughtful conjectures that benefit the brand, design, product and dev functions in the present moment and with an eye on the future. This is truly in process, so you\u2019re getting a window into our virtual studio. Your perspective in the comments would be considered, and your thoughts are welcome.  Lichenpunk Lichenpunk is our core design palette for the flagship Gitcoin brand. Our team lifts from lichenpunk to communicate a sense of mutuality in our work, from design to illustrations to motion graphics.  1600\u00d7900 30.3 KB   Dawnpunk Dawnpunk is a palette intended for special use only. Think occasional microsite experiences, limited-edition merch, or unique partnership expressions like Metalabel.   1600\u00d7900 31.4 KB    Lunarpunk Lunarpunk is intended for products, protocols, experiences, and sub-brands that are connected to the lunarpunk ethos of security and privacy. Gitcoin Passport visuals to launch were created with this in mind, and the brand expresses a more serious tone through a darker palette.  1600\u00d7900 28 KB   Solarpunk Solarpunk is a legacy ethos that creates a bridge between Gitcoin yesterday and today. As a guidepost, we use solarpunk to communicate regen vibes. Solarpunk is well-positioned to be the flagship colorway for Allo Protocol.  1600\u00d7900 28.5 KB   Our Approach to Decentralized Color Design  1600\u00d71600 38.6 KB  Since Gitcoin is naturally evolving with a wide range of visual design touchpoints, we\u2019re adapting our approach to color. Examples of visual design touchpoints are products, websites, protocol marketing, social posts, videos, events, merch and more. Our biomemetic color palette reflects the diversity of our brand expression, and the biodiversity of the natural elements we\u2019re drawing inspiration from. The range of colors allows us to flex and apply expressions to sub-brands and various product needs that gives them a unique look and feel while staying tethered to the Gitcoin core brand. Our colors exist in the liminal space between modularity and autonomy. Stay close to the color values, and reinterpret the color families as needed. Aligning with the unique color values allows our brand to stay cohesive with plenty of room for creative, strategic expression.  Composability  modular1600\u00d71600 49.9 KB  Our palettes are designed to be composable. While our color families include logic and a framework for color groupings, every color is designed to be paired together. There are no wrong answers, with key exceptions for accessibility that we\u2019re annotating as we complete our design system. Part of working in a decentralized brand is making choices about how design elements go together. The design system we\u2019re creating intends to remove obstacles and guesswork while providing room for expression and exploration. Our palette organization is intended as a launchpad for your creations with guardrails to support cohesion.  Thank you Please feel free to ask clarifying questions or leave feedback in the comments!  1440\u00d71132 213 KB  Helpful tip: When giving feedback, aim to be as objective as possible. Explore where your thinking originates. Does your point of view connect to the brand strategy? Is your perspective connected to our values? How so? Our next post will be about TYPOGRAPHY. ",

The work is designed to shine a light on the larger function of Gitcoin, as well as reflect light on you as a contributor or community member.   Gitcoin\u2019s Type Stack Gitcoin currently uses Miriam Libre for headlines and Libre Franklin as a content font. The type scales are well-designed (thanks, Octavian!)  1600\u00d71386 249 KB   Making Changes Our brand design process started with an internal conversation and spirited debate about typography. Do we need to change the fonts? Yes. Could we change our brand without changing the fonts? Yes and\u2026it\u2019s not an ideal path. How would a font update cascade across the web and product pages? In a way that considers each surface as a system with shared universal components. What is that process going to be like? Coordinated across workstreams and woven into the S17 roadmap. TLDR; We\u2019re changing the fonts! The goal of our design system is to be functional, relevant, and endure the next 3-5 years (at least). There is one guiding principle for our typography: Choose authenticity first. In practice, that means no trendy fonts and no hypermodern fluff.  Font Shift I lead creative with intuition and trust. There\u2019s a healthy tension in this style of working. Logic is the foundation of good design. Design that allows for risk-taking leads to great work. Surprises found in the discovery phase can point a designer to an entirely new and resonant direction. Our small brand design team spent time exploring and culling type options in equal measure, then repeating that process until we found the most resonant fonts that align with our brand\u2019s tone of voice, and meet all of our practical requirements of legibility and considered context.  1300\u00d71190 149 KB  Screenshot of our Figma archive file. To help guide the work beyond personal preference, we consulted the brand strategy guardrails almost like an oracle. Does this font inspire trust? Is this font forward-thinking? Is the typeface open and friendly? 1600\u00d71266 161 KB  This image is posted in our design files the way a motivational poster would hang in a studio.  Choosing fonts In the end, we chose one or two fonts that came into play early in the process. As we started stress testing the font pairings and found an early choice for paragraphs unsuitable for long term use, we rerouted to find a suitable alternative. There are so many decisions and considerations that go into a font stack. If anyone wants to hear more on this topic or about our process to align on the choices, let me know and our team will be happy to share a new topic on type. For now, let\u2019s explore the new fonts of Gitcoin!  Type System  1641920\u00d71080 19.6 KB   154a1920\u00d71080 38.8 KB  Our type system comprises two categories that support our visual language as a hybrid system that lives between a traditional set of rules and decentralized lines in the sand. Core type is a set of boilerplate fonts that are friendly, functional, reliable, technical yet inclusive. The fonts selected for our core type stack are well-suited for a range of touchpoints, from print to product. Flex type is a collection of display fonts that are experimental, abundantly joyful, thoughtful typefaces that stray from the norm and take risks. This type system is inspired by one of our designers, Biux, who is frequently bringing new and interesting typography into the mix of her work. Our Gitcoin Community Call banners are a solid example of how Biux\u2019s work inspired an emerging permissionless playground of typographic expression.  Flyer \u2192 131920\u00d71080 131 KB   Core Type Our core fonts were chosen for their ability to play well together as a type stack. Their forms and designs are naturally compatible.  1600\u00d7900 118 KB   Grad Grad is a smart, friendly, warm, inviting font that says \u201cWelcome to Gitcoin! Come explore pluralism in the Quadratic Lands.\u201d Like Gitcoin, the typeface Grad has undergone its own transformations. Originally designed as a bitmap font by Phil Martin in the early 90s, it was completely reworked as a digital Opentype font in 2004 by Mark Simonson.  1600\u00d7900 91.7 KB   Chromatic Chromatic is described by its designing foundry, Colophon, as being an \u201canti-genre\u201d font. It spans many regions of styles, each with its own expression of the core font personality. We\u2019re drawn to the Grotesk version of this font, and think it works quite well in pairing with Grad. Since our use cases for typography are as broad as the font styles available, we believe Chromatic is a font that can grow with our needs over time. For now, we\u2019ve chosen a versatile weight from a deceptively complex font.  1600\u00d7900 67.2 KB  Kudos to Harry for introducing Chromatic to our type system.  DM Mono DM Mono is an open source, monospace font from an extensive family designed by Colophon Foundry. It is reliable and well suited for clarity, brevity, and precision.  1600\u00d7900 180 KB   Flex Type  Dahlia Dahlia is a romantic serif designed by an independent type foundry in Paris, Violaine & J\u00e9r\u00e9my. After working through the idea of flex type, we decided to ship Dahlia and bring one weight of this lovely font into our brand. Dahlia is a team favorite, primed to be mixed with our core type in headings or expressive type designs.  1600\u00d7900 45 KB   Serous Serous is a geometric typeface by Formist Foundry, designed to \u201cembody the feeling of liquid.\u201d Serous is available in four weights and best used with a strong eye for typography. Its place in our flex type stack is special occasion use, such as partnerships, print materials, or limited edition merch.  1600\u00d7900 42.9 KB   Moret, Boulder & Perandory As I wrote earlier, Perandory is our current font for community event flyers. Moret may find a home in one of our protocols as we extend the core brand in February. Boulder Mono is an intriguing option for sample graphics where we may want to call attention to an event, such as our presence at ETHDenver.  1600\u00d7900 89.3 KB   Thank you Please ask clarifying questions or leave feedback in the comments!  1126\u00d71112 159 KB  Pro tip: When giving feedback, aim to be as objective as possible. Explore where your thinking originates. Does your point of view connect to the brand strategy? Is your perspective connected to our values? How so? Our next post will be about LOGOS. ",

                    "content": "This is the fifth topic in a series on Gitcoin\u2019s evolving brand. Our visual brand identity is evolving as part of a larger reflection of our transition from an Impact DAO to a Protocol DAO, which we\u2019re announcing at ETHDenver. Process As a values-led design team, we\u2019ve been working to mindfully create concepts and ideas that are meaningful. This work is rooted in our Brand Values, and evolved in parallel with the brand strategy. For a refresh on the preceding work, watch our December Community Call and follow along with our presentation. Outcome Our design team has been producing visual assets and ideas to support the brand strategy that many of you contributed to and led by Alexa Lombardo. The design work being shared today is one part of a brand evolution process. The work is designed to shine a light on the larger function of Gitcoin, as well as reflect light on you as a contributor or community member.   Current Logo  1600\u00d7900 49.5 KB  The current Gitcoin logo is our beloved astronaut helmet icon paired with Futura. The wordmark itself has nice letterspacing designed by Octavian, and he cleaned up the helmet icon as well. The original helmet design is an artifact from a less structured, more anonymous time in the dao\u2019s history. We don\u2019t actually know who made it\u2026we do know that Gitcoiners love it. Futura is an interesting choice for the wordmark because it\u2019s a font that is classic, timeless, and always looks good with the right kerning. This typeface weaves in and out of fashion every ten years or so. A few years from now, you\u2019ll see Futura everywhere again. The last time I remember Futura being so popular is when it became a web font in the early 2010s. Suddenly Futura was everywhere on the web, including whatever websites I was making at that time.  I digress.  Logo process After some initial exploration, periods of rest on this creative subject, and later conversations with thought partners, we landed on a logo refresh that feels less like a redesign and more in line with our theme of brand evolution.  Logo Evolution  Wordmark   1600\u00d7716 9.04 KB     1600\u00d7900 44.4 KB   Futura becomes Futura Now, a modern refresh of the iconic typeface by Monotype. The kerning, or space between letters, is tighter which contributes to a feeling of healthy closeness between the letterforms, particularly the C and the O. The shape and proximity of the letterforms lends itself to the concepts of connection and communal vision we\u2019re exploring as a dao.  Helmet  1600\u00d71600 58 KB   1600\u00d7900 58.9 KB  It\u2019s worth noting that the dark teal visor color is now accessible on light backgrounds, where the previous Gitcoin teal did not meet accessibility standards for color contrast.  1476\u00d71476 66 KB  There are aspects to the original helmet construction that are off balance. When you adjust any part of the shape to make it right in your eyes (a subjective endeavour), a different piece of the helmet is suddenly wrong. A space helmet that looks so simple is actually pretty complicated. The helmet is an enigma. I love that about it.  New helmet, new era Our designer Harry Eastham thoughtfully poured energy into adjusting the helmet to be softer, rounder, more proportional, adjusting the angles in a way that aligns with Eduardo\u2019s forty-five degree angle suggestions, and generally considering the details.  1600\u00d71598 254 KB   Logo system  Our logo guidelines Simplifying and clarifying our brand logos with concise guidelines. Please note that the following are marketing guidelines. Separate considerations are being made for our product UIs, specifically the use of the helmet logo in our navigation headers. Context is key!  1600\u00d71600 36.8 KB  For our logo, the wordmark is supreme. Our wordmark is clean, simple and distinctive. It\u2019s new and feels familiar. The characters and letterspacing invite a new view of our legacy logo. The wordmark will essentially be used everywhere that the full (helmet+wordmark) logotype is used today. Think website headers, product headers, merch, content marketing, slide presentations, and work that is seen on a daily basis.   1600\u00d71600 49 KB  The helmet is a standalone detail or a feature. Let\u2019s preserve the magic and protect it from overuse by showing it less often and more intentionally. Example places to use the helmet include web footers, social media, memes, special edition pins and merch.   1600\u00d7716 33.3 KB  Our combined logo - helmet and wordmark - is available for use when needed.  1600\u00d71525 48.1 KB  The combined logo options are available for places where the wordmark might be less capable of standing out on its own. One example is a poster or presentation slide with many different logos from industry partners or peers all displayed together.  Thank you  Animation sketch from Harry  1000\u00d71000 129 KB  Please ask clarifying questions or leave feedback in the comments. Pro tip: When giving feedback, aim to be as objective as possible. Explore where your thinking originates. Does your point of view connect to the brand strategy? Is your perspective connected to our values? How so? Our next post will be about PHOTOGRAPHY. ",

Let\u2019s preserve the magic and protect it from overuse by showing it less often and more intentionally. Example places to use the helmet include web footers, social media, memes, special edition pins and merch.   I just wanted to add some some historical context on the original intent behind making the logo a helmet. The idea was that the helmet protects you (and enhances your abilities) as you enter the wild/new frontier of web3.  It helps give you the confidence to leave behind the dry bland corporate or uni world and enter a pluralistic frontier where many new things are possible. If you watch this video (the og launch video for Gitcoin) you will see the transition at the 0:24 mark.      The inspiration for the transition was the transition for Dorothy in wizard of oz from her bland world in Kansas to the wonderful world of Oz.  uqm1b7w4l7151965\u00d7437 71.5 KB  Anyway.

Funny story - When I was creating and stewarding the brand, it was nearly all about bots.  Later the bots transformed into astronauts around 2020/2021.  I\u2019m not sure why or how that transition was made. I always thought that astronauts were a bit cliche (everyone in web3 uses space/astronauts in their imagery, its part of the \u201cto the moon!\u201d moonboi culture of crypto) but I went along with it because the designs were cool and the metaphor of going to space and trying to inhabit an inhabitable environment there is also a metaphor for doing hard things like funding public goods (going to the Quadratic Lands)! Though thinking back on the launch video, I suppose the visual image of the person putting on the helmet looks kind of astronaut-ey in retrospect.  The idea behind doing that was using computers to augment our abilities and give us superpowers to explore new frontiers.  But the launch video wasnt set in space so  Anyway. I support 100% whatever the brand stewards want to do.  Just adding more context because I   the Gitcoin brand.     birdsoar:  Can you imagine how the fresh helmet will look as a metallic pin?!

Also really appreciate this additional context. The helmets - and their history - are and always will be important. same case for the evolution of the narrative you explained @owocki - and also agree with your point about lore @birdsoar I\u2019d love to see us complement these historical visuals/icons with something emblematic of where we\u2019re going and the actual tools we\u2019re creating. The robots, astronauts, love are all great. But our products have also evolved - we\u2019re building protocols for funding mechanisms and sybil defense plus a stack of apps that make running grants programs easier and foster more community led funding opportunities. Yes, all of this contributes to the journey into a new economic order, a new world, the quadratic lands - but there is also a wealth here and now for us to communicate about those products before we\u2019ve even gotten to that new place. Based on this brand expansion work, lot the evolved visuals that are emerging will help us tie to the two together, which I\u2019m very excited about. Looking forward to seeing how we weave in new illustrations that connect our past, present and future to our products and our vision. ",

We\u2019re taking a biomorphic design approach to living forms as a starting point for our visual exploration.  3D Symbiosis  1600\u00d7900 213 KB   1600\u00d7900 191 KB  Inspired by natural ecosystems, influenced by local native tree species and their accompanying vegetation, fungi, lichen & moss.  Line & Weight  1600\u00d7900 157 KB   1600\u00d7900 251 KB  Our work can be communicated with minimal, intricate geometry and naturally occurring networks, organic construction (think the gills of a mushroom) and invisible routes. Line weights can vary slightly, depending on the shape and context. Line style, too, can vary according to the desired outcome.  Shape & Texture  1600\u00d7900 189 KB   1600\u00d7900 554 KB  Circular shapes and freeform, loosely structured organic shapes can create a sense of harmony and differentiation that is found in natural forms. When gradients are applied to smoother surfaces, they become a textural and a subtler form of biomimicry, like the prismatic shine one might find inside a seashell. We\u2019re working on more facets of the brand with illustration, including people, and can\u2019t wait to show you when it\u2019s ready.  Thank you  1600\u00d71197 410 KB  Please ask clarifying questions or leave feedback in the comments. Pro tip: When giving feedback, aim to be as objective as possible. Explore where your thinking originates. Does your point of view connect to the brand strategy? Is your perspective connected to our values? How so? Our upcoming post is on decentralized design documentation as a public good, and will be the last of this series. ",

Our visual brand identity is evolving as part of a larger reflection of our transition from an Impact DAO to a Protocol DAO, which we\u2019re announcing at ETHDenver. Decentralized design is a living, breathing public good. Sharing our visual brand design progress publicly is a milestone in translating the work from figma files to our community. The purpose of this post is to illuminate the meaning of our team\u2019s work, inspire your own, and spark questions. This post is opening a channel for our design team to connect with you, our community and peers. Process As a values-led design team, we\u2019ve been working to mindfully create concepts and ideas that are meaningful. This work is rooted in our Brand Values, and evolved in parallel with the brand strategy. For a refresh on the preceding work, watch our December Community Call and follow along with our presentation. Outcome Our design team has been producing visual assets and ideas to support the brand strategy that many of you contributed to in efforts led by Alexa Lombardo. The design work being shared today is one part of a brand evolution process. The work is designed to shine a light on the larger function of Gitcoin, as well as reflect light on you as a contributor or community member.  Design posts in this series:  Visually Adapting Gitcoin\u2019s Brand Lichenpunk & All the Punks Color Typography Logo Photography Illustration   Our Visual Language documentation is public and open!   Screen Shot 2023-02-13 at 5.29.41 PM1184\u00d7764 100 KB   Goals In less than three months, from consensus on a brand refresh to today, our brand is brand new! Our brand guide is now available as a public good to anyone with the link. Our peers in web3 spaces are taking note, and lichenpunk is being appreciated by artists and devs alike.  Screen Shot 2023-02-13 at 5.33.09 PM1188\u00d7666 100 KB   Screen Shot 2023-02-13 at 5.31.25 PM1192\u00d7458 58.9 KB  Any artist, creative, designer, or inspired person can take our Visual Language document and begin making something new. A permissionless intention and structure was woven into these pages to encourage expression on behalf of the DAO. This document is not the end of the brand work \u2013 it\u2019s the beginning. Decentralized design in the dao is a goal we\u2019re working toward. In the near future, we\u2019re planning time retool Bounties in a way that\u2019s clear and considerate of all parties. Inspired by our past coordination with communally sourced art, we\u2019re specifically considering ways we can work with NFT artists for mutual benefit. If you want to be a thought partner with us on this, please let me know. Our immediate focus is steady on the visual design side of the mountain. Phase II of the brand work includes developing identities, icons, illustrations, and product styles for all of our protocols and sub-brands, most notably Allo and Passport. This phase began last week, the day we launched the brand guide . Protocol and product visuals are our central point of focus as a visual design team for S17, alongside key projects like the Gitcoin website. As the grants program shifts during S17, design is aligned with being a responsive partner for creative outputs. There are so many touchpoints that our brand moves through, each with a tone of voice that is considered. The brand we\u2019re launching now is designed to continue evolving with us through the seasons. A brand is not a fixed point on a map. It\u2019s designed to change, as we change. Decentralized design guides change like the seasons of earth. They\u2019re set in motion, like planetary bodies. As designers lend their unique blend of voices and skills to the brand, whether that be through color, texture, photography, or motion design, the visual nature of Gitcoin\u2019s expression will evolve. A unique example of this is our budding partnership with Metalabel - two brands with one common goal, creating a custom piece of collectable art, with proceeds benefitting the community. For the foreseeable future, a centralized design team is essential for making all of this work possible. Our designers are reliable, focused, aligned with our mission, open to learning, trustworthy and incredibly skilled.   Decentralized Creative Leadership Our design system, and design team by nature, work in a hybrid model between decentralized and centralized. In any workstream, there are people who make decisions by necessity in a leadership capacity. As the creative director, my decision rights extend to any touchpoint for design or artistic output: videos, banners, websites, anything. In a broad sense, our design team is co-led by peers. All ideas are welcome. Concepts are shared freely. I create design briefs or prompt requests based on what the DAO needs, or by requests for design support across workstreams. Designers are free to respond to the needs in their own time, in their own way, in the expressions of design that feel right to them. We share a language for getting things done. We dialogue about the best approach and reach consensus about choices, whether they be color or style. We work in public where team members from our team or across the DAO weigh in with their thoughts and opinions about the work.  Creative roles in a dao are like volunteering in a community garden. People assume responsibilities based on skills, desire, and availability. We sign up for gardening shifts, sharing tools and tips for technique. Together we survey the landscape, prune the plants, decide which varieties will be planted next year, and tend the soil in anticipation of that. My role as a creative director is to curate ideas, not gatekeep them. If a brand is a garden, then my work is to create necessary structure and favorable conditions for plants. In a shared garden, the brand guide would become about whether seeds prefer direct planting vs pre-planting, which trees prefer shade, which flowers need the most light to thrive, and what type of moss to place nearby so they permeate through the seasons. As designers, we\u2019re motivated by process as a guided approach toward results. Constructing healthy guardrails is a mechanism for how to arrive at solutions. The design team is encouraged to stay curious and open, to learn by making. A spirit of openness is reflected in our design work. Decentralized creative leadership in a hybrid model is about creating an organic, flexible structure for the logical discipline of design. I metabolize the work happening around me: on protocols, on product design, in grants rounds, in neighboring ecosystems, in marketing channels, with our developing product strategies, with frameworks, in operations, in artist communities, in plurality research, in past Gitcoin projects, in Ethereum\u2019s Infinite Garden, and beyond. Creative directors in design communities till the soil until plants can grow, measuring acidity and adding nutrition, adding the right amount of water, designing structure to support plant growth, and making informed choices for all these actions that will yield the best results. New designers bring ideas from their mind gardens. And we create a new moment together. A world of decentralized design is a world of possibility.

Our visual brand identity is evolving as part of a larger reflection of our transition from an Impact DAO to a Protocol DAO, which we\u2019re announcing at ETHDenver. Process As a values-led design team, we\u2019ve been working to mindfully create concepts and ideas that are meaningful.

The design work being shared today is one part of a larger brand evolution process. The work is designed to shine a light on the larger function of Gitcoin, as well as reflect light on you as a contributor or community member.  Gitcoin Visual Language Starting in GR15, our visuals began to morph and evolve into new territory in an evolving DAO ecosystem preparing for product & protocol launches. We started experimenting with shades, tones, and styles from our existing toolkit. Most importantly, we explored where to maintain the edges of the brand and when to break the rules.  1600\u00d71145 226 KB  For example, our current homepage banner uses legacy Gitcoin brand colors with a new illustration style. Artwork by Biux. When we started considering how developing our protocols might impact our brand language, contributors openly asked questions in a community workshop: Where does the humanistic element - the focus on the natural world - come into play? What about human collaboration? How important is it that these are included in the visual identity? What role does creativity play when it comes to forward thinking? Do we need to be direct about this? Months later, the questions are still resonating with us. This process of inquiry & community input led us to develop a unique vision: BIOMEMETIC MAGIC.  biomemetic-magic1080\u00d71002 203 KB   Biomemetic Magic Biomemetic magic is our semantic vision of Gitcoin\u2019s heartbeat, and more specifically the values we uphold as we build, coordinate, communicate, and use quadratic funding tools to expand and share as a network. Words are spells, and the underlying concepts defined below leverage our unique potential to create, fund, and share in service to the communities and cultures who would benefit from mutuality.  990\u00d7902 22 KB  Biomimicry is designing and building tools and structures that are based on organic materials and processes. Memetic is the study of information and culture. Magic is influencing ordinary life through acts of intention.  Conceptual Linguistics  990\u00d7902 24.2 KB  Biomimicry can be seen interchangeably with nature - our source of inspiration for building structures, protocols, networks, and communities. Memetic can be distilled to the word culture, in reference to our presence and contributions to the web3 community as well as our burgeoning audience. Magic can be understood as intuition. In practice, intuition translates to clarity of intention, the ability to read the energy of the market, encouraging ourselves and fellow buidlrs to confidently step into the unknowable future, practice steps of trust, and build with patience.  990\u00d7902 26.6 KB  Biomimicry and nature can be read as intelligence, the invisible grid underlying our networks and protocols. Memetic and culture can be refined further as ideation. Ideation is a constant source of energy \u2013 both inside the DAO and the web3 community. Our ability to constantly improve our products, protocols, strategies, and yes, memes - is a rational map for future work. Magic and intuition lead to action. In this context, action is any progress made toward a shared goal and desired outcome. Applied thought, reason, logic, science, and math all converge through magic. Applied Concepts You might be wondering, \u201cHow does this become something?\u201d While we co-create definitions for how to develop biomemetic magic across product and content marketing, here is a window into our visual design system.  Introducing Lichenpunk  lichenpunk1736\u00d71640 1.12 MB  Artwork by Harry Lichenpunk is an expression of Gitcoin\u2019s niche presence, and the biomimicry aspect of biomemetic magic. Lichenpunk is the rebelliousness of mutuality, the subtle and humble networks of relationships that allow our network to flourish. Lichenpunk is our adaptive response to solarpunk and lunarpunk. It\u2019s a little more granular and specific to our networks, protocols, and community expression. While solarpunk aligns with our regen vibes, we\u2019re expanding through the scope of that movement. For lunarpunk, Gitcoin isn\u2019t necessarily pessimistic about blockchain security and bad actors. We just care about and plan for privacy/security protections proactively. We can be protective without being fearful. We can believe in a positive future while working through the practical hurdles to get there. Lichenpunk draws a figurative circle around all of that.  Next steps  forum-postt720\u00d7606 430 KB  Lunarpunk and solarpunk definitely have a place in our brand system. We\u2019ll cover that and more in our next post, especially with how brand applies to our growing product suite. For now, I\u2019m happy to hear thoughts and questions! Make your voice heard in the comments, and help support the brand evolution in the process. <3 ",

When we first began the brand evolution work with our vision, mission, and values, there was a clear cohesion and alignment across the DAO. But translating that into a shared design ethos is an entirely separate challenge. Biomemetic Magic as the heartbeat of the Gitcoin brand - and the expressions that cultivate an emotional connection between us, our community, our audiences, our users - is so powerful. It speaks to the evolving nature of a living, breathing Gitcoin, where we operate by a set of shared values, working towards a shared vision, unafraid to follow our intuition, test new things, If we take a look back at the values we originally concepted (Empowerment, Impact, Mutuality, Trust, Forward Thinking), they are all embodied here. Simultaneously, this direction allows us to flex on certain values or personality traits at different times, which turns the brand and our visuals into more strategic tools to actively support our product initiatives and goals. As the brand evolves and these new design systems emerge by product, we\u2019re going to see how come together the strengthen our overarching brand. Looking forward to this continued series and kudos to @birdsoar and the entire design team for this work! ",

Lichenpunk is the rebelliousness of mutuality, the subtle and humble networks of relationships that allow our network to flourish.   Nice! I honestly had to look up what Lichen means, so I\u2019ll add it for the other people who also are as uninformed as I am: \" A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship.\" On this:     birdsoar:  For lunarpunk, Gitcoin isn\u2019t necessarily pessimistic about blockchain security and bad actors.   I kinda feel the need to highlight that there\u2019s really nothing pessimistic about Lunarpunk, it just starts from the assumption that a conflict between crypto and existing power structures is essentially preprogrammed. To me this is realistic, not pessimistic. From the lunarpunk manifesto, recommended read for anyone: Lunarpunk is more like a forest. A dense cover of encryption protects tribes and offers sanctuary for the persecuted. Wooded groves provide a crucial line of defense. Lunar landscapes are dark. They are also teeming with life. Lunar tech is owned and operated by the people themselves in service of their freedom. Lunar settlements are a sanctuary where difference is nurtured and protected. The lunar cycle upholds democratic techniques against authoritarian technology, freedom against surveillance, and diversity against monoculture. Appreciate the MMM discussion series, keep them coming! ",
