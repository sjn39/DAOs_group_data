Example releasing or allowing businesses in education / Jobs and so forth to have a community driven purpose for the betterment of huminity,  Profits will come naturally because education / work ( jobs ) will never go away. I have a business in education for example in Vietnam / China \u2014 We have 16 000 teachers. Imagine the salary earners *( Teachers ) in education helping the world become a better place on the one hand - Increasing capital for the schools whom are allocated x amount of tokens which accrues value over time, why ? If I was a long term investor and I know that there is a coin / token that represents education /  Jobs around the world id invest long term. There also will be a use case for this token - Once the token gets released an abundance of new options are open for teachers who are at the forefront of adoption as well as schools / universities and so forth\u2026 My company has a website with profiles attached for 16 000 teachers already/ If they are rewarded for adding their own liquidity ( they receive salaries on a monthly basis ) then again there is much better chance of the token success over time. Why ? They make a higher salary the more they hold. How Uni is better than the rest is offering or having exclusivity for this token \u2014 Exchanges can list and buyers can buy / sell//// This is what crypto needs. ",

Point out the growth Uniswap has seen recently, the recent developments & the major fact there\u2019s now Uniswap Governance (fueled by the UNI token). Word of mouth will be valuable. Share your experience,  point out the things you like about using Uniswap, because chances are, others would like these same things.  2.05B in liquidity, $500M+ daily volume, 9,600 pairs, fees distributed to liquidity providers, these are pretty hard to ignore for a lot of people   Top of that, I\u2019m sure the community will come up with great proposals to distribute UNI to more community members. Which would (hopefully) also attract a lot of new users. Just my personal thoughts! ",

But before a user can really understand the underlying dapp, they need to better understand the tools to use to be successful like Etherscan and Metamask. Without knowing how to adjust gwei in advanced settings or change the nonce of a transaction to drop and replace a txn that has been pending for a long time, the user isn\u2019t really set up for success in the current landscape. For reference I helped several friends claim their UNI last week and most of them just wanted to turn it into ETH or USDC right away but bc gas prices were high along with volatility of the ETH/UNI prices, there was a lot of wasted gas on failed transactions and long wait times. Granted my friends didn\u2019t seem to mind at the time bc they each received about $1200, it would\u2019ve been nice for them to understand how to make the transaction go through the first time by setting a competitive gas price or just wait for gas prices to cool down. I found this interesting and wonder if this is a bigger problem than most people realize. If most of the failed txns (wasted gas) is from arb bots who make it up down the road then I guess it\u2019s not that big of a deal but if a solid chunk is from retail users not understanding how to set gas prices, this could be improved upon as we onboard new users.Screen Shot 2020-09-26 at 1.35.37 AM1916\u00d7946 54.1 KB ",

Which is good \u2026but then we have these arbitrary bots and up gas price fee txs and complete gas war craze going on. Wich these coinbase wallets cannot deal with. Thus most orders will time out with the eth mining fee payed nevertheless. I had this happen so many times last month, it is absurd. But the problem is the bots, not the user friendly wallet.

For simplicity sake i would rather prefer the route of l2 scaling eth and moving gas guzzlers to other chains like omg to relieve the eth network and keep business running as usual. We as a community shouldn\u2019t be fighting each other with inflating higher gas prices. (At least if your not a miner) It\u2019s is a ratrace going nowhere. New users are scared away by high tx costs. If i was normal and sane\u2026 i would have never payed 30 dollar in eth to do a transaction on uniswap when gas prices were peaking.

(a) As a Liquidity Provider, I am incentivized to provide liquidity because of the high fees (high earnings). (b) As a swapper, I am incentivized to swap on Uniswap because of the lower slippage and low(-ish) gas fees.  For (a), having a tool that would compensate/mitigate/hedge deviation loss. For (b), rollups can (will ?) help reduce the gas fees even more and might allow to find solutions for (a) that don\u2019t increase gas fees too much. TL;DR : Rollups ",

A few questions come to mind - would love to hear opinions on these   Attract new users:   How get more folks to move off CEX\u2019s and onto Uniswap? What barriers make that move hard today? How can Uniswap make that transition easier? How can that be sped up for the next generation of Uniswap users?   Keep current users   It seems like other DEX\u2019s are popping up to compete against Uniswap\u2019s known shortcomings (Google & read: \u201cUnbundling Uniswap: The Future of On-Chain Market Making\u201d) Can Uniswap update it\u2019s pricing algorithm to find off competitors like CoFiX & DODO?(Google and Read: \u201cIntroducing CoFiX: a Next-Generation AMM\u201d) Can Uniswap unbundle itself in a long-term sustainable way?  I\u2019ll be thinking on these in the meantime. [Edit @ 11:05 EST] Adding more color, here is a high-level user journey as I see it TLDR; it is not simple for a crypto newbie to use uniswap  User decides to buy crypto Open account with CEX as fiat-onramp Buy token on that CEX Create a crypto wallet Send tokens from CEX --> wallet Visit uniswap [dot] org Click to app[dot]uniswap[dot]org Connect wallet to uniswap app Complete pre-determined swap  ",
