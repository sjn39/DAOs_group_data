                    "content": "Context Why: Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users (e.g. Dharma, Matcha, etc.) How: Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps] Code: https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users Phase 1 Details: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-excluded-proxy-contract-airdrop-phase-1/ Dharma intends to formally propose Phase 1 of the Retroactive UNI Distribution proposal on Friday 23 October. We are announcing this in advance in order to give time for UNI holders to delegate to parties who they are aligned with on this vote \u2014 whether they are in support or opposition of the proposal. We invite all UNI delegations to reach out to us with questions, concerns, or feedback. A brief FAQ on the proposal. What is Phase 1 vs. Phase 2? There are two rough cohorts of users included in the Retroactive Distribution Proposal: users of application integrations and users of DEX aggregators. Given that these two cohorts have very different sizes and very different end-user characteristics, we are separating our proposal into two sequential phases: Phase 1 includes users of the application integrations, Phase 2 includes users of DEX aggregators. How many users are included in Phase 1? Phase 1 includes 12,600 addresses. Won\u2019t this just dilute existing UNI holders? Where is the UNI coming from? This proposal does not dilute existing UNI holders, as it creates no new UNI. If passed, this proposal would transfer UNI from the Uniswap Community Treasury to these users. No new UNI would be minted. Won\u2019t this just put downward price pressure on UNI? Perhaps, but this proposal calls for the distribution of ~5m UNI (current value of ~14.6m USD). With >200m USD in daily trading volume (>20m USD in daily volume on Uniswap alone), this distribution represents less than 10% of daily trading, and we believe is unlikely to materially impact the price of UNI.

The vast majority of support for this proposal does not come from end users - it comes from entities who are very heavily invested in the corporations backing Dharma and other DeFi companies. A proposal like this shouldn\u2019t begin with an ambitious startup corporation. It should begin with an end-user or a group of end-users. It should then garner support as an autonomous proposal before going to a vote. However, instead, Dharma plans to use its whale voting power and VC alliances to smash it through both the proposal and voting stages. This may be tokenized governance, however this certainly is not decentralization. I will be voting no and I will be working hard to secure delegators before the voting period begins. ",

An organization handling 2.71 Billion USD in locked value, and we are going into our 2nd round for 12k * 400 UNI governance tokens = 13.8 Million USD @ current price. The purpose of a governance token is to \u2018govern\u2019 how the treasury is used. Marketing, rewarding devs, rewarding community participants, upgrading our app, etc. In an effort to \u2018decentralize\u2019 this governance, we air-dropped a crap-tonne (canadian for a lot) of tokens to wallets of the \u2018little guys\u2019. The same little guys you purport to defend in your delegation pitch. Additionally, i heard you and your guests on the \u2018trust bubble\u2019 admit that you are not fundamentally opposed to giving Dharma et al. users their drop. (bless their hearts for they are mostly blissfully unaware of this debate). Now let\u2019s fast forward\u2026  You stand in opposition of letting the \u2018little guy\u2019 claim their air-drop You stand in opposition of letting the Uniswap governance community embrace another 12k souls to enrich this group You stand in opposition, apparently, of diluting the governance pool so that the \u2018whales\u2019 won\u2019t have their way with us  Dharma does not own those addresses. They do not have any financial incentive here except to campaign faithfully for their \u2018little guys\u2019. To be honest, they sound the more honourable for it. At no point have i heard anything but carefully woven appeals for their users. They have been respectful, transparent, and committed to their principles from the beginning. What have we done in response?  We have accused them of manipulation to control Uniswap We have slandered them and their attempted \u2018overthrow\u2019 of our community We have accosted them for forming an evil plutocracy with fellow conspirators We have made every effort to conjure whatever fantastical scenario we can dream up to fulfill our own self-serving narrative that we are defending the \u2018little guy\u2019      chrisblec:  instead, Dharma plans to use its whale voting power and VC alliances to smash it through both the proposal and voting stages.   VCs are necessary to secure enough funding to keep the Unicorn going. Code doesn\u2019t write itself. Check out the UNI investor group here. And here is the SEC filing. Dharma Labs itself has survived 3 rounds of investment. Can you appreciate how hard it is to work for a startup, much less feel responsible for the livelihood of everyone that works for you? I know, i\u2019ve been a part of 2 failed startups (not all failed mind you). The anxiety felt by the teams who didn\u2019t know when the plug would be pulled is heart wrenching. Watching your hard work and passion go for naught is devastating. And, here we are bemoaning the \u2018Whales\u2019! Dharma Labs is not a whale. They are an honest organization trying to make their way through this crazy space we call home, and they are trying to help their \u2018littler guys\u2019. There\u2019s an old Indian proverb. \u201cwhen you are a flea on the back of a camel, even the fly next to you looks huge and you don\u2019t even know you are on the camel\u201d     chrisblec:  This may be tokenized governance, however this certainly is not decentralization.   The delegation mechanic allows you to vote with tokens that were \u2018delegated\u2019 to you. It absolutely IS decentralized, because someone \u2018delegated\u2019 their UNI to dharma because they believe in their approach. They can just as easily retract their delegated UNI when they no longer agree with their platform. Now, if you are going to convince us that big \u2018whales\u2019 with lots of UNI are lining up to support Dharma, then Chris, you don\u2019t have an issue with Dharma do you? At that point you are faced with the contradiction between your decentralized beliefs and what the Uniswap Governance structure seems to be allowing right beneath our noses. This conclusion, of course, is ironic, given that we often claim that the \u2018governance mechanism\u2019 is perfectly fine as is. This contradiction has to be solved somehow. I say we help the Dharma et al. \u2018little guys\u2019. Embrace them and welcome them to our community. Dharma isn\u2019t asking for lower thresholds on either proposals or quorum here. They are doing what they can to defend the best interests of their users. I think that\u2019s commendable. I must also disclose that i hope their organization succeeds. A mobile experience that simplifies the UI is exactly what crypto-DeFi needs for wider adoption and support. ",

In practice, though, this is quite difficult given the current distribution dynamics and proposal thresholds for UNI \u2014 the stagnation of Uniswap governance up until now (despite a litany of different proposals being heavily discussed in these forums) is demonstrable evidence to this point.  Our first proposal aimed to remedy exactly this, and was strenuously opposed by many of the same community members who\u2019ve been vocally opposed to the retroactive distribution proposal. I want to also quickly address a misconception, namely:     chrisblec:  The vast majority of support for this proposal does not come from end users - it comes from entities who are very heavily invested in the corporations backing Dharma and other DeFi companies   This is just plainly false; the vast, vast majority of UNI that has been delegated to Dharma are from known entities who are not invested in Dharma, directly or indirectly, in any capacity.  We have no overlap with Uniswap\u2019s cap-table of known investors.  Investors who delegated to us did so because we\u2019ve been active, technical contributors to Compound\u2019s governance.  That\u2019s pretty much the full story. Finally \u2014 a plea for civility! This is going to be a contentious proposal \u2014 probably for good reason!  Let\u2019s keep ad-hominem at a minimum.  I assume no ill intention of @chrisblec and others; I hope they can do the same for us.  We\u2019re simply the messengers acting on behalf of our users and the users of many other projects affected by the proxy contract exclusion. ",

Should tokenized governance look like a pseudo-cartel of interconnected business entities, driven by the motivation to generate a profit off a cohort of users (which you are a part of), being given the sole power to vote for rewards to its users, with the obvious & clear business motivation of retaining those users with a gesture of \u201cgood will\u201d so that it can generate more fees off them in the long-term? Or, should tokenized governance look like the end users - the very ones who are being targeted for revenue & profit - controlling the voting power and ensuring that decentralized protocols make the users the top priority, and not the profit-seeking entities? I will be voting NO to this proposal, but I encourage Dharma users who are in favor of the airdrop to launch their own proposal so that we can consider this issue without the taints of hidden profit motivation & venture-backed collusion.

UNI in the merkle distributor cannot vote. After UNI is claimed by one of the addresses in the merkle distributor, those UNI can be delegated for voting by the address owner.

This doesn\u2019t disincentivize future projects from investing in the Uniswap ecosystem. This decision was made by Uniswap team and not by the Uniswap governance. When it comes to future airdrops: a) there is a high chance that there will be no future airdrops, as airdropping is an inefficient way to spend resources b) even if there were future airdrops, it would be odd to start building something on Uniswap in anticipation of getting an airdrop, don\u2019t you think?  When it comes to future products / projects building on top of Uniswap, there are a lot of ways to incentivize them much more efficiently. If we just stick with the present, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t find a meaningful reason to do an airdrop of UNI. Some people got upset because they didn\u2019t get free money while others did. How does making these people less upset brings value to the network? Why is it a good investment? What will it result in? Isn\u2019t there a better way to spend this money? When it comes to airdrops in general, it seems evident to me that they don\u2019t do much. If people want to participate in Uniswap governance, they don\u2019t need an airdrop for it. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s close to 99% chance that airdrop won\u2019t change it. ",

I feel the same urge as Caesar right now. How awfully centralist of me. The protracted debate is hurting all sides at this point. Once dug in, humans are unlikely to change their mind. We are predisposed and wired for confirmation bias. As much as i enjoy hearing the @reluctantdelagate reluctantly campaigning that VC-backed bad guys don\u2019t deserve to support their users, the circular argument has run its course. The bottom-line is that if you have heavily invested in crypto-anarchist ideologies like decentralized governance, anything that smacks of money or power will be mercilessly suppressed. The alternative is to participate in a rational debate, and to walk away feeling like both parties gained through compromise. So, if it must be rhetoric, then i would recommend we lock the debate and go to a vote, and put this to bed. There is enough material here to make an informed decision, and to write a plethora of articles entitled \u201cUniswap drama\u2026\u201d. They have already begun. And please stop claiming this is about protecting the interests of the \u2018little guy\u2019 and ensuring the integrity of the decentralized governance process. The little guys who want to participate in governance with their own UNI, or the little guys that are having a tough time makings ends meet, are not getting well served here. In fact, the few that make it to these forums get overrun with disservice from our members who claim they are being \u2018greedy\u2019 and \u2018dishonest\u2019. It\u2019s no wonder we never hear from them again. Are we ambassadors of a powerful DeFi brand called Uniswap or are we the governance mob? Our job here is NOT to put Dharma on trial for crimes we INSIST they committed. Our job here is to decide if we want to retroactively ASSIST uniswappers who happened to get caught out because they used a proxy client. Uniswappers or LPs that CONTRIBUTED their hard earned capital to our ecosystem and collective wealth. Everything else is theatre and virtue-signaling. I get it. For some here it\u2019s \u2018fun\u2019 (direct quote). Let\u2019s just go to a vote. Stick to the facts presented in the proposal.

Your conspiracy theory about me forming conspiracy theories would make total sense\u2026 if what I said hadn\u2019t been true. If you knew how tech businesses worked, you\u2019d know that Dharma stands to greatly benefit from this airdrop. Generating this kind of good will could provide user retention & reactivation benefits that far outweigh even the value of the airdrop itself. Active users will be more likely to build a stronger relationship with Dharma as a result of this \u201cbattle\u201d that they\u2019ve engaged in to win wealth for their users. The stories that will be told after this magnificent war will rival those told about King Arthur and Excalibur. Dharma has been around for a while, and likely has a number of lapsed users. Companies are constantly trying to figure out how to reactivate users who have stopped using their product. An airdrop is a wonderful way to bring people back to the product after having stopped using it for months or years. Once there are more active users, the valuation on the company magically goes up. Because of this, Dharma\u2019s investors would love to see the airdrop happen. These are not conspiracy theories. This is how technology businesses work. Sadly, none of this even matters because Dharma and it\u2019s powerful associates have more than enough voting power to vote this into reality without any of the community being necessary. Including you, @monet-supply. Your role as a delegate is absolutely meaningless in this context. Sure, they\u2019ll let other delegates vote in favor of the proposal and feel like they are playing a major role. But it\u2019s simply platitudes. If they want to win, they can win. They have the votes. Is that what you signed up for? If yes, then you can go ahead and support this plan. But if you believe that users such as you and I should be able to play some role in what this governance system will look like over the coming months and years, then the time to push back on these kind of governance takeovers - the kind that allows ten whales to override the will of thousands of users. By the way, I make about $175/month off YouTube ads and not much else. Thanks for reminding me of how little money I have right now. Cheers. ",

(Fwiw, I don\u2019t think Dex aggregator users do) Even though airdropping is an inefficient way of UNI distribution in the vacuum, it does make sense to reward users evenly. == On a side note, I think Dharma does a poor job of signaling its stances, intentions, and actions. If more transparency were to be brought, the communication would get much easier. For example, instead of telling people that the votes were delegated, Dharma can simply let the community know the number of votes that it delegated to itself. ",

There is a fine line between criticizing someone\u2019s ideas and not their person, and i always try to remain on the correct side. I respect the fact that you are empowering our community with the tools to navigate this crazy, and ludicrously risky, DeFi space. I also acknowledge that you aren\u2019t becoming fabulously wealth doing so. Despite how much i cringe hearing your philosophical stance at times, i do find myself enjoying the content you provide. (advice: i think the 60 sec countdown timer is a tad long - once yes - every time?)     chrisblec:  If you knew how tech businesses worked, you\u2019d know that Dharma stands to greatly benefit from this airdrop.   Yes! and Yes! I\u2019ve worked in Tech for 20 years. From large (Accenture) to medium (Logitech / Kobo) to extremely small startups (20 ppl or less). Account acquisition and retention killed a few of those initiatives and people went home without jobs eventually. I understand what \u2018sweat equity\u2019 feels like as i coerced a team of friends to work on a gaming company for 1 year, before giving up. The user is all that matters in today\u2019s world.     chrisblec:  These are not conspiracy theories. This is how technology businesses work.   I get it. Painfully so. In fact, executive teams are starting to rethink organizational behaviour, and corporate strategy in this new world. This idea that we have to moat ourselves off from the competition and live in our walled garden, is dying. MBAs no longer drive strategy with their tired conventional roadmaps. Execs are now building and developing eco-systems, because they understand that a strong community of partners leads to greater success for themselves. In this strategic model, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Crypto partially grew out of a disenfranchisement with traditional approaches to financial and social governance, and the irony is that many of us have dug in so deeply we are unable to see the non-crypto space shifting dramatically around us. Crypto/blockchain tech has less than 1% adoption worldwide. If we cannibalize ourselves, we will struggle to achieve coherence. If instead we treat this as a broader community, and without all the enmity, we have something more noble to work on. Dharma is a partner, a friend, not a self-serving VC backed whale. If you want to know what a whale looks like, just watch what FB does with Libra, or Google when they start bulldozing this space like a bull in a china shop. We\u2019ll be scrambling to make friends then.     chrisblec:  Sadly, none of this even matters because Dharma and it\u2019s powerful associates have more than enough voting power to vote this into reality without any of the community being necessary.   We have to be careful with this logic. If you have at least 1 UNI, are you not part of the community? So, if you have 1 Million UNI, does it not retain your community status? And, what court or what type of governance is going to \u2018flip\u2019 your switch from community member to whale? Where is the threshold? If you happen to acquire 10 Million delegated UNI, should we not flip your switch to \u2018whale\u2019 then and by the same logic? These are ideological concerns that we often forget to consider, especially when our own solutions force us to violate those ideals. You see, the rush to diminish power requires us to grab that same power to make it an even fight. History is littered with examples to illustrate why that never works. Appeals to \u201cwell\u2026 i will govern by the grace and will of the people!\u201d are a historical cliche. It doesn\u2019t mean you should not run as delegate, or be wildly successful at it. It only prompts an inner dialog around the contradictions between \u2018means\u2019 and \u2018ends\u2019 that every leader faces. ",

We\u2019ll be scrambling to make friends then.   This is where we differ in our thinking. Every company operating in DeFi, including Dharma, puts their business survival ahead of principles of decentralization\u2026 as they should! A smart business will scrape & claw at whatever is necessary to be able to survive\u2026 whether it\u2019s grabbing power to vote for an airdrop to its users, or soliciting support from its investors & strategic partners to be able to do so. This is not a bad thing for business. However, this fact should preclude any of these businesses from being trusted in a \u201cdecentralized\u201d governance setting. Not just UNI governance, but any governance claiming to be decentralized. ",

Decentralization should be very uncomfortable. Businesses will always find it extremely difficult or impossible to operate in a truly decentralized way. That is by design.

Consider the impact of dark money in the American political system. We have the (potential) ability to be radically transparent in our governance. Why shy away from exercising it? @chrisblec \u2013 please source this \u201cdiscovery\u201d.  Is there any indication of who owns the addresses that comprise the 98%? @nadav_dharma, @brendan_dharma: as the folks behind the delegation, where is Dharma\u2019s vote count coming from? Unfortunately, DAO governance such as it exists now is inherently plutocratic. While unique voter totals are useful in informing us on user sentiment, it is the richest holders who have the most impact. I find the argument that Dharma has \u201cthe most\u201d unique users after Univalent or Gauntlet\u2026 to be less than compelling. We have 3 large delegations. So, of those, it\u2019s the least decentralized both in user count, and apparently, in composition (viz a viz 4 addresses with 98% of UNI). Again, I\u2019m interested to see some sources for these claims. I\u2019ll look to spin up a Dune dashboard when I get some spare time. ",

Not the end user.   As far as I know an account cannot have its owned UNI automatically delegated to anyone. The delegation records are stored within the Uniswap token contract and they are per account and can only be entered by account address owners. The delegation information is not made or stored within tokens themselves in any capacity. Specifically, in terms of DeFi Saver, for example, the Smart Wallet (or DSProxy) is a proxy smart contract wallet that is solely owned and managed by the account that created it. No one could affect the delegation of any tokens potentially owned by the Smart Wallet except the account that owns the Smart Wallet. (And just to further clarify if potentially needed, one account can only have one Smart Wallet / DSProxy associated with it.) ",

He\u2019s a developer, and i learned a lot about governance mechanics listening to him. he was a joy to watch, because despite his self-restraint, the transparency with all the head shaking and eye rolling was reassuring - it confirmed his humanity.  don\u2019t deny it! cComp was faceless, so it was really hard to read his body language (80% of human communication). he sounded thoughtful and measured, however, trying to catch Nadav repeatedly in a logical/semantic trap by getting him to admit that he was going to abandon his users if the vote failed\u2026 well. i\u2019m pretty sure for all of Nadav\u2019s faults, lacking empathy for his users wouldn\u2019t be among my chief worries. Nadav looked like he was either operating in his bedroom or in a hotel. wearing a plain t-shirt over a chiseled chest to match his expertly refined scalp, painted quite the picture. anyway, it was the furthest from vc backed affluence seeking to manipulate governance in a get rich quick scheme. maybe he\u2019s the world\u2019s  greatest thespian, but all i saw was authenticity, genuine frustration, and a real fear that his users will abandon his team\u2019s product - which i\u2019m sure they have considered a labour of love for some years (3 rounds of investment!). i agree with his sentiment that 6 weeks of merri-go-round discussion is sufficiently beyond \u201cdue dilligence\u201d and precariously close to \u201cnow we are just spinning endlessly\u201d. let\u2019s reframe the proposal to address all concerns and then let\u2019s vote. more importantly, it sounded like fierce conversation and dialog. stressful at times, but necessary to drive towards compromise. perfect alignment is never achievable of course, but aligning \u2018for now\u2019 is infinitely better than the alternatives. a proven ability to navigate the unknown is essential. a proven ability to avoid conflict is a recipe for failure. now that everyone is in the vicinity of agreement, let\u2019s move forward productively and accept the outcome as a DAO - a DAO that functions a tad bit better today than it did some hours ago.  proud of you guys, and happy to be among this great community ",

If there are ~1,000 participants that put in on average ~10 hours reading/thinking/talking/debating this, and their time is worth on average ~$100/h, then so far this proposal has cost the community $1M. In this specific case, the outcome is also fairly zero-sum, in that 1) it doesn\u2019t create any wealth for UNI holders, it 2) takes UNI from the treasury that could be spent on other things, and 3) gives it to folks who will likely sell it, probably having a small negative price impact. I\u2019m inclined to vote NO, mostly selfishly, but also because I think \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d is basically the absolute worst possible norm to set in governance. The obvious failure mode to avoid is UNI holders voting to give themselves the remaining UNI treasury (or alternatively, giving it only to those who vote YES). However, if we vote NO, there\u2019s basically nothing stopping Dharma from continuing to do propose this, just like how Polkadot shills tried to infiltrate Ethereum governance [LINK BELOW] to pass EIP999 and recover the $100M+ they got stuck. And given that Dharma has $15M on the line\u2026 ugh. So here\u2019s my compromise proposal. I will vote YES (and encourage others to do the same) if and only if: THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE LAST FUND RECOVERY EVER. What I want to see is basically everyone who is in support of this proposal also promise that they will never support another retroactive UNI distribution for as long as they live (and hold UNI). That doesn\u2019t mean abstaining on some future redistribution, that means actively assembling the squad and shooting that shit down. If the supporters of this proposal and the community can rally to establish the norm of NO MORE RETROACTIVE UNI DISTRIBUTION, then I think this proposal is not as bad. If not enough of the supporters of this proposal signal as I described above, I will vote NO and encourage everyone else to do so as well, EVERY SINGLE TIME THIS PROPOSAL COMES UP, until Dharma gives up. I\u2019ve spent more time than I care to admit fighting ProgPOW exactly because it\u2019s a zero-sum redistribution of wealth that favors special interests, and because if that shit passes it will erode my and many other ETH stakeholders\u2019 faith in ETH governance as it would demonstrate to us that the core devs are captured. Let\u2019s try to avoid these kinds of governance quagmires for Uniswap. I\u2019ll conclude by saying that I think the Dharma squad is chill and has good ETH vibes, so if we can get norm right they are probably at the top of the list in terms of being aligned community members. There could be much worse potential recipients for this grant. [LINK] twitter .com /rzurrer/status/1103627204250877953 ",

An example of zero-sum distribution would be if someone would suggest giving extra 100 UNI to all the users who already received 400 UNI. And this would be a completely different proposal, as it would create a direct financial incentive to vote for it for 73 million UNI. Do you see any proposal of this kind in the governance forum? Zero-sum implies that one group is getting advantage of the others while providing nothing in return. So theoretically people who received the initial airdrop could try to hijack the governance treasury and distribute it towards themselves continually. Zero-sum proposals are pretty straight forward: it only makes sense to vote for them if you directly benefit from them. The phase 1 proposal can only pass if a lot of UNI token holders who don\u2019t directly benefit from it make it pass. ",

Fairness tends to be viewed as a binary thing. If the proposal fails, part of the community will consider that another part of the community was mistreated. If the proposal passes, I doubt that many people will feel that initial distribution to past users was unfair. So we can acquire community consensus on a fundamental matter here. == You prefer a model where past users are rewarded unevenly; I prefer the model where they\u2019re rewarded evenly. Either way, it is a tough sell that uneven rewards are substantially fairer than even rewards. Still, in your uneven reward model, there is a reason why some users get more UNI than others: due to being early birds or active users. Even distribution already happened, it is not in discussion. What\u2019s the reason behind not completing it?     jernejml:  You are are also mixing up addresses with users   Addresses are the closest thing to users we can get on Ethereum. I don\u2019t know of a better way to reward past users than to reward addresses.     jernejml:  In the end, airdrop was defensive move + money grab for devs.   It is beyond my comprehension how the most generous value distribution in cryptocurrency history still can be viewed as a money grab.     jernejml:  My point being, forget about fairness.   Why should we forget about fairness? Is it because you think there was a better way to reward past users? Or is it because you devalue what the Uniswap team did by marking it as a money grab and defensive move? Given that UNI holders\u2019 main job is to distribute governance treasury, I believe keeping fairness in mind is one of the most important things. ",

It is possible to mitigate this downside, you could use Sablier or Superfluid and have the UNI gradually streamed over a period of time (e.g. 1 year) to reduce the chance of an immediate negative price impact - although you do run the risk where everyone just waits until the streaming of UNI is finished to sell. A combination of that along with being able to delegate / vote with both a.) The UNI which will be received in the future & b.) The UNI already received, would be great as it:  Reduce the chance of immediate negative price impact Allows for the participation of Dharma UniSwap users in the UNI governance who missed the initial airdrop The Dharma users will still gain all of their entitled UNI  Only negative is the Dharma users will have to wait a period of time to sell all of it although if you ask those who sold UNI sub $3 valuation maybe they wish they had their UNI locked up at the start of the UNI distribution too  ",

I even explored dharma myself, but more importantly pointed a handful of good friends towards dharma for its ease of use.  They used dharma precisely because a MetaMask walkthrough was not to be bothered with at the time.  These friends leveraged dharma to swap and engage in the ecosystem that we see thriving today.  Many of these friends were early users of uniswap whether they realized or not. Odd to me to play king maker with uni based on brand of wallet\u2026when we were making the same trades on different platforms\u2026maybe not odd to you but odd to me\u2026yes yes I understand the reasoning why wallets like theirs were excluded originally\u2026better than most I am sure from reading these 100+ comments.  But fees all fund the system all the same\u2026their transactions are sprinkled all through what has become such a remarkable success story. For me it\u2019s about my fiends, Ty, Dave and Rob, who told countless people about there experience with Dharma that also always ended up being a story about uniswap.  In all fairness, since fairness is a common thread in so many of the \u201cno\u201d signals\u2026 if you knew how much UNI someone like me earned from the LP drop\u2026you\u2019d be putting a proposal together to strip me of my UNI because who the f&ck am I to deserve such bounty.  Well I was early like many of you and like my buddies. Appreciate all the yes and no signals, I really do.   Also, a hard no on phase 2 for many reasons suggested. Final thought, if you participate on compound you already know Dharma to be active and an engaged steward in governance.  Which is valuable. ",

Isn\u2019t this the whole idea of decentralized governance? I hope UNI holders can see beyond simplistic arguments made to stir up emotions. (Also what the hell with all these ad hominem?) You are against this proposal because of VC involvement? Vote No. You are against this proposal because of potential dilution? Vote No. You are against this proposal because this might increase Dharma retention rate? Isn\u2019t that good for Uniswap? More users == more fees == more potential upside for UNI holders. I am a UNI holder and I will vote yes to this Phase1 proposal. I believe allocation UNI to those users who have used Uniswap through app integration is good for the future of Uniswap. Thank you @brendan_dharma and everyone who has worked hard to gather the data and create this proposal. You disagree with me? Vote No. ",

It did that for folks who were never going to be Web3ing it up on Toshi, or MetaMask. My world and view in this is small, I know this.

There were ~48M eligible votes on Proposal #1, and ~80M eligible votes on Proposal #2. Which curiously enough, the additional number of UNI delegated between the two proposals (32M), roughly matches the number of uncast votes excl.

I suppose in Univalent\u2019s case they were really only positioning themselves as a delegate to be able to pass proposal #1, but even so it would be a better outcome for them to ask to be \u2018undelegated\u2019 or to delegate to another voter than to abstain.

I trade everyday all day and this is what I do\u2026 look back at my prior messages, I said this would happen\u2026 now that UNI is on coinbase\u2026 more people see what\u2019s going on with uni and this is bad news on your first impression\u2026 @samscalet We because I am still averaging down at the moment, Need to find a better system that works when we send something for a vote. We need to focus on one item at a time, get it passed and move on. How about we do a pre-vote on stuff, get the details worked out first like the senate does.We should build it together with everyones feed back provided during the construction of it, that way we can stand solid enough to pass a bill. At least people can see the benefits of what the proposal can do for UNI growth etc. Just my opinion. We gotta do better, and just like any business\u2026 You can have a good or the best product, but it won\u2019t matter if the people in business aren\u2019t working together.

Looking at the date of this proposal I realize that I\u2019m late to the vote.  That said,  I have some things to say and am going to say them.   Uniswap Governance token is reflective of a \u2018Pay-to-Play\u2019 model.   I earned my UNI through purchase from exchange and some free from airdrop.  I own few, but they are mine.  Uniswap has provided me a platform to raise myself out of poverty.  I am one on those that has been greatly effected from COVID-19 in regards to employment.   This looks like a \u2018giveaway\u2019 that is not beneficial to UNI token holders.  What is Uniswap?  Is it a non profit?!  This is partly a serious question I want you all to ask yourself.  I use Uniswap to partially receive income.   If this is also you then this is not to your benefit.  This is an intentional hemorrhage on Uniswap\u2019s treasury.  While I\u2019ve appreciated Uniswap\u2019s generosity in assisting other projects (ie Sushiswap,   I am new to Uniswap\u2019s Governance,  but by no means new to Uniswap.  I love Uniswap for its fair launch for what it has accomplished in the last year is nothing short of a miracle of developer ingenuity.  Let\u2019s not to mention all the Uniswap LPs.   Is Dharma a competitor?  If it is,  that is dilution of value of the UNI token.   The token I feel is being bleed of its value that UNI LPs worked hard to give it its value.  My fear is user flight from Uniswap to other projects because its token and yields become less competitive.  Sure, you can be loyal to a project for other reasons that our not financial;  though I\u2019d argue that this is financial in essence and the tight community is held together by fair, equitable profiting for all.   Measures to Uniswap need to ideally be benificial to Uniswap and its token holders.  Many of the proposals propose divestment from Uniswap.  This is concerning.  We should vote to better fine tune Uniswap.  I noticed several copycat exchanges that add/subtract minor value.  We don\u2019t need more Unis, we need a harder, better, stronger Uniswap\ud83e\udd84   I hope this did not pass.  I\u2019m a Dharma end user and still don\u2019t want token transfer dilution on projects like UNI.  Uniswap needs Whale-free laws and UNI Token Caps on airdrops and UNI Token % Data. ",
