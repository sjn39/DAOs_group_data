Binance Smart Chain The bridged Dai total on BSC has remained largely unchanged, though the majority is held by the Binance EX rather than a yield farming platform.   74.15% of bridged Dai is held in Binance hot wallets.   8.54% is stored in the Venus smart contract as vDAI.    Fantom  91.09% of Dai bridged to Fantom is held in a Curve contract.   Klaytn  Around 86.95% of Dai bridged to Klaytn is held on KlaySwap.   Polygon  1036\u00d7371 21.7 KB  Special thanks to @SebVentures. Bookmark his database for accurate, easy-to-read tracking for Maker analytics of all kinds. Dai usage on Polygon has risen from around 418 million DAI to over 567 million, peaking at 652.9 million DAI. The majority is held in two pools:   Iron Finance | Re-launch Roadmap   Aave   Iron Finance identifies as a \u201cpartially collateralized algorithmic stablecoin\u201d and operates on the BSC and Polygon chains. The project made headlines earlier this year after its stablecoin (IRON) fell off its dollar peg and its governance token (TITAN) fell to near zero. This represents a relaunch of the same, with alterations made to its protocol. It has yet to go live, but its contract is the largest Dai holder on the Polygon network at over 36.2% of the market share - or over $205 million in DAI. The spike in bridged Dai began in early July and peaked on the 15th.  1341\u00d7523 21.1 KB   Iron Finance rose to over 48% of Dai\u2019s market share on Polygon, but has since since evened out with Aave. Aave wallets hold the second highest Dai total, amounting to 34.1% of Dai bridged to the Polygon network - or around $185 million in DAI. Aave was last week\u2019s Polygon majority holder with over 51% of the network\u2019s Dai market share, but additional Dai has been bridged, and funds have been removed from Aave and placed in Iron LPs.  1338\u00d7445 25.5 KB   Aave\u2019s Market share fell drastically mid-week, but has since recovered.  Overview  919\u00d7375 48 KB  Layer-2s still only represent a small portion of the total Dai supply.  Thoughts? Have anything you\u2019d like to see added to these breakdowns?
