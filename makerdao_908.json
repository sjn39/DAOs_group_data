DAI however has not grown at the same pace as USDT and USDC have despite...  Reading time: 2 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 22 \u2764       As we can see from the post, Curve is no longer looking to promote 3pool, because of the problems associated with how far we lagged in growth against USDC and USDT. In addition to the rapid evolution of UST, FRAX and MIM, which are controversial projects, but which are there. They talk about PSM and the problem it poses for the use of curve DAI. ",

Also interesting Maker\u2019s own monet-supply in there pushing USDP and GUSD. \u201cIMO a USDC/USDP/GUSD metapool would be a valuable addition\u201d. Looks to me like a general moving away from DAI by various communities for varying reasons mostly confirming what I have been seeing in DAI trading for quite a while now.   Decreasing fees in Token-DAI pairs due to lower DAI trading volumes.  USDC by far more popular than DAI and USDT - well is always USDT\u2026 What I am trying to figure out is how anyone got the perception of Maker shitting on curve? ",

                    "content": "A perfectly rational choice for Curve with the bribe ecosystem. The bigger news is the 4pool with tighter integration of FRAX, and UST. Lots of projects bribe to get incentivized by Curve and DAI gets a free ride with more TVL. And you have a highly liquid 3pool, but the DAI isn\u2019t used as often for trading compared to the popular USDC/USDT. Really we can\u2019t expect to eat our cake and have it too, PSM for low slippage trades, and curve adoption for more TVL. Now, there will be some consequences for DAI but not that big of a deal. TVL - Yes, there\u2019ll be lower TVL but it\u2019s not the biggest problem for DAI because we have too much TVL currently. If it becomes a problem, the PSMs will run out of reserves and we\u2019ll have to raise stability fees and the DSR. DAI trading - 3pool will be smaller. There\u2019s some competing dexes like Balancer and UNI-V2. These can provide some liquidity and trading venues in the case DAI goes off peg. There\u2019ll be less buffer but it just means Maker needs to be more proactive in an off peg event. We have the PSM still for normal trading times. (Also, 3pool will probably have similar DAI volume even with lower TVL, bigger liquidity pools have diminishing returns at some point) PSM - Doo raised the point of raising fees on the PSM to capture some revenue now that there\u2019s less competition. The PSM reserves are also not that resilient in the case of an off-peg situation. Maybe we want more flexibility when deploying reserves to defend the peg. TL:DR A perfectly rational decision for Curve. Though of course it would\u2019ve been ideologically better if they kept 3pool as the main trading pair. Overall, MakerDAO will survive with lower demand for DAI and less liquidity. ",

In fact, isn\u2019t Maker protocol integrating Curve LP as collateral?   Yes, the sentiment there is surprising because I haven\u2019t seen anyone speaking negatively about Curve. Plus, as pointed out, we accept CRV LP tokens as collateral. Add onto the fact that the demand is so high that it\u2019s nearly reached max utilization and requires an increase. Regardless, they make a fair point about the comparative lack of growth, as many of us agreed through numerous discussions or threads about stopping the burn and aggressive expansion. While these proposals don\u2019t pose a considerable risk to us, I\u2019m in the mindset to foster more collaboration and ecosystem growth. I think our CUs should connect with the Curve team and see how we can alleviate their growth concerns\u2014perhaps adding more CRV LP tokens like CRV-ETH-STETH or supporting other crypto collaterals they can utilize. Let\u2019s clarify why they should prioritize DAI, the best decentralized stablecoin. ",
