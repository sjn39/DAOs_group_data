Here are some comments; This should be positioned as an \u201cERC\u201d (but still would go through the EIP process). \u201cSimple Summary\u201d - After the description of what flash loans are, this section needs more of a summary of the ERC itself. \u201cMotivation\u201d - Links to documentation of AAVE, DxDy, Yield\u2019s flash loan interfaces would be helpful here. Also, it could start w/ a more general description of the technical reason the interface is needed in order for a flash loan to function. \u201cRationale\u201d - This should start w/ a general rationale about why the ERC is needed w/ its general approach, etc. The rationales for each of the methods are still useful though. Hope this helps! ",

Why not allow the caller to decide the callback and provide all of the parameters?  They already can query for fee, and the amount being loaned is known to the caller in advance of the call.  So you could just do receiver.call(_calldata) which would allow the caller to also decide what method was called. ",
