                    "content": "Authors: @Aes, @hexonaut Contributors: @juanbug This Signal Request allows the Maker community to signal if it wants to launch Maker Teleport with a 1 basis point fee. Maker Teleport, formerly known as Maker Wormhole, will launch with some key advantages over other bridge offerings.  Teleport allows users to withdraw L2 funds near instantly by avoiding the need to wait for fraud proofs Teleport burns DAI on the origin chain and mints DAI on the destination chain without the need for any centralized party or liquidity pools that are seen by hackers as a honeypot  As a result, Maker Teleport will launch being both faster and safer than current competitive offerings. Strategic Finance has researched bridge offerings across the ecosystem and found that even launching with a 1 basis point fee, Maker Teleport is estimated to be 75-99% cheaper than other bridge products. Though 1 basis point may seem insignificant, we strongly believe that bridging is a subset of web3 that will show strong secular growth and likely have significantly lower correlation and possibly even negative correlation to the protocol\u2019s core business, creating a new and extremely valuable revenue stream for the protocol. While the current plan is to launch Maker Teleport with only DAI, we could potentially expand our offering to include PSM stablecoins. Some of the larger bridges are already earning over $2.1M/month in fees, and while Multichain is covering many more chains and crypto-assets, it\u2019s quite clear that stablecoins are the most bridged asset and will likely continue to be long-term. Teleport Fee Parameters per Domain: Set the Arbitrum Wormhole Fee parameter to 1 bp Set the Optimism Wormhole Fee parameter to 1 bp    Should Maker Teleport launch with a fee?  Yes - Launch with 1 basis point fee No - Launch with no fee Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will end on 2022-05-19T00:00:00Z, and if positive, will move on-chain on the following Monday.

This is because it simultaneously capitalizes on inter-op while catering to and directly addressing the weaknesses of trusted honeypot bridges. I like the move towards a nominal fee. Maker creates valuable products that the market needs and will be happy to pay for. To charge appropriately for such products is to fund the pace of R&D required to keep trailblazing the frontier. To @hexonaut\u2019s point, anchoring is critical here. If we are providing a cross-chain highway, users should expect to pay a toll, however small. Politically a nightmare to open a free road and then install a toll booth later. The toll should be priced in a way that drives customer acquisition and promotes lock-in/loyalty. Then, should the DAO seek to mirror standard for-profit business practice, ultimately lean in to pricing power. Recent events in stablecoin (UST) and bridge land (Wormhole, Ronin) have rudely reminded users how critical robust architecture and conservatism are. There\u2019s arguably no better time to launch and charge for an MKR-branded product that\u2019s damn good. ",

May not be entirely relevant (I frankly know too little about the bridge market), but here they are: a) What is the expected competitor reaction set? On the surface one could assume the competitors would set fee at zero for DAI to retain customer relationships, volumes and make their money on other chains and assets? If so, then is there value in starting at 1 bps? Is \u201cstory value\u201d of 0 Bps better? And would \u201cstart at 1bps\u201d and move to 0bps erode such story value? Also if the competitors do set their fee to zero, then will customers move? Or remain with existing for convenience? b) What is the most valuable story to tell the market for Maker right now that aligns with Maker strategy? 0 bps \u2192 For instance something like: \u201cMaker constantly working to make DAI as friction-free as possible: teleport DAI freely\u201d (or something much more clever that is relevant for the potential customers) ? 1 bps \u2192 For instance something like: \u201cMaker charge 1 bps and use it to protect your teleportation the following way: something something\u201d - it is always good give customers logical reasons for a fee, that they can buy into and see some value/benefit in.

Or remain with existing for convenience? b) What is the most valuable story to tell the market for Maker right now that aligns with Maker strategy? 0 bps \u2192 For instance something like: \u201cMaker constantly working to make DAI as friction-free as possible: teleport DAI freely\u201d (or something much more clever that is relevant for the potential customers) ? 1 bps \u2192 For instance something like: \u201cMaker charge 1 bps and use it to protect your teleportation the following way: something something\u201d - it is always good give customers logical reasons for a fee, that they can buy into and see some value/benefit in.   Begs a general question of whether we can have something between 0bps and 1bps? One point here with respect to fee and competition. As one who has been a long time arbitrage user there is a few things to consider.  Bridges are significant attack surfaces.   Money has been lost in bridges. Take 1/2 the fee specified and create wormhole insurance fund (what cases this insurance will cover will need to be specified, but in the end it should be clearly stated - up to Maker Governance IN ALL cases whether to pay out or NOT).   Using the fee to generate an insurance fund I think people will look upon favorably. wormhole performance.   IF I can beat an arbitrager to a trade - and this makes me money - then I will pay a fee. Being able to adjust the fee to like .12bps vs. 1.22bps I think has some use with respect to competition. I tend to trust Maker PECU much more than other dev groups.   Provided performance is competitive I am going to pay a fee.  To put this in perspective.  100M across such a bridge at 1bps would cost 10,000.   Which begs another question.  Is there some way to set a fee based on the size of the tx.  say tx\u2019s over 1M get .15bps, under 1M .35bps?  I believe fees for services to be important but I think understanding competition is also important I think performance metrics would be useful.   Support to people explaining why 10000 DAI wormhole move cost them .35DAI may be important\u2026  But when I put this all in context of fees to do these moves I have to wonder if the tx cost me 20 am I going to care if I pay .35 or 1.35 in wormhole fees?   But if this becomes 10,000 to more 100M when the tx cost $200 might be a little stiff. ",

                    "content": "Just want to provide some additional data and context to this post. When creating our own bridge, it\u2019s essential to understand the competitors in the space. Here\u2019s an analysis of the most prominent players in the space as well as the native bridges for the L2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism. L2 Native Bridges: Arbitrum and Optimism Something we often see with a native bridge is a costless transaction to onboard onto that chain and then a hefty fee on the way back, often coupled with multiple days of waiting. This is also apparent with the Optimism and Arbitrum native bridges. Bridging from Mainnet to the L2 is costless aside from an ethereum gas transaction and takes about 10 minutes. Going the other way, we see that on Arbitrum, the transaction will take 7 days to bridge fully. For Optimism, this is 8 days. Additionally, it costs another ethereum gas transaction to actually send the token to your balance once they are transferred. In crypto, the saying \u201ctime is money\u201d is even more apparent as any time waiting for a bridge to finish is time lost from generating passive yields. Assuming a relatively conservative 10% yield for stablecoin investments in Defi, this week-long waiting process directly correlates to ~20bps of lost yields, which can be thought of effectively as an upfront bridging fee. \"Fast\" Third Party Bridges Going from Mainnet to L2 (~5-10 minutes to bridge):   Multichain: $0.90 base fee   Synapse: Minimum 8 bps of fees, additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive slippage possible, quite rare)   Stargate: Minimum 6 bps of fees, additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive NOT slippage possible)   Hop: Minimum 6 bps of fees, additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 30+ bps extra. (positive slippage is NOT possible)   Celar: Minimum 4 bps of fees, additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive slippage is NOT possible)   Going from L2 to Mainnet (~5-30 minutes to bridge):   Multichain: $40 base fee, plus 10 bps (maximum of $1000 per bridge)   Synapse: $60 base fee, plus 8 bps, plus additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive slippage possible, quite rare)   Stargate: ~$50 base fee, plus 6 bps, plus additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive slippage is NOT possible)   Hop: $50 base fee, plus 6 bps, plus additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 30+ bps extra. (positive slippage is NOT possible)   Celar: $50 base fee, plus 4 bps, plus additional slippage based on the liquidity of the starting and destination chains, at times 10+ bps extra. (positive slippage is NOT possible)   It\u2019s important to note that there needs to be sufficient liquidity on the destination chain to complete the bridge for all third party bridges, or else there will be no tokens to redeem once the bridging has finished. Maker Teleport Bridge Our proposed 1bps flat fee for all bridges is advantageous for the end-user in mostly every situation aside from a few edge cases. Compared to third-party \u201cfast\u201d bridges, Teleport will be even faster, with near-instant bridging capabilities. Further, the flat 1 bps fee is >75% cheaper than other bridges. The story is much the same when comparing to native bridges. We believe the ability to now bridge fully composable DAI to these L2s instead of creating a wrapped version on the destination chain, leaving the bridge contractors susceptible to malicious hackers, offsets the 1 bps fee. Further, on the way back to mainnet, the saved week-long wait can be equated to 20 bps of lost yields, something that could have been earned with an instant bridge charging only 1 bps. ",

This was originally part of some private negotiations, but it\u2019s become clear now that this is no longer important. Stablecoins are likely to be the vast majority of cross-chain transfers. This is great, but due to our permissionless PSMs it actually allows other stablecoins to use our system without paying or promoting Maker / DAI as the back-end. Ideally we would like to be able to charge only other stablecoins for using our system, but there is no way to do this without charging for DAI transfers as well unless we turn on the fees for PSMs (which I am against as this is very bad for RWA borrowers). I think as long as we are the most competitive we should be able to charge a small fee. If it later becomes clear that this is not optimal then we can lower it. Long term when we solve USD redeem-ability for DAI directly we can shift the fees to the PSMs and make DAI free. ",

Based on what I\u2019ve read about DeFi yield farming, it seems like users are very sensitive to fees/returns and move capital quickly in response to incentives. With a 1bps fee, it sounds like we\u2019re drastically undercutting the market and creating a significant incentive that we expect users to respond to. Have we seen users being responsive to pricing changes (if any) with existing bridges? If we don\u2019t make Teleport free now, I think that we should revisit making Teleport free in the future once we have a better sense of market appetite. If we think that bridges will go through a growth phase where they exponentially increase in usage in the future, we want to be positioned as the obvious, easy, default option before that growth trajectory launches (cross-reference Allan\u2019s comment\u2019s on the story we tell). The only way to do that is to be free. Put another way, if we think the raw total addressable market here will be huge someday, it seems relatively cheap to go all-in here and get exposure to potential asymmetrically large upside. ",

This is DeFi and fortunately there is no such thing as vendor lock. If volume starts routing elsewhere we can lower the fees then and pick up the volume again immediately. Much like we can get the bulk of ETH and WBTC market share just by undercutting the competition, but not free we should do the same here. ",

This business is unfortunately susceptible to the vagaries of macro cycles. At the moment, even as rates rise elsewhere, crypto lending is facing an environment of compressed yields as capital rotates out of the asset class. We don\u2019t have a business on 3. yet as we do not have proprietary positions and likely will never offer brokerage services. The only remaining lever for growth that we have left is 2. Over time competition may well push it to 0. But until it does, there is no benefit (not even marketing benefit) to writing off completely the capital investment and ongoing maintenance that go into the bridge. Also, considering the compressing environment, do we really have the luxury to say no to revenue-generating opportunities? Especially when they stand to absorb a significant amount of bridge market share on a purely comparative basis alone (1bps is much much much lower than competitive bridges). As others have said before, you can make it go from 1 \u2192 0 much more easily than from 0 \u2192 1. Edit: changed a-> arrow to a \u2192 because of the existential pain ",
