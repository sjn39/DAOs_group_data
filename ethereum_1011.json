One thing you may establish is what triggers the progression through EIP statuses once it is set to DRAFT by the Editors.

Once in DRAFT the EIP can be updated a few times from feedback. Then have the signatories signal on Twitter when to move to LAST CALL. That allows one more opportunity to finalize the statement.

This EIP is so incredibly opposed by the Ethereum community, that people are rallying to communicate their discontent for it inside the EIP process. The overflow of resistance for this EIP is so large, that the dissenters are voicing their opinion inside Ethereum Magicians.

It says that, \"A stated goal of ProgPoW is to avoid contentious forks while transitioning to proof-of-stake\u2026\u201d But there is no such statement in the progPow proposal, and I don\u2019t recall this argument being raised in the Core Dev\u2019s initial deliberations. It says that, \"Later this year, Ethereum will begin to transition away from proof-of-work consensus towards proof-of-stake\u2026 \u201c which \u201c\u2026 introduces technical risk at a time when efforts and attention should be focused elsewhere.\u201d I submit that we do not know when proof-of-stake will happen, if ever.  Not every beginning leads to a successful ending. It says that. \"Some stakeholders have suggested that ProgPoW offers no clear benefit to Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and may centralize hashpower. There is no evidence that it will serve its intended purpose of better aligning miner incentives to disincentivize adversarial miner tactics.  Which stakeholders? Is a suggestion an argument? Have they looked for evidence? And is that the intended purpose?  What are the tactics? In between it talks a lot about the contention and division in the community, which are indubitally there, and a good reason to back off of progPoW.  Are their other ways past the contention?  If ASICs are indeed a security threat this can can\u2019t be kicked down the road forever. ",
