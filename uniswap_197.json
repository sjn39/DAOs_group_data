                    "content": "Dear Uniswap community, I\u2019d like to share with you our recent research around the Uniswap Fee Switch, i.e. the question whether a fraction of trading fees should go to the protocol and UNI token holders.   arXiv.org    The Economics of Automated Market Makers This paper studies the question whether automated market maker protocols such as Uniswap can sustainably retain a portion of their trading fees for the protocol. We approach the problem by modelling how to optimally choose a pool's take rate, i.e\\...      Some takeaways:  In a perfectly efficient market, the protocol with the lowest take rate (fraction of fees that goes to the protocol) attracts all liquidity. This is an argument against flipping the fee switch. In a market where a protocol like Uniswap has a \u201cmoat\u201d (due to its high profile and brand), the result is different: Assume Uniswap has a fraction of loyal (\u201csticky\u201d) trade volume, i.e. some users will always trade on Uniswap regardless of price, e.g. because they don\u2019t use or check other DEXs. According to our model, this competitive advantage makes it possible for Uniswap to sustainably introduce a non-zero take rate even when competing with zero take rate competitors. The model also gives some direction on how high to optimally set the take rate.  (Note that, as with every model, simplifying assumptions are made in the paper.) To be clear, this is not a recommendation for or against flipping the fee switch. Instead, we see this as a first step to providing a basis for making an informed decision whether and how to direct trading fees to the protocol. We hope our research can be helpful to the Uniswap community. If you have any feedback or suggestions for future research, feel free to reach out, also on Twitter https://twitter.com/robin_ethz. ",

                    "content": "I think you\u2019ve done a great job in modeling the basic formulas and dynamics around the fee switch. I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more comments on your work, perhaps you\u2019ve received them outside the forum. Reading your paper, everything ultimately depends on the values of sticky volumes s1, s2, and the LPs acceptable difference d. These are unknowns for Uniswap before trying out the fee switch in the open. Additionally, I consider d > 0 a fair assumption for practically all pools, since 1) Uniswap is the leader in market share 2) the contracts have been battletested with the most DEX volume. In terms of describing the real world, the weakness of the model is that it\u2019s fully static in terms of the total trade volume V. You have clearly stated this in the assumptions, but I\u2019d like to emphasize the significance of this on how the model behaves. It ultimately leads to the majority of conclusions from the model to be against the fee switch. The model basically tells how much volume Uniswap would lose by introducing take rates. What if the total volume would start to explode upwards? Particularly, I believe that activating the fee switch could supercharge Uniswap adoption by generating revenue to own UNI and making everyone more interested in the project. We are still in the early stages of growing what is possible \u201cthe orderbook of the world\u201d. Therefore, the model could be improved by adding a growth factor g > 0 that depends on the revenue generated to UNI holders. The factor g would affect the total trading volume V, creating a positive feedback loop effect. Then, in addition to the constant cash flow, we could add the future expected growth of the cash flow to the analysis and compare that against the costs now presented in the model (loss of volume/liquidity). Obviously, this would make the model more complicated but arguably a better one for real world decision making. But once more, really high quality work and a good starting point for further analysis.

I personally don\u2019t necessarily see the positive feedback loop you describe. Instead, considering future volume growth, could also lead to a result more critical of flipping the fee switch. Future volume could be less sticky than current volume, leading to lower sticky rates. Future trader and liquidity provider could be less loyal towards Uniswap (if some of the loyalty towards Uniswap stems from using it in the past). ",

What I\u2019m not a fan of  (pg. 3) What are the units for liquidity L1 and L2? Hopefully not TVL, since the analysis is on at least one concentrated AMM. I worry this detail might be especially relevant, since Uniswap\u2019s competitors have different AMM mechanisms. You justify this by saying that V3 is a CPMM for small price ranges, but it\u2019s important to take into account that the ratio of funds-to-depth is incomparable. I worry that the two-AMM model is a bit unfair in assuming L1+L2 is a constant, since there\u2019s obviously capital flight in times when yields on exchange 1 and 2 go down. Maybe this could be resolved by an alternative liquidity sink L3 whose return profile can be approximated as not depending on the amount of capital deployed to it, like some kind of DeFi risk-free-rate, and then assume that L1+L2+L3 is constant. Similar to (2), assumption that V is constant is surely false, however it may be fine if you constrained your analysis to talking about market share rather than market size, which seems to be what you\u2019re getting at here.  In aggregate, your assumptions are systematically biased in the direction of underestimating liquidity flight and volume flight that would occur upon introduction of a taker rate. What I\u2019m a fan of  Interestingly, due to the fact that each assumption seems to be in the direction of over-estimating optimal take rates, you might be able to use your results as an upper bound of optimal take rates. Your conclusion was perfectly modest, and it\u2019s worded so as to encourage future work. Love this. And the suggestion you give regarding game theory and the repeated taker rate game is excellent. While my intuition is that taker rates are an obvious race-to-the-bottom if there\u2019s 0 sticky liquidity, it\u2019s also obvious that 0 fees is not a Nash equilibrium when sticky liquidity does exist (no matter fees charged, multiply taker rate by the sticky volume and you\u2019re guaranteed to have more exchange revenue than with 0 taker rate). Would love to see (or do?) more research on the stage game and multi-game equilibria here. Beautiful graphs.  Overall I think it would be fruitful to reframe the conclusions to provide an upper bound on the exchange-revenue-maximizing taker rate, and I think there\u2019s a straightforward yet illuminating analysis that could be done on the game theory behind multi-stage exchange taker rate wars.
