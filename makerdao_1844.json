                    "content": "Hello, community. Here is the press release and letter from the (incubating) facilitator, for Maker Academy. We just finished an initial release of the product. Although 1) there are probably many small tweaks and bugs the team has not spotted and 2) the platform only accomplished 3% of the team\u2019s product vision\u2026we still think you will find it much more feature rich than other defi academies. Keep in mind, there are TONS of hidden features for users with higher permission levels, such as writing courses, articles, assessments, and even being able to submit edit requests on others\u2019 content. If you would like a higher permission level, please DM me.  Press Release  Maker Academy Launch Announcement \u2013 Press Release Following an incubation period under MakerDAO\u2019s Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES), the Maker Academy officially launched its website on X. The Maker Academy is the latest Core Unit servicing the Maker Protocol. The main focus of the Maker Academy will be on educating people about the various elements of Maker (both Protocol and DAO). Over the last few months, the Maker Academy was incubating under the SES core unit. Core units are self-sufficient teams that manage specific verticals within Maker. These individual units are headed by one or more Governance Facilitators. The SES core unit is responsible for identifying various opportunities for ecosystem scaling. The Maker Academy was created to help scale up the DAO with educated users by providing a purely learning platform. \u201cThe Maker Academy is your one-stop guide to all things Maker. Whether you\u2019re a new trying to understand how MakerDAO works or a contributor looking to help build, we\u2019ve got everything you need to get started,\u201d said Colby Anderson, the Facilitator and Head of the Maker Academy. \u201cCurrently, we have courses on the history of MakerDAO, the history of Maker Protocol, Maker Oracles, and Stablecoins. Stay tuned for more.\u201d While the Maker Academy has a team that will create the baseline courses for its students, anyone who is knowledgeable about the ecosystem will be able to contribute.  About Maker Academy Maker Academy increases the proficiency of current/potential MakerDAO contributors and justifies the public adoption of MakerDAO\u2019s products by facilitating the production of expert-curated content. The Maker Academy plans to educate all relevant audiences to MakerDAO ranging from end-users to laymen to contributors. Website: https://makerdao.academy/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakerAcademyCU  Letter From The Facilitator The Maker Academy has been a dream come true. It is so fulfilling to see something we have worked so hard on finally seeing the light of the day. I remember being instantly fascinated by MakerDAO and the possibilities of DeFi and a decentralized stablecoin. However, I saw a major problem as I began reading up on MakerDAO \u2013 there simply wasn\u2019t any ideal starting point or a recommended pathway to get to the goal that I wanted. That seemed very odd to me. This is one of the world\u2019s most important and game-changing protocols, yet why do I have to go to third-party sites to learn more about its technology? The worst part is that, more often than not, these third-party sites contained false and outdated information. Not to mention, these sites don\u2019t provide in-depth info and offer only the tip of the iceberg As I kept going in deeper, I realized that:  All the information available is very haphazard and unorganized. This is not exclusive to Maker, but that\u2019s not an excuse. The information that is available on third-party sites is not exactly in-depth and they are outdated. Many sites haven\u2019t even bothered updating their articles when DAI graduated from SAI to MCD! Any protocol that\u2019s governed by a DAO requires its token holders and other users that are somewhat educated about its technology and potential. This is why it is exponentially more important for Maker to have a powerful knowledge base. The Maker community is extremely passionate and generous with their knowledge and research in the forums. Why not give them a platform where they can share their knowledge in a readable and organized format? MakerDAO has several verticals. However, there is no tailored route of education for specific goals.  This was when I had the idea of a Maker Academy \u2013 a platform where not only can newbies gain in-depth knowledge about the various facets of MakerDAO and eventually contribute, but existing members can share their knowledge by becoming contributors. I shared the idea with the SES - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling \u2013 core unit and one of its leads Wouter Kampmann, and he quickly realized its value. For almost a year, the Maker Academy has been incubating under the aegis of the SES. As we kept working on the academy, we were baffled by the content opportunities because of the sheer scope of MakerDAO. Think about it, we have the governance aspect, the protocol itself, the potential of DeFi, and the potential of stablecoins all wrapped in one! Along the way, I also realized the value of having a common design framework for contributing educational pieces to the Maker Community. We already have the MIP format for various improvement proposals, so why not have something similar for our community to share their knowledge? I believe we can bridge this gap with a solution like Maker Academy. We realized that we needed to grow the team and hire folks who understood the scope and importance of the work. Over the last few months, the team has worked tirelessly, and I am super happy and proud to launch what we have today. Colby Anderson. Facilitator \u2013 Maker Academy. ",

From your message, you imply that we do the alternative - giving resources indirectly - and I\u2019m not sure what this means either.     iammeeoh:  What are opensource projects that have a structure like this `Maker Academy\u2019?   I would assume most defi academies have a similar structure. Many organizations in general (whether centralized or decentralized) fall into the category that this structure adheres to - creating a market\u2026not just serving consumers, but creating a place for producers and consumers to interact. I would also like to clarify that this diagram does not encapsulate the entire structure of Maker Academy, it just shows the content-creation side of what we do.     iammeeoh:  Why not use a combination of Wiki + StackExchange + Youtube (or others) + Khan Academy, etc without having \u201cMaker Academy\u201d in the middle, but rather on the side just transparently helping \u2018students\u2019 to interact with \u2018experts\u2019 ?   Please see my reply to to ultraschuppi as I think this will answer your question. ",

The quality control process is something we have struggled with. Since our existence has been somewhat unknown, and people are quite busy, we have not had as much time as we would have liked devoted to this or as many eyes as we would have liked. So far, the quality control process has been interal to the Maker Academy team. But, in the future, we plan to employ a few different measures to remedy this process:  having internal content developers speak in more generalities than specifics. Talking more about abstract principles that govern concretes, instead of the concretes themselves.  This attempts to solve the \u201coutdated\u201d issue. Having knowledgable users of the platform \u201cvet\u201d content, so average users can see what content has been \u201cvetted\u201d or not. But, again, quality control is tough to achieve in a silo. Hopefully, now with more eyes on the project, quality will improve.      Patrick_J:  This could potentially harm Governance as people may assume proposals have already passed and not realise there is still time for them to comment or vote.   Agreed. This should be made more clear.     Patrick_J:  Also, note it is no longer referred to as \u201cMATH\u201d in the proposal set.   Thank you for the clarification. ",

Juanbug:  If the project wasn\u2019t allocated 600,000 DAI, does it have the ability to draw upon that much?   This question is not specific to Maker Academy, but rather the incubation program as a whole. Usually the incubation program stipulates an initial set of contributors that they are willing to support (assuming the price for each contributor is around//below market-average). And, funding for other things (software licensing, etc) is negotiated on an ad hoc basis. But, again, best for SES to describe how their incubation program works, not me. If I had to ballpark it, I would estimate that Maker Academy has used around 300,000 DAI so far. But, again, I do not look at the invoices myself, SES does. I just based this on knowing team members salaries and how long we have had each team member. ",
