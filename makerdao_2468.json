In short, a PSM is very similar to using a stablecoin like USDC as collateral for Dai, except it enforces a price of 1 USDC per Dai directly in the market. This concept ultimately makes Dai significantly more liquid and stable. The results of this poll may affect the speed at which the PSM implementation will proceed through Governance. Given that this is a \u2018new\u2019 concept (despite the reuse of code from the Sai to Dai migration bridge implementation from the Multi Collateral Dai upgrade), it is vital to see a large majority of the Maker community in favour of implementing this as an expedited measure in order to pursue that path. Accordingly, this forum poll will allow the Maker community to signal their desired way forward for the PSM implementation timeline.  Should we implement the PSM, and if so, what process should we follow?     I don\u2019t want to see this implemented. I would like to see this implemented only using the MIPs process (longer-term implementation). I would like to see this implemented, but after a few weeks of discussion. I would like to see this implemented as soon as possible as an expedited measure.     0 voters     Notes:  The poll will be live for at least 24 hours but might be extended based on the results after the initial 24 hour period has passed. Regardless of the winning option here, the PSM will also be formalized as a MIP at a later date and proposed in the monthly governance cycle.  ",

                    "content": "I want to provide some data points that are relevant for the PSM poll. Recently in the Foundation we have been observing that integration partners in DeFi have been switching from Dai to USDC, or launching with USDC support instead of Dai, and it has in many cases been attributed directly to the peg. One example was the new gnosis prediction (omen.eth) market which had planned to use Dai, but felt forced to switch to USDC because the broken peg would mean an unacceptable user experience. There\u2019s also examples of distribution channels (wallets, exchanges) in South America that currently are Dai exclusive that are seriously considering switching to USDC because of the peg. This is all something that has been happening slowly ever since march 12 when the peg first broke, but recently it has been definitely been happening a lot more - given that it is accelerating, I think this is a situation where every day matters, and there should be a very good reason to delay fixing the peg. It\u2019s also important context that any decision now could easily be switched later by governance, meaning that even if the initial implementation is quite simple, it obviously doesn\u2019t mean that Maker is somehow permanently chained to that version. Rather it could simply act as a short term solution that provides some much needed relief to the peg, only to later be replaced by a more sophisticated solution that the community has had plenty of time to discuss and design Edit: Apparently omen.eth does support Dai now, however if you look at the site in practice I think it is clear that USDC is the de facto main currency on the site, and I believe that this has been attributed to the broken peg as, as far as I know, the original plan was that it would be Dai focused, or even Dai exclusive.

                    "content": "The PSM would help against COMP, or any other disruptions to the peg if governance is willing to increase the debt ceilings of stablecoins enough to accomodate it. It means Maker governance will always have a \u201cfix the peg\u201d button available at all times, as an option. It would have a big impact right now, even without further increases to debt ceilings by making sure that the approved 40 million debt ceiling for USDC would actually be used (as right now it is not used, likely due to the strict risk parameters) And even with limited stablecoin debt ceilings, the existence of a large amount of stablecoins available to buy Dai at 1 USD makes the protocol more attractive to vault users, as it provides them guaranteed liquidity for their Dai even when generating large amounts of Dai at once. This dynamic of guaranteed liquidity in fiat backed stablecoins at the peg is also crucial in cutting through the chicken and egg problem that exists with onboarding real world assets as collateral to the system, as real world loan originators need a large amount of liquidity before it becomes worth it to spend the enormous amount of effort that it would require to learn how to engage with the Maker protocol. The PSM helps provide this guaranteed liquidity directly, even if governance is unwilling to increase the stablecoin debt ceilings beyond the current 40 million. So it will in all circumstances be a big step forward towards solving the long term issues with the peg. However, as a separate argument I do believe that it is absolutely the best option for maker governance to begin much larger scale onboarding of stablecoins as collateral (this works even better with the PSM due to the multiplier effects noted above, but even without the PSM it is better than doing nothing). The alternative is to let the peg fail, or work towards implementing negative rates. To continue to let the peg fail is suicidal, as it is eroding the organic growth that the project has built up for years, and this erosion is happening at an accelerating pace as we now approach month 4 of a broken peg. I know the numbers look good right now on daistats, but what we\u2019re seeing is that organic users are being replaced by artificial demand driven by compound. Yet the dogma is that maker governance should just continue to let the peg fail, on the basis of an emotional argument that \u201ccentralized stablecoins are of the devil, and ETH is pure\u201d, and keeping maker \u201cpure\u201d is more important than the delivering on the one promise that Maker governance has made to its userbase, which is to keep Dai stable at 1 USD. The systemic reliance that ETH and BTC has on Tether and Binance is conveniently overlooked every single time someone argues against USDC as collateral, but the fact is that USDC, PAX and other regulated and legit stablecoins actually are among the only options for hedging the indirect exposure that Maker has to Tether and Binance right now. IMO someone who is not willing to take action to fix the peg through higher debt ceilings and different risk parameters, should then argue for implementing negative rates (which I would completely respect, it\u2019s just important to be realistic about how big of a challenge that actually is). Just letting the peg fail is a betrayal of the users of the system, especially when it is being done based on a purist argument that ignores the role of Tether in crypto markets and the indirect exposure Maker has. Edit: something that add that obviously needs to be clearly spelled out, is that of course no one would want to see a large concentration of stablecoins for a long time in the portfolio, just like it wouldn\u2019t be good to have a lot of any other asset. The end goal in all cases is a diversified collateral portfolio. But the whole point is that choosing to fix the peg in the short term through a lot of stablecoins, enables the ecosystem to then move forward to a state where a lot of e.g. real world assets can be onboarded to proper diversify the collateral portfolio. Choosing to keep the peg broken, means choosing to wither and die by alienating all the organic users of the system who aren\u2019t in on the purity-but-lets-ignore-tether religion. ",

However, this feels very rushed and I am concerned about the possibility of overlooking subtle bugs, especially involving multi-contract interactions. This will also increase the complexity of governing the system (particularly PSM-DSR interactions), and it seems prudent to explore those issues as far as possible before taking on-chain action. Thus I am personally in favor of a slower, MIPs-based process, unless a strong argument can be presented that a swift implementation of a PSM is an existential necessity for the Maker protocol. In the meantime, why not consider a significant ETH debt ceiling increase to combat the high peg deviation? Is something going on with COMP farming that makes that a bad idea? ",

A forum poll doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s targeting the right group of decision makers for something this important/significant.   It\u2019s very difficult to make assumptions about what the majority of MKR wants. If we\u2019d gone straight on-chain you could equally well have asked why MKR Holders being forced into immediate action outside of the established governance processes. There needs to be some threshold for considering whether an action can take place as an emergency response. As I stated previously, those thresholds are a majority (or in this case a 2/3rds majority) in favour taking action, or a recommendation from the Risk Team that emergency action is warranted.     Tosh9.0:  is the 2/3rd\u2019s majority (66%) required for passing an \u201cemergency/expedited\u201d response in Forum Signal Requests generally?

                    "content": "Here are what I see to be the main issues with PSM (relative to the status quo) which should be explored in further discussion before it is implemented:   It is not at all clear that deploying a PSM will address the ongoing issue with Compound sucking up DAI due to COMP rewards and idiosyncratically narrow supply-borrow spread. In fact, a likely outcome is that the PSM ceiling is immediately maxed out as farmers swap USDC to DAI to take advantage of the better COMP-adjusted yields on the DAI market, further extending DAI\u2019s lead as a COMP farming Schelling point as its total borrow increases. Unlike current COMP farmers who are borrowing DAI from CDPs, MakerDAO will earn no ongoing yield from those users to compensate for the stablecoin risk that it is taking on. Once we\u2019ve hit the ceiling, we might be back in the situation we started with, except with extra USDC exposure, and more DAI in Compound. Instead of solving the Compound issue, there is a risk that the PSM only deepens DAI\u2019s exposure to both COMP yield and to USDC.   In general, unlike the status quo with stablecoin CDPs, the PSM does not allow the system to earn a risk premium to compensate for the risk that it takes on exposure to collateral. This actually violates one of the core assumptions of MakerDAO, which is that any risk that the system takes should be compensated with a reward, with the reward \u201cfunding\u201d the risk in the long run by creating a surplus buffer and/or supporting the value of MKR in the event that the system needs to be recapitalised. Changing the economics of MakerDAO to make it possible for the majority of the risk taken by the system (in the event that USDC exposure balloons) to be uncompensated by a risk premium is a very significant departure from the current economic model, and IMO requires extensive discussion.   Unlike the status quo with stablecoin CDPs, allowing the system to mint DAI 1:1 against stablecoins creates an immediate mark-to-market accounting deficit, meaning that the PSM\u2019s stablecoin exposure might be very difficult or impossible to unwind (without Emergency Shutdown). In particular, when the PSM mints 100 DAI and puts 100 USDC on the system\u2019s balance sheet, if the market price of DAI at that time is $1.01, the system has asccrued a $1 loss/deficit on a mark-to-market basis. In the event of ES, the system is still solvent because the DAI debt will be marked not to market, but to the target price of $1.00. However, without ES, there is no way for the system to unwind the USDC position without realising a loss. Note that this markedly different from stablecoin CDPs, where the system is not exposed to a loss unless the market price of DAI exceeds the target price by the liquidation ratio, and only the CDP owner\u2019s mark-to-market equity is affected by the market price of DAI.   I think all 3 of these are such serious issues/discussion points that further discussion is required, at the very least, before proceeding with the implementation of the PSM proposal. ",

There are more cases with excess PSM DAI not paying the SF where the surplus could be drained due to DSR fees being greater than SF + PSM (if there is a fee) revenues generated.   PSM only makes sense when DSR is zero. The reason that we might want DSR>0 is if DAI/USD was less than 1. If DAI/USD<1 then it would be profitable to drain the PSM. You buy DAI cheap, sell it to the PSM, and get 1 USDC per 0.99 DAI. The cheaper DAI gets, the more the incentive to drain the PSM. Once the PSM is empty then the DSR can be safely raised. It might make sense to gate the PSM to the DSR==0. That is, add code to ensure that the PSM will not mint DAI unless the DSR is set to zero. ",

If we set a spread on this why not use the same vault mechanics to support it.   Meaning use PSM to open a USDC vault and pay the SF fee with the spread profits until it comes under liquidation or closes naturally.   My bet is that these would liquidate and again a reason to turn liquidations on and use a system based USDC facility as normal to manage the PSM exposure. Then we satisfy your 2 and 3 directly.   The issue will be that the PSM will need a low LR USDC vault since it is giving up liquidity directly almost 1:1 and even at 101LR and with spread fee of 1% would immediately put these kinds of vaults at liquidation risk.  At least if we were to try to apply vault mechanics to this PSM DAI creation.  This idea perhaps illustrates directly the issues with the PSM from a risk, fee management standpoint. ",

That might be true but one still has to clear that trade otherwise if say the spread was 1.01 and .99 we have to see PEG < .99 before the USDC will clear from the PSM and will we still be at a DSR of 0?  We don\u2019t want to manually have to clear these facilities and who is going to sell 1 DAI for .99 USDC to clear it if the price is at .995 or .992? Granted we can just let this sit there and not raise a SF till the PSM USDC clears but do we really want to do that?  It was why I wanted assymetric pricing on the facility so we would quickly mop up the USDC purchased at say 1.01 or 1.02 at say .997 or .998.   But then again perhaps not. I think what people are forgetting in this PSM talk is that our current situation is being driven by comp farming and not any NORMAL market situation.   As @equivrel points out above and I agree with him.  THe PSM will not fix this situation.   Look at what is going on here.  PEG is 1.015+/-.005 and sustained.  USDC rate of 4% looks to be about correct so USDC facility isn\u2019t pegged, and ETH borrow rates are now in the 3% range on compound.   This is sustained demand that we can\u2019t price out with higher SF\u2019s across the spectrum of assets (ETH-A say) without driving the PEG up, and even if we somehow drove rates down wouldn\u2019t the cheap DAI just be soaked up entirely even if we could magically mint another 200-500M DAI to try to saturate the market demand to drive the PEG down. So I think it is important to distinguish what the PSM can and will address how as distinguished from what it probably can\u2019t (i.e. comp farming) clearly. Does anyone have a cogent argument against the idea that the PSM simply is not going to deal with the comp problem as well as the PEG unless we are literally talking about flooding the market with DAI and hope the PEG comes in line and that we somehow saturate comp farmers with so much DAI it becomes less profitable for them to use it?   I honestly am skeptical we could saturate the comp farming demand enough to drive the PEG down with anything short of .25-.5B DAI here and that may not even be enough.  Then we have to somehow magically sop this up without also seeing the PEG drop much below 1 when compound changes things again. One other thing I\u2019d like to see @rune answer is how well the PEG needs to be satisfied to bring market players back.  I do not ever see DAI having a PEG that is as good as a centrally managed one by any definition unless the system itself takes on higher risk by putting the PEG first and risk second in terms of priorities for the system.

If Dai price is between these prices which is the goal pretty much just sit there and do little to nothing.   I don\u2019t think this is clear yet. One of the problems we have is that, aside from the innate incentives in the protocol, there\u2019s not a way to quickly helicopter in new Dai supply to satisfy market demand. This is really only a problem when Dai is above the peg, as we have several ways to sop up Dai supply during periods of less demand (namely, a price below peg which encourages vaultholders to repay, higher stability fees that discourage long-term leveraging, and the Dai Savings Rate which encourages lockup.) Since the only real \u201cproblem\u201d Dai has is that there\u2019s too much demand for the system to scale quickly enough, I\u2019d argue that the low-end of the band should be set directly at the peg, and the upper band, the buy price, should be some amount higher than that, and at a level that does not discourage market making. This would allow the PSM to fill with USDC when it\u2019s needed, but clear out when we\u2019re back at peg, and might even be a valuable metric for considering whether we are \u201cat peg\u201d or not. In this scenario, the PSM is only utilized in times of Dai demand, and the proven facilities of stability fees and the DSR can be reengaged to manage the peg on the other side of $1. ",

Looking long-term, this looks very promising for the implementation of the PSM. That said, in accordance with my statements prior to poll completion, we\u2019ll move forward on this issue in the following way. I think this path is a fair compromise given the circumstances surrounding this issue. Because the expedited / emergency option did not reach 2/3rds consensus, we will not be implementing the PSM in the executive on Friday. Instead, we will follow the next fastest option of implementation in a few weeks. In practice, this means that we will vote on the PSM in the last week of July*, having discussed it during the month. There will be a chance to discuss the PSM in every governance and risk meeting between now and the end of July, starting this Thursday. I kept track of potential sybil accounts voting in this poll. I think it is very unlikely that sybil-like behaviour affected the result, if indeed any was present at all. I don\u2019t think that this remote possibility justifies invalidating the outcome. Thank you all for voting, I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from many of you in the governance and risk meetings over the next few weeks. * It is always possible that a more serious emergency may require implementation before the end of July. That said, the bar for this is going to be quite high given that this has failed to pass as an emergency measure once already. ",

On the PSM & Timeline We are opposed to the implementation of this PSM proposal on both substantive and procedural grounds. We share @equivrel\u2019s concerns that:  it will likely exacerbate the dynamics of COMP-driven exogenous demand for DAI (i.e. will not return it to the peg), it will not provide ratable compensation for those risks, and it could be difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to unwind the facility without causing extreme dislocations in the market for DAI (e.g. an emergency shutdown).  Given those points and the generally polarizing nature of the issue we would oppose an implementation of this PSM proposal. While any path forward is likely to be contentious, it is especially critical that the community feels it has had time to fully consider the menu of options and subject each to a high standard of scrutiny. Of course, governance is inherently messy so we hope to avoid overly prescriptive suggestions. The only procedural point we feel strongly about is that a public MKR Poll is appropriate before any concrete proposal(s) are put to executive vote. On the broader issue of the peg @cyrus, @equivrel, and others suggested that some context on how we think about the broader issue (DAI>$1) may be helpful to understanding our perspective on the PSM. It\u2019s our view that expansion of the acceptable collateral supply in response to excess demand at the zero-rate barrier is, inherently, a decision that MKR holders shoulder the risk rather than passing the cost on to DAI holders. We are not dogmatically opposed to relaxing collateral requirements in order to relieve pressure on the peg; in Maker\u2019s short history it has frequently been the most practical option. But like any tool there are limits to its safe application \u2013 returns on supply expansions diminish quickly if you stop moving out on the risk curve, and Maker can only take on so much before those risks accumulate into a credible threat to the system\u2019s long-term sustainability. The potentially fundamental nature of @equivrel\u2019s concerns may be an indication that we are already up against that barrier and that it is time to more seriously explore alternative mechanisms (e.g. negative real rates) as necessary for steady-state maintenance of the peg.

As far as I can see for the Compound dynamic there are two forces at play:  Increased overall Dai supply which will decrease the APY as a fixed supply of COMP are distributed to a larger collateral pool. Increased relative Dai borrow amount which will increase the portion of the COMP rewards going to the Dai collateral and thus increasing APY.  These forces operate in opposite directions, but the second force falls off more rapidly. To see why this is let\u2019s double the Dai supply in Compound and see how that effects the two forces:  APY will reduce by 50% due to the first force. Twice as many tokens taking the Dai portion of the COMP rewards. Currently Dai is taking ~78% of the 2880 COMP tokens. This will increase to 87% by doubling the Dai supply. An increase in APY of ~12%.  The decrease of 50% will more than counter the increase of 12% which means that increasing the Dai supply to Compound is a good move no matter what the source of that Dai. ",

But, while it makes sense to view negative rates as an alternative to onboarding lots of stablecoins, I think it\u2019s a mistake to see negative rates as an alternative to activating PSMs. The PSM mechanism doesn\u2019t inherently mean onboarding lots of stablecoins, in fact there is synergy between PSMs and negative rates as well: Having negative rates means that PSMs can provide significant liquidity and peg stability, even with low debt ceilings at all rates, positive and negative, similar to how they would function at a positive DSR/Base rate. PSMs also, in all situations, mean that the Maker Protocol can earn income from trading non-Dai stablecoins against each other. That being said I personally think most people that are right now considering negative rates have not yet considered the ecosystem-wide ramifications of implementing them, as the disruption it would cause to every single app that supports Dai would be immense. However it\u2019s important that the community begins serious discussion about negative rates sooner rather than later, as it will help move past the current situation where governance appears content with maintaining the status quo of the system just languishing with a broken peg for months. We may very soon see a showdown of the only two realistic options available to the community: Onboarding large amounts of stablecoins, or implementing negative rates. If forced to choose, which one will the community pick? However, this question actually doesn\u2019t have anything to do with whether or not PSMs should be implemented - they are an equally useful mechanism for creating a more stable and liquid peg in both scenarios.

However, we are still digesting the information on this proposal and the comments and we are feeling rushed to formulate a reasonable response under this time frame. I\u2019d like to request that we extend the time frame on this signal request to give people enough time to adequately respond.   @brianmcmichael and @cmooney very much would like to see this response.     g_dip:  I agree with this sentiment. I don\u2019t understand why the MKR holders are being deprived of immediate action if that\u2019s (potentially) what the majority of MKR wants? A forum poll doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s targeting the right group of decision makers for something this important/significant.   I don\u2019t think MKR holders are being denied anything since anyone can put up an on-chain poll as well as post a new executive.     LongForWisdom:  Due to the nature of this change (very different to what we\u2019ve done in the past) and the timeline and recent holidays we will require a 66% majority on the \u2018expedited\u2019 (read emergency) measure option in order to pursue that route .   I am really mixed on this.   I don\u2019t think the world runs around US holidays.    Perhaps a general change regarding what is needed poll wise to proceed on an \u2018emergency\u2019 measure is what is required.   While I don\u2019t know how to do this my understanding is that anyone can put up an on-chain poll so if even one MKR holder with ability to do this could put up such a poll is there anything stopping them?   Or is this kind of a technical issue in that other things need to change in the governance portal as well when putting up an on-chain poll.?   Really these last questions are more of a governance curiosity than anything else. As far as I can tell we have not even polled on whether the PEG is an emergency or not so I am uncertain regarding status on the 66% needed to treat this as an emergency action.   I think most are concerned about the PEG but if we are going to classify this as an emergency then once that is determined lets line up our tools to manage this.    But be prepared in the sense that if the PEG is out of whack because of COMP - I am completely with @equivrel that unless we are prepared to flood the market with perhaps 200-500M DAI  and subsequently soak it up when compound changes - yet again - yanking the markets change a piddly 20-40M probably won\u2019t do enough.     rune:  It would have a big impact right now, even without further increases to debt ceilings by making sure that the approved 40 million debt ceiling for USDC would actually be used (as right now it is not used, likely due to the strict risk parameters) And even with limited stablecoin debt ceilings, the existence of a large amount of stablecoins available to buy Dai at 1 USD makes the protocol more attractive to vault users, as it provides them guaranteed liquidity for their Dai even when generating large amounts of Dai at once.   I think this is telling us 4% is too high of a rate.  I saw ETH facility going up on compound and wondered if people were just borrowing ETH to cycle into Maker at the 0%SF. I literally don\u2019t think anyone knows how much DAI would be required to bring the PEG back into line here nor what price in USDC to sell it at.   My rough guess is that somewhere between 100-200M priced in the 1.005 to 1.01 range would be enough to pull the PEG down under 1.001.   I have no clue what it would take to bring it to 1 at this point.   Which is why I have been advocating different PSM facilities with different fee/pricing spreads and different DC\u2019s - we need to gauge what the markets are trying to tell us on this vs. trying to dictate to markets what we want them to do with a flood of abnormally cheap liquidity that will only be paying whatever onetime facility fee to access.   We literally could end up with no-one using the vaults for DAI and only generating fees from one-time swaps on the DAI-stablecoin swap facility. ",

                    "content": "    rune:  But, while it makes sense to view negative rates as an alternative to onboarding lots of stablecoins, I think it\u2019s a mistake to see negative rates as an alternative to activating PSMs.   More tools for monetary policy are good.   I think we should have a negative interest rate discussion. I know i posted somewhere on the idea of paying vault holders to open vaults since this would encourage taking on debt and in effect the DAI payout to vaults basically could run against future accrued interest (it doesn\u2019t have to be paid just pledged against future interest as a kind of DAI interest redemption token given to vault holders and hence traded as a interest reducer).   Now if holding some of these caused the furture SF to come down for a vault as well - that would be very interesting. I really would like to see some proposal regarding a implementation of negative rates though as the above was the only thing I could come up with regarding negative rates that did not drain the surplus and was accounted for with a token in the vault but all of this necessitates contract changes. If we talk about negative rates I think we need to pay attention to whether an idea requires significant contract changes, secondary wallet changes, or ? Don\u2019t get me wrong - I want to have this discussion I have a feeling here implementing an effective negative rate strategy is probably going to be difficult but I know there are a lot of clever people around here so perhaps someone will have a good idea that is easily implemented.

I talked about this a while back but personally i think you might be able to artificially create negative rates by offering a vaults for DAI liquidity pools uniswap.    [UNI-V1] Uniswap Liquidity Tokens as Collateral   What i am trying to get at on the monetary policy front is that this would actually give you a way to inflate the DAI supply by listing on uniswap. Users would be able to take DAI they had to mint a uniswap token then can turn around and take that uniswap token to mint more DAI. If the SF for the uniswap token was sufficiently low i imagine you could use this mechanism create some downward pressure on the dai price.   Granted that idea kinda was squashed by the oracle team but it still seems like a much lower effort approach compared to rewriting / auditing / deploying / and migrating new vault contracts to include actual negative stability fees. Could post a bit of napkin math I did a while back if people are interested. ",
