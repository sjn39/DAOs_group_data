Please take a couple minutes to fill out this survey, to help us improve the Gitcoin Digest. P.S. No airdrops will be given for completing this survey   1016\u00d7926 57.4 KB   How Do We Create Sustainable Revenue Streams to Fund the DAO? This week, we explored the question \u201cHow does a DAO become sustainable?\u201d in our Gitcoin Community Call on Wednesday. More specifically, we asked, \u201cHow does Gitcoin become sustainable?\u201d. One of the main questions during the call was, \u2018should we design grants protocols to take a small fee on every grants donation?\u2019 One community member noted that \u201cGofundme charges 2.9% +$0.30 on every donation\u201d. Others on the call raised concerns that the grants protocol was more likely to be forked if we charged a transaction fee. Ben West offered his perspective that, \u201cI think the forking risk is lower than we might think. Most of our partners don\u2019t have the staff time and expertise to run their own rounds and will want/need our support\u201d. During the call, we jammed in a Miro board to crowdsource potential answers to these questions here. This is a topic that we will continue to discuss in the coming year! Check the #dao-citizens channel for the recording of the call.   In This Issue of the Digest  DAO News   Content Roundup   Top Posts from the Gov.

A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023, by a33titude  Gitcoin community member, a33titude, provides an analysis for both bearish and bullish scenarios for Gitcoin and the GTC token in 2023. They also recently posted \u201cWeb3 Crowdfunding Tool Competitive Landscape\u201d on the forum. Bearish scenarios include: the bear market drags on and GTC continues to lose value; grants protocols struggle to find product-market fit; and/or Gitcoin runs out of runway before finding sustainable sources of funding. Bullish scenarios include: grants protocols finds product-market fit and has billions of $ going passing through; Passport becomes \u201cthe foundation of a new sybil resistant economy in web3\u201d; and/or GTC finds true utility as a governance token in the DAO.
