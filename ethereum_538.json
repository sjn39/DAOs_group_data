Putting oldest posts first does not feel very effective, and on top of that I have to scroll a lot (with stops for lazy-loading) just to get to the bottom. Other than that the site is very nice. What I particularly don\u2019t like is that ethereum-magicians is a new site that developers have to sign up for, making it a few extra steps of difficulty for people to have this discussion. It seems like a conversation that was well in the public eye (Github) has been moved to this other site that essentially does the same thing but is less accessible to the general public (of developers). Lets keep conversations out in the open.   ",

How exactly individual decisions are reached is to be determined, but it will likely follow our proposed principle of rough consensus. We are planning on having our next in-person Council and around early July in Berlin. ",

                    "content": "I think the comment thread format of Reddit makes it easier to follow specific trails of inquiry and discussion. This is important when the level of participation is high, as it may be when contentious issues are discussed. Consider someone new coming to the EIP-999 thread. Are they expected to read through each comment? There is no ranking. Everyone wants to have their say and make their own points. In fact it\u2019s like this even in the short thread I started myself. The ranking by vote that Reddit offers also helps to bring the better arguments to the top. Maybe it\u2019s personal preference, or maybe if others appreciate it too, it\u2019s something that plugins can be used to offer here. Another reason, though, is that Reddit is where many people already are. Why fight against that (with a new location) when participation should be valued? We can also layer Ethereum functionality within the Reddit interface. I\u2019m doing this, now, with a browser plugin. Currently it\u2019s just rinkeby deployed but for many purposes actually that doesn\u2019t matter. It identifies other users who have registered an Ethereum address with their Reddit username, allows direct tipping to them, up/down voting specific posts and comments (mirroring the reddit functionality), and staking in support or rejection of posts (posts are removed if the market is in rejection after 1 hour). These are just experiments. What I\u2019d like to demonstrate is that we can Ethereum-ise the Reddit community. Maybe karma from Ethereum related subs can be used in some way, or the date of their first post in an Ethereum sub (these are record on-chain when they register). Thanks you for the information regarding Councils. I hope this is a fruitful endeavour as I believe it\u2019s crucially needed. Edit. grammatical errors ",
