                    "content": "With the impending close of MakerDAO\u2019s beloved Rocket.chat, we\u2019re excited to announce the launch of the MakerDAO Official Discord Server! Please join using this link: MakerDAO Official Discord Starting October 31, 2021, Rocket.chat will be shut down and Discord will take over as the community\u2019s main platform for chat. New channels include public and private channels for Core Units, a channel for our Spanish-speaking community members, and three rooms for voice chat. The voice chat channels are available for anyone to use on a first-come, first-served basis.  Using the Server Due to the way Discord handles roles and permissioning, all users must be assigned roles in order to make different channels available to different users. Upon joining the Discord server, you\u2019ll only be able to see a few channels. For access to all of the basic channels, read the #rules and click the blue heart emoji  to automatically be assigned to the \u201cCommunity\u201d role. We\u2019ll be manually giving Core Unit Facilitators, Contributors, Delegates, and other stakeholders roles to provide access to various private channels over the next few days so thanks for your patience while we get that sorted out.  Commemorative NFTs  To celebrate this transition, we\u2019ve created a MakerDAO Rocket.chat NFT! Anyone who\u2019s been part of the community on Rocket.chat is welcome to claim an NFT. If the NFT in the picture above looks a bit blurry, that\u2019s because the original version is animated! Check out the animated version on POAP\u2019s event page. Thanks to Proof-of-Attendance-Protocol (POAP), NFTs may be claimed for free on the xDai network. POAP will also allow you to claim your NFT on mainnet if you don\u2019t mind paying the transaction fee. If you already provided an ETH address along with your Discord handle, please reach out so we can get your NFT to you! We didn\u2019t realize POAP would provide codes to claim the NFTs rather than giving us the ability to airdrop them to specific addresses. To claim the MakerDAO Rocket.chat NFT, please reach out and let me know your Rocket.chat handle via Rocket.chat (@seth.goldfarb), Discord (GoldenChaos#4493), or DM here in the Forum.  Credit Where It\u2019s Due This has been a collaborative effort between @GovAlpha-Core-Unit, Tech-Ops, @gov-comms-core-unit, and @content-production so big thanks to everyone involved in putting this together!
