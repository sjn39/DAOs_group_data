                    "content": " MIP39c2-SP26: Adding Pairwyse Fixed-Rate Core Unit - PAIR-001  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 26 Author(s): Akiva Dubrofsky, Avtar Singh Sehra, Ashwin Tumne Contributors: Pairwyse Foundation Tags: core-unit, cu-pair-001, mandate Status: RFC Date Applied: 2021-10-22 Date Ratified: Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp26-adding-pairwyse-fixed-rate-core-unit/11150   Sentence Summary The Pairwyse Foundation has implemented an out-of-box solution and deployed a product for the provision of fixed-rate DAI loans of arbitrary term-length via the Pairwyse protocol built atop Maker\u2019s credit and deposit facilities.  Paragraph Summary The Pairwyse Foundation has deployed smart contracts and off-chain technology services to enable a DAI financing and investment marketplace that will provision Fixed-Rates on MakerDAO vaults. The Pairwyse Foundation will continue to drive technical development and operational support for the Pairwyse protocol at no cost to MKR holders. The Foundation has secured commitments from a network of independent investors to seed this marketplace and build an open ecosystem and decentralized governance which simply grows by participation. MKR holders are the primary beneficiaries of protocol-generated interest income.  883\u00d7551 80.7 KB   Specification / Proposal Details  Motivation  Pairwyse: Problem and Solution The Pairwyse protocol specifically solves the impossible trinity for MakerDAO by creating a fixed-rate marketplace for borrowers and lenders without restricting Maker\u2019s ability to use floating rates and market-driven capital flows to maintain the DAI peg and grow its supply.   How Pairwyse Solves This Pairwyse smart contracts directly address the asset-liability mismatch problem using a Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) that creates a matched book between lender investment and borrower financing. By wrapping Maker\u2019s credit and deposit instruments, the FRA smart contract mediates a continuous interest rate swap between borrower and lender escrows resulting in a net fixed-rate for both parties.   Benefits for MKR Holders By funnelling existing DAI investors back into a Maker-centric lending marketplace, Pairwyse can provide Maker:  a fixed-rate facility to scale RWA and institutional vaults rapidly and sustainably freedom to apply as-dynamic-as-possible governance over DAI peg and supply a means to scale transaction volume and revenue in a DAI neutral manner a channel to funnel DAI holders back into Maker and away from competitors a stronger user network and loyalty through scalable peer-to-peer transactions   For more info on Pairwyse, please explore the following links.  Links  Maker Forum Post Pairwyse AMA (video) Whitepaper Github Pairwyse.io   Core Unit ID PAIR-001  Core Unit Name Pairwyse Fixed-Rate Core Unit  Core Unit Mandate   The Pairwyse Foundation will provide all Pairwyse technologies and operations at no cost to MKR holders. The Pairwyse protocol will only add a nominal admin fee of 30bps per transaction (APY) which can be charged to the borrower\u2019s account or, optionally, to investment banks placing deals on Pairwyse. This fee can be adjusted lower with higher monetary volumes. Maker will realize immediate benefits from increased revenue, TVL, transaction volumes, market share, and P2P networks.   Pairwyse is VC-backed and its network will create new liquidity and origination sources for Maker, helping establish a bridge between legacy capital and DAI. This will include creation of new DAI investment and liquidity pools to fund offerings and place them in primary markets.   The Pairwyse network will lead an effort to help Maker build a secondary DAI marketplace of investors and borrowers, built over Maker credit and deposit facilities as the settlement layer for all transactions. The Pairwyse Foundation will utilize the transparency of ethereum to the fullest extent possible to build strong pillars for such a marketplace.   We will establish a network of investment banks to grow MakerDAO specifically in the fixed rates market segment. Pairwyse has partnered with Nivaura who works closely with UK Regulators and has: i. Digitized a 7 Billion Dollar debt issuance for the London Stock Exchange. ii. Completed various private placements on their platform with DBS Bank iii. Digitized a bond transaction with Santander   Pairwyse will be adding 1 more regulated mid-market investment bank to the network shortly. We plan to expand this network going forward.   Pairwyse requires no direct effort from Maker for technical development & integration. As such, Pairwyse requires no changes to the Maker protocol to operate.   In addition to smart contracts, we will cover the cost of all required oracles, monitoring systems, audits and off-chain services for effective operationalization of Pairwyse. Pairwyse smart contracts have been validated, with another audit pending completion in November by Peckshield.   To help with business development, we will white label Pairwyse solutions, allowing MKR holders and enterprising broker-dealers to grow user networks over Maker and DAI. This will enable development of network-driven branding, marketing and distribution assets as necessary to capture market demand and deal-flow for Maker.   The Pairwyse Foundation is eager to work with potential collaborators and entrepreneurs interested in developing unique offerings over Maker and DAI. We invite and welcome feedback and collaboration from the Maker community. We will continue to work closely with Maker Open Market, RWA, Growth and Risk CUs, helping them build opportunities and scale.    telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-6024084352020887737-y1280\u00d7636 102 KB  ",

                    "content": "Post To Maker Community: This is a post to bring the community up to date on recent developments. As the community considers multiple proposals for fixed rate solutions such as Deco Fixed Rate CU, Term Lending Module, Institutional & Long-term Vaults and Pairwyse, we wish to disclose some important information regarding the approach that the Akiva team has taken. The Maker community members that were mentioned in the Deco Fixed Rate proposal have received private communications from @Akiva who has made proprietary claims based upon a Patent Application he has filed. @Akiva has stated:  As you know, MIP39c2-SP23 proposes to adopt the Deco protocol to facilitate Fixed Rate Vaults and was recently submitted for a vote. Akiva Capital is a strong believer in the concept of providing fixed rate vaults for the Maker community.  We believe that we were the first to develop our technology to do so and, as pioneers, we believe strongly in the importance of protecting our intellectual property.  Accordingly, we have sought and have already obtained some patent protection for our invention. We were granted a Japanese patent earlier this year.  We also have related patent applications pending in other countries, including the U.S.A. and Singapore. Copies of the Japanese patent and our international patent application are attached for your information. For a better understanding of these materials and our patent rights, we strongly suggest that you review them promptly with your patent lawyers. I welcome the opportunity to speak further with you at your convenience, should you have any questions. Yours sincerely, Akiva Link1 Link2  The US Patent Application is simply a request and not the grant of any Patent rights whatsoever. It will be some time before the Patent Examiner renders a judgment and only upon considering all of the circumstances and competing claims. We reviewed the legal claim presented in the Application and wish to transparently disclose the results of our review. We are familiar with this type of tactic, and our team is fully prepared to respond in an assertive manner. The claim in the Patent Application is without merit. First, I wish to make it clear that I am solely responsible for the architecture and technical design, as well as the integration and operational strategy. None of the individuals who have received vale threats of legal action are responsible for the product. In some instances, e.g., @wouter, @juan, @NikKunkel, have provided feedback regarding navigating the governance process where we lacked experience with the details and requirements and yet they were subjected to ill treatment even though they have nothing to do with the Deco protocol. Deco for Maker, DecoM, as a legal entity will be responsible for the integration and operation of the system and will defend the protocol against all claims, as well as defend and indemnify any individual in the Maker ecosystem who may be included in litigation initiated by @Akiva or others. @Akiva\u2019s claim to be \u201cthe first to develop\u201d the technology regarding \u201cfixed rate vaults\u201d is without substance and his Patent Application is not supported by the facts. Our legal analysis of the documentation provided demonstrates that his claim is without merit and will not withstand regulatory and/or judicial scrutiny for several reasons, including:  We invented the initial iteration of the concept and placed it in the public domain before any Provisional Applications were filed by @akiva. Akiva has simply trolled our progress as we have discussed it openly with members of the community. Deco is distinctly different and superior to the claims of @akiva in its Patent Application. One can see from the list of claims made regarding deals with borrowers, permission from CDPs, liquidity suppliers, difference calculations to settle, no tokenization et cetera, that it is very different from Deco. Deco for Maker which is being proposed and voted on here is distinctly different and superior to the claims of @akiva in its Patent Application. These are just the broad elements and there is much more to be said but must be reserved for legal.  Please do not hesitate to ask any question you may have. ",

I have admired and casually used Maker for a while, and felt this is probably one of the most underrated projects in all of crypto, as it has the potential to change the fabric of financial services and how we consider the concept of money. For this reason, adding fixed rate services to this ecosystem in a stable and sustainable manner is key and an inevitable requirement. However, this goes beyond a simple technical concept, but has some deeply intricate economic complexities and associated risks. I believe that when you are building such complex systems, you need multiple redundancies and very loose coupling between components. As such, solving the impossible trinity effectively requires multiple competing fixed rate marketplace services that work independently, and interact with Maker protocol to provision the key fixed rate services. Coupling in this context is not just about technical integration, but also about monetary and or endorsement associations.

I am looking forward to working closely with all the community and other fixed rate service providers   Can you explain how you think this is compatible with the attempted use of software patents? Patents and open-source software development are usually seen as antithetical. There is a long history of OSS foundations fighting off patent claims. Many open-source projects have been harmed by this practice, setting back the state of, for example, compiler technology and audio/video compression. Since DAOs can only compete with centralized organizations through openness, low barriers to entry, and free competition, it\u2019s hard to see how this would be helpful. Your tactics seem to actively try and prevent this and instead cement a monopoly position for yourself, reducing the protocol\u2019s innovative potential. And be paid for it too! It\u2019s clearly understood in the community that any work done that is in any way funded by the Maker Protocol has to be open-source and public domain so that it can maximally benefit the further development of the open ecosystem. Does this exclude your proposal? Will you be bringing legal action against DAO members if MKR voters decide on a different solution than your own? ",

Isn\u2019t the whole idea that it\u2019s a separate marketplace \u2014 like Centrifuge runs \u2014 and the question would be whether Maker wishes to participate in that marketplace as a customer? I haven\u2019t had my coffee yet, so perhaps there\u2019s some change I missed or I didn\u2019t understand Pairwyse properly to begin with.   Let me be clear: Field Technologies will not be supporting anything that looks like an interest-bearing instrument issued by Maker that is not unequivocally covered by an exemption from SEC regulation, nor will it be supporting putting the Maker brand on anything resembling swaps or swaps exchanges.   Our first and most important mission is to protect DAI and the growing financial ecosystem that relies upon it. If that means forgoing some marginal profit \u2014 even if it happens to be large \u2014 to protect the financial stability of the DeFi ecosystem, then so be it. Have some new thing that looks like it could cause Maker problems in the OECD jurisdictions? Tell us the legal and economic risk is low. And then show your work. I am frankly amazed at how willing the DAO has been to not even attempt to locate and consult \u2014 even unofficially\u2014 securities specialists about any of this. Did we learn nothing from our experience with Centrifuge? Do the boring work first. Often times these things can be fixed. But do it first. If the product is good, a delay won\u2019t ruin it. This is not a game, and there will be real consequences if we mess up. In particular, those most opposed to Maker falling under regulation should be the loudest voices for caution. Maker is a complex, largely permissionless financial system. It\u2019s easy to break, and there will not be another one if we do. So let\u2019s all just take a step back for a moment. ",

                    "content": "This is a very good point, and it\u2019s exactly the angle that should be driven by Maker. Simply put, any form of instrument that transform floating to fixed and enables some form of transferability of the asset has a risk of being classified as a security. As such Maker should not be directly supporting any specific service of this nature, either through capital, technical input and or endorsement. However, due to being an open ecosystem, such innovations will take place, and should continue to be developed and tested openly i.e. to my point, innovation on the edges should go forward and evolve in a sensible manner. But just to note, while Pairwyse is building a mechanism for transforming floating to fixed rates, and enabling various credit risk management aspects to pass through from the underlying protocol, it is not creating a separate standalone or  transferable asset, which takes the form of a bond or a derivative i.e. this simply provides a pass through decentralised service for managing cashflows based on agreed terms, and risk can not be transferred from one party to another by selling/transferring an asset; and there is no other counterparty beyond those transacting on the underlying Maker protocol. However, just as Maker is an open and independent protocol, so is the vision of Pairwyse to become such a (\u201c2nd layer\u201d) protocol. Therefore, in the future other (e.g. regulated firms) could utilise the core Pairwyse protocol to build securities types of structures. Which would be one possible usecase that we will look at with some regulated partners. This would be an overall benefit for the Maker ecosystem, and help bridge the gap between crypto and real world financial systems. I would appreciate discussing this with the community, as our goal is to explore and refine our concept at no expense or endorsement of Maker. I personally have operated in the regulated space, and have held controlled positions; as such I will always attempt to operate on the right side of the rules; and work with the community to build a resilient and sustainable ecosystem.

                    "content": "First and foremost we wanted to be very clear that the Pairwyse network and the wider community and partners we are bringing together on this project are fully supportive of the nature of open source software development. However, as we have seen across many industries over the years - and we are now seeing this in crypto - many banking and technology firms in the CeFi world are filing for patents in relation to crypto, DeFi and blockchain related activities. Unfortunately, neither GPL, OSS nor decentralization will fully protect protocols like Maker from the expected onslaught by large players, especially if the goal of DeFi is to provide an alternative to centralized finance. This activity will become an increasing threat to startups working on innovations in the DeFi space. This threat is exacerbated due to the level of financial and legal sophistication large financial services firms have over startups building atop open public infrastructure and projects. We originally sought patents as a defensive measure against regulated international firms who are in a position to crush emerging fintechs on whatever whim of infringement they perceive. Our team has had direct experience of such issues with major firms operating in the crypto space in relation to tokenization and stablecoins. And to be clear, these works involve more than just software - the primary focus are assets and their novel non-trivial treatments. So while the incumbent institutional firms may not be able to execute as efficiently and or as effectively as a small decentralised fintech team, there are no restrictions preventing these institutions from claiming patents on fintech innovations, and then waiting for protocols to succeed before coming after the protocol token holders i.e. the protocol beneficiaries. As such, patent protection can become an asset to a DAO especially as it attempts to bridge DeFi with regulated users. Given the clear precedents in other industries (fintech, lawtech, ecommerce, biotech), we can expect this to become a realistic scenario in DeFi as it continues to demonstrate success. As such, we foresee legal actions becoming a common tactic employed by CeFi players seeking to stifle their DeFi competitors, especially as DeFi becomes increasingly interoperable with centralised financial services. As a community we need to preempt this external threat and not take a naive view of the implications that such patent attempts by large institutions could have for the Maker community and startups innovating in this space. As such, Pairwyse team thought it prudent long ago to protect our work as a defensive position to ensure the network backing the project can take the lead in opening the protocol for fair use and collaborative development under the stewardship of a Foundation. For further emphasis, the Pairwyse team\u2019s position has always been in defense of open competition, and our objectives around patent management help make that possible, not just for us, but all innovators in our space (including peer competitors). Based on our interpretation of events, what we didn\u2019t expect was the potential anti-competitive tactics that have appeared to take hold within our community. We would be keen to discuss why this may or may not be the case, as was our aim in the letter referred to in the comments that was one of several correspondences attempting to open this dialogue.  While we are keen to discuss these issues in an open and collaborative manner, we also need to review and manage the risks posed to our work and to the principles of open innovation by the potential \u201cmonopoly-by-code\u201d situation that may be taking place.  This would be a bad precedent for Maker as it would put the community in the same bucket as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and others who have employed this tactic against innovators in their respective marketplaces. We all agree that coupling such complexity, as proposed by DECO and Pairwyse, with the core protocols like Maker will pose technical, regulatory, legal and financial risks in general. We fully agree with the consensus that the community should be taking a risk averse approach to ensure we collectively build a strong, stable and sustainable infrastructure for DAI users (lenders, borrowers) and the markets in general. However, enabling a privileged team to take anti-competitive actions to build a monopolistic position would effectively kill open entrepreneurship on Maker, not to mention destroy the need for an arms-length separation between MKR holders and regulatory & legal liabilities inherent in fixed-rate provisioning protocols. Such actions will only draw more scrutiny on the DeFi space, not mitigate them, and as such will destroy trust in DAI. So we wanted to make it clear that we fully support innovation, where all innovators compete on their merits, so that innovations can be prudently tested on open markets and may the best product-market fit win for the benefit of all MKR holders. What we do not support are individuals and special interest teams who take predatory actions, and are driven largely by a profit motive and lack foresight in how such actions could negatively impact their benefactors and drive instability in the ecosystem they are taking advantage of. If innovators can\u2019t compete fairly within Maker\u2019s ecosystem, then how can innovators help Maker compete with their external competition? This is the real question we should collectively answer, as it goes beyond Pairwyse and the proposal we have made. ",

The only anti-competitive and opaque tactics that have been used in \u201cour community\u201d are by @Akiva and members of the Pairwyse Team in failing to disclose the IP claim, a very material issue, to the broader community early in the discourse on Pairwyse and Deco. Furtively undermining an ongoing vote, is the kind of gamesmanship reserved to those who seek an unfair advantage and place their self-interest above that of the community. As @wouter noted, it is important that the community hear from the person who sent the \u201cpoorly veiled threats to community member\u201d with an explanation of the rationale behind the threat. @Akiva? The use of Deco and other protocols is not anticompetitive; in fact, it is explicitly the opposite because the best performing protocol will be the most competitive in the marketplace and the greatest contributor to the continued success of Maker. It should be clear from our posts that we support the use of other protocols when they are properly designed, have appropriate safeguards to ameliorate risk, and expand the funnel of Maker users and the reach of Dai. Deco is a superior technical solution, bespoke to Maker, and competitive in the financial marketplace. We encourage comparison to all competing protocols\u2026 ",
