I think part of the reason that EthMagicians started was precisely because of the desire to discuss non-research topics, often more closely related to implementation and \u201cproduction\u201d code. As well, this past year has seen a growth into broader non technical topics, from education to event planning. So, I\u2019m not personally in favour of EthResearch merging into EthMagicians \u2014 but happy to consider it if others are interested! ",

My post stemmed from some confusion among friends around where a particular thread (in relation to staking economics) should be posted to get more attention. Friend was concerned that Magicians forum was taking brains and eyeballs away from ethresear.ch. Totally understand the need for unique forums that deal with other topics but important discussion items that overlap can lead to some brain drain/dilution. Not sure what the solution is! Double post with one post linking to the other? ",

And having group participants choose the main channel. So, something like an \u201cannounce\u201d post \u2014 \u201chey we plan on discussing staking economics, please use tag YYY on group XXX if you want to get involved\u201d. Feel free to ask for a #working-groups to be created if that\u2019s useful. So if you want to have the discussion live on EthResearch but think there are useful stakeholders here \u2014 announcing it here seems like a good solution. Probably would be good as well to explain notifications for categories and tags, too. Not too hard to follow many Discourse based forums if you choose to just watch / get notifications for some tags.
