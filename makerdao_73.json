The process for offboarding assets has been further discussed in a recent forum thread. This post presents a full plan for offboarding USDT vault types (USDT-A, UNI-V2-ETHUSDT-A, and UNI-V2-DAIUSDT-A), and seeks confirmation from the community to move forward with the proposed next steps.  Background Both the Uniswap v2 vault types including USDT (ETHUSDT and DAIUSDT) have zero outstanding debt and debt ceilings set to 0, so no additional action is needed before these vault types can be deprecated. There are 6 remaining Maker vaults using the USDT-A vault type, with the following collateralization and debt levels.  871\u00d7249 32.8 KB  The USDT price feed is not used by any third parties, so once these vaults are closed Maker will be able to remove support for the USDT price feed and reduce operating costs.  Proposed Offboarding Process Set the USDT-A liquidation penalty to 0% Removing the liquidation penalty ensures that we don\u2019t penalize users for deprecation of the USDT-A vault type. Increase USDT-A liquidation ratio to 300% Increasing USDT-A liquidation ratio to 300% is high enough to trigger liquidation of all remaining vaults. After all remaining USDT-A vaults are closed, Maker can remove the USDT price feed and related vault types (USDT-A, UNI-V2-ETHUSDT-A, and UNI-V2-DAIUSDT-A).  Signal Request Poll Do you support the parameter changes outlined above to offboard USDT and related vault types?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This signal request poll will run for the next 2 weeks, until Tuesday September 21. If a majority of forum voters (excluding abstain votes) are in favor, the proposed changes will be submitted for an on-chain governance poll the following week. ",

But it could be a PR issue if we let vault owners lose their collateral. An option to avoid this might include Maker Governance using a flash loan to cover the liquidations. This would also be a nice demonstration of the flash mint module at work. Theoretically, if successful we could use the same tactic to tackle the much larger USDC A and PAX vaults. ",

Look I am one of the first to suggest with others that USDT probably isn\u2019t the cleanest shirt stablecoin, and maybe we don\u2019t even want it in the protoco,l but there are two different questions to ask.  Does governance simply want to exclude USDT?   If so - then this poll is just the final nail in the coffin which was laid long ago. Did governance give USDT a fair chance?    If it didn\u2019t - then is there some inclination to even try to develop this market, or is governance dead set against?  I always felt that USDT with what 36B, against USDC 26B now, was another potential market but my general impression here was that risk and attitude by governance towards USDT was such that this market would never develop.   I just think we never gave this market a fair chance with competitive rates, ever I want to be clear here.   Is governance just dead set about never having USDT in the protocol, or was this a failure to compete? I am a no on this poll to remove until I have some clear guidance from rest of CUs, growth, risk, anyone whether we are just dead set against USDT, or whether we want to develop this market by even attempting to lower rates and using DC to manage protocol risk to give this market a fair chance to develop.  If it doesn\u2019t, or if everyone feels we did ok fine.   Looks like everyone lining up to axe this, so I guess shortly all this will be a moot point. I am all for getting rid of cruft costing us money.   But lets just be clear about >20B markets we want to exclude from this protocol and why they aren\u2019t working. ",
