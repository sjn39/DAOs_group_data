Here is another Because this is naturally a contentious issue (look at how discussions around burning have gone on for months), it seems like a really strong consensus should be requires before proceeding with something so important. Especially since there is already a proposal to give this power to a small group under the task force framework. Some unknowns that I\u2019ve seen mentioned are around the financial usefulness of this endeavor, the relatively opaque process being championed, and probably also some legal implications. Requiring a higher bar for approval should encourage those promoting a money raise to address issues raised by critics since it\u2019s harder to just force something through on a low turnout vote. This signal asks:  That any vote authorizing sale of MKR require 2/3 majority to pass That any vote authorizing sale of debt, debt-like tokens, or any form of \u201cgiving yield\u201d require 2/3 majority to pass MKR vesting, flap auctions, DSR, Deco CU, and any other programs already authorized today are excluded from this requirement If passed, this signal\u2019s effect expires after 6 months  Pros:  Ensures money is only raised if the community is solidly willing to commit to and accept the costs, which also lowers the chances of reneging on obligations Still allows for raising money if needed  Cons:  Makes it harder to raise money in the next 6 months     Should a money raise require 2/3 majority for approval for the next 6 months?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Poll closes in 2 weeks. This is my first attempt at this so if the format is wrong please correct me in the comments ",

And i these types of protection (2/3 votes needed for some specific categories of decisions) should be parte of that. Let me also mention that MakerDao (in theory) should not be a \u201cdictatorship of the 51% majority\u201d because a minority can trigger an Emergency Shutdown (ES). But is this objectively true? (skeptical) For most scenario except the most catastrophic ones? Triggering ES would almost definitely kill MakerDAO or, at least, act as an atomic bomb on the whole DeFi\u2026 So it\u2019s not something we can expect to be used on controversial, but not totally extreme, scenarios.

Those decisions, however, are not alone. Significant debt ceilings, constitutions, transformational actions, might all require non-simple majority. I believe all those should be part of a holistic conversation. I would also truly appreciate the community to stop assuming that different point of views have nefarious or misguided intentions. We are all joining the protocol with different background, experience, and expertise. Accepting other opinions and engaging in constructive conversations is the secret of good development. I have been personally advocating for extreme prudence in some initiatives like large RWAs, as an example, and notwithstanding a large portion of the community was vocally criticising those views, they ultimately proved to be right and backed by the now common desire for conservatism and simplicity. Treasuring the power of insight, we should engage in conversation assuming others might still be in good faith while having a different view. ",

If the argument for why we should do this for a potential raise is that the raise is contentious, well, lots of decisions and proposals in Maker are contentious! It seems dangerous to set a precedent where contentious proposals or decisions must have a 2/3 majority in order to pass. That would be a real paradigm shift and it\u2019s easy to imagine how that could leave Maker locked in stasis. We are already considered a conservative, slow-moving project and this proposal could make it even harder for governance to function. ",

Note also that there is MKR in the Maker treasury and your SR could be clearer about whether using that MKR also needs this 2/3 approval. For example, MKR vesting for a new CU would come from there.

It\u2019s never a good look to see powerful people trying to say a vote by a little guy doesn\u2019t count. ",

It is too risky to try to change actual quorum rules of the protocol and there\u2019s no way to apply a quorum rule to \u201conly fundraise\u201d or similar at the protocol level. At the formal governance level it\u2019s pointless to try to make this protection. A proposal that has an actual majority can just employ the tactic of first removing this requirement, then approving fundraising. But in all cases it is dangerous to get into a spiral of trying to gerrymander governance to the advantage of a particular position. Just increases the likelihood that an MKR majority would choose to declare the entire MIP framework invalid and pass whatever proposal they want anyway, which an MKR majority can do at any time because of the quorum rules at the protocol level. It\u2019s a good test of the limits of governance though. I will definitely remember that we need to update the MIPs to unambiguously eliminate the possibility that any governance gerrymandering can be done through signal requests because that is so obviously against the intention of what signal requests should be used for ",

                    "content": "Hi @AliceinMKRland, thank you for taking the time to post this Signal Request. From GovAlpha\u2019s perspective, we recommend that a MIP is more appropriate for this proposal than a Signal Request. This recommendation is for the following reasons:  This is a significant change to the current voting process in the Maker Protocol and, therefore, would probably benefit from the more extended RFC period and voting period that a MIP undergoes rather than a Signal Request. While Signal Requests can make changes in the Maker Protocol, they can be overridden by subsequent Signal Requests and MIPs, as noted by @rune. For example, a MIP author could write a MIP that involved selling MKR to raise funds to exclude itself or its subproposals from being covered by this Signal Request. An example of this kind of MIP could be seen in recent MIPs intended to exclude themselves from a potential collateral onboarding block if it passed. \u201c2/3\u201d would need to be better defined as it is not customary for all MKR to vote at every stage of the governance process. Is it 2/3 of voters on a Signal Request, 2/3 of MKR voting on a Governance Poll, 2/3 of all MKR, all or a combination of the above? If a related issue were to ever be inserted in an Executive Vote under emergency/urgent situations the approval voting system does not allow for a 2/3 distinction to be made as a condition for passage of an Executive Vote.  Therefore, we will change this vote to an Informal Poll. We would be happy to assist with formatting a MIP if required, please reach out to @MIP-Editors, who can advise on formatting. ",

Based on the \u201cCapital Raise\u201d debate and these proposals, it would be great (and super useful for the community) to have a post or some kind of document where the situation is presented in the most pedagogical way possible.
