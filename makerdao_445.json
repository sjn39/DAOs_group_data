Currently, the platform-threads are summarizing the onchain actions of the Recognized Delegates. This gives a good overview of the results of our thinking process, but it is not giving any hints about what is going on before we make our decisions. I wonder if it makes sense to give some updates about my thinking process before as well. Before I start spamming this post with updates, I\u2019d like to find out if you think this is helpful or not. I would also like to have this as something where the community interacts with me as a delegate as well. The biggest risk I see currently: this may get super messy with multiple topics getting active discussions - but maybe this can be handled by redirecting them into (existing, new) dedicated threads? Topics that would get covered are obviously things that are going to hit onchain soon - MIPs, Signal Requests, but probably also things that are even far before this stage. So\u2026 WDYT? ",

                    "content": "Some updates on recent things that are going through my mind right now:  Strategic Finance CU Application  I think this is a very important addition to our Core Unit stack. I don\u2019t share the fear of this being the Core Unit responsible for our overall strategy; they will provide us with really important tools for budgets, forecasting and strategic alignment. That\u2019s it - they won\u2019t be responsible for the strategy but for tools to execute on that. @Aes already has a high reputation and I am certain he will drive this Core Unit in the right direction. The FUD about @SebVentures being the puppeteer sucks and puts us in a bad light.  Maker Talent CU Application  Really nice to see such a vivid discussion on the forum about this proposal. I have to admit I am not convinced we really need Talent Aquisition as an own CoreUnit so I will need to do some interviews with some CU facilitators before making a decision. On the other hand: as we will need to scale up peoplewise every little help on getting more staff into the system is good - so the investment might be worth the risk. But for sure this CU would be among the first to scale down if we run in deep trouble.  Signal Request: adjusting  flap-parameters  The current flap-mechanics are bad - we are losing a lot of money due to the high discount and the costs for participating are so high that we see very few keepers here. Unfortunately this cannot get fixed by just turning some knobs. I believe both actions - decreasing the beg and increasing the bump - may drive out even more keepers. @dmitri.z made some good points in this thread (and also in the discussions I had with him this summer while preparing this Signal Request). Currently I would not vote in favour for changing any of these parameters. The only real way out of this (and imho we have to do that at some point anyway) is going for Liquidations 2.0 style on MKR burn auctions - replacing the flap with the clap.  Signal Request: D3M for Compound  I am a huge fan of the D3M. So that\u2019s a good reason to support this initiative. But given the fact that we barely utilize the D3M for AAVE right now I am a bit hesitant to really support prioritizing this now.  We need to be fine with going for a lower bar for this component to be worth the effort - there is no huge majority for that. Also, I am not sure if this falls into the category of micromanaging the Protocol Engineering CU - but I guess @Derek would speak up if he does not like the procedure   End of Year I was shocked to learn that yesterdays G&R call was the last one for this year. I am going to stick around here and on discord nevertheless, hope I can get some more people into my Schuppi Office Hour next week  If not: see you in 2022 - the year of MakerDao  ",

But for sure this CU would be among the first to scale down if we run in deep trouble.   From my experience I can say that when a project is in deep trouble, the first thing you do is to downsize\u2026 as a consequence, many people (also people that you thought were loyal, people you really need, and they sometimes are key to save the project) they start looking for other opportunities, as they see the boat sinking and they don\u2019t want to put their families at risk. Because of this, the function of a Talent CU becomes even more relevant, as you need to find new resources to save the project, re-assign people to new roles; and protect, as much as you can, the image/brand of the DAO towards the outside and future growth. IMO We are growing, we have good basis and everything indicates that we will keep on growing. We might have different needs across the year? Yes. All the projects will skyrocket as forecasted? Can\u2019t promise but we hope. In any case, Let\u2019s prepare scenarios for growth and success!  ",

With respect to a D3M for Compound, we had the signal request from GFXLabs recently so it would be good to hear from the Compound team on their thoughts in order to gather community sentiment in the lead-up to an on-chain vote, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re aware of but not actively working on right now.
