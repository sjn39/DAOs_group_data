                    "content": "The Rates Working Group is looking for feedback from governance on how to proceed with the stablecoin vaults. In particular, the lowest collateralization stablecoin vaults will start dropping below 100% collateralization ratio (CR) on December 19th, 2020 at the current rate of 4%. To see why this is an issue please review the most recent G&R call (~57 mins in). I will attempt to summarize the pros and cons of each option below. NOTE This post has been edited after the failure of Option 3 to secure enough MKR in the governance poll. I\u2019ve added 2 options based on feedback - Do Nothing and Option 1 variants which are reflected in the new governance poll.  Do Nothing In the do nothing option, MKR would be burned and stablecoin vaults will become undercollateralized.  Option 1 - Keep Raising the Surplus Buffer In this option we let Stability Fees continue to accrue and increase the surplus buffer so we don\u2019t end up burning MKR only to re-mint it later. The reason is that fees collected after 100% CR are virtual in the sense that, when the vault goes to auction, the revenue collected will be deducted to cover the bad debt. If we had previously burned this revenue it may result in a debt auction. Variant A) Keep Stability Fees at 4% Variant B) Lower Stability Fees to something still above 0%  Pros  We continue to collect fees from newer vaults.   Cons  The lower the CR, the less likely vault owners will close their own positions. Auction inefficiencies may cost us some money - even with auctions V2. We aren\u2019t burning MKR.   Option 2 - Lower the Stablecoin Stability Fees towards 0% In this option we will lower the fees towards 0%. Initially we would move the fees down to 2% with the expectation of lowering fees further as we approach 100% CR.  Pros  Higher chance of vaults closing themselves out.   Cons  We miss out on fees from newer vaults.   Option 3 - Migrate Users to a new Vault Type This is the option discussed in the call where at the threshold of 100% CR for leading vaults, we set the debt ceiling and stability fees on USDC-A/TUSD-A/etc to 0, and open a new vault type USDC-C/TUSD-B/etc with the same parameters and some positive debt ceiling. To be clear this will not result in any immediate action. We will schedule the new vaults and DC/SF to 0 whenever the leading vaults reach 100% CR which will occur approximately on Dec 19th.  Pros  Maximizes fee collection while minimizing the amount of vaults that need to go to auction.   Cons  Technical complexity - there is a fair bit of work involved with rolling out new vaults. We are bloating the vault types for a possibly one-time event. We may have to keep doing this if Dai doesn\u2019t return to $1.   Poll     Option 1 - Keep Raising the Surplus Buffer Option 2 - Lower the Stablecoin Stability Fees towards 0% Option 3 - Create a new Vault Type Abstain     0 voters     This signal request will run until Thursday, October 29th, and can be extended if there is not enough activity or consensus. Next step is an on-chain governance poll followed by the Rates Working Group implementing whatever course of action wins. ",

                    "content": "I have had to think about this one somewhat. I am going to abstain for the following reasons.   Raising the surplus buffer only makes it so that we don\u2019t buy MKR high and sell it low if the protocol loses money.  I consider this unlikely - there are lots of reasons to raise the surplus buffer - what is going on with the USDC LR 101 vaults isn\u2019t one of them. .   Lowering stability fees.   One could put this to 0 to buy as much time as possible but basically all this does is allow free minting at 1.01.   From a system loss perspective it probably is the best option but it doesn\u2019t clear the debt and also gives the system no fees.   I have been for a new vault but not at the same 1.01LR.  Also it isn\u2019t going to migrate anything.   Let\u2019s put this and my CC comments in perspective. The bet here is that \u2018at some point\u2019 in the future DAI will trade lower than 1.01 with some liquidity and these positions can either be liquidated or closed out without the system losing money and possibly \u2018in profit\u2019.    This is the bet that has been taken and 1% is the only buffer we have.   Let be clear this 1% buffer IS only active if the DAI PEG price is 1 not 1.01 - at 1.01 there is NO buffer and any fees being generated by these vaults are \u2018as I said in the CC\u2019 an accounting \u2018trick\u2019 simply because if these vaults were auctioned right now the current price is 1.008USDC for 1DAI.    This ignores the fact if these were auctioned/closed they would have to source DAI liquidity from \u2018somewhere\u2019 probably driving DAI price up again. The idea that we have till 12/19/2020 magically somehow is premised on an idea that DAI is at PEG with 400M of liquidity to satify closing of these positions.    I am thinkig the likelihood of this event happening to be quite low.   But \u2018there is a chance\u2019 even if it is growing lower every day. The right thing to do might be to simply lower the SF on this vault and don\u2019t allow others to be opened.  (i.e. if another vault type is created - or a vault structure I would suggest a structure as I have advoccated previously [Signal Poll] Use multiple stablecoin (e.g. USDC) vaults with different LR/DC combinations to manage value/price/risk exposure ) The whole point of these is to \u2018attempt\u2019 to manage the PEG with larger amount of capital at different price points (LRs) - not to lump everything into a heap at 1.01 which is exactly what was done. Right now without a buyer who would take this 400M USDC off our hands for even 399M DAI the protocol is stuck.   The only reason the PEG is at 1.01 is because there is still DC open in any of the LR 101 vaults.   reduce DCs on these vaults to 0 and replace them with vaults at 101.5 and the PEG price is going to rise.  Why?  Because put simply it is easier for people to just use a vault to get DAI and abandon it vs. buying on open market.    These vault owners get a kind of free DAI short position bonus (i.e\u2026 if for any reason DAI drops to 1 or below - they get to close - possibly at a profit).   Unless something crazy happens I am skeptical the markets are going to provide liquidity for these vaults to close particularly when they can make more farming. I don\u2019t see this changing in 1, 3, 6 or even 12 months here.   Now one can ask a better question (I hear @rune in my head on this one).   Why is it bad for the protocol to have all this USDC backing DAI at 1.01?    If effect if we take away the SF on this to make the facility DAI neutral to the surplus accumulation this vault with infinite DC acts as a decentralized PSM which will buy below 1.01 and sell above it. Turn this around another way.   Why not give this vault a very LARGE DC and lower the LR even further.   Vaults under water won\u2019t be able to borrow much more.   Eventually move this LR to 100 or even say 100.2-100.4 and simply let the PEG move down even further.   In the loosest sense this facility and approach has been VERY good at managing the PEG at 1.01 +/-.003 The prime issue with the system here is lack of generating any return from the now 400M USDC in vaults.     If there was a suggestion it would be to take this USDC and pair it with DAI and drop it in the most liquid and lucrative farming contracts to earn some return for the system.   If people are going to give us their USDC in vaults - why not put it to work.   (I understand this is in complete contradiction to how Maker works with vaults - but if people give you 400M USDC to do something with - perhaps the onus is on us to DO something with it). It is a good thing to have 400M USDC in case the PEG ever does drop below 1, and if RWA comes on line and wants to swap their DAI for USD. The only issues for Maker here are:  Accumulated SF will eventually eat the 1% - so lets put this off as long as possible. Earning return on this USDC vs. letting it sit there doing nothing. The already taken on risk of blacklisting.  ",

                    "content": "    FourthStreet:  It is more an issue of you not offering solutions to the problems you see or directing clearly to solutions.   I\u2019m not sure why you say that - you didn\u2019t bother to check or you don\u2019t consider my proposals \u201csolutions\u201d? Here\u2019s one solution to help with the peg:     0% SF to go long on ETH Governance       I suggested that MakerDAO buys ETH (as a protocol reserve/peg control) and that was rejected. If MakerDAO won\u2019t do that, why not just let users do it themselves and help them to do that while maintaining the peg.  My idea is to have a guaranteed 0% SF but just as long as the minted DAI is used to buy more ETH (possibly recursively until the limit) - no free farming :). Would that be technically possible using a special vault or some restrictions? We could also set LR to 125% and the OSM delay to\u2026      Here\u2019s another one when ETH price was $352:     Should we print 100M DAI to buy ETH? Signal Requests       We are approaching a point where fixing the peg with stablecoins won\u2019t be possible without having a great majority of collateral locked in centralized stablecoins. From past experience, it\u2019s clear to me  that the problem (peg) won\u2019t go away if we add just another 100M of stablecoins to the books.  Instead of waiting a month or so for this to happen and losing more market share and reputation because of being way off the peg - I suggest a new approach. Let\u2019s print 100M DAI, buy ETH and deposit it\u2026      And another one:     Turn ETH liquidations off until the peg is restored Risk       Here\u2019s another \u201cradical\u201d solution to the peg problem but I firmly believe that there is no easy solution that can bring the DAI price down.  This measure is, of course, not always applicable but considering that ETH is far from overvalued by any calculation and it is relatively stable / growing in the last 6 months - now it might be a good time to use it.  Maybe there are alternatives to when to turn the ETH liquidations on -  i.e. in X months or until ETH price is $XXX or\u2026      I admit that the solutions rely heavily on ETH, but the current solutions also rely heavily on centralized stablecoins. There have also been proposals from other people (TRFM, PSM\u2026) that I supported. I cannot offer a solution to \u201cStablecoin Action Plan\u201d which assumes that we must keep stablecoins in one way or another as a dominant peg-keeping mechanism. ",

I might help to add recursive collateral like aDAI, cDAI, yDAI, yUSD. I know that there has been a vote on aUSDC, cUSDC, and yUSD. I think the only way out of this mess is to onboard as many uncorrelated assets as quickly as possible to be able to get the peg back to $1. I was inspired after reading Tarun Chitra tweet, \u201cAfter @AseemSood_ schooled me on the convexity diff. in payoffs between term vs. whole life insurance, it is clear that DeFi insurance products with continuously reinvested premiums & transparent ROI calcs will make duration insurance swaps/refinancing way better than TradFi.\u201d This is why I wrote a proposal that may serve as a launchpad to think tank this idea\u2019s merits some more.

In order to support this, I would like to see a model of the assumed auction inefficiencies in order to understand if they actually outweigh the foregone fees. For example, if we forgo 1% in fees on $100M of vaults that are still over the 100% threshold, is that number likely to be less than the auction inefficiencies? I am having trouble understanding how auction inefficiencies would result in greater than 1% discounts on stablecoins. ",

The difference between the average and the leading edge is not that big as over half of the loans are within .05% of the leading edge (~5 days of fee burn). So regardless of whether we do the average or the leading edge the time frame is roughly the same give or take a week. Here is a detailed breakdown created by @Primoz and @monet-supply  : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Kdfdsx5zu09yL7XBQVc0N37sBKmEkWNuFbmo4_MfZA/edit?usp=sharing To answer your specific question about 100M mark. We would be missing out on around 0.2% or 200K in Stability Fees according to the chart. But it\u2019s not really that straight forward because the further down we venture from 100% the higher the likely hood of having to go to auctions which if the leading edge goes too far we may end up loosing more than the 0.2%. Another benefit from keeping a large chunk of vaults at just slightly above 100% CR is that they will act as a buffer to prevent Dai from swinging too far in the other direction if and when that happens.

It means:  Dai will no longer be backed by $1 worth of assets. MKR is burned in the short term but minted in the long term, which means we pay two sets of auction inefficiencies.  So in terms of both keeping the implicit promises made by the Maker Protocol, and in terms of total monetary gain, Maker is worse off. It might be worth highlighting the reasons why doing nothing is a bad idea though. ",
