Tons of ideas and use cases to get you started:  Some ideas from Privacy in Payments (More in the link):   How to transfer Dai from the protocol in such a way that it goes to its intended recipient, but where others are not able to see the eventual destination address.

I guess Tornado.Cash could to some degree clean DAI, but not MKR. Would it be possible to have a clean Maker governance voting record? Why: imagine a scenario in the not too distant future where various factions of Delegated Voting has turned non-constructive and are only flinging dirt at each other. In that case it is better to have a more anonymous governance voting as it makes it easier to concentrate on the actual issues at hand and not on who-voted-what earlier. ",

Optionally voting without revealing the voting addresses. This would include the cold wallet used to deposit MKR in the Chief (not sure if this is even possible.) And the hot wallet used to vote (might be more possible?)   Voting without revealing the poll option / executive voted for. Pretty sure this is also quite difficult.   How to attach a pseudonymous identity to a voting address without revealing the true identity covered by the pseudonymous one. (This is more in the realm of general op-sec.)   How to combine the above with delegation? How to ensure delegates are safe from influence but still credible and trustworthy?   Specifically any tooling that may be of beenfit to the darkspell mechanism described here: MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism.   How to transfer DAI from the protocol in such a way that it goes to its intended recipient, but where governance is not able to see the eventual destination address.   A method to pay DAI into the protocol in such a way that the primary address of the sender is not visible.   (Speculative) A way to provably stake MKR on something (an outcome, a specific smart contract construct, a MIP, etc) without publically revealing the address of the staker.   ",
