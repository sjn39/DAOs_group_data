Since the legislation around stablecoins is becoming more and more restrictive, the risk premium for stablecoins should automatically increase by i.e. 1% every month regardless of the peg. ",

I think better question becomes what happens if 25-50% of all USDC is deposited into Maker and starts hurting USDC liquidity.   I honestly have to think this is good for centre btw since they can take the USD deposited and converted to USDC and earn interest on it. BUT this is and has been a concern.   I would add that given I have a USDC vault I would be one joining in a lawsuit against centre and the government for freezing my lawfully obtained USDC there.  It would be a hell of a case at 200-500M btw. They would do better simply by issuing some sort of warning with guidance on what is acceptable use than to just hammer down on 20% of the USDC liquidity. ",

The MakerDAO system only exists for as long as these transactions can remain final and true. The moment collateral that can be manipulated is allowed into the system, the whole idea of a trustless CDO is not possible. Now I don\u2019t believe USDC or Tether will destroy DEFI, but rather create a new problem that the space will have to deal with. An increasingly globalized economy will have governments all around the world interacting with each other in order to hold control of the system. The system has to look towards introducing a varied and even approach to currencies rather than weighing one greater than the other. Nothing is failproof in the system, but with proper risk management, we can work towards greater longevity. ",

Its really not a realistic threat.  They would first give a warning and innocent people would have a chance to unwind their CDPs.  The problem would be finding something that could replace the USDC liquidity- which is planned to be real world assets. Until we have that, we should use USDC to restore the peg as its the least bad option.  Only other one is having unbacked Dai - which creates its own set of risks too. ",

Governments (most of which have no problems p***ing in our pool, since we\u2019re not under their thumb) have been known to just arbitrarily do things sometimes, and crypto is just as subject to this as anything else. By allowing collateral to depend upon a single organization, a single point of failure, that makes it very easy for a government to target that single point of failure and cause massive damage to the Maker Vault Credit System. Someone in another thread pointed out that USDC collateral accounts for ~30% of Dai currently in circulation. If Centre ate it, at the time of writing that\u2019s upwards of 175m Dai that is no longer backed by anything. Even at the conservative estimate given in the OP of ~20% of all collateral, that is still ~115m Dai. In either case, that would be a huge problem. Exposing ourselves to that risk for the sake of quickly stabilizing the peg, and then not reflecting that risk in the LR and SF, and then continuing to crank up the DC on it was shortsighted, and we should not have done it.
