First step, we finished the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d of OST-1.The Private offering consists of an offer of LP Interests to Non.US person(a LP from Hongkong), pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. We have issued the registered asset OST-1 on omnilayer and also signed a set of legal documents such as Private Placement Memorandom and LPA with the LP to make sure that OST-1 is representing the ownership of LP interests, both legally and technically.    Next step, we liquidize the OST-1 tokens owned by the Hongkong LP by listing them on MERJ exchange. MERJ Exchange Limited, formerly Trop-X (Seychelles) Limited, was incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles in 2011. The exchange went live in 2012. MERJ Exchange Limited is the operator of MERJ Exchange, the only licensed securities exchange in the Republic of Seychelles. MERJ has established and administers rules for the listing, trading, clearing and settlement of securities and other financial instruments. 2)Since MERJ exchange only support the digital securities with ERC20 protocol, we then issued OST-1 with ERC20 standard. Our tech team is verifying the contract on Etherscan, will get back to you soon. 3)You may check out the trading volumn on here.https://www.uprets.io/#/events/merj. We agree that the trading column on security exchange is relatively lower than Utility tokens which are traded on major crypto exchanges. This is a common problem for real world assets and security tokens. However, since OST-1 represents real estate asset, the price of real estate is not as fluctuated as cryptos(BTC,ETH). As the collateral provider, we will provide other liquidization solutions aside from onchain auctions, such as buyback the OST-1 tokens. To onboard real-world assets as collateral in the MakerDAO system, the liquidation and settlement is always a big issue. We wish to explore with the MakerDAO community. ",

If you plan to have OST-1 on Maker while the token is still illiquid (something like daily transaction volume < expected vault debt ceiling), the onboarding will indeed be more custom that other assets. We are already working on real estate onboarding with New Silver and 6S Capital. For real world assets, the current expected way of doing things is to create a SPV where investors (including the asset originator) are providing equity and Maker is providing debt (leverage). The asset part will be OST-1 tokens. We use a look-through method to assess the collateral ratio. The SPV can be a smart contract in your case. It\u2019s more or less doing a REIT in this case. ",

                    "content": "Dear @UPRETS_Real_Estate , The process for MIP6 applications for off-chain collateral, so called real-wold assets, has been under significant review by the teams involved in collateral onboarding (RWF, CES, Growth and incubating LTS and LOVE). See more for collateral onboarding process. The goal of this process update is to provide MKR tokenholders and respective delegates a comprehensive view of MIP6-RWA applications from a credit, legal and technology perspective so tokenholders can make a more informed decision before moving applications through the execution of the onboarding process after greenlight. As part of this review, MIP67 and the underlying Methodology for structured finance transactions were written to provide applicants with a more comprehensive set of guidelines and requirements so MIP6 applications are fit for purpose and closer to a state where they could be executed, if prioritised by tokenholders during polls. MIP67 is now part of the MIP6 process. It is designed to fill the gaps in the MIP6 application for RWAs. Our domain team is aligned to the approved MIP67 process and Methodology. We are asking MIP6-RWA applicants to express whether they will retrofit their MIP6 applications in line with MIP67/Methodology guidelines. We ask applicants to express their intention by Mon 9 May at 12pm UTC. The collateral application template is located here: MIPs Portal. Status of MIP6 applications that do not express their interest by 9 May will be considered \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from a MIP6 collateral onboarding point of view by the aforementioned Core Units and reflected in the CSI. We understand that once applicants express their intentions, there will be a period for drafting and updating documentation of the newly proposed MIP6 applications. Our teams will be available to provide guidance to applicants during this time. Kind regards, William. ",
