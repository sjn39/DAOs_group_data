The call depth is limited to 1024, but the Tangerine Whistle hardfork introduced EIP-150 with the \u201c63/64th rule\u201d. That rule makes it not realistic to exhaust the 1024 limit with the current and historical block gas limits. However having 2^31-1 would allow removing it entirely \u2013 or in practice combine the various checks into a few branches. A CALL costing 1 gas would allow 1138 call depth, while 4 gas would terminate after 1021 depth. Note that a call currently costs as at least 100 gas (EIP-2929). ",
