It can handle negative numbers because unlike plain RLP it can use the ABI schema with the bit length and signedness of each element. One downside is that negative numbers have to be represented full-width e.g. ffffff for an int24 with value -1. Applying a conventional compression algorithm to the RLP could help with this, but the gains would probably be small in the average case. One advantage of using RLP over using a conventional dictionary-based compression algorithm over a batch of calldata is that it\u2019s fair with respect to whether a call is situated near the beginning or end of the batch when gas is charged per byte after compression. It may also be easier to calculate the gas fee. Reproduced from my reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/vxqm92/calldata_compression_via_rlp/ ",
