Motivation The Maker Protocol holds over $5.4B in stablecoins earning zero yield. There are multiple efforts underway (short-term bonds, IVs, RWA, Multi-chain) to invest the majority of stablecoin exposure into growth opportunities. Our aim is to begin experimenting with generating yield on balance sheet assets and support DAI liquidity/utility, creating a new revenue stream for the protocol. As DeFi is evolving quickly, we should continue researching, investigating, and experimenting with DeFi-native yield-generation strategies.  Special Purpose Fund Name Makershire Hathaway  Scope & Work Credentials  Scope  Invest protocol capital to improve DAI liquidity, utility, and diversify our revenue streams Improve DAI liquidity/utility. For example:  Bootstrap liquidity of DAI on L2s and other networks by providing liquidity and participating in DAI yield farms Providing Liquidity on DEXs for ETH/DAI, ETH/MKR, MKR/DAI etc.   Experiment with strategies with the goal of automating them later. For instance:  Rate arbitrage on term-lending product (recursively lending on Protocol A and borrowing on Protocol B) Providing liquidity to an option DeFi Protocol   Earning yield on ETH through staking, providing liquidity and/or liquidity farming No management or performance fee is charged  Note - Gas for operating the pool will be taken from profits  Risk profile  Strategies are expected to be mainly done in DAI or $-based stablecoins but can also be done in ETH (incl. derivatives), and MKR. ETH exposure could be hedged or not Positions may require high concentration in situations where we seek to bootstrap liquidity or take advantage of temporary high-yield opportunities The pool might allocate to protocols that haven\u2019t passed a comprehensive risk and smart contract assessment by respective CUs For both whitelisted (Ethereum and direct L2s) and non-whitelisted domains, SF CU will provide clear guidance and limits, informed by PE, Risk, and Lending Oversight CUs   Operating Guidelines  MakerDAO community can contribute to the management of the pool by discussing ideas in the Makershire Hathaway Discord channel and posting them to a Google Form (link to be added) Investment strategies will be implemented on-chain for transparency A live Dune dashboard will provide insight to the extent possible into the performance of the fund Further improvements will be made on an ongoing basis to reporting quality and to increase the frequency of information availability Monthly reporting will provide information on the strategies pursued and the results A successful signal request or an unilateral decision by Strategic Finance or Risk CU can be used to wind down the fund. The fund will be wound down within six months thereafter to minimize slippage and avoid frontrunning. The remaining DAI will be transferred to the Surplus Buffer   Funding Breakdown  The total funding will be done in one step when this prroposal is approved 12 months following the approval of the proposal, all funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer and a full post-mortem will be posted for the community to evaluate and decide if the project is worth expanding, maintaining, or shutting down.

We feel it is nevertheless important to get quantifiable feedback from community on this one hence the following pool (only informative).    Are you in favour of Makershire Hathaway SPF?  yes no abstain     0 voters     The current SPF proposal will reduce the Surplus Buffer by 10M. While it is not per se an expense (as the fund remains for MakerDAO), it might be not ideal. Another solution would be to take $30M MKR from the DSPauseProxy contract (~15k MKR) and use it as collateral on Aave to borrow DAI. That would keep the Surplus Buffer the same, provide Aave rewards on MKR deposit and DAI borrowing while the borrowing fees will most likely accrue to the Aave D3M. The cons are that it would add execution risks (oracle on Aave, price drop of MKR, \u2026) and would increase the amount of MKR able to be borrowed. On the later point, we think that with the current delegate system the risk is quite limited but that should probably be discussed.    Do you prefer using 10M DAI from the SB or using $30M of MKR as collateral  10M DAI from the SB $30M of MKR as collateral Both are fine None Abstain     0 voters     ",

On the Governance Security front, it would be safer to deposit MKR on a protocol that has borrow limits on MKR to protect us from borrowed MKR being used as part of a Governance attack. Compound Governance recently voted to cap the amount of MKR that can be borrowed at any one time to 5000 MKR. Obviously DAI borrow rates on Compound tend to be higher so that would need to be considered.

A core unit is a ton of work and the market in crypto is 24/7, so is there a strategy to set yourselves up for success and not burn out? Only asking because I think this initiative makes sense and after feedback is incorporated could start off quite well. Yet, IMHO an open market team needs not to be a distraction, to @Doo_StableLab 's point. I\u2019m idealistic, but a mandate to hand off to a bigger firm that manages inventory all day with a DAO profit-share seems more promising for the bigger picture. If you\u2019ll humor me, why do active management instead of a DAO native structure? ",

I think the Makeshire Hathaway name is clever but perhaps a little misleading.  The emphasis should be placed on experimentation, not on maximizing returns or even protecting capital. The question of how much overhead this would be to SF CU is a good one.   Though there is no fee, the protocol would be paying for any extra labor costs needed to get this running.  Would the SF team be requesting extra budget to implement this project?  Based on how this proposal is laid out, I get the idea that SF feels they can handle this without budget increases and without compromising their mandate. If I understand it correctly and as long as we strive not to turn this into a huge management expense (+1 for automation), I am generally supportive of this initiative.  The examples of strategies listed in the scope section have already been brought up as ideas at various times in the past.  I see this proposal as a request for flexibility in trying out the many ideas that get thrown out there.  The alternative is going through the MIP process for every single idea and having most of them go nowhere for various reasons. ",

Looks like it\u2019s just a multisig with no protections or a legal structure. If something like this is done in a way where there isn\u2019t a hard guarantee of decentralization, then it\u2019s basically something like a personal donation. If that\u2019s the case then think it\u2019s pretty likely there are big tax and regulatory problems with the way it\u2019s proposed right now. I can see an argument that this is just an experiment, and we probably have other multisigs similar to this elsewhere in the decentralized workforce - but IMO from a regulatory perspective i think we cross a line when the money is put in a multisig specifically for the sake of later returning the funds + profits. Not worth to take that kind of risk for an experiment. I think a very basic mechanism to make it decentralized could be e.g. having a delay on actions by the multisig, and the ability for maker governance to intervene and seize all the funds before the action goes through. Apologies in advance if something like that is already in the proposal and I just missed it. ",

However, I agree with some of the concerns raised in this thread. Possibly part of the problem here could be framing - I can understand why the prospect of Maker launching its own in-house private investment fund controlled by a multisig is unsettling. On the other hand, that doesn\u2019t really seem to be the medium or long-term vision here. As @Aes notes (emphasis mine):     Aes:  Experiment with strategies with the goal of automating them later. For instance:  Rate arbitrage on term-lending product (recursively lending on Protocol A and borrowing on Protocol B) Providing liquidity to an option DeFi Protocol    It doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to characterise this as \u201can unrestricted trading fund by people with no financial incentive to make gains or avert losses\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s a pretty limited experiment (on the scale of the Maker protocol) to work out how to best put the protocol\u2019s resources to use in the long term, managed by CUs with pretty clear incentives to avert losses. Of course, if we wanted to pay a professional investment team to manage this for us (addressing some of the criticisms), we would end up paying through the roof for them and it suddenly becomes a pretty pricey experiment. Also, an external team doesn\u2019t have any incentive to work out how to automate strategies for Maker. I\u2019m personally happy to see how Strategic Finance CU goes, and in any case they have already set out the kinds of positions they are likely to take. ",

This request could be viewed as onboarding an uncollateralized loan to the SF team for unclarified strategies and unknown expected returns, giving it a 10 million dollar debt ceiling, and bypassing the scrutiny of the COB process and analyses. Nevertheless, I believe that in a rapidly changing defi landscape, giving some latitude to the CUs to experiment is important or this protocol will not be able to compete with more agile players.  If automation strategies are found through this initiative, there is a lot of potential value to be realized.  We should recognize that there is work to be done here and if the CUs are willing to do this work, they should be applauded for it.  Their salaries are not being raised and they are not taking any fees except to cover transaction costs. To resolve the concerns raised, we could go down the route of more rigorous vetting and safeguarding.  Certainly some amount of this would be prudent but I fear we regulate this too heavily and end up adding overhead and costs that defeat the initial purpose of flexible experimentation. In pondering another solution, I was thinking perhaps the 10 mil being requested is the real sticking point as larger amounts construe an intention to profit rather than experiment.  My conjecture is that the hope was to cover costs to doing this through returns (at 10 mil, each % return only equates to 100k).  So my question to the no votes - would you be more amenable to doing this if the initial amount requested was reduced and what amount would you be ok with? ",

There needs to be some fundamental oversight/control of capital intensive risk taking activities.  DeFi is meant to be \u2018Trustless\u2019 so how can this initiative be structured to approach that key goal?  In real world trading firms, risk oversight is a KEY KEY issue.

Personally, I think that talking about a prop desk is not helpful. Is it risk-taking? Yes it is, but most banks are involved in risk taking through their treasury department without going all the way of setting up their own prop hedge fund. As usual, it\u2019s a grey area. I believe SF\u2019s initiative goes in the direction of developing an active treasury strategy that includes not only the outsourcing of USDC to (quasi) risk-equivalent real-world use cases, but also crypto-native ones. I think that, given the direction DeFi is taking and Maker\u2019s role, it is a relevant question. Risk Controls: as @Eumenes states several times, I think that having appropriate checks and balances to ensure that actors are i) staying within their mandate, ii) avoiding both internal and external conflicts of interest is super important. As @Rob states, many among us have money invested in other protocols and we should ensure that actors involved are as transparent as possible about their exposures and how those could be impacted by Maker\u2019s actions - at the expense of their reputation. At this quantum level, it is not an issue, but it is something we should definitely consider. The risk of front running is real, so we should create controlling framework that avoid the ConstitutionDAO-like situation of us telling the market exactly what we would do, but I am sure this can be figured out. Decentralisation: a separate topic is about what should be run internally vs externally. In my personal opinion, in the long run, it would be more advisable to have Treasury Management Protocols to offer those services to DAOs in fully transparent ways. We are not there yet, and this initiative should be seen as experimental (and experimental in size) before the industry would get there. In the longer term, I would expect teams (or protocols) active in transparent bidding to provide decentralised services to MakerDAO in order to manage part of the risk and liquidity, and MakerDAO being the judge, controller, and censor.

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  Wait, there are many ways to gain return without exposing oneself to impermanent loss. In addition, usually for this kind of proposal, a team with track record in profitable trading should come with concrete plan how to conduct a profitable trade?   To be clear, there will be no active trading , the intent is to earn yield and support DAI liquidity and utility as mentioned in the sentence summary.     Doo_StableLab:  If the team is just looking for exploring some profitable ideas, the team can experiment with much smaller such as $10k or even their own capital instead of risking the protocol\u2019s $10 million.   If the protocol wants a return on assets, it will need to take some risk as we will not be donating our personal profits to the protocol. DAOs across the industry are already pursuing these strategies at scale, some with funds over $500M and others just purely sitting in ETH. We believe it is time for the protocol to start earning a return on dormant assets, especially with US inflation at 8.5%. As stated, one of the key points of this initiative is to help aid liquidity and utilization of these tokens in the entire DeFi landscape. Such goals are simply not possible with 10K DAI. Additionally, because this is just a step in our overarching vision for optimization and utilization of Maker & DAI, we find the proposed size to be a happy middle ground where yield generation is both meaningful and worthwhile, and something that will provide the DAO experience with protocol-owned liquidity, hard-data, and a roadmap to automating such strategies. Finally, as @traster_tray stated, there will be an utmost focus on transparency as highlighted in the operating guidelines; including a live Dune dashboard of the fund, full on-chain transparency, and recurring reporting (weekly summary and comprehensive monthly performance analysis). As he/she also mentioned, there are no fees charged.     Puzzler:  It was no good to simply buy treasury bills with no track record. Why is complex investment ok with no track record? Or is there a track record? Who makes the decisions about what to do? Is there a specific person?   This proposal is independent from any treasury bill or short-term bond investment proposal. We strongly support any initiative to invest in short-term credit and have been collaborating with multiple parties to bring this to fruition. While short-term credit investments are significantly more scalable due to the TAM of investable opportunities and associated markets, there are significant fees related to custody, converting stables to fiat, investment management fees, and centralization risks moving funds off-chain. Long-term, we believe many TradFi markets will at least partially move on-chain, and it would benefit the DAO signficantly to start building expertise in protocol owned liquidity and on-chain yield generation. However, this is something we have yet to see, unlike many of the lucrative DeFi oriented strategies out there today. Regarding decision making, SF will be building a framework in collaboration with Risk and the currently incubated Lending Oversight CU to evaluate opportunities. We will continuously seek to source these ideas from the community, and will post the framework for community feedback prior to the formal submission window to build consensus and align. Any allocation decision will need to be approved by SF, Risk, and Lending Oversight.     AliceinMKRland:  Maybe I missed it, but who decides how this money is invested? Is it a CU or an investment committee or the people on the multisig? Whoever IS in charge, can they disclose their holdings, conflicts, and experience investing on behalf of others? Do any of them have their various licenses to invest on behalf of others? This seems like it wasn\u2019t a finished draft?   Answered above and in the sentence summary. The scope is currently limited to ETH, MKR, stablecoins, and their associated derivatives (i.e. stETH). We are all long: ETH, stETH, and MKR.     CYJFC:  Will the folks doing this have their own capital at risk as well? I see no fees, so if they don\u2019t have an up side, do they at least have a down side? Considering this can go to 0 easier than a loan, are there any restrictions? This reads like a request for 10,000,000 for an unrestricted trading fund by people with no financial incentive to make gains or avert losses and maybe also have no history in asset management?   If our performance with the pool is not to the satisfaction of MKR holders, they should certainly take this into account when contemplating offboarding us. In the event this proposal does not pass, we still strongly support protocol owned liquidity and earning yield on balance sheet assets and would be happy to see additional proposals, presuming they come from trusted community members and retain the goal of long-term automation. As addressed previously, these funds will NOT be used for active trading. To re-iterate, the intent is to earn passive yield and most importantly, support DAI liquidity/utility. Most positions will likely be initiated and kept for the entire duration of the SPF. If the community believes we should have a management fee and/or performance fee, we will add one. However, given our mandate, nascency of the DeFi & yield-farming, and our existing MKR compensation, we did not feel this was necessary.     twblack88:   What\u2019s the plan for returning value to Maker? Just the one repayment at the end of the year? In the reporting list there is a mention of monthly updates, would you aim to return profits month-over-month or just the details of the fund performance?    The current plan is to re-invest profits back into positions to maximize (compound) yield and returns. The funds will be returned at the end of the year unless Governance decides to continue this initiative. We are open to returning profits on a monthly or quarterly basis if Governance decides, but believe it\u2019s suboptimal as returns will not be compounded and the SPF will incur higher transaction costs liquidating and transferring funds.     twblack88:  In general, what\u2019s the plan to keep the focus on each individual team\u2019s mandate? A core unit is a ton of work and the market in crypto is 24/7, so is there a strategy to set yourselves up for success and not burn out?   We seek to allocate capital into long term positions that require minimal management and that will be held for the duration of the trial period assuming yields remain attractive relative to alternative opportunities.     Traster_Tray:  Would the SF team be requesting extra budget to implement this project?   No, this project is not contingent on any future SF budget requests.     rune:  Maybe I missed it, but what protections does this proposal contain to ensure its goals are met in a way that is decentralized? Looks like it\u2019s just a multisig with no protections or a legal structure. If something like this is done in a way where there isn\u2019t a hard guarantee of decentralization, then it\u2019s basically something like a personal donation. If that\u2019s the case then think it\u2019s pretty likely there are big tax and regulatory problems with the way it\u2019s proposed right now. I can see an argument that this is just an experiment, and we probably have other multisigs similar to this elsewhere in the decentralized workforce - but IMO from a regulatory perspective i think we cross a line when the money is put in a multisig specifically for the sake of later returning the funds + profits. Not worth to take that kind of risk for an experiment. I think a very basic mechanism to make it decentralized could be e.g. having a delay on actions by the multisig, and the ability for maker governance to intervene and seize all the funds before the action goes through. Apologies in advance if something like that is already in the proposal and I just missed it.   The multi-sig implementation leverages MIP47 (see bottom of proposal), meaning that Governance will own the multi-sig. Under MIP47, Governance is able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time. If you believe this is insufficient, we are happy to create a legal and entity structure to support this iniative or any other sufficiently decentralized structure that the community supports. Regarding the decentralized nature of the proposal more broadly, we will re-iterate that the goal is to automate these strategies long-term. For example, we envision a future where x% of profits are used to buy back and burn MKR, y% are funneled into a MKR/ETH LP, z% are allocated into a ETH/DAI LP, etc.     MadShills:  Cool proposal AES and SF. There are some concerns on here about the ambiguity of the actual strategies and what you will do. One potential way to mitigate these concerns is to use a signal before you \u201cturn on\u201d a pool, or to have signals on your contemplated strategies. This may be a bit more of a headache operationally, but may be something you want to consider.   We considered this, but as @luca_pro mentioned below, we run the risk of being front-run if the community is provided advance notice of the SPF adding or removing liquidity. We will be hosting a community call shortly to discuss and collaborate with the community on the treasury allocation framework, but again to be clear, the opportunities are limited to ETH, MKR, DAI, and other stablecoins (primarily USDC).

Earn yield on stablecoins that otherwise earn a real return of -8.5% due to inflation  Bolster DAI liquidity Building expertise with the goal of automating strategies through smart contracts   Is this an unsupervised prop desk/hedge fund/slush fund?   No, please refer to the original proposal for further details, namely:  Strategies are low-risk and low complexity, with specific strategic aims and a view to automate and remove manual intervention In principle, full allocation to USDC is also a de facto prop-type of allocation, SPF intends to improve diversification and, on the margin, yield while remaining extremely prudent and transparent - a better comparison would be with a treasury desk of a bank, rather than a prop fund LOVE and Risk have effective veto, governance has multiple handbrakes in case of emergency, SPF managed from a governance-owned multisig SPF does not actually formally leave the surplus buffer (though it might temporarily reduce it on makerburn.com - to be worked with u/makerburn)     Could this start with smaller amount?   Given the objective of bolstering DAI liquidity, anything smaller than 10M DAI will not move the needle The SPF won\u2019t be fully invested on Day 1, it will be progressively rolled out following the proposed method of community input, discussion, and governance oversight   Who is the team that is going to manage this/why don\u2019t we hire qualified people/hire an external management team?   Strategic Finance will evaluate the strategies and allocations based on the community developed investment framework then implement with oversight from Risk and Lending Oversight Core Units These are low complexity strategies - the proposal aims to start fixing the enormous problem with low ROA at a low cost (0 increase in budget) i.e. operate at a high ROI Hiring specialized asset manager profiles would entail significantly higher upfront and recurring costs to the protocol for very little marginal benefit, considering the low complexity of the strategies proposed, and its on-chain specificities. Likely resulting in lower ROI compared to running it through an existing core unit External management teams would be disincentivized to find a way to automate the strategies and incentivized to take higher risks to earn more fees   Who decides the investment strategy?   We will be collaborating with the entire community to build the asset allocation framework and define the universe precisely   Do the management team have skin in the game?   Given that the proposal does not entail creating a prop fund, but rather professionalizing Maker\u2019s treasury desk, we don\u2019t feel like the ask about skin in the game is relevant If the community believes we should have a management fee and/or performance fee, we will add one. However, given our mandate, nascency of the DeFi & yield-farming, and our existing MKR compensation, we did not feel this was necessary   What\u2019s the plan for returning value?   12 months following the approval of the proposal, all funds will be returned to the Surplus   Will you be able to focus on it, will you need incremental budget?   No incremental budget is needed.   Is this decentralized enough?   Please see proposed multi-sig implementation that states we will use MIP47, i.e. governance-owned multisig wallet. If this is insufficiently decentralized, we are happy to implement a more decentralized alternative (and we should probably take a look at MIP47 if this is really the case)   Is anyone on the team conflicted?   The Strategic Finance team\u2019s biggest entanglement in this SPF will likely be with MKR and ETH. Any personal entanglements will be disclosed ahead of any strategies executing. Any community proposal will also be asked to disclose conflicts  ",

We should directionally be long experimentation and our coming capital raise will allow for us to return to our roots. Like it did for Amazon, a portfolio of inexpensive experiments will ultimately yield enormous, core opportunities that transform the business. Experimentation in on-chain yield generation is particularly topical. DAI competes with algo stables that have built-in, albeit potentially unsustainable yield. My gut says that if Maker offers to (some) DAI holders modest yields produced via \u201cinstitutionally managed\u201d liquidity strategies and other productive means (like RWAs, crypto loans etc.), market share would surge, more than off-setting the lost profit via the profit share with depositors. \u201cStaked\u201d DAI would start to feel like the US treasuries of DeFi. If the market is willing to lend to MakerDAO at the de facto risk-free rate, MakerDAO will be in a unique position to put on an epochal carry trade. Further, as RWF begins to build the bridge to traditional institutions, we\u2019d like such counter-parties to begin considering DAI as a destination rather than a means to an end. It is ultimately organic DAI demand, NOT mere circulation that matters. Whether institutional or retail, if your dollars in a bank account yield 1% annually, there is some threshold of deposit yield where holding DAI becomes a fiduciary imperative. ",

The current state is that there is nothing we can do here as SF CU and watch the battle to be lost. With this SPF we can try to push DAI by providing more liquidity and try stuff. Make DAI a better product on Optimism by allocating our capital, and earning a yield by doing so. ",

                    "content": "The following is my personal opinion, and does not reflect the views of my Core Unit. I have nothing but respect for the people behind this proposal, and I\u2019ve only had great experiences collaborating with them. I applaud their effort on this proposal. While I understand the ultimate the goal and intention of this proposal, of turning dormant assets into yield generating ones and improve Dai liquidity, I want to highlight a few concerns of mine regarding the specific implementation. My intention of highlighting these concerns are simply to foster meaningful discussion and ultimately help increase the overall robustness of the final implementation. I understand I am late to the party, but I haven\u2019t had the time to really look into this proposal until recently. First of all, I think it sends the wrong signal to the community that for example collateral partners have to go through a much more extensive due diligence process and risk assessment in order to launch a vault facility that would allow them to draw similar amounts of Dai, while this proposal sidesteps such processes, while effectively achieving the same. This proposal does not give any concrete answers to exactly what Dai will be invested in, how it will be invested, and the amounts, which is something that is core to our existing processes. So a concern of mine is that the 10M Dai will be transferred before it is clear what precisely it will be used for.     Aes:   Who decides the investment strategy?   We will be collaborating with the entire community to build the asset allocation framework and define the universe precisely    If the community is going to provide input on the investment strategy, I don\u2019t see a reason why funding should be provided, before the investment strategy has been locked in place, and properly reviewed by the Maker Community, similarly to how collateral is onboarded/D3Ms are launched today. Furthermore, this sentence in particular is a concern of mine:     Aes:  The pool might allocate to protocols that haven\u2019t passed a comprehensive risk and smart contract assessment by respective CUs   I believe this undermines the risk management processes that are in place today for what I would deem similar \u201cexternal investments\u201d for MakerDAO such as crypto collateral vaults and D3Ms. It sends the wrong signal that Maker is not adhering to its own established processes, while expecting third parties to do so. My recommendation would therefore be to go through the same due diligence processes that MakerDAO expects third parties to go through, when they wish to borrow Dai/inject Dai liquidity. The potential UniV3 LP strategies that are being highlighted as an example have already passed technical risk assessments through GUNI, so I don\u2019t see how it would slow down the group for that specific strategy. While the proposal does mention that respective Core Units will analyze the investments opportunities, let\u2019s be vigilant and formalize in the proposal itself that proper due diligence will be done. I think that would make a lot of the current nay sayers to this proposal a bit more comfortable. Secondly, this setup does not scale well. I think people need to ask themselves if they would feel comfortable with this setup if the amount was 100M Dai, or 1B Dai. Would our efforts be spent better figuring out a way such that fractions of the surplus buffer could automatically and safely be deployed into various strategies in a more trustless manner at scale? Finally, while the DSPauseProxy might be the owner of the multisig as per MIP47, it is my understanding of the setup that MakerDAO will never be able to react faster than members of the multisig unless there is a timelock in place, as it would require the implementation of an executive spell, that MKR holders would have to subsequently vote on for MakerDAO to overturn decisions by the group (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Thus I think MIP47 from a purely technical POV gives very weak veto options for MakerDAO, and only alleviates operational issues such as lost keys. It does not effectively mitigate trust assumptions. Therefore I would recommend having checks in place that allows MKR holders to more effectively veto decisions by the multisig group, or claim back funds. Yet this is not a perfect setup either, as that would require constant monitoring of the investment strategies by the community, which is one of the reasons why this setup does not scale well. Again, my hope is that my comments can help improve the robustness of the specific final implementation. I am not arguing for or against the ultimate goal of the proposal itself.

I hope this MIP passes because it would be beneficial to our buffer goals but agree that a CU, not sure which one, should pass a new MIP that would answer your security concerns.
