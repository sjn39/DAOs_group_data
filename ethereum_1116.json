Reducing the block reward will maintain the status quo of periodic community-activated block reward reductions. Abstract Of the top 4 Proof-of-Work blockchains, Ethereum pays the highest inflation rate for block validation.  Blockchains both larger, and smaller than Ethereum pay lower rates without any adverse effects.  Over-paying for block validators is an inefficiency that negatively affects all ETH holders, as it unnecessarily inflates the montary base and reduces the purchasing power of all Ether holders.   This EIP will reduce the block reward to bring inflation in-line with Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.   Block rewards will thus be adjusted to a base of 0.5ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly. Motivation A block reward that is too high is inefficient and negatively impacts the ecosystem economically. There is prior precedent for reducing the block reward; it has been done twice in the past in tandem with the diffusion of prior difficulty bombs.  The most recent diffusion, Muir Glacier, did not include a block reward reduction and thus broke the prior status-quo.  This EIP will revive the previous status-quo of periodical block reward reductions based on economic conditions.   With the upcoming release of ETH2.0 Phase 0 staking, inflationary pressures on Ethereum will be further increased.  Reducing the block reward prior to ETH2.0 Phase 0 staking will assist in alleviating negative inflationary effects. Specification Parameters in the source code that define the block reward will be adjusted accordingly. Rationale We determine the target block reward by first comparing the Bitcoin inflation rate: At the Bitcoin Halving there were 18,375,000 Bitcoins in circulation.   There are 328,500 new bitcoins mined each year (6.25 BTC/Day * 144 Blocks per day * 365 Days in a year).  The annual inflation rate for Bitcoin is is thus  1.78%. (328,500 / 18,375,000 * 100) At the time of writing, there were 110,875,500 Ether in circulation.  There are 4,982,250 Ether mined each year (13,650 ETH/Day * 365 Days in a year).  The annual inflation rate for Ethereum is thus 4.49%.  (4,982,250 / 110,875,500 * 100). (See https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward for the approximate daily Ether reward) The result of this comparison shows that Ethereum is currently paying a 2.52x higher block reward than Bitcoin. To further illustrate the point, if the ETH/BTC ratio increases to 0.041, all else equal, Ethereum will be paying a higher reward in $USD than bitcoin, despite being 3 times smaller in Market Capitalization. Sometime after November 2020, the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 chain will launch.  This chain will further add to the inflation rate of Ethereum, as it will generate staking rewards for all users that stake a deposit and validate blocks on the chain. The annual issuance from staking rewards is planned to be equal to 181 * SQRT(total ETH staked).  A chart below illustrates some possible values.     ETH validating Max annual issuance Max annual network inflation % Max annual reward rate (for validators)     1,000,000 181,019 0.17% 18.10%   3,000,000 313,534 0.30% 10.45%   10,000,000 572,433 0.54% 5.72%   30,000,000 991,483 0.94% 3.30%   100,000,000 1,810,193 1.71% 1.81%    It it highly unlikely that 100,000,000 ETH will stake on the beacon chain.  So we will use the lower number of 10M for our estimations. At this rate, the ETH inflation rate will increase to  5,554,683 ETH/yr. (4,982,250+572,433 =5,554,683). This yields an annual inflation rate of  ~ 5.00% (5,554,683/110,875,500 * 100). At this rate, Ethereum\u2019s inflation will be 2.81x (5.00/1.78) higher than bitcoin. In order to calculate the block subsidy required to achieve inflation parity with Bitcoin, we must first back out our estimations for ETH2.0 issuance in order to determine the maximum annual POW reward. 1,973,583.9 - 572,433 = 1,401,150.9 Max Annual PoW Rewards. Now, we calculate the max daily reward. 1,401,150.9 / 365 = 3839 Max Daily PoW Rewards. With a targeted block time of 13s, there are approximately 606024 / 13.1 = 6,646 blocks per day. 3839/6646 = 0.5776 ETH per block. According to Etherscan, uncle rewards are responsible for approximately 5% of the total daily reward emission. Therefore, the base block subsidy should be 0.5776 * 0.95 = 0.549. Thus, we arrive at a rate of 0.55 ETH base block reward to match Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate. We further note however, that the transaction fee market for Ethereum has risen sharply this year. As of August 11 2020, at the time of publishing this EIP, the fees from transactions make up almost 80% the current block rewards (2ETH). Thus, even if the block reward was set to zero, miners would still earn 1.8ETH from transaction fees per block.  Due to a robust and thriving fee market, we prepose to round to round down our block reward calculation from 0.55 to 0.5, which means (at the time of writing) miners would earn 1.8ETH in fees + 0.5ETH block reward, for a total of 2.3ETH per block. Backwards Compatibility All nodes must be upgraded to reflect the change in the block reward. Security Considerations Changing the block reward is purely an economic action, requiring only a change to the block reward parameter. Economically speaking, a block reward that is too low may result in low miner participation due to insufficient financial incentives.  This may result in a decrease of network security that may put PoW blockchains at risk of 51% re-org attacks. In this EIP we have laid out our economic evidence that reducing the block reward to 0.5 ETH would not negatively affect security by comparing it to other blockchains with larger market capitalizations.  Furthurmore, we note that Miners\u2019 expenses for housing and electricity are priced in FIAT terms (no electrical utilities in the in the world currently charge for Kilowatt-Hours in ETH). Therefore, miners make their mining decisions based on FIAT revenues they expect to earn. In $USD terms, miners would still be paid more than they were 3 months ago if this EIP were accepted (and still more than the 12 month average).  Thus, with this EIP, mining security economics are still better than they were 3 months ago when the price of ETH was half of what it is now, and the transaction fees were a fraction of their current value.

The biggest consideration, in my opinion, should be the security of the network (i.e. how do we ensure the likelihood of 51% attacks remains low, how do we keep a diverse set of miners on the network, etc.). I think a section describing this in details would help with your rationale.     jdetychey:  Block rewards will thus be adjusted to a base of 0.5ETH   My hunch is this is much too dramatic of a change, given we\u2019ve gone from 5 to 3 (-40%), then 3 to 2 (-33%), now you are going from 2 to 0.5 (-75%). What justifies increasing the rate at which block rewards get diminished vs. decreasing it (for example, to -25% which gives us 2 -> 1.5)? Again, I would personally like to see some security analysis that supports the numbers. ",

This is a pretty big shock to GPU miners who expected a slow roll down of block rewards over a multiple year period. I have been mining since the genesis block and this will be the third and largest overnight hit to block rewards we would have experienced since launch. It is correct, there is precedent for reducing the block reward, but it has never been 75% cut. GPU miners also just took a big hit with ProgPoW being blocked by other community groups, so I feel this EIP must be contextualized from a miners\u2019 perspective. I must admit, it feels really bad to be treated as a necessary evil to be paid out the minimum possible to incentivize us to keep our lights on just long enough to make the transition to 2.0 work. With that all being said, I really would like to understand why we are aiming to match the inflation rate of Bitcoin, which is much older than Ethereum, at a different stage in its development, and is trying to achieve different goals than Ethereum. It makes sense that Ethereum would have a higher inflation rate at this point in its history; it is 5 years younger than Bitcoin. I believe blockstream just made fun of Ethereum because we keep changing our inflation rate. Furthermore, this is feels like simply a shift of revenue from miners to protect the wealth already created by the system. The miners have grown, supported, and built businesses around this network for the past 5 years. Most mining companies barely made it through this crypto winter, and this EIP strips away the incentive we had for powering through stripped away at the first sign of recovery. We worked through the valley because we believed in the project, and we thought there were better days ahead. This EIP puts walls up around the Ethereum garden. We should still be at the phase where we are encouraging new users to participate in any fashion. The note on the block reward through transaction fees is already wrong by .5 Ether, just one short day after this was published. The current block reward is only comprised of 1.3 ETH worth of tx fees, so we can\u2019t assume transaction fees can consistently make up lost revenue from such a large reduction in inflation, and to make changes based on this assumption is reckless. I believe it makes far more sense to change PoW rewards (commensurate with past precedent) after PoS is live, as it makes sense to ensure the house we\u2019re moving into is sturdy before dismantling the old one.

Additionally, I would argue that the fact that fees are so high makes it more risky to push rewards down, because fee-dominant blockchains have security issues that block reward-dominant blockchains do not. This includes the sister-mining issues that have been warned about for years but also more subtle things; for example, miners would purchase hardware based on average fee levels, but there will be periods where fee levels are low, and during those periods there would be a lot of idle hardware, which could be rented out for attacks\u2026 Hence it seems better to lay off on more decreases for the moment and instead put our efforts toward EIP 1559, which alongside its many other benefits burns fees, reducing the security budget at times when it\u2019s needlessly high, and minimizes any known and unknown risks that arise from the blockchain becoming fee-dominant.

If EIP-1559 is achieved before this proposal, AND IF the fee-burning is of a non-trivial amount that will reduce inflation to below 0.5ETH,  then there will be no urgent need to activate this EIP.  We do not think this is likely to occur in the short or medium term. 1559 will not be activated on the next hard fork, so it is as least 6-12 months away.  Then after it is activated, 1559 requires end user wallets to update their fee handling.  Then, after both of those things, the fee burning needs to be large enough to reduce the inflation to a sufficient amount. We do not believe any of these things are likely to occur in the short or medium term, and therefore we would move forward with this EIP to reduce inflation and to reduce over-paying for security.  If EIP-1559 is achieved after this proposal, nothing would change from a technical perspective, there would simply be less deflation of the money supply by 1.5ETH per block on average.

This is a pretty big shock to GPU miners who expected a slow roll down of block rewards over a multiple year period. I have been mining since the genesis block and this will be the third and largest overnight hit to block rewards we would have experienced since launch. It is correct, there is precedent for reducing the block reward, but it has never been 75% cut. GPU miners also just took a big hit with ProgPoW being blocked by other community groups, so I feel this EIP must be contextualized from a miners\u2019 perspective. I must admit, it feels really bad to be treated as a necessary evil to be paid out the minimum possible to incentivize us to keep our lights on just long enough to make the transition to 2.0 work.   Your fiat earnings are not being cut.  Miners were mining 2ETH@$75 = $150 in December 2018.  Miners will be earning 0.5ETH@$350 = $175 if this change happened now. And they will be earning 0.5ETH@$490 = $245 if it returns to its August highs.     lmaonade80:  With that all being said, I really would like to understand why we are aiming to match the inflation rate of Bitcoin, which is much older than Ethereum, at a different stage in its development, and is trying to achieve different goals than Ethereum. It makes sense that Ethereum would have a higher inflation rate at this point in its history; it is 5 years younger than Bitcoin. I believe blockstream just made fun of Ethereum because we keep changing our inflation rate.   We are simply using Bitcoin, among other blockchains as evidence and reference that Ethereum is paying too much to block validators.  We don\u2019t make any other claims regarding the age or the blockchains or other features that one may have over another.     lmaonade80:  Furthermore, this is feels like simply a shift of revenue from miners to protect the wealth already created by the system. The miners have grown, supported, and built businesses around this network for the past 5 years. Most mining companies barely made it through this crypto winter, and this EIP strips away the incentive we had for powering through stripped away at the first sign of recovery. We worked through the valley because we believed in the project, and we thought there were better days ahead. This EIP puts walls up around the Ethereum garden. We should still be at the phase where we are encouraging new users to participate in any fashion.   Miners, in our view, are security-for-hire service providers.  There is no social contract, nor has there ever been, that miners should expect Ethereum block rewards to remain fixed indefinitely.  This has been the case since 2016 when the rewards were cut for the first time.  We fundamentally believe that economics of the larger ecosystem are more important than that of the miners.  Without a high price for ETH, miners would not be earning any money in the first place.  To suggest that miners economics must be first and foremost is like saying that \u201cthe tail should wag the dog\u201d.     lmaonade80:  The note on the block reward through transaction fees is already wrong by .5 Ether, just one short day after this was published. The current block reward is only comprised of 1.3 ETH worth of tx fees, so we can\u2019t assume transaction fees can consistently make up lost revenue from such a large reduction in inflation, and to make changes based on this assumption is reckless.   Good point. And just a few days ago, blocks has up to 11ETH in fees, with 2ETH in block rewards.  Even if the block reward was set to ZERO, miners would be very happy!  With all the continuing DeFi tx that we see occurring, we don\u2019t expect fees to drop any time soon.     lmaonade80:  I believe it makes far more sense to change PoW rewards (commensurate with past precedent) after PoS is live, as it makes sense to ensure the house we\u2019re moving into is sturdy before dismantling the old one.   We agree, and do not want to dismantle anything.  We want to make it more efficient. ",

If ASICs out compete GPUs at 0.5 eth per block they will out compete them at 2 ETH per block, and any other number too, it makes no difference. Given steady state ASICs will continue to be manufactured until it is no longer profitable to do so. The argument could be made this reduction is harmful to ASICs as the initial cost is very high, it may not be worth investing in them again after the dag size wipes out current miners as the pay off at 0.5 between now and phase 1.5 may not be worth it.   This analysis is correct. ",

Ah, 0 ETH block rewards + EIP-1559\u2026 sounds like someone is intentionally trying to destroy the network\u2026   What if the majority of miners won\u2019t support the switch to ETH2.0 PoS? Economics will always dictate what miners do.  The non-canon fork will not be called Ethereum, it will be called ETH Classic 2, or some other name.  Exchanges will continue to call the Core-dev-sanctioned chain \u201cEthereum\u201d.  It will have more value, since convincing everyone to switch to your new fork is hard.  This was tried with Ethereum Classic, and we can see the results there all to clearly. There is no precedent for miners to fork the chain on this issue. They did not do this on the previous two hard forks that reduced the block reward.   Also, ETH holders control $45B in wealth.  This includes exchanges and all the other market participants.  They will not side with miners. Instead, they would side with a chain that will have less inflation and  therefore less sell pressure, and therefore increase their wealth. In short, we are not concerned with this scenario.  Miners will happily mine on the 0.5ETH chain because the fiat rewards will be much higher than the forked chain.  So , by all means, fork the chain and mine on Ethereum Classic 2 if you so desire.  We encourage competition.  ETH holders would have tokens on both chains, so they would not take any net loss either. ",

                    "content": "Hey Vitalik! Thanks for chiming in.     vbuterin:  Seems needlessly risky for little gain, especially with PoS coming quite soon.   With all due respect, \u201ccoming quite soon\u201d seems to mean \u201cslightly better than the pace of a government IT department\u201d  Looking at Ethereum\u2019s original road map, its been almost 3 years since the first version of PoS was supposed to have been already launched.  If we had one wei for every time we heard \u201cquite soon\u201d, we would be rich enough to retire.   We believe, based on the pace that has been taken so far, it will be a number of years before the PoW chain is fully de-activated. In the meantime, if Ethereum continues to make progress, the price could go back to 2018 highs of $1,500, and miners would be earning exorbitant, inefficient, extortion-rate rewards.  This is not fair to ETH holders.     vbuterin:  the fact that fees are so high makes it more risky to push rewards down, because fee-dominant blockchains have security issues that block reward-dominant blockchains do not.   Last week, during the Uniswap token launch, we saw fees at 10-12 ETH per block.  That is 6 times higher than the reward of 2ETH.   In your calculations, what is the FEE/REWARD ratio that you feel would be \u2018unsafe\u2019?  Are you suggesting that If fees remain at 10ETH per block, should we instead be increasing the block reward?  If so, what should it be increased to?     vbuterin:  but also more subtle things; for example, miners would purchase hardware based on average fee levels, but there will be periods where fee levels are low, and during those periods there would be a lot of idle hardware, which could be rented out for attacks\u2026   Keep in mind that miners make their hardware purchasing decisions in FIAT terms, not ETH terms. This is because all their expenses must be paid in FIAT.  (hardware, electricity, real estate, labor, etc).  Idle hardware will occur any time a miner would be losing FIAT money by running their hardware.  This does not only happen in the scenario you describe.  This can, and does, happen in reward-dominant chains as well.  And it happens because the price of those tokens drop too low, which in turn reduces the FIAT rewards for the miners. Let\u2019s take your example for a moment.  No rational economic actor would suddenly buy 5x more mining hardware because of the short term fee spikes we have seen from DeFi apps.  They will only do so after a long-term period of high fees.   If the fees are high for a long-term period, that would mean that there is high demand for Ethereum transactions.  Presumably, many of those transactions would be through smart contract DApps similar to what we have seen over the past weeks (DeFi, lending, DEXs, etc).   If there is high demand for ETH transactions, all else equal, that would result in a higher demand for ETH itself, which would result in a higher price.  High fee/high demand periods also attract large amounts of stable-coins and other assets to be issued on Ethereum.  Those are sticky economic drivers that have a positive feedback loop effect that does not unwind very easily or quickly.  The higher price due to these actions would then make up for the low-fee periods.  Miners would still earn enough in FIAT to avoid idle hardware. In the disaster scenario you might argue for, where there is a protracted and long low-fee period and a large price drop in ETH, we could see idle hardware.    However, if this were to occur, we believe Ethereum would have bigger problems on its hands.   Such a scenario would likely mean that Ethereum did not innovate fast enough, and other competitors started capturing its market share. We could see this unfortunately happening if there are continued delays deploying level 1 scaling.  In the disaster scenario you might allude to, Ethereum would no longer be in demand, and miners will have nothing to mine because ETH will have little or no value.   We rely on you and the core devs to deploy ETH 2.0.   In the meantime, if we drop the block reward to efficient levels, there will be less inflation and supply, and that will (all else equal) lead to a higher price.   A higher price means that more capital, more investment, more liquidity, more talent, and more building happens on Ethereum.     vbuterin:  Hence it seems better to lay off on more decreases for the moment and instead put our efforts toward EIP 1559, which alongside its many other benefits  burns fees, reducing the security budget at times when it\u2019s needlessly high, and minimizes any known and unknown risks that arise from the blockchain becoming fee-dominant.   We fully support EIP-1559, and hope it will activate in the next hard fork. ",

Miners will be earning 0.5ETH@$350 = $175 if this change happened now. And they will be earning 0.5ETH@$490 = $245 if it returns to its August highs.   I hope you realize that December 2018 was the beginning of what we call \u201ccrypto winter\u201d where we mined and sold pretty much everything just to keep our lights on. Many mining ops were in debt, and many went bankrupt. I pay under 3 cents/kwh for power and we barely hung on. Reducing our fiat earnings back to this level will put the entire industry at risk again, but this time will be worse because there is no hope for better earnings in the future. See my next point, as your fiat earnings calc also ignores difficulty as a hindrance for earnings for miners.     JLilic:  We are simply using Bitcoin, among other blockchains as evidence and reference that Ethereum is paying too much to block validators. We don\u2019t make any other claims regarding the age or the blockchains or other features that one may have over another.   This is not a fair comparison due to another issue unaddressed by ETH that does not affect Bitcoin: ASIC\u2019s. There are no Bitcoin ASIC\u2019s that are far more profitable (to our knowledge) that makes the public BTC ASIC\u2019s weak by comparison. This is another uphill battle honest GPU miners must face today. We have no idea how much of the network is ASIC\u2019s, best guesses put it at 50%. While the upgrade with Bitcoin ASIC\u2019s v. Ethereum ASIC\u2019s are not as pronounced, it dramatically affects the bottom line for GPU miners, creates more centralization and security risk in the network. Solutions have been rejected by the (mostly non mining) community.     JLilic:  Miners, in our view, are security-for-hire service providers. There is no social contract, nor has there ever been, that miners should expect Ethereum block rewards to remain fixed indefinitely. This has been the case since 2016 when the rewards were cut for the first time. We fundamentally believe that economics of the larger ecosystem are more important than that of the miners. Without a high price for ETH, miners would not be earning any money in the first place. To suggest that miners economics must be first and foremost is like saying that \u201cthe tail should wag the dog\u201d.   I agree with your sentiment here, and miners know the community\u2019s feelings towards them all too well. But you are promulgating a change to an entire industry with an incomplete picture and drawing incorrect conclusions regarding the health of the Ethereum mining ecosystem. You are pricing out good actors and leaving only ASIC chips on the network. You cannot reduce inflation and leave ASIC\u2019s on the network. This is not good for Ethereum, is at odds with the yellowpaper, and creates security risks.     JLilic:  Good point. And just a few days ago, blocks has up to 11ETH in fees, with 2ETH in block rewards. Even if the block reward was set to ZERO, miners would be very happy! With all the continuing DeFi tx that we see occurring, we don\u2019t expect fees to drop any time soon.   Unfortunately, and you should know just as well as anyone, that layer2 solutions has the potential to all but erase any larger earnings miners have enjoyed recently as a result of DeFi. Telling miners they should be \u201chappy\u201d with an inconsistent revenue stream that could be erased through a myriad of other soon-to-be-deployed solutions feels very disingenuous to me.     JLilic:  We agree, and do not want to dismantle anything. We want to make it more efficient.   Then it sounds like you would agree we should have a discussion around lowering emissions, at the very least commensurate with emissions lowered in the past, as part of a discussion around removing ASIC\u2019s off the network AFTER Serenity is deployed. Not to mention EIP1559 + this proposal could eliminate mining rewards pretty much entirely for miners, and would leave mining to be approachable to a handful of chip makers with free hydro power in China.     JLilic:  In the disaster scenario you might argue for, where there is a protracted and long low-fee period and a large price drop in ETH, we could see idle hardware. However, if this were to occur, we believe Ethereum would have bigger problems on its hands. Such a scenario would likely mean that Ethereum did not innovate fast enough, and other competitors started capturing its market share.   You mean like the last 3 years? This is entirely possible, in fact, one would argue that crypto is cyclical, and will happen again.     JLilic:  We fully support EIP-1559, and hope it will activate in the next hard fork.   Then this EIP should be a non starter, as EIP 1559 addresses the concerns this EIP addresses more eloquently. While I am biased, and disagree with EIP 1559 in that it is radical and destroys some incentive for miners, it at the very least ensures that mining rewards are stable, and wouldn\u2019t force miners to rely on the latest DeFi meme to pay the power bills.

Your individual situation does not change the fact that the mining hashrate was still robust. Secondly, GPUs are faster and more efficient now, so there is some minor bias as to what the actual amount of work done is (which is more imporant than hash rate   First, my individual situation is better than most miners, especially in EU and NA. I know this because I now host for a lot of those miners that couldn\u2019t operate profitably anymore. There was mass capitulation in '18/'19. I built my situation to be super low cost so that I hope I am the last miner to go under. But I agree, my situation shouldn\u2019t be the takeaway here. Second, you are ignoring ASIC growth on the network, which can explain the hashrate. Third, like I said before and can also explain the hashrate, we (and I believe the industry at large) made ends meet because we believed in the project long term to deliver us mining rewards on par with the risk we took on. If revenue moves back down to those numbers because of change in the protocol, there is no reason to maintain our business as the light at the end of the tunnel was explicitly removed. Fourthly, while new hardware is better, it has not historically been worth the premium. A 3080 is rumored to hash up to 93 Mh/s at ~250 watts and costs $650+ (if you can find it). A 5700 can mine 51 Mh/s at ~125 watts and costs $400. By contrast, a 580 can hash 32 Mh/s at 90 watts and up until recently, could be found for $120. 580 = 0.36 mhash/watt @ $3.75/mhash 3080 = 0.372 mhash/watt (at best)  @ $6.5/mhash 5700 = 0.408 mhash/watt @ $7.69/mhash Almost every large scale miner (at least that I know) opted for the half as cheap hardware that that is only 12% less efficient as the ROI is faster, even when the hardware was older tech. I think ASIC\u2019s plays a larger role here than improved GPU tech.     JLilic:  Your fiat earnings are not being cut. Miners were mining 2ETH@$75 = $150 in December 2018. Miners will be earning 0.5ETH@$350 = $175 if this change happened now. And they will be earning 0.5ETH@$490 = $245 if it returns to its August highs.   Price is falling to $325 or so now. I think we both agree that the minimum security means ensuring honest mining co\u2019s stay in business, even if it means they\u2019re paid a lil bit more than they should during good times v. this proposal which makes this a somewhat profitable business when its good, and not worth it when its bad.

Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners don\u2019t HODL and cause immense selling pressure on Ethereum as they sell it for Bitcoin. This is primarily the reason why Ethereum has been unable to advance against Bitcoin the last two years even with major milestones being achieved. Put simply ASICs break our GPU business models of supporting Ethereum and HODLing as many coins as we can to support the network again through POS.
