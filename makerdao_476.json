Overview A user accidentally called the burn function on the DAI.sol on optimism, accidentally burning 10,000,000 DAI. Here is the transaction hash showing the event: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xd2a83ab5e9c412a5ce9e738e967051ebef9b92459a5732858a06cdf82ba469c8  The error occurred given that the burn function was confused with that of this contract: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xad32aa4bff8b61b4ae07e3ba437cf81100af0cd7 Given that it is easy to argue this was not intentional (nobody would send $10M USD to a 0 address), this post kindly requests to recover this funds via executive vote. Protocol Engineering has confirmed that it is possible to do this on-chain by pulling the funds manually from the Optimism escrow via an executive vote. The user can include a signed message with the wallet \u201cI called the burn function in the DAI contract out of confusion with a different contract, please help me recover the funds\u201d, if such proof is required. Hopefully the community will understand that this was a human error and help recover the funds.  Poll    Should there be an executive to manually pull the burnt 10 Million DAI from the Optimism escrow via an execution vote?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next steps This poll will close on January 7, 2022 ",

I sleep well not knowing who or what group is using the protocol to borrow DAI against collateral, because we aren\u2019t actively assisting anyone and it is part of the fact the protocol does not discriminate based upon race, ethnicity, sex, etc.   But here when we are asked to do an affirmative act for someone to retrieve an asset the value of which is $10 million, don\u2019t we have an obligation to know who is doing the asking and where they are from?   If someone on Interpol\u2019s red notice list buys a soda from a vending machine I own that is one thing, but if that same person knocks on my door and says help me retrieve $10 million I accidentally dropped in the storm sewer drain next to my house isn\u2019t that quite another and can\u2019t I get in trouble if I do so help that person?

Let me immediately qualify that by saying I do believe we should help recover the funds, but the way this poll is structured it seems to be a straight up recovery with no strings attached. As most are probably aware there is a proposal about instating a policy regarding recovering lost DAI. I believe we need to treat all users equally and fairly and thus I believe we need to instate such a policy first before we start recovering any funds. I am aware that forming such a policy is going to take some time but it seems to me to be a necessary first step before we commence a recovery operation. There are many who have lost DAI through user error in one form or another and others would, in my opinion, rightfully be angered if we select some to be recovered and not others. I ask for patience while we get a policy in place and promise I will do my part to help in the recovery once we have done so. ",

Because the Dai was burned on Optimism (as opposed to locked), it decreased the total supply on Optimism by 10,000,000. This means that we can transfer Dai on mainnet from the escrow to lost_some_dai\u2019s mainnet address while maintaining the above invariant. This is the simplest technical solution and is acceptable to lost_some_dai. The Escrow relies on the Governance Pause Proxy. This gives the Governance Pause Proxy permission to call approve in the Escrow. This week\u2019s spell will call approve, to approve the Governance Pause Proxy to transfer 10,000,000 dai from the escrow. It will then call transferFrom in the Dai contract on behalf of the escrow to transfer 10,000,000 to the user\u2019s address. This recovers the Dai and returns it to the user while keeping the technical aspects straightforward and abiding by the Bridge balance invariant. Link to the Optimism Bridge code repo Since we are recovering the funds on mainnet, the only two contracts that matter for our plan are the mainnet Dai and the mainnet Escrow. The Escrow holds the Dai balance on mainnet when Dai is transferred to Optimism. ",
