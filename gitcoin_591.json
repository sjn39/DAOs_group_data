In addition to the seven main awardees, a list of honorable mentions was also published.   The first workstream payments are going out to the squad helping push forward the climate change, advocacy, and longevity rounds for GR12 this week!   Onboarding continues to make progress with help from @krrisis and others across the DAO, funded in part by PGF.   The public goods library continues to grow, and Henry Zhu recently put forward a deep, thoughtful talk on Ivan Illich\u2019s work, helping the DAO further its understanding of the commons we all seek to serve.     Moonshot Collective    A Budget Request Proposal for the Moonshot Collective - Q4 2021 was posted in the forum by @austingriffith requesting to fund the Moonshot Collective with 100k GTC for the next 3 months. @owocki provided the Season 1 build roadmap for the Moonshot Collective in the comments section.   Every Friday the Moonshot Collective gets together to show off their progress. This week includes Moonswap, Quadratic Diplomacy, Tip.Party, and Merch. Learn more by saying hello in Discord, or checking out our Website. Demo videos for each project can be found on YouTube. Follow @MoonshotCollect on Twitter for frequent updates. Every month, MC presents a demo for their GitcoinDAO projects. Each project gets 5 minutes to show off what they\u2019ve built! Last week Decentralized Grants, Mars Shot Bots, Open signal, Scaffold Directory, GitcoinDAO Steward Report Cards, Anon Vs Moloch, Wayfair Discord Bot, Tip.Party, and Quadratic Diplomacy demoed during the monthly call.     Decentralize Gitcoin    The team is running a Decentralized Grant Round on the Polygon network for the Moonshot Collective Workstream as a way to support our DAO, stress test the system, and collect feedback from users.   The Workstream has collected valuable feedback from many MC team members as a number of bug fixes have been pushed out.   The MC team has created 6 grants so far. The round is planned to kick off externally on October 18th, scope and requirements are being defined\u2026     Fraud Detection & Defense    A Proposal to ratify the results of Grants Round 11 and formally request the community multisig to pay out matching allocations is live on Snapshot until October 17th.   FDD is sending out DAO contributor agreements to all participants. The Workstream is recommending all DAO contributors use an LLC. Payments are beginning to stream to contributors!   The State of FDD blog post & Q4 Budget Proposal will be published this week.   BlockScience shared their report on the GR11 Anti-Sybil efforts. Fraud tax was down over 50%. First round we had enough human evaluators to perform statistical analysis. There were 853 Sybil accounts sanctioned. For GR12, a community ML algo is to run side by side with the BlockScience algo and on-chain forensic detection methods will be added.   FDD met with Celeste to build a decentralized appeals process.   Four contributors from Gitcoin will participate in the Gnosis + Governauts DAO compensation research project.   Planning started for the ambassador program and FDD is currently supporting Cross-stream DAOops until it potentially becomes a Workstream.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    The vote to ratify the MMM Workstream budget request for Q4 2021 has passed and action has been taken to push forward on a formal on-chain vote.   This newsletter you are reading right now is part of the MMM-copywriting substream. Each GitcoinDAO Workstream is responsible for their respective section, but the newsletter as a whole is funded and maintained by MMM. Beside the newsletter, the copywriting-substream is maintaining the @GitcoinDAO-Twitter account and is working on improving the GitcoinDAO-onboarding process.   A \u201cRegen vs Degen\u201d-card game is being developed as a novel educational effort to explain technical terms and expressions. The game is currently being playtested to get it balanced and make it as fun as possible. Once feedback from the playtesters and artwork for the cards are implemented and complete, an online tournament will be held to celebrate the launch. An option to buy the physical cards will also exist.     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in Discord!

Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!   Meta-Governance    The proposal to ratify the results of GR11 has been ratified on Snapshot, the majority vote going towards allowing to pay all grants the amount of match funds from the community multisig as determined by applying QF after removing contributions attributed to accounts flagged as sybil.   @Huxwell gave an update on the Discovery-workstream proposal after two weeks of discussion on the forum. \u201cWe\u2019d like to move forward by creating a vote on Snapshot in the following days that will contain an updated and simplified version for the proposal and budget request\u201d. The updated proposal Integrate dCompass within dGitcoin to build dQuests & dKnowledge. The name of the workstream has been renamed from Discovery to dCompass.   The Community Experience team spearheaded by @krrisis is making great progress on streamlining cross-DAO operations, onboarding flows, a Notion and Discord rework, and more. In this context \u201cGitcoin\u2019s orbit\u201d by Kevin Owocki explores the Gitcoin ecosystem and onboarding by drawing parallels to a solar system. The post also describes what a \u201cDAO of DAOs\u201d-solar system might look like.   Renee Lee started a discussion in the How we achieve our mission-thread on \u201cwhich role(s) the GitcoinDAO Ambassador may play within quadratic diplomacy and coordinating culture + capital\u201d.   @kelsien raised questions and concerns regarding the Steward Report Cards and the metrics displayed on the cards.

Decentralize Gitcoin    The POC instance of dGrants, which is acting as our current production environment, now has 11 grants created by the Moonshot Collective team.   Test data has been cleaned up and the round has been updated in preparation for the marketing push on Oct 20th at 3PM EST.   A number of bugs have been fixed and a significant number of changes have been made based on feedback that we have received from internal testing.   The budget proposal for Q4 2021 is coming soon along with the dCompass teams proposal for budget within the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Proposal to ratify the results of Grants Round 11 passed. Payouts start streaming on 10/21/21. @DisruptionJoe authored a Twitter thread on the topic of fraud tax and why it will not be paid out this round.   Open sourced DAO contributor agreements are being sent to all contributors.   Contributor payments for Epochs 1-3 were sent out by FDD and Epochs 4-6 will be sent next week. Q4 payments will stream weekly or biweekly.   The FDD-Budget Proposal for Q4 is about to be released. 90,000 GTC which includes one quarter of reserves for the defense streams are being requested. The State of FDD companion piece provides further details about the current role of the Workstream, which includes a Roadmap to Progressive Decentralization, how FDD provides value to GitcoinDAO, and a breakdown of all FDD initiatives.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    MMM created POAPs for the Public Goods Workstream and the Moonshot Collective. To date, MMM has created and gifted POAPs to more than 50 people for GitcoinDAO related events and roles.   MMM is making a steady stream of memes for the Moonshot Collective Twitter to celebrate their builds, culture and community and continuing a valiant effort to meme public goods into existence and spread the vision of Gitcoin.
