The licensing of patented technology is inevitable if MakerDAO wants to rapidly grow and expand. Licensing can turn a liability into an asset, and those that procure licensure early on have an inherent advantage. As I understand MakerDAO operations, USDC transfers, Governance Voting  Token Swaps, Borrowing DAI, and Multiplying Collateral currently infringe this patents claims. Anxious to imbibe upon constructive feedback. ",

His evasive and incredible answers to questions on cross-examination and his conduct resulting in the SEC consent order (Dkt. 29 at 866) convince the court that Middleton is willing to misrepresent the facts and render his testimony unworthy of belief.\u201d \"Middleton raised millions of dollars by issuing tokens but did so as unregistered securities and coupled with his misappropriation of the patents, his actions have rendered the Company worthless. \" ",
