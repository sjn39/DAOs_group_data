I have seen an account get a 4 day ban for abusing the flagging system on here already. That being said it\u2019s not really something I would label as one of upmost importance as someone can make as many fake accounts as they wish they\u2019re not the ones voting unless they are holding uni. Also to note the admins can see who is flagging and abusing flagging. When a post is flagged once it is hidden it can be edited and is automatically unflagged after which if its flagged again it has to be reviewed by an admin before being unflagged. That being said if a post isnt unflagged it probably means it is more than likely going against Governance Rules and was deemed to be flagged correctly. I think shaming people and making people scared to use the flag button in fear of using it wrong and being seen to be \u201cabusing the flag button\u201d is wrong here ",

Yes I would agree there has been a very large influx of new accounts which I have notice myself aswell but I\u2019m trying to give the benefit of the doubt that these are really new people interested in Unisap governance and not a single person making multiple account to try to manipulate/abuse the system and or peoples thoughts/views ",

I think personally admins laying out clearer governance rules could help in a way regarding what should and shouldn\u2019t be put on the forums, although I am aware they do already have rules out but i fear not many people are reading them. I also think a lot of moderator time is being wasted cleaning out multiple posts of the same topic if people on here start to help moderators by not creating multiple threads on the same topic unless the topic is vastly different then moderators might be able to spend more time moderating and less time going around closing/locking repeat posts and redirecting people to the correct posts. Either way admins are looking at posts I agree though less false flagging would mean falsely flagged posts would get unflagged faster but again if it\u2019s been flagged twice then admins are notified and for first flags a simple edit lifts the flag anyway ",
