                    "content": " MIP63: Maker Keeper Network  Preamble MIP#: 63 Title: Maker Keeper Network Author(s): Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut) Contributors: None Type: Technical Tags: technical, process, liquidations Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2021-12-08 Date Ratified: 2022-01-24 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a License: AGPL3+ Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQqFpjv?network=mainnet#poll-detail   References  The proposed code    Sentence Summary Maker Keeper Network is a unified repository to coordinate between multiple third-party Keeper Networks.  Paragraph Summary The Maker Keeper Network interfaces with third-party keeper protocols to maintain Maker. This includes but is not limited to things such as poking oracles, liquidating vaults, managing the autoline, managing D3Ms, etc.  Component Summary MIP63c1: Sequencer Summary of Sequencer contract MIP63c2: IJob Summary of IJob implementing contract(s) MIP63c3: Risk considerations Comments on risk implications of adding Maker Keeper Network MIP63c4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network Process component for applying for an operating budget from the surplus buffer MIP63c5: Keeper Network List Currently active Keeper Networks MIP63c6: Offboard Keeper Network Process component for closing out a Keeper Network  Motivation As Maker continues to scale we need to add more redundancies in place for maintaining the system. Certain systems such as oracles and liquidations are mission critical. If a failure occurs in one of these systems, it could cause the end of DAI. This proposal seeks to unify the keeper interface and distribute the workload across many third-party networks.  Specification  MIP63c1: Sequencer The primary contract for coordinating who is allowed to call keeper functions. Keepers require coordination to prevent too many actors from fighting for the same action. Without coordination, you have failed transactions and wasted gas. Keeper implementations must respect the Sequencer and wait for their turn. Failure to respect the Sequencer can lead to ejection from the keeper ecosystem.  MIP63c2: IJob Maker can add new jobs as an IJob contract. These should supply the getNextJob(network) function, which can perform potentially gas intensive operations to determine if a keeper action is available. It is the Keeper Network\u2019s job to call this every block and see if a new action is available.  MIP63c3: Risk considerations All keeper operations on Maker are permissionless, so there is no risk to the system other than potentially losing the budget. This module sits outside of the core modules. The only connection is through dss-vest, where Keeper Networks are allocated a budget.  MIP63c4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network  Keeper Duties and Expectations It is expected that Keeper Networks will be able to appropriate stream in their budget to be within the requested buffer min and max values. Any excess DAI beyond the max should be returned to the surplus buffer, and the network should act in a timely manor to replenish DAI if the buffer drops below the min value. If the DAI in the buffer consistently is dropping below the min value then a new application should be submitted to increase the budget. Keeper Networks are expected to be able to utilize the DAI to pay for gas. Maker will not be streaming ETH or other gas tokens. Keeper Networks should have a mechanism for receiving one-time payments. This can be used in emergency situations to top up the buffer without having to go through an executive vote. Keeper Networks are expected to track all active IJob contracts, and execute any of them if they return a successful response (budget permitting). Consistent failure to execute an available action when it is your turn may result in an Offboarding application. Keeper Networks are expected to \u201cplay nice\u201d. There is no smart contract enforcement of taking turns, and declaring yourself as a certain network. Instead this is enforced by off-chain monitoring and potentially revoking budgets. This \u201cplay nice\u201d strategy is necessary to save a lot of gas and reduce complexity. This subproposal process allows keeper networks to apply for an operating budget from the Surplus Buffer. The parameters for MIP63c4 subproposals are:   Feedback Period: 3 weeks  Frozen Period: 1 week  Outcome: Keeper network is either onboarded successfully or is rejected. If onboarded, a budget is streamed out of dss-vest at the next available opportunity. Network is also inserted to the Sequencer via addNetwork(...). MIP63c4 subproposals must use the MIP63c4-Subproposal-Template template.  MIP63c5: Keeper Network List This listing is to be maintained and updated by the Governance Facilitators. It will serve as an active registry of approved Keeper Networks. Entries into this list should contain the following information:  Network Name: The name of the Keeper Network  Short Name: All-caps machine name of the network Budget: DAI / day. Buffer Min: In DAI Buffer Max: In DAI Address: Address which dss-vest streams DAI to. Date Added: (yyyy-mm-dd)    Keeper Network List  MIP63c6: Offboard Keeper Network Any community member can begin an offboarding process. Reasons for termination include, but are not limited to:  Network is operating out of order. The network is continually operating out of order with respect to the Sequencer. Network is missing too many keeper actions when it should be executing. Network is not maintaining its budget limits. They frequently go outside of the min/max limit when this is able to be prevented (by streaming more DAI for example).  The parameters for MIP63c5 subproposals are:   Feedback Period: 3 weeks  Frozen Period: 1 week  Outcome: Keeper network is either offboarded successfully or they continue as-is. If offboarded, the budget will be terminated from dss-vest at the next available opportunity. MIP63c5 subproposals must use the MIP63c5-Subproposal-Template template. ",
