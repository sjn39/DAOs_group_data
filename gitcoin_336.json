This process is intended to be used sparingly and is not designed to be an alternative litigation process for dissatisfied users of the governance process. Abstract: This mechanism is designed as a stop-gap measure in cases where there is a material change in information around a vote that could have changed the outcome of a vote had that information been known prior to the vote being cast. A suitable example of a case to reconsider a vote would be if there is new information that, if known prior to the vote, might have changed the outcome of the vote. To note, this process is designed for situations where any new material information is brought to light, or there is a significant environmental change. In the case of new information being brought to light, it does not pass judgment on if the new information was asymmetrically unavailable (information was withheld, obfuscated, or omitted) or if new information was previously unknown and has recently been discovered. Motivation: The web3 space changes rapidly and good governance processes protect against the implementation of bad choices, but it also needs to be flexible enough to rapidly adjust as new information as it is made available. Without a controlled process in place, the DAO is at risk for being forced to implement outdated decisions, move in an uncoordinated fashion, or make inappropriate or unauthorized declarations in order to repeal decisions in a way that might cause the entire governance process to be called into question. Specifications: This outlines the order of operations that the DAO might expect to encounter. This process is designed to be light enough to flex with changing circumstances, yet give enough direction to guide a just process in relation to decision makers and decision flow. A typical case:   The case at issue is related to a vote which has recently closed   New or previously unknown information is made public in relation to the vote, or there has been a significant change in the environment (ex: drastic change in BTC/GTC price)   A call to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d is raised by a current CSDO member to the Steward Council    The call to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d must be brought by a CSDO member who 1) cast a vote in the election in question AND 2) whose vote was aligned with the outcome of the election.    Example 1: if the vote failed, a member of CSDO who specifically voted against the proposal must raise the question to the Steward Council Example 2: If the vote passed, a member of CSDO who specifically voted for the proposal must raise the question to the Steward Council     Ideally, the situation is discussed in the next CSDO meeting, but this is not required.   The subject is added to the next Steward Council meeting for discussion and decision.   The Steward Council support team will invite the appropriate parties to the meeting.   After discussing the issue, there can be one of two outcomes from the Steward Council:     A. If the Steward Council votes in the affirmative to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d, then the Steward Council makes the decision known and the original vote is null and void. The proposal can be brought back for a revote by the original proposer following the standard governance process. The proposal may be the same or amended as per the preferences of the proposer. If the proposal is not brought by the original proposer within 7 days, the original vote is considered null and void.   B. If the Steward Council does not motion to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d, or if a motion to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d fails a majority vote, the original vote stands and must be executed as originally passed.   Benefits:   This proposal allows for the coordinated reconsideration of proposal   This process establishes a higher bar for reconsideration as to avoid the relitigation by the disaffected voters of the proposal.   This process protects the DAO from activist voters who attempt to use the governance process as a method to circumvent the educated will of the voters.   This process is not novel. It is a reapplication of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order NR which has been robustly tested in parliamentary procedure.   Drawbacks: Core to the governance process is belief the process is just and efficient. Continuous reconsidering of proposals opens the process for misuse, abuse and can erode confidence in the governance process. These cases should be carefully considered before raising a motion to reconsider:   This process should only be used when new information is made public, or there is a significant environmental change.   The process should not be used to relitigate righteous votes   Vote: YES: Implement the reconsideration process as outlined NO: Do not implement the reconsideration process as outlined ",

One suggestion: CSDO doesn\u2019t have any legitimacy in this context. The steward council would serve as a better appellate court because their legitimacy comes from the token holders.   I agree there are two options here for this review, CSDO and the Steward Council and both have advantages and disadvantages.  Lets hit the highlights: CSDO has greater history, it has better internal context, and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  However, it is not an elected body, it is comprised of Gitcoin insiders, and the CSDO charters states that its decision space includes \u201cDAO-wide governing agreements (except what\u2019s passed to Snapshot vote)\u201d.  (link) The Steward Council includes independent external-to-Gitcoin members, it is an elected + appointed body, it include executive thinkers from outside Gitcoin, and it includes some of the highest context members internal to Gitcoin.  However, the Steward Council is a new experiment, the effectiveness of the body has not yet to be proven, and it was setup up as an advisory body without decision rights.  (link) As a governance thinker, I am ok with either body acting as a stop-gap measure knowing it is the voters who will decide the ultimate outcome.  Over time, if the Steward Council experiment proves resilient, moving this kind of case to the that body would seem like a normal maturation.    [S17 Proposal] INTEGRATED FDD Budget Request   Our governance says that a snapshot vote is final. If you look at Uniswap, 100% of their snapshot votes are enacted on Tally. Do we want to be the ones to change this precedent for the ecosystem based on a few posts on the forum rather than a legitimate process? How do we remain leaders in legitimacy after that?   We would not be the first DAO to enact a stopgap measure between on and off chain voting.  Maker for example has a \u201ccooling off period\u201d post-vote in which time a stop to a vote could be triggered by a whale or collection of whales. Their process requires the  burning of MKR and to my knowledge has never been used, but it exists. This being said, legitimacy is derived from 1) having a defined process 2) following that process dispassionately and 3) changing / ratifying a process when the need presents itself.  This proposal attempts to do just that. ",

                    "content": "Thanks, Shawn for proposing this. It does feel like the highest context body (CSDO) are likely the most informed when it comes to budgetary matters for workstreams. However, if a general GCP was put to vote and then contested, I am less sure CSDO is the right body to contest. Here are a few examples: 1 - Workstream Z works in conjunction with other workstreams to propose a budget. Information materially changes, or new information is surfaced (a key person leaves the workstream, the use of funds in previous season was inaccurately reported, etc.), CSDO will likely be the body that best understands the impact and can request workstream Z reconsider. 2 - A GCP to fund a partnership with another team/DAO passes. Information materially changes or new info is presented. In this case, CSDO is directly impacted by the proposal as it outside the workstreams. Although a CSDO member may have been involved in the original proposal, it should not be a proposal that directly impacts their work. As a result, the Steward Council may have as much context as CSDO and could serve as an appellate board. I wonder if we want to spell out this type of nuance in the \u201creconsider\u201d steps of our governance? ",

Thanks @jengajojo for the comment and reminders.  A solid process is case independent and it is good practice to segregate an incident from governance design, but to confirm that the invented process will work for that case, as well as others.  I do agree that an internal body left to itself to make a final decision would be a centralization step too far.  Recall that in this proposed solution, we are looking for the Gitcoin Stewards (voters) to make a final choice.     jengajojo:  specialist dispute resolution body like Ombuds or an external group such as Kleros   I did look at Klerios as a solution and even purchased 5000 PNK to participate in the courts, but I did not see sufficient evidence that their process would be appropriate for our volume.  Should the volume of \u201creconsiderations\u201d at Gitcoin increase to a meaningful level, we may have to look at other solutions, but given Governance has a habit of unchecked expansion, I strive to keep processes as light as possible. However, if there is sufficient support for an alternate path from Stewards, I open to investigating further. ",

However given the Steward Council is in its first elected season and the efficacy of the council has not been proven (vs. the cost), it may be premature to assign this to the Steward Council.  If the council is not renewed in three months due to a poor ROI, we would have a gap. To your point, we could design a process that could steer decisions to one body vs. another depending on the type, but I might suggest we take that step if the volume \u201creconsiderations\u201d proves problematic. Regardless, this is what I would describe as a \u201chappy problem\u201d.  Gitcoin has two possible options for this kind of process where many orgs would scramble to come up with one legitimate body.  And in either case, if the decision is made to reconsider a vote, the token holders own the ultimate decision. But, as there are opinions on this on both sides, there are pros & cons for both sides, let\u2019s do the democratic thing and get a sense from those following this discussion.    Which body should decide if Gitcoin holds a \u201creconsider\u201d vote  The CSDO team should be the body to \u201creconsider\u201d The Steward Council should be the body to \u201creconsider\u201d Neither should be the body to \u201creconsider\u201d     0 voters     ",

Hey @Yalor I really like the rage quit concept, especially from a co-founder and early start up perspective.  This kind of a mechanism incentivizes major token-holder collaboration (in order not to diminish the treasury) but allows for a planned exit when common ground cannot be found. For Gitcoin Stewards, it might have less applicability given many of our stewards hold more delegated tokens vs owned tokens.   And rage quitting for Gitcoin stewards or contributors means they might have rage, they might quit, but the cost to the DAO is social/reputational vs. having a treasury impact.   For anyone interested in the rage quit concept, here is a quick article.     Yalor:  For example, I would love to be able to revoke my tokens for a certain initiative if I felt the leader of that initiative was no longer capable or qualified to execute on it.   You nailed it.  One of the gaps in our budgeting process is that we have only binary votes and signaling is only up/down.  If you compare FDD and DAOops S16 vs. S17 vote performance, there is little correlating voting data suggesting a workstream is in jeopardy - indicators are all social. @krrisis Umar and I are working on an updated budgeting process should allow for better signaling.     Yalor:  I think the Stewards should probably be the ones to review the case and make the final decision, sort of like DAO jury duty  let the people who are not closest to the situation hear the facts and then make a decision.   Consensus is building around this direction and is consistent with what the Steward Council told us yesterday.  Thanks for the affirmation and engagement @Yalor, it really helps. ",

You can view the live stream of that meeting here The major adjustment with the proposal is that CSDO initiates the motion to reconsider, and the subject is then taken up by the Steward Council for decision.  This adjustment allows an internal body with maximum context (CSDO) to raise and issue, but then refers the decision an elected/appointed body for decision (Steward Council). Thanks @ebransom for this concept - it is an elegant solution that leverages the strengths of both bodies.

How does the Steward council vote\u2026 is it a majority vote? is it that a member of that council presents the option to revote and a second member affirms the need for a revote, etc. Would love to vote on this proposal but dont feel I have enough details to support yet.

According to the text in the proposal, the steward council votes for a \u201creconsideration\u201d or against a reconsideration using a simple majority vote.  The reconsider motion is brought to the steward council via a CSDO member which meets the criteria. The reference was obscure in the proposal, so thanks for asking the question and raising this up. From the proposal:     shawn16400:  B. If the Steward Council does not motion to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d, or if a motion to \u201creconsider the vote\u201d fails a majority vote, the original vote stands and must be executed as originally passed.   Also, as I mentioned briefly in our quick discussion, we did not define a quorum for a decision takens by the Stewards Council.  Said another way, what minimum number of Steward Council members should be in attendance before a vote can be called?  Typically, a quorum is anywhere from a 51% (most common) to 66% (less common) of a voting body, as defined by that body.  To avoid this turning into an issue in the future, I will add that topic for our next steward council election. ",

In the motivation section you mention:  Without a controlled process in place, the DAO is at risk for being forced to implement outdated decisions, move in an uncoordinated fashion, or make inappropriate or unauthorized declarations in order to repeal decisions in a way that might cause the entire governance process to be called into question.  But can you perhaps give a more contrete example than in the specifications? Why should any member of the CSDO have the power to ask for a vote recondisderation? I can see this being open to abuse and for creating impermanence in the way governance works. ",

Hey @CoachJonathan thanks for the question - and yes, you are correct.  After a motion to reconsider has passed, the original vote is essentially dead and the 7 day deadline is a bit redundant.  The intent of the 7 day timeline was to prompt the original proposer to move with haste to get the issue to resolution, or to accept the issue dead.  When we get to a point of writing a constitution (summation of governance processes) we could simplify the proposal and clean that up a bit.  ",
