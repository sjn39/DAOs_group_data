We had a joyous conversation along with a special tasting of Zignum Anejo Mezcal, and homemade Kra\u00fcteropa Licorice. We really enjoyed discussing and understanding the Centrifuge Protocol, and hope that you do as well. Join @PaperImperium @rspa @Khan and I as we drill down on the future of Real-World Assets.
