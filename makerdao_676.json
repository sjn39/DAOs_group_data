We had this feeling during the last sprint, watching our keeper take some auctions on goerli and kovan for the first time. Today we are releasing the first version of our collateral keeper. Besides that, we made some good progress to support the Dai bidding flow in our UI. Our plan is to release this feature at the end of the next sprint. And lastly, not having any information on a finished auction was a thorn in our side. We changed it\u2026 Phillips Auction House is considered as a very dynamic and forward-looking auction house, due to its focus on the defining aesthetic movements of the last century. With especially an eye on the next sprint, we also work future-oriented and want to constantly release new features and work out the foundation for upcoming ones, so the name Phillips seems like a fit.  A closer look at changes  Unified Auctions Keeper implementation V1  Keeper_logs1918\u00d7258 41.1 KB  For the first version of our keeper implementation, we were able to rely on a lot of the logic that we have already built for our UI. Our modular and structured approach right from the beginning pays off. With the keeper, we are basically providing a script that fetches collateral auctions and its market values on a regular basis. Once one auction becomes profitable, the script executes the relevant authorizations (if they are not yet executed) and moves on to take the auction via flash landing. The keeper is not optimized in a way to outcompete other market actors, but rather constitutes a backstop solution. Everyone is able to download and run the code themselves after setting the required parameters (more on that in the readme) Despite it\u2019s the first release of the keeper, a lot of thought was put in its design already:  Our keeper implementation is beginner-friendly (you need to create one config file with only a few parameters to get it running) The keeper can work in a simulated environment such as a hardhat fork without a problem (since we fetch current maker contracts from the chainlog contract) The keeper wouldn\u2019t execute any transactions (including auth transactions) until it can yield a net profit specified by the user. Net profit means that it takes estimated transaction fees into consideration The keeper executes auctions in parallel, meaning that if there are several auctions running, it will not wait for one transaction to finish executing another one. At the same time, the design prevents it from executing authorisations of the same kind twice, even if they are running in parallel  We\u2019re looking forward to your feedback and feature requests for the next Unified Auctions Keeper versions.  Info on finished auctions  Finished_Auction1368\u00d7360 28.3 KB  When directly navigating to a past auction on the Unified Auctions UI in the past, we only showed the message \u201cThis auction was not found\u201d. We don\u2019t want to keep the user in the dark any longer and now provide some information on what happened to the auction in question. For that, fetch clipper Take events and display the transaction hashes for further investigation. You can try it out with a recent ETH-A auction: Auctions UI As always, we are aiming to provide the best possible experience to the user, and we see past auction data as a means to make more informed decisions. So in the future we will bring more analytical auction data to the UI.  Progress on the Dai bidding flow  WalletPopup624\u00d7904 83 KB  In our last release notes, we already gave an insight on how we are going to support the flow to bid on an auction with Dai. The first components and some underlying logic was built. The missing part to complete this feature is to provide an interface to the user that allows to deposit and withdraw Dai to and from the VAT. This is what we are tackling in the next sprint. ",

For that, we re-structured our code base in a way that makes it easier to support new callee contracts. Other than that, we introduced minor UX improvements and further automated our CD pipelines. Since we are working on the streamlined integration of new collaterals, this time the update bears the name of one of the most internationally important auction houses.  A closer look at changes and new features  Streamlining the collateral onboarding process, part 2. It is our goal to ensure the lowest possible ETA for our UIs and future keepers to support new collateral types while not sacrificing any code quality. A crucial part of this onboarding process is to utilize new exchange-callee contracts without friction. This is why we re-structured our code base and split all logic related to callees and Uniswap in two different files. Now every callee is required (enforced by the type) to have two functions: one for calculating the price of the collateral, the other is for producing the parameters for the transaction. Together with the removal of dai.js related issues in the last sprint, this second building block allows us to further streamline the onboarding process of new collateral types when it comes to UI support.  UX improvements  Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 09.30.341366\u00d7414 35.8 KB  For a user observing an auction, it\u2019s not only helpful to see its real-time metrics, but also have an indicator of when the auction turns profitable for a flash loan-based execution. That is why we added the Estimated Profitability Time indicator to our auction table to further improve UX for auction participants. In addition to that, we realized that a user is currently left in the dark when it comes to small numbers, since we only showed two decimal places. We never want to leave users in the dark, and hence fixed our number formatting to dynamically adjust for small and large numbers.  Devops In this sprint, we worked more on our automatic deployment story: We\u2019ve prepared a new production environment that is automatically deployed on a Git Tag event in addition to the staging environment that already exists and deploys on every merge to main. We already prepared the new production environment to listen to unified-auctions.makerdao.com once this forum post goes through, and we get the domain. ",

Our last sprint we focused on doing planning and conceptual work to pave the way for features to come, rather than shipping new features. So besides an overhaul of our T&C statement and consent flow, we put work into conceptualizing the feature to bid with Dai on collateral auctions. Additionally, we further pushed our keeper implementation and plan to release its first version in the next sprint. Since we focused on preparing for upcoming features in this sprint, this time the update is called Heritage Auctions. Besides the appropriate name, this auction house is also known for its collection of rare coins.  A closer look at changes and things to come  Conceptual work: Dai bidding  Mock1366\u00d7894 152 KB  During the market crash in January, we learned that there is still demand for the use case to participate in auctions with own Dai funds. The Unified Auctions UI currently supports flashloan based auction participation but does not yet enable users to bid on an auction with their own DAI. Hence, based on our quest to cater for all the auction related users needs, we want to cover this use case as well. With this step, we\u2019ll also cover all the features the Liquidation Portal offers. We used the last sprint to properly conceptualize the integration of the new feature into the existing UI and simplify the flow as much as possible. Our goal is to let the user decide for each auction whether to swap into profit or bid with the own Dai. You can find a link to the Mock on how we want to bring this feature to live in the coming sprints here. Feedback is more than welcome!  Terms and condition updates  ConsentPopup1040\u00d7472 43.8 KB  To ensure legally sound services, we collaborated with experts in the field and came up with a new version of our terms and conditions (T&C). The consent flow for the user is based on a session cookie. This gives us the possibility to make updates to the T&C when needed while still providing frictionless UX.  WIP: Keeper implementation In the next sprint, we plan to release the first version of our own collateral auction keeper implementation. The basic idea behind this implementation is to provide a keeper algorithm that relies on the logic that we have already implemented for our UI. We want to enable users to run their own keeper by downloading and running the code themselves. They\u2019ll only need to provide basic parameters like minimum profit, wallet private key and the infura key. The keeper will take auth costs into account, support the same collaterals that are supported by the UI and will use the latest maker protocol contract addresses from the chainlink. ",
