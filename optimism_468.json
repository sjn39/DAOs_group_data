Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: As soon as the proposal will be approved Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Despite being one of the very largest L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem, Optimism has a relatively small community in Ukraine. We have already taken steps to start building a strong community of Optimists here in Ukraine, for example featuring Optimism as a community partner at Kyiv Tech Summit where Vee kindly appeared on the \u201cPeace as a public good\u201d panel. We have directly introduced The Ministry of Digital Transformation to some core contributors @  OP Labs/Foundation to facilitate Optimism appearance in first-ever, state backed crypto education program that aims to onboard millions of Ukrainians in web3. We want to push even further, and build something undeniably strong for the long term- a beating heart of developers, creatives and public goods fighters. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? We are tackling long term oriented ecosystem development for Optimism in Ukraine from a variety of creative angles. Hackathons, meetups, user education, developer workshops, NFT activations, active OP community building in Ukraine, partnerships that\u2019ll lead to onboarding newcomers into Optimism & building stronger ecosystem. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The presence of Optimism in Ukraine will grow rapidly, resulting in the engagement of countless developers and true, value aligned torch carriers. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 200,000 $OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount? N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? N/A How will the OP tokens be distributed? 60k OP (30%) - Community events & Hackathons; Kyiv Tech Summit title sponsorship & hackathon prize pool OptimismUA NFT conference & OP Stack hackathon Quarterly OptimismUA community meetups & workshops Why: OP focused+featuring conferences, events & hackathons will lead onto building stronger OptimismUA community & Optimism brand awareness, usage & adoption. 80k OP (40%) - Growth initiatives; 10 month budget for community building, content creation, partnerships, other ops Branding, website, socials, swag Legal ops Why: We need to build strong brand and keep it consistent - sharing constant updates & value with OptimismUA community, be it with Optimism native ecosystem news, education content(original content, translations, viral content) and creative campaigns (ie. OP focused NFT art competition). We are also setting aside legal ops budget - if anything will remain, we\u2019ll redistribute it into OptimismUA growth initiatives. 60k OP (30%) - Incentivised initiatives; Funding Ukrainian crypto education programs ft. Optimism Funding OP promo content with best national crypto media; pr&marketing Why: Leveraging existing, strong tech&crypto communities will help us onboard new users into Optimism ecosystem faster, build stronger credibility and (hopefully) network effects. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? If the proposal will be approved (early March \u201823), we\u2019ll distribute 100% of the funds by the end of \u201823, sharing consistent forum reports reports & progress. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable.

Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? We want to build a grassroots, long lasting community movement, so that Optimism will always have a beating heart in Ukraine. We want to onboard developers, creatives, and public goods fighters to the ecosystem for the long term. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability: We\u2019re putting our personal reputation and brand of our existing projects (Atlantis World, KyivTech, Unchain, etc) on the line, and it\u2019s in our best interest to deliver on our promises. We\u2019ve been actively building within the Optimism ecosystem for over half year now, and genuinely fell in love with the vision, values, tech and beloved OP community. We\u2019re happy to build OptimismUA in public, share the reports needed and keep ourselves accountable, being part of Optimism ecosystem ourselves. ",
