We are working to create programs and protocols that better serve our builder community. If you are a builder or a Web3 project founder, please take 90 seconds to fill out this two-question survey. Thank you! [button]  As we head into Winter, GitcoinDAO looks to 2023, with upcoming \u201cAlpha Rounds\u201d and hackathons, a grants protocol launch in Spring, and an exciting new partnership with Unicef! Gitcoin has partnered with Unicef to run an Alpha Round to fund projects that address gaps in financial access, education and literacy, environment, and public health. This round will be the first of five test rounds run on our new grants protocol (currently in closed beta) as part of Gitcoin\u2019s Alpha test season. There is a Twitter Space happening on Tuesday, 12/6, to kick off the Alpha Round with Unicef. Follow the Gitcoin Twitter account here.  In DAO news, we recently approved five-out-of-five budget requests for GitcoinDAO workstreams. With the bear market, some Stewards and community members have expressed concern over the DAO\u2019s spending, and have expressed the desire for the DAO to reign in costs as we go into 2023, an indefinite bear market, and a looming global economic recession. With the acceptance of all workstream budget requests, the DAO will continue to operate as usual in S16, preparing for the launch of our upcoming Alpha Test Rounds, and continuing to build grants protocols. Additionally GitcoinDAO continues to support Web3 builders via hackathons and initiatives, including:  Hackathons hosted on Gitcoin\u2013currently there are six hackathons happening on Gitcoin!  Innovative new initiatives like \u201cBuidl in Public\u201d, where Gary Sheng works live with a single Web3 builder each week to help them create viable growth strategies to find product-market-fit and to grow their community and user base! Current and Upcoming Alpha Rounds, including the Fantom Alpha Round (submissions open \u2018til 12/4), and the upcoming Unicef Alpha Round! Both of these rounds are being run on Gitcoin\u2019s new grants protocol, which is currently in closed beta.   454\u00d7745 367 KB  Meme by McKennedy.eth. Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate!

Is Gitcoin over its skis? should we hold spending flat while addressing unavoidable risks? by epowell101 This post was originally posted on November 7th of this year. epowell101 asks if it \u201cmay be prudent to reduce speed and derisk the business while minimizing the ongoing reduction of our runway\u201d. Essentially, should GitcoinDAO should cut spending to ensure the continued existence of the DAO through an indefinite bear market? epowell101 suggests that implementing a system for tracking product development like Grafana may help with tracking costs. Myceliumcoordinator compares Gitcoin to Giveth in terms of spending and shipping of protocols over similar time periods and asks for a better explanation of what the true utility of the GTC token is.
