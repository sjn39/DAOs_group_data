Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  Check out the actions being taken (1, 2) to help improve Auction UIs and tools. New! Asset and Liability Framework Proposal for Stakeholders! December 2021 Core Unit expenses + 3-month forecast can be found here.     ICYMI - Announcements MakerDAO Actual Expenses vs Budget - December 2021 The recently ratified @strat-fin-core-unit published MakerDAO\u2019s Core Unit expenses for December 2021 along with a 3-month forecast. Below are some key data points from the update:  DAI expenses have increased to $2.4M in November ($29M annual run rate). Onboarding the Tech Ops and Strategic Finance increases our Dai burn by about $250K per month ($3M annualized). Expect expenses to increase by ~$130K per month ($39.3M in workforce expenses throughout 2022). An annual Oracle cost of $15.6M (Q1 estimate from Nik, annualized) results in an annual cash burn rate of $54.9M.  Gwei prices have increased thus far in 2022, offsetting some of the oracle cost favorability driven by lower ETH prices.      1450\u00d7155 8.7 KB   File with vesting schedule can be found here. Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management - 2022-02-02 As per the Interim Intangible Asset Assignment process, the sidestream-core-unit is requesting management access to the unified-auctions.makerdao.com domain currently owned by the @daif-core-unit. The purpose of this modification of management is for sidestream-core-unit to improve accessibility to auction-related UIs and tools. Maintaining a single domain helps improve UX for users to establish a flow in auction participation. Once it is feature-complete, sidestream-core-unit can potentially redirect from auctions.makerdao.com to unified-auctions.makerdao.com. The content will be publicly available & open source, which will allow the sidestream-core-unit to accept proposed changes by community members or other core units through pull requests. ALM framework for MakerDAO @strat-fin-core-unit publish a proposal for an Asset and Liability Management (ALM) framework to help optimize Maker\u2019s balance sheet and profitability for token holders while being subject to a certain set of risk constraints defined as solvency and liquidity. Presented below is a potential balance sheet structure for the end of 2022 (purely figurative)  strat-fin-core-unit list the balance sheet categories (from the most liquid to the least liquid):  Stablecoins > Money Markets > Short-term bonds > Crypto-backed loans > Institutional Vaults > Real-World Assets  On the liability side, which provides the funding of the asset part, there are currently two buckets:  Dai Surplus Buffer  Token holder profitability defined:  ALM focuses on the balance sheet; hence each balance sheet item will be assigned an annual percentage yield. If positive, the balance sheet item is producing profits. Most assets should produce revenues (e.g., loans will provide interest revenues). If negative, it is producing expenses. Those will be mainly liabilities (e.g., DAI Saving Rate, where the protocol incurs an expense to reward DAI stackers).   Original post further discusses APY and methods for token holder profitability.  Solvency:  Solvency is the constraint of having assets being worth more than liabilities, i.e., DAI being backed. This constraint is built deep into the Maker Protocol. If, at any point in time, there is insolvency, the protocol will issue MKR tokens on the market to build up reserves (more precisely removing the \u201cno longer backed\u201d DAI from the market). Maker also has a concept of Surplus Buffer that provides first loss protection.   Original post contains associated risks to solvency.  Liquidity:  In TradFi, the concept of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be converted into cash. Banks need to be able, at any time, to meet customer demand for deposit account withdrawal. MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have the same issue as DAI is not redeemable for anything (only for $1 of any kind of asset at Emergency Shutdown). Nevertheless, DAI should be worth $1 to fulfill its promise of being a stablecoin. Stablecoin holders should be able to use the stablecoin to buy something worth $1 on-chain or off-chain at any time. Therefore, while there is no contractual liquidity risk, the market demand liquidity DAI (ability to buy/sell DAI for $1 at scale in secondary markets) is to be taken\u2026   Original post contains associated risks to liquidity.  If the ALM proposal framework is accepted, @strat-fin-core-unit will define the risk parameters and provide a monthly (and/or real-time) report to monitor if the MakerDAO balance sheet is within the limits community agreed on. The proposal closes off with several open questions to the community.  We recommended you to read the actual post before engaging with these questions as it contains much more information than explained in this Tl;DR.)  Grant Announcement: KYC/AML Compliance Research @SES-Core-Unit welcomes Patrizia Crespi in support of navigating MakerDAO\u2019s know-your-customer / anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) compliance obligations. Patrizia is utilizing the MakerDAO SES Grants program to begin researching risks and solutions for KYC/AML regulatory management, which focuses on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF) updated guidance for Virtual Assets (VA) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) published in October 2021. Three deliverables are defined within the scope of this grant. They are:  A Feasibility Study advising on the impact of potential new laws and regulations based on FATF\u2019s guidance on DeFi and stable coins. The selection of AML tool(s) for MakerDAO with a demo conducted for the community to review. Serve as a point of contact for external compliance relations and queries for MakerDAO.  The estimated timeline for this initial grant was scoped at three months, starting in January with a budget of 1,500 Dai/month. In Q2 2022, MakerDAO SES will restructure its Incubator and Grants program to enable the incubation of up to 5 candidate facilitators per educational track. This means instead of incubating at most six core units at a time, the focus will be on preparing potentially 10-15 facilitators to run individual core units across three unique education tracks. Patrizia will help ensure the legal incubation track accomplishes the goal of setting up the critical legal infrastructure for MakerDAO. The SES Legal tracks will focus on:  RWA Legal Regulatory Compliance Advocacy & Public Policy Legal Entity Incorporation Services Legal Proxy / Legal advice coordination (TBD) Insurance  Patrizia\u2019s grant will continue into March 2022, with a final report delivered to the MakerDAO community covering the deliverables above. With SES\u2019s incubator restructuring, an additional deliverable of defining the mandate for a Regulatory Compliance Core Unit is in scope. Her grant is planned to evolve into incubating this core unit, alongside several other legal core units entering the inaugural season of SES\u2019s cohort incubator. SES Legal introduced Patrizia on January 28th\u2019s Weekly Status Update call; the recording can be found here. Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management 2022-02-01 The moment we have been waiting for; @Growth-Core-Unit follows the Interim Intangible Asset Assignment process to request management over the MakerDAO Twitter account currently owned by the daif-core-unit. Management access to the account will improve outreach, communication, and synergies to the protocol.  The key missions of Maker\u2019s Twitter account are to build strong brand awareness, strengthen the protocol\u2019s influence in the crypto scene and create business opportunities (e.g., strategic partnerships). Not to mention that this channel will bring to Maker valuable insights on the market sentiment.  The MakerDAO Twitter account is essential to succeed and meet these key missions. Management of the account by Growth-Core-Unit presents many benefits:  The account will be a key additional resource and leverage to successfully achieve the protocol\u2019s ambition. Identifying more strategic partnerships across verticals and regions. Improving worldwide understanding of the full potential of Dai, leading to more Dai being used by more users. The account will be a channel to communicate about the lending services of Maker and potentially engage with new leads. Currently, the MakerGrowth Twitter account has 4.2k followers\u2013management of the MakerDAO Twitter account will increase outreach by 45-fold!    Next steps:  During the first months, we want to give a neutral voice to the Maker account to keep everyone informed about the DAO news:  Launches: including protocol announcements, partnerships, and activation campaigns. Information coming from the coordination calls and the announcements planning with other CUs. Governance: including current polls, results of the votes, and forum at a glance. Information coming from the GovComms CU. DAO news: including news from CUs and the public call\u2019s agenda. We will re-tweet tweets from CUs accounts, delegates, and community members to help them to increase visibility. Alerts: Critical information that needs immediate attention. We\u2019ll get this information from any CU with this need.   Growth-Core-Unit speaks on measuring the success of the MakerDAO Twitter account management by monitoring performance based on the following indicators:  Number of followers New followers Number of new tweets Likes and retweets Tweet impressions Engagement rate Top tweets by the metrics described above New activation campaigns with strategic partners Engagement rate of the activation campaigns  This is huge news, but don\u2019t be worried! Growth-Core-Unit will continue to voice and personality the account by explaining everything with memes and showcasing partners. They have already built a 7-month strategy focusing on useful MakerDAO updates, such as ideas, discussions, and implementations. There will also be educational content about crypto, DeFi, and MakerDAO, directly or indirectly related to our work as a Core Unit. And, of course, we can\u2019t forget about the partnerships, initiatives, and goals achieved by Growth-Core-Unit. Unified Auctions UI Release v0.6.0 - January 28th 2022 @sidestream-core-unit brings us their ~monthly Unified Auctions UI update! In response to Flappy Friday, the team realized that the current state of cluttered auction UIs caused users much confusion. The sidestream-core-unit wants to unify all functionality into a single UI. In the meantime, they have made updates as short-term measures to help provide users with the best guidance. The landing pageof the Unified Auctions UI provides an entry point for the auction user and lists different services relevant for each auction type. The Unified Auctions UI currently supports flashloan based auction participation but does not enable users to bid on an auction with their own DAI as of yet. sidestream-core-unit implemented a note for these users pointing to the old Liquidation Portal. The sidestream-core-unit has coordinated with dux-core-unit and will add a banner to the old Liquidations Portal to inform users of the Unified Auctions UI and its functionality to engage in auctions via flashloan. The team also pushed progress on the development of the Unified Auctions UI by taking a step to fully streamline the onboarding process of new collateral types to the UI, which is currently their focus topic to add dynamic support of relevant exchange-callee contracts in the next sprint. The team responded to their last release notes and changed the default network to mainnet. In addition, introduce animation for number changes for visual improvement. As part of the open-sourcing, the sidestream-core-unit secured out the repository so that a malicious attacker/ cannot leak credentials or force resource usage (increasing money spent and blocking development). To do so, they have disallowed forks from executing CI pipelines and made sure that our CI system can only be used by organization members - see a bad actor trying to destroy our codebase in this pull request. All of the work performed by the sidestream-core-unit is open-source and can be found in their GitHub Repository. RWF-001 Auditor Flow @Real-World-Finance will submit its new budget implementation for the March cycle with the new wallet setup shown:   The budget implementation will follow standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit and involve a setup with an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet topped up every month with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce as much as possible the overhead for Maker governance.  While designing the budget, Real-World-Finance kept in mind paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit, providing the protocol control over funds held in the Auditor Wallet, reducing governance overhead to a minimum, and providing full transparency and be kept in check by a group of trusted auditors. The multi-sig wallets are detailed in the original post, including the Auditor Wallet and the Operational Wallet. Also, Within the first five days of each month, Real-World-Finance will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet. The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in their GitHub repository - WIP. Real-World-Finance also provides a monthly cycle, which contains more details in the original post:  Monthly Budget Statement Submission Transaction Request Submission Returning Excess Funds DssVest Pull Auditor\u2019s Review Transaction Approvals Auditor Wallet Returns  Honorable Mention! ConsolFreight taps into Maker\u2019s Vault @AleG updates the community with some cool news; Consolfreight provides TradeFi solutions for a transaction involving the Canadian government and its efforts to fight Covid-19.  The Government of Ontario placed an order for 3,500 units of air purifying machines to be installed through the school system in the state worth CAD 4,339,895. The bid was granted to a local SME, eSupply, who was able to find the liquidity needed to procure and deliver the units in DeFi. We have provided 280K Dai towards the total amount of the purchase order, and we are handling the logistics in order to provide certainty across the supply chain and minimize any potential risk with the transaction. It will be good to mention that Consolfreight complied with the soft covenants for the vault. An example of the soft covenants is - single loaned asset (either cargo or factoring) must not exceed 15% of the maximum Vault DC i.e., 300K This transaction also allows us to test our integration to Centrifuge via Defactor (a protocol that optimizes access to liquidity for Asset Originators in the DeFi space), helping us expedite and simplify the operational process. We are looking forward to adding RWA use cases, especially during this pandemic, and supporting our community to grow their potential.   Looking for more posts and updates?

You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Auction-backed Dai As monet-supply and OxToes reignited discussions on NFTs as collateral, juan from SES published a rough workflow of a mechanism that can provide backed Dai through an auction system. The written process isn\u2019t meant to be complete and stands as a general design that holds many questions for the community and members to help work on.  697\u00d71263 41.8 KB  Juan also provides some apparent advantages and disadvantages:  Pro: Users will be able to use NFTs to mint Dai. Pro: Potential to become a major player in the NFT market. Con: Requires a large bandwidth and time spent. Con: Double-collateralization of Dai causes capital inefficiency. Con: Our auction system will have to be one of the best in the world.  [Informal Poll] Discontinuation of G&R Call Snippets Snippets were first introduced by juan, Anna, and twblack88 prior to the ratification of @gov-comms-core-unit. However, different times now pose different circumstances such as the evolution of the Governance and Risk Call and publications of comprehensive semi-transcription summaries. Artem_Gordon raises the question of whether G&R Call snippets remain valuable and asks the community if they should be discontinued for the following reasons:   All of the semi-transcription summary information repeat the Snippets. Most of the Snippet information, such as the slide deck, MIPs update, and Forum update, can be found on the forums beforehand. Snippets clutter the G&R Call threads and essentially take up significant space making the semi-> transcription more difficult to locate. Snippets are live notes that take up valuable time, which can be used to improve the slide deck, be more active during the call, and be more helpful to the call host(s). (Personal) Snippets are prepared and completed right after the Forum at a Glance and right before (and throughout) the G&R call - I do not get much of a hiatus for about 4-5 hours.   Please note that semi-transcription summaries will remain. The informal poll will close next week, Thursday, February 10th, which provides a one-week decision period before the next G&R Call. How to make 320M DAI disappear (aka why Accounting matters) Having inaccurate data can easily lead to poor decisions either by ourselves or others, which is why the @strat-fin-core-unit spends a lot of time checking data and analyzing discrepancies. In a short post of actionable steps, SebVentures shows how someone can make 320M DAI, \u201cbadly\u201d accounted for, disappear:  572\u00d71015 140 KB  The concern in accounting and applications has been previously discussed and is again brought to light to help spread awareness on the importance of accounting for the protocol. Obtaining a Marketing Core Unit For several months, the community has inquired \u201cwen marketing CU??\u201d \u2026 insert meme here\u2026 In response, LongForWisdom published a structure on the governance action, MIP13, that can be taken to make it easier for MakerDAO to attract individuals or entities wishing to fulfill that role. MIP13 allows an author to publish a post stating MakerDAO wants to employ a marketing Core Unit, which will be formally voted on. The vote results can locate interested parties and help guide the structure of potential application proposals. LongForWisdom explains that there is no limit to what a declaration of intent can include; the possibilities are only limited by the author\u2019s imagination and their ability to convince MKR Holders that their ideas for incentivization have merit. In conclusion, LongForWisdom asks the community to help make a difference in the DAO by engaging to fix problems by utilizing MIP13 or other actions such as writing bounties.  The only thing GovAlpha will veto is payments to delegates or voters for voting in favor of a given proposal because this can be considered a governance attack.    Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 gbMKR, a proposal to benefit long-term MKR holders Signal Request Ends February 8th In response to feedback to their recent proposal, @paraficapital adds a few improvements and initiates a signal request to the community asking whether MakerDAO should implement gbMKR. [Signal Request] Raise Gemini Dollar (GUSD) PSM Debt Ceiling To 60 Million DAI  Signal Request Ends February 8th The newly onboarded PSM-GUSD has a debt ceiling of 10m DAI and is currently close to capacity. In order to increase the diversification of stablecoin reserves, GFX Labs wants to raise the debt ceiling to 60 million DAI, which would represent approximately 32% of the outstanding GUSD float; this is in line with what could be covered by the Stability Buffer in a worst-case scenario. In an effort to push this proposal, GFXlabs asks the community where the PSM-GUSD debt ceiling should be raised to 60 million DAI, [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Signal Request Ends February 4th With the executive vote that was recently scheduled, we are going to have the Surplus Buffer set to 250 MM so no further burning will happen anytime soon (discussion). This has been done as a counteraction of the events of last friday is meant as a short term fix. Hexonaut from the Protocol Engineering Team already has drafted a more sustainable solution that has the potential to be activated on mainnet soon. This will introduce rate limiting into the Flapper, limiting the number of parallel auctions. However, multiple ideas of replacing the current Flapper have been floating around in the past. In response, @ultraschuppi submits a Signal Request to find out whether the community would like to either (A) do nothing and not burn any more MKR until we have a long term solution in place, or (B) introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper and bring back MKR burning as soon as possible. Offloading TUSD-A Signal Request Ends February 4th A discussion and signal-request submitted over a year ago passed and set the Debt Ceiling of TUSD-A to 0 DAI. Today, there is still about ~26MM DAI of outstanding debt, and the increase of the Stability Fee to 1% has not changed anything. In response, ultraschuppi offers three options as potential changes to TUSD-A and asks the community whether they want to:  Offload to a new TUSD-PSM with a DC of 0. Activate liquidations on TUSD-A keepers. Keep as is and do nothing.
