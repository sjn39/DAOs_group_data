                    "content": " Maker Operational Manual  Announcement After a lot of hard work, GovAlpha is happy to announce the launch of the Maker Operational Manual!  1211\u00d7822 91.8 KB  The Manual aims to become the main source of information and documentation to make Governance more accessible and navigable for the whole community. A good part of this documentation already existed. The Manual intends to organize and present this content in a more organized and approachable fashion as well as to add new resources. The first section, MakerDAO, covers MIPs and Core Units under the Structure subsection and outlines some of our numbers - Status & Dashboard + Core Unit Budget Flow - under the Overview subsection. The Governance section covers the Governance cycles, a guide to voting on-chain and off-chain, an overview of the verification process for executive votes, and a full subsection on Delegation. Finally, the last two sections are the Parameters and Modules index. This is a forever work-in-progress project. Some of our future goals are:  keep the manual up-to-date provide a Spanish version update existing parameters and modules and add new ones  We are calling all Core Units to reach out if you believe you might have documentation that would find a good home on the manual. If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know. We are open and eager to get your feedback! We hope that you will appreciate this new resource! Thanks to all the contributors: @Patrick_J @AstronautThis @blimpa @LongForWisdom @prose11 @Derek @SebVentures @liberuum @Retro @SES-Core-Unit @GovAlpha-Core-Unit ",
