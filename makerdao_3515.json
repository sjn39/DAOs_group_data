                    "content": "Hello all, I hadn\u2019t followed the recent increases to the dust/debt floor parameters for the various vaults, and wanted to chime in with some thoughts. Specifically, I think we should be allowing repayments to vaults where the repayment<existing debt<debt floor, instead of requiring that repayments = debt where debt<debt floor. As a smallholder of an ETH-A vault with less than 5000 DAI with a recent windfall, I thought I\u2019d put some of it toward paying off my DAI debt, and realized that this wasn\u2019t possible unless I paid off the debt in its entirety. I get the logic behind raising the debt floor: we want the minimum size of a vault position to be such that profits from liquidating it are equal to at least the cost of participating in the liquidation auction. So, payments that take the vault debt from above the threshold to below the threshold are a no go. Mints are also a no go. That much is clear. But a payment on a debt already below the floor only reduces the size of the pool of capital that\u2019s at risk of undercollateralizing the peg, ie, positions that wouldn\u2019t get liquidated during a flash crash. In the meantime, smallholders like me who may or may not have the capital to pay off what can be several thousand dollars all at once are forced to allow interest to accrue continuously until they can save up the money to pay it off in one go. Gross. Is there something I\u2019m missing here? If the debt floor were not reflective of the natural equilibrium point for liquidation participation, and that point was actually lower, bad actors could repay just enough to stay below that threshold, keep from being liquidated. However, this seems like a non-issue for 2 reasons:  If the debt floor is higher than the natural participation threshold, then we\u2019re already liquidating sufficient positions. Debt floor should be set based not just on auction participation costs, but also on the basis of where too much capital exists below the liquidation participation threshold in aggregate. Remember, you can\u2019t open a vault under the debt floor, and you can\u2019t repay when the repayment would take your debt below the floor. There are immensely diminishing returns for a bad actor in this situation, and they\u2019re one-way. If I wanted to game the system in this scenario, I\u2019d need a huge number of legacy vaults that happened to fall below the debt floor after a debt floor increase\u2013something that you couldn\u2019t initiate. Once I played keep-away from the liquidators, I can\u2019t mint more DAI unless I put myself back above the debt floor. You could certainly capitalize on that opportunity if you happened into it, but it\u2019s an edge case of an edge case.  Thoughts? ",

This may be hard for some to believe but not everyone works a white-collar job, or even a decent job. I\u2019m a grunt, I do \u201cshitwork\u201d for a living, earn anywhere between $200 and $500 a week (depending on availability of work; there are some weeks I can\u2019t get any work), and I have a family that I need to feed. I want to build a passive income for them so that if something happens to me they\u2019re taken care of in some way; this was going a lot better before the debt ceiling was raised. Now, between the gas prices and some (poor, I think) decisions on the DAO\u2019s part, it is almost impossible for me to get any traction whatsoever with Maker. I\u2019ve made more progress on that front just this week with Bancor than I have in my entire time using Maker. I can\u2019t be the only one here in the situation. Overall, I think the move may have shafted a lot more people than the others seem to realize. It was my understanding that one of the foci of this DAO was to make available to the common man the set of tools for high finance. If I\u2019m correct about this, then have we strayed from that focus? Because it certainly feels to me like we have. Yes. We should allow those payments. But we should lower the debt floor, it is too high for the system to be in any way usable by people like me. ",

Not to be that guy that suggests YAVT, but perhaps we could experiment with a vault type with a lower debt floor and <dust debt repayments but with a vastly lower DC and see how that plays out alongside the current setup? The thought being that we should have options for everybody, wider nets and all that.

Scaling is coming, whether by migration to L2s, reduced congestion because others migrate to L2s, and soon enough (ETHGlobal summit today had October '21 as the target date!) the merge. I hope that that reenables people like you and I who don\u2019t have a lot of capital to access these financial primitives. However, scaling will likely continue to be an arms race: build a network 100x as performant as ETH1 to handle more volume, and instead, increased adoption puts us at 10x the number of transactions, but ecosystem growth and complexity of what we\u2019re doing on the network will also increase by 10x, and then we\u2019re back where we are now. Not unlike dialup to DSL to cable to fiber: the content and number of users will likely keep pace with and/or outstrip the network. For Maker and the vaults, that means that any of the processes that are contingent on the degree of network congestion are going to cause some problems.

My guess is that since the floor was so low at the start, it simply may not have been considered a realistic possibility that such a situation would really arise; no one could have predicted just how well things have gone for DeFi over the past year or two. As for what we can do about it, agreed, I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t work towards allowing this. ",

You have to estimate gas costs (which is already a huge issue, hopefully 1559 helps us all out here), and you have to estimate the proceeds of the auction. Very tricky. While I want to move forward with the thrust of my OP, which is just getting the ability to partially repay debts for vaults that are already under the debt ceiling, I think there\u2019s absolutely a broader discussion to be had about trying to calculate a debt floor on the fly instead of making it something we have to set arbitrarily via governance, particularly because it\u2019s intended to mitigate a risk that, should it occur (ie, spike in gas prices) will happen fast, faster than governance. I\u2019m curious why 5000 DAI (seems like a very round figure to me) is the floor for ETH-A vaults. Like I said, skimmed a handful of threads but didn\u2019t see anything that got into the numbers off the top of my head, but that\u2019s me not looking\u2013anyone here followed that conversation closely enough to throw me a link? eg, what\u2019s the expected gross profit on a liquidation auction as a percentage of the loan balance? That seems like the relevant info here. ",

Currently, my understanding is that you already can\u2019t open a vault with debt  debt floor result in debt < debt floor afterward. If you\u2019re already above the debt floor, things stay exactly the same. But if you\u2019re not, then allow partial repayment.

That said, I think @ccc made a good point earlier in the thread: Maker purports to bring finance to the people. And as I was saying earlier myself, scaling will continue to be an arms race, much like any in demand network. can you elaborate just a bit more on the dust mechanism for us? Like, what was the origin of the parameter in the protocol? I know that in some other contracts, dust can refer to the small-time scale accrued fractions of a token that night be left in an address even after you attempt \u201czero\u201d the balance, like paying off a continuous interest debt in Maker, or withdrawing your earnings from a Yearn Vault. Is that how the dust piece originated here, and it\u2019s now being conveniently repurposed as a debt floor? I guess where I\u2019m trying to go with this line of thought is that at some point in the future, I\u2019d love to see us (don\u2019t get me wrong\u2013us is really not me at all, I appreciate the immense body of work the whole Maker team has done!) split out the debt floor away from the dust mechanism-- if my assumptions about dust are correct above --and take steps to help the little guys by letting people do partial repayments when they\u2019re already under the debt floor.

The change should be fully compatible with your Vault as it exists now. Additionally, Ethereum as it exists now is in the middle of switching from a Proof of Work based security model to a Proof of Stake model. Proof of Work = Ethereum 1, Proof of Stake = Ethereum 2. The process of switching over will involve merging the existing ETH1 chain into the ETH2 network. This is unrelated to 1559 above, but the v2 you referenced makes me think you might have them confused. The merge into ETH2 should also not affect your vault. However, the point of moving to  a PoS model and of doing the upgrade is the scaling that that brings to the table, so hopefully at that point, fees will be tenable for even the littlest of goldfish. My understanding is that you can repay your debt to zero without \u201cclosing\u201d your vault\u2013ie, it will still be there even if you don\u2019t have any collateral deposited or any debt owed, so if you have the capital to pay back all of your debt now, go for it\u2013it won\u2019t close any doors to using the vault in the future, and you won\u2019t need to restart anything later.
