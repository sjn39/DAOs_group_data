Specifically, more strictly defining how payments are sent and buffers reported as well as changing a few parameters. I\u2019ve also added an explicit stream duration as previously this was just assumed to be 6 months. The Sequencer can also set custom windows per network now.

This is something GovAlpha had previously discussed internally with regard to MIP63. For example, MIP40 contains a 12-month restriction for CU budgets, but at present, MIP63 has no such restriction. Such a restriction would encourage keepers to demonstrate to Governance that they have been providing good value to the Protocol when asking for ongoing funding. ",
