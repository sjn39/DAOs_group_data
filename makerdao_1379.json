Sentence Summary This Budget Proposal for DAI expenses aims to fund the activities of the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) as described in MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation.  Paragraph Summary This Budget Proposal for DAI expenses aims to fund the activities of the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) as described in MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation. This budget is necessary to fund DAIF-001 activities in its second budget year  Specification  Motivation Planning for the best case scenario for MakerDAO requires establishing measures to protect Maker\u2019s intangible assets and preparing to mitigate problems in worst case scenarios:  What if somebody launches a coin on some other blockchain and calls it Dai? What if somebody uses the software developed for the Maker Protocol for purposes that go against the principles of MakerDAO? What if there is a governance attack and the attackers get control over the Maker and Dai trademarks?  The independent legal entity Dai Foundation has been created to safeguard what cannot be decentralized in MakerDAO, such as ownership of trademarks, domains, software copyrights, etc., which is connected to a real-world centralized governance body. Dai Foundation cannot seek profits and is only mandated to serve its specific purpose: to safeguard the Maker Assets. The Dai Foundation is making these assets available for use by the community to support the sustainability and growth of the Maker Protocol with as few barriers as possible. The DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) is the vehicle that enables the practical implementation of these critical goals.  Core Unit ID DAIF-001  List of Budget Implementations  Base Budget Implementation The DAIF-001 budget includes operational costs and buildup of reserves. The budget starts September 1st, 2022 but can only be approved in time for the first payments to start October 1st, 2022. We therefore suggest three budget streams:  First operational payout in the budget year:  A total of 76,561 DAI will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-10-31.   Operational payout for the remainder of the year:  A total of 376,796 DAI will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-11-1 and ending 2023-08-31.   Payout to build up reserves in the last three months of 2022:  A total of 270,000 DAI will be streamed to 0x5F5c328732c9E52DfCb81067b8bA56459b33921f starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-12-31.     Some Background  DAIF-001 will use the budget reporting template from the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001), and expect to start reporting into the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) Budget Tool once we have closed the books for June 2022. Below we illustrate the implementation for the base case. Here  the payment stream from the first budget year is included for context with the amounts striked out. On the next figure we show payments streams with base case, bear, and super bear side by side for the coming year. The current first year\u2019s budget is expected to be fully spent. This is due to extraordinary expense we expect to pay in July 2022. The Reserves Buildup transfer for this budget proposal is split over two installments to enable a more gradual buildup, but both are executed in 2022 to ensure they are included in the annual reporting for 2022 which Dai Foundation is required to do in Denmark. The monthly amounts are averaged to a large degree to facilitate implementation. The payment stream in the first budget year for the first month included the payment for the second and third month. Thus the first years payment stream included payment for 14 months. The first two months of the budget are received in the first budget year\u2019s payment stream (2 x $38,599). Depending on which budget is accepted, these two months will either have a shortfall or a surplus. The first payout in the new stream takes this shortfall/surplus into consideration. The two last months in the payment stream builds buffer for the operations of next budget year; they have been set to be the same amount as in the last month of this budget year. The payment stream for this budget year includes payment for 12 months. The approval of this budget proposal cannot be implemented in an executive vote until some time in September 2022. This first payment is thus set for October 2022 and it will include payment for the first and second month.

A Note about the Reserves Buildup The Dai Foundation is set up to operate in perpetuity. To ensure this isn\u2019t endangered by any individual event, it is important for Dai Foundation to have a \u201cwar chest\u201d to cover extraordinary expenses or temporary issues with funding of day-to-day operations. Examples of events for which Dai Foundation may need access to reserves to continue operation:  Regulatory or other action which means the contributions from the Protocol to cover daily operations are cut off for a period that may last up to three years A lawsuit like the one that was seen after the \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d event in 2020. At that time, Dai Foundation was hit with a class action lawsuit. As an entity safeguarding Maker\u2019s intangible assets, Dai Foundation will be the main or rather the only centralized entity to target. Defending against lawsuits can be very expensive \u2014 an estimate of legal cost of $1M in connection with a big US lawsuit is not unrealistic. Events where Directors and Officer Insurance is required \u2014 e.g., a lawsuit where board members are sued individually. It is very expensive for Dai Foundation to acquire a Directors and Officers insurance, so as a backup there should be sufficient reserves for Dai Foundation to provide the same cover for its board members as is available to board members in similar foundations, e.g., a coverage up to $2M.  Based on the above, Dai Foundation is aiming to build up reserves of at least $3M, where the protocol donated $2M to reserves the first year. The buildup of the remaining $1M has been split out over four years where the amount this year is $270,000 Dai.  Increasing Value to Maker Tokenholders Dai Foundation ensures that the Maker trademarks cannot come under control of a malicious party in case of a governance attack. Scammers and impersonators reduce the trust and value of the Maker brand. Dai Foundation ensures there is clarity around and enforcement of the Maker trademarks, thereby helping protect Maker tokenholders from lower value due loss of trust in the Maker brand. DAIF-001 is an enabler that helps other Core Units and actors achieve their MakerDAO objectives. DAIF-001 enables growth initiatives by making required intangible assets available to those initiatives with as little friction as possible while ensuring those assets remain under Maker Governance control. As new assets are created we provide guidance and tools to make it easy for contributors to hand over copyrights and other IP rights for the assets to Dai Foundation so these assets become public goods for all of MakerDAO.  Roadmap and Objectives The Core Unit mandate describes the responsibilities of DAIF-001 and the associated objectives. The budget requested is for ongoing activities in the areas of:  Make existing assets available to the community with as little friction as possible, and keep the Asset Registry up to date. Ensure new assets becomes public goods for the DAO. Protect the trademarks and act against scammer and infringers. Increase transparency. Follow Maker Governance discussions in order to always have sufficient context in case a crisis appears which might be a governance attack.   Planned Near-term Activities  Solicit applications from prospective Maker Governance appointed board members and work with GovAlpha on the process for Maker Governance selection/approval of candidates. Publish guidelines and tools for ensuring MakerDAO funded software has its copyright assigned to Dai Foundation. Ask questions to Core Units to provide better transparency of the IP status of their assets. Issue call for grant applications to describe and discuss the relationship between DAOs, their intangible assets, and intellectual property. Enable Core Units to host their own email providers on the  *.makerdao.com or *.makerdao.network subdomains Collaborate closely with the incubating Brand Core Unit about how to re-activate the MakerDAO website and blog (pending approval of budget for the Brand Core Unit). Establish clear channels for reporting scammers and infringers and a status page to see whether a site already has been reported and what the progress is in closing those down. Define and document necessary asset management processes in the DAO and automate them as much as possible in order to reduce friction and expensive manual handling.

We are aiming only to spend what is necessary to fulfill our mandate with a view of being able to do this in perpetuity.  That said, our operational budget could function with 10% less runway for a limited period. In this eventuality, we will scale the amount of travel back, not do any website/educational development, and only onboard one Maker Governance appointed board member. When including reserves, this is a 6.5% reduction compared to the base budget.  Super Bear Case: Our Super Bear scenario. The bare minimum for fulfilling our mandate during a limited period of time could theoretically be done with an operational budget 24% smaller than the base case. Here we would defer having more members join the board. Travel would be scaled down to an absolute minimum. We would only act to shut down scamming sites and to pursue trademark infringements as our reduced bandwidth would allow. Core Units and other Content Managers of MakerDAO intangible assets (subdomains, emails, SoMe channels, etc.) would be asked to cover the expenses (techops and admin) related to configuring and documenting the status of the assets they manage (which really just kicks the can down the road).  When including reserves, we would postpone requesting reserves buildup for the budget period, which yields up to a 52% reduction compared to the base case. In a Bull scenario we anticipate more activity around utilizing and harvesting MakerDAO intangible assets plus more legal IP questions, which would require additional spending on TechOps, Facilitator, and legal services. We have not quantified this, but will return with a subproposal if the Bull market returns in this budget period and more services are needed to avoid hampering the growth of other MakerDAO initiatives.   Unwinding and Defunding Dai Foundation is bound by its mandate and set to operate in perpetuity. We have thus no unwinding scenario. Should Maker Governance decide not to fund DAIF-001, then Dai Foundation will do its best to provide the MakerDAO community with access to its intangible assets based on a blend of the actual users covering the expenses and a limited draw on the reserves until funding issues are resolved.

                    "content": "Hello @CodeKnight, thanks for your questions. Let me give a bit of important background first before diving into the explanation of the budget. Why was the Dai Foundation created in the first place? The vision for the Maker Protocol is of course to be successful and run forever. As you may know, before the launch of the protocol, the Maker Foundation was the original organization created to launch and bootstrap the protocol. By its design, the organization was then dissolved to avoid it remaining a centralization force in the protocol. This is where the question originated: what to do with the Intellectual Property of MakerDAO, the ownership of which cannot be decentralized like its other infrastructure. Indeed, to maintain the trust in the MakerDAO brand, and to protect against a fork taking over the MAKER and DAI names it is important to ensure the safeguarding of the MakerDAO intangible assets. For this unique task, Maker Foundation therefore created a non-profit foundation, the Dai Foundation, with the limited and specific mandate to safeguard these intangible assets of MakerDAO. The non-profit foundation board is bound by the mandate, and the board ensures that Maker Governance controls who can use the intangible assets owned by Dai Foundation. Dai Foundation is set to operate in perpetuity like the Maker Protocol, and must be robust enough to ensure longevity, especially in the face of potential Maker Governance drama. As for the board structure, it is important to have deep expertise in legal, regulatory, business, and protocol/DAO matters represented on the board. It is also important to have a board of a certain size to make it harder for an attacker to take over board control by corrupting individual members of the board. Following the same adversarial logic that we are used to in line with the Maker ethos. This all makes sense considering that, after the dissolution of Maker Foundation, Dai Foundation is the sole legal entity to target for attacks - to extract money and/or to take over the MakerDAO IP. We have already been sued once as described in the budget proposal. Therefore we need reserves to ensure robustness and to be able to fight off attacks. What does this mean for the budget? The strategy outlined above means that Dai Foundation requires funds to  Ensure a long runway Operate the non-profit foundation legal entity Maintain a sufficient large board membership  Ensuring a long runway requires the reserves we are requesting. In a crisis situation we may need to have large amounts of cash immediately. The happy path for drawing funds from the DAO with a MIP that needs to go through the Governance cycle takes at least 55 days afaik before the transfer can happen. If there is a large disagreement among Maker Governance about direction of the protocol during a crisis, a transfer of funds to Dai Foundation may become part of the disagreement and thus be held up. We cannot rely on this, but need to have reserves at hand and to ensure the longevity of the Dai Foundation. Operational expenses include what we, as a legal entity, need to do in order to operate within the requirements in our jurisdiction, to maintain and protect the intangible assets, and to make them available for the community under Maker Governance control. The Dai Foundation currently has a five member board. The extension to seven members is because we promised as part of our budget request last year to extend the board with two members appointed by Maker Governance. This should provide better protection against corruption or conflicts of interest influencing the board, and it should reduce fears of non-transparent dealings by the board. We also need to offer our board members a protection against being targeted personally in legal proceedings that is similar to what board members in other foundations enjoy. Given the industry we are in, Directors and Officer Insurance is extremely expensive and has to be paid whether it is used or not, so IMO we are financially prudent by relying on the reserves for this protection. Why is it difficult to compare this with other DAOs? I believe it is hard to make direct comparisons because we are solving a task that other DAOs will have to confront as they move to real decentralization / become aware of the critical importance of being able to safeguard their IP. You\u2019re asking for examples of DAOs that were attacked and had their IP stolen. I\u2019m wondering if MakerDAO wants to wait and see, relying on chance, or if it\u2019s more aligned with the Maker ethos to be better prepared than others\u2026 to have our contingencies mapped out?  (While none in my family have died from driving without their seatbelt on, I still use a seatbelt  ) I am not aware of DAOs of similar size and age as MakerDAO that have reached the same levels of decentralization. What you often see is that major DeFi protocols have an associated legal entity (like Maker Foundation) that hires developers, perform marketing etc, and also takes care of IP matter either in-company or by supporting a special entity set up to handle this - in the same way as Maker Foundation provided services to Dai Foundation until it was dissolved. In such cases IP protection costs are often spread out over several functions and not reported specifically. ",

                    "content": "It is critical that the intangible assets of MakerDAO are safeguarded. This does not happen by default which is why Dai Foundation was formed. The Dai Foundation Core Unit may not be as visible as other Core Units due to the mandate of Dai Foundation which means that while we have to stay very much up to date with what is happening in the DAO, we are not to engage in any day to day operational activities and conflicts beyond the services that the Dai Foundation Core Unit provides to the DAO. Likewise, there are situations where we cannot share many details publicly about ongoing cases to enforce the MakerDAO IP rights as that will put us in a less favorable position vis a vis our counterpart. I hope that everybody that cares for a long life for MakerDAO agrees that one should not be complacent about safeguarding trademarks and other intangible assets of something as important as what we have built\u2026 To provide more insight I want to provide more transparent context on the different scenarios that have been put forward in our current budget application  The Base Scenario - Reduction in 73% compared to the already approved budget The Base Scenario is a reconfiguration of year two in the three year budget that MKR voters approved last year with two major differences. The first difference is the old budget included adding $1M DAI to the Dai Foundation reserves to bring them to the $3M required to address the risks currently seen. Given the circumstances, we have decided to spread this ask out over the next four years, which means the ask for this year\u2019s budget has been brought down to $270K DAI. In absolute numbers we have reduced our budget with 73% compared to the three year budget that MKR voters approved last year. The second differenceI want to call out is that in the \u201cold\u201d budget we assumed a yearly inflation of 1-2%. The inflation is currently beyond 10% which normally affects the costs of professional services and compensation, so the effective budget reduction in the base scenario is actually larger than the 73%.  The Bear Scenario - Reduction in 6.5% compared to Base Scenario (The operational cost reduction is 10% compared to the Base Scenario) This scenario reflects that we recognize that DAO currently is struggling with the balance between revenue and expenses, and if MKR Governance decides that this shall mean a significant reduction in overall expenses then we have looked at where we can contribute with the least disruption to our activities.  In the base scenario we budget with having two Maker Governance approved members join the board. In the Bear scenario we cut down on web site development/documentation and only plan to have one extra member join the board.We are also reducing the planned travel 50%.  It is critical that the board is up to date with the happenings in the DAO in case a crisis like a governance attack occurs. As a consequence of the Bear scenario the board will have less ability to meet and engage with MakerDAO community members during in-person events. In an ideal world all relevant information should be available virtually, but this is not the case in practice, and meeting with stakeholders face to face is one of the most efficient ways to close this information gap.  The Super Bear scenario - Reduction in 52% compared to Base Scenario (The operational cost reduction is 24% compared to the Base Scenario) We have seen the Super Bear scenario as a situation where MakerDAO is looking at a situation of running out of funds over the next year - where extraordinary measures have to be taken and it is accepted that normal day to day operations cannot be sustained.  The Super Bear Scenario includes:   There will be no contribution to the reserves that are kept as a \u201cwar-chest\u201d in case it is necessary to perform legal action to protect MakerDAO assets, to answer legal action against us and provide our own insurance for individual board members. Potential counter parties will surely make note of this.   Core Units and other Content Managers of MakerDAO intangible assets (subdomains, emails, SoMe channels, etc.) may be asked to cover some of the expenses (techops and admin) related to configuring and documenting the status of the assets they manage, which really just shifts expenses to other CU\u2019s with additional overhead.   There will be no focused effort on shutting down scamming sites   We will defer having more members join the board.   It obviously is up to the voting MKR holders to decide which scenario to fund, but the Super Bear Scenario isn\u2019t just another tack down from the Bear Scenario for Dai Foundation Core Unit. It puts Dai Foundation in a more risky position and limits the amount of service we can deliver to the DAO - for example in ensuring that new assets are becoming public goods as well. At the time of writing several @Recognized-Delegates have abstained on the budget vote. I do hope this additional information will result in the abstainers moving their vote (preferably to the Base or Bear Scenario).  Final Thoughts It is a sad fact that the structure required to safeguard intangible assets with as little centralization as possible has an overhead - for example due to the costs to operate a foundation and pay compensation to a sufficient number of board members. However, if you look at the compensation of the individual persons and weigh that against the tasks they are performing, the insights they are providing and the increased risks they have to accept, then this certainly isn\u2019t a walk in the park for any of our Board Members . Do also note that because we have to deliver the same service whether we are in a bull market or a bear market we do not receive any MKR bonus, so we are in a situation where we do not participate in the upside when things are going well, but we are still compelled to provide budget scenarios where we participate in the downside. This is an understandable part of the role the Board of Trustees play. Finally, while the Super Bear Scenario includes NOT extending the board, no matter which scenario wins I urge Maker Community members to signal their interest in helping safeguard the MakerDAO assets as we at any time can face a situation where existing board members may want to step down. At this time no parties have answered the call for interest. ",
