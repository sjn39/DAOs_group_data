                    "content": "StableNode fully supports Endgame Plan and also advocates for lean and active governance. The Maker governance voted recently to reject certain budgets mostly on the reasoning that the governance would prefer to see such Core Units structure more inline with the Endgame plan. As we shared during the recent Delegate Office Hours, we respect the delegates\u2019 decisions, but believe that it\u2019s important to consider resource and clarity for Core Units that are interested in transitioning into Endgame. 1. Is the issue with the budget, mandate, or the structure? -One of the frustrations we heard from affected Core Units was uncertainty whether the reasoning for rejection indeed is due to the structure or more because of the budget details or mandate themselves. We believe such clear feedback to Core Units is important as they can better adjust their plans forward. 2. If it\u2019s the structure, resource is needed for the transition -Ranging from new proposals to re-organization to internal and external communication, the transition requires both time and assistance. And this should be fair for various participants and contributors (including Core Units) to the protocol. Having core units against the wall and asking them to adjust in a very short time (or else, their funding runs out) might end up doing more harm to the protocol than providing guidance and resources and reasonable time for them to transition. Therefore, for delegates and governance participants that believe funding requests and mandates are fair but the issue is with the structure, we encourage you to support needed funding and resources that such Core Units request to transition successfully.

                    "content": " Flip Flop Flap Delegate does not have all the right answers, but this is how we\u2019re thinking about it The gradual pivot to the Endgame Plan will be a testament for those that are here to see the DAO blossom and exceed beyond what it has already accomplished. It will separate those that are here strictly for the money, from those who will continue to push forward regardless of the possible monetary gains. The people who have that love and passion of helping MakerDAO reach the highest peak possible will stick around. The ones who were here for the money will move on. It will test the will of those who are willing to win, but don\u2019t have the willingness to prepare to win. Those that have the willingness to prepare to win regardless of obstacles, market conditions, and monetary benefits\u2013will be rewarded in a long-term game. We truly believe this.  Shape your Endgame Ecosystem future by taking the initiative rather than being a reactor We believe that if your Core Unit does not fit into the Endgame State and it needs to be oxidized from the Core (More than likely This is YOU if you\u2019re not PECU, RISK, Growth, or a CU deeply managing RWAs)  You need to take the initiative and start planning on how you as a team, or individually can contribute to this new paradigm\u2013either by becoming part of a cluster, or evolving as an ecosystem actor. Prepare and measure how and when your Core Unit can wind-down PLEASE understand that MAKERDAO IS NOT A CASH GRAB SPF and Project-based Funding will ONLY be supported by Flip Flop Flap Delegate, to those teams that are desperately needed to keep the DAO safe and operational. While Flip Flop Flap Delegate is a believer in owning a piece of the business, and not renting out your time, be sensible when it comes to MKR vesting request (repricing as well). Flip Flop Flap Delegate will only support up to 3 months as a \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d for volunteering to off-board your CU. Avoid some of the things that off-boarded CUs have made.Meaning; some MKR token owners and community members feel like the DAO was taken advantage by some of the previous off-boarded Core Units Hence, don\u2019t walk away with funds that don\u2019t belong to you\u2013don\u2019t be greedy\u2013you won\u2019t be welcomed back to the community by Flip Flop Flap Delegate and more than likely by some of the other Recognized Delegates.   Final Thoughts We are in a turbulent economic environment and having high personal financial expectations is more than likely not a practical approach. The world economy could end-up in a deep recession and the DAO will need to weather the storm. If this was a traditionalist corporate structure\u2013LAYOFFS would be imminent. Please understand this real-world concept. And last but not least, we can\u2019t help and stress that we must do better in helping stop making the community feel like MakerDAO is only a cash grab. Please, I kindly ask. Thank you. ",
