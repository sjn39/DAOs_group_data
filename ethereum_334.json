(like, not allowing other functions to tamper with previous stack?) was it just intended to keep the DUP and SWAP mechanic simple? (by not needing to deal with the N element of the stack) if DoS, could it get compensated by increasing gas costs?  DUPN: pops the passed N and pushes the nth element of the stack (Nth considered after consuming the N) [3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] => [13, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] SWAPN: pops the passed N and swaps the now first and nth element of the stack (Nth considered after consuming the N) [3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] => [13, 11, 12, 10, 14] N > 1023 reverts gas could be larger than their shorter counterparts, if there were any DoS concerns ",
