I wouldn\u2019t say no risk of losing principal \u2013 it depends upon the financial strength of your insurer and whether there are funds set aside by their governing jurisdiction to make whole policies that cannot be paid out by the insurer. It\u2019s also not tax free in the US, I believe. It\u2019s simply tax deferred. Just like appreciation of owning shares in an index that the insurance is based upon. Which of course is not without benefit, though! Perhaps this isn\u2019t the right place to ask this question, but are there any key persons that Maker needs to find a way to have life insurance on?

Insurance is just a thing where you have to keep an eye on your counterparty, which may or may not be onerous. As an aside, Roth IRAs are tax free. It\u2019s one of the few things besides insurance where you can put in post-tax dollars and receive tax-free benefits in the United States. Also, I\u2019m unclear how Maker could use insurance as an investment vehicle. Not to say it can\u2019t be done, but you don\u2019t want a surprise ruling from the IRS or other tax authority that says this wasn\u2019t ever actually functioning as insurance. It\u2019s a gray area, but you have to argue that it\u2019s actually being used at least mostly for insurance and not just as a tax shelter. I think for RWA, some form of call-like contracts being constantly sold towards the assets being collateralized may be a good option if there are interested counterpartys. If the collateral appreciates, there are unlikely to be a lot of liquidations with it, and if it depreciates, causing issues for DAI, the call-like contracts would be worthless and the funds could be used to intervene without needing to mint more MKR.

It\u2019s also exactly the kind of collateral that would be good to have since by what I\u2019ve seen, DAI is literally the least-correlated major crypto asset with regards to Ethereum. I don\u2019t think Ethereum will crash any time soon, but if it crashed, pretty much all the other collateral would as well. So more diversification via what you\u2019re saying would be wonderful.

I have a couple of questions: (1) Are you suggesting that Maker attempt to purchase (lend against) already existing policies that have been written to individuals? (2) If so, where would we source these policies? I assume they are quite scarce and inconsistent in terms of deal flow. If my above to points are heading in the right direction, I\u2019d like to reiterate a point I\u2019ve been making for a while: Maker should be the \u201clender\u2019s lender\u201d and originate loans to the originators themselves. So in an ideal world, Maker could provide a RLOC to an existing loan originator that specializes in IUL. This will allow for a high level of diversification, extra safety due to \u201cdouble equity\u201d in each deal, and a consistent deal flow that doesn\u2019t strain our own resources. ",

I was referring to a kind of structure like Centrifuge has with a loan originator, for instance, an insurance captive like CrescoFin is going to establish. I have contacted Robert Sharret the founder on discord and he too is interested in long-duration risk-free rates of return in order to build a DeFi yield curve. If someone like that with all of the infrastructure built and regulation above board launches such a platform, then MakerDAO could act as the source of funding either directly or through risk tranching like a collateralized loan obligation. There are trillions of dollars in liquidity tied up in insurance contracts that could be unlocked by MakerDAO/DeFi. I don\u2019t think deal flow would be an issue so long as the terms of the loan are competitive with the market. The banks can loan at Prime Rate so that is the benchmark to beat for the sake of taking on more risk in DeFi. Many wealthy individuals go to banks and do premium financing whereby the bank pays the premiums on the policy and when it has been fully funded (about 5 years) the loan is repaid by the growth in cash value. So maybe if it is a multi-million dollar deal MakerDAO could get into that niche market to make it worth the underwriting process. @mrabino1 would probably know best what the path forward for MakerDAO should be once RWA are up and running. I am just super excited by the possibilities that onboarding this collateral would bring.  Insurance Market735\u00d7398 31.6 KB  ",
