With the Maker Foundation dissolving, I\u2019ve had a chance to reflect on the future of the project. We have come incredibly far, and today the DAO is buzzing with an amazing amount of governance and protocol activity. But I believe that there is still a fundamental opportunity to rethink how we approach Maker Governance to make it even more vibrant, more focused, and more decentralized. To truly reach its potential, Maker needs to become a purpose-driven DAO. Most importantly, our decentralized community needs a compelling vision. One that is powerful enough to act as a north star, reducing distractions and aligning the community to focus on execution and results. At the same time, this vision must also appeal to non-crypto natives by showing the world the transformative potential of Maker and Decentralized Finance. From the very beginning, the goal of Maker has always been to use the power of blockchain technology to provide actual benefits to people and society. Our approach so far has been to focus directly on financial inclusion, and we\u2019ve already had success with Dai adoption in Argentina, and the Cambrian explosion of DeFi proving that there is a lot of demand for unfettered access to finance. Along the way we have also learned that Maker really excels as a backend infrastructure protocol, while also experiencing the limitations of how much a DAO can do to physically bridge the last mile and provide the kind of user experience that will actually result in direct, mass financial inclusion. As an example, today almost half of all Dai generated from ETH comes from just 5 vaults, and at least some of these 5 vaults are CeFi companies that offer regulated loans with a focus on UX and compliance to retail or institutional users. Similarly, the biggest and most scalable opportunities that exist in real world assets rely on extending large scale lines of credit to regulated institutions that can then funnel it into the broader economy. The recent governance proposal by Societe Generale - one of the world\u2019s largest banks - proves how Maker has the potential to impact the deepest layers of finance as a new financial backend. This realization of the role Maker is really beginning to play today leads us towards its true potential, not only as an end user focused DeFi protocol, but as a financial infrastructure that can help reshape other financial institutions that use it. From this position, Maker can help to fix the broken core of the global financial system itself and the bad incentives that\u2019s driving it towards its own demise.  Climate change and the collapse of industrial society Everyone knows climate change is bad - the harsh reality is making itself more apparent every day in the form of floods, wildfires and countless other disasters impacting people around the world. The IPCC has provided us irrefutable proof that business as usual can only last another 10 years, a message that has been shared over and over again by scientists around the world. The biggest problems are the climate tipping points that, once passed, will lock in irreversible and devastating changes through positive feedback loops\u2026 and we are almost there. One example is the melting permafrost, an event caused by global warming which then itself emits huge amounts of greenhouse gasses at an ever accelerating rate, comparable to an entire industrialized country.  2048\u00d71011 593 KB  There are many other similar phenomena: Wildfires, forest dieback and ice melt. All are devastating positive feedback loops that accelerate the trend of global warming and make it irreversible. In practice, to prevent it from becoming catastrophic and impossible to mitigate, humanity has to aggressively accelerate emissions reductions according to the graph below.  1852\u00d71042 189 KB  Sadly, the kind of globally coordinated and systemic change that is desperately needed simply isn\u2019t happening - despite all the natural disasters that should be raising the alarms in favor of climate action. Both China and the US - the world\u2019s largest emitters - are still accelerating fossil fuel use, and most of the developing world continues to fundamentally rely on expanding fossil fuel capacity to drive growth and help their people escape poverty. Society continues to debate the credibility of the threat of climate change and the global financial system is still prioritizing destructive short term gains - often with very negative ecological impact - over longer term, more sustainable profits. The reality is that the planet as we know it will dramatically and irreversibly change, and that change will have a very real economic and societal impact. What happens when huge swaths of agricultural land become barren or when billions of people are displaced because their homeland becomes inhospitable? It will cause unthinkable pressure on existing governments and force a dramatic shift in geopolitical power. This map helps paint a picture of how bad it will get if nothing is done.  1294\u00d71120 206 KB  Some more precise data:   Climate change tracking worst-case scenario - YouTube, which shows how we are currently tracking or exceeding the worst case scenario of emissions called \u201cRCP8.5\u201d, a model which was originally designed to be unrealistically bad and not something that could actually happen in reality  Climate change risks to push large parts of global food production and population centres to unprecedented conditions - NASA/ADS which shows that if we continue to track RCP 8.5 then 1/5th of all arable land will become unproductive, and 1/4th of all population centers will become uninhabitable, just in the next 50 years. Climate change is one of the most widely researched scientific topics. I encourage you to do more research yourself as there is an incredible amount of material being published on a daily basis.  Instead of treating climate change as the systemic threat and existential risk it is, when it first became apparent in the 80\u2019s, society\u2019s primary response has been to kick the can down the road, and even today most politicians will deflect the issue and point to \u201ctechnological solutions\u2019\u2019 that surely will appear due to human ingenuity and resilience to solve all of the issues. This silver bullet fantasy invites mass complacency about the fact that our economy and way of life will fundamentally change - No amount of innovation that can change the impact of the laws of thermodynamics over just a few decades. At this late stage, there remains only one option that can rise to meet this existential risk. We must harness the most powerful and ancient tool of our species: the power of money.  What can we do? What does Maker and DeFi have to do with climate change? At its core the climate problem is actually a financial and capital allocation problem. The root cause is the inability of the global economy to plan for anything other than the very short term and deal with the entrenched corruption that exists in its centralized and opaque infrastructure - that\u2019s why it allowed itself to reach world-destroying levels of pollution and continues to channel billions in capital towards it, despite the irrefutable fact that this will be its own undoing. DeFi exists to deal with exactly this type of problem. Bitcoin, which started the blockchain revolution, was created as a reaction to the 2007 financial crisis, a crisis that is very similar to the climate crisis - just on a much smaller scale. In both cases we are seeing the fundamental inability of the system to look beyond the very short term. The party must go on, and nobody has an incentive to care about what happens when the music stops. Transparency, stakeholder governance, carefully designed incentives, decentralization and the ability to turn future long term value into present day cash flows is what the world needs, and that\u2019s exactly what Maker, Dai and DeFi can deliver. By tapping into the fundamental features of blockchain we can develop verifiable processes to ensure all Maker collateral is in sustainable and climate-aligned assets that consider the long term impacts of financial activity on the environment. This will unlock Dai as the coordination tool the world desperately needs - a way for people and companies to band together to directly create a realistic impact right at the core of the issue. The crisis is so severe, and in such a late stage, that the global response needs to be nothing less than \u201ctotal war\u201d. Every aspect of the global economy, the business model of every company and the life of every individual will change, either proactively by working together to avert disaster, or involuntarily by inevitably suffering the consequences of inaction.  An old idea whose time has come  2048\u00d71356 392 KB  The Sustainable Finance principle which espouses backing Dai with sustainable and climate-aligned collateral, is a concept which was originally ratified by the Maker community as a part of the 5 Foundation Principles in the first ever Maker Governance vote in 2018. It\u2019s not a new concept, it\u2019s an old idea whose time has come. But it\u2019s not as simple as just making sure some of the RWA collateral is in Solar and Wind assets. To be serious about putting up a fight against the end of the world as we know it, the Maker community will have to truly adopt the principle of Sustainable Finance at the core of Maker\u2019s culture and entire collateral strategy. Climate change will have a greater impact on financial stability than anything else for at least the next 50 years. This time period, and especially the current decade, is also the critical window of opportunity where the outcome of the crisis will be determined. Having a focused collateral strategy provides significant benefits to Maker. One of the most obvious is reducing horizontal governance complexity and information overload by defining a specific, bounded scope. It also allows for a proactive approach where MKR holders decide what kind of risk they want exposure to. As a part of the Clean Money initiative I propose a collateral strategy based around a core portfolio with a trifecta of \u201cflagship collateral\u201d.  Sustainable collateral Maker and Dai can coordinate the global build-out of sustainable energy pathways by funneling billions of dollars into senior credit positions for projects that will build solar farms, wind turbines, batteries, recharging stations and other cost-efficient renewable energy solutions, as well as their supply chains, sustainable resource extraction and recycling. Renewable energy alone isn\u2019t enough to achieve a sustainable economy, but it is an area that Maker is well positioned to deal with, as it allows Maker Governance to build up specialized expertise for risk assessments within a well defined market that is commoditized and highly scalable. Today we already have everything we need to begin scaling our RWA exposure to hundreds of billions of USD and beyond, securely and in full compliance with financial regulation, by using the trustee-based model of real world assets that the community developed over many years, which was recently launched with 6s capital, and other projects on the way. A unique advantage that makes renewable energy and sustainable collateral a strong fit for Maker is that the positive externalities created for society can be indirectly capitalized by Maker in the form of social and political capital that reduces political uncertainty, if the proper steps are taken to support the endeavours with strong marketing and communications and also more exotic approaches like NFTs.  Resilient collateral Secondly, we need to ensure a big portion of the collateral behind Dai is provably resilient collateral that will resist the impacts of climate change. The positive perspective of why climate resilient collateral is critical for Makers future is the concept of so-called \u201cClimate Alpha\u201d. Most assets today are mispriced as climate risks are not factored in by our current capital markets because - repeating myself here - the system is unable to consider anything other than the very short term. Grasping climate alpha early is likely the largest economic opportunity that will exist over the next decades because of how bad things are getting - like discovering bitcoin in 2010 but at the macro level. No matter how much effort we, or anyone else, put into the cause of preventing catastrophic climate change, we need to prepare for a future of partial global collapse where many nations and entire regions we take for granted today will struggle as fertile lands get scarcer, extreme weather events wreak havoc, and social tensions keep growing. There is also a real possibility that these endless economic shocks will result in the hyperinflation of the USD and other world currencies. In such a situation it is vital that Dai is prepared with climate resilience, even if other currencies fail to do so, so that if the worst case scenario occurs, Dai can stand alone and fulfill its potential of becoming a free-floating currency. This kind of resilience can be achieved by broadly diversifying the bulk of our long term RWA collateral into the countries that are climate resilient and socio-politically stable. These places will become humanity\u2019s strongholds against the effects of climate change, and will provide Dai with the strength it needs to survive on its own even as other financial dominoes start to fall. Channeling capital to the climate resilient countries is also important because they urgently need to be developed to have the food production, shelter and jobs available to accommodate the climate refugees that will immigrate there over the course of this century, especially if climate change is not well mitigated. There is a serendipitous overlap between the few climate resilient countries that exist, and the few geopolitically independent countries that have political systems fit for housing large amounts of DeFi collateral with minimal regulatory risk. The countries where these two categories overlap can be considered \u201cSuper Countries\u201d, and they should provide the bulk of the real world asset exposure of Dai. Examples of what I would consider Super Countries are: New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  Decentralized collateral Finally we need to double down on our roots of decentralized collateral, in particular solidify our fundamental commitment to and reliance on Ethereum and the ETH token. The Ethereum blockchain is built for human coordination and resilience. As the world is forced to deal with the impacts of climate change, Ethereum will enable financial markets to coordinate on mitigation, and it will continue to function even during large-scale disasters. Importantly, once the upgrade from proof of work to proof of stake is completed, Ethereum will become a highly energy efficient blockchain, and ETH will become a sustainable contender to Bitcoin\u2019s current role as the primary cryptocurrency. The Maker collateral strategy should prioritize accumulating more ETH as collateral across various combinations of risk parameters, and accumulate more collateral derived from ETH, such as LP tokens or ETH collateralized assets. Holding ETH directly as protocol reserves can be also considered as strong method for Maker to both directly support, and directly benefit from its ecosystem. It is likely there will be a long term transition towards using staked ETH in DeFi, and Maker should spearhead this to prevent it from creating an opening for others to capture ETH collateral from Maker. Since staked ETH needs third party solutions to be usable in DeFi, it is critical that Maker ensures that adoption of staked ETH in DeFi doesn\u2019t compromise the decentralization and security of the network. Another avenue is to rely on the broader DeFi ecosystem to generate Dai backed by decentralized collateral using Direct Deposit Modules into platforms like Aave, Compound and Yearn, which can generate high yield with moderate risk, and can help improve the market position and availability of Dai in the DeFi ecosystem.  Stablecoins are what they eat A Dai stablecoin backed by sustainable and climate resilient collateral is one with a powerful climate aligned brand. In a world that\u2019s critically challenged by the climate crisis, demand for Dai will grow in line with the growing success and relevance of its collateral. The climate crisis is beginning to have a profound impact on people\u2019s identity and personal lives - in particular the youngest generations - as exemplified by this recent study showing that more than half of young people believe humanity is doomed 56 Percent of Young People Think Humanity Is Doomed  Would you rather use Clean Money or Black Box Money? With Dai operating as a Decentralized, Sustainable, Resilient stablecoin, backed by assets that serve each of these purposes, we can honestly and confidently call Dai \u201cClean Money.\u201d  Clean because it\u2019s playing its part in saving the planet from pollution and negative externalities with sustainable collateral. Clean because it transparently adapts to long term impacts to its stability from climate change and global instability with decentralized and resilient collateral. Clean because its governance and operational infrastructure operates fully in public.  If Maker can realistically deal with the most relevant issue in the present day, we can catalyze a new era of mainstream awareness of DeFi and blockchain and the positive benefits they provide society as coordination tools, while also drawing attention to the problems with the current model of black box finance and money. The monetary and financial system of aggressive short term growth is at the core of why the climate crisis exists in the first place, and to this day the Federal Reserve\u2019s and the European Central Bank\u2019s Quantitative Easing programs do not perform strict Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) screening, so they are actively funneling unfathomable sums of the public\u2019s money directly towards fossil fuel projects that are eroding their economies. By showing easily digestible evidence to the world such as pictures of actual wind turbines built with funding from Dai users, and accompanying it with scientific reports of impact data, we can prove to people that there\u2019s finally a realistic option for climate action where individuals can help tip the scales at the core of the problem. The more capital we allocate towards sustainable activities while supporting it with large-scale, high quality marketing and PR activities, the more positive climate impact our projects can have. Verified results will strengthen our brand, leading to more powerful adoption funnels and cheaper cost of capital. This then enables an ever increasing amount of impactful investments, feeding a virtuous cycle of hypergrowth. Additionally, the mainstream awareness and relevance of Makers climate impacts also manifests itself as political resilience. If Maker can deliver undeniable real world benefits, regulatory risks in countries with climate on the political agenda will be much less likely.  The supporting collateral I already mentioned the three categories of flagship collateral, but there\u2019s also two additional categories of supporting collateral to consider.  Backbone collateral The first is the Backbone collateral. This category is extremely important as it provides the backbone of Dai stability, in particular in situations where there is a massive influx of Dai demand. The Backbone collateral works by having RWA infrastructure that can absorb very large amounts of capital into safe, productive and climate aligned assets. The perfect vehicles for this are corporate bonds of top rated ESG corporations held in trusts protected by world class trustees located in the Super Countries. They pay good yields, they strengthen the Clean Money vision, they are safe, they can be held in politically safe jurisdictions, and they can be relatively liquid. Maker will need to review the different ESG frameworks to determine which frameworks are genuine, and which are just greenwashing, and then throw its weight behind supporting and improving the genuine ESG standards - if Dai grows large enough then this could have a real, positive impact on the ESG ratings ecosystem.  Liquidity collateral In addition to the Backbone collateral we also need Liquidity collateral, which mainly takes the form of popular centralized stablecoins. To make it impossible to single out Maker for blacklisting, we can hold most of them with a \u201cDeFi shield\u201d, such as deposits to Aave and Compound - this way we will also earn yield on them. Another potential source of Liquidity collateral is liquid, safe and flexible exposure to global financial institutions and banks. The recent tokenized bond experiment by Societe Generale shows how banks may be willing to provide Maker with this kind of exposure. Diversified exposure directly to institutions can be a useful counterbalance to centralized stablecoin exposure, and could reduce US exposure. Dai will need a huge amount of readily available stablecoins to ensure confidence in the peg cannot be broken, at least 100s of millions, and more as the total outstanding Dai grows. To increase the growth of Dai, and to make it possible to properly compete with centralized stablecoins, the spread on the PSMs should be reduced to 0 so that Dai becomes a proper stablecoin with no problematic UX friction. The lost income from not charging a spread is made up for by returns generated by the Backbone collateral.  A decisive solution to the USDC exposure My estimate is that if we align on the course of action now, within a year we can allocate 3 billion or more of our USDC exposure into ESG corporate bonds protected by a world class trustee in the UK or another Super Country. We would also be able to implement DeFi shielding on the remaining stablecoins in the PSM - together these measures remove almost all of our US exposure. This will be a tremendous achievement, but is actually relatively easy to execute given everything Maker Governance has accomplished and grown into today. We will then have achieved a massive sustainability transformation where billions were channeled into ESG assets, while the protocol will start to earn a good yield enabling the restart of the DSR to begin the hypergrowth phase, and we will have diversified exposure out of the United States which currently has an unpredictable environment for DeFi, and removed the ability to specifically target Maker with stablecoin blacklists. In my opinion, the main type of exposure we should have to the US while the political climate is still uncertain is sustainable collateral flagship projects which help showcase the benefits DeFi can provide.  Unleashing the DeFi Superpowers With this comprehensive plan, we give Maker a purpose that matters. By making Maker a tool for global climate action, with much increased decentralization and resilience, we create momentum, focus and an opportunity for hypergrowth of both Dai and MKR adoption. Let\u2019s be real. For this to have the impact the world desperately needs it to have, it needs to be made very profitable to participate. We need to align the public benefit of allocating capital towards sustainability and developing resilience, with the individual motives that drive capital markets. Conventionally this has been considered impossible. You either save the whales kumbaya style as a nonprofit and eventually fizzle out, or you reap your profits through ruthless capitalism by burning the earth. But in the world we live in today, it IS possible to align the long term value of society with the short term value of individuals, by turning to the DeFi \u201csuperpowers\u201d that have been recently innovated, including tokenomics, yield farming, token issuance, and NFTs. These are all economic mechanisms that make it possible to take abstract value that exists far out in the future, given the positive outcome of a coordination problem, and turn it into hard cash flows today. How to practically implement this forms a core part of the Clean Money initiative.  The Sagittarius Engine  1200\u00d7800 195 KB The latest wave in DeFi has been driven by creative use of advanced tokenomics and economic flows that fuel it. The central element I propose for Maker to make the Clean Money initiative possible and highly valuable is a tokenomics system called the Sagittarius Engine. This system would mostly replace buy and burn as the destination of protocol surplus, and significantly innovate on the value model of MKR, drawing from the experiences learned in the DeFi ecosystem over the course of DeFi summer and the ensuing boom in advanced tokenomics.  Edit: based on the feedback I\u2019ve received I\u2019m currently designing a Sagittarius Engine V2 that provides simpler staking options - such as just receiving a streaming income of MKR to those who lock up their MKR. The below text describes the first version which was focused on providing cheap credit to MKR holders. The main value proposition of the Sagittarius Engine is that it gives a tangible benefit to MKR holders who lock up their MKR into governance for long term periods. The primary incentive to do this is the ability to borrow from the pool of Dai accumulated from protocol surplus in the Sagittarius Engine, using the locked up MKR as collateral. This borrowing opportunity would be is at an extremely attractive rate (equal to the DSR) and with very lenient liquidation terms (grace period of at least 1 week). The Dai borrowed with MKR collateral will not cause a buildup of tail risk in the system, because it is \u201cnormal\u201d Dai that has been generated through standard collateral, and is only lent out by the Sagittarius Engine after the protocol has earned it as surplus. The name Sagittarius comes from the location of the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, which holds the entire galaxy together, keeping it in a stable equilibrium. The engine is designed to create a similar effect of a \u201ccapital black hole\u201d that sits at the center of MakerDAO and holds it together in powerfully aligned equilibrium. The main mechanism for this is to provide an extremely strong voting and participation incentive through directly funnelling benefits to active community members that put skin in the game. At the same time the model doesn\u2019t leak capital, meaning that once capital crosses the \u201cevent horizon\u201d and is funneled into the Sagittarius Engine, it can only grow over time, even though Sagittarius users get to directly benefit from it at the same time. This has some extremely powerful long term effects that means that once it hits a large enough size, it will forever continue to attract large amounts of MKR that will be locked up for very long periods of time. To complete the circle, and truly supercharge the potential of the Sagittarius Engine, we need to execute large scale MKR token issuance. MKR issuance is already happening today with Core Unit MKR vesting modules that directly issue new MKR to pay bonuses. I think we have an opportunity to both tap into the power of large scale MKR issuance to drive growth of the protocol and benefit MKR holders, in the same way newer DeFi protocols have been doing since DeFi summer, while also then close the door on potential infinite issuance by setting a new upper bound at 3 million MKR that prevents Core Units from issuing new MKR, but instead directing them to tap into the protocol treasury for any MKR expenses. The issuance schedule should happen over the next 50 years, strengthening and working together with the Clean Money vision by providing the fuel necessary for Maker to become a global force for climate action. By providing a long timeline that corresponds to the purpose of the project we can engineer an Ice Age, a concept which means a period of time where governance can be less random and focus more on patient execution of a long term, reliable plan, rather than new creative proposals and pivots. The Ice Age concept will be described further below. To further improve the positive benefits the Sagittarius Engine can have on Maker Governance, locked up MKR has a voting power multiplier of around 2x (although this needs to be carefully debated in the community). This means that voters who are willing to commit to the long term success of the protocol, and put more skin in the game, will have a greater say - this way a smaller holder that is more committed than a larger whale could still potentially still have more effective votes and more influence. Combined with the issuance of large amounts of new MKR, the Sagittarius Engine has the potential to usher in a new era where Maker Governance will see a significant influx of new blood by allowing a huge amount of new small and medium sized holders to enter the ecosystem and have a big say in future decisions as the project executes on the Clean Money vision.  Incentivizing the reduction of MKR in circulation through MKR issuance The new MKR that we issue with the Sagittarius Engine should be distributed in various ways, including directly putting it on dutch auctions, as well as distributing to users of decentralized collateral types via yield farming-like programs that result in MKR being distributed across the market and an influx of cash to the Maker Protocol. This cash then gets funneled into the Sagittarius Engine\u2019s capital pool, to enable more MKR-collateralized low-cost borrowing. This will then drive demand to lock up most of the newly issued MKR, plus significant amounts of the MKR that is in the market today. Because the net effect will likely be less MKR on the market overall in the short term, Maker Governance will have the ability to tap into this cash flow and divert a part of it towards Core Units and other expenses, such as building up long term reserves that allows for more ambitious capital deployment strategies that can make the difference when it comes to having an impact on climate change.  Impact NFTs: a new sustainable primitive for artists In order to try to directly tie the tokenomics together with the vision, and to enable MKR holders to capture value from the positive externalities they fund, the Sagittarius Engine will have an NFT component based on the concept of Impact NFTs. The basic idea is that each vision-aligned success story the DAO achieves is saved in an NFT and then distributed to Sagittarius users in a token-weighted lottery. Specifically this would mean tokenizing the \u201cstatus signal\u201d component of each wind turbine, each block of Solar capacity, each battery unit and other sustainable flagship collateral projects, and these NFTs would then have social value to the extent society values those who contribute towards the public good. These NFTs could use the Maker Oracle network to have live statistics about the scale of the impact, such as how much clean energy has been generated, how much carbon has been offset - in some cases with creative interpretations such as displaying the equivalent number and size of trees grown, and other innovative ways to try to make the social impact and positive externality created more tangible and relatable. The DAO can use a modest budget to fund up and coming NFT artists and developers to develop artwork and gamification features in these NFT\u2019s that enhance their value, and add to the uniqueness and historical significance of the underlying flagship collateral projects and their climate impacts. Over time many different approaches can be tried out, all with the common element that the NFTs are tied to an actual real world climate impact. The more value the Impact NFTs have, the more they help the cause of climate action by drawing more MKR into the Sagittarius Engine to participate in the lottery. Additionally having a \u201croyalty fee\u201d on trades of the impact NFTs would mean if they are traded, a part of the price can be funneled towards charity projects like mangrove reforestation - that themselves can then be used to create rare and exclusive impact NFTs. In addition to just creating impact NFTs with relevant artwork and statistics, there are also some more advanced trends that exist today that Maker could adopt. Currently there are at least two staple \u201cprimitives\u201d that have emerged in NFTs, that both may be relevant to adopt and provide a climate impact spin:  Generative profile pictures like cryptopunks which aim to incubate social media communities. Gaming primitives like the Loot project that build a basic building block and then count on others building on top of it to continuously increase the dimensions of gamification as long as there is an engaged user base.  Over time more trends like this may emerge and Maker could continuously aim to adopt those that are a good fit for the impact NFTs. Most art is inspired by and closely tied to nature and our physical world. Enticing others to collaborate with and build on top of the impact NFTs could help catalyze a lot of new artwork and give artists a way to make their creations have a direct positive impact on the fight for climate change.  By MKR holders, for MKR holders With a powerful vision that resonates with what the people of the world need, and increasingly want, combined with equally powerful tokenomics and crypto superpowers to support it, everything is in place for Maker to grow at light speed over the next decades. Almost. There\u2019s a final crucial piece of the puzzle that needs to be just as strong as the vision and the tokenomics: the internal bureaucratic structure that executes and regulates all of the mechanisms, and continuously adapts to the new world during and after the hypergrowth phase. Only by credibly being able to handle such large scale growth and importance in the global economy, will it ever be possible for Maker to get the public to buy in to the vision of Clean Money, and thus tap into the future value of the vision in order to drive growth in the short run and kickstart the process over the next years. We need to evolve the Maker governance process, culture and political dynamic to be extremely decentralized and efficient even at massive levels of growth and over very long time periods, with high levels of churn and changing environments. We also need the Maker Governance process to be fundamentally MKR holders first, and this way encourage much greater levels of grassroots activity from MKR holders than what is seen today. MKR holders hold the power to vote and are the final guardians of the integrity of the protocol, but that only works if they are also empowered and informed adequately to act as the backbone of the decentralized community. The Sagittarius Engine will already go a long way to achieve this, but the rules, frameworks, and bureaucracy of Maker Governance have to also be fundamentally designed from this perspective. Maker Governance must evolve to become by MKR holders, for MKR holders.  850\u00d7478 63.4 KB  If we\u2019re able to align the success of the vision of Clean Money, and the public good that it can create, with the self-interest of MKR voters, then it will be possible to maintain a stable and self-regulating governance equilibrium that is ultimately enforced and driven by individual self interest of MKR holders - in particular those locked up in the Sagittarius Engine.  The Age of Sagittarius: The next Generation of Maker Governance A \u201cGovernance Earthquake\u201d is a situation where a community does not have norms, rules or processes of either a high enough quantity or quality to deal with its external environment, and as a result it leaves a void that enables a high rate of new proposals that are likely to pass and change the status quo. The high rate of new proposals then itself normalizes rapid change as well as a critical view of anything established - meaning rapid change in one area of governance can result in rapid change across all areas of governance. A \u201cgovernance ice age\u201d is the opposite, it is a situation where the quality and quantity of governance frameworks is enough that \u201call bases are well covered\u201d, meaning for any given situation there are already norms and rules that handle them well. In such a situation, there\u2019s rarely a need for new ground breaking proposals, and when they\u2019re made they are heavily scrutinized and changes to the status quo are done slowly and carefully to ensure it causes minimal disruptions. This then normalizes and reinforces minimal change, creating an environment where proposals are rarely made and almost always rejected. The concept of a Governance Ice Age can be roughly compared to the concept of \u201cGovernance Lockdown\u201d that exists in other, simpler DeFi protocols. But instead of focusing on a technical lockdown, which is impossible in Maker due to its complexity, the focus is on a political and bureaucratic lockdown. Having governance ice age based on norms and rules that are well made, and that are still relevant to the external reality is incredibly beneficial, because it brings the stability that an economy and business environment needs in order to attract large scale development and investment. Since a governance ice age should always eventually lose relevance on a long enough timescale, it is natural that there will be long periods of ice ages until the external reality has changed enough, broken by short governance earthquakes that adjust to the new reality and trigger the conditions for a new ice age. In Maker this dynamic is not yet well developed, and we have been in a drawn out earthquake since the Foundation started dissolving. However I don\u2019t think there is a clear path towards an Ice Age yet. The original MIP framework tried to somewhat plan for how to achieve an Ice Age with MIP1, which spells out various areas that should be covered by MIPs, and then once that has been done, the MIP process would become more strict and slow, but it was too early in trying to predict what Maker Governance would need to function, and was forgotten. The biggest issue in Maker governance today is the domination of the Core Units and lack of transparency standards, which has fueled a general perception by the broader and less informed MKR holder community (e.g. what you\u2019d find on reddit, twitter, or regional social media) that the Core Units are inefficient and even corrupt. This is of course wrong, the vast majority of people working in the Core Units are among the top professionals in the space, and they have already delivered huge amounts of value. However, none of that matters if MKR holders don\u2019t see the value, and feel frustrated and left out of the process. Despite the shortfalls and negative perceptions, it is a miracle that the Core Units were able to grow to the size they are today and take over and run the protocol well, providing an incredibly strong foundation for the next step in the evolution of the Maker Governance bureaucracy. It is time to take the next logical step, and move the center of gravity back into the hands of MKR holders by deliberately designing a governance Ice Age: the Age of Sagittarius, that can act as a north star for the next 50 years as MakerDAO grapples with the climate emergency and undergoes hypergrowth. I\u2019m suggesting the Governance Ice Age is named after the tokenomics engine that will be boosted by MKR issuance for its duration, as I believe tokenomics are the strongest possible force in a DAO. By clearly aligning tokenomics and governance mechanisms we have the best possible conditions for a stable equilibrium.  Crafting a political and bureaucratic equilibrium The Age of Sagittarius fundamentally means putting the internal structures in place that will support the external vision of Clean Money, with a bureaucracy and political dynamic that is resilient enough to overcome all challenges and credibly produce an environment of long term stability, while still having the necessary flexibility to adapt to changes or unforeseen events as they happen over the next decades. I propose to craft this new reality by starting from the governance politics perspective, by having MKR holders and delegates self-organize to create groups in a decentralized, transparent and politically powerful structure that I call Decentralized Voter Committees (DVC). The DVCs would be permissionless in that anyone can create them, and there\u2019s no strict definition of where the line is drawn on what counts and doesn\u2019t count as an \u201cofficial DVC\u201d, but generally follow guidelines that ensure they maximize their potential for having an impact and working on behalf of MKR holders interest  Keeping all critical communication and decision making fully transparent in open calls that can be joined and observed by anyone Proving the amount of voting power they have available to make it possible to assess how serious a committee should be taken and to what extent they can actually sway votes Be self administered through an internal, independent decision making process Focus on particular areas of expertise or interest that they can reasonably analyze and comprehend at levels approaching the Core Units Receive no compensation and have no direct special privileges in the governance process beyond their interests as MKR holders. The Sagittarius Engine should help with bridging the gap by providing a strong incentive for MKR holders that have a long term lockup to actively participate in governance to protect their locked MKR. Take a separation of powers approach as counterparties of Core Units and Private Actors in the ecosystem, recognizing that these groups, while working for or with the DAO, ultimately have different interests and incentives than MKR holders and that needs to be kept in check Excluding Mandated Actors, or Private Actors that receive funding through Core Unit Budgets or make money from governance access like collateral onboarding in order to keep the decentralized Voting Committees focused on considering MKR holders interests Interact with Mandated Actors and Private Actors in formal settings by inviting them to join calls in order to get them to share information, provide input or recommendations, with full transparency while being mindful of separation of powers. Monitoring and publishing information about the political and power dynamic of Maker Governance Monitor the performance, track record and potential for retention or churn of facilitators and consider potential replacements Generate governance recommendations and MIPs Generate opinions about existing MIPs Generate opinions about facilitator proposals and Core Unit budget proposals Analyze and publish information about positive and negative accomplishments in different layers of the Core Units and governance process  With Decentralized Voter Committees in place, it will then be possible to begin work on fundamental frameworks that can create the Age of Sagittarius. I plan to personally be directly involved in DVCs for at least a year, which the amount of time I believe it will take to finish the Governance Earthquake Phase, and then as we begin to enter a Governance Ice Age I will pull out of deep involvement in Maker Governance after helping to incubate DVCs that can then become a force for keeping the eyes on the goal and ensuring the different layers of the bureaucracy function as they\u2019re supposed to in the Ice Age, and ultimately take action if they don\u2019t. At the highest level is the World Map. The World Map is a concept of having all processes, rules, norms, requirements, frameworks etc listed in a single place that covers everything Maker Governance needs, end to end, to function and operate within the scope of Age of Sagittarius Ice Age to deliver on the vision of Clean Money and provide a stable framework for the next 50 years. Another critical decision that has to be made is to establish a bounded scope of future major technical innovation that will be added to the Maker Protocol, so that technical work can begin to focus primarily on upgrading and deploying existing innovations rather than inventing new ones. One of the most important aspects of designing a Maker Governance that is \u201cby MKR holders, for MKR holders\u201d will be to get the Core Unit bureaucracy under control, by enforcing very high levels of transparency of those who hold significant trust and power vested in them by Maker Governance. This can be achieved by comprehensive frameworks like a Separation of Powers framework that ensure decentralization of the layers of the governance process and a Decision Impact Assessment framework that can standardize the level of detail required of KPI and prioritization processes and related disclosures for Mandated Actors. Both of these mentioned frameworks are concepts that I believe the community needs to publicly discuss and adopt versions of. To do this in a way that wouldn\u2019t disrupt all the good work that\u2019s being currently done, it would require both an increase in the overall budgets available to Core Units, and the creation of new types of governance infrastructure, including empowering delegates to professionalize with competitive salaries and budgets, and creating \u201cmeta-Core Units\u201d whose role are to professionally support and analyze other Core Units to help bridge the gap between governance and the work being done on the ground by for instance, reporting and providing data to DVCs and directly to the community on the forum or social media. All of this will require a lot more resources than is being used today, but it would also result in higher overall efficiency, for a net effect of significantly more value generated. A strong vision that can inspire community members and market participants to engage with the project, and powerful tokenomics that can help turn this into reliable cash flows will make it possible to increase budgets in the short run to complete the circle by then providing resources necessary to evolve the governance infrastructure and create exponential growth and returns, delivering on the vision with concrete results in the real world. This will be a self fulfilling prophecy if the community believes something this ambitious is actually a realistic next stop from what we have today, and can align around taking decisive action. Ultimately it is only possible to create a reliable and stable Ice Age that provides the conditions for awareness-driven hypergrowth if the entire community of MKR holders comes together to discuss and decide on the optimal solutions given the knowledge we have available today, and then commit to it.

I completely agree a sustainble, resilient, decentralized, fully transparent model is required to drive a new and better future for everyone.   This includes not just building the financial models, and making hard choice commitments, but also building on strengths of new transformative ideas and ideals.  These have to have a strong focus on community and relationship building with partners who share the same goals and views with a strong commitment towards achieving them together. Everyone is a stakeholder in the future of planet earth and all that lives here. It will probably take me a few weeks to months to formulate a reply and honestly I am going to have to take a few hours to sit and read and make notes before I even formulate one. One thing I am going to post here because I felt it was relevant was my reaction to building solar farms on greenfields.   There are so many brownfields and building top areas that could be converted it isn\u2019t funny and a complete disregard for a well thought out and well presented Solar Grand Plan now what 12+ years ago in Scientific American still mostly ignored by politicians in the US.   We spent Trillions to just pay people to survive Covid - we can\u2019t find $1T to execute this solar grand plan.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       Poll votes:  Flash loan fee to 0 - yes.  Solar x Proposal - no.  I want to be clear.  I want to see more solar proposals, but ideally these should be brownfield developments not greenfield ones, or converting roofs of large building complexes in cities, where ever.   Also I would like to see these more concentrated in the southwest.  I welcome the proposer to bring more projects but would encourage them to have some skin in the game.   The land owner being \u2018part of the project\u2019 just means everyo\u2026     Which led me to ask the DAO whether we should apply suitability metrics to projects poll which got virtually no traction (even though 10 people were a unanimous yes).     Informal Poll - MakerDAO Project Partnership Suitability Metrics? Community Development       While going over proposals, doing further research, I encountered an issue around sustainability and whether this should even be taken into account when looking at projects or partnerships.  In my own delegate platform I have two key Core Values that I emphasize.    Stakeholder recognition - micro to macrocosm  Secure, Sustainable and Scalable Systems.  These Core Values apply to everything.  Is what I am doing sustainable, scalable, and not just good for myself, or my community, but the world i\u2026     I wanted to thank you for taking the significant effort to put the above post together and I hope everyone will take the time to read and comment to the thoughtful input presented.

                    "content": "    rune:  My estimate is that if we align on the course of action now, within a year we can allocate 3 billion or more of our USDC exposure into ESG corporate bonds protected by a world class trustee in the UK or another Super Country. We would also be able to implement DeFi shielding on the remaining stablecoins in the PSM - together these measures remove almost all of our US exposure. This will be a tremendous achievement, but is actually relatively easy to execute given everything Maker Governance has accomplished and grown into today.   Is the idea to get these corporate bonds tokenized on-chain and then have them collateralize them DAI via vaults and PSMs , or take some unused USDC from the PSM, and place it in these bonds held by trustees on behalf of MakerDao?

The Sagittarius would be a place where DAI earned in stability fees would go once Maker has paid all its operational expenses. Once there, MKR holders could stake MKR and borrow DAI against their MKR at a low interest rate. Plus they would get double votes in governance. Meanwhile, MakerDAO would deploy Curve-like MKR yield farming, where people are rewarded for making vaults in the vaults where the DAO most wants capital. MKR would be used to drive growth in key vault areas. Those new vaults would drive more stability fees, which would mean more DAI going into the Sagittarius Engine. As more DAI is in the engine, more people will want to stake MKR to borrow there, growing the long termism within MakerDAO. Is that basically right, @rune? Do I get it? ",

Now my favorite crypto project is jumping on the bandwagon and deciding that we have to fight alleged climate change.

What I\u2019d like to offer as a response here is first on the \u201cnot my problem\u201d question, i.e. should private businesses like Maker be involved in climate change? Shouldn\u2019t we just focus on ourselves and what\u2019s good for us? from the initial wall of text:  The crisis is so severe, and in such a late stage, that the global response needs to be nothing less than \u201ctotal war\u201d. Every aspect of the global economy, the business model of every company and the life of every individual will change, either proactively by working together to avert disaster, or involuntarily by inevitably suffering the consequences of inaction.  Basically, you may not want to deal with climate change\u2026 but then you are just resigning yourself to destruction, because we are won\u2019t be saved unless there is collective, systemic change. It\u2019s unfortunately not a joke or a gimmick, either everything changes voluntarily, or we get something akin to the late bronze age collapse, likely within our lifetime. Here\u2019s an hour long lecture on the subject. TL;DR: Mass migration due to natural disasters can cause cascading collapse of advanced interconnected economies 1177 B.C.: When Civilization Collapsed | Eric Cline - YouTube And unfortunately central banks aren\u2019t even doing what they should when it comes to climate action - they don\u2019t do strict ESG screening on QE, meaning they are inadvertently pumping billions into polluting economic activity that\u2019s now beginning to backfire by causing costly disasters in their economies. And don\u2019t forget that the disasters we are seeing now are absolutely nothing compared to what\u2019s already locked in (but won\u2019t show up for another 30 years because of the climate lag), and what will be further locked in over the next decade. Now the second point I want to address:  Simple version is, how about instead of doing all this we just burn maker tokens?  My argument is that this is exactly what this is all about. This is in my personal opinion the strongest move we can make towards reducing the amount of MKR that is in circulation. A strong direction that we can collective execute towards that accomplishes just that. The first caveat is of course that I\u2019m equating long term token lockup to burn, which is the point of the Sagittarius Engine. It\u2019s an approach to taking MKR out of circulation that can have a much stronger and much more immediate effect than old school buy and burn, and in the process also works to recruit a new generation of active governance participants and project supporters that are motivated by the economic incentives of participating, but also getting motivation from a vision that goes beyond just money. You don\u2019t have to choose between doing good and making money - you can choose to do both and get more of both! That\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting, in particular when it comes to the collateral strategy. We can use the simple direction of Clean Money to converge on decisive solutions to a number of really important tasks that are all about growing, expanding and increasing the value of the project both in short and long term:   Derisk USDC exposure: We can deal with this by allocating the assets into corporate bonds with an ESG component. Why not just put the money into regular corporate bonds? Arguably, ESG bonds have a political advantage if it\u2019s done in countries with a strong climate agenda. Political leaders that are struggling to square the round hole when it comes to emissions reductions will be less inclined to crack down on a project and movement that is genuinely supporting them. This kind of political defense cannot be measured in money, but considering how the USDC exposure and concerns about blacklist or seizure, I think we can consider any kind of political protection very valuable.  Increase ETH collateral: everyone loves ETH, so getting more ETH as collateral that we can charge fees on is not very controversial I think. We can achieve this with yield farming, and the Sagittarius Engine allows us to both issue MKR to power the yield farming, while actually having the net effect of reducing circulating MKR, especially in the short term.  Get high quality RWA exposure in safe jurisdictions: This is where the \u201cSuper Countries\u201d come in. There are certain places in the world where real world assets are just significantly safer and better for DeFi. Places like the UK or New Zealand where people care about climate change and being considered climate-aligned gives political clout. Meanwhile these places are also among the most climate resilient countries in the world: New Zealand rated best place to survive global societal collapse | Globalisation | The Guardian and that means we are tapping into Climate Alpha - the one thing that\u2019s going to absolutely dominate finance in the future.  Begin professional marketing: Maker has never really been able to market itself much because the Foundation would be exposed to too many risks by doing so. Now that Maker is decentralized, it will be possible to do a lot more aggressive marketing activities, especially in the areas where we also have political clout. Clean Money and green branding that goes beyond the greenwashing most other products have to offer is a way to differentiate crypto against tradfi in a way that appeals to regular people that aren\u2019t necessarily money crazy and aren\u2019t being attracted to all the bells and whistles that the rest of DeFi has to offer.  Streamline and upgrade the governance bureaucracy: Maker Governance has a very complex and interconnected bureaucracy today, that is unfortunately very opaque. The DAO as a whole needs to maintain a high level of idealism if we want to have any chance of maintaining a large decentralized bureaucratic apparatus that doesn\u2019t just corrupt over time because it is run by people whose only motivation is money. If we can truly create a movement that is about working together for a goal that goes beyond just making money for oneself (though importantly, also includes making money!), then we have a real chance to tap into the power of DAOs as a way to scale and parallelize work beyond what a centralized organization ever could.

Significance For all of us there comes a moment in each of our lives where economic success gets put on the \u201cback burner\u201d in favor of significance (usually as you have already made some money in life). The longer you work (crypto or other) the more you see it and feel it. We all want to make this world better than we found it and have it more positively impact our children than our own experiences / struggles. Initiatives and vision like @rune sets forth, represent a challenge that the community should embrace. This is not 18 months of work, nor 18 years. This is a perspective that spans decades / generations / even centuries. It is a mission\u2026 a duty. When you mix economic success with significance, it should have everyone\u2019s attention.  Challenge Accepted 6s Capital is happy to answer the call and will add new collateral sectors to its commercial lending line-up. Further as outlined in this post, I stressed the need (and my personal desire) for other community-led commercial lenders to join 6s. I echo that same message today. We need more LendCOs (and we need them all over the planet) ! The foregoing notwithstanding, our ethos and mission may be the environment around us, we must still \"Crawl. Walk. Run. \" We must do so in an aggressive yet prudent manner. The only thing worse than no action would be willfully putting on the blinders (with regard to safety) in the name of a great cause only to drive off a cliff by not including the institutional safeguards available. With the addition of broadly defined renewable / sustainable / resilient collateral, 6s Capital looks forward to applying for & working with the community to tackle this challenge head-on. That said, 6s does not take this initiative lightly. I view this not only as a mission but rather a great privilege and responsibility to ensure this is done safely for MKR holders / for 6s\u2019 investors / for 6s\u2019 staff /  for 6s\u2019 borrowers / for the world we live in. This challenge is as great as one can dream. It is a challenge that we can individually and collectively take pride in. What will your contribution be? I am in. Let\u2019s roll !! ",

                    "content": "    rune:  The first caveat is of course that I\u2019m equating long term token lockup to burn, which is the point of the Sagittarius Engine. It\u2019s an approach to taking MKR out of circulation that can have a much stronger and much more immediate effect than old school buy and burn, and in the process also works to recruit a new generation of active governance participants and project supporters that are motivated by the economic incentives of participating, but also getting motivation from a vision that goes beyond just money.   I\u2019m all about the social impact, but the thing that will make this effective is by aligning social good with self-interest. So, question: Burning MKR reduces the total number of tokens in existence, and therefore increases the proportion of profits, assets, and governance power that each remaining MKR controls. This increases the value of each MKR token in a straightforward way, and is a big part of why MKR holders have historically liked MKR. Incentivizing people to lock their MKR within the Sagittarius Engine with low-cost collateralized loans doesn\u2019t do the above, even though you can argue that it \u201ctakes it out of circulation\u201d. The total number of tokens is the same, and owners are still entitled to their share of profits. A low-cost collateralized loan is nice, but I can get comparable loans elsewhere (especially if the DSR increases). So what is the mechanism by which the Sagittarius Engine increases the value of each MKR token? Things I can think of:   Rather than a traditional collateralized loan, where I can borrow up to (for example) 6,000 DAI against 10,000 DAI worth of MKR with an LR of 60% \u2014 instead, each MKR token should be entitled to avail itself of its share of the total funds we\u2019ve sent into the Sagittarius Engine, irrespective of the price of MKR. For example, in the early days if there are 10M DAI in the Sagittarius Engine and 1M MKR tokens extant, then each MKR token can borrow up to 10 DAI. Not great, but it solves the problem of \u25c82.5B of collateral chasing \u25c8100M in available loans. It also doesn\u2019t matter whether MKR price fluctuates \u2014 there\u2019s no risk of liquidation (excluding dilution and interest, which we can consider later). Much later, after 10B DAI have accrued in the Sagittarius Engine and if 1M MKR tokens are extant, each MKR token can borrow up to 10,000 DAI (even if MKR is valued at 2,500 DAI). This would have the direct effect of increasing the value of each MKR token. It\u2019s sort of like MIP 49: Staking Rewards, but has the best of both worlds: cash is, effectively, returned to holders (like rewards/dividends); yet without a tax hit (like burning/buybacks).   By reducing the chance of a governance attack with borrowed MKR.   Locking MKR in the SE gives 2x governance power, but eventually that should mostly even out, so I don\u2019t see a big benefit here.   Not sure if any of those are what you were getting at with \u201ca much stronger and much more immediate effect\u201d @rune but would love to hear specifics on what you have in mind re: what is the mechanism by which the Sagittarius Engine increases the value of each MKR token?

Both options should be allowed.   It feels to me like this would introduce an issue of fungibility between MKR that have withdrawn funds and those which haven\u2019t; or, at least, it would introduce a challenging accounting problem. Instead, I would prefer to reduce the interest rate on the MKR-backed SE \u201cloan\u201d to 0, unless there\u2019s a legal reason not to. ",

I didn\u2019t touch on it much in the post but it is a critical piece of the plan that we should begin to ramp up real world marketing to onboard new people into crypto through Dai and MKR. If we have a low, but decent DSR, and we have the infrastructure and real world examples in place that proves money placed in Dai helps finance the sustainable revolution, we have met the conditions for a high powered real world and online marketing campaign positioning Dai as better money that provides the user with a lot of benefits, while also doing their part for the future. Additionally we can market MKR as a more exotic crypto asset that has significant utility because it provides access to extremely cheap, decentralized credit and is exposed to the success of Dai - and buying MKR is an even better way for someone to play a big part in trying to turn around the system towards sustainability, and even means you can get rare NFTs for doing so. This marketing should IMO initially focus particularly on the climate resilient, english speaking countries like Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia and NZ, as well as the rest of europe. We should avoid the US both to avoid their regulatory aggression, but also because the US is pretty much the only place in the world with climate change deniers in 2021 lol. I believe that if we are ready to significantly increase the budgets of the core unit bureaucracy to also include structures for self-optimizing checks and balances, we will be able to launch massive marketing campaigns that are both aligned when it comes to brand and messaging, but are parallelizable and highly scalable all thanks to the potential of the Core Unit bureaucracy that the community has bootstrapped.

While Maker can try to accomplish the goals of this vision even if Maker grew to 1T it would not have enough oomph to carry it out. Literally global warming - or as I personally like to reframe the entire question - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY on all fronts (from energy, to mass, to species/life) is the real issue.   There are a lot of contributors to this but in the end it is a sheer lack of ability for people via governments to agree about anything, and corporations which have for the most part free reign to \u2018profit\u2019 however they see fit without any concern for the planet and the life upon it.  Do I honestly see Maker doing better here?   Not yet.  It is one of many DAOs scraping for income to survive much less thrive and achieve. I feel like if Maker could do ONE thing to improve the situation it would be to focus on a long game of financial sustainability, achieve the goal somewhat put forward as a statement of systemic failure of the current financial system by S. Nakimoto in the Bitcoin genesis block that started blockchain technology: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\" Let this settle in for a while. To date Maker in its desire to grow is basically being forced to take on the mantle of the old financial system - so it can interface with \u2018the world\u2019 vs. creating a new better world within crypto that the rest of the world has to come to. Global warming?    Honestly If there was one thing I would like to see Maker take on is DAI and the Maker system being focused on becoming the most sound and solid financial instrument on the planet, used for all transactions big and small on all networks.    If we can once and for all solve the problem posed by S. Nakimoto with the statement in his genesis block then perhaps we can finally begin to approach some of the larger issues like global sustainability from earth to sky and everything in between. I really don\u2019t want to get into a climate change debate because I honestly don\u2019t see that a solution to global warming is going to change the fact that the decline in species is pretty much on par with the last extinction event.    The earth too will survive all of these things like it has done in the past, the question is whether people will or not.   What I have found of interest is that no-one talks about isn\u2019t whether global warming will tip the climate cycle into another mode but whether even 1-2C can stave off the next ice age because as I read the geologic record the earth is fabulously good at sinking carbon once released.  Hence why the glaciation record is growing longer and deeper into colder temps with interglacials.    When people talk about this they tend to focus on the sustainability (or lack thereof) of what we are doing now and focus exclusively on \u2018climate change\u2019 when in reality the long view here is that higher earth temps would be good, but probably are not sustainable with increased carbon emissions (unless we can sustain those).  Higher carbon in the atmosphere also has ancillary benefit of faster plant growth.  Anyone who reads back to the 1600\u2019s knows that the sun going blank for 80 or so years caused massive crop failures due to the shortened growing season due to lower earth temps (correlation or causation?).    Surely these points will still be something people disagree on but the reports are pretty clear - cold earth meant famine.   Just like whether what humans are doing in total is sustainable long term.   In almost every country, and even in this chat we will see our own divisions regarding fact leading to opinion are divided.  I personally look to what can be practically achieved or being achievable, others want a vision even if it isn\u2019t practically achievable to drive them.  Yet another will have a different view. The hardest thing to do is to nurture consensus, the easiest thing is for one person to do is to destroy the consensus of many. My opinion is that almost all of human kinds endeavors are likely on a unsustainable trajectories.  There are many things I would like to see, but a planet covered in ice and one that is a desert isn\u2019t really what I was hoping for.   For quite some time I considered the greatest threat to humanity wasn\u2019t global warming but something (Perhaps in the sun) changes so the earth begins to cool again and there will be nothing we can do about this except bundle up and learn how to live in the ice.   By then we probably will have to have our other sustainability issues figured out one way or another or we would just go back to old ways with our technology buried while we live as caveman for someone in the next interglacial to discover and wonder about how we could lose so much so quickly. If I had a simple vision for Maker it would be: \u201cDAI and the Maker system being focused on becoming the most sound and solid financial instrument on the planet, used for all transactions big and small on all networks.\u201d Lets start there.   I am all for entertaining any and all proposals that support the above.  I would even support a CU visionary team to discuss long term vision for Maker that includes global sustainability as a core goal.

                    "content": "I don\u2019t have much time tonight so just want to say thanks for the comments, and just add a few points: Can we do anything about climate change? Man made climate change is absolutely certain. The 30k scientists in the IPCC + all the 200 national governments in the world (including oil countries like saudi arabia) + all oil companies in the world all agree on this and agree with the trajectories spelled out by the extremely well researched IPCC assesments. Can we do anything to stop it? No probably not. I think at this point we are past \u201csaving the world\u201d and at the \u201csaving what\u2019s left\u201d stage Let me repost this picture from above:  77_image-asset1294\u00d71120 162 KB  Some of the most pessimistic estimates that both consider our current trajectory (which is exceeding RCP 8.5) and then consider extreme exponential feedback loops (like methane clathrates etc) say that 4 degrees by 2060 isn\u2019t impossible. If that\u2019s the case then yes, there is nothing we can do. Even 1 trillion tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be able to stop an irreversible change of the world, only change how bad it gets. Personally, I don\u2019t think it will get that bad but I do think it will get very, very bad, and the world as we know it will basically collapse. So with that in mind, if we assume that there is a high likelihood that the climate change has already crossed the point of no return in terms of being catastrophic, this is where the climate alpha comes in. We need to create a currency that is backed by real estate and business activity in the green areas on that map, because that will be the type of currency the future will demand. (Obviously im not advocating literally using that map to guide our collateral strategy but in practice it is possible to find strong research about which areas will be resilient in a climate collapse, such as the recent paper referenced here https://www.theweek.co.uk/climate-change/953660/best-places-to-survive-collapse-of-society It\u2019s kind of a hedging strategy to both do sustainability AND resilience. If we succeed with sustainability and the world is saved, maker will have played a part of saving the world and through this will have earned us a political right to exist. If the world doesn\u2019t succeed so well, and there is partial collapse, then we end up as the only currency that is backed by a diversified basket of the few good areas that remain. Just using NZD or CAD won\u2019t be as good, because you never know which of these areas will get wiped out by war. You need diversified exposure, and that\u2019s what we can provide and market to people. Initially people will probably care more about the sustainability because they are more looking for hope. Then over time, as things get more serious, people will instead be looking for resilience. By beginning to do both in parallel now, we will have something that is incredibly congruent with any of the possible trajectories the world will take. ",

The thing all of these have in common is that they are progress on the digital and information frontier, where there are no physical limits to how things can grow and surpass what\u2019s already there. Unfortunately energy production, agriculture, construction etc are dealing with the laws of physics and thermodynamics. Instead of technology bringing exponential change, we get more incremental improvements. Things like perovskite solar cells, solid state batteries, floating windmills, LFTR nuclear, and even fusion are going to make a difference, but it is not going to change the basic math of the situation 10x, more like 1.5x or maybe 2x if we\u2019re lucky, and that\u2019s still many years into the future and are problems that have been worked on for decades. If you\u2019re looking for a technological solution, I\u2019d argue DeFi is our best bet. Things like Maker and even KlimaDAO that act as coordination tools for humans to muster the massive amounts of capital necessary to fund the long, hard road of performing millions of incremental improvements across the global economy.

Solar, wind, and efficiency are cheap, easy to deploy, and sufficient to meet the need. If there is desire to debate this further then I suggest we frame the debate around the precautionary principle, that is, advocates of nuclear power shall be encumbered to show that nukes are safe, rather than asking opponents of nuclear power to show that nuke are unsafe. The unsafety of nukes should be the baseline assumption. ",

If you rely too much energy sources with intermittency issues you create huge tail risks for society that can only be mitigated by absurd amounts of batteries, which are incredibly expensive. And we need to continue to develop fission so we can eventually get to fusion. I believe the recent breakthrough in tokemak magnets was the needed 0 to 1 moment that means it is now finally within reach and could be the energy source that helps humanity reclaim the world after the big shocks of abrupt climate change have happened and things have stabilized in the new post-collapse norm. Getting excited about fusion and other sci-fi subjects like that is exactly the kind of stuff that will galvanize the community to grow and strengthen so that we have a chance to make a real impact. But yes would be great to have a longer term discussion in the community about what does the sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure of the future even look like, and how does it change in different scenarios (such as rcp 8.5 vs rcp 2.6)?

I have worked on all sorts of power generation projects - coal (Indonesia, India, Philippines), diesel (Panama, Guatemala), petroleum coke (Chile), hydro (Costa Rica), natural gas (China, India, Singapore, Philippines, Australia) and nuclear (Finland and US). Since 2012, I have been exclusively involved in the LNG space as countries sought to transition from coal to lower carbon natural gas. This has required doing long-term deals with offtakers in Europe, Southeast Asia and East/North Asia. Hopefully I can add some perspective to the discussion.     rune:  But IMO nuclear is the only thing that you can build anywhere that can provide a base load - hydro and geothermal only exists in certain place, and at limited capacity. If you rely too much energy sources with intermittency issues you create huge tail risks for society that can only be mitigated by absurd amounts of batteries, which are incredibly expensive.   I have slowly come around to @rune\u2019s position on nuclear even though I lived in Tokyo at the time of the Fukushima incident. Energy is a base and critical component of human development. Almost all countries aspire to an \u201cenergy-rich\u201d lifestyle. Ultimately, to get an \u201cenergy rich\u201d lifestyle, there will have to be a combination of energy sources. Other than geothermal (which will require new drilling technology), no single technology will be suited for \u201call places\u201d. I am originally from western New York and, despite New York\u2019s strong push for solar, there are some (many) days in winter that are grey and dark. But solar is an important resource for New York to maximize. Interesting, that none of the discussion on the Forum has focused on the \u201cfirst fuel\u201d \u2026 energy efficiency. So where does this leave Maker? There has been, and will continue to be, a political and societal focus on energy infrastructure. Again, this is part of the \u201cenergy rich\u201d lifestyle. There appears to be adequate private and public capital to be deployed for energy projects. I would argue that energy projects can benefit Maker. To the extent that Maker wants to incorporate long-term, stable assets as a diversifier to support DAI, an energy project is almost a perfect candidate. While there have been high profile failures over time, most projects are long-term, well-structured, and undertaken by entities with a strong balance sheet. They also scale very quickly! Technologies will evolve. However, the demand for an \u201cenergy rich\u201d lifestyle is unlikely to change. As a result, there will be plenty of opportunities. I do not suggest that, today, Maker make DAI available for the newest hydrogen electrolysis facility - the market is too new and there is too much risk. However as Rune notes:     rune:  Things like Maker and even KlimaDAO that act as coordination tools for humans to muster the massive amounts of capital necessary to fund the long, hard road of performing millions of incremental improvements across the global economy.   This is the true power of Maker. Incremental improvements associated with high-quality, long-term assets can benefit Maker. ",

We want to know how we can work together to expose the MakerDao governance to the sustainability efforts we specialize in. We have several years of experience and over 200 energy efficiency and sustainability related projects, as well as a top team in climate sciences and building performance that can provide knowledge on how to improve the Maker organization from within as well as assess the impact we can make. We are also developing our own smart contract solutions to bring the built environment to the blockchain and provide decentralized services for multiple parties in the energy and efficiency world. So how can we help? We are prepared to submit proposals to the MakerDao governance, set meetings and deadlines for real investment possibilities and create impactful change in a decentralized world.

                    "content": "Great question. The very short answer I suppose is that the financial markets are far away from efficient. And its even further away from efficient when it needs to start working with new asset classes - and exceptionally slow in making appropriate changes to work with them. On top of that, financial market participants cost structures are troublesome (for many reasons: from regulatory burdens to legacy IT), speed of execution not quite there either. I believe they are also being held back by shareholder short-term demands - i.e. hard to dedicate a lot of investment capital to new businesses and new processes etc\u2026 You might even also say they are being held back by regulators who set the \u201crules of game\u201d for them - and they, for sure, are not moving fast enough to catch up with the opportunities (and challenges) the world serves up. Such as climate change. Anyways - All in all - this means capital doesn\u2019t effectively and efficiently go to where it could go. There are plenty of asset classes and segments that are not getting the capital one might think it should be entitled to if you used \u2018first principles\u2019 of risk/return. Now, MakerDAO is reasonably unconstrained by many of the above factors. So, on a very broad brush basis, it seems sensible to believe the MakerDAO can:   identify these sector and segments - there are plenty of them.   ensure entry into these segments are with business models and structures that can compete with TradFi incumbents/potential entrants - i.e models that deliberately extend MakerDAO\u2019s low cost structure, flexible finance terms, etc, perhaps even embed other DeFi protocols to make the position even stronger (I was thinking about some of the fixed rate protocols - but I am sure there are others of value) to come up with a strong proposition hard to compete with for pure TradFi.   With that sort of thinking, I would believe MakerDAO can build some large competitive positions fairly fast that will be hard to dislodge given its underpinning DeFi/TradFi integrated structure (and ultimately its raw size). To some degree we just need to try and run ahead of the general financial markets in working with businesses as they try to rejig for a Net-Zero world requirement - and MakerDAO should get to a very enviable position in the long-run.

                    "content": "Hey everyone, Porter here with a16z. We\u2019re really excited about the breadth of future possibilities for Maker and appreciate Rune\u2019s thoughtful posts sparking this discussion. We can\u2019t think of another space where a community is looking to finance Gen. IV nuclear reactors. It\u2019s awesome. Establishing DAI as a source of clean money can help spearhead a new narrative for Maker as an economic and social force. But as the forums have illuminated, there are larger strategic questions nestled within the current dialogue which require community consensus before forging a new path ahead. Effectively channeling the potential energy behind the narrative of clean money first requires laying the foundation for a purpose-driven DAO. (1) What is Maker\u2019s core mission? (2) Based on this vision, what is Maker\u2019s role in the DeFi ecosystem? (3) How can we expand that role long-term to create the most real-world impact? An engaged, aligned community with a defined sense of purpose is a powerful instrument for any organization (see Tesla). Answering these questions can help set forth a clear mission, codify an investment framework to support it, and establish the community\u2019s role in accomplishing it. Think of it as a new social contract with Maker. While the community will ultimately decide these answers, we would love to provide our perspective to help get there. (1) What is the core mission? Maker\u2019s model is unique. Issuing stablecoins through a decentralized lending platform inherently introduces tensions between various stakeholders, each of whom have different interests. Given these dynamics, should Maker serve in a core capacity (1) paralleling that of a crypto central bank, with a corresponding focus on issuing DAI and maintaining its peg (the status quo), or (2) that of an innovative investment fund seeking to maximize profit and social impact, or (3) some hybrid function? More fundamentally, we also need to determine if Maker has other social or environmental mandates that should structure organizational decision-making, and the appropriate balance as a profit-seeking financial institution and a socially-minded organization. Perhaps these motives are intertwined. As outlined in other posts, a set of refined principles is necessary to guide long-term strategy. The live polls are a great first step in this direction. The agreed-upon principles should specifically address the desire to pivot Maker\u2019s mandate to address climate change, whether this affects the type of collateral Maker accepts (and from whom), and to what extent Maker\u2019s profits should further these goals. (2) What is Maker\u2019s role in the DeFi ecosystem? The Real-World Sandbox Project was designed to answer this question, but in the interim here are some initial thoughts. Maker began with a grassroots focus. It\u2019s in the DNA. At a certain point however, exponentially scaling the DAI supply will require significant relationships with institutional partners like Societe Generale. It is more economically and organizationally efficient. A few institutional partnerships have the same effect as thousands of individual vaults. While this concentrates risk with those partners, the efficiencies of scale are significant. It also has the added benefit of shaping the types of collateral (i.e. clean energy bonds) those institutions onboard if they want to work with Maker. As a result, if Maker continues trending in this direction market currents will naturally push it towards a more senior position in the financing stack. This distributes risk analysis to institutions with deep expertise in it, which lets Maker scale. The business proposition thus becomes threefold: (1) a high-volume, low-risk credit pool for trusted larger financial institutions (2) a retail facility for individual users (maintaining universal DAI access) (3) a stablecoin tollgate through Peg Stability Modules Leveraging the volume of institutional assets can help to increase Maker\u2019s impact in an equitable and transparent manner, generating benefits for retail users, the community, and society writ large. (3) How can we expand Maker\u2019s role to create the most real-world impact? This is the heart of Rune\u2019s post on the Sagittarius Engine. The better the business model, the larger the impact Maker has on whatever mission the community sets out to accomplish. Tokenomics can help accelerate this flywheel. An important insight here is how Maker wants to make an impact. It can do so by incentivizing certain types of collateral on the front end or by distributing profits to certain initiatives on the back end. Assets come in as collateral and money goes out as profit. Both are levers. Developing parameters for sustainable, resilient, and diversified collateral can be a forcing function to potential customers, creating impacts on those within Maker\u2019s orbit (i.e. Maker offers lower rates for collateralized bonds of a solar company versus another entity). On the other hand, determining how to distribute profits (i.e. 5% go to community-approved clean energy projects) can create impacts outside of Maker\u2019s traditional sphere of influence. Both can work, we just need to explicitly define which levers are used to what ends. Consequently, (1) Is it more important for Maker to (a) immediately act as an instrument against climate change or (b) continue to steadily grow as a business with a new social mandate to become that instrument? If (a), then some form of MKR issuance probably makes sense. If (b), then new MKR issuance could still be useful as an incentive to attract new community members and reward existing ones, but would need to be carefully metered to avoid short-term participation. We\u2019re connecting the requirement for increased capitalization of Maker towards a desire to reorient the protocol for immediate effects. Issuing MKR is akin to front loading future profits, but without bootstrapping the engine to generate them over time. This is fine if that money is used to create a more powerful engine in the first place, but not if it\u2019s a cash-out that indirectly attempts to do so. Companies issue stock to raise money they need. If the community decides Maker needs more money, below are some key details related to a potential issuance.  Why does Maker need money? How much money would Maker need, and when? What will it do with the money? How will an issuance help drive the clean money narrative? At what point does an issuance affect the value of other MKR tokens, and what parameters can be set to avoid this outcome? What realignment within the community could occur based on this change of strategy? What does an issuance achieve, and at what timescale, that could not be accomplished with profits already accruing in the treasury?  (2) How will re-designed tokenomics help Maker successfully accomplish its mission? The second part of our analysis involves the impact of re-designed tokenomics. Regardless of the final outcome to this process, any tokenomic changes should be straightforward, directly impactful, clearly correlated with Maker\u2019s mission, and innovative. One simplified possibility would be to incorporate Rune\u2019s proposed voting \u201cpower-boosts\u201d for locked-up Maker on a linear schedule (one year lock-up equals 1.25x voting power, two year lock-up equals 1.5x voting power, three year lock-up equals 1.75x voting power, etc.), and then distribute purchased MKR to those same staked MKR holders instead of burning it. Staked MKR holders can choose to lock their new MKR up for more voting power, sell it if they need money, or contribute it towards financing clean energy projects (see below). The voting power-boost mechanism is particularly innovative and could spark a transformation in governance thought across the space. Another option, dependent on the appropriate legal structure, would be to direct a portion of profits to approved clean energy projects voted on by staked MKR holders. This provides an opportunity to support sustainable infrastructure that community members can voluntarily join if they are so inclined. A third option involves incentivizing the types of collateral Maker accepts as real-world assets. This does not require a change in tokenomics. Maker could accept specified clean energy assets as collateral at favorable rates to encourage further investment in the space. The key here is creating a structured, streamlined process for onboarding. These ideas are primarily meant to spark a deeper conversation. The best ideas are still out there, we just want to plant the seeds to iterate for future ones. Overall, we love the discussion and look forward to seeing it evolve. You can always reach me via email at [email\u00a0protected], on Telegram @portersmith, or directly here on the forums. We appreciate the opportunity to join the conversation and we\u2019re excited for Maker\u2019s future! ",

But it faces many hurdles to make it easy for the average property owner to tackle and make an impact.  Climate finance (funding from private or public sources to pay for adaptation and mitigation measures) is crucial for combating the climate crisis. There is a large gap between what is being invested and what is required to reduce carbon emissions and part of the problem is access to financial mechanisms to finance projects. The project to credit process is complicated and fragmented which leads to repetitive actions, higher costs, and longer times, in most cases initiatives projects do not get executed. Converting energy efficiency projects into investable assets is complicated and costly under the current status quo. By enabling the aggregation of investments from a large number of investors, tokenization can facilitate the flow of private financing to investable energy efficiency projects. Using blockchain and DeFi allows to coordinate and validate efforts from all participants in the ecosystem for a better outcome.  Our most important challenge will be solved through collaboration and this is an area we are working on. ",

Clearly, this key sustainability market is ripe for disruption. Just as clearly, the Ethereum ecosystem is pumped to leverage ultra-sound money, DeFi, and Maker Dai directly financing desperately needed sustainable economic development, directly creating good jobs and real benefits in collaboration with real communities. As you point out, beyond finance, our larger ecosystem has a lot to offer Maker-backed projects\u2013directly or indirectly through partners: collective learning about project facilitation, coordination, governance via DAOs, as well as open-source skills-sharing models. Here, I\u2019m also thinking of Mondragon its world-class project-team-organizing and mentoring efforts as a model to learn from to ensure success of Maker\u2019s sustainability-focused investments.

When I finally understood, I was fascinated by the vision, so I got on the rollercoaster ride that MKR holders were on, although I didn\u2019t see if there would be a further ride at the bottom of the next dump. Nevertheless, I have been holding some MKR tokens ever since. Although reading the daily problems over the years has dimmed the gloss of that vision for me. With this new direction, I feel again the old fire that was in this project. I\u2019m in, though I know it will be a bumpy ride. I do miss one thing:     rune:  The name Sagittarius comes from the location of the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, which holds the entire galaxy together, keeping it in a stable equilibrium.   when I read this part, I thought that the project would include support for the space ecosystem. This industry seems to be as risky and promising as crypto was 6-8 years ago, but that is why it is important to start in this direction in time and very carefully.  The opportunity is here now and is constantly expanding. And one more thing: in case we all fail to save the planet, we have to give another chance to the generation that will live to see it. They may have to live in space because of our mistakes. This could be an important goal. The future will never be exactly as we imagine it now. ",

I\u2019d like to acknowledge that primates generally love the taste of meat. Chimps rarely have an opportunity to eat meat but love it when they can get it. Chewing tough meat was a challenge until we learned how to control fire about two million years ago. Since then, meat has been an extremely important component of our diet. However, the times have changed. Nutritious plant food is easily available year round. For example, ripe avocados are available during the Canadian winter. Even if you can\u2019t stop eating animal products overnight, try to eat less meat and dairy. I understand why it\u2019s hard; A plant-based diet is going against millions of years of evolution.  ",

RT @rune, and what\u2019s the most powerful way to get peeps excited\u2013even inspired\u2013? My answer, in the context of what I term \u201cdesperate capitalism\u201d\u2013referring to the global relative lack of profitable investment opportunities & general de-skilled employment profiles offered within legacy systems (since at least 2008) coupled with the historically unprecedented concentration of wealth\u2013would be ==>a solid source of income, IE jobs\u2013especially good jobs doing \u2018good\u2019 things that [hopefully] will make a real difference, possibly even mitigating the worst impacts of climate chaos\u2026 and that\u2019s exactly the sort of stuff we/Maker could/should do with our ability to decentralize finance\u2026strategically finance the kinds of work/projects that WE desperately need to happen, but which aren\u2019t happening precisely because of what you (kindly) term the:     rune:  coordination problem   But I believe it\u2019s a huge strategic mistake for us to frame the problem as: people aren\u2019t     rune:  interested in actually practically doing something about the problem   People simply aren\u2019t aware of what they CAN actually do about the problem and they/WE don\u2019t trust the legacy control infrastructures (governments, corps, social institutions) to do anything that actually could make a difference and so it DOES feel overwhelming because, yes climate chaos IS already beginning to directly and powerfully impact real lives globally. So as with the failure of \u201ctrust\u201d in legacy finance capital\u2013which as we all realize IS also at the source of this amazing new tech you/we geniuses have invented literally in the last decade or so\u2013doing something/anything about incipient climate chaos appears hopeless to so many\u2013and it actually IS hopeless-- precisely because we\u2019ve left coming up with real effective solutions to this dying legacy control (governance) infrastructure, forms of governance hopelessly ineffective and inherent to bureaucratic structures which were born 500 years ago with the emergence of mass literacy (thanks to Guttenberg\u2019s press\u2013I think of it as \u201cliteracy 1.0\u201d). So the whole climate crisis and lack of effective action is another aspect of the failure of trust within which our lives continue to operate. It\u2019s a ubiquitous crisis of trust\u2013but now literacy 2.0 has emerged\u2026and continuing to rely on governance by any and ALL bureaucratic institutions in most aspect of our lives has now\u2013obviously and dangerously\u2013outlived it\u2019s usefulness, if not sanity itself! Hence the danger and opportunity within our context. To be inspired to actually DO something about climate, people will need to believe that what we\u2019re proposing can actually work IE, peeps will only be inspired by seeing a possibility for effective action.  So let\u2019s talk about exactly what effective action looks like and how our Maker community\u2013already at the forefront of disrupting legacy governance in finance\u2013can do to inspire people about the possibility of effective action. If we build THAT, they will come\u2026because peeps have already lost all trust in legacy governance to solve ANY real problem. ",

                    "content": "@rune: This is definitely a worthwhile initiative that should (1) enhance the resilience of DAI; (2) attract new market participants to DAI; and (3) position MakerDAO as an environmentally responsible DeFi protocol. Focusing on the ESG collateral is also the right thing to do in today\u2019s world where all responsible asset owners and managers try to do their fair share to slow down global warming and global climate change. Most institutional fund managers have launched ESG fixed income funds, while most asset owners require the inclusion of ESG processes into the standard fixed income investment processes (yes, greenwashing is an issue). As a portfolio manager with 14 years of experience in corporate fixed income with large institutional fund managers, I would like to share two points on (1) diversification and on (2) liquidity: (1) DIVERSIFICATION is key for running any corporate fixed income portfolio in order to achieve resilient and stable returns and to avoid gap risks, e.g. environmental gap risks. To achieve stable returns, diversification is important not only across different borrowers, green industries and duration buckets, but also across different COUNTRIES and regions. Fund managers often use a Sharp Ratio to measure the stability and resilience of returns. The higher the ratio, the more resilient the returns are. Here is a useful link: Low Correlation High Sharpe Ratio - Rayner Gobran The main point is that to achieve STABLE returns, portfolio managers should look at  (1) the \u201creturns / volatility\u201d ratio for each asset class in their portfolio (the higher the better)  AND  (2) the correlation between asset classes (the lower the better). This is where diversification across countries comes in.   Overall, I fully agree with @rune that \u201cYou need diversified exposure, and that\u2019s what we can provide and market to people.\u201d Focusing solely on so-called \u201cSuper\u201d Countries (UK, Switzerland, Canada and New Zealand) is unlikely to achieve the desired level of return stability and diversification. Although these countries bear investment grade credit ratings, they are still prone to idiosyncratic gap risks that are highly likely to jeopardise returns\u2019 stability, e.g.   the UK: *ongoing troubles in Northern Ireland related to Brexit; *Scotland\u2019s independence and the subsequent loss of a third of UK\u2019s territory; *the UK has had three parliamentary elections since 2015, i.e. new elections and a new government every 24 months.   Canada: *one of the highest CO2 per capita and CO2 per unit of GDP globally (higher than those ratios in China and in the US) due to large oil&gas (oil sands ) and metals&mining sectors; *substantial interconnectedness with the US and Chinese economies.   Additionally, the UK, Switzerland and Canada are highly connected to the global economy and generate 50-120% of their GDP from foreign trade. Hence, any global slowdown due to a climate crisis is likely to meaningfully impact these three countries. Data sources:  Global connectedness index (see page 49): https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/dhl-spotlight/documents/pdf/spotlight-g04-global-connectedness-index-2020.pdf  Foreign trade as a percentage of GDP: Trade (% of GDP) | Data  CO2 emissions by countries: JRC Publications Repository   If the community is interested, I can source and comment on research from Moody\u2019s and S&P that looks at the drivers of corporate defaults. In a nutshell, the country of operations is not the key driver, but the industry is. As a result, diversification across countries is mainly a source of return stability, not return volatility. (2) LIQUIDITY is key for achieving resilient and stable returns. Here, I again agree with @rune that \u201cESG corporate bonds protected by a world class trustee in the UK\u201d exhibit superior liquidity and the risk/return profile. With one key comment, while all these bonds should be listed in the UK (or Ireland or a similarly established jurisdiction), not all these bonds should come from the UK-based companies (see the diversification section above). Also, diversification is positively related to liquidity. A more diversified portfolio will have more positions and, thus, smaller positions that will be easier to liquidate in case of any crisis (environmental, political, etc). A diversified portfolio is generally a more liquid portfolio. SOLUTION: focus on ESG corporate bonds ACROSS THE GLOBE. As a UK resident and citizen, I fully agree with and support @williamr: \u201cLiving in one of the \u201cresilient places\u201d on earth, I take that as a personal duty to assist in the transition for the rest of the earth.\u201d I would like to say a special thank you to the New Silver team (@prankstr25 and @John_NewSilver) for introducing me to MakerDAO.

                    "content": "IMO I love the idea of the \u201cClean Money\u201d initiative by Rune! Not because I am a green fanatic, although I recognise that climate change is 100% manmade, but because it gives Maker a new sense of identity and a clear mission. The current goal Maker is somewhat hard to define, although I would loosely define it as a decentralised central bank that has an overcollateralized currency and aims to grow by expanding its collateral requirements and expanding onto other chains, a bit convoluted! I believe that as admirable as this goal is, it\u2019s not a long-term growth strategy and Maker need to have something which nobody else in DeFi has. This being a long term growth strategy of lending reserves to Green Energy projects and generating a return. This will have the dual purpose of making Maker stakeholders and Maker users happy by generating a return and \u201csaving the planet\u201d. I understand that the you could argue that \u201csaving the planet\u201d has nothing to do with Maker\u2019s core goals but if we adopt the \u201cClean Money\u201d proposal we can alter Maker\u2019s identity radically, attract new users, media exposure and generate some long needed hype about sustainable finance through DeFi! My 2 cents  ",
