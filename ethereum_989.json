There are both technical and philosophical obstacles to overcome. This Ring is to begin discussions and coordinated experimentation for human identity systems. For more information, please see the Ring Charter: https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Identity-Ring Recent discussions about this subject:     Request for Feedback: Upala, a standard to unite different identity systems Identity Ring       Hey, magicians!  I\u2019m building a digital identity system Upala. It helps to calculate uniqueness scores for users.  I came up with a design that allows building an identity system out of smart contracts, united under the same staking and user evaluation standard.  I thought it would be a good idea to publish it here and maybe shape up it a little bit (or have a sanity check  ). So that others could use it too. The docs are here, and the full copy is below.   In short The main idea i\u2026         Identity and Quadratic Funding: standards to help fund projects and commons Identity Ring       Is anyone interested in organizing standards for quadratic funding?    At nearly Magicians\u2019 gathering there is a group of people coming together to discuss the issue of funding in the community. @anettrolikova and I even had a discussion at Devcon in Osaka, a session with the EF Grants Team and Cat Herders to discuss the funding of Magicians\u2019 work.  Many prominent efforts have emerged as alternatives to \u201cgrants from whales\u201d: Moloch DAO, MetaCartel DAO, all of the options that Gitcoin offers, and\u2026     ",
