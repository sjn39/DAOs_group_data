The risk of becoming a victim of a $5 wrench attack, phishing/hacker attacks, or the risk of unexpected negative consequences due to regulatory uncertainty, you name it. I want to encourage everyone to increase the level of anonymity and by that reduce the risk of becoming a victim. With this overview, I hope to support the transition to a peaceful, legitimate, and resilient \u201canon society\u201d. The timing in MakerDAO is perfect with the structural changes led by the implementation of the Endgame plan. At the same time, the SubDAO/Ecosystem Actor setup offers the perfect environment for anon participation and contribution. You are still early. Your first step is not to tell anyone you consider becoming an anon - I\u2019m dead serious. Follow the recommendations and vanish - ping me, if you get stuck or need help, I\u2019ll leave my contact details below. I will write guides if you need them! Need support? I\u2019m happy to discuss details with you on Discord, in the forum chat, on Twitter, or by email. I am hoping to see these communication platforms replaced, with something more focused on anonymity, in the future. if you prefer encrypted communication, we can use PGP-encrypted emails. How to send a PGP encrypted email? Email: [email\u00a0protected] \u2190 This is my ProtonMail. Q: How do I send PGP encrypted emails with ProtonMail? A: Emails between ProtonMail users are encrypted automatically. (Setting up a new account on ProtonMail only takes 2 minutes but requires a phone number, get yourself a burner sim first.) Q: How do I Send PGP-encrypted emails using Gmail? A: Unfortunately, Gmail isn\u2019t set up to encrypt your messages with PGP straight out of the box, so you will have to do some tinkering and install a Google Chrome browser extension. The plugin called FlowCrypt is available in the chrome web store. Below you will find an Overview, some recommendations, and a list of some of the most frequent convenience-based tradeoffs.   Rails a) Hardware b) Software c) Infrastructure   Finance a) On-chain b) Off-chain   Interaction a) People b) Access/Registration c) Online presence d) Public presence e) Interaction infrastructure   Avoid being doxxed   Reboot of identity   Overview, recommendations, and some of the convenience-based tradeoffs you are likely to consider. By following the recommendations, you will hopefully be able to work, receive payments, and communicate in a more anonymous way than you are used to. Becoming and staying an anon can be thought of as a single arrangement challenge that spans three different, but interrelated elements: rails, finance, and interaction. Understanding the differences in these elements is key to protecting you because arrangement decisions with respect to one might affect the others. Once you have everything in place, you must avoid being doxxed by yourself or someone else. Convenience often compromises security. If you believe your identity has been doxxed beyond recovery, I recommend that you reboot your identity. 1) Rails Rails encapsulate the hardware, software, and infrastructure you rely on for being able to work. The rails act as the foundation upon which the other two elements of anonymity can be established and maintained: finance and interaction. a) Hardware Recommendations  Use a designated phone and computer when you work as an anon, never use these devices for any personal purposes.  b) Software Recommendations  Use a VPN (Consider setting up your own (here is a guide). Watch out not to leak any personal details like IP address, payment information, email, username, etc. in the process of setting it up.) Consider if and when you want to use TOR - pay attention to the limitations of the TOR network. Never log into any web2 accounts on the browser/VPN you are using with your anon identity. Consider using Qubes or Tails as the operating system on your computer when working as an anon or install Whonix on your Mac/Windows OS. Every time, before you start working, make sure the VPN directs you to the right location - consider activating a \u2018kill switch\u2019, so you can not connect to the internet without the VPN is running.  c) Infrastructure Recommendations  Avoid communicating using your sim card (text messages/speaking).  2) Finance You work and you get paid. Finance encapsulates the on-chain and off-chain activities you engage in on a personal level. You stand at a diverging road. If you trust an exchange, your fate is in their hands. You might do on-chain obfuscation before moving the funds to the exchange. This risk causing additional questions from the exchange and bank.  Depending on how strict your bank is, It might even compromise your right to uphold the customer relationship with the bank. The other path is to only exchange your crypto to fiat through exchanging activities that are not requiring KYC, for instance, P2P. Remember, large p2p transactions are likely to also raise awareness among the bank employees. If you choose to use an undoxxed wallet and avoid exchanges, please be aware that Infura (Metamask standard) logs your IP address, so make sure to use a VPN when creating and engaging with that wallet. a) On-chain Recommendations  Fund your wallet from the exchange where you will be cashing out. Or use an undoxxed Ethereum wallet  Watch out, Infura will log your IP address if you use Metamask, a more private alternate is Frame.sh. If you want to stick with Metamask, use a VPN. Consider running your own node.  2. Off-chain Recommendations   Prepare a narrative for your bank (they will ask for it sooner or later), where you are able to satisfy their requirements for documenting \u201cSource of Funds\u201d and the \u201cPurpose\u201d of your business activities. It has to cover why it is harmless and acceptable that you receive cryptocurrency as payment for your work. e.g. IT consultancy services, etc. Of course no lies, but you need to speak the same language as the bank employee.   Always remain polite and sound cooperative if your bank asks you questions.   3) Interaction Interaction encapsulates your engagement with people through your public and online presence, the requirements and challenges related to registration and access, and the infrastructure you use when engaging with the outside world. a) Public presence Recommendations  Do not tell anyone about your anon-identity or the work you do as an anon. This includes friends and family. Prepare a narrative about what you are doing and who you are working for.  b) Online presence Recommendations  Do not use the email address and discord user for any other purpose than work. Do not reveal your identity to other participants in the DAO you contribute to. Do not activate the camera or microphone when participating in online calls. Decide what time zone your anon profile is fictitiously located in and be aware that this matches the time of the day you are interacting (on- and offchain). Remove metadata from images and other documents before you share.  c) Registration and access Recommendations  Create an undoxxed email address, Discord user, and forum user, with a username you have never used before and which you can not be associated with. Do not use your personal email or phone number when creating your new email account, discord user, and forum user. Make sure your VPN is running when creating your profiles (www.dnsleaktest.com). Use a prepaid sim card when phone validation is required. Select a username that you have never used before.  d) Infrastructure Recommendations * Use PGP-encrypted emails when possible. * Ask others to use PGP emails if the topic you are going to discuss includes personal information and/or sensitive work-related information. * For quick conversations consider encrypted services (Do not use Signal, it reveals your phone number).  Screenshot 2023-01-25 at 22.45.261250\u00d7904 87.3 KB  4) Avoid being doxxed It is more likely that you are doxxing yourself by mistake than someone else is doxxing you. I highly recommend you to not tell anyone about your anon identity, not even your spouse or closest friends. You will have to live kind of a double life from now on. The eagerness to share a secret like this is biggest in the beginning, you can thank me after a couple of months when you got rid of that urge. Vanish \u2014 you have to stop communicating with anyone and quit all work you do immediately, if you get doxxed beyond recovery - then you vanish - see step 5. 5) Reboot identity If you believe you have been doxxed beyond recovery, I recommend that you to  Become quiet on discord, forum, etc. Only communicate using PGP if you have to talk to anyone Empty your wallet (cash out through the exchange or go through Monero first, depending on the choice you made when you funded your wallet) Delete your profiles and accounts where possible Ditch your VPN Wipe your anon phone Wipe your anon computer If you keep notes on paper, burn it all. Reboot your identity by repeating steps 1) - 4) above.  I define doxxing beyond recovery as when you no longer have full control over who is aware that you are operating your anon profile. ",

What do you think about using a paid proxy on top of the VPN, where the payment to the proxy provider is of course using an undoxxed method?   When talking about VPNs, it is important to differ between commercial VPNs and private VPNs. There is a huge difference in the level of privacy you get. Private is obviously better. To answer your question, I would say a private VPN is currently enough when looking at the threat level MakerDAOs stakeholders are facing. Watch out when using the TOR browser, it will only privacy enhance the browser traffic, using the Discord app will leave the IP trace back to your ISP.     vigilant:  What is the benefit of this? My understanding is that the benefit of tails is that if you need to scrub your identity at any point, the only thing you have to wipe or dispose of is the flash drive it\u2019s installed on. Are there any other benefits? What about Whonix?   Qubes, Whonix and Tails TORifies all your traffic. Tails is only stored in the RAM on the computer, every time you shut it off or reboot, it wipes everything. Tails is easy to use out of the box but offers very little flexibility. For instance, you can not engage with a hardware wallet without making changes to the OS which you are not supposed to as it will increase the risk of malware infection. Qubes is an OS that allows you to run virtual machines within it. This way you create Chinese walls between the different activities. Say you manage files from one virtual machine that does not have internet access, browses random sites on another virtual machine only with TOR access, and participate in meetings from a third virtual machine that connects to the internet through a privately hosted VPN to give you optimal speed. Whonix comes as a default with Qubes. It can be installed on Mac (not on ARM models) or Windows. It is a virtual machine that allows you to torify all your activities, not only the browser activities.     vigilant:  This is the part about being anon that seems the most difficult. Telling a bank very broad details is easy, but a partner or close friend would be curious about the specific details. Do you have any more advice on this?   Not really, it is a way of living. Over time you will be bonding with others without knowing their state names and without they know your state name, its the same thing you will see in other online communities, reddit, gaming, etc. Personally, I think I am able to sense the personality behind an anon profile when enough thoughts and views have been published over time, take for instance the banteg profile.

CodeKnight:  One who uses Discord is vulnerable to a Discord issue leaking information.   Agree. Do not discuss any sensitive topics on Discord, these conversations might easily be leaked in one way or another. This includes revealing personal information about you.
