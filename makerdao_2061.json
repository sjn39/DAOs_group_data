To kick-things-off in the New Year, we sit down with Retro of MakerDAO\u2019s CES ( Collateral Engineering Services) Core Unit and discussed the operational hurdles that DAOs encounter, as well as defining Maker\u2019s EndGame Constitution. We really enjoyed discussing many MakerDAO topics with Retro, as well as reviewing our favorite Drinks and hope you take time to enjoy this discussion to kickoff 2023.
