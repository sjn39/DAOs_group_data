Specification  Motivation I have worked as Deputy Facilitator for Immunefi Security since its inception on Dec 2021 and, during part of its incubation period under SES, two month prior (Oct and Nov 2021). I have taken charge of the accounting, wrote status updates, and contributed to our core unit\u2019s goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning, but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. Often, when Travin has scheduling conflicts, I am asked to attend the weekly Mandated Actor\u2019s meeting in his place. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo. This proposal is not about compensation. My compensation will actually go down by about 1000 DAI/month because I will no longer be eligible for SourceCred. The main motivation is to become vetted by MKR holders for the high-trust role mandated by our Core Unit.

In multiple instances he\u2019s made decisions and jumped to actions that are either sub-optimal or harmful in a minor way (I believe minor because he\u2019s not had a great deal of responsibility thus far). Some of these have just been baffling, others irritating, and some infuriating. Most recently:   Announcing to delegates that we would be having emergency drills - normally you\u2019d only get to do an emergency drill with zero prior knowledge once, we didn\u2019t get to do that. This also led to multiple delegates believing that an actual minor emergency was a drill.   Publicly posting incorrect delegate response times on the aforementioned minor emergency after I asked him to get me a list of the actual on-chain vote times - something that could have been avoided if he\u2019d just done what I\u2019d asked him to, or had checked with me before posting incorrect information.   Leaking sensitive information on aforementioned minor emergency in the same post - again something that could have been avoided by either doing what I\u2019d actually asked him to do, or checking with me before posting.   Asking for GovAlpha to review a proposal that I believe was meant to bring better nutrition to the DAO - I don\u2019t think was ever posted, and I have trouble remembering the contents because I noped out of it almost immediately when I read the part about running a questionnaire including questions of an extremely personal nature. I bring this up because it baffled me why he\u2019d written it and how it had anything to do with Immunefi, it also baffled me that he thought anyone in crypto-culture would want to fill in a questionnaire about their dietary habits, it further baffled me that he thought it would be something appropriate for GovAlpha to spend time reviewing.   Submitting the Recognized Delegate Compensation MIP without confirming that GovAlpha was happy with it. To be clear, he was under no obligation to do this, but we\u2019d been working on it fairly actively and not being consulted was frustrating.   Posting (since deleted) an extremely half-assed version of a Intangible Asset Request for Immunefi to take ownership of a MakerDAO security repo. Not only was it not a valid on posting, but he\u2019d also neglected to speak to PE, the owners of the repo about transferring it before posting it. When questioned, I asked if he\u2019d done that because he felt the whole process was a waste of time and an example of governance bureaucracy, and he confirmed that yes, that was the reason. If he\u2019d followed the process as written he would have spoken to PE initially and learned that they weren\u2019t comfortable transferring ownership.   In summary (and as pointed out initially), at this point I don\u2019t trust his judgement or decision-making. I\u2019m sure lots of you are more charitable, but I genuinely worry that Joshua will do meaningful damage to the DAO at some point in this role.     CodeKnight:  It\u2019s also not an ad hominem. An ad hominem is an attack on a person to discredit his argument. This is an attack on a person to discredit the person.   Quick note on this, I didn\u2019t and don\u2019t want this to be seen as an attack on Joshua, that why I was initially very succinct. You\u2019re more or less correct though, the argument Joshua is making is that\u2019s he should be onboarded as a facilitator - the argument is the person in this case.     LongForWisdom:  I\u2019m not going to discuss or debate this position beyond this post in public or in private.   Want to just point out that I\u2019m not going to spend time sourcing these or attempting to prove any of this beyond reasonable doubt. My sense of personal responsibility was satisfied by my first post. This is already way more detail than I wanted to provide, and I\u2019ve only done so due to a combination of Joshua saying he\u2019s fine with it, and because of @ChrisBlec repeatedly @'ing me despite my making it very clear I didn\u2019t intend to discuss it further.

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  Can @TravinImmunefi share more about your thought on @psychonaut 's proposal?   Hello, I apologize for my late reply here. I was the one who encouraged the application of @psychonaut in order for him to be better able to represent IS-001 during calls given my restrictive schedule. Under the description of the Deputy Facilitator role mentioned in MIP39c2-SP24: Adding Immunefi Security Core Unit - IS-001, the details of the role can be found here. One of the key aspects of the role 3-6 months in, which has already passed, is to: \u201cAct as a representative of the CU to the Maker community in community channels and engage in external cryptocurrency channels as substitute for the Facilitator when needed\u201d Feedback was provided that Joshua substituting for me on the Mandated Actors calls so much was not appropriate, but unfortunately with changes to my personal family life, the time of the call, especially with how it is now with daylight savings, is not something I can comfortably do, though I pushed to join the calls over the past months after it was called out, aside from a few emergency cases and times I was OOO (like next week). I am also not a significant member on that call and thus I did not feel it to be right to request a time change and thus making everyone move their schedule. This issue prompted the suggestion of Joshua becoming a Facilitator as he is unable to perform all the duties necessary of the role I described unless he gets the Facilitator role. Joshua has already attended about half of the MA calls (it\u2019s why it got pointed out as a problem) and has been diligent in taking notes and communicating things to me. I understand that LongForWisdom doesn\u2019t wish to discuss further the points he brought up, and I\u2019ll respect that. Instead, I\u2019ll endorse Joshua for the good work that he has done. The launch and the subsequent operation of IS-001 was not exactly as smooth as we had hoped. There were (and are) changes at Immunefi that made things a bit more difficult for us to deliver. As the first and only client of Immunefi that has any of these services, we were entering some level of experimentation, though granted we had hoped to leverage these in potential future services for other clients. That has not materialized, though that\u2019s outside of the scope of this. Joshua throughout this time has been proactive in figuring out ways to help as well as get his \u201chands dirty\u201d and do the work necessary. For example, we\u2019re in the process of restructuring our triaging process for the bug bounty program, and Joshua has stepped up to provide the necessary triaging assistance on call especially while I\u2019m away. He\u2019s always been communicative with me and I have had no issues with his communication, as well as took a proactive stance whenever he felt I was late on things or found things that would make things more secure. I\u2019ve also significantly underestimated the amount of work I needed to do as a Facilitator, both in the frontloading and in the maintenance of the core unit, and Joshua being around and helping, as well as proactively figuring out what he could take from me, and thus do better since I was extremely overloaded, even with last-minute requests, was really a life-saver. I will clarify though with regards to the statement about leaking sensitive information since this is something significant especially for IS-001. From our side, what was considered sensitive was not what was posted by Joshua and it\u2019s not what I or Immunefi requested to keep confidential temporarily. I understand that at the time there was some confusion about what was asked to be kept confidential, but I want to clarify that what Joshua posted did not fall under it. There were some minor mistakes that Joshua made, but he worked with me to make it right. He\u2019s also very transparent about them and we had them listed on our monthly updates. Had these been major mistakes, I would have withheld this recommendation, but they are not. ",
