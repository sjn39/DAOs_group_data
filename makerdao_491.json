I saw some desire in the forum to participate and make an impact, and this may be a great opportunity to collaborate (sponsorships are also available). DAOists.xyz intends this as a xDAO initiative, so love to look at ways we can work together to make the inaugural DAODenver a huge success. We have a great venue and we\u2019re lining up incredible speakers. Does MakerDAO have speakers or sessions DAO members would like to put forward? https://daodenver2022.eventbrite.com ",
