                    "content": "Hey all, After releasing LINK-A, YFI-A and ETH & WBTC proposed Liquidations 2.0 parameters we are proposing the next batch of Liq 2.0 parameters for the remaining smaller vault types. These are the last remaining non-UNI LP vault types to have Liq 2.0 implemented:  UNI-A ZRX-A AAVE-A BAT-A RENBTC-A LRC-A MANA-A COMP-A KNC-A BAL-A  Again, the only parameter where we propose a different value from the start is ilk.hole, which is the maximum amount of pending liquidations for a particular vault type. Input for selecting this value is based on the latest on-chain slippage curves for assets backing Maker\u2019s loan portfolio, which can be found here. As in all previous proposals, we aim to equal ilk.hole value with about 4-5% on-chain slippage figure obtained from on-chain slippage curves mentioned above. Liquidations 2.0 parameters (same for all vault types): cut = 0.99 step = 90 seconds buf = 1.30 cusp = 0.4 tail = 140 minutes chip = 0.1% tip = 0 ilk.chop = 13% tolerance = 0.5 Global Auction Parameter: hole = 100m DAI Ilk.hole parameters: UNI-A ilk.hole = 5.0m DAI ZRX-A ilk.hole = 1.0m DAI AAVE-A ilk.hole = 5.0m DAI BAT-A ilk.hole = 1.5m DAI RENBTC-A ilk.hole = 3.0m DAI LRC-A ilk.hole = 0.5m DAI MANA-A ilk.hole = 1.0m DAI COMP-A ilk.hole = 2.0m DAI KNC-A ilk.hole = 0.5m DAI BAL-A ilk.hole = 3.0m DAI ",
