For instance, if a LP provider is no longer in range, it would be useful to have an option to notify a user to deposit more tokens to ensure their V3 LP position to be in range. There is no formal mechanism similar to how \u201cmargin calls\u201d work, i.e., how brokers inform clients to ensure they have enough margin ratio, or risk liquidation. ",
