Currently, I have invested in Defi and NFT for nearly a year and a half. Including the stock market investment, it\u2019s been more than 10 years, but I think it\u2019s a separate part, so I\u2019ll move on. Anyway, most of the interest in Defi and NFT in the Korean community has declined. However, due to APT and HFT, the interest in WEP3, or airdrop, is very high. So everyone is trying to find this information. I heard that OP is also doing airdrop for the second season, but I think this is the best time to promote it. Why don\u2019t you start promoting it in person rather than wanting people to visit you in person? Assign a certain amount of airdrop to people who collaborate with the community or post quality promotional articles. The coin market is dead, but WEP3, I think the Airdrop market is an opportunity to spread even bigger!! Let\u2019s take the opportunity and make the OP the best. ",
