Available globally, Customers from around the world will be able to buy their items in their preferred currency, including Dai. Maker has a reputation for creating some of the most in-demand swag in DeFi. Event booths were regularly swarmed by enthusiasts looking for Maker and Dai-branded items. Creating the \u201cMakerDAO Shop\u201d on MakerDAO.com offers a direct way for people to purchase merchandise directly from the project while also getting the Maker and Dai logos into broader circulation. It\u2019s also a valuable resource for partners, event organizers, and Core Unit teams looking for branded promotional items to use in their various programs. Infrastructure for the store is already in place, so the shop could be up and running in a matter of days should the MIP be approved.
