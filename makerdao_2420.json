                    "content": "Rune has said on reddit that there is essentially no legal risk because of the careful diligence that will go into the on-boarding of new collateral types in MCD. However he has said that there could be political risk. Some have suggested that we can avoid this through diversification. My question is how will diversification even matter if most countries are allied with the USA? If the USA tells their allies to stop allowing collateral to be used in MCD they will simply comply and this could pose a threat to the stability of DAI. (If the legal structure i.e. SPVs around collateral are deemed null and void by the regulatory authorities in that nation). The only solution I can think of is to onboard collateral in:  China Russia Iran Maybe Lebanon  So my final question is, has the Maker Foundation teams pursued Business Development efforts in these jurisdictions?
