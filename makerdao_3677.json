It was a large sum around 9k, I can see the transaction was processed and is showing up on the balance viewable on etherscan. https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf09029781c5f47170b1b9019583cd25d40612f81797e31d8c90ff6144acb6173 Is there anyway to have the USDT returned or tokens burned and reminted? Just looking for some help or someone to point me in the right direction. Thanks -Cory ",

Thanks   Contact the USDT team, on their website they have a support email for these cases, I know a friend who sent USDT to a contract address directly, and he contacted USDT, presented proof that it was his wallet and they refunded him the USDT in a couple of days.
