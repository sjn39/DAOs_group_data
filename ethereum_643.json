Megan has come up with a couple of questions / topics to cover:  Financial Reporting v. Tax Reporting What metrics can you use to manage your crypto treasury? Crypto bookkeeping best practices Accounting edge cases - (hard forks, air drops)  See the HackMD file to add your own questions and for all the notes and content for the event.  About Megan Megan\u2019s professional experience and personal interests revolve around building efficient systems. Megan is the founder of VeriLedger, a project that is working to streamline bookkeeping and financial reporting for crypto-enabled businesses. Prior to founding VeriLedger, Megan was an early member of a cryptocurrency agency brokerage project out of ConsenSys. Before that, she consulted with a venture capital firm focused on making investments in the blockchain ecosystem as well as worked at an AmLaw 100 firm in financial operations. She wants to make financial management and transparency easier for companies.  Megan volunteered to help out the Magicians with finance in this Github issue. @Flash is helping us out, but we\u2019re happy to have advisors with specific expertise like this. You can also see a long back and forth about DAI, ETH, conversions, and how DAI CDPs work here. ",

                    "content": "Thanks everyone for dialing in and joining @meknab (find her on Twitter as @knotmegan) and myself today. I learned a lot, and appreciate Megan taking the time. The video capture is here https://zoom.us/recording/share/wOxdfH5gQymvG_6ed6oE4ESDH1afk6JykBy0Oa3EyOywIumekTziMw I live typed some rough notes as Megan was talking in the HackMD file \u2013 I\u2019ve pasted in those notes here so we have a permanent record. Megan shared a budget variance spreadsheet template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OzM7xu1ss9JJCT5hscIdm_f7QYoT4DMBVCpEZr76Cmg/edit?usp=sharing (File > Make a Copy for your own version). I previously shared a cashflow / budget template that I use:     Discussing Long Term Cashflow and Budgets for Ethereum Projects, Teams, and Individuals Primordial Soup       TL;DR: Here is a template for planning out cashflow and budgets for projects. Let\u2019s use these to have a discussion about sustainability, the complexity & need for some global  entities, and how to work together and improve all of this.   For our own work at SPADE in getting support for ERC1066 and the rest of FISSION Suite, and our new project around EVM Evolution, I modified a set of cashflow / budget planning spreadsheets that I\u2019ve used to support new startups. It\u2019s a vastly simplified version\u2026     For \u201cregular\u201d accounting, we mentioned a \u201ccommand line accounting tool\u201d http://furius.ca/beancount/. Personally I use and have recommended Xero https://xero.com for multi-currency. @serapath on Twitter recommended Wave https://waveapps.com (Canadian company, they are good for sole proprietorship / small businesses) and QuickFile https://www.quickfile.co.uk/ (UK businesses) CoinGeck has historical USD / ETH prices https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum/historical_data/usd#panel \u2013 what other sources of historical price data? For different currency pairs, eg CAD, EUR, etc.? For EthMagicians, this is my rough TO DO that I\u2019ll turn into Github Issues:  multisig additions \u2013 adding AT LEAST a third person (@Flash) and do 2 of 3 write down policy for expenses  going back paying Boris back for Berlin while applying policy of cost of ETH at that time   2018 \u201cbooks\u201d \u2013 look back at actuals budget  per event budget we have one for Paris are we doing two more events this year?   open collective - further thoughts on how this interacts as fiscal sponsor  Megan will be at ETHDenver in the Business Models ring \u2013 see ETH Denver Magicians Applications and Gatherings Find out more about Megan\u2019s startup Veriledger https://veriledger.io/  Notes Budget v actual analysis template https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OzM7xu1ss9JJCT5hscIdm_f7QYoT4DMBVCpEZr76Cmg/edit?usp=sharing High volume & categorizing transactions is a big pain for accounting Talked to a lot of people, nothing quite ready Talked to accounting firms about outsourcing \u2013 not that many accountants / book keepers that know anything Also expensive Concept of Veriledger \u2013 automate super simple accounting procedures \u2013 take in data, GAAP standards, international accounting standards Normal non-crypto, lots of software for automating biz process \u2013 lots doesn\u2019t in crypto Not technical \u2013 accounting person Veriledger \u2013 integrating Exchanges and pulling data off of Ethereum  not just value of portfolio, but simple General Ledger stuff creating financial statements running a budget release in April  Crypto Book-keeping 101 Chart of accounts  Before Quickbooks etc. actual journals kept most enter in general ledger assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses first three are balance sheet \u2013 other are income statements PNL for Proft and Loss  Find templates online Using QB or Xero Megan has a template \u2013 can share Chart of Accounts won\u2019t fit business perfectly Nature of operations \u2013 level of granularity What is your business doing?
