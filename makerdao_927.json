Must be some CDP manually closed in scd and reopened in mcd or there is any \u201cauthomatic\u201d transition path without owner\u2019s action? Will be any stability fee debts \u201ctransferred\u201d from open CDPs from scd to mcd too or it becomes reseted? Must be the accumulated stability fee paid at some point in \u201ctransition\u201d process or it becomes transferred \u201csmoothly\u201d?  thank you! ",
