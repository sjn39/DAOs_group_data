                    "content": "I have been working on a single overview diagram that provides all major details related to the Metanomics and the broader economic equilibrium and governance equilibrium of the endgame state. The starting point is to chart the economic equilibrium by following the value flows of the Metanomics and their second order effects, and then explain each piece step by step. It\u2019s a work in progress but I\u2019m posting the latest version here and will keep it updated as I finish it over this week. Feedback is welcome! The biggest change to the Metanomics is that the central parameter of the Base Metanomics which determines the amount of permanent, immutable MKR emissions has been increased from 50000 to 65000 - this is based on updated information about the current concentration of the MKR distribution. MKR emissions is the only effective and secure way to deal with this challenge in the long term - by increasing it further the effect of irreversibly decentralizing the voter base will happen earlier. Of the 65000, 60000 goes to Meta Elixir accumulation, and 5000 goes to new MetaDAO incubation and decentralized workforce MKR bonuses. Right now these posts assume knowledge of the Stances and the MetaDAO classes, however a full introduction to all concepts will be added up front in the future.  MetaDAO tokens  MetaDAO tokens are the central tool of Metanomics. They\u2019re used to direct the economic focus and flow of value in the ecosystem, while gathering aligned communities for the MetaDAOs. This is a crucial element of a MetaDAOs success, as the community collaborates to govern and grow them by taking advantage of the opportunities that exist in the free market of the Maker Ecosystem and the broader DeFi economy   Base Metanomics  Base Metanomics emits 60000 MKR per year to accumulate Liquidity-Provider tokens of MKR against MetaDAO tokens (\u201cMeta Elixir\u201d) This core value flow allows the MetaDAO tokens to retain their value even when widely distributed through yield farmed   The primary 3 yield farming value flows  ex21043\u00d7637 120 KB  MetaDAO tokens are distributed via yield farming to Dai, ETH and MKR users These value flows are then recaptured back to Maker and MKR through several positive-sum \u201cloops\u201d that together make up the Endgame economic equilibrium   The ETH Metanomics Core Loop  ex4751\u00d7936 107 KB  The Endgame Plan recognizes the importance of Ethereum as the best scalable decentralized collateral and introduces a new Staked ETH product: EtherDai (ETHD) - built on top of Lido Staked ETH. The Metanomics value flowing to ETHD vaults is recaptured via Stability Fees while also bootstrapping ETHD adoption   The Maker Burn Engine  ex5751\u00d7936 161 KB  The Maker Burn Engine is an advanced feature of the Endgame Plan It accumulates Elixir, which is an LP token that synergizes with ETHD by boosting its liquidity, helping its adoption When MKR is cheap it uses the Elixir to burn MKR in bursts   The ETH Metanomics MetaDAO Loops  ethmetadaoloops938\u00d71424 218 KB  The ETHD MetaDAO loops enable further positive-sum value creation based on the ETHD yield farming   All MetaDAOs can earn revenue share on yield-farmable ETHD Vaults by growing the user base   In Eagle and Phoenix, RWA income grows when decentralized collateral grows     The Protocol Owned Vault(POV)  pov11103\u00d71593 274 KB  The Protocol Owned Vault(POV) is a core element of the Endgame.

When developed, MKR holders can lock their MKR behind a 15% unlock fee in return for much higher MetaDAO token yield and low cost Dai generation. The unlock fee is a revenue share source for MetaDAO governance frontends   The MetaDAO Core Metanomics  meta111920\u00d71278 158 KB  The value flows to MetaDAOs from Dai, ETH and MKR Metanomics are accumulated as Elixir:   The relative amount of Elixir of each MetaDAO determines their share of the 60000 MKR emissions   MetaDAO tokens are burnt if the accumulated Elixir exceeds the MetaDAO market cap   \u2013  The MetaDAO Independent Business Models  meta211101\u00d71808 155 KB  MetaDAOs specialize through independent business models There\u2019s no limit to how they can innovate - they can build new products and features for their users and form advanced supply chains Maker provides the foundation for this free market by enforcing agreements and standards   The Metanomics meta flows  meta31920\u00d71568 231 KB  The concept of meta covers all of the second order effects that impact a DAO, including community culture, brand, governance and economy The broad and diverse token distribution of MetaDAOs helps cluster communities with strong meta that can drive growth and good governance   The MetaDAO internal Metanomics  meta41008\u00d71705 216 KB  MetaDAOs have a feature similar to the Homeworld Engine: NFT Staking. Users lock up their MDAO, turning them into a NFT that can later be exchanged back to MDAO. While NFT Staking users benefit from 5% supply emissions per year, but pay an unlock fee of 15%.

Not sure I really understand this question but to some extent the whole point of a MetaDAO is to \u201cfarm group morale into existence\u201d although that is a very simplified way to put it. The idea is that only those who actually identify with the existing meta/culture/brand of the MetaDAO will hold on to the tokens, and thus the communities will become self-selecting and be able to create an aligned and tight knit small community that is interacting closely with a small team that also is aligned on the same values and meta. Instead of everyone having to get along in a huge top down structure, you have many smaller groups that operate within a set of objective incentives and opportunities that treat everyone equally, making the focus to perform rather than politick, and a key to successful performance will be a healthy, good and stable meta of the MetaDAOs.

So now is it more accurate to say that MetaDAOs are required to buy MKR? Or will Maker buy tokens/MetaElixir on the open market? More generally, what is the minting process and (at least relative) valuation process for MetaElixir?   So there have been some updates to some of these parameters, but let me try to quickly explain it. Basically, MetaDAOs acquire Elixir (benefitting Maker), and Maker acquires Meta Elixir (benefitting MetaDAOs). Maker emits 65000 MKR in total per year, with 60k of that going to Meta Elixir acquisition and 5k used for discretionary purposes (paying workforce bonuses or incubating new MetaDAOs) The 70%/30% split of MetaDAO surplus has been removed - now the MetaDAO just buys Elixir with all of its surplus and if it wants to invest or trade etc it takes assets directly from its surplus buffer to do so. Protectors have a special tokenomics rule that does give them a 70/30 split, with 30% of their surplus used to buy \u201ccentralization insurance\u201d by providing an ROI to people who deposit ETHD with them for some period of time - this insurance then pays out if the collateral is seized or the Protectors suffers losses due to mismanagement of risk. And the Elixir and Meta Elixir is, in the long run, accumulated from a backend feature called The Well, which is basically a pool that market makes Elixir/Meta Elixir against the component tokens. This is because Elixir/Meta Elixir will eventually become a multichain basket of multiple LP tokens, rather than just a single uniswap or balancer pool token - this way Maker ensures strong liquidity in all of the key tokens on all major L2s where it is strategically important to have good liquidity.

As usual you can find these, in progress and finalized, on the community\u2019s file/figjam. It\u2019s worth reiterating, some of this feedback I agree with, other pieces I\u2019m not so sure, and other pieces I haven\u2019t made up my mind. I\u2019m stewarding this as best I can.  Most high-level feedback Like most things in Endgame, the execution plan is critical for success and it\u2019s still not clear. These diagrams are a great tool and have made great progress. That being said the most critical details:  A step by step implementation plan Token mint(s) Distribution (wasn\u2019t there an airdrop to do?) Yield farming still unclear ( what\u2019s the yield formula? ) Sale, if any, and follow-on effects Emissions ETH acquisition strategies + how they map and balance out within the economic system.

So, if growth or a frontend is a solution\u2026 probably pick at clarification urge more.  Topical Questions Markets, bootstrapping, tokens, and risks  Who is buying these tokens versus earning them? What are the distinctions between tokenomics in different MetaDAOs? Are the MDAO tokens akin to ICO\u2019s at all? How and where does value accrue? (e.g., vault revenue) Do tokens still command the attention they once did? It\u2019s not 2017 anymore, tokens (+) is more powerful meta. What if DeFi exchanges themselves get attacked and liquidity drained?  Meta-eco-nomics  How many mdao tokens can go to zero before affecting all of them or risking the system? Limit order staircases might get filled ( or sandwiched)  Financial modeling  We need modeling of MetaDAO Economic CashFlows to find places where inflation, dilution, distribution, emissions, and work unite or clash. Especially clashing incentives.  Can we complete a fundamental valuation for a Pro-forma Metadao?  Modeling could proxy the value of metadao tokens and most of the economic questions.    Vault clarifiers  Where do user-controlled vaults fit into metanomics What is the process of adopting vaults? How does the revenue flow work? (adopted vs. new)  ",

                    "content": "    twblack88:  wasn\u2019t there an airdrop to do?   Currently I\u2019ve removed the possibility of an airdrop from the design as I think it would result in too much high-stakes politics. The anti-reflexivity mechanic which ensures billions of MetaDAO tokens will be for sale right from genesis takes over the role of preventing broken price discovery.     twblack88:  Yield farming still unclear ( what\u2019s the yield formula? )   The formula is 20% of MetaDAO yield farming goes to Dai farms, 40% to ETHD vault debt, and 40% to MKR holders (later split into 20% to regular delegators and additional 20% exclusively to those locked into the Homeworld Engine, once the Homeworld Engine has been developed sometime in the Midgame which will likely take around 3 years) The MetaDAOs emit 1 billion tokens per year for the first 2 years, and from there it halves every 2 years until it stops at year 10. Then the 3.75% permanent emissions take over and continue the yield farming forever (counterbalancing the permanent 60k MKR emissions that benefit the MetaDAOs)  image1035\u00d7883 158 KB  To spell it out further with an example: If you have 1000 dai, and there are 99000 dai already farming a particular metadao token during year 1, then if you start farming you will have 1% of the total actively farming dai. This means you will get 1% of the MetaDAO token yield, or 1% of 100 million tokens, meaning 1 million tokens per year, or about 80000 MDAO per month. This applies the same if you are farming with ETHD Vaults (where the metric to compare is total debt of your vault), or delegated MKR     twblack88:  Who is buying these tokens versus earning them?   The buyers of MetaDAO tokens would likely be people who specifically identify with the meta developed of a particular MetaDAO, who will be willing to buy them and participate in governance and the community if the token is fairly valued. It is likely that a lot buying would come from Maker Core itself though, and most MetaDAO token holders will be farmers who choose not to sell rather than actively buy it.     twblack88:   What are the distinctions between tokenomics in different MetaDAOs?    This is still being developed and is one of the most important parameters to get right during the pregame since it will be practically impossible to change after the launch of MetaDAOs and distribution of tokens. This is the latest design which I have updated just recently alongside the increased MKR emissions with a new approach to clean money, charity and purpose and how it relates to developing and stabilizing the meta of Maker and the MetaDAOs. All MetaDAOs permanently emit the following tokens per year:  6% to NFT staking (Homeworld/sagittarius engine equivalent for MetaDAOs) 2.75% to Maker farms (Dai, ETHD, MKR) 1% to workforce bonus pool 0.25% to charity pool 5% to drizzle engine if the drizzle engine contains less than 10% of total supply  The percentages are calculated from total circulating supply, which does not count the contents of the workforce bonus pool, the drizzle engine, or unsold tokens in the anti-reflexivity mechanic, but it likely should count the 2 billion genesis yield farm tokens that have not yet been distributed (will need more input on this). 100% of MetaDAO surplus is used to accumulate Elixir, which then determines their share of the Base Metanomics Emissions of 60000 MKR - this replaces the earlier 70/30 split where a portion of surplus was required to be invested into other assets than Elixir (but this turned out to be impossible to regulate properly) Special rules for MetaDAO classes: Creators: Creators have no special tokenomics rules and they apply as above Protectors: Protectors only accumulate Elixir with 70% of their surplus, the other 30% is used to provide returns for Phoenix Staking, which is a form of junior capital staking where users deposit ETHD in time locked smart contracts and then receive additional yield on top of the ETH staking yield. In return they take 50% of the first loss risk on RWA exposure by the Protectors, and lose all of their ETH if Maker enters Phoenix Stance. Governors: The 0.25% to charity pool is instead used to increase the NFT staking yield to 6.25%. This is to make the Governor tokenomics more attractive by encouraging more long term holders and governance participants, and also because the Governors will have a conflict of interest as they will be regulating the use of the charity pool funds by the MetaDAOs through running the Ecosystem Tribunal. Governors can of course still do charity/marketing spending but it will be voluntary and done through their Surplus Buffer.     twblack88:   Are the MDAO tokens akin to ICO\u2019s at all?    No, since an ICO is sold rather than farmed, and it is also managed from genesis by a core team. A MetaDAO is farmed by a community, which becomes the founding core of the MetaDAO, and this community then onboards a cluster after bootstrapping through the yield farming. The launch MetaDAO will by necessity have a more streamlined process for this where there is exactly one cluster per MetaDAO, but for later MetaDAOs the expectation is that there will be multiple competinng clusters for each new MetaDAO and as a result the MetaDAOs will be truly defined by the genesis community rather than a team.     twblack88:   How and where does value accrue? (e.g., vault revenue)    This picture is best place to see all of the value flows. There are 6 arrows from the various core frontends and products: Dai frontend, Decentralized Collateral Lending Engine, RWA Frontend (Synergizing with Dai adoption in Pigeon Stance), Vault Frontend, RWA Frontend (Synergizing with decentralized collateral growth in Eagle/Phoenix Stance) and governance frontend In addition there are the infinite possibility for additional revenue streams from the Independent Business Models that are up to each MetaDAO to develop based on its specialization.  image1920\u00d71568 223 KB      twblack88:  Do tokens still command the attention they once did? It\u2019s not 2017 anymore, tokens (+) is more powerful meta.   The old ponzi approach tokens has certainly gotten stale, what\u2019s missing is a way to tie together the meta engineering of advanced tokenomics (provided by Metanomics) with actual solid and sane business models (provided by Maker Core and the decentralized workforce) while preventing destructive bubbles (ensured with the anti-reflexivity mechanic)     twblack88:   What if DeFi exchanges themselves get attacked and liquidity drained?    We obviously shouldn\u2019t use insecure DEXes, but stick with balancer and uniswap. Longer term elixir and meta elixir will also diversify across many different DEXes, which will allow us to take some risk with newer and more experimental DEXes on L2\u2019s.     twblack88:   How many mdao tokens can go to zero before affecting all of them or risking the system?    If we have less than 6 active MetaDAOs then the system becomes at risk of losing critical mass, and enters a kind of emergency mode where the missing MKR emissions that would have gone to meta elixir acquisition is instead all used to incubate new MetaDAOs so the system can return to 6 active MetaDAOs as quickly as possible.     twblack88:  Limit order staircases might get filled ( or sandwiched)   That\u2019s the point of them - if there is a massive price increase in a metadaos token, this price increase will result in a significant accumulation of elixir which means that some of the speculative price action will convert into fundamental value through reserves.     twblack88:  Can we complete a fundamental valuation for a Pro-forma Metadao?  Modeling could proxy the value of metadao tokens and most of the economic questions.    The best way to model the fundamental value of a MetaDAO will be to do a regular P/E or DCF comparison, and then just assume it will be more volatile due to the unpredictable effects of the metanomics.     twblack88:  Where do user-controlled vaults fit into metanomics   The ETHD Vaults (and all other types of vaults) are described in the metanomics diagram, including the flow of stability fees into the surplus buffer, and the frontend revenue share by MetaDAOs.     twblack88:   What is the process of adopting vaults? How does the revenue flow work? (adopted vs. new)    Vault adoption is effectively simulating a D3M. It\u2019s approved through a MIP and allows MetaDAOs to operate vaults (or take over existing vaults) that run on the core vault engine. Instead of getting a revenue share, as they get with the vault frontend approach for the main vaults, such as ETHD, the MetaDAOs earn a spread that they themselves determine, above a MIP-defined cost of capital. In turn the MetaDAOs cover all costs for development, maintenance and oracles, and must manually make adjustments to account for changes in risk. Should there be losses from an adopted vault, the MetaDAO takes first loss with all of its assets, including the ability for Maker to emit new MetaDAO tokens as a backstop if necessary.     twblack88:  What is Meta Elixir and what\u2019s it\u2019s purpose?   Meta Elixir is MKR/MDAO LP tokens (initially UniV2 tokens). Their purpose is to be the target for the Metanomics MKR emissions, and ensure that MetaDAOs are highly liquid, while using MKR as the unit of account and trading currency for MetaDAO traders.     twblack88:  MKR emissions are \u2026printed?   Yes, a fixed, immutable amount of MKR is emitted permanently from the Metanomics. The amount of MKR that\u2019s emitted will eventually equilibrate with the amount of MKR that\u2019s burned on average, creating a circular flow of tokens. Assuming a long run burn rate of 5% the equilibrium would be at a total MKR supply of around 1.4 million MKR, however I think it is likely that the burn rate will be much lower during the growth phase and as a result we could expect the MKR supply to rise higher, and then decrease once growth plateaus. Significantly increasing the MKR supply through a diverse distribution method is a key objective of the Endgame Plan as it is the only direct solution to the problem of token and voter concentration that we face in the short run.     twblack88:  How does an SB serve as protection for all the metadaos?  At ~80M there\u2019s no way we can account for the risk being spun up by new lending activities. which implies that we\u2019ll be filling up the SB for quite some time    Each MetaDAO will have its own surplus buffer and elixir reserves that act as first loss capital, and will only have its MetaDAO Lending Engine scaled up as it increases the amount of junior capital. This reduces the strain on the Maker Core surplus buffer. Overall, the Endgame Plan also has a preference for increased financial risk tolerance in return for a viable path towards full physical resilience and decentralized collateral.     twblack88:  We\u2019re going to need a valuation model formula or its broad strokes  E.g., how do we value the elixir to burn? Is the burn linear? Is it auction based? dss-Kiln etc.)    This will likely be the responsibility of the Finance Scope to determine a reasonable valuation model. One approach could be to use a comparative Surplus to Market Cap ratio model, or a multiple of treasury model. The burn itself works through dss-kiln connected to a backend liquidity pool call The Well that market makes Elixir against Dai and MKR.     twblack88:  Again, how does yield farming generate yield? Is this some inflationary construct or does it come from the SB, treasury or \u2026something else?   The yield farming is of MetaDAO tokens. Each MetaDAO distributes 2 billion genesis tokens when it is created over a period of 10 years. Additionally MetaDAOs permanently emit 2.75% of their total supply per year to distribute to yield farming     twblack88:  What does the metaDAO do with meta-elixir once it\u2019s acquired?   Maker Core acquires Meta Elixir with MKR emissions, while MetaDAOs acquire Elixir. Maker Core simply holds on to the Meta Elixir permanently. Even in a situation where Maker is penalizing the MetaDAO, or the MetaDAO has suffered losses, and there are no others assets to seize, Maker won\u2019t touch the Meta Elixir, and will instead emit as many MetaDAO tokens as necessary to attempt to recover the penalty (this will effectively extract the MKR out of the Meta Elixir, though). If a MetaDAO dies and is fully wound down, the Meta Elixir is burned as it becomes worthless anyway. Because Meta Elixir is an LP token with MKR in it, then Maker will always benefit from holding it if the MetaDAO token increases in the value, even if Maker doesn\u2019t do anything. This is because the value increase of the MetaDAO tokens will automatically flow into MKR as the MDAO component of the Meta Elixir increases in value and the AMM then rebalances, converting MDAO to MKR automatically.     twblack88:  If metaDAOs all have cloned frontends there isn\u2019t much of a point. power laws and first mover advantages exist.   The point of MetaDAOs is to give up on the foolish notion that any and all defi projects should attempt to become the king of the world and figure out a way to appeal to literally every user while dominating every other project. The reality is that different user demographics have different needs and different brands that appeal to them. MetaDAOs attempt to focus on a demographic niche that they can serve exceptionally well, rather than attempt to capture the entire market by focusing on the lowest common denominator with bland design and marketing.     twblack88:  This seems to give a huge advantage to Protectors, a slight advantage to Creators, and a huge disadvantage to governors who can\u2019t go about finding new innovative vault uses   Each MetaDAO class have their own advantages and disadvantages. They may not all be valued equally, and different types of users and community will definitely have different opinions about what they consider more exicting or safer business models - but that\u2019s also not a problem, MetaDAOs don\u2019t have to be equal in value.     twblack88:   POVE just sounds like a treasury. It would be awesome if the humans could barely touch it.    The Protocol Owned Vault Emulation is a manual, MIP driven stand-in for the long term Protocol Owned Vault. In both cases it is a leveraged treasury, the POVE being run through a manual, low tech process. The Protocol Owned Vault will eventually replace it, and will be a fully autonomous smart contract that is regulated through parameters that are adjusted when necessary, rather than manual processes that must be carried out on a monthly basis. The reason why we need to spin up the POVE immediately is so that we can accumulate ETH at the slowest possible pace, minimizing slippage and timing risk.     twblack88:  metaDAOs will need DAI to execute. so if we\u2019re mixing these elements where does the bottom line go?   I don\u2019t understand this question, but all MetaDAOs earn their income in the form of Dai, that they accumulate in the surplus buffer, with the exception of unlock fees from NFT staking and income from MDAO emissions to the drizzle engine, which both go directly to the Elixir Reserves.     twblack88:   Where do we enable a negative rate? Is it triggered to enable eagle stance or is the line fuzzier? * is there a reason we want the floating rate (vox) versus say a PID like the TRFM?    It is activated through a MIP, and in Eagle Stance must be activated if there is too much RWA exposure (but could be left off if decentralized collateral backing organically reaches 75%). In Pigeon stance TRFM could also be activated early due to external reasons. TRFM and vox is generally same thing. To keep things simple we should come up with a new name to describe the exact mechanisms we will use in Eagle Stance that regulates PSM target price and supply ratios. In Phoenix Stance the regulation of the Target Rate should function exactly as it does now in Rai, possibly with a different controller model. ",

This is still one of my fundamental questions about the Endgame Plan. Who, exactly, will want to hold MetaDAO tokens after buying or farming them? Most importantly, why will these tokens have value? The tokenomics from the perspective of anyone wanting to buy or farm MetaDAO tokens seem horrendous (massive ongoing emissions) and I don\u2019t see why you would need MetaDAO tokens to \u201cparticipate in governance and community\u201d.

                    "content": "I will make some examples to try to illustrate it. I think the thing that\u2019s not registering is the effect of MKR emissions being used to accumulate Meta Elixir. First lets have a look at some example numbers for the actual income: Imagine a leading, successful Creator that generates value from frontend rev share, spread from Metadao lending engine, fees from premium features, revenue share from premium features integrated by other MetaDAOs as Plug and Play Protocols, and overhead from service work. It also has an administration team and a protocol team. I\u2019ll provide some example numbers for each of these income sources: Dai MetaDAO yield farming frontend revenue share  1 billion dai TVL 0.1% of total amount per year in revenue share  = 1 million yearly income (risk free) ETHD Vault MetaDAO yield farming + other vaults  500 million total debt with 4% average stability fee (stability fee is boosted due to MetaDAO yield farming value preservation) 0.25% of stability fees  = 5 million yearly income (risk free) Decentralized Collateral Lending Engine  300 million debt 2.5% average spread above cost of capital from Maker  = 7.5 million yearly income (medium risk of taking first loss) Fees from Premium Features such fixed rates exchange  2 billion in yearly volume 0.25% fee per trade  = 5 million per year (risk free) Revenue share from premium features provided as plug and play protocols to other MetaDAOs  3 other protocols at similar size meaning 6 billion yearly volume in total 0.25% fee per trade 30% revenue share to original Creator  = 4.5 million per year (risk free) Overhead from providing smart contract services to Maker, other MetaDAOs and external customers  10 million in budget per year 20% overhead (this is simplified as in practice overhead would be larger, but the contributors would also earn tokens)  = 2 million per year (low risk of providing job security to service team) All this income, most of which is risk free, totals a yearly income of 25 million Dai - that\u2019s about 2x Maker\u2019s current income (which is very low as RWA hasn\u2019t ramped up yet) The MetaDAO also has an administration team of 5 people doing governance, marketing and community management. It also has a smart contract team of 5 people building new premium features for internal use and for other MetaDAOs to integrate as Plug and Play Protocols. Accounting for (significant) overhead we assume each FTE has a cost of 500k per year, making it 5 million in total yearly expenses. That means a 20 million yearly surplus. This yearly surplus is then used to accumulate Elixir with. As the Elixir amount in the Elixir Reserves goes up, it provides a price floor of the MetaDAO token - if the total amount of Elixir exceeds the market cap of the MetaDAO token, the Elixir Reserve starts to slowly burn the MetaDAO token with Elixir. This means that once the MetaDAO token market cap reaches a certain size, the 20 million in yearly profits is effectively transferred to the token holders through a burn mechanism. Additionally, since the MetaDAO has a large Elixir Reserve, we can assume it will be a top MetaDAO and have capped its share of the Metanomics emissions. This means that Maker emits 10k MKR per year to provide liquidity for the MetaDAO token. Lets assume that since there is a MetaDAO at this level of success, the MKR price is higher as it is able to directly yield farm this MetaDAO and others, so lets put it at 2000 Dai That means 20 million worth of MKR is used per year to provide liquidity to the MetaDAO token holders - on top of the 20 million per year in direct burns this totals 40 million of passive and active value transfer to the MetaDAO token. Now lets assume that the Metanomics, the forced accumulation of Elixir and other factors make holders consider the MetaDAO tokens very risky and as a result they expect a \u201cP/E ratio\u201d equivalent of 5 even if there is significant room for growth. At 40 million in value transfer to token holders that would imply a market cap of 200 million. So basically, with this kind of overly simplified model, any time the market cap of the MetaDAO goes below 200 million, people should be willing to buy it or hold it. The reality will be a lot more complex though, and one thing that\u2019s implied with this model is that the MetaDAO already holds 200 million Dai worth of Elixir (since without it, the direct burn from Elixir wouldn\u2019t occur). The Elixir wouldn\u2019t just accumulate there from the 20 million in surplus, it would also accumulate through the drizzle engine, which would emit up to 5% of the total supply per year to sell, so at 200 million market cap that would mean accumulating 10 million additional elixir per year, for a total of 30 million per year The MetaDAO would also accumulate elixir from the unlock fees of NFT Stakers - lets assume 33% of the total token supply stakes, with a 15% unlock fee that results in income equivalent to 5% of the total supply, or a one time additional income of 10 million Dai worth of Elixir. These stakers would also earn a yearly yield of 15%, which means they would break after a bit more than 1 year and earn 15% per year in upside from there. There\u2019s also the anti-reflexivity mechanic to consider. At 200 million Dai market cap, the anti-reflexivity mechanic will have a significant amount of tokens for Elixir as the price increased. I can\u2019t do the exact math on the spot but I think it would be equivalent to about a 33% expansion of the total token supply (counting all 2 billion genesis yield farming tokens as circulating), in return for a total of 16.6% of the total market cap in income. This would result in a total of 33 million Dai of Elixir in one-off income to the Elixir reserve. So this implies that the the MetaDAO would have 43 million in one-off Elixir income (10 million from NFT staking unlock fees and 33 million from anti-reflexivity mechanic) and 30 million in yearly Elixir income (20 million from MetaDAO surplus, and 10 million from drizzle engine) The equilibrium of 200 million Dai worth of Elixir and a 200 million dollar market cap would thus happen after around 5.5 years. This is would be a more successful MetaDAO - just for the sake of the example, to extrapolate from this, in a future scenario 5 years out in the future where MKR is at 2k Dai and the Endgame Plan has been in effect for a while. There would be 12 MetaDAOs in total assuming 6 launch MetaDAOs, followed by 2 governors at year 1 and then 1 creator or protector per year for the next 4 years. I think we could assume there would be 2 MetaDAOs at the high level of success described in this example (200 milllion Market Cap and Elixir Reserves). In addition to those 2, there would be maybe another 2 at a moderate level of success (100 million market cap and Elixir Reserves), and then an additional 4 at a medium-low level of success (50 million market cap and Elixir Reserves), and an additional 4 at a low level of success (25 million market cap and Elixir Reserves). This implies a total Elixir supply of 800 million Dai, just from the MetaDAOs - Maker Core would also hold a large amount of Elixir, probably at least 200 million. So that would put the total amount of captive MKR liquidity at 1 billion or half of the 2 billion market cap, which should be more than enough to sustain the 70k yearly MKR emissions from Metanomics at a market cap of 2 billion (in practice these numbers are definitely off, as the MKR price would likely be forced higher in a scenario with so much captive liquidity). Last thing to calculate, just for added color, is that after 5 years the total MKR supply would be 1,350,000, for a yearly dilution of 5%. This means that, assuming the 2 billion market cap (which we can assume is low enough that the burn engine will kick in), Maker Core will require a P/E ratio equivalent of 20 to sustain its supply at this level and have no net dilution. That\u2019s equivalent to 100 million in surplus per year, or 10 billion dai supply with an average stability fee of 2%, and 100 million Dai worth of workforce expenses - numbers that are IMO not hard to assume will be possible from the massive demand boost that the MetaDAO yield farming of the 12 MetaDAOs will provide to Dai demand and ETHD Vault stability fees.

That\u2019s one of the biggest selling points of web3 and DeFi. As far as I understand, in the current version of the Endgame Metanomics <10% of value goes to the creators-members of the MetaDAO decentralised workforce, which admittedly leverages Maker\u2019s infrastructure, but takes up risks of cutting-edge opportunities. Yes, there are salaries, but by design the bulk of long term value is in the MetaDAO tokens.    Endgame Plan v3 complete overview   MetaDAO Tokens are simple ERC20 tokens that are controlled by the Maker Pause Proxy. Their initial supply is 4.6 billion (For long term MetaDAOs beyond the 6 Launch MetaDAOs this is 4.5 billion).      Endgame Plan v3 complete overview   400 million MetaDAO tokens are sent to the MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pools, where they are controlled by MetaDAO token governance to provide attractive bonus incentives for the bootstrapping clusters. The long term MetaDAOs receive only 300 million MetaDAO tokens into the MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pool, but the 6 launch MetaDAOs are provided an additional 100 million to help facilitate the Endgame Plan Launch   Isn\u2019t it similar to the situation when ~100% of value created in the Facebook ecosystem goes to Facebook (now ironically Meta) shareholders? That\u2019s kinda worrisome from the incentives POV and the overall Maker trajectory. ",

                    "content": "This is an interesting and important point. The whole point of a MetaDAO is that it is nothing without its community, and that active token holders are a powerful force and critical resource without which e.g. the team is unable to produce value since they provide governance security, innovation and creativity, and most importantly marketing, word of mouth, excitement and traction, and in the attention economy of the future these are the things that matter the most when it comes to survival and competition. So basically I would say that in this analogy the creators are the token holders, and the team is the platform which amplifies and structures the value created by the creators. ",
