                    "content": " TL;DR I have been in favor of 0-PSM-fees to provide a hardened peg since the introduction of the PSM. I am now convinced that this was a mistake as this policy removes the incentive for normal vault holders to arbitrage on depegging and by that just leaving the leverage-usecase for vault holders. As the appetite for leveraging crypto is not very strong, we have reached a stablecoin ratio of ~80% recently - turning DAI more and more into a USDC-wrapper.  Rethinking PSM-fees For those not having an idea what PSMs are - here is a great summary. I\u2019d like to focus on the two parameters defining the fees:   tin - the percentage fee applied when trading a stablecoin (USDC, GUSD, USDP) in exchange for DAI  tout the percentage fee applied when trading DAI against a stablecoin.  Trading DAI back to another stablecoin is of course only possible if there is enough of it deposited on our side - which is not too much of an issue as we have 3.3B of USDC and almost 500 MM of USDP in our PSMs. Both parameters are set to 0, allowing trades into both directions without any conversion fees. Last changes on tin: Signal Request, Onchain Poll, Executive vote - last changes on tout: Signal Request, Onchain Poll, Executive Vote As soon as DAI is depegging to the north - let\u2019s say trading at $ 1.01 - anyone can easily arb this by converting their USDC to DAI and selling it with a premium. As there is no fee on our side, this does happen really quickly. If we would have a fee of 1%, using the PSM would only be profitable, if the price of DAI is > $1.01. Between $1.00 and $1.01 the only way to arb it is to mint DAI using real collateral. As we have zero fees on the PSM, the only use case for native crypto vaults is to leverage your collateral - the appetite for leveraging crypto collateral seems to be at an all time low, the only metric growing on DAI is the stablecoin-ratio (currently at a record 80%). Vault usage is going down more and more. If this trend continues DAI will (slowly) turn into a stablecoin wrapper. If we would increase the tin just a bit, we could re-enable the arbitrage use case for crypto-vault holders. This will very likely not happen really quickly, as there is a lot of e.g. DAIUSDC liquidity on other platforms like curve and uniswap that will be used first. But over time, it will be attractive again to arb the peg just by using crypto vaults again and the PSM will remain as a last-resort peg-stability-enforcer. Increasing the spread also opens up the market for liquidity outside of the Maker Protocol, right now since you can trade 1:1 we\u2019re the primary market for DAI/USDC trades. By opening a window between 1 and 1.01 we\u2019re allowing the market to find a price between there.  Next steps I\u2019d like to use this thread to gauge sentiment about increasing the tin again - if successful I will start a Signal Request on that topic in a couple of days. I would be happy to get comments, additional perspectives and also roasting if this idea is stupid. Moving away from 0-fee PSMs will likely have some effects that should be taken into consideration: what is the impact on RWA, GUNI\u2026 Happy to hear your thoughts ",

My perspective about the implementation of PSM-Fees is that it may not be the best timing, given that MIP65 is up for voting right now. If the proposal passes, the investment of 0-PSM-fees will be realized in NII via bond investing. Implementing PSM may increase volatility and impact stability of funds, which is an important variable for the PSM investable amount - Modeling DAI maturity. The stablecoin ratio is too high and although driving PSM funds down would lead to a better stablecoin ratio, the focus should be on driving lending demand, MKR\u2019s core business. I have opened up an informal poll post to ideate on incentives to increase DAI borrowing.     ultraschuppi:  As soon as DAI is depegging to the north - let\u2019s say trading at $ 1.01 - anyone can easily arb this by converting their USDC to DAI and selling it with a premium.

                    "content": "The following opinions my own and do not represent PECU Setting the PSM fees to zero has played out pretty much exactly the way that many of us had predicted. Michael from Curve warned even before the PSM was implemented that market price discovery for Dai is necessary and that setting the fees to 1:1 would cause \u201cempty shelves\u201d in secondary markets by attempting to price fix at the protocol level. I warned prior to the imposition of the zero fee tin that Maker holders would expect to take on many multiples more stables than we had backing Dai, and that\u2019s indeed what has happened, to the point where we\u2019re at a laughable 80% stablecoin backing for Dai. By attempting to stomp down the market premium for Dai we\u2019ve disincentivized vault usage generally, which is and should be the protocol\u2019s bread and butter as sticky revenue. By not allowing the market to price in a premium to Dai when it is in demand there is less incentive to generate new Dai via collateral vaults. Without the ability to apply variable rates to sop up Dai on the downside of the peg none of the other strategic money games work. Swapping bonds with Circle on the backend is not an interesting defi primitive nor is it one that I think people will get excited to support Maker over. The original desire for reducing the fees to zero apparently stemmed from a desire to ensure Dai could be purchased at $1 by Dai holders. This is not something we should optimize for. The MakerDAO White Paper describes Dai as \u201ccollateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar.\u201d This soft-peg is critically important to the long-term stability of the token as the price fluctuates to represent market sentiment. High Dai price means high demand, and encourages Dai generation, it also discourages and should discourage repayments, which would take Dai out of circulation. Conversely, Dai below peg discourages new vaults and means that borrowers can buy Dai at a discount and repay debt, thus reducing supply and driving the price up. At scale, we can expect that by allowing these market incentives to play out as intended market participants will naturally play both sides of the peg and keep the token price on track. By removing this critical market signal we\u2019ve eliminated the ability for market participants to grow in a healthy and sustainable way. Instead, we\u2019ve provided nominal Dai price stability at the cost of existential risk to the protocol without any reward to MKR holders. It\u2019s time to declare this experiment with zero fees a failure and begin to allow the protocol to heal by embracing the innate incentives of the system. The PSM in and of itself is a compromise to those incentives, but in the long term, a PSM with zero fees interferes too much with the systemic feedback mechanisms that keep the system upright. ",

IIRC the gas cost for PSM is much higher compared to a simple swap on uniswap, hence I think it is not used much by small retail in the first place. Do correct me if I am wrong on this. If people want to swap in general there is now a 0.01% fee USDC/DAI pool that has very high amount of liquidity, and already incentivized by the protocol to be used as collateral. PSM should be used as its name, a peg stability module. Large players use the PSM as they see opportunities to arbitrage, plain and simple. We should also therefore make use of this to earn for the protocol. The peg is important, and so is our bottom line. I am still not convinced that 0 fee PSM will lead us to mainstream adoption. ",

Again just really rough calculations here but the tldr is that rate cuts that are too deep effectively net lose revenue to the system and can\u2019t be recovered easily, so more gentle changes may be more appropriate. However, more research on other vaults and over other time-frames is necessary to extend this conclusion.  image1312\u00d7235 10.4 KB  The price elasticity of this vault for this rate shock is on the order of -2.5. This move effectively lost Maker ca. 200k in annualized revenues as the increase in borrowing demand did not compensate for the decrease in rates. Furthermore, now that we are at the \u2018bottom\u2019 on rates as it were, we are stuck. Raising rates back to 25bps would flatten demand to 0. If we were to increase even 1bp we would lose another 100k in annualized revenues. All else being equal a more suitable cut would have been from 25bps to 17.5bps, which would have actually increased annualized revenues by 100k. This model suggests actually cutting from 5bps by another 1.5bps to 3.5 to pump demand by more than the decline in rates. Again this is just a toy model, not worth its salt for proper rate recommendations. But gentle step-changes are an interesting hypothesis worth exploring further and a heuristic that could be worth bearing in mind when it comes to rate-setting, particularly in a \u2018panic\u2019 as we try and shore up demand as best we can.

I wouldn\u2019t mind trying this as an experiment.  Some thoughts\u2026   I imagine currently, as soon as you place a fee on the PSM, the price of DAI would immediately move up to match it.  How high of a fee would be required to make minting DAI with new collateral worth it?   Another issue is that it would only ever be worth it if DAI eventually went back to the 1.00 peg.  If you add this fee and DAI\u2019s value just stays at say 1.01.  Well, you can mint and sell DAI at 1.01 but just end up paying stability fees waiting for the price to drop back to 1.00.  If it doesn\u2019t, your collateral is stuck unless you buy back at the same heightened price.   This type of usage doesn\u2019t seem super sticky although it does encourage people to get to learn how to open vaults which is a good thing.   Would increased volatility reduce overall long term demand for DAI?  You\u2019re basically allowing for a less stable DAI here.  Will that affect how people view it as a stablecoin?  People are sensitive to this.  Arbitragers make money at the expense of people who have to buy or sell.  The more unstable a coin is, the more those who transact in it get nickel and dimed with each transaction.  But maybe this is acceptable to some extent.   ",

On the other side, playing with the idea of DAI \u2248 $1 to incentivize vault owners will have consequences on adoption:  it would be hard to position DAI for large transactions, as a change on its peg could mean losses for one of the transaction parties. Think about the consequences this could have on the RWA lenders it would be hard to position DAI to retail because stablecoins are supposed to be stable, and when talking about money, you have to trust it (trust that it will be at 1 all the time, and you will be able to get fiat whenever you want). Of course, Dai is supposed to be a soft-pegged coin\u2026 but retail will never understand it. Would you save your money on something that you don\u2019t know how much will cost tomorrow?

It\u2019s just not acceptable to see users be liquidated if DAI depegs 1% from USD, which was a not so uncommon event before the PSM. Note: I agree with @brianmcmichael that in the whitepaper, DAI is described as having a \u201csoft peg\u201d with USD, and that its design and game-theoretic dynamics are kind of altered by having a 1:1 PSM-enforced peg with USDC.  But really, do people mostly want a strongly pegged or sotfly pegged coin? I mean, RAI has 14m marketcap\u2026 ",

There are multiple views in here in this thread that just cannot be held by members of the same collateral-backed stable coin protocol. One example is the idea of pushing away the reliance on centralized collateral vs having an iron-strong dollar peg in a time where most stablecoins have died or deviated way off-peg. One can look at MAI, MIM, LUSD etc. for examples. We need to solve these existentially paradoxically positions first, and let there be a peaceful departion of those that do not agree with the winning beliefs. Otherwise we cannot move forward. Seems like the existance of RAI could act as a secondary boat if Maker\u2019s Majority chooses to favor strong peg over all.  ",

But I think there is a shared vision out there of a DAI safely backed by all kinds of collateral not under the control of any one party or jurisdiction.  If this were ever able to happen, the PSMs would naturally shrink in comparison to these other collateral types.  We are where we are simply because demand for crypto backed loans has disappeared. The PSMs as they are now provide the clearest and simplest visibility into demand for holding DAI and allows the protocol to respond quickly if we were to see this demand flag.  We should not take these large PSMs for granted and be grateful that demand to hold DAI has not disappeared in the same way lending demand has.  If the fed hikes a little bit more, do not be surprised if we start seeing outflows again\u2026  Centralization to stablecoin issuers is a risk and obviously against the ethos of MKR but this bear market is not done.  So until revenues are increasing and profitability is clear, we must be careful not to weaken the position of the protocol in the quest to address these existential risks. ",

Unfortunately I don\u2019t think the incentives really play out like this in practice. Without PSMs (or with wider spreads), vault users face a lot of uncertainty about their total cost of borrowing, particularly over shorter time periods. So while users may have some theoretical profit opportunities if DAI price is eg. $1.005, they must also consider the risk that premium blows out to $1.01 (or even higher) at the time they want to repay. And those specifically targeting these arb opportunities would likely want to use higher leverage (to make the trade capital efficient enough to generate meaningful profits), but this increases risk of forced closing during a price spike. I\u2019d expect greater DAI price volatility to discourage ETH vault usage on net as most just want a safe, predictable, low cost way to leverage their holdings and are not interested in seeking profit by arbing the peg.

Leverage is already a risk that you\u2019re taking on, and the potential of a price spread in Dai is one of the risks you add to the calculus. If ETH moons and I want to get out with a gain the penny isn\u2019t going to make a difference. If ETH crashes and I need to repay the premium it\u2019s still cheaper than the liquidation penalty. If I want to repay Dai somewhere in between those extremes I can set limit orders and wait for the price to come to me. I don\u2019t think vaultholders are as sensitive to Dai price fluctuations as Dai holders. But Dai holders don\u2019t generate any sustainable revenue for the protocol and we can not prioritize them over our vaultholders. It also doesn\u2019t matter if most users aren\u2019t interested in arbing the peg. If there\u2019s a profit to be had there it doesn\u2019t take a majority of actors to play that market.

Because of it is so conservatively overcollateralized and relatively proven liquidation system, DAI is seen as safe. Owners continue to hold in DAI because these owners still want to keep assets on-chain   Yes it will be interesting to see what happens to DAI demand from PSM when the bull run returns and those funds return to risky assets. Will it be stable enough to maintain off-chain investments? We shall find out     Traster_Tray:  Open question - what other use cases are there for DAI holders?   I would think other DAI use cases include:  New crypto users first product Store of value in unstable economies Store of value for crypto traders Participating in DeFi Global remittances Transfers between crypto users On-chain Payroll for other crypto projects  I do think that for DAI demand to remain stable or increase in bear/bull markets use cases need to expand, I have seen ideas to expand DAI to other L1s, L2, finance RWA, expand PSM collateral, etc but would love to see use cases for the everyday person. Thinking something like partnering with Venmo/Cash App would be interesting. ",

Signalling then adding a fee change might not be the best next step, but it will likely be one of the outcomes. More importantly, the question we\u2019re really asking is: do we want to encourage vault opening (revenues) or market parity through liquidity? (which we also don\u2019t get paid for) They are intrinsically linked, but my hunch is that @brianmcmichael  is more correct, other platforms exist that are far more efficient for arbing peg discrepancies.  I took this note yesterday (forgive me @rema)  \u201cWhat we could do, is set hard peg limits higher than 1:1, at like 1-3% tin and have some of both worlds; assurance that peg wont spike and this arbing game of soft peg mechanisms\u201d  Understanding these questions via polls would be helpful:  What level of backing is the community comfortable backing DAI ? 30, 40, 50, 60 % ? 0 ? Should we turn on tin fees above that level? What amount of USDC on the books is needed for predictable RWA generation and management? What are the hard peg limits?  I think these parameters should be on the table at the MOMC tbh. In conjunction with understanding community sentiment we can slowly unwind what isn\u2019t necessary, send a signal that we don\u2019t want to make a market above a certain level, and put the assets to work when we have them above an acceptable amount. Ancillary questions:  How do we not rug GUNI vaults? Is there something creative we can do working with Curve etc.?  ",
