I\u2019ve also included some previous suggestions from myself and others. I\u2019m going to include numbered polls in an attempt to try to get a rough priority list for these improvements. Vote highly for those improvements that you would like to see sooner and less highly for those you think are less important. Pinging those who were part of the discussion in case they want to comment. @Vishesh @hexonaut @cyrus If anyone has any additional suggestions related to the State of the Peg presentation feel free to share in the comments and I\u2019ll add them to the initial post.   Add the seven day timescale VWAP Dai graph to dai.deschiper.io We only vote on the SF once a week, and by the time the 7-day VWAP is displayed in the Governance and Risk meeting the polls for the week have concluded. This means that voters may not be considering the full picture of the weekly Dai VWAP when voting.    1 2 3 4 5    0 voters      Add Moving Averages for different time periods This would give voters a better understanding of the peg deviation, it would help us separate long term from short term trends. (The the type of average, whether MA, EMA, volume or time weighted averages or some combination is up to the implementer.)    1 2 3 4 5    0 voters      Incorporate Dai/USDC markets in the VWAP graphs At the time of looking, the volume for USDC/DAI on coinbase is just under 2 million. On-chain DEX\u2019s tend to have lower volume, but in aggregate could be higher than expected. We should consider these when looking at peg deviation.    1 2 3 4 5    0 voters      Add more vertical lines to the VWAP graphs to denote significant fractions off-peg Perhaps every 0.005 cents? This would give voters a better idea of how far from the peg the average is at a glance. Because the graph\u2019s horizontal scale changes day by day, having only a single vertical line at $1 shows that we are off-peg, but not by how much in a visually obvious way.    1 2 3 4 5    0 voters      Find some way to measure orderbook depth and use this as an additional data point to determine peg deviation This has been suggested several times as an alternative to determine peg deviation. While I\u2019m not yet convinced it\u2019s better than looking directly at trades, it should be explored and possibly used as a supplemental metric.    1 2 3 4 5    0 voters     ",

What i mean is, instead of voting or updating them everyday, they could be updated every day and we would use less time on these ( less time on these = more time on something else = $$$ = win ) but they would still be part of the dataset that you are presenting. Almost like a bot. I am doing 2 right now if you want i can show you.  ",

On a point of courtesy, I would recommend against speaking on behalf of others, especially when there have been relatively few others taking part in the conversation thus far. There is good evidence that the Dai price oscillates around the peg, the average of this oscillation can deviate though. The point is that it\u2019s probably not enough to look at the price at this exact moment, you need to consider how the price has changed over the past period, how often was it above, how often was it below, by how much etc. On the subject of outliers though, it might be good to try to use the median price or the standard deviation somewhere in these calculated metrics?

OK, sorry. It seemed obvious to me that it was rather hard to buy DAI below $1 for the last 2-3 days unless you have a bot. I check bids several times a day and the bid price is always above $1. I mentioned my sources but I can be more specific if needed. Right now https://defi.ai/dai says that about $20k is available above $1 and that volume is not falling much over last 48 hours. The last ETH price now as an average of (Kraken, Bitstamp, CB Pro) is $221.47. The Uniswap price of 1 ETH -> DAI now is $219.69 which gives DAI=$1.008. If you substract the max. fee that centralized exchanges take (0.6% trade+withdrawal) you get DAI price of about $1.002. ",

Everyone wants their personal projects to be as useful as possible, but this is next to impossible without feedback, so I\u2019m going to bump this again here and in the chat. State of the Peg has existed for some time, and is an invaluable part of the weekly governance and risk call. That  said, the core price graphs have remained largely unchanged since their inception (barring updates to add more exchanges.) Please take a moment to read and rate the importance of these suggestions. ",
