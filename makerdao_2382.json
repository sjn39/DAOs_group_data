                    "content": "Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators Introduction The Maker Foundation is proposing a new role, the Interim Governance Facilitator, which is responsible for maintaining the ecosystem supporting the governance process. This role will follow the same \u2018interim\u2019 model shared by other foundation teams and is designed to, eventually, be entirely community-driven. \u201cInterim Governance Facilitators (IGFs) are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling.\u201d Their key function, though, is encapsulated in the name of the role, facilitation. The primary duty of the Facilitators is to ensure the smooth and efficient running of the distributed and open source governance process at Maker. As this document represents a formalization of the role he already occupies on behalf of the community, the Foundation is proposing that Richard Brown, Head of Community Development, be the first Interim Governance Facilitator. After a period of two weeks (set aside for debate and iteration on this framework), the community will have the opportunity to formally choose to accept or reject the proposal in a governance poll. Acceptance of the proposal will signal the ratification of the new role, the person chosen to exercise its mandate, the associated processes and procedures, and calendar outlined in this document. Why Do We Need Facilitation? Because governance is built on ever-shifting sands, the community needs to maintain as much agility as it can without sacrificing velocity. As the decisions that happen in Maker governance can have wide-ranging effects on the entire DeFi ecosystem, we need to keep vigilant against attack (from within and without) and to ensure the process runs smoothly, with as much integrity as possible. Defining the Role Like the other major governance-related roles, such as the Interim Risk Team and the Oracle team, the Facilitators are empowered by the community to perform tasks on behalf of the community. The Foundation is proposing this first iteration of a role that we hope will evolve through guidance provided by the community. After sufficient baseline processes have been established for the Interim Governance Facilitator, and proven successful, additional Governance Facilitators should begin to be onboarded. Working in concert across all major time zones, they will coordinate to ensure global access to the inner workings of Maker governance. The Interim Facilitator is responsible for gradually bootstrapping the governance processes and procedures necessary to create a more robust governance framework. This will be achieved through a rigorous cycle of policy proposal, feedback gathering, and through regular coordination with other governance stakeholders. As the following roles, responsibilities, and mandates of the Interim Facilitator become more clearly defined, we look forward to tasks being taken on by additional, community-sourced, Facilitators. Primary Responsibilities Ownership and Management of the Official Communications Channels Governance Facilitators are responsible for ensuring the health and integrity of official communication channels like forums and chat rooms. These tasks include moderation duties, establishing processes and social norms, broadcasting relevant information to the wider world, as well as defending the channels from trolling and Sybil attack. Defining the Governance \u2018Problem Space\u2019 Because Facilitators are empowered by the community as a whole, they cannot be seen to be partisan. They are not empowered to make \u2018governance\u2019 decisions, cannot campaign for any specific governance issue, nor should they express opinions about the merits of one polling or voting option over another. They must remain neutral and objective and focus wholly on policy, procedure, and facilitation. For example: a Facilitator should not suggest to the community that the Stability Fee should be raised or lowered, put forward an alteration to monetary or risk policy, or express an opinion about the desirability of one asset type over another. The role is one of collating and framing meaningful discussions and soliciting the community for appropriate solutions to issues as they arise. Once those solutions have been debated, the Facilitator is responsible for enacting processes that allow for various levels of consensus to be established and actions to be taken by Maker Token Holders. For example: a Facilitator would work with the members of the forum to establish rules around the creation of forum polls, appropriate phrasing, poll duration, etc. Once a poll has successfully concluded, the Governance Facilitator would be responsible for communicating that consensus to the wider community and, if required, ensuring that the poll is added to the governance portal for official ratification. Advocacy Governance Facilitators are responsible for raising community governance issues back to the Foundation or the third-party ecosystem and ensuring appropriate follow up for the community. Bootstrapping Process A governance model that is capable of managing a rapidly developing ecosystem as ours needs to be capable of iterating just as quickly. Governance Facilitators are tasked with nurturing the processes and procedures that will allow the community to rapidly develop in concert with the requirements of governance. \u201cThe users of governance have to shape governance.\u201d Governance is a hard problem and will continue to be so as the needs of the community grow, and the requirements of the system become increasingly sophisticated. Governance Facilitators will be responsible for preparing the community to iterate rapidly and effectively as we move along the long path to eventual decentralization. Facilitators will work closely with community members to identify and refine emergent process and workflows that can allow such a large and distributed \u2018remote team\u2019 of stakeholders to work together. Some questions Facilitators will collaborate with the community to answer:   Frameworks  How do we create canonical reference materials? Where do they live?    General Communications  How do we effectively broadcast governance issues to the wider community? How do we increase engagement?    Polls, Votes, and Signals  What are the best practices we should adopt when collecting, filtering, and identifying useful signals?    Manage Debate  Where does it live? How do we set the tone? When does a debate end?    Workflows  Where does \u2018work\u2019 happen? What pipelines and workflows do we need to formalize?    Framing the Debate As Facilitators are charged with maintaining and encouraging debate, they need to be vigilant in ensuring that the community adheres to the guidelines outlined in the Scientific Governance and Risk Framework and the Core Foundation Principals. For example, as a community, we debate the merits of the data being input into the system and the models themselves; opinions or debates about outputs are to be avoided. Unsubstantiated opinions are to be avoided in general. Problems are more readily solved by reminding the community that they are ultimately in charge of the outputs of the governance process. Facilitators should:  De-emphasize \u201cWhy don\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d questions. Emphasize \u201cHow can we\u2026?\u201d questions.  Maintaining a healthy debate is critical to the success of any community. It will be one of the most important duties of the Facilitators to ensure that the caliber of discussion remain high, that new members of the community understand the general level of decorum and civility expected by the group, that they have the resources they need to get onboarded quickly, and that the community doesn\u2019t suffer attrition from toxicity, trolling, or apathy. Establishing Consensus Once debate has ended, it\u2019s time to identify and encourage consensus-seeking behaviours. This is a pivotal and complicated task. Some questions the Facilitators will help the community to align on:  What does consensus mean? Where do we find it? How much consensus is enough? How do we maximize alignment between the Foundation, the voters, and various unaligned stakeholders? How do we promote consensus-seeking behaviours? How do we deal with contrarians and those unwilling to compromise? What does the \u2018least bad option\u2019 look like? Do we seek assent or assume it by looking for dissent instead?  Once the community has established the answers to these questions, the Facilitators are responsible for ensuring they are codified and adhered to. Finally, the Facilitators ensure they are communicated effectively to the wider ecosystem. Communicating and Scheduling the Roadmap Among many other things, governance is also a scheduling problem. The actions that Maker Token Holders need to take are dependent on a host of factors. The activities of partners, regulators, market forces, emerging verticals, etc., combine to create a high number of dependencies. Ensuring that there is a reasonably accurate short-term roadmap is the responsibility of the facilitators. They will achieve this by maintaining public documentation and roadmaps that will provide engaged stakeholders with the information they need to participate with the system and anticipate next steps. Through this constant iteration with the Foundation and the governance ecosystem, they will help the community to shape the future of the DAO. Coordinating with other Ratified Teams Governance Facilitators are a \u2018meta team\u2019 tasked with facilitating and supporting the actions of the rest of the mandated actors in the governance ecosystem. It will be key that public and transparent communication channels are set up, which allow the Risk, Oracle, and Governance teams to coordinate. Handling Emergencies There will likely be situations where the governance community must respond quickly to new information. It will be the job of the Facilitators to work with the community to establish an emergency voting process to defend the system against unplanned events. Managing the Governance Facilitators Although the role has been architected in such a way as to minimise any potential decision-making power, there may come a time when a Facilitator needs to be removed from the role. Whether for reasons of overstepping of mandates, an inability or unwillingness to enact community-supported initiatives, or a general lack of competence, there must be a system for alerting facilitators to a need for improvement or for replacing them altogether. Some topics for the community to explore in the coming weeks and months:  How does the community formally disagree with a Facilitator? How do we attract and train new Facilitators? Should Governance Facilitators have a term limit? How are they compensated? How do they coordinate with each other? How do we measure Facilitator success? How do we get rid of a bad Facilitator?  A possible solution to consider in the future: Should we have an ongoing \u2018confidence\u2019 poll for each Governance Facilitator? What happens in the event of an attack? What if a whale seeks to replace a person with a more amenable version? If the \u2018abuse of power\u2019 poll ever disappears, then perhaps an \u2018Emergency Governance Cycle\u2019 could start. What that looks like is still to be determined. Collateral Onboarding Priority Poll Process Facilitators are responsible for ensuring that new collateral types are added to the system by providing a clear path to doing so and effectively communicating the requirements and resources provided by the Risk Teams. For example, a facilitator would be responsible for shepherding a process like the following, by working closely with the risk teams:   Submission: Partners submit their collateral onboarding proposals in the Governance category in the forums. Once the proper due diligence has been completed, and the forum polls have finished with a supportive vote, the collateral type will be added to the next asset priority list poll.   Presentation: Through a governance call, an asset will be presented for review before the portal poll. This is not a decision making step; this is part of the Communicating and Scheduling section outlined above.   Prioritization: Once an asset has been added to the long term wishlist, it will be sorted through a priority poll. As other top picks are onboarded and removed from the long term wishlist, it should eventually reach the top of the list for inclusion.   Pre-Evaluation: All of the mandated and ratified teams then perform their risk evaluation on the assets at the top of the list. After the evaluation processes are complete, the team in question will mark the collateral with a) passed, b) passed but will take longer to finish, or c) rejected.   Evaluation: After a collateral asset has been accepted as being viable from all the relevant teams, they can then begin to do the full review and development of the risk construct and onboarding. Once a team has finished doing what they need to do for a given collateral type, they will mark it as \u201cready to go.\u201d   Short Term Wishlist: Once a collateral asset has received the ready-to-go mark from all the relevant teams, it is removed from the long term wishlist and added to the short term wishlist.   Queued for Next Governance Cycle: Once a collateral asset is on the short term wishlist, it can be added to General Risk Teams\u2019 Risk constructs and get passed in the following governance cycle.   The Framework, the Calendar, and Next Steps The process of ratifying a Governance Facilitator, much like a Risk Team, is one of signaling support for a package of roles, responsibilities, principles, and processes. Polling in a new facilitator represents the community\u2019s acceptance of the whole package and includes an associated roadmap and calendar. It is that calendar that allows the community to move ahead with governance. This will involve a Bootstrapping phase where the community debates and ratifies the roles and processes required to begin the second Governance Cycle phase. Please note: This roadmap is dependent on a collaborative effort spread amongst the Foundation, our partners, and the governance community. We cannot predict when dependencies may mis-align. It may be periodically updated, items may be added or removed, and the dates may change at any time. Bootstrapping Week of August 12   Proposal: Interim Governance Facilitator Mandate  Poll: Collateral Asset Priority List  Week of August 19   Proposal: Interim Risk Team Mandate  Week of August 26   Proposal - DSR Initial Values  Poll - Ratify the Governance Facilitator and Interim Risk Team  Week of September 9   Proposals - Oracle Team Mandate  Proposals - New Oracle Providers  Proposals - Oracle Incentive Restructuring  Week of September 16   Proposal - MCD Whitepaper  Poll - Ratify Oracle Team  Week of September 23   Poll - Long-term Collateral Asset Priority List  Proposal - The General Risk Model  TBD   Documentation - MCD Executive Vote Changelog  Poll - Initial Oracle Values  Poll - Initial DSR Values  Executive - Initializing the MCD system prior to launch  Governance cycles, DAO team onboarding, and other proposals After the Bootstrapping phase of the governance schedule has ended, we will switch to a regular cadence of discussion, debate, signal gathering, review, before the onchain polling and executive process begins. That onchain process could take many forms, from a simple cycle of proposal, review, voting to a more sophisticated process such as the following: Week 1: Request for Proposals - The Risk Teams will present the assets they have analysed to the forums for review. In the Governance call, the community will debate the risk construct and surface any contention. The Risk Teams have this week to accept final feedback from the community and to iterate. This week may also include the introduction of general administrative proposals not related directly to collateral onboarding. This week could also include an executive vote ratifying the previous month\u2019s governance cycle. Week 2: Request for Comments - We continue to evaluate the Risk Constructs and General Proposals of the previous week and review updates and merge in changes. Week 3: Collateral Inclusion Polls - We start the week with an Inclusion Poll which allows for the individual approval of the prior two weeks\u2019 General Proposals and Risk Constructs. Week 4: Final Collateral Wrap-up Poll - We begin a governance poll which is a rollup of the previous weeks\u2019 Inclusion Polls. Conclusion If this mandate is accepted by the community, it will signal its support for the new Governance Facilitator Role, Richard Brown as the first Interim Governance Facilitator, and signals support for the general scope of the initiatives outlined in this mandate. This mandate should be considered a living document and will be updated based on community feedback. ",

                    "content": "Catching up on current stuff, thoughts and responses to current discourse. Roughly half on governance facilitators, and half my conceptions of what scientific governance encompasses (especially relating to voting in any ratified actor). First thoughts, more sporadic: I\u2019m not sure we can get enough demand without paying facilitators for the bulk of the work. It looks like a lot. Facilitation, coordination and refinement of complex information is a tough task. If a facilitator has minimal decision making power, then a formal mechanisms for disagreeing with decisions shouldn\u2019t be super necessary. A poll of confidence or satisfaction rating may be a useful tool for gauging sentiment, but I would be wary of letting decisions on teams/individuals be susceptible to a network wide vote at any moment. Then, a few whales could reorg at will. Restricting voting times and keeping facilitators for a set term reduces that specific risk. Interested facilitators might be better off applying for grants from the governance apparatus. For example, apply for year long grant with some sort of midterm report/check up 6 months in the contract (or quarter or monthly, whatever we think most effective). In their application they would lay out their goals/hopes and the midterm report would relate progress and roadblocks to those ideas from their application. MKR holders could release a general framework for the application. I\u2019m thinking basic info, disclosure of mkr holdings to the community (arguments both ways), time in the community, other work done for the DAO, other experience, and statements regarding thoughts on the DAO and ideals for the future as well as controversial issues. If we are willing it could be a dynamic process. We could allow for applicants to define the amount/type of work they have bandwidth for, as well as an hourly rate. This lets governance more fully manage resources as well as more data to review the efficiency of the capital spent.  My second group of thoughts relates to the lack of science in some of our governance processes. I think it\u2019s a good time for MKR holders to recognize that \u201cscientific\u201d governance includes much more than math and engineering. The core principles document outlining scientific governance focuses mainly on risk management, failing to realize that risk cannot be fully captured in mathematical reductionist frameworks. I perceive that governance decisions must take into an account methods for growing social capital as an essential aspect of managing systemic risk. My lazy google definition of science: \u201cThe intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.\u201d (google, et al) Science defines all Intellectual and actionable activity devoted to the systematic study of structured frameworks as well as the observations of stuff within those frameworks. As an analysis tool it must analyze itself in order to eventually react when paradigm shifts occur (new data/structures to consider). For MKR holders that means to engage with scientific governance we need to fully consider the structures we utilize in context our goal of being a decentralized organization maintaining a global, sovereign, stable and secure socio-economic structure. Even the decision on how to set a framework for evaluating governance facilitators calls in a ton of questions about incentives, social relations between Maker ecosystem components, cultural differences and conflict resolution. To make wise decisions around expectations for these actors, MKR holders need to be informed by the social sciences such as interpersonal biology/psychology and sociology. Economics is a social science as well, to ignore that aspect of our collective decision making in favor of more \u201crigorous\u201d scientific thought appears imprecise. Reducing the scope and nature of our scientific inquiry fundamentally increases the systematic isolation of possible participants along with the robustness that comes with diversity of thought. Let\u2019s face it masculine perspectives generally dominate the communities thinkspace. No single team can encompass the demands of that goal obviously. The governance facilitators is a good place to start, I think, but I\u2019d also like the community to consider incentivising sociological inquiry/research into our ecosystem. This will help inform the vortex of complexity MKR holders must juggle to achieve the goals. I hypothesize that fuller inclusion of scientific thought will help clarify, rather than obfuscate what this organization hope to achieve. ",

The hope is that we will eventually have Facilitators in all the major regions. What a \u2018region\u2019 is and what languages provide the most coverage is something the community will have to work out. Perhaps one each for NA, EU, LATAM, APAC, etc.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And if you do implement Facilitators based on languages, regions, will each Facilitator follow the same, or a different agenda?   The Facilitators would have to collaborate very closely with each other to ensure that that same information is being broadcast to every region and that the issues from those demographics are brought back to the global community. Otherwise the role would just end up fragmenting and confusing the community instead of \u2018facilitating governance\u2019. Regardless, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be in a position to onboard additional Facilitators until after MCD launch. We\u2019ll all need to understand how exactly the community can fund it\u2019s own roles out of the Stability Fees first.     flipflopflapdelegate:  What are the characteristics needed to become a Facilitator?   We\u2019ve provided some guidelines above. The person would have to have deep insight into the workings of the MakerDAO and the crypto ecosystem, complete familiarity with our governance, basic understanding of finance and risk, etc. The rest of it basically falls into a general operations/project management type role I think. Make sure everything happens when it\u2019s supposed to, make sure people know what is going on, be a good communicator, capable of writing docs, etc. Fix problems and organize people.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Does the Maker community understand the core values of Facilitation?   If they read the mandate posted above they should. I\u2019m hesitant to get too deep into the weeds about core values though. This gig is 99% maintenance, paperwork, calendaring, moderation, and administration.     flipflopflapdelegate:  If a vote is needed to choose the Facilitators, how will the values of each candidate be evaluated?   There isn\u2019t a lot of leeway for a persons values to impact the role I hope; a facilitator should probably be focused on what the community\u2019s values are and reflect those. GF\u2019s should mostly be measured by their level of competence and ability to execute on the responsibilities listed above. This role is almost completely devoted to organizing, collating and helping to ratify things the way community wants it to. ",

                    "content": "So as usual, I\u2019m going to focus on what I disagree with (just because it\u2019s more useful.) But I\u2019d like to preface my response by saying that in general I think that the proposal as outlined is detailed, effective and I agree with the need for a Governance Facilitator role. In general, my disagreements are around process.  1. We should not ratify multiple proposals in one vote. While I accept that there is a desire for speed and efficiency here, I think it\u2019s a terrible idea to vote for a package of proposals rather than a single one. In legacy democratic systems, voting and gathering signals takes a great deal of effort and expense. In the digital space and for MakerDAO, this is not the case. It would not be overly costly to setup separate forum+onchain polls for the following:  Ratification of the Governance Facilitator Role as described. Ratification of Rich Brown as the Interim Governance Facilitator. Ratification of the Proposed Collateral Onboarding Process. Ratification of the Proposed Governance Cycle.  I recognise that these are not the focus of this document, but with the phrase:     rich.brown:  and signals support for the general scope of the initiatives outlined in this mandate.   I think it\u2019s important to highlight that we are voting on all of these and that we shouldn\u2019t be. Some may ask why this is necessary: these are mostly non-controversial. The problem is the precedent we set. We need to set the right precedents early on non-controversial issues such as these rather than argue about it later. This is also consistent with signalling guideline 3: The topic should seek to gather signals for only a single issue. If you want multiple signals, make multiple topics. (Not saying we need multiple topics here, but multiple polls would be nice.)     Point 1: Agree Point 1: Disagree     0 voters      2. We should poll as early as possible.     rich.brown:  I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s weird to poll on a doc that could materially change after a person votes on it.   I think the above is unavoidable under a consensus decision making system (which I\u2019ve argued elsewhere that we should use). While it is unintuitive, it is the most efficient way of gathering support and signals. The breakdown of responsibilities is:  The proposer keeps the proposal up-to-date with feedback based on comments and signals. The signalling party keeps their signal up-to-date.  This requires signallers to check-in or respond to notifications on a specific post, but I\u2019d argue that this is a relatively small cost that signallers are able to pay. If we are worried about signals not being updated (and generating in inaccurate picture of consensus), we can close (replace?) the poll each time the proposal changes and require all participants to vote again. If people prefer this, please advocate for it in the signal guidelines thread. In general there is virtually no cost to polling and it provides valuable information about the consensus around a proposal, I believe we should use it as often and as early as possible. (While writing I also realised it might be valuable to have polls within this post. So polls.)     Point 2: Agree Point 2: Disagree     0 voters      3. The Roadmap is very compact, there is little time for discussion on this proposal or other ratification proposals. For some of these proposals we have a single week for discussion before we move to an on-chain poll. This is perhaps less of an issue because we don\u2019t have a large number of active and contributing members of the governance community. Even still, this could be interpreted as the Foundation wanting the Maker community to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 these proposals by pushing through so much information and votes that no one has time to adequately judge or discuss them. Everyone is excited for MCD and no one wants governance to hold up the process, I can see that. But I don\u2019t want us to set bad precedents or for this to become our normal operating procedure. There was quiet for a long period (so much so that people were complaining about it.) Could we not have started this process earlier if we were worried about governance\u2019s readiness for MCD launch?     Point 3: Agree Point 3: Disagree     0 voters      4. There are many questions that will remain unanswered unless we pursue them in the future. There are multiple questions here to answer about the role and about consensus and how we do things. I recognise that these are descriptions of what the Governance Facilitator will be facilitating, but in order for them to facilitate, there needs to be impetus from the community to find the answers. It\u2019s important to find these answers at a stage when there isn\u2019t an alternative source of pressure comes into play. For example, we should decide on a process to remove a Governance Facilitator before we end up in a situation where we need to remove one. At that point, the priority shifts to fixing the problem (removing the bad actor) rather than creating a robust and future-proof process.     Point 4: Agree Point 4: Disagree     0 voters      5. Support for Mitote\u2019s points on the importance of the social aspects of scientific governance.     Mitote:  For MKR holders that means to engage with scientific governance we need to fully consider the structures we utilize in context our goal of being a decentralized organization maintaining a global, sovereign, stable and secure socio-economic structure.   Specifically the above. We need to build a stable community around governance, and frankly it needs to be larger in terms of both participants and differing perspectives. It\u2019s incredibly important to recognise that by default, humans are not rational creatures. We need to work to mitigate this and promote the use of the scientific method not only around controlling risk, but around how we operate as a decision-making group.     Point 5: Agree Point 5: Disagree     0 voters     ",

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  While I accept that there is a desire for speed and efficiency here, I think it\u2019s a terrible idea to vote for a package of proposals rather than a single one.   I think terrible might be a strong word here. Splitting it up into numerous sections has pros and cons, but more cons in my opinion. I\u2019d much rather put a cohesive package in front of the community and, if there is contention, figure out why, find a middle ground, and, if none is forthcoming, then start breaking pieces out into individual polls. Every step of complexity we add to this system will inevitably lead to additional steps. This represents a very real risk to governance. If we break these mandate packages out, what is the granularity? The major headings? Each one of the responsibilities? All the responsibilities but not the moderation duties? The whole calendar, parts of it, the calendar as a concept? We have a great deal of work to do, I think we should be focusing not on whether we can do something, (or whether we lack the insight to see beyond precedent) and focus more on whether there is a need to add complexity to an already full workload. It is critical that the community understands that these mandates aren\u2019t commandments. They are living documents that describe the \u201cgeneral scope of the initiatives\u201d as stated in the conclusion. It\u2019s my expectation that they will be refreshed, updated, refined, regularly.     LongForWisdom:   We should poll as early as possible. \u2026  I think the above is unavoidable under a consensus decision making system\u2026 While it is unintuitive, it is the most efficient way of gathering support and signals.   I\u2019m not seeing why this is unavoidable or efficient. It\u2019s seems far more intuitive to post a proposal or a mandate, discuss for a set time period, integrate changes, respond to debates, then poll for a set time period. This thread is a perfect example. You have added a series of sub-polls that solicit community feedback on 5 issues that have gone un-answered by me up until now. Is it realistic to expect that the people that already voted had heard from all sides of the debate? That they will now return to the thread, re-read everything and update their votes? What additional confusion would be added if there was already a poll running on the GF mandate and I came in today (almost a week later) to materially change it based on community feedback?     LongForWisdom:   The Roadmap is very compact, there is little time for discussion on this proposal or other ratification proposals.        LongForWisdom:  For some of these proposals we have a single week for discussion before we move to an on-chain poll.   Until we understand the community\u2019s appetite for debate we need to make up numbers and then tweak as needed and then measure that level of debate against internal and external timelines. The calendar in the mandate is designed to align governance with the ecosystem actors and the foundations efforts to launch MCD.     LongForWisdom:  Even still, this could be interpreted as the Foundation wanting the Maker community to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 these proposals by pushing through so much information and votes that no one has time to adequately judge or discuss them.   It could be interpreted as that but I\u2019d rather wait until someone makes that case before we alter our behavior based on it.     LongForWisdom:  Could we not have started this process earlier if we were worried about governance\u2019s readiness for MCD launch?   That\u2019s kind of a metaphysical question. Yes, in theory. No, in practice  Maker is a large scale software development project (arguably the base DeFi protocol) that is heavily dependent on a rapidly evolving  space and has dependencies on a fantastic amount of external stakeholders. The sheer number of external partners, market pressures, projects, internal legal, development, security, auditing, verification, integrations, business development, marketing, PR, risk, community, departments and initiatives, etc, etc, etc that all need to align is mind-numbing. All those elements needed to sync and publish their own mini-roadmaps to create the items that need to be on the main roadmap which informed the governance roadmap that required a Facilitator which in turn needed to publish a mandate. The mandate needs to get ratified in a timely manner so the GF can ensure the milestones occur in way that ensures that governance isn\u2019t the blocker for all the previously mentioned stakeholders.

                    "content": " Disclaimer: Rich is doing a good job. I am happy, as everybody else, to see it formalised in some way in the DAO. This is post about the methodology, not about specific people. Hello, inspired by the excellent post of LongForWisdom I also decided to express my concerns about the recent governance topic: about the Facilitator role and the first interim facilitator, Rich Brown. First of all, as already pointed out by LongForWisdom, there are multiple questions in this governance topic. I guess more or less everybody would agree that a facilitator role is necessary, or at least useful, or at least not negative. So (I expect) most people would not oppose the activation of such role. So one of the questions is probably universally accepted, but the others need more discussion. This said: 1) I find it weird that the first role that is voted on in the MakerDAO is that of the facilitator. While important this does not seem the MOST important and the first that should be voted on. I mean, the MakerDAO will require a lot of roles (aka \u201cjobs\u201d) when it\u2019s up and running and independent of the Foundation. Examples:  Head of Oracles? Head of Communications? Head of Development? Head of Risk Analysis? Head of Web Services Head of Client Support (?)  Not to mention that, when the DAO becomes very big, we will likely have:  Head of Communications > International Head of Communications > USA Head of Communications > Europe and so on.  and then  Head of Communications > USA > California Head of Communications > Europe > Germany  and so on\u2026 2) So why start with a job such as the \u201ccommunity facilitator\u201d? Why not try to organise the big picture first, and agree on its structure? Natural questions to be discussed:  How many jobs do we want to vote on at the level of the governance (I.e., on-chain)?  I mean, probably we don\u2019t want to vote for each sigle little job (e.g., translator of a couple of documents). We just want to vote on big roles (e.g., Head of translations) which will then deal with a lot of other people \u201cunder them\u201d off-chain.  How do we plant to recruit people? This time Rich Brown was the only proposed name. I think this is a very bad practice, even if we are still at the very beginning, We should definitely try to have a \u201ctransparent application process\u201d with people sending their CV, and other data, e.g., specifying a minimal salary they want.  What if in the MakerDAO chat we currently have, using an anonymous nickname, the head of communication of Harvard University? And what if (S)He was willing to do the \u201cFacilitator Job\u201d for 24 months for free? (very hypothetical, but still\u2026) Would we still vote for Rich Browns? Maybe yes, maybe not.   In this light, who is going inside the MakerDAO to evaluate the CVs? Who is going to shortlist the applicants?   similarly, what is going to be the procedure to determine the salaries? Are we expected to vote for each salary, of each job? This obviously does not scale. So we need to discuss a hierarchical structure and delegate decisions. This will work only high levels of transparency which, fortunately, should be possible with blockchain.   It seems to me that this structure is what should be designed/discussed/voted-on at the beginning. Not the \u201cfacilitator\u201d job + Rich Brown as interim. 3) One could say \u201cOK, but we need to start with somewhere with something\u2026\u201d. I totally agree. But if we have to do this, let\u2019s do this well, with some conceptual organisation. Let\u2019s do this in an organised manner! Not just by voting on a random role, that is anyway already being well done (and paid for by the Foundation) by Rich Brown. The facilitator Job, as described by Rich himself during the last call, is supposed to create a discussion link between the community (Reddit, Chat, Forum, other) and the Foundation. Good. This is useful (especially since Rune, Steve etc have not participated to the calls for a long while). But this link can potentially be informal. Before formalising this job, I\u2019d very much rather discuss and vote on the general \u201cjob hierarchy and structure\u201d of the MakerDAO (independent from the Foundation!). TLDR: in line with my previous post () I feel this vote is again one instance of \u201clet\u2019s play the DAO for a while with some pseudo-random stuff, and buy time\u201d. OK, I want to play. But I\u2019s like to play it properly! ",

Apologies.     rich.brown:  what is the granularity? (Ed: re splitting the proposal)   Feels like common sense is the answer here. It doesn\u2019t need to be subdivided into oblivion, but the four divisions I suggested are logically distinct.     rich.brown:  \u2026 and focus more on whether there is a need to add complexity to an already full workload.   I am 100% against adding complexity without need. I do think there is need to split proposals into logically distinct units, and I\u2019m not even convinced this adds complexity. The Foundation feels similarly, or we would be ratifying all the proposals (Risk, Oracle, Facilitator) in a single giant info-dump. The disagreement is about where the logical split is and I\u2019m arguing that the logical split is incorrect here. A proposal should include everything required for that logical unit and no more, the role, the person filling the role, the governance cycles and the timeline are logically distinct: they could exist in isolation and still make sense. A more granular split at the level of (as an example) the responsibilities of the facilitator makes less sense: they would lack context in isolation. I\u2019m not convinced a lot of people feel strongly about this though. So yeah, feel free to ignore me. On Polling     rich.brown:  I\u2019m not seeing why this is unavoidable or efficient.   It\u2019s only unavoidable if you want to run under a consensus decision making system, currently we aren\u2019t. (But I think we should)     rich.brown:  It\u2019s seems far more intuitive to post a proposal or a mandate, discuss for a set time period, integrate changes, respond to debates, then poll for a set time period.   I agree, that\u2019s more intuitive, I specifically admitted my alternative was less intuitive (but that I felt it was more efficient)     rich.brown:  I\u2019m not seeing why this is unavoidable or efficient.   Polls make discussion and debate more efficient because they allow members of the community to easily see and understand roughly how much support or contention there is around a specific idea. They are not perfect, but they cost nothing and they allow everyone to better understand the state of consensus. A couple of examples on how polls could have improved efficiency  You asked many questions around updating signals, which boil down to whether it is realistic to expect people to keep track and update signals in response to changing proposals. If we\u2019d included a poll here we would have some vague idea of the answer. Instead we have an open question and the hope that someone will comment on it (even though comments are more costly and time-consuming than signalling in a poll.) We don\u2019t know if it is contentious, we don\u2019t know if it is clearly one way or another. We don\u2019t know nothing. It seems fairly obvious to me that this proposal is going to be approved with close to unanimity. This is fantastic, but we could have had \u2018evidence\u2019 (as rough as it is) of this information a week ago. If we have the information that everyone is on board with a proposal, then we can skip or cut short the debate and go to an on-chain poll. If this poll had shown that the proposal was contentious, or widely disliked, you could have immediately reacted to this information. Without this, we are left guessing at how much consensus is implied by a certain number or intensity of comments.  On Calendar     rich.brown:  The calendar in the mandate is designed to align governance with the ecosystem actors and the foundations efforts to launch MCD.   I think everyone understands why the timeline is compact. But the goal of launching MCD on time doesn\u2019t feel compatible with giving the community the time to contribute meaningfully to these proposals. There is nothing wrong with this (it\u2019s a trade-off I don\u2019t ultimately disagree with), but I feel like it should be recognised.     rich.brown:  It could be interpreted as that but I\u2019d rather wait until someone makes that case before we alter our behavior based on it.   My feelings on this (and the reason I brought it up) is that to me, it appears as if this is what is happening, but because I trust that the Foundation is doing what they think is best for the development of MakerDAO, I accept that it is the \u2018price of progress\u2019 even if I disagree with it. The problem is that trust in the Foundation in general was shaken after the purple pill thing, and that some no longer trust the Foundation after that episode. Maintaining trust is always easier than winning it back. If the Foundation wants to win it back (this may not be a goal, in which case fair enough), they need to be above reproach.     rich.brown:  That\u2019s kind of a metaphysical question.   This was kind of a metaphysical question, and, on reflection, not a particularly fair one to ask. So apologies for that too. ",

Natural questions to be discussed:   Facilitation of governance is probably the biggest stumbling block for the community right now. We have alot of complexity to contemplate, debate and design. Organizing dynamic collections of ideas and information is a huge deal. Also the risk team mandate was posted only a day later.

The one thing we don\u2019t have is time. I probably failed to express that in the initial mandate / calendar. We\u2019ve mapped things out with as much detail as we possibly could to try to align the work governance needs to do to keep pace with the rest of the org, our partners, risk teams, etc. for MCD launch. We don\u2019t want governance to be the blocker if at all possible. I believe I go into it above, but in the interest of expediting the process as much as possible, everything we need to start bootstrapping this wave of governance is wrapped up in the mandate. The thinking on our end is that we would block out two weeks of debate and in the absence of clear dissent around any of the issues in the doc we will put it to a vote. Why two weeks? Because that is the most time we had in the calendar that would allow the community to ratify the role so we can kick off everything else in the calendar. I agree that having so much in one proposal is sub-optimal but, in the absence of clear contention about the contents of the mandate, rather than its form, it\u2019s the best way for us to keep velocity up for launch. In the future we can break things out into as many pieces as the community wants, as we presumably won\u2019t have something like an MCD launch looming in the distance. ",

While important this does not seem the MOST important and the first that should be voted on. I mean, the MakerDAO will require a lot of roles (aka \u201cjobs\u201d) when it\u2019s up and running and independent of the Foundation.   This first role is the one that paves the way for governance to have the policies and procedures in place to create those other roles.     iammeeoh:   Head of Oracles? Head of Communications? Head of Development? Head of Risk Analysis? Head of Web Services Head of Client Support (?)    Very few of those roles have any clear definition, nor does the community have a pressing need for them to get MCD out the door, which is the single goal of the org right now. Not to mention that there is no way for the community to pay for any of those roles yet. Decentralization is a long path, not a switch we turn on, it is going to take months, if not years, to fully flesh out all the roles required, their management, their mandates, arbitration, compensation, etc, etc. It would take a fully centralized, hierarchical org, 6 - 12 months of significant effort to hire and train that many people with a dedicated team of recruiters. If you add on the layers of complexity of a DAO, then you can start adding multipliers. The community hasn\u2019t even started the debates about what our DAO actually is yet.     iammeeoh:  So why start with a job such as the \u201ccommunity facilitator\u201d? Why not try to organise the big picture first, and agree on its structure?   The Governance Facilitator is tasked with helping the community to begin to answer those questions. I think you might be putting the cart before the horse here.     iammeeoh:  How do we plant to recruit people? This time Rich Brown was the only proposed name. I think this is a very bad practice, even if we are still at the very beginning, We should definitely try to have a \u201ctransparent application process\u201d with people sending their CV, and other data, e.g., specifying a minimal salary they want.   This is a model that we will be repeating for roles the Foundation is paying for during the bootstrapping phase. Risk, Governance, Oracle, etc teams and leads will be dedicated resources from the org until such time as the community has organized itself to a place where it can onboard and fund the roles itself.     iammeeoh:  What if in the MakerDAO chat we currently have, using an anonymous nickname, the head of communication of Harvard University? And what if (S)He was willing to do the \u201cFacilitator Job\u201d for 24 months for free?   If someone more qualified than me arrives in the next week or two, has a deeper insight into maker governance, and is willing to work two or three days a week for the next two years for free, you have my solemn promise I will vote for them.

A proposal should include everything required for that logical unit and no more , the role, the person filling the role, the governance cycles and the timeline are logically distinct: they could exist in isolation and still make sense. A more granular split at the level of (as an example) the responsibilities of the facilitator makes less sense: they would lack context in isolation. I\u2019m not convinced a lot of people feel strongly about this though. So yeah, feel free to ignore me.   I will never ignore you!  I mention above in another response: I agree, the bundling of everything is non-optimal. It could be interpreted as some sort of bamboozle maybe where we are trying to sneak something in a big wall of text. I don\u2019t think we did though, and it\u2019s all in the original post for people to look for if they don\u2019t believe me. The reason it\u2019s all in there is because we have a fantastically aggressive timeline to get MCD launched this year. To stay on track we have to ratify a role and a mandate and a proposed calendar of events. If there is contention about any part of the mandate we can re-evaluate and if there is significant contention, the community can choose to vote no to it and we can go back to the drawing board. The biggest issue I\u2019ve seen yet though is the format of the mandate as opposed to its content. The next time around (post mcd) we will definitely split things up.     LongForWisdom:  It seems fairly obvious to me that this proposal is going to be approved with close to unanimity. This is fantastic, but we could have had \u2018evidence\u2019 (as rough as it is) of this information a week ago. If we have the information that everyone is on board with a proposal, then we can skip or cut short the debate and go to an on-chain poll. If this poll had shown that the proposal was contentious, or widely disliked, you could have immediately reacted to this information. Without this, we are left guessing at how much consensus is implied by a certain number or intensity of comments.   Maybe we are talking about two different things? My belief is that having a poll before people have a chance to talk about the issues at hand potentially invalidates early votes. If people vote \u201cNo\u201d because of a typo or a miscommunication, I come back and fix it, how many people will go back and update their votes? That\u2019s why I wanted to have a forum poll 7 days after the initial posting. Which I am now 4 days behind on\u2026 ",

Someone needs to be the central point of communication with the community and I think it makes perfect sense to do it this way. So I completely support this role, the way it is laid out here and @rich.brown  for the function but we have to keep in mind it won\u2019t be Rich forever. I have a lot of trust in @rich.brown but I consider this role to be an attack vector because of the (insider) information it will has to deal with and the weight of the persons word in the entire system. Therefor I also think GF\u2019s will need to disclose certain information:  Any ties to other projects/investors/\u2026 Disclosure of token holdings/control, not only MKR and not an actual number but an indication which can still keep it anonymous \u2026  < 100 MKR, < 1000 MKR, < 10000 MKR, \u2026 \u2026?  Ratification of this package I entirely agree with @LongForWisdom that voting for entire packages is far from ideal. I actually don\u2019t have a problem with it in this particular case but I don\u2019t want this to be the default way of going about things. I understand each individual vote, off and on-chain, adds additional work but I don\u2019t feel like governance can be rushed because of it. It\u2019s been mentioned a few times in the calls that a lot of parties need to be aligned to get MCD out the door and governance is a big part of that but the problem is that we, as governance, have absolutely no idea who those parties are and why they are dependent/influential on the timeline. In regards to voting on packages, this might sound like an exaggerated comparison but I feel like this could quickly end up the way US politics handles bills. A bill gets proposed to handle a certain issue and by the time it gets voted on, 99 other issues, totally irrelevant tot the original issue got tacked on and ratified or denied along with the original issue in a single vote. I really want to avoid such a system. In short, I will vote for this \u201cpackage\u201d but I prefer to vote on individual issues whenever possible in the future. For example, I would hate to vote on a single package to add multiple collateral assets. Each asset needs its own vote in my opinion. Not just for clarity about what the vote is about but how else are we supposed to debug a problem with the stability of the system if you change a huge part of the entire system in one single vote? This discussion is for another thread but it\u2019s the best example I have on why I am against package voting. Compensation This is one of the main topics we need to clarify as soon as possible because this single issue will  determine if the DAO can sustain itself or not. I assume the Foundation must have some idea of where the money should come from and how much it could be when it started out this project? ",

The intention was to wait until we all had a chance to gauge the level of interest and/or contention around the subject, then, once the debate died down, kick off the forum poll to gather signal for the portal poll. I believe it could have been started at the end of last week, but as time is tight, I\u2019d like to begin the forum vote today and have it run until Monday.

In light of this I\u2019d like to kick off the forum poll today and have it run until Monday September 2nd at 3 PM UTC.
