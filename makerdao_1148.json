In the MakerDAO official discord (this is in my URL bar: Discord, I use the browser), the only channel I see under the General heading is \u201cMedia Inquiries\u201d, and there are a handful of Info channels. It looks like no substantive discussion happens there. Additionally, when I try to click the Discord link in the upper right of the forum, I get redirected to a link to download the desktop app, which I\u2019d like to avoid unless I need to use it. Is there some other Discord presence that I\u2019m missing? I also raise this because if I\u2019m having a hard time maybe someone else is too\u2026 ",

I was prompted to accept the rules  via a modal pop-up, and then when I skimmed the rules post, it seemed redundant so I didn\u2019t read that closely. I also didn\u2019t understand the rules \u201cCommunity\u201d role, especially because the following sentence encourages you to explore the server, but doesn\u2019t directly indicate you\u2019re basically unable to do anything until you accept the Community role. I thought that might be something more specific than just a general member, and then I promptly forgot to try following the instructions when I couldn\u2019t find another solution. If I can help at all drafting alternate language or directing this feedback to someone, let me know! ",
