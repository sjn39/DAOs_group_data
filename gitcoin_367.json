I believe that there are many more projects that are either pre-investor or pre-business-model-stage that can benefit much more from CLR matched funding. By limiting funding to pre-investor projects, I believe Gitcoin is able to:  Increase its impact with earlier stage public goods projects that in greater need of funding Achieve the same impact while becoming even more capital efficient (excess funding can be used to funneled towards other more productive uses)  I would not oppose Gitcoin efforts in helping/support investor-funded public goods / community-owned projects but do not believe CLR is the current appropriate avenue.  Discussion  Are investor funded projects no longer open source public goods?  Imo, you can take funding from investors and still be classified as a community owned public good to some degree. Community ownership exists on a spectrum here.   What classifies as \u2018VC funded\u2019?  A for profit entity with external funding from investors either public or privately.     Potential solutions:  Maybe require projects to opt-in in order to participate in CLR matched funding rounds - where the t&c would indicate that only non-investor funded projects can opt in. Manual moderation can be used to enforce this rule if broken.  ",

Gitcoin has a lot to offer (outreach, community etc.) apart from CLR matching funding. And all projects should be able to get that. But as you also mentioned, well funded projects, be it VC or a token/ICO are already well on their way to build their products. CLR matching would not have as significant an impact there as it would in a project that is being bootstrapped or is just even starting.  Are investor funded projects no longer open source public goods?  Well it depends. Is it opensource? Can people learn from it? Use it? I honestly never liked the public good definition. For me gitcoin was always about funding opensource and at least for me it helps have a clear definition between what I believe should be and should not be funded.  What classifies as \u2018VC funded\u2019?  Probably VC funded is not the right term. \u201cFunded\u201d or \u201cWell funded\u201d would be the right term. Either via a VC round, or a token/ICO.  Maybe require projects to opt-in in order to participate in CLR matched funding rounds -  I really like the idea of opt-in CLR with a T&C specifying they need to not have a sustainable source of funding.

Plenty of VC funded projects are non-profits so thats a separate topic (and visa-versa). I think everyone is going in the right direction. Though I think any arbitrary cut-off quickly becomes irrelevant. 250-500k to a project with a team in India might be \u201cwell funded\u201d, but the same amount to an American or European team is an existential crisis. I\u2019d elect to codify a rule against \u201cfunded\u201d projects, and let the projects decide what that means. If a project that the community feels is \u201cfunded\u201d elects to receive CLR matching, they could then be required to make a verifiable statement regarding where the funds specifically will be allocated and exactly the value they provide (value that otherwise might not be possible). This would avoid the issues of actually defining what \u201cfunded\u201d means, while still adhering to the distribution and ethos we\u2019re trying to establish. ",

Grants are excluded from this calculation (not investment) as well as revenues (not investment). Projects can ask for an exception by exposing their case in this governance forum. Projects who received funding during or after receiving CLR matched funding don\u2019t have to return funds but they are kindly invited to to pay-it-forward  and contribute to the next round(s) of gitcoin grants.

Maybe a VC-funded project can give back to gitcoin community if they are in a good shape and win some kudos and loves. On the other hand, I wonder if a VC-funded project are experiencing some hardship maybe Gitcoin and give grants/matching grants in exchange for some equity/token - like of like a bridge round with some external valuations, and if the company turn out to survive the hard time and the equity/token turned out to be valuable, it might be able to diversify the source of income for Gitcoin. Maybe hard to execute legally, but just to throw the idea out there. ",

But I believe Gitcoin could add a new option for the grant like: already funded: yes  or no the default could be no, but for the projects which got VC fund, they also would like to get the exposure, and get the community support, so they could create grants without CLR match.

In general, I think it\u2019s fair to say that VC funded projects don\u2019t necessarily need funding from Gitcoin to survive, and shouldn\u2019t be a priority over things that are more clearly public goods. That said, I think the biggest question to me is, how we determine whether or not something was actually funded by VCs in the first place. It seems like projects that are less up front about their fundraising could easily end up getting an advantage over those that are transparent. Would it be worth thinking about slashing penalties of some kind here? ",

I totally agree with the fact that VC funded projects shouldn\u2019t benefit from CLR matching. It is used to financially propel high user/fan base projects that don\u2019t want or can\u2019t benefit from external financing. This should always be the case. The questions is more about how do you police bad actors ? The idea of slashing is pretty cool, maybe with an external court ? ",
