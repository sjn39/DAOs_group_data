The HackMD doc can continue to be used for notes / questions. Next Steps as listed in that doc:  New York Security Token Exchange is willing to host the discussion http://www.securitytoken.foundation  Use a different platform for holding the next call. Google meet limited us to only 25 participants. Zoom? Schedule regular calls, what should be the cadence? Meeting in Prague before Devcon. Added the topic to the call for rings on ETHMagicians: Council of Paris - HackMD  Setup Telegram / webpage for \u201calliance\u201d  Anyone looking to join at Council of Prague will need to register here: https://www.picatic.com/ethmagicians-prague-2018 (currently waitlisted, but we\u2019ll be making more tickets available later this week).
