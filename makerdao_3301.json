                    "content": "Simple Summary of the EIP \u201cA transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion\u201d (Source) The concept was initially proposed in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin (Source), and first formalized as an EIP by Eric Conner. Since then, it has been implemented in 4 clients, subjected to expert academic review, and is currently in the testnet proving phase. See here for an up-to-date list of resources maintained by Tim Beiko. Why is signaling needed for something external to MakerDAO? It is useful to measure community sentiment, especially when it will have varying impacts on Ethereum stakeholder groups; this includes the application layer. We are also reaching out to many other leading applications and tools, and will present our findings at the upcoming 1559 community panel on Feb 26th. Our results would be incomplete without the MakerDAO community\u2019s position represented. Client teams are far enough along in implementation and testing that a network upgrade potentially including 1559 has been tentatively scheduled for July 2021. In the unlikely event of a contentious chainsplit, MakerDAO would have to choose which chains to maintain the DAI system on. Clear, early signals from leading applications regarding their preferred featureset (eg. the chain that implements 1559 or not) will help to decrease uncertainty for the entire ecosystem leading to the upgrade. While there is no exact precedent for this type of direct survey, given the scope of the change, we thought it important that application communities become familiar with the mechanisms that make 1559 work. It is not expected that explicit polling for EIPs will become common in the future. Expected Benefits  More predictable gas fees, reducing user overpayment  \u201cShopping on Amazon is a lot easier than buying a house in a competitive real estate market. On Amazon, there\u2019s no need to be strategic or second-guess yourself; you\u2019re either willing to pay the listed price for the listed product, or you\u2019re not\u201d (Section 4.2) This will lead to better UX for users and applications   Preventative maintenance to avoid possible future chain reorgs  In conditions where fees significantly outweigh block rewards, there is an ever present incentive for block producers to carry out short term reorgs to capture as much value as possible. Burning the BASE_FEE removes this latent incentive. Read more here: On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward    Cements the role of ETH within the Ethereum crypto-economic system  Burning the BASE_FEE adds a real and consistent cost to economic abstraction (paying for transactions out-of-band, or \u201coff-chain\u201d, in non-ETH assets)   Will allow in-protocol congestion oracle  Once EIP-1559 is live, it will enable a native congestion oracle via EIP 3198 - A useful tool for applications    Possible Downsides  Technical complexity  Reforming the fee market for a live, value bearing chain like Ethereum is no small task. All client level issues aimed to de-risk it are tracked here.   Miners are largely opposed to it, and are threatening to make the upgrade contentious  The BASE_FEE burn, an integral part of the system, has led to miner opposition because it will reduce their income.    Misconceptions  Lowering individual transaction fees  Transaction fees are a function of supply and demand, and this EIP does not attempt to increase average available blockspace or alternatively, reduce demand.   BASE_FEE burning is meant to punish miners  Burning the BASE_FEE is the simplest mechanism to ensure the elastic blocksize is not gamed by miners. If not burnt, then miners could costlessly increase the blocksize while extracting maximum BASE_FEEs from users, and recoup their sent losses.   Increasing ETH price  While sometimes mentioned by proponents of this EIP, this is not a stated goal for any of the constituent mechanisms.    Thanks to the MakerDAO community for their consideration, we are looking forward to questions and discussion!    MakerDAO supports EIP-1559  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     LFW: This poll will continue until Thursday 25th February and move on-chain on the following Monday, regardless of the off-chain signal outcome. This is so we can see MKR Holder response in addition to the community response. ",

I don\u2019t personally support this EIP and I think the community is downplaying the importance of miners and the security/decentralization they provide for the network.

My understanding is limited but the fees from minting are fixed in ETH while those from fees are more volatile. But you can expect a baseline of fees over a long period. Today or soon, you can probably hedge the ETH price just like the McChicken & Ray Dalio. Whatever the fees are (minting + average gas costs), the mining process is a commodity. It means the largest miners (buying power) with the lowest energy costs increase capacity until it\u2019s no longer profitable for them. Which is already unprofitable for 98% of the small competitors. You can double the average gas costs or burn all of it, the equation works exactly the same. EIP-1559 will remove some hash power but the increase of ETH price will add some as well. PoW is by design leading to mining concentration. This seems to be a serious problem that is not addressed (not sure I never thought about that before). Not sure PoS will change much. EIP-1559 is important to surf on the deflation narrative that will help to put ETH as a store of value in the eyes of the public until we solve scalability issues. And with PoS it would be good to kill BTC that is an environmental nightmare. PS: I have a feeling that TIP will be used almost all the time. ",

                    "content": "Regarding the effects of mining concentration from PoW - it\u2019s not entirely clear what is optimal. Having too much centralization is definitely very bad, but there are also diminishing returns on decentralization. Ideally, we\u2019d also like participants that have a lot invested in the system, such as their career and multi-million dollar facilities. These two properties exist virtually, by design, in most DPoS systems, as well. An acceptably decentralized number of validators is targeted, and validators wishing to compete (along with their delegators) must put money on the line to prove their commitment. I\u2019m still not entirely convinced PoS will be able to compete with PoW from strictly a security perspective. There are many edge cases to consider, and compromise is usually permanent, barring a coordinated manual intervention fork. That said, security should only exist to serve a goal. And what is the goal of Ethereum? I do not see it as the ultimate store of value, nor do I think it can compete for such a goal. Such a goal implies being conservative, simple, and highly secure. Ethereum is adaptive, fast moving, even experimental at times. It strives to unlock functionality, and ether is the use-token that is meant to be used for interaction. Because of this nature, I think it\u2019s best left slightly inflationary, despite that I\u2019d personally profit otherwise. Inflationary money is typically spent more easily, and that environment attracts more applications. I do think the adaptive block sizes in EIP-1559, and PoS/sharding from Eth2, are all great fits for the protocol, though. And @brianmcmichael makes an excellent point that MakerDAO would probably prefer deflationary collateral. So perhaps it\u2019s worth accepting regardless. Does anyone understand why the controversial burning clause was included in EIP-1559, rather than as a separate proposal? Functionally it seems a fixed fee with dynamic blocks should be entirely possible without the burning. ",

                    "content": "    psychonaut:  This is weird logic. If the cost of transactions increase then, eventually, demand will decrease. I don\u2019t see how EIP 1559 affects transaction costs. Transactions costs are purely a function of demand for transactions. Moving low value traffic to level-2 is the way to reduce level-1 congestion.   We don\u2019t really know what will happen to demand, as our users are not the only ones using the network.  I agree that higher costs will likely reduce demand, but let me elaborate on the real point I wanted to make about our users. gas * gwei = tx cost Since gwei is ETH, if we increase the cost of ETH, then we increase the cost of gwei, thus increasing the cost of a transaction.  The more expensive transactions are, the more users get priced out of the network.  Therefor, an increase in the price of transactions will lead to less user participation in Maker.  At very least because we will need to increase the dust as transactions get more expensive and auctions cost more to clear.  Less participation in Maker isn\u2019t just abstractly bad, we need market participation to balance the peg, and the more distributed this participation the better for risk. I will also point out that, we do not currently have an L2 strategy that is beyond the idea phase.  Perhaps a more deflationary ETH that leads to higher transaction costs will make L2 our number one priority, but I believe deflationary ETH will hurt us before it helps us. ",
