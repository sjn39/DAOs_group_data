It is my understanding that each Core Unit will have one or more Multi-Sigs where approved budgeted funds are deposited. In MIP 47 there is mentioned an active registry of approved Multi-Sigs. Such a registry would be a great start to track the costs of the Core Units, but is this register available for anyone to see? ",

I have seen both the budget simulator and the Dune Analytics dashboard before but noted that there was almost no expenses in 2021 in the dashboard.
