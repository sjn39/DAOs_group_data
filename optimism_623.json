Cycle 11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 29 and Growth Experiments 31 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee: YES I understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a \u201cno sale rule,\u201d as explained in this post, and I have read the terms of the rule: YES Project Details What are you building? Okse Wallet & Okse Visa Card are a decentralized finance system, built to revolutionize the financial market. Okse Wallet & Card allows only the owner to access and spend their cryptocurrency without counter-party risk in over 60 million shops worldwide. Load your card with crypto and spend it anywhere visa is accepted. You can also use Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay with your Virtual Crypto Debit Card. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed? Okse has been live since September 2022 and gained 4,500 Users within 2 just months. These are people who are using our cards as KYC verified members. With 12,000 Users our business model will generate positive revenue which leads to the first success. Our target for 2023 is 100,000+ Users. December 2022, we lost our card provider in the US due to the damage from FTX and the regulatory changes in the US Market. We signed with a new card provider which is now integrated and allows us to operate in 170+ countries with virtual and physical debit cards. Excluded Countries: OKSE Support   Afghanistan   Barbados   Ghana   Haiti   Iran   Iraq   Jamaica   Jordan   Malta   Mauritius   Morocco   Nicaragua   Pakistan   Romania   Syria   Trinidad Tobago   Uganda   North Korea   How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: We have currently 4,500 active KYC verified Users.  Screenshot 2023-03-14 at 7.49.04 PM942\u00d7674 70.5 KB  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: We have the integrated Okse Cashback System (similar to crypto.com) which gives you as a user, up to 6% cashback of your spent amount in Okse. The system is not turned on until now because we do not have enough liquidity in the market for our Okse token; which would lead to an instant price drop before the positive impact from Okse purchases could start. With the grant we could finally create our Liquidity Pair with OKSE/OP with enough liquidity to activate the cashback on the Optimism blockchain which would move the majority of our users to the Optimism blockchain. The cashback can only be activated on a chain which has enough liquidity. Why should users buy Okse after we turn on the Cashback System? To receive cashbacks and to increase your daily spending limit (up to 50,000 $) you need to stake Okse at different Levels. 50% of our total supply is allocated for the cashback system, which gets released over 36 months as available allocation and currently remains untouched.  Screenshot 2023-03-14 at 7.54.19 PM1332\u00d7239 17.6 KB   Screenshot 2023-03-14 at 8.01.13 PM1853\u00d71039 93.8 KB  Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Within the next 12 months we plan to have a minimum of 25,000 (6 month 10,000) active users on the Optimism blockchain. First off, we target our existing users with the cashback as explained above. If you as a user receive cashback only when you use the Optimism blockchain, you will use the optimism blockchain. After everything that happened with FTX, Celsius and other bigger crypto companies, people are scared to use a centralised system for their crypto card payments. We have seen a significant increase in our users since the FTX drama. We have a big network of KOLs which helps us to spread the information and also a big community and following which is just waiting for the cashback activation. Because even if users are scared of centralised systems, if they get cashback on crypto.com and not from Okse, they still consider the company with the cashback in some cases. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: Every active user has for the following on-chain transaction:   Deposit into the debit card contract   Select the payment currency   Pay your monthly subscription fee   Payment transaction / card deposit   Average transactions per User per month:   15 payment transactions   6 card contract deposits   2 payment currency changes   1 monthly subscription fee payment   15 payments * 2 exchange transactions   Total average transaction per User per month: 54 Calculated only on our active users, we would reach monthly 243,000 transactions based on user interaction. If we consider the minimum expected 25,000 Users within 12 months, we are talking about 1.35 Million on-chain transactions per month. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:   Demo: Vimeo Live Video   Website: Website   Twitter: Twitter   Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord   Github: Github   Technical/Economic Documentation: Whitepaper   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We\u2019ve integrated Optimism into the Okse Card already, also into the Okse Wallet. But the wallet integration is not yet activated, because we talked with the Optimism Team and decided to apply for the grant first. Considering we get the grant, we could launch with a big announcement and the cashback integration in place, which would lead to an instant boom in growth for both Okse and Optimism.

Please link to code audits (if any): Audit Github Team Who are your founders?: Tobias, CEO & Founder Army 2008 - 2010 Finance & Insurance Business 2010 - 2016 Crypto since 2016 Twitter Tobias Eljaboom, CMO & Co-Founder Crypto KOL and Crypto Investor since 2013 Twitter Eljaboom Rohit CTO Crypto since 2016 Twitter Rohit We have a total of 12 developers in our team. The Team is based in Dubai, China and India. What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? We\u2019ve built things together for 6+ years in the crypto industry. It took us 1.5 years to develop what we have + to get the Visa & Mastercard approvals. We are ready to give it our all to make Okse a success. Is this your first Web3 project?: If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): We built JulSwap in the past, which is still active and will soon release our cross-chain exchange which includes optimism. JulSwap Github JulSwap Web Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 250,000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: We bring not just users who are really using blockchain to the Optimism team; we also bring the option for the existing and future Optimism users to use & spend OP and other OP based tokens in more than 170 countries, and at over 60 Million merchants worldwide as payment. Roadmap and Distribution Plan   Placing DEX liquidity for cashback activation   Announcement of OP integration and cashback activation   Marketing campaign for the cashback   October / November 10,000 active users OP   Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:   200,000 OP (based on the grants release) + the equivalent of Okse on the OP chain, into DEX liquidity   Activating Optimism chain   Using 50,000 OP (based on the grants release) as liquidity for the pre payment for our payment processor (we need to pre finance all users\u2019 payments for a few seconds until the blockchain transaction arrives)   Currently our product is already finished and live. Our roll out process is very small and needs the support to grow and to expand. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 2):   On chain liquidity 200,000 OP in trading pair OKSE/OP directly after approval (75%)   Payment processor liquidity 50,000 OP directly after approval (25%)   We are not requesting the grant to run our business, rather to grab this opportunity to grow Okse and Optimism bigger than ever. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: Instantly, as described above. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: The next benchmark for us is 12,000 active users within 2023, because then we\u2019ll be revenue positive and all costs covered. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: We can roll out on the Optimism chain without the full grant payment. But overall the achievement increase if we activate the cashback with more liquidity. The cashback as we can see with crypto.com as well, is essential to grow massively. If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We will not distribute the OP tokens to the users. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): To ensure the lockup and vesting timelines we locked the Okse tokens with the total supply from 1,000,000,000 Okse as following: Ecosystem allocation (150,000,00 Okse - 20% TGE = 120,000,000 Okse) Contract: Ecosystem Timeline: 01st of September 2022 - 36 months vesting linear Spend to earn allocation (500,000,000 Okse) Contract: Cashback Timeline: 01st of September 2022 - 36 months vesting linear Team allocation (200,000,000 Okse) Contract: Team Timeline: 01st of September 2022 - 12 months cliff & 36 months vesting linear Advisor allocation (50,000,000 Okse) Contract: Advisor Timeline: 01st of September 2022 - 12 months cliff & 36 months vesting linear Private Sale allocation (91,600,000 Okse) Contract: Private Sale Timeline: 01st of September 2022 - 6 months cliff & 36 months vesting linear Lockup & Vesting Smart Contract Audit:   github.com   Okseio/smart-contact-audit/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Okse-TokenVesting-v1.0.pdf     This file is binary. show original      Okse Token: $0.07 | Okse (OKSE) Token Tracker | BscScan Okse Card Contract BSC: Card Contract Okse Token Optimism (celer bridge): Celer Bridge Okse Card contracts Optimism (deployed but not activated as described): CashBackManager 0xA1AD368Cfb884F499F1379Ac51FF57424fA07C90 Converter 0x41f5391b474bFB3688acA4ea3e6BEBD8aBE7838c LevelManager 0xC23CF0AB5A879052b81f3fa5E398F969Fc0AE433 LimitManager 0xfA3E7d864cf426381aF1A990FD2E19d56b03dF33 MarketManager 0x33fb5277D65Eaf00c88bA279e502805f5ac8bb88 OkseCard 0x44Ae36cB7Ec1c8B3f2560a4C6ade11610F76FF91 Optimism Relationship We have a telegram group with Vivian, Smit, Binji and Tarun Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so, how?:   Use OP and OP based tokens at over 60 Million merchants globally to make payments   Increase User and transaction numbers   Provide non-custodial debit card solutions   Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Because more and more fiat off-ramps are falling out and Okse provides the possibility to be the off-ramp while holding crypto in a non-custodial way. Is your project Optimism Native?: No its multi-chain, but the cashback as described is inactive on all other chains and can be only activated on chains with enough liquidity. This is why we request the grant. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: YES I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: YES ",
