                    "content": "Hi @bit, In November we held a poll, called Poll: Migration Risk Construct Proposal which outlined the debt ceiling buffers for SAI and DAI, specifically: \u201cWe recommend a continuous 10-20 million Sai buffer.\u201d and \u201cFor the MCD Eth debt ceiling, we propose 50 million, to be raised when needed. As the Sai supply migrates, the SCD outstanding supply is reduced. The debt ceiling should then be lowered to allow for simultaneous increases in the MCD debt ceiling. However, a minimum supply of Sai as a liquidity buffer for market makers should be kept intact, even as the maximum Sai debt ceiling goes down.\u201d Our weekly Risk and Governance calls always touch on the topic of Debt Ceiling changes by our risk team, and so far I think the community have been satisfied with the bounds we have introduced - for example this week we are polling for a 25M increase to Dai and a 25M decrease to Sai Debt Ceilings. My personal perspective is that plus/minus 25M bounds are sufficient without the need for calling out specific values due to the fluctuation in liquidity, not to mention the overhead of additional polls/executive votes. If you have an alternative view regarding Debt Ceilings values, please do feel free to share, thanks! ",

I have been wondering if this liquidity attack cyrus spoke of is a fixed number or a percentage and how the risk analysis teams look at this issue.   I think it would help us decide the step sizes on the DC\u2019s both up and down. Generally I\u2019m going to go with what the risk teams come up with.   I will add my .02DAI in chat with cyrus and leave it at that.    It is only if I disagree with direction of something I will speak out but havn\u2019t seen too much issues.  $125 vs 120 sounds fine.
