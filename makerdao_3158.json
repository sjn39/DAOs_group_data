Both ETH-A and ETH-B are in a spot where increasing the DC is questionable, as the protocol might end up with losses in case of another wave of liquidations. Still, we need to anticipate that DAI is popular and people want to leverage their ETH. @Primoz came up with the idea of creating a new vault-type for ETH with a lower LR, which will highly reduce the risk of the protocol losing money on liquidations, while on the other hand offering lower SF for people who want to stay heavily overcollateralized. This signal is about finding out if the community wants the risk team to come up with a proposal for a ETH-based vault type with a higher LR and a lower SF.  Pros  more DAI in circulation another hopefully valuable addition to our portfolio for risk-averse people willing to mint DAI less risky for the protocol than ETH-A   Cons  some work for the smart contracts team, as this is not only configuration   Should we add a new ETH-based vault type with higher LR and lower SF?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Step Poll will run until January 28th and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary. If the domain teams feel this should run shorter so it can be implemented earlier, I will update here accordingly. ",

ETH-A DC still has some buffer left before it becomes too dangerous to increase it further. We are lucky that ETH-A Vaults are well collateralized on average, but should this metric become worse, I will recommend implementing ETH-C and limiting ETH-A DC. I assume there are concerns about ETH-A integrations of other DeFi protocol, but this is exactly the case why we should be having this discussion sooner than later, because we can not just simply assume ETH-A DC has no limit. ETH-C might be a bit uncompetitive in DeFi but Maker is the only platform (afaik) that allows users to unwind during 1h OSM delay, which means sophisticated users can afford to maintain their CR closer to LR.

One thing that i don\u2019t get about this CR > LR idea is how do you ensure that people keep their vaults collateralized in that way if you don\u2019t liquidate them? Sure you can enforce them to put in a certain amount of collateral initially but what happens when the price goes down and the vault ends up below the CR? My guess is that overtime the CRs trend down to the LR anyway and you have the same situation as today, but that is just me hypothesizing. You could maybe start charging an \u201cundercollaterlized fee\u201d or something, but it seems like more contract work. ",
