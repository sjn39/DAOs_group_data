                    "content": "  MMM Workstream  Season 14 Budget Proposal, Revised as of 5 May 2022  This is a renewal proposal for the MMM workstream requesting budgetary funds for Season 14 (1 May 2022 through 31 July 2022).  tl;dr The efforts of the Memes, Merch, & Marketing workstream continue! For the first season, all Gitcoin marketing contributors & efforts will be unified under this DAO workstream. Our highest priority of Season 14 will be to maximize the impact of Grants 2.0 and marketing GR14. The MMM workstream is requesting a total of 152,912 GTC for Season 14. ( Update: This is a decrease of 9% from the original S14 proposal. See detailed request and changes below.) Our focus this season is on the following four objectives:  Lay the foundation to reposition Gitcoin as the premier ecosystem building & funding protocol Increase awareness & affinity for public goods funding & Gitcoin\u2019s role in it Elevate the Gitcoin brand experience Establish systems, processes and practices to shape a thriving MMM and GitcoinDAO community   Season 13 Recap The MMM workstream made extensive progress in Season 13 in our effort to establish Gitcoin as the world\u2019s preeminent community of web3 builders, building for the public good. We outlined this progress initially in the April workstream accountability report. Here is the full list of key highlights & learnings from Season 13. Objective 1: Build Gitcoin\u2019s lean, mean web3 marketing machine  Led awareness & marketing efforts for Grants Round 13, our second biggest round yet with over $1.4M raised from 16k contributors with 300k contributions by the community Planned, designed, and executed email marketing plan during GR13 and across the rest of S13, achieving a record-breaking 9 email campaigns, 6500 clicks to grants and over 9000 grants added to carts Drove over 3M impressions, 1.3M profile visits, and added 10k new followers on main Twitter handle Created web analytics tracking for GR13 to track conversions and track our impact  Objective 2: Shape and grow a leading web3 brand  Planned and executed a sold-out Schelling Point public goods conference at DevConnect Amsterdam Selected and onboarded a PR partner to shape Gitcoin\u2019s external perception & grow global media presence Established cross-DAO partnerships and ran two successful community events (Memepalooza); the most recent one had 200 attendees in partnership with 1Hive & KlimaDAO Major improvements to content archiving tool, memes.party, over 700 memes uploaded Launched the first version of Regen vs Degen card game during Schelling Point Denver Ongoing delivery of great regen vibes through GitcoinDAO Twitter   Objective 3: Support GitcoinDAO & workstream initiatives  Launched steward Health Cards 2.0 with new features and a complete revamp of the backend Launched the Gitcoin Primer to assist with onboarding of new contributors to the DAO Published two Dune Dashboards (Governance & Financials, Governor Alpha & Timelock) to increase transparency and accountability of our community of stewards and workstreams Posted weekly GitcoinDAO Digest-newsletter on the forum & email with over 400 weekly readers Supported DAO workstream & group events with marketing and designs Launched and hosted 3 unique \u2018Can Devs Do Something?!\u2019 developer meet-ups (Lisbon, Denver & Amsterdam) Created a dozen header images for Notion and Discord, minted POAPs for events and created visuals for onboarding and navigation. Created new logos and branding for Builderband and FDD. Supported Moonshot Collective comms via a partnership-raid  Objective 4: Grow & support team health and accountability  Empowered workstream contributors by soliciting and integrating feedback on WS structure (received from our RadicalxChange Voice event) Developed and shared updated workstream OS including contributor levels, substreams, project processes need to be evolved and documented in the upcoming season Began exploring Dework as an onboarding tool for contributors curious about MMM and Gitcoin Collaboration with DAO Ops to improve and streamline our contributor compensation   Continuing Activities and Proposed Budget This Season, we are continuing to use OKRs for workstream priority setting and planning, with 4 key objectives laid out below: 1. Lay the foundation to reposition Gitcoin as the premier ecosystem building & funding protocol Key results:  Drive customer & audience research on identity, sybil protection & broader ecosystem funding solutions Create product positioning, packaging, and promotional marketing materials to support protocol vision Steer Gitcoin toward a protocol future through effective and timely launch of identity module Prepare comprehensive SEO audit of all website assets & recommend actions to drive growth for Grants 2.0 vision  2. Increase awareness & affinity for public goods funding & Gitcoin\u2019s role in it Key results:  Grow awareness and comprehension of grants and public goods among funders & grantees in Grants Round 14 Increase diversity and frequency of Gitcoin representatives at industry events Elevate Gitcoin\u2019s profile within the global media narrative through proactive media outreach & reactive media opportunities from PR/Comms initiative Build the profiles of Gitcoin leadership, positioning us as key commentators and reliable and trustworthy thought-leaders in crypto, DAO, open source & fundraising ecosystems Reinforce Gitcoin as a leader in the Web3 ecosystem, and help Gitcoin transition from an Ethereum funding solution to an internet-native protocol for building & funding ecosystems via a comprehensive content strategy Support Holdings team in marketing virtual events business Upgrade and democratize our email marketing platform & migrate to a comprehensive marketing automation suite  3. Elevate the Gitcoin brand experience Key results:  Support all marketing campaigns, including GR14, with top-notch marketing assets, creative and copywriting Complete analysis and scoping of visual identity refresh Full audit & clean up for gitcoin.co website & other marketing assets Update existing schwag store & innovate using token-gating plug-ins Drive alignment on overall IRL event strategy & begin planning for S15 IRL events Develop visuals for workstream to help onboarding, navigation and proposals  4. Establish systems, processes and practices to shape a thriving MMM and GitcoinDAO community Key results:  Build OS framework to revamp a minimum of 3 quadrants (Workflow, Information, Authority, Measurement) Define and communicate a clear onboarding process for new contributors & implement contributor health measurements Define and implement bottoms-up OKR processes with the MMM contributors by July 10th Expand connections and collaborations with workstreams; designate an MMM point of contact for each workstream Build Gitcoin community & shape community-first vibes via hosting and promoting virtual events such as Weekly Syncs, Memepalooza, and other events Increase transparency & awareness of key DAO activities via the GitcoinDAO Digest   Season 14 Budget Requirements     Budget Category Description & Assumptions Amt USD Amt GTC Decrease Amt USD     Content Social media, blog, newsletters, copywriting $72,400 13,125 $16,740   Brand & creative Production & brand design, IRL event marketing, web development, brand strategy $131,050 23,825 $6,500   Community experience Gitcoin community events, artist relations, DAO transparency $86,100 14,900 $4,100   Growth Email, SEO, marketing campaign management, website migration, analytics and reporting $46,725 8,500    Product marketing Market research, product positioning, packaging, launch support for grants protocol $30,000 5,500    PR/Comms In partnership with YAP Global: comms strategy, DAO reputation management, leadership reputation building $30,000 5,500    Ops, Strategy & Governance OS facilitation & design, stream goals & strategy, recruitment & onboarding, workstream project management, cross-stream relations $108,360 19,700 $22,218   Holdings & virtual events Marketing support for virtual events business including content strategy, email marketing, social media support $0 0 $30,000   Totals  $504,635 91,751 $79,558     Budget Ask       USD GTC     Season 14 original ask  $584,193 106,216   Reduction  $79,558 14,465   Season 14 updated ask  $504,635 91,751   60 day reserves (=\u2154 of the S14 need)  $336,389 61,161   Current treasury balance  $12,000 2180   Amount Requested from Treasury  $841,024 152,912    Note: A denomination in dollar amount will be prioritized in budget proposals over GTC - if the spot price assumed at the time of posting ($5.50) this document on the forum changes between then and when the budget gets proposed on-chain, the GTC amount will be readjusted to reflect the dollar amount above. GTC are rounded values. Current signers of the MMMultisig are: Brittney, Fred, Sean, Jonas, Ceres, ChrisDean & Simona. ( Update: ChrisDean and Simona were added to the MMM multisig after the original S14 proposal. )  Amendments from original S14 proposal  Lowered budget by approximately 3% (by eliminating a 5% buffer applied to most substream detailed budgets). We will use workstream reserves to account for any unexpected budget overages. Decreased budget in Content by 23% to account for time-to-hire and a slightly slower team ramp-up given MMM-steward responsibilities Decreased budget in Ops, Strategy & Governance by xxx to to account for more realistic time-to-hire and a slightly slower team ramp-up given current MMM-steward responsibilities Removed virtual events marketing support budget (negotiating for Holdings to cover this expense as part of asset transfer).   Clarifications based on Steward feedback  In response to feedback from @kyle re: \u201cCommunity Experience doesn\u2019t feel like a fit when DAO Ops currently claims to support community experience\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that the work MMM sets out to do differs from the work DAOOps is working on. Our focus is on building a stronger and more engaged community through events, bounties, visuals, explainers and videos. We are also actively working on creating spaces for cross-DAO activities to take place in an effort to unite communities surrounding GitcoinDAO. We are in active communication with @krrisis regarding intersections between our efforts and will work to keep efforts properly aligned in this and future seasons. In response to feedback from @kyle re: \u201cBrand & Creative feels large for a single season ($137k), but there are few details shared on how this number was amassed\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that the proposed brand budget includes the following components: absorbing the F/T salary of bringing over Holdings\u2019 marketing designer, covering additional F/T and project-based designers, salary for substream lead, outside design studio to assist with brand analysis and scope to inform website refresh, and a supply for bounties and project requests from other workstreams. As outlined in Amendment #1 above, we have reduced budget for this substream by removing the 5% buffer. In response to feedback from @DisruptionJoe re: \u201cthe lack of clear metrics\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that a primary objective for our Growth substream is to improve data visibility, tracking & analytics for campaigns & projects within the MMM workstream. For Season 14, we\u2019re unfortunately not able to make our goals as quantitative as we\u2019d like, but we believe this will continue to improve meaningfully with each season. We hope that progress will be accelerated by moving to a comprehensive, unified marketing automation suite in S14.   Team The MMM workstream will consist of MMM Stewards, Seeders and Peers. Our ambition is to create a welcoming environment into MMM with mobility for talented contributors that want to be more involved.  1000\u00d7574 67.3 KB  You can read more about our initial thoughts on DBI and contributor tiers in this governance post.   Conclusion We\u2019ve come a long way since MMM was first initiated in GR10. Season 14 will be our most ambitious season yet and we\u2019ve worked hard on getting the structures and processes in place to accommodate our larger mandate. We are incredibly excited and humbled by the continued support and look forward to scaling up dramatically to fulfill the tasks we set out to do in this budget over the coming 3 months. We\u2019ve got the momentum going and are ~coordinating~ with our amazing contributors and other workstreams to further Gitcoin\u2019s mission of funding Public Goods! Signed,  Your MMM Stewards  ",

I actually am yet to see any evidence of the work they did covering the event. Happy to review when we have it but may not be needed for S14? It would also be useful to know how many FT and PT contributors this is covering (core and adjacent).     seanmac:  |Holdings & virtual events|Marketing support for virtual events business including content strategy, email marketing, social media support|$30,000|5,500   I think we can discuss this re potentially sponsoring any upcoming ecosystem events and having a presence that way - but this might involve a bigger conversation re where sponsorship funds for ecosystem activations comes from.

I do intend to update my voter guide as we discuss here, but hopefully we can keep the MMM relevant convo in this thread. tl;dr on my current sentiment:  MMM - Requesting a reduction (from 167.7K to 132.5K GTC), the goal is to cut out some of the nice to haves here. PR is likely not necessary at this time, we have a strong narrative and brand but no protocol to announce. Community Experience doesn\u2019t feel like a fit when DAO Ops currently claims to support community experience (lets not double pay, BUT if we are taking this over from PGF, I am supportive of the budget). Holdings and Virtual events can pay for their own marketing, not the DAO. Brand & Creative feels large for a single season ($137k), but there are few details shared on how this number was amassed (I think the new front end website for Gitcoin is in here?). This new number (132K GTC) still honors the reserves that were ratified. One final note, I would like to see diversity in your multisig. All of your signers are core MMM contributors and you are missing your customer\u2019s feedback. FDD has done a good job of shifting how to think about multi signer responsibility (DAO Ops a bit too). These are big budgets that should have more accountability with signers of the funds IMO.  It is clear MMM is really starting to hit its stride and I am inclined to offer funding to really enable them to spread their wings. Memeapoloozas are always great fun (and on par with Public Goods Library calls). The approach to contributor type, and the RFP process we are trialing with a Product Marketer are also great ways for us to explore project based work that keeps the monthly recurring burn low. Overall, I loved seeing the progress in aligning the team, and really delivering on some great events (Schelling point x 2!). As with all other WS proposals, I will just call out that I would for these budgets to be smaller where possible. I want to ensure our burn rate is considered going into S14 and S15. I would love some thoughts from the MMM team on - how might we cut this budget down? Are there areas that can be slowed. To reiterate, this request and feedback is going out to all workstreams. ",

We are gearing up for our biggest season yet, with the absorption of Gitcoin holdings\u2019 marketing. Our highest priority of Season 14 will be to maximize the impact of Grants 2.0 and marketing GR14. The MMM workstream is requesting a total of 152,912 GTC for Season 14. (Update: This is a decrease of 9% from the original S14 proposal. See detailed request and changes below.)

Created new logos and branding for Builderband and FDD. Supported Moonshot Collective comms via a partnership-raid  Objective 4: Grow & support team health and accountability  Empowered workstream contributors by soliciting and integrating feedback on WS structure (received from our RadicalxChange Voice event) Developed and shared updated workstream OS including contributor levels, substreams, project processes need to be evolved and documented in the upcoming season Began exploring Dework as an onboarding tool for contributors curious about MMM and Gitcoin Collaboration with DAO Ops to improve and streamline our contributor compensation   Continuing Activities and Proposed Budget This Season, we are continuing to use OKRs for workstream priority setting and planning, with 4 key objectives laid out below: 1. Lay the foundation to reposition Gitcoin as the premier ecosystem building & funding protocol Key results:  Drive customer & audience research on identity, sybil protection & broader ecosystem funding solutions Create product positioning, packaging, and promotional marketing materials to support protocol vision Steer Gitcoin toward a protocol future through effective and timely launch of identity module Prepare comprehensive SEO audit of all website assets & recommend actions to drive growth for Grants 2.0 vision  2.

Elevate the Gitcoin brand experience Key results:  Support all marketing campaigns, including GR14, with top-notch marketing assets, creative and copywriting Complete analysis and scoping of visual identity refresh Full audit & clean up for gitcoin.co website & other marketing assets Update existing schwag store & innovate using token-gating plug-ins Drive alignment on overall IRL event strategy & begin planning for S15 IRL events Develop visuals for workstream to help onboarding, navigation and proposals  4. Establish systems, processes and practices to shape a thriving MMM and GitcoinDAO community Key results:  Build OS framework to revamp a minimum of 3 quadrants (Workflow, Information, Authority, Measurement) Define and communicate a clear onboarding process for new contributors & implement contributor health measurements Define and implement bottoms-up OKR processes with the MMM contributors by July 10th Expand connections and collaborations with workstreams; designate an MMM point of contact for each workstream Build Gitcoin community & shape community-first vibes via hosting and promoting virtual events such as Weekly Syncs, Memepalooza, and other events Increase transparency & awareness of key DAO activities via the GitcoinDAO Digest   Season 14 Budget Requirements     Budget Category Description & Assumptions Amt USD Amt GTC Decrease Amt USD     Content Social media, blog, newsletters, copywriting $72,400 13,125 $16,740   Brand & creative Production & brand design, IRL event marketing, web development, brand strategy $131,050 23,825 $6,500   Community experience Gitcoin community events, artist relations, DAO transparency $86,100 14,900 $4,100   Growth Email, SEO, marketing campaign management, website migration, analytics and reporting $46,725 8,500    Product marketing Market research, product positioning, packaging, launch support for grants protocol $30,000 5,500    PR/Comms In partnership with YAP Global: comms strategy, DAO reputation management, leadership reputation building $30,000 5,500    Ops, Strategy & Governance OS facilitation & design, stream goals & strategy, recruitment & onboarding, workstream project management, cross-stream relations $108,360 19,700 $22,218   Holdings & virtual events Marketing support for virtual events business including content strategy, email marketing, social media support $0 0 $30,000   Totals  $504,635 91,751 $79,558     Budget Ask       USD GTC     Season 14 original ask  $584,193 106,216   Reduction  $79,558 14,465   Season 14 updated  ask  $504,635 91,751   60 day reserves (=\u2154 of the S14 need)  $336,389 61,161   Current treasury balance  $12,000 2180   Amount Requested from Treasury  $841,024 152,912    Note: A denomination in dollar amount will be prioritized in budget proposals over GTC - if the spot price assumed at the time of posting ($5.50) this document on the forum changes between then and when the budget gets proposed on-chain, the GTC amount will be readjusted to reflect the dollar amount above. GTC are rounded values. Current signers of the MMMultisig  are: Brittney, Fred, Sean, Jonas, Ceres, ChrisDean & Simona. (Update: ChrisDean and Simona were added to the MMM multisig after the original S14 proposal.)  Amendments from original S14 proposal  Lowered budget by approximately 3% (by eliminating a 5% buffer applied to most substream detailed budgets). We will use workstream reserves to account for any unexpected budget overages. Decreased budget in Content by 23% to account for time-to-hire and a slightly slower team ramp-up given MMM-steward responsibilities Decreased budget in Ops, Strategy & Governance by xxx to to account for more realistic time-to-hire and a slightly slower team ramp-up given current MMM-steward responsibilities Removed virtual events marketing support budget (negotiating for Holdings to cover this expense as part of asset transfer).   Clarifications based on Steward feedback  In response to feedback from @kyle re: \u201cCommunity Experience doesn\u2019t feel like a fit when DAO Ops currently claims to support community experience\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that the work MMM sets out to do differs from the work DAOOps is working on. Our focus is on building a stronger and more engaged community through events, bounties, visuals, explainers and videos. We are also actively working on creating spaces for cross-DAO activities to take place in an effort to unite communities surrounding GitcoinDAO. We are in active communication with @krrisis regarding intersections between our efforts and will work to keep efforts properly aligned in this and future seasons. In response to feedback from @kyle re: \u201cBrand & Creative feels large for a single season ($137k), but there are few details shared on how this number was amassed\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that the proposed brand budget includes the following components: absorbing the F/T salary of bringing over Holdings\u2019 marketing designer, covering additional F/T and project-based designers, salary for substream lead, outside design studio to assist with brand analysis and scope to inform website refresh, and a supply for bounties and project requests from other workstreams. As outlined in Amendment #1 above, we have reduced budget for this substream by removing the 5% buffer. In response to feedback from @DisruptionJoe re: \u201cthe lack of clear metrics\u201d, we\u2019d like to clarify that a primary objective for our Growth substream is to improve data visibility, tracking & analytics for campaigns & projects within the MMM workstream. For Season 14, we\u2019re unfortunately not able to make our goals as quantitative as we\u2019d like, but we believe this will continue to improve meaningfully with each season. We hope that progress will be accelerated by moving to a comprehensive, unified marketing automation suite in S14.   Team The MMM workstream will consist of MMM Stewards, Seeders and Peers. Our ambition is to create a welcoming environment into MMM with mobility for talented contributors that want to be more involved.  1000\u00d7574 67.3 KB  You can read more about our initial thoughts on DBI and contributor tiers in this governance post.   Conclusion We\u2019ve come a long way since MMM was first initiated in GR10. Season 14 will be our most ambitious season yet and we\u2019ve worked hard on getting the structures and processes in place to accommodate our larger mandate. We are incredibly excited and humbled by the continued support and look forward to scaling up dramatically to fulfill the tasks we set out to do in this budget over the coming 3 months. We\u2019ve got the momentum going and are ~coordinating~ with our amazing contributors and other workstreams to further Gitcoin\u2019s mission of funding Public Goods! Signed,  Your MMM Stewards  ",

It\u2019s been great to see MMM evolve and see it find a balance between being strategic and objective-driven and still leaving enough room for creativity & bottom-up initiative emergence. For me S13 was a transition season and I hope S14 will be the season MMM truly shows its leadership on all things memes, merchandise & especially marketing. A few random thoughts that pop up:  I hope in the near future we can find some further alignment on terms used (especially you guys being MMM), let\u2019s avoid any and all confusion. Eg the use of the term \u2018community experience\u2019 clearly is confusing. I\u2019m down to let MMM own that term for outward facing events, but then you need to help me come up with a better term for our internal facing community experience.  As you see - even while updated, seeing Bob\u2019s comment - this still causes confusion. Maybe just not use this term and talk about Community Events, and or merge this category with Content? Another and even more blatant example is to talk about MMM Stewards, I think there\u2019s no doubt here that the term is claimed by well, the DAO Stewards. From the graph I understand MMM Stewards are not DAO Stewards focused on MMM but\u2026 core contributors, full time contributors? Why not just call them what they are? Same with the other terms used in that visual?  I\u2019d say just like any other workstream you need to work on simplicity & transparency, and in a way MMM even more, as you are literally responsible for communication.   I\u2019d love to see more ownership on future events org, specifically Schelling Point, and hope we can have a full-time in-house events coordinator, so we can handle this less in \u2018crisis mode\u2019. On virtual events: I think Memepalooza is \u2018fun\u2019 but here as well there should be some more focused output focusing on the Public Goods cause and specifically Gitcoin\u2019s mission. When I see what the Gitcoin Vibes account tweeted as a demonstration of created content I mainly hoped that there was other content that was not tweeted that was \u2026 better. And more value & mission aligned.   I hope more compensation alignment will happen with people ops in DAO Ops. You guys have been running some fantastic experiments but not sure if a lot of these learnings have been shared with the people ops team. We were also severely understaffed here, so that did not help. I hope future experiments, like eg. the mentioned token vesting experiment will happen in coordination with people ops (@loie or someone in her team).   ",

In short, I think this budget strives to do too much. Seeing the plethora of \u201cSupport GitcoinDAO & Workstream Initiatives\u201d outcomes from S13 gives me anxiety - these are pretty scattershot, and while I don\u2019t doubt a lot of them have value, I worry about their prioritization and how some of them might be pulling away from other initiatives. I am reminded of the feedback I shared with DAO Ops around customer focus with respect to \u2018other workstream stuff\u2019; I would love for the CSDO group (or similar forum) to be more involved in prioritization here. I wonder if the S14 list-of-things could be pared down even more. Seeing projects from a complete gitcoin.co website audit, to schwag store updates, to holistic PR strategy make me a bit concerned that the workstream is trying to do too many things at the expense of doing a few important things really well.

Would like to respond here to some of the most recent comments.     griff:  This is one of the most important workstreams! But\u2026 I am missing the \u201cBuy GTC\u201d messaging\u2026 Is that not allowed? I feel like if that were the message\u2026 it would be much easier to justify this kind of spending\u2026 If it\u2019s not allowed, then well\u2026 I have to vote no on this proposal as is\u2026   We have deliberately stayed away from this type of messaging - your initial thought is correct that this type of messaging is a non-goal. To be clear, this does not mean that the marketing workstream has nothing to do with driving value for the DAO\u2026 on the contrary, there is no way for Gitcoin DAO to be successful without market awareness, consideration and usage of our products & services\u2026 this is true both in a world where we have a protocol and in a world where we do not. GTC owners are explicitly \u201cnot a target audience for our marketing team\u201d - we\u2019ve had several internal discussions (including at CSDO) and this is where we landed. IMO, it would be highly unfortunate for a steward to vote against the marketing budget proposal based on this rationale.     krrisis:  I hope in the near future we can find some further alignment on terms used   I agree 100%. This is an area I dove into when I joined Gitcoin in the fall but have stayed away from lately. Standardization of terms, even for internal use, will be even more critical as we launch a protocol. More to come here.     krrisis:  I understand MMM Stewards are not DAO Stewards focused on MMM but\u2026 core contributors, full time contributors? Why not just call them what they are?   Appreciate this feedback. The core marketing team members went with this terminology for S14 bc they felt it more closely aligned with steward leadership - the role we see ourselves playing in shepherding the contributor-led, fully decentralized team we\u2019re seeking to build (rather than terms like \u201ccore\u201d, \u201cleads\u201d or the like). Of course, if it\u2019s confusing for others, we\u2019re happy to revisit for future seasons.     krrisis:  I\u2019d love to see more ownership on future events org, specifically Schelling Point, and hope we can have a full-time in-house events coordinator, so we can handle this less in \u2018crisis mode\u2019.   We agree and are actively working on this. @gloria and I discussed today, and @Pop & I are discussing tomorrow. More info to come here.     krrisis:  On virtual events: I think Memepalooza is \u2018fun\u2019 but here as well there should be some more focused output focusing on the Public Goods cause and specifically Gitcoin\u2019s mission.   Agree here as well. There\u2019s still work to be done to align our community-building initiatives with our core mission. That being said, we\u2019re proud to be leading the way in creating events that bring in new community members such as this one. Focusing on the output that comes out of them is, in a sense, a good problem to have, because it means we\u2019re involving them in co-creating our work.     krrisis:  I hope more compensation alignment will happen with people ops in DAO Ops. You guys have been running some fantastic experiments but not sure if a lot of these learnings have been shared with the people ops team. We were also severely understaffed here, so that did not help. I hope future experiments, like eg. the mentioned token vesting experiment will happen in coordination with people ops   We\u2019d love this! We\u2019re tackling a lot in this season, however, so we may be crunched for time, but as always we will do our best to work in public and share learnings so that we as workstream leads can learn from each others wins and challenges as much as possible.     annika:  I support this budget as is and will be voting \u2018yes\u2019 - I think the amount requested, though slightly higher than I\u2019d hope for, is within the realm of reasonable, and I believe the work MMM does is mission-critical to the DAO.   We appreciate this and are grateful for your vote of confidence, @annika!     annika:  Seeing projects from a complete gitcoin.co website audit, to schwag store updates, to holistic PR strategy make me a bit concerned that the workstream is trying to do too many things at the expense of doing a few important things really well.   This is prescient feedback and also something that I have been thinking about pretty much every single day. We\u2019re really trying to strike a balance in achieving all of the ambitious things that the DAO wants us to do, and doing the things that really matter. We expect to get better each season at prioritizing the things that are working and cutting the things that are not, using data as much as possible to make these decisions, and making the decisions as publicly and collaboratively as we can. It\u2019s no easy feat, but we\u2019re up for the challenge! In closing One thing I\u2019d like to emphasize (but left out of the official proposal request) is that we are specifically focused on moving decision-making, context, production, and process from the core MMM team to the newly formed marketing substreams. In addition, we\u2019re looking to bring on trusted part-time contributors - not full-time hires - to run important marketing disciplines like content and product marketing. They\u2019ll be expected to deliver top quality work & also build systems & processes that allow us to onboard, retain, and manage flexible, lean teams of regular contributors. This will take some time to get humming, but I believe strongly that it will ultimately lead to better results with more efficiencies than traditional marketing orgs. Thank you for your careful consideration of this budget & for all the work you do as stewards of the DAO. We notice it, it is appreciated, and it\u2019s an essential part of fulfilling the incredible mission to which we all are dedicating our precious time. Onward! ",
