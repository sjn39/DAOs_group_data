                    "content": "Summary MaskDAO proposes a token swap between $MASK and $GTC to further diversify both treasuries and strengthen the interaction between our communities. Mask Network Introduction Mask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We have since integrated decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, and decentralized file storage and sharing to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0. Mask & Gitcoin We value Gitcoin as our Developer Community Partner, a community of builders, creators, and protocols at the center of open web ecosystems. Mask Network has been an active supporter of Gitcoin since GR6 and has posted 44 bounties and spent 33ETH since then. In the upcoming GR11 and OpenDeFi, Mask Network will continue to provide financial support to encourage more developers to participate in the future of blockchain and open source development ecosystem. Recently, Mask Network has started the SocialFi Alliance with Gitcoin and other partners from DeFi Apps, ecosystem partners, and community & media partners. In the future, we will launch more social DeFi projects for social network users, promote the connection between Web2.0 and Web3.0, guide more top Internet social platform users to access DeFi, and, for the long term, we are dedicated to promoting the large-scale application of Web3.0. It\u2019s worth noting that the integration of the dHEDGE, PoolTogether, GoodGhosting, and Augur plugins on Mask extension were all completed by developers in the Mask Network community during the Gitcoin Grants Round 10 Hackathon. This is a very promising sneak peek of the decentralized Mask community we would love to see, where community developers integrate decentralized applications to the Mask extension, and gradually form a Mask decentralized app ecosystem with thousands of DApps, built mostly with community developer contribution. In addition to funding recent rounds, Mask\u2019s plugin also supported the Gitcoin project\u2019s Twitter presence last June. Once the Mask plugin is installed, the Gitcoin project in the post is automatically recognized and a donation portal is created. Users can then donate directly to support the project without leaving the Twitter page. This will greatly simplify the process of raising money for projects on Gitcoin (add project to cart, checkout with zkSync\u2026), and increase the exposure of these great Web 3.0 projects. Mask Token $MASK is the native token of MaskDAO. The DAO is the owner of the Mask Ecosystem. $MASK holders are members of MaskDAO and possess ownership of the Mask Ecosystem through the DAO. As the native token, $MASK serves as incentives to facilitate governance. Each $MASK represents one vote. Overtime, Mask Network team and ecosystem members will develop more products and services that would accrue value to $MASK. Motivation We believe that the token swap enables us to:   Deepen bonds between our communities   Diversify our treasuries   Provide governance power in each other\u2019s community   Specification Execution at current 30-day moving average prices with no discount. $MASK 30-Day MA = $ $GTC 30-Day MA = $ $ ____ notional value, paid in $GTC and $MASK. $GTC <> $MASK ",

For deepening bonds, Mask has been one of the earlier and largest bounty issuer and donor for Gitcoin. Gitcoin bounty hackers literally finished more than half of the dapp integrations in the Mask ecosystem, and we expect the % to go even higher as we grow to hundreds if not thousands of integrated dapps. I think that\u2019s a very unique position to be in. The benefit is mutual and worth a special tie like token swap. As for treasury diversification, I think although we are both in web 3 space, we are still very different business. Mask product is in general consumer facing while Gitcoin is more developer focused. Our distinctive value props put us in good position to cooperate yet remain fundamentally different to provide enough diversification value and upside potential. ",

The term treasury diversification also needs some clarification. Lots of companies or projects raised a few stable rounds before, so it has decent amount of stables or even cash that may not even belong to the dao yet. So the point of treasury diversification here is usually not getting more stables but getting some partner projects\u2019 token that has good upside too. At least that\u2019s the case from a Mask team member stand point. Using the correlation factor here might be a bit misleading. Side note 1, Gitcoin treasury does have some animal coins? Side note 2, rai is a decent choice since it grows with ETH price and much more stable Side note 3, ohm is totally different, not stable not pegged, but amazing asset to have. I\u2019m an OHMie and we are in talk with them as well.1 ",

Diversity treasury does not sound attractive to me; Would love to see more benefit about point 1 and 3 discussed.
