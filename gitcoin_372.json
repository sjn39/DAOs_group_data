Nearly every channel and project i saw, which showed something about gitcoin or was involved in GR\u00b4s, said in their channels, its better to spend a small amount than a big amount, because of the QF formula, but the formula was mostly not more described, how it works. i think, like for me, the most contributors which saw these, were thinking its better to spend less than more for each specific project. Maybe there is some kind of confusion, even for me also. ",

I am one of these guys, who came here, spend some minimal donations to many projects and did, \u201cwhat i was told to\u201d\u2026 the thing is - in my eyes Gitcoin is much much more as it appears to be. I am no webdeveloper or programmer, but thanks of gitcoin i am doing quests and get in touch with the crypto- and blockchainworld in a playful way. The structure that Gitcoin evolves regarding on our societystructure is indicatory.  In the end: When i came in touch with Gitcoin (and i just understood it only partitionally) i realised that if there is a gateway to this world i want to live in, than Gitcoin is giving a direction to. It depends how we will continue, but i thought to invite more people to Gitcoin, making it more public, builting groups and show them how they need to work\u2026  in my eyes Gitcoin is the best tool i ever saw, to focus our energy so that every participant get the best out of it.
