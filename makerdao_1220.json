                    "content": "Given the ongoing liquidity risk of Dai in an uncertain market, both the community and members of the Maker Foundation have been making noise in the official chat about onboarding USDC as collateral as an emergency measure to help mitigate this liquidity risk. Naturally this would need to be confirmed by governance, and go through an executive vote, but at this stage the Foundation is making the technical preparations to make this possible. I will be updating this initial post with pros, cons and points to consider presently. Please feel free to share any thoughts in the meantime. See this previous discussion for an overview of why this is useful: What's the point of adding stablecoins as collateral? A call is planned in which the Foundation Dev Team will be going through the code on the collateral adaptor for USDC. It\u2019s currently slated for 4pm CET / 11 am ET / 3pm UTC Edit: Call has now concluded. Recording is available here. Proposal from Cyrus is now live, complete with community polling: Proposal for Collateral Onboarding of USDC  Pros   Helps to create Dai liquidity and push the Dai peg back towards $1. The mechanism of this looks like: Lock USDC \u2192 Mint Dai \u2192 Sell for USDC \u2192 Repeat.   Will allow Vault Holders to close their Vaults without eating the loss on the Dai peg being high against USD.   Will allow keepers that want to participate in the ongoing FLIP auctions to acquire the Dai they will need for those auctions.   Will allow keepers that want to participate in the coming FLOP auctions to acquire the Dai they will need for those auctions.   PR Response to fixing liquidity might be positive.   Cons   Reduces the \u2018purity\u2019 of Dai as a decentralized stablecoin - Dai is no longer backed entirely by decentralized assets.   Comes with regulatory risk - US Government could decide that dollar-backed stablecoins are not okay.   Comes with \u2018blacklist\u2019 risk - KYC/AMC could result in Circle blacklisting some amount of USDC used as collateral.   PR response due to Dai purity might be negative.   Points to consider   We need to decide on a Stability Fee - Note that this should probably lean towards the higher side, at some point Cyrus will share a risk perspective.   We need to decide on a Liquidation Ratio -  Note that this should probably be lower than ETH\u2019s but should not be so low that a single Vault can mint all the USDC, at some point Cyrus will share a risk perspective.   We need to decide on a Debt Ceiling - Debt Ceiling especially is something that is to some extent more of a governance decision than a risk decision. We need something that is high enough to provide the required liquidity, but not so high that we take on additional risk.   Can we get away without oracles and hard-coding the price of USDC to $1? What are the pros and cons of doing so?   Is the collateral adaptor safe? There likely won\u2019t be time for an audit.   This can be a temporary measure, we can lower the debt ceiling to zero once we feel the crisis has passed. (Note that this does require the crisis to actually pass and people to start opening ETH Vaults again.)   We need to decide on a Liquidation Penalty. As \u2018debt-from-Stability Fees\u2019 increases, Vaults can still be liquidated even if the underlying asset price is stable!   We need to decide on a Lot Size. If liquidations are going to occur, we need a lot size that makes sense for a stablecoin.   Other miscellaneous parameters? There are several of these that all need settings.   ",

                    "content": "I think it\u2019s a good idea to add USDC as collateral, to enable liquidity to be added to the market for emergencies. Currently DAI is trading >1.07, there\u2019s a lot of demand for DAI liquidity. Vaults will be able to lock USDC and mint DAI. They\u2019ll be able to sell the DAI and provide DAI liquidity to the market. Why USDC? USDC has a lot of on chain liquidity and is also integrated with many defi other defi products. Also, DAI/USDC is traded a lot too. Price Oracle will be pegged at $1. They won\u2019t be able to get liquidated from DAI/USDC price movements. My personal thoughts on Variables.  Stability Fees [sf+15%] - So I was initially thinking something lower. Then Cyrus mentioned 10% and made some good points. We generally want this to be mainly used when there is a great need for liquidity, and not used up for slight deviances in the DAI/USDC price or for rate arbitrage in normal circumstances. This could possibly raised higher, in emergencies compound has a 20% sf fee and dydx has a 50% fee. But unlike those, you can actually mint DAI with this maker facility. Vaults should still be able to profit as they shouldn\u2019t be holding for a year. The main thing is that we don\u2019t want the DC to be used on peg arbitrage when the peg is slightly out of sync, also historically it\u2019s been very normal to have a 5% spread between USDC deposit rates and DAI deposit rates. Collateralization Ratio: 120-130% - This requires that vaults use some of their own capital to put on these trades. We want to require capital, so that someone with low capital can\u2019t just utilize the entire facility. Also we don\u2019t want them to get instantly liquidated from sf fees at a loss for maker. At 120-130%, vaults will be able to lever up 3.33-5x. Blacklist risk - This might not be that big of a problem. Compound also uses USDC and they might have an understanding with coinbase. Definitely not a problem in the short term. Debt Ceiling - 10-20m - this is a tradeoff between risk and liquidity. There is probably more than 10m in liquidity demand. The debt ceiling could be greatly lowered later (2m?) when the crisis pases.  I think even with a stability fee of 15%+ and a Collateralization ratio of 120-130%, there will still be a lot of demand for this facility when DAI liquidity is needed (current situation). ",

Agree on @LongForWisdom\u2019s reasoning on debt ceiling (as required by liquidity, modulated by risk) No strong opinions on SF/CR/penalty/lotsize. I\u2019m very worried about fixing the oracle to $1. Unless USDC/$ convertibility is trivial and has infinite liquidity (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case), if e.g. USDC starts trading below par anyone could prop it back up at the cost of bringing down the DAI price (which might have been perfectly happy at $1). I\u2019d much prefer an actual oracle, if doable quickly. Otherwise we should strongly commit to getting rid of the fixed $1 as soon as possible.  ",

Yes, supply from the side of the vault owners was limited at times, but the main issue was extremely low participation in the liquidation auctions themselves causing valuations that were too low. If you talk to the liquidated owners, you will find that they are mainly frustrated about the amount of lost collateral (for various reasons\u2026), not the liquidation itself. Contrary to what seems to be the current belief, I\u2019d say that the problem is therefore not that we didn\u2019t have enough DAI, it is that DAI users were in fact trying to participate but unable to due to various reasons (no UX available, limited knowledge about the keeper system, 500 ETH fragments are simply too high a barrier for many people, etc.). People were begging for ways to get to participate and add liquidity! I am aware of the current efforts to solve this, but in my view we ought to first explore removals of these obvious barriers to the otherwise well-designed auction system first. As to the USDC proposal itself, there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system \u2026 Lastly, I echo the sentiment that I am in this project for it\u2019s pure decentralized nature and would not want to see it becoming inter-mixed with USDC. If it were, I would rather just want to stick with USDC altogether. ",

                    "content": "Given the context of this collateral onboarding: ensuring there is adequate liquidity for Dai in the upcoming MKR auction, I support fixing the price feed from Dai to USDC. The price feed for USDC can always be changed later on (taking the governance delay into account) and this offloads a huge amount of complexity for on boarding USDC today. The community can set a target to replace USDC\u2019s oracles in say 21 days. At this point a governance vote could either remove the collateral from MCD or replace the oracles. Maker is trying to set up an auction for ~5.76M DAI in the coming days. For a sufficient amount of participants in an auction, this will lockup a multiple of that amount. However every DeFi protocol that encourages locking up Dai is reducing liquidity in the market. There are currently 37M Dai in the DSR (2M in Chai) and the uniswap liquidity pool has over 1.5M Dai. All of these won\u2019t necessarily become liquidity to help with Dai demand even if Dai trades at an even higher premium than right now. We could very well see Dai going up to $1.1 again during the auction which puts an additional exchange risk on all of the keepers and will likely get priced into the MKR price (an additional dillution of MKR). @jiecut\u2019s point I think is important:   Collateralization Ratio: 120-125% - This requires that vaults use some of their own capital to put on these trades. We want to require capital, so that someone with low capital can\u2019t just utilize the entire facility. Also we don\u2019t want them to get instantly liquidated from sf fees at a loss for maker. At 120-125%, vaults will be able to lever up 4-5x.   Without overcollateralizing USDC backed vaults, someone borrowing right at the liquidation threshold and subsequently triggering a liquidation will put additional strain on keepers. ",

                    "content": "I think using a $1 price for USDC, at least initially is reasonable. USDC is instantly convertible at Coinbase 1:1 for USD.  Any deviation is fairly arbitraged away.  Small differences can exist between exchanges due to exchange fees and network fees as well as ability to onboard fiat and fiat located on the exchange.  There is 400-700k of USDC liquidity on Kraken currently within 1% of $1.  As a market maker, with current instant convertibility on coinbase, arbitrage on USDC between other exchanges and coinbase is the easiest game around. With a high enough stability fee, in normal times, USDC will not be used often.  I think a good solution on the debt ceiling is to have it remain above 0, so that USDC can quickly be deployed to bring the peg back to 0 when large deviations happen in the future. A stability fee really depends on encouraging enough participants to enter into vaults.  I can enter into a synthetic CDP on Compound now by depositing USDC and borrowing DAI.  At 100% utilization that rate right now is ~18.4%, though it should drop post the 0.5% stability fee adjustment today.  DAI rates on dydx are much higher.  I think you want the stability fee for USDC to be lower than what borrowers of DAI can get on Compound and other platforms to incentivize people to open new CDPs and for people to have less incentive to lend on compound/dydx with lower utilization.  The question is how quickly will this instability pass and what rate will incentivize enough people to enter into vaults with USDC collateral.  If the peg reverts in a week, then 15% stability fee is fine.  If it reverts in 3 months, at 15%, its not such a good trade. Assuming a $1 peg for USDC and convertibility at coinbase, the real risk to vault holders is the dai peg moving higher (before it hopefully moves lower) and the vaults being undercollateralized and liquidated.  Mark to market losses with the hope that a reversion happens with no liquidation and before enough stability fees are accumulated to make the trade not worth it. ",

Even if we think that Coinbase and Circle act in a benevolent manner now, they are not required to do so in the future. Furthermore, they may not even have as much power and control in the future after onboarding additional entities. We have seen Circle acquire Poloniex. We have seen Tron and Justin Sun take over Poloniex. There is not much standing in the way of other acquisitions, consolidations, and transfers of power happening in this nascent space. A large enough player could effectively buy out Coinbase, Circle, or Centre and have complete control over USDC and subsequently some control over the MKR system.

Bitcoin grew out of this loss of faith and is why a lot of us are here today  and I worry that similar actions will allow for a new entrant to uproot MKR while citing the responses to last week, if they do not play out well. I am 100% willing to change my mind given enough evidence. With that said, my understanding is that the issues at hand are all rectifiable without compromising on the decentralization of the system. The following is my understanding of the issues and potential solutions. Feel free to correct anything I have wrong:  Problem 1 0-bid auctions are happening and forcing vault holders to lose their entire collateral when under-collateralized. Solution 1 Some say this is risk inherent with the system. Given that, there are still many solutions:  Onboard more keepers in order to make the auction system more efficient Be more clear about the potential loss of 100% of your collateral if under-collateralized Lengthen the auction times to allow for additional entrants in times of high gas usage (or other auction mechanism changes that I know are being discussed right now)   Problem 2 DAI is not pegged to $1. Solution 2 Adjust Stability Fees and the DSR so that it levels off over time. This will not be a short-term solution, but will stabilize the system in the long-run. Additionally, given that gasPrices are normalized, dapps are operating nominally, and general diminished hysteria of the crypto markets, I opine that arbitrageurs will continue to level the price by arbing DEXes and the DAI vault system.

                    "content": "Problem 1: Too much Collateral Asset concentration risk - a systemic risk Description: The Dai debt ceiling must increase while the ETH debt ceiling must shrink in order to lessen the concentration risk, which is a systemic risk for MakerDAO.  In a normal scenario, you would think that Dai would trade at a discount to the peg since it is currently undercollateralized (by 5.67m according to whiterabbit).  But in this scenario, I think it is trading at a premium (1.067 as of right now: https://destiner.github.io/Off-the-peg/#/dai/usd) because multiple parties need Dai at the same time: those that want to top-up their vaults, those that want to be keepers, and those that want to participate in the MKR auctions. Solution 1: USDC would allow MakerDAO to increase the Dai debt ceiling and mint new Dai, which will help to rebalance the supply-demand imbalance.  Problem 2:  The upcoming MKT Debt Auction is causing an unnecessary surge in Dai demand Description: The Maker blog announced a date for the MKR Debt Auction but it didn\u2019t announce how much MKR is expected to be auctioned.  Assuming the auction raises ~$5 million and assuming there are 4 bidders, then each bidder much acquire up to ~$5m worth of Dai before March 19th in order to participate and win.  That is up to ~$20m dai that must be acquired.  How much is $20m out of the total Dai liquid supply? My guess it is a lot, enough to continue pressuring Dai higher and higher. Solution 2: Push off the MKR Debt Auction until the Dai debt ceiling is fixed (see solution 1). Maybe I am already saying things that have been discussed elsewhere, I just don\u2019t see it mentioned in this thread. ",

It is difficult but it must be done, otherwise MakerDAO is toast. You can add as many collateral types as you want, they could be short term fixes but mathematically there will always be a shortage of DAI. Every day, some DAI is sent to dead-end addresses or just completely lost, not to mention the under-collateralisation issue. So today, should all users decide to return DAI to their vaults and recover their collateral, there will not be enough DAI to handle this event. Granted, this is an extreme scenario, but the situation will get worse as time passes. You can\u2019t keep relying on new users to create more DAI supply, that\u2019s how Ponzi schemes work! The only fix is to introduce a negative Stability Fee, not just a negative DSR. When the Stability Fee is negative, the DAI that is created should be used to increase the total supply. This would easily balance the market. When the Stability Fee is positive, it keeps functioning as it currently does, i.e. reducing the MKR float. I believe that most of the time, in normal functioning and increasing demand,  the DSR and Stability Fee will be positive, but the they will have to go negative from time to time. This option has to exist. All this is probably currently not allowed or goes against the foundation rules, but this fundamental change has to happen. There is no way around it. Fix or DAI! ",

If you keep only relying on new users to create more DAI, at some point DAI will consistently trade higher than 1 USD, unhinging the peg, and people will lose confidence in it. All Ponzi schemes end badly. A good stablecoin needs to prove it can stay stable forever. This is unfortunately not currently the case for DAI. What I am proposing is that when the Stability Fee is negative, it is paid in DAI, increasing the supply of DAI. When it is positive, it continues to be paid in MKR. It is a shame, because the DAI model is very promising. But personally I will not touch it until it becomes mathematically robust. A Stability Fee that can go negative can achieve that. ",

On the other hand, the divergence of the peg from 1.00 is a natural and inevitable part of the system: it is a soft peg, never precisely at 1.00 (MCD white paper, Abstract). And the governance has been on a constant hustle in the past week, with good results: the top of the 24h VWAP distribution currently sits around 1.02, compared to the 1.05+ values seen during the recent market tumult. As for USDC as collateral, it\u2019s a temporary and admittedly non-ideal option, but also not unorthodox to the ethos of MCD. Collateral inclusion is always an act of gauging risk and striking a balance of risks and liquidity. ",

Yes you can, because economic activity is not a zero-sum game. If a monetary system is a Ponzi scheme, it\u2019s not because of that.     Jiji:  The only fix is to introduce a negative Stability Fee, not just a negative DSR. When the Stability Fee is negative, the DAI that is created should be used to increase the total supply. This would easily balance the market. When the Stability Fee is positive, it keeps functioning as it currently does, i.e. reducing the MKR float.   Interesting. That would be unbacked dai which would initially reduce the system surplus (basically the surplus would pay vault holders for having an open position). But that works only as long the surplus is positive. Once it\u2019s depleted, the deficit would eventually trigger MKR minting and selling, which would actually reduce liquidity (keepers seeking dai to participate in the flop auctions).     LongForWisdom:  There are also alternatives to what you are suggesting with the negative stability fee. If the protocol is able to accurately estimate or identify the amount of \u2018lost dai\u2019 then we could re-create that amount of Dai and allow it to be un-backed by collateral in the system.   You can do that only through thorough identification. If possible, what would essentially happen is that the governance manually identifies addresses where the dai is certainly lost (e.g. the 0x0 address), and make those unavailable for redemption in case of an ES. I believe any other solution would deal a socialized loss to dai holders. ",

If a monetary system is a Ponzi scheme, it\u2019s not because of that   DAI needs to be very robust. The assumption you are making is true over the long term, but there can be periods of time (like during a drawn-out pandemic or a massive catastrophe) when economic activity shrinks. DAI needs to be able to handle these situations. A temporary negative fee and DSR would be a very effective fix. Beats an emergency shutdown!     chaser:  But that works only as long the surplus is positive. Once it\u2019s depleted, the deficit would eventually trigger MKR minting and selling   Of course, once the surplus is depleted, the situation goes back to normal and the Stability Fee can go back to being positive again. In normal times, economic activity is expanding, demand for DAI and ETH is increasing and the Stability Fee and DSR are positive. But in an emergency, they can go negative until normality is restored. People would understand that a negative fee is only temporary and preserves their investments, unlike an ES.     chaser:  If possible, what would essentially happen is that the governance manually identifies addresses where the dai is certainly lost (e.g. the 0x0 address), and make those unavailable for redemption in case of an ES   This is an incomplete fix. An ES is a risk that stays in the back of people\u2019s minds, undermining their confidence in DAI and ETH. It needs to be reduced as much as possible. Thinking outside the box goes a long way. ",
