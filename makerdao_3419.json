Jeff Bezos made around $321 million per day in 2020.  $110M is approximately 5% of Chiliz (CHZ) Market Cap per Coingecko   \u2013 no disrespect to Chiliz, but think about that. And yes, I know it\u2019s hard to market buy 50,000 MKR in the open market, we can also Vote to Fork Maker, but what is stopping an attacker such as Nation-States from accumulating MKR one (1) MKR at a time and cause great damage to DeFi? Or even a Regulator who has a budget larger than $110M (SEC budget: $1.9B)? Honestly, would it cripple the entire DeFi ecosystem? Not sure, but it would set us back a few crypto years.

I believe that setting the ES trigger at different levels adds not only a practical, but cultural implication for when it should be triggered. If it\u2019s low enough for one large holder to trigger (like it is now), there\u2019s an implication that it should be triggered more easily and a greater likelihood that it will be triggered. I think as a community we need to outline explicitly when we believe an ES should be triggered and set the level at a rate that\u2019s in line with the difficulty of our choice. For me personally, the only situation where I would consider triggering ES is one where a bug or hack is causing the protocol to lose its over-collateralization. For instance, if the system is (in aggregate) 250% over-collateralized, I would not consider triggering ES unless 60% of the collateral was at risk or Dai was able to be inflated enough to drag the aggregate collateralization below 100%. I\u2019d also want to know that there was absolutely no other way to solve the problem, but I think that goes without saying. I\u2019m aware that this may be a controversial opinion or even an unpopular one, which is why we need to have this stuff written in stone and voted on in advance - so that whichever actor has the unfortunate responsibility of pulling that trigger (and let\u2019s hope they never do), they can do so with the confidence that the community will not fork them out of the system in a redeployment.

Just to add a note on your comment, I also consider this event: Suppose the (majority of) MKR holders become greedy, for whatever reason, and decide to print unbacked DAI, or to onboard a ridiculous amount of very risky assets. At the current ES level (50k), a responsible MKR whale might not be able fight this vote (because they have only 5% of the MKR) but they are able to trigger a ES protecting the DAI holders.  \u2192 NOTE: We voted, around October, for a \u2018declaration of intent\u2019 saying that we are ready to burn the MKR of anybody triggering the ES for reasons that are considered not adequate. So, in the above Example, the whale might accept to see their 50k MKR evaporate to save the DAI holders (maybe themselves) from risk. ",

                    "content": "Hey folx, I wanted to weigh in with some thoughts from the @Risk-Core-Unit side. Also worth mentioning that emergency shutdown mechanism is interrelated with technical, oracle, and governance matters. Emergency shutdown is both a source of risk to the protocol and a key risk mitigation mechanism, so any changes need to be carefully balanced.  Context Emergency shutdown can become necessary in response to auction issues, critical technical faults, oracle issues, or governance attacks (among other things). The response timelines needed and alternative options vary based on the circumstance:  For critical oracle faults where a bad OSM price was queued, MKR holders would need to muster a response within 1 hour. If it was not possible to sufficiently mitigate losses via other means (e.g. by deactivating liquidations on affected collaterals), holders would need to trigger shutdown. For technical issues, it may be possible to organize a fix via the Dark Spell Mechanism. If it was not possible to issue a fix safely, or if the system was being actively exploited or drained, it would be necessary to trigger emergency shutdown to limit damage. For governance attacks, MKR holders could first attempt to pass a further vote to cancel the malicious pending executive. This requires surpassing the MKR balance on the current executive within the governance delay period (currently 2 days). If it\u2019s not possible to meet this higher token threshold, MKR holders would need to trigger emergency shutdown. For auction issues, MKR holders may be able to avoid losses by deactivating liquidations (which is not behind the GSM delay). If this does not sufficiently mitigate the issue, it would be necessary to pass an executive and wait for the GSM delay, or trigger shutdown.  If emergency shutdown was triggered in a case where it was not necessary, this would cause substantial disruption to Maker and the wider defi ecosystem. DAI would cease to function as a stablecoin, instead tracking its underlying basket of collateral. While impact on DAI holders would vary depending on market conditions, it seems likely there would be a rush to dispose of unstable collateral in exchange for an alternative stablecoin, likely leading to losses at least in the short term. Integrated lending or derivatives products collateralized in DAI would also become unstable. While this would be extremely problematic, an alternative case where emergency shutdown was unable to be triggered when necessary would be even more disastrous. In a worst case scenario, all system collateral could be lost which would result in total losses for both vault owners and DAI holders.     g_dip:  if the system is (in aggregate) 250% over-collateralized, I would not consider triggering ES unless 60% of the collateral was at risk or Dai was able to be inflated enough to drag the aggregate collateralization below 100%.   DAI holders don\u2019t necessarily benefit from the aggregate system collateral levels, as vault owners are able to receive excess collateral first before DAI holders can redeem during emergency shutdown. It\u2019s possible for DAI to become underfunded well before system collateralization reaches 100%.     Aaron_Bartsch:  I just want to reiterate that the consequence of increasing the ES minimum is that we will probably have to increase the GSM to more than 48 hours. It should also be done in tandem with this parameter change. Hope to hear from mandated actors what an acceptable change would look like (96 hours? More?) This might create some new tail risks.   While mitigating governance attacks are one important use case for emergency shutdown, the window of opportunity for triggering ES is relatively long. Increasing the GSM delay could impede responses to oracle, auction, or technical issues, in addition to slowing down non emergency governance action.  Malicious Shutdown Threat To trigger emergency shutdown, users must burn their MKR tokens. In most cases this would impose a substantial financial cost upon an attacker, but there may be certain hedging mechanisms available that would make the process less costly. For example, an attacker could borrow tokens from Aave v1 or v2 and use them to trigger shutdown, on the assumption that they\u2019d be able to repurchase at low prices in the ensuing market turmoil. It may also be possible to open short positions via futures or perpetual contracts to offset the cost of the MKR tokens burned.These strategies assume MKR tokens would substantially fall in value during an emergency shutdown attack. Certain competing protocols or hostile organizations may also have a vested interest in MakerDAO\u2019s failure, with financial stakes that outweigh the cost of acquiring and burning 50,000 MKR.  Next steps We can help mitigate risk of emergency shutdown through a holistic approach to operational readiness and governance security. First, we should adopt and implement a protocol continuity plan. Continuity planning is a standard practice (often required by regulators) for mission critical businesses like financial institutions. Testing response plans for various emergencies will give us a better idea of the appropriate token requirement for triggering shutdown and minimum response times required to take action. We can also engage with parties offering short interest on MKR to see if we can encourage them to curtail these products. Without borrowing or derivatives liquidity, it will be much more difficult for potential attackers to avoid the financial cost of triggering emergency shutdown. Aave is a primary source of MKR borrowing liquidity and would be a good target for DAO engagement. MKR is also listed on several centralized derivatives and lending venues, which may be more difficult to curtail. Offering additional utility for keeping MKR tokens within the Maker system is another strategy to help mitigate the issue. The governance rewards mechanism would make holding long MKR positions through derivatives or lending platforms less competitive, which would increase the cost of financing short positions. Offering MKR holders an opportunity to borrow through the Maker may also incentivize users against supplying assets to external platforms. Finally, a continuous monitoring program for MKR tokens could help MakerDAO understand governance risk conditions and set relevant parameters. This could include review of MKR liquidity and availability on spot, lending, and derivatives platforms, as well as ownership changes and concentration. With respect to the emergency shutdown threshold, I propose an increase to 75,000 MKR. This is comfortably above the MKR liquidity on Aave v2 (35,000), Aave v1 (7,000), and reported open interest on perpetual swaps on Binance and FTX (roughly 5,000), which helps reduce attack risk. On the other hand the threshold would remain low enough to be confident in voters\u2019 ability to respond in an emergency - MKR holders were able to activate nearly 75,000 votes within a few hours to pass last week\u2019s executive vote.
