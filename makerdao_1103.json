By demonstrating the value of crypto and blockchain to the next generation of global business leaders, we hope to promote and increase the integration of blockchain and crypto technology across all sectors of business in the global economy.  Leverage the entrepreneurial talent at LBS for the evolution of the Maker Protocol Educate our peers on the blockchain technology and exciting projects in the ecosystem such as Maker Provide hands on learning experiences, through our own DAO as well as participating as delegates in others Strategic mindset with a global focus  Delegate Statement Brief Introduction: The LBS Blockchain society is a student and professional society at the London Business School, set up to empower the LBS community with all opportunities of the fast growing crypto / Web3 industry through education, workshops and networking events. The LBS Blockchain Society is the fastest growing and most active society in the LBS community despite being the youngest, having gained over 600 LBS telegram members in the last 8 months and averaging one large event per month. More recently we have put together our first ever annual Blockchain event, hosting 250+ students across 8 events with 20 speakers and panellists. What you believe in as a delegate:  Bringing the Entrepreneurial Perspective to the Maker Protocol: London Business School entrepreneurs have raised $4B of funding in 2021\u2013 through a combination of the location, openness to entrepreneurship, emphasis on teamwork, open access to co-founders, advisors, and investors, and limitless showcasing opportunities, LBS has been able to create over 560 companies so far.  Need for decentralisation: The London Blockchain Society has been carefully trying to educate LBS students and beyond about the merits of decentralisation. We cover everything from Blockchain 101 workshops to more specific market research such as the DAO tooling landscape. We are also currently in the process of organising hackathons to encourage blockchain development. Growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem: We are looking forward to fostering the development of blockchain based initiatives and businesses that are built in partnership with MakerDAO. The LBS Blockchain Society understands the importance of connecting the crypto ecosystem to Real World Assets to improve the overall stability of the ecosystem. We as a group have a strong understanding of what constitutes strong yield-generating real-world assets \u2013 and have experience across industries ranging from the more prominent RWAs such as real estate to more specific ones such as supply-chain financing (tokenised income streams for YouTube creators) and even carbon-credits.  Why MKR Holders should delegate to you: LBS is home to the global leaders of tomorrow. Consistently ranking among the top 5 business schools globally, LBS students come from and place in top firms around the world. LBS students are experts in subject matters ranging from financial markets to artificial intelligence and organisational theory. Given the diversity of cultural and professional backgrounds amongst the student cohort, LBS students are extremely entrepreneurial by nature. As mentioned above, 560 companies have been founded by LBS alumni, including unicorns such as HelloFresh, Feedzai, Wayflyer, Lonely Planet, and many more. We actively support MakerDAO\u2019s ambition to fund projects that make positive and tangible changes in the world today- particularly projects that may be on a smaller scale, but that could have an outsized impact if scaled. We believe in creating a better, more sustainable, more equal world for our global society, and are dedicated to using our skillsets to make this happen. The current Research Team leadership has experience across portfolio management at JP Morgan, research at the Reserve Bank of Australia and research at Europe\u2019s most prominent Web3 VC Fabric Ventures. This unique mix of backgrounds, as well as the diverse backgrounds of our peers, will help LBS Blockchain in making diligent voting decisions regarding the protocols future. Before each vote, the research team will present a summary of the ongoing discussion to the executive committee and members of the society, and together we will vote on the final LBS Blockchain decision. Given that LBS is a graduate school, most of us already have 5-10 years of professional work experience at large, global organisations and institutions, we believe that being a delegator will allow us to help the MakerDAO community identify the right projects to fund. Using our global network, our understanding of business models, and our entrepreneurial mindset, we believe we are in a unique position to help source and evaluate these types of projects. In fact, the LBS motto is even, \u201cTo have a profound impact on the way the world does business\u201d. At a higher level, as a Blockchain Society, we will aim to connect the industry to talent, working as a facilitator in both the professional development of our students and tapping in to available Web3 talent at LBS and our extended networks. This will enable the next generation of crypto and blockchain focused businesses to have a profound impact on financial systems, supply chains, computational systems and art, just to name a few. There is a clear synergy here between the organisational needs of Maker and the funnel of talent which our society can leverage. Given all these factors, we believe that the LBS Blockchain Society would be an ideal candidate for the MakerDAO delegate program. Conflicts of Interest The LBS Blockchain Society currently does not have any material conflicts of interest. As a society we do not hold any other cryptocurrencies nor do we currently take in membership fees. We agree to keep the MakerDAO society updated should any conflicts of interest arise. We have read and agree to the Delegate Code of Conduct 2, and agree to carefully abide by all the points entailed. Waiver of liability By delegating to LBS Blockchain, you acknowledge and agree that LBS Blockchain will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.

                    "content": "Community Greenlight Poll - bIBTA (Backed Finance Short-Term Bond ETF) - July 18, 2022 We are voting YES in favour of this proposal:   We understand that MIP6 and MIP65 in combination represent important initiatives to monetise MakerDAO\u2019s asset base and generate yield for its holders.   Backed Finance appears to be a reputable partner for bridging on-chain assets to off-chain securities. Its choice of jurisdiction, legal makeup and operating structure suggest that it has taken a considered approach to tokenising IBTA securities and is acting in its best ability to comply with relevant legislation.   The bond instrument to be tokenised is consistent, in terms of duration, risk profile and currency of denomination, with that prescribed by the original MIP13c3-SP12 proposal.   However, we have a number of concerns that we believe warrant further discussion and / or consideration of alternatives by domain teams:   The issuance and redemption of bIBTA is controlled by a single party, Backed Finance, which aggregates counterparty and other operational risks for MakerDAO.   The mechanics behind the oracle design are unclear at this stage. It has been suggested that the oracle will be deployed by Maker only, but prior concerns regarding oracle design and the robustness of price feeds have not been sufficiently addressed in our view.   MakerDAO is exposing itself to non-trivial legal and regulatory risks should it be deemed to be facilitating the trading of bIBTA tokens by non-approved investors (e.g. US market participants). We have not seen a legal opinion that dispels these concerns - as per past posts Maker deems these comments to be private.   It is unclear why bIBTA cannot be implemented as a regular MKR vault but instead needs to be run through a modified PSM design. This is again prone to centralisation and is less resistant to attack / other operational risks.   In consideration of the above, we are voting in favour of this proposal to give it the chance to pass on to domain teams for further assessment. However, this is in view of the community greenlight only and from our perspective there are a number of questions that need to be resolved before we would be happy with this implementation in practice.

StarkWare is a deeply experienced, well-funded, and widely recognised team within crypto spheres. We believe their reputation provides sufficient safeguards against the centralisation risk posed by provers and sequencers on StarkNet. Our primary concern is regarding the robustness of the L1 <> L2 bridge which will be implemented via an oracle mechanism. Although we understand this has gone through extensive testing, the complexity of the mechanism (and in particular its reliance on an oracle) opens it up to attack vectors that may not be properly anticipated. While the low debt ceiling provides interim safeguards in this respect, the associated risks will need to be carefully monitored as the platform scales. For purpose of the community poll, and given the precedent set by Arbitrum and Optimism, we consider the initial risk parameters to be appropriate and support the implementation of the proposal at this stage.

The requested operating costs seem high to us, and we are unsure whether a board of 7 is needed to manage these assets. Most importantly, it seems problematic to be allocating funds based on events that have not yet materialised (especially where the likelihood of those events has not been established). Going with the principle of allocating funds only once legal liabilities have materialised or have a reasonable chance of materialising, we would suggest removing the contingency buffer and bringing operating costs down to a more reasonable level (say -10% in line with wider cuts across Maker). This gets us to an opex estimate landing somewhere between the \u2018bear\u2019 and \u2018super bear\u2019 case. Conservatively, we are voting for the \u2018bear\u2019 case as a 1st choice and \u2018super bear\u2019 as a 2nd choice. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 Vote: Approve Against the backdrop of Maker\u2019s softening financial performance, we consider it sensible to define a more streamlined process for offboarding CUs. Having reviewed the new language of this proposal, we believe the proposed changes are an improvement on the prior documentation and should be implemented. Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 Vote: Yes We understand that the Oracle CU is proposing a 10% budget reduction with the inclusion of a clause that no further cuts be made to the OCU budget. We consider that the Oracle CU is a central and growing part of the Maker protocol, particularly in light of upcoming L2 expansion plans and increasing reliance of Maker on decentralised oracles to bring prices on-chain and monitor the flow of assets across networks. We believe that sufficient budget should be allocated to this CU to support the expansion in scope of its activities, however we do not believe it is prudent to lock in an exemption for budget cuts before that has been decided at the protocol level. For this reason, we vote for approving the existing budget (business as usual) with scope for implementing future budget cuts once decided across all CUs. Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 Vote: Yes D3M has proven to be successful and helped Maker to establish its role as a \u2018Layer 0\u2019 wholesale provider of liquidity, while generating a new revenue stream for the protocol. We understand that the proposed amendment rewrites the original proposal (MIP50) to expand its scope toward all external protocols that require liquidity (not just lending protocols such as Aave). This revision is uncontroversial in our view and we look forward to monitoring the continued success of D3M. Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 Vote: Abstain We understand that this proposal is a reprise of MIP55c3-SP4, a rejected proposal submitted back in April 2022 for the incorporation of a $10M Special Purpose Fund (SPF) called Makershire Hathaway. This renewed proposal narrows down the strategies and limits them to stablecoin lending in permitted currencies / protocols only. Makershire Redux is a low risk way of monetising our asset base and generating new revenues for the protocol. Moreover, the reprised proposal addresses key concerns of the previously rejected proposal and limiting the fund to stablecoin LPing reduces the scope for impermance loss, depeg and other risks. Arbitrum and Optimism are already part of the rollout strategy of Dai making them a good fit for network support. Counterweighing this, the fund would be subject to the usual technical and smart contract risks, particularly where deployed to L2 protocols that are less well tested and may be subject to validator / sequencer downtime. However, our greater concern is with the strategic alignment of this initiative with Maker\u2019s wider strategy - in particular, the question of whether it should be acting as an \u2018onchain hedge fund\u2019 with the objective of monetising its asset base through lending, or whether it should focus on being a decentralised stablecoin. As we have not figured out our position on this internally, we are voting to Abstain. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 Vote: No We do not support the proposal to unwind the Events CU. Although the budget allocation of 800k seems high, having a presence at global blockchain events is a crucial marketing pillar for both the Maker and DAI brands. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the Events CU will provide useful outputs given it was only established 2 months ago. We propose reducing the budget rather than offboarding it, which would set the wrong precedent. ",

It seeks to draw down 150MM DAI and will collateralise this with senior debt positions from within Blocktowers fund. Given Blocktowers extensive engagement with the Maker community dating back to 2019, and being a fervent believer in the Maker ecosystem itself, we support this proposal. Further we recognise that Centrifuge, another longstanding partner of the MakerDAO, is ideal for carrying out these activities. Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) - August 15, 2022 The proposal seeks to draw down 12MM of DAI against a mining machine collateral which Cabot values at 15MM USD (80% LTV). Based on the evidence provided we are not convinced such machines could be liquidated at the valuation provided by Cabot. Further since the proposal rests on a handful of other assumptions, that carry with it a far larger risk than we believe Maker to be suited for, we opt to defer this proposal. Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 The proposal seeks to green light a credit facility that would allow the company Detox Medical Facilities, which manages addiction rehabilitation centres across the US, to draw down 70MM DAI. We vote to defer this proposal as there is by and large a conflation of the value of operations of a detox facility and the value of a real estate asset, which is to be used as collateral. If DMF were to go bankrupt, the question whether Maker can realise the full value that it ascribes to the real estate, if the operating firm of the facility is not able to provide its service. The loan thus involves a significant component of business risk which is not represented in the proposed 6% interest rate. Given the lack of historical records of DMF / DDC, this proposal would expose Maker to a significant amount of counter party risk. ",

The changes in wording help to clarify legal detail where previously missing, and the changes seem generally uncontentious to us. Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) \u2013 September 5, 2022 The legal and governance structure of the RWA vault is critical to its proper functioning, and should be approved by an appointed board of qualified members. The proposed wording change lowers the bar for approving proposed legal structures, and makes use of vague wording such as \u201clegal credentials\u201d without specifying the nature of those credentials. We understand that this amendment has been specifically directed toward @christiancdpetersen to carry out the legal work however the changes are too broad in scope to be accepted. Recommend a redraft with tighter language. MIP55c3-SP8: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund The proposal requests a 30k DAI reimbursement to SF-001 for advancing legal expenses to @christiancdpetersen relating to legal work in the context of MIP65, which was previously approved by the community. The deliverable of the legal work will be a Legal Structure and Governance Appropriateness Verification to be ratified by a Facilitator according to MIP65. Since the legal work is a part of the MIP65 scope, proceeding in its development is coherent with what has been decided by the community so far, so we will support this proposal. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 In order to attract top tier talent, the DAO should adequately compensate its members for their contributions. This is in the spirit of the agreement between Maker contributors. That being said, the vesting schedule is also a legal agreement between contributors to Maker. Voting in an exception to the rule sets the wrong precedent. We are abstaining from this proposal and would recommend finding a middle ground through a subsequent proposal - some examples others have already suggested include: (1) @eumenes and @teej to continue working for Maker through another CU so that the vesting schedule can mature and funds then released at the 1 year mark; or (2) the pro rata shares be released by only at the 1-year mark once the funds are fully vested.

                    "content": "Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight) Reasoning: Gnosis is a well-regarded protocol within the Ethereum / DeFi ecosystem with a widely used product (Gnosis safe) and chain providing DAO tooling and other services to protocols in the DAO ecosystem where DAI is the native currency. Gnosis itself is highly decentralised and GNO is a decentralised, non-custodial asset, which makes it attractive as a new deposit type. That said, the primary use case for Gnosis is still Gnosis safe, and tGNO is likely to remain relatively illiquid ($0.8M 24H volume), which introduces risks for Maker in the event of liquidation. Maker is effectively providing lending to Gnosis secured on its illiquid DAO token - Gnosis is currently trading at $340M market cap and a $30M issuance would be 10% of its liquid market cap. On balance, given the wider synergies and opportunities for collaboration with Gnosis and its ecosystem, we see this deal as being value accretive to Maker. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: Both of these are already onboarded collateral types, so no additional liquidity risk as Maker is already exposed. The only incremental risk is increasing the weighting towards one or the other of the underlying assets which would bring it above the debt ceiling. Debt ceiling for renBTC currently is $10M, but proposed debt ceiling for LP token is $50M, and the TVL for wBTC is an order of magnitude higher than renBTC meaning it is likely that the pool will be more heavily weighted toward renBTC, bringing it above the debt ceiling. Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight) Reasoning: We are voting to greenlight this proposal, as we want to encourage a diversification of the centralised stablecoin collateral backing DAI. However, we do want to emphasise that we would prefer DAI to become less reliant on centralised stablecoin collateral. BUSD is the third largest stablecoin behind both USDT and USDC with significant liquidity and Arrakis (Gelato) is a proven partner to the MakerDAO with its DAI-USDC vaults. ",

Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The MIP77 provides a detailed approach and structure for the complete RDs\u2019 lifecycle in the protocol. Given the current uncertainty the protocol is going through, and the growing importance of  RDs\u2019 role in its future development, it is important to set clear definitions for RDs\u2019 role and their evaluation. In addition, these definitions paired with a correct compensation structure (established in MIP78 & MIP79) will underpin the attraction and retention of talent to participate in the protocol\u2019s governance. We hope this approval will trigger a more detailed development of the proposal in such proposal components as: Participation Metric: Having a clear framework for providing reasoning/emergency proofs when abstaining from Executives Votes and intending to avoid affecting the Participation Metric. Communication Metric: Being more specific about how the Governance Facilitators will assess/decide if the RD\u2019s voting reasoning is sufficient. Metric Tracking:  Making the UI more clear in how it show the RDs\u2019 metric, ie. There is no breakdown of the calculation. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: In line with prior voting the group believes that Starknet development in partnership with MakerDAO is important and thus funding should be provided to ensure that the partnership can continue utilizing the best possible people. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Clearly evidenced growing interest / organic engagement by LatAm community with MakerDAO, establishing a need for this working unit and funding Amount allocated is relatively small but appears will go a long way toward furthering the efforts already committed by this group Important to champion grassroots efforts to expand the MakerDAO community. Its responsibilities however could also be included within the Strategic Happiness CU. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: 100% multiplier (165.14 total MKR) Reasoning: Equity compensation for employees at most companies is typically less than 100% of their base salary (in many cases much less). The equity is also often subject to much longer vesting periods than one year, and will be forfeited in the event the employee leaves the company. In this context the proposed MKR shares are more valuable. In our view a >100% token payout is high and 200% is very high. We consider a <100% token payout may be sensible and the menu of options presented skews toward a higher than expected token payout. However, the key issue here is perhaps not the specific numbers - but instead the method by which salaries and compensation are determined. Specifically, we think that the salary mix (as between DAI and MKR) should have been decided beforehand and rough KPIs defined (e.g. if X is achieved then that results in an additional payout of Y), with the results settled retroactively. It makes little sense to us that delegates are required to retroactively vote on the salaries (and mix) of each CU individually, and on a 6m cadence. Most delegates will not have had the full context they need to properly evaluate the performance of each CU, and decisions will inevitably be based on incomplete information and (more importantly) shaped by the way the menu of options are presented. We are conservatively voting for a 100% bonus (although we note even this could be considered high). In future we would suggest that compensation is decided across all CUs in advance. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Give the CU more time and support it with constructive suggestions on how to maximise the use of the 65k budget. Revisit this CU, budget and responsibilities in a year again to fairly measure value and progress of the CU. ",

End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: While ending funding for SourceCred will no doubt save the CU money and time and have other potential upsides, it does limit the opportunity for more widespread participation in MakerDAO and centralises voices / decision-making in the community.

MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We see a clear rationale for updating the calculation of the target borrow rate. Previously, the additional parameters were added to try and offset one another but makes more sense to remove them altogether to avoid further proposals to bring the target rate back in line with market reality. MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted:  Option 1 - 0.5% Option 2 - 0% Reasoning: The bar was previously set at negative in the context of much higher interest rates. This no longer makes sense in context of the current rate environment (particularly if the other proposal passes). Having a small positive minimum spread of 0.5% allows Maker to retain some flexibility in setting the target rate, but allows Maker vaults to remain competitive against Aave. This is the most sensible option. We can support a second option of 0% spread - this would give us more flexibility to deploy capital. ",

However at this stage it seems premature given: (a) the Endgame Plan has not yet been passed, (b) the MetaDAO clusters have not yet been formalised, and (c) it is unclear which MetaDAO the Events CU would be restructured under. The unwinding expenses on the CU also seem very high to us, and it is difficult in our view to justify such a large golden parachute payment to a CU incorporated only in March, especially given it is intended to be reemployed under a MetaDAO. We are voting No in favour of deferring this vote to after the Endgame Plan has passed, when hopefully there will be greater clarity around reemployment of Events CU contributors. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We believe in fairly compensating outgoing facilitators, and should the Endgame Plan be passed, it makes sense to offboard this Core Unit and integrate it into one of the new MetaDAO clusters. However at this stage it seems premature given: (a) the Endgame Plan has not yet been passed, (b) the MetaDAO clusters have not yet been formalised, and (c) it is unclear which MetaDAO the RWF CU would be restructured under. The unwinding expenses on the CU also seem very high to us, and it is difficult in our view to justify such a large golden parachute payment (in addition to release of all unvested Maker tokens), especially if this CU is intended to be reemployed under a MetaDAO. We are voting No in favour of deferring this vote to after the Endgame Plan has passed, when hopefully there will be greater clarity around reemployment of CU contributors. Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We need to better utilise our balance sheet and the 1.5% yield is an attractive way to bring immediate income to Maker. That said, this proposal is likely to create lock-in to holding USDC because of the revenue stream it creates, which runs contrary to the intention to decentralise our stablecoin holdings. We need to actively source other revenue opportunities to relieve this exposure. There are also operational and centralisation risks given a small handful of community members will hold access to the funds. This part needs to be better implemented. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Along with MIP81, this will allow us to better utilise our balance sheet and generate immediate yield / income for Maker. It will also reduce our short-term exposure to USDC. Coinbase is a reputable partner and the loan remains highly liquid, however it is unclear at this stage what the use of funds will be for Coinbase and therefore it is difficult to assess the risk of lending here. We recommend approving the proposal but clarifying this with Coinbase. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Approving this proposal to release a required cost for onboarding BlockTower Credit, as per previously greenlit poll. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We agree with the rationale that a facilitator not fulfilling his or her mandate over a prolonged period of time is best off boarded quickly. The current duration of the process leaves room for uncertainty. Increasing the minimum allowed times  offers more flexibility. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Given the controversy surrounding the leadership and conduct of the RWF-001 CU, it makes sense to formally offboard this individual.

                    "content": "We are voting NO to the Endgame Plan Prelaunch MIP Set and set out our rationale below. Our response focuses on a critique of the Endgame Plan rather than its implementation details as set out in the sub-proposals to this MIP set. Summary and context We understand that the Endgame Plan proposed by Rune is a roadmap for Maker to achieve maximal growth and decentralisation over the next 10+ years of its operation and bundles together a number of interrelated components, some of which we consider are separable from the whole. Therefore, in reviewing the Endgame Plan we not only critique the proposal as a whole, but also review the merits of certain such components. We understand that the Endgame Plan, once passed, intends to:   Reorganise Maker\u2019s workforce into self-sustainable MetaDAOs that would be synergistic with Maker Core, but will run on their own profitable business models, issue their own governance tokens, and operate parallel decentralised governance processes.   Overall simplify Maker Core and its governance, and address the problem of voter apathy by simplifying Maker\u2019s operations (ditto for each MetaDAO), thereby allowing delegates to develop greater functional specialism across MetaDAOs.   Allow Maker to compartmentalise risk and pursue riskier activities such as real world lending without it directly affecting the P&L of core Maker.   Use the opportunity to restructure the organisation and make operations more efficient, including by reorganising MetaDAOs between 6 initial MetaDAOs split between three classes: Governors (which will house existing Maker CUs), Creators (developers and engineering) and Protectors (for RWA teams).   Use tokenomics / metanomics to incentivise participation in Dai and MetaDAO governance; distribute MetaDAO tokens through yield farming for maximal decentralisation.   Define 11 scopes (focus areas) for Maker Governance to outline the parameters of its decision-making, including broadly: decentralised collateral, RWA collateral, protocol engineering, growth / marketing, finance, stability and liquidity (on-chain levers), legal, infrastructure, interface / frontends, ecosystem, governance.   Launch EtherDai as a sort of \u2018pure\u2019 Dai backed by liquid staked ETH, recognising that Ether is the most decentralised and secure form of collateral for Maker.   Establish a roadmap to decentralising Maker\u2019s collateral portfolio comprising a sequential series of three stances (each representing tradeoffs between resilience and growth / profitability):  Pigeon Stance (for the first 2.5 years): which imposes no limit to RWA exposure with Dai pegged 1:1 with USD, with the expectation that any regulatory threat remains low Eagle Stance (after 2.5 years): Dai becomes free floating with negative Target Rate, potentially significantly reducing demand for it Phoenix Stance: the ultimate stance for Maker where no RWA is allowed, to ensure maximal protection against regulatory crackdown    As per 8a above, eventually allow Dai to free float away from USD and change its price over time in accordance with the Target Rate (a new lever that would be peer to DSR and Stability Fee) to avoid regulation associated with RWA activities (e.g. confiscation of collateral)   Launch a protocol owned vault (POVE) owned by Maker Governance with the purpose of acquiring ETHD and other decentralised assets as collateral, and using it to generate Dai. The vault will be under-collateralised but cannot be liquidated.   Motivating issues The proposals above must be placed in context of the underlying problems that motivated them. We understand these to be broadly split between 4 key issues:   Lack of consensus over Maker\u2019s overriding objective / purpose: the debate / gridlock around Maker\u2019s RWA strategy over the past few months has been unproductive from a monetisation standpoint, but has sparked critical discussion around what Maker\u2019s core purpose should be. Indeed, it is this lack of consensus that is causing many of the problems with Maker.  Lack of consensus over RWA strategy: related to the above, a core area of disagreement between Maker token holders is whether Maker should focus on delivering on its mission as a decentralised, permissionless stablecoin, or whether it should function as a sort of on-chain bank that allocates capital between crypto and real world assets.  Voter apathy and delegate overload: like most other DAOs, Maker is subject to voter apathy, and while this is partly mitigated by delegate compensation, the sheer volume and complexity of proposals means that delegates often don\u2019t have the bandwidth to develop functional expertise and properly debate the issues. Moreover, the current compensation structure optimises for participation rate rather than decision quality.  Operational overhead and low profitability: the organisation sprawl of Maker, with over 100+ employees and numerous Core Units and functions, is creating significant complexity which accrues real costs for the organisation. This is particularly important against the backdrop of Maker\u2019s declining profitability.  Our response 1/ The first motivating issue above is the overriding issue of what Maker\u2019s purpose ought to be. Our view is that discussion of this core issue should precede discussion of all others. On this point, we believe that the Endgame Plan introduces new and complex governance features that, put simply, don\u2019t solve for the core problem at hand. While outsourcing activities to MetaDAOs may be a way to move past the gridlock today, it doesn\u2019t truly isolate Maker from those activities, either financially or politically. This is because Maker continues to have ownership in and partial control over the MetaDAOs, and they continue to be (implicitly) aligned with the mission and profitability of the parent org. In this sense, they are not truly separable, nor can they be thought of as isolated experiments from the core org itself. For example, a RWA MetaDAO that uses Dai for risky real world lending introduces systematic risks that affect the entire ecosystem, irrespective of whether that lending activity sits within Maker or a seperate MetaDAO. Further, if the agreed constitution of Maker prevents it from such lending, is it truly insulated even if the MetaDAO sat within its own org and issued its own token? The incentives, structures, and relationships sitting behind those dollars exist, regardless of what governance features are layered on top. To address this first problem, we would instead welcome the creation of a Constitution similar to that proposed by Hasu and mentioned as part of subproposal MIP1c4-SP1. This is the most direct solution to aligning the objectives of MakerDAO token holders, and can be implemented as an MIP to resolve further disputes over the issue. Importantly, we believe this can be implemented without a system of MetaDAOs (although if the protocol is split into minimal, separable components, we do believe they can and should work together toward a common goal). 2/ The second motivating issue above is closely related to, and follows on from, the first. While Maker\u2019s RWA strategy should ultimately be decided by a vote amongst MKR token holders (likely as part of its Constitution), our view on this issue is as follows: RWAs introduce centralisation, counterparty and other risks to Maker, which move it away from the original vision of creating a permissionless, decentralised stablecoin (NOT a crypto bank). Reasserting the original intention of Maker here is important we think, and the protocol should have a very low tolerance for centralised points of failure that may threaten its collateral base and existence (we have plenty of counterexamples recently from Celsius, 3ac etc regarding the dangers of this). It appears to us that the intention to allow Dai to depeg from USD over the medium term is motivated by the fear of regulatory risk that RWA activity would invite. The roadmap to ultimate decentralise (from Pigeon to Phoenix stance) envisions eventually phasing out RWA, with Dai depegging from the USD in the interim to limit our exposure to RWA activities. But is this tradeoff really worth it? The core product of Maker today is Dai, the leading decentralised permissionless stablecoin in crypto, which would suggest that price stability (above all else) should be the core objective of Maker. Allowing a float away from $1 as a cost to implementing a RWA strategy seems like a bizarre tradeoff \u2013 the loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from such a depeg would be far more detrimental to the long-term resilience of Maker than any profit opportunities foregone in the short term. If so, then why not just abandon RWA in the first place and restrict Dai to on-chain collateral? The risk and complexity associated with the path laid out in the Endgame Plan is just not worth it, in our view. 3/ The third motivating issue above deals with voter apathy and delegate overload, which are clearly serious issues for Maker. As delegates ourselves, we would welcome the opportunity to engage in higher quality debate and focus on issues where we can really add value. That being said, it is not fully clear to us how MetaDAOs can help with addressing this problem. Our understanding is that each MetaDAO would have its own set of delegates and be in charge of its own \u201cparallelised\u201d governance processes. On this point, Rune draws an analogy between MetaDAOs and L2 rollups that leverage the security of their L1s (being MakerDAO in this case). But how do Governance L2s \u201croll up\u201d to MakerDAO Governance? If this is achieved by MakerDAO holding the tokens of its MetaDAOs, then doesn\u2019t this introduce the same problems of complexity for MKR token holders? In particular, MKR holders would be required to vote their shares in each of the MetaDAOs, creating even more complexity and putting us back in the same position we started in. The objective of delegates in the context of decentralised organisations should be to make good decisions that preserve and increase the long term value of the token they hold. Given the value of MKR is economically tied to the value of MetaDAO tokens by way of metanomics, this does not isolate MKR governors from being involved with MetaDAO governance. In this respect, the implementation of MetaDAOs increases the management overhead, rather than reducing it. 4/ The final motivating issue deals with Maker\u2019s organisational sprawl and a desire to restructure and streamline its activities. This is clearly a growing concern, but as pointed out by Porter from a16z, the accountability and efficiency of CUs can be readily improved by altering their internal processes and procedures. Conversely, it\u2019s not clear to us how MetaDAO moves the needle forward in terms of making Maker easier to manage. Rune makes reference to Alphabet as a sort of blueprint for understanding the purpose of a MetaDAO structure - but we don\u2019t agree. Within Alphabet\u2019s org structure, \u2018Bets\u2019 are self-contained organisations with their own strategic purpose and P&L, whereas in our case, activities like RWA that would sit within their own MetaDAO are nonetheless core to Maker and inseparable from its activities. Moreover, the Alphabet reorganisation happened at a stage where Google was already relatively mature. MakerDAO is still a young business, and introducing new complexity here will only serve to increase management burden and overhead, both for delegates and other stakeholders. More importantly, from a value and growth standpoint, splitting MetaDAOs into their own P&L / intermeshed token ecosystems is only value accretive if those MetaDAOs can generate more value than they currently do as CUs under Maker. That will only happen for one of two reasons, either: (1) if they are able to better pursue market opportunities, resulting in higher aggregate revenues; or (2) if they are able to run more efficiently, resulting in lower operating costs. Point (1) above is achieved by clearly establishing Maker\u2019s purpose, identifying the market opportunities available within those parameters, and deploying resources to go after those opportunities. Point (2) is achieved by implementing better operational processes that reduce overhead and cost. In other words, tokenomics isn\u2019t the solution to everything. Layering on new and complex token economies does not create value if the underlying activities don\u2019t change. Conversely, increasing the management burden and fragmenting liquidity between different MDAO governance tokens will very likely destroy value. We welcome comments and feedback on these points, but based on the rationale we have set out, we are presently choosing to vote against the Endgame Plan. We may choose to revise this position should the Endgame Plan be amended. ",

                    "content": "We think there may be a middle ground between these extremes. Would agree that the peg is easiest to maintain with 100% RWA and that difficulty rises as you move toward greater % on-chain collateral. But there are other levers here that can help with managing a volatile collateral base, e.g reducing the required collateralisation ratio, reducing the stability fee (setting negative interest rates) etc. Having a Dai asset backed purely by on-chain collateral (Eth) was the original design of Maker (Single Collateral Dai) and is also the intention behind EtherDai presumably. But of course it doesn\u2019t have to be 100% on-chain collateral, it could be some level lower than the current 70% - perhaps 30%, 20%? The idea is to reduce exposure to RWA to an acceptable level commensurate with its perceived regulatory / existential risk, but which still allows for the price peg to be reasonably maintained (via the levers above). This requires more active management + trading off some capital efficiency, but that is a fair price to pay for price predictability and regulatory resilience. I guess a decentralised stablecoin can never be truly pegged 1:1 to a dollar but if we continue to have most of our collateral in USDC then it\u2019s hard to call it decentralised. A diversified collateral portfolio with ETH, USDC, other stablecoins, on-chain assets and RWA seems like the way to go in striking a balance. Basically we shouldn\u2019t completely discard price stability to pursue RWA, nor should we fully centralise in exchange for 1:1 price stability. ",

Another advantage of USDC collateral or any other stablecoin PSM is that it allows Maker to reinvest a portion of these funds in USD denominated T-Bills or other USD denominated short term investments without substantial asset pricing risk considerations. I am in favor of collateral diversification (reduce USDC reliance) and a close 1 to 1 USD peg. But also if DAI was backed 90% by on chain volatile assets like ETH and BTC it would be much harder to reinvest any portion of those funds in USD off-chain investments (hoping in the future tokenization brings USD investment onchain). While collateral diversification is important, uncorrelated revenue streams (i.e. investment income via asset deployment and stability fees) are also hugely needed for Maker\u2019s long-term sustainability.

Allowing a float away from $1 as a cost to implementing a RWA strategy seems like a bizarre tradeoff \u2013 the loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from such a depeg would be far more detrimental to the long-term resilience of Maker than any profit opportunities foregone in the short term. If so, then why not just abandon RWA in the first place and restrict Dai to on-chain collateral? The risk and complexity associated with the path laid out in the Endgame Plan is just not worth it, in our view.   Not sure where RWA are a condition to depeg. Quite the opposite, RWA (USDC being one) are needed to keep the peg, that\u2019s why they were introduced in the first place. The depeg will be a consequence of removing RWA as there is not enough $-linked decentralized assets ($-expressed ETH-backed loans) to sustain our current scale of DAI. How to get to 1-trillion DAI without \u201ccentralized\u201d assets is still an unbacked idea. I spent quite some time on it but still unable to figure out the trick. ",

The amount is small relative to its benefit in terms of the perceived health of the ecosystem. It would be better to deal with this issue before it becomes too big. One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: While an enhanced presence for MakerDAO would be good at the ETH Gathering, the extension of the budget after the CU has been offboarded is in bad faith as the event should have been accounted for in the initial budget of the CU. It also requires re-onboarding the CU which introduces logistical challenges with Endgame. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - October 31, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: In the context of declining liquidity within higher risk vaults, it makes sense to increase stability fee and reduce debt ceiling to cap our exposure. We support the launch of Compound D3M to roll out the proven model from Aave. ",

We see this deal as being value accretive to Maker. Rationale: London Business School Delegate Platform - #13 by clmns Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal sets out implementation details for an earlier agreed poll. The size of the facility has increased from $100M to $150M but other headline terms remain substantially the same. We understand that, given how the deal is structured, BlockTower shares in the performance of the portfolio so it is more than just an originator. This incentivises early liquidation of underperforming loans. There is also a first-loss provision meaning BlockTower will bear any losses until such a point when defaults breach both BlockTower\u2019s capital and the originator\u2019s equity position. Of the risk factors outlined in the risk assessment, the one that causes most reason for concern in our view is the oracle responsible for bringing pricing from secondary debt markets (which are limited in transparency to begin with) on-chain. Further, liquidation is triggered manually by BlockTower given this is an actively managed position, which could introduce additional risks. On balance, we see no reason not to move forward with this deal given the successful greenlight poll in August. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: With Alameda filing for bankruptcy and the elevated risk of renBTC depegging, we support offboard renBTC as collateral to minimise risk to the platform. Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Proceed) Reasoning: This deal continues to expand the scope of our relationship with BlockTower Credit in respect of Maker\u2019s RWA activities, further monetising our asset base and diversifying our exposure. The loan instruments in this portfolio are relatively low risk. This is supported by the quoted probability of default figures and other information provided. We support proceeding with the work to conduct due diligence, compliance and other risk analysis for this deal. ",

Alongside this, the previous request was rejected and a new proposal being raised only 7 months after sets a dangerous precedence in the Maker community. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBase Reasoning: DUX CU has important projects in the pipeline and as such it entails that their funding continues up until rollout of endgame plan and subsequent meta-DAO. The rationale behind the NewBase budget is that in the current economic climate there are many talented software engineers that are being made redundant and as such the calibre of engineer available on the market is superior to any other point in time which if hired would only help the DAO. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The PSM currently (18/11/2022) holds in excess of $3bn and only uses $50m to maintain peg stability. The rest of the funds are currently not generating any revenue and also there is high exposure of USDC risk. In line with endgame, Maker can diversify risk by introducing RWA into it\u2019s balance sheet by allowing a full fledged asset management company to manage the portfolio completely. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Voting in favor of this proposal would go against our decision and rationale outlined in MIP40c and MIP41c. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Voting in favor of this proposal would go against our decision and rationale outlined in MIP40c and MIP41c. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget Reasoning: ISCU has continued to provide important security services to Maker by managing its bounty programme. The bug bounty pool constitutes a large and variable cost to Maker, and we consider it difficult to allocate an annual budget in light of this uncertainty. The amount requested is large but apparently does not cover the total potential liability from bounty payouts - this needs to be rethought more comprehensively, to find a more efficient and predictable way of securing the protocol against security vulnerabilities. Further, as an external provider Immunefi may be better placed as an ecosystem service provider under the new reorg, and we would like to see a plan for migrating to this new structure should it be supported by the community. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget Reasoning: GovComms is a core function of Maker Governance and they have made important contributions to the DAO in the past. The revised budget represents cuts in line with the guidance set for the wider organisation, and appears prudent in light of the market environment. Some delegates have suggested rejecting this proposal in favour of encouraging a merger between GovAlpha and GovComms (partly to increase partnership between these two CUs and cut costs). We support this initiative but consider it is important to consider funding this CU while deciding on a roadmap toward such a merger. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget Reasoning: We understand that the management of liquidation and auction mechanisms is an important function, particularly during times of market volatility. However, the proposal is relatively light on new developed features and it\u2019s not particularly clear whether the roadmap justifies the proposed use of funds. The proposed reduction in budget is lower than the guidance set out for Maker as a whole. Further, as an external provider SideStream may be better placed as an ecosystem service provider under the new reorg, and we would like to see a plan for migrating to this new structure should it be supported by the community. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget Reasoning: The proposal has set out that TechOps wishes to concentrate it\u2019s efforts in the new year on infrastructure decentralization, protocol security and monitoring and rolling out increased support across timezones. It will use the budget above to accomplish all of these goals whilst also thinking about the future of MakerDAO in endgame. Therefore it is best for the DAO that the proposal is passed. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: The appropriate analysis, both engineering and risk, have not been conducted to allow this proposal to pass and the implications of this proposal both on and off chain have not been thought through. If this proposal passes the analysis on what happens to investing through the surplus buffer has not been properly quantified and the reasoning behind why 1Bn as the buffer limit has not been given and such we feel it is better to vote against this proposal. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support cooperation with reputable investment firms and diversification in MakerDAO\u2019s assets. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support cooperation with reputable investment firms. Investing on ESG is also a great positioning for Maker\u2019s brand. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve standard option budget Reasoning: SES-001 is on the way to offboarding, so lots of changes in the next few months. The CU members made an outline for their future budget allocation plan but it is coarse grained. It is reasonable to come up with a new plan for the next year, and thus we\u2019ll support for the standard option. ",

                    "content": "DAI Savings Rate Adjustment - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Increase the DSR to 1% Reasoning: The proposal works towards a longer term outlook for Maker of increased revenue generation through savings rate and RWA whilst also aligning Maker with market savings rates and appropriately gives precedence for any further increases during endgame. Endgame proposes a 2% DSR rate with further outlook to increase and so this would be bringing about a precedent that would allow further increases to be made possible. Whilst simulations have not been done to check what the short term and long term impact of revenue and costs associated are, the RWA terms have been agreed and so from a forecasting perspective it is reasonable to assume that the expected revenue generation from this will protect against any short term costs whilst securing Maker against volatile market conditions by increasing the TVL to reduce the surface of attack for market manipulation strategies. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The proposal changes various parameters across Maker\u2019s vaults, PSM and D3M to protect against adverse effects due to the current bearish market sentiment. With FTX and Genesis causing increased volatility and loss of investor confidence in the market the proposed changes intend to reduce risk across platforms by lowering debt ceilings and increasing liquidation auction windows. Overall these changes will allow for more organic activity on the platform while reducing the surface of attack to Maker. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Overall, there are multiple risk protection procedures to secure Maker\u2019s revenue: new legal structure, senior tranche, low-risk market, and insurance vault to circumvent possible transaction failure. Since New Silver is using models to lend, it should be scalable after 2 years development and verification. Increasing capital scale together with stricter risk control measurement is reasonable. ",

Prior to implementation of the Endgame Plan and proper offboarding of this CU, this proposal will give explicit approval for GovComms to continue their work at least for 1 month and likely until the transition has taken place. This does not require further funds to be sent to CU accounts, just requests explicit permissions from delegates. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Prior to implementation of the Endgame Plan and proper offboarding SAS CU, it should be given funds to continue its activities under the existing structure. We understand the funds required to finance operations for the next 3-4 months can be covered by leftover budget allocated from the prior period. However, we would want to understand more precisely what SAS intends to do with this budget over the short period up to restructuring. Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Daimon-Law Reasoning: Both candidates are suitable for the position, but overall we preferred Paul over Jacob. Paul has significantly more experience overall, particularly at the intersection of law crypto, and IP negotiation. Based on his background, he also appears to have extensive experience with negotiating contracts rather than litigating IPR. Paul also highly involved in the crypto space, having made many public contributions to projects like Hyperledger, Sushiswap, Polkadot, Kali, Curia, Edgeware DAO, Flare, Codius, LexDAO, LobsterDAO and others. We like that he launched own law firm to assist crypto startups - this shows alignment with the space with skin in the game, and the entrepreneurial spirit is also relevant in terms of cultural fit for Maker. Overall, we found Paul\u2019s proposal to be more detailed and more explicitly spell out his agenda / what he seeks to achieve at Maker - which is important here we think. Change of Ownership of the Ambassador\u2019s Program Multi-Sig - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Sebix has taken over responsibilities of the programme in lieu of Kat so it makes sense to formally transfer signer responsibilities for the multisig.

Building a DeFi corpus as a leading DAO in the space can also have adjacent benefits for other types of analysis-augmented decision making. That said, we are unconvinced of the value of this analysis in improving the accuracy of the risk parameters. The OP claims it would lead to $ millions in additional value, but we have not seen evidence of this. For data models to be adopted for risk, they must be constructed with high quality inputs and battle / back-tested for predictive value. The proposed budget of 50k DAI seems overly large to allocate to fund this effort, given the models have not been back-tested and it is likely to increase rather than reduce risk in context of an increasingly uncertain market environment. We think it is valuable to have started this discussion as it can guide future thinking on how to adopt this type of analysis. Perhaps this can be redrafted with a smaller budget and reduced scope.

The prior expansionary stance was appropriate for a bearish market environment (although with limited effectiveness), but with expected growing demand for long positioning, we support increasing stability fees on high quality vault types like stETH. The c. $0.5 million increase in annual protocol revenues should help cover rising protocol costs while steering Maker back to profitability. Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Burn 2 million DAI worth of MKR 2nd choice: Burn 3 million DAI worth of MKR, as approved 3rd choice: Burn 1 million DAI worth of MKR 4th choice: Burn 0.5 million DAI worth of MKR Reasoning: We understand that DssKiln is a Maker smart contract module used for permissionless acquisition or sale of tokens held in treasury accounts. It is approaching the end of the audit period and will be ready for deployment soon. We believe it is important to provide value to MKR token holders by way of token burns (analogous to a dividend), as without MKR burn, MKR tokens hold only downside risk with little to no limited upside, as they are effectively lenders of last resort for underfunded vaults (setting aside governance rights associated with the token). Despite the change in market sentiment and Maker financial position, the DssKiln trial was already previously agreed via a community poll. It would go against precedent to revoke this vote given the earlier consensus (although we support a reduced burn amount in light of the fall in MKR price and volatile market environment). The proposed amount should have a minimal impact on the Surplus Buffer, and so we support a reduced burn amount of $2 million as 1st choice. Lastly, with RWA initiatives under way, we expect Maker to increasingly generate yield on its asset base, which it should pay out to MKR holders. Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support the motion to compensate CU members to their entitled amounts, as they should not suffer from the actions of their facilitator.  However we strongly feel the poll should include provisions that prevent such a situation in the future, which currently it does not. ",

However, we note that voting Abstain is often a valid choice if, for example, delegates disagree with both options. We believe 40% is a generous enough filter to ensure that valid use of the Abstain vote is allowed while discouraging lack of participation by delegates. Of course, delegation is also voluntary, so token holders can decide to support or not support delegates with a history of abstaining from votes. [Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023] (Maker Governance - Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023) (MIP4c2-SP28: Amend MIP51 to remove MIP51c4: Calendar Exceptions) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The governance process at MakerDAO is comprehensive and intense, and the break in December in light of the holiday seasons across different cultures and time zones is more than welcome. However, we agree that 1 month of no activity is excessive, given this break acts to delay rather than reduce the burden of governance participants. Therefore, we are voting yes to removing calendar exceptions with a view to reintroducing this as a reduced break of say one or two weeks, should other delegates agree.

We understand that MIP14 serves as a fallback mechanism to disburse funding in the event the requested funds fall outside of the scope of MIP-55. This goes into hypotheticals as we understand MIP-14 has not been used for CU funding in the past, but during this uncertain period we prefer to have maximum flexibility and so are voting against repealing this MIP.

[Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023] (Maker Governance - Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023) (MIP39c3-SP7: Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001)) Voted: 1st choice: Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 100% Multiplier for retroactive MKR - additional 107,317.50 DAI (CU-preferred) Reasoning: We understand that with the Endgame plan, the governance function is being consolidated toward GovAlpha, with potential re-employment of the GovComms team under a new cluster / function / MetaDAO in the Endgame structure. Before that happens, GovComms are seeking retroactive payment for MKR earned and vested, as well as a Golden Parachute payment as per offboarding of other CUs. As GovComms has provided valuable services to Maker and David is clearly a respected and valued member of the community, we are voting for a full payout of all retroactively earned MKR.

[Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023] (Maker Governance - Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023) (MIP55c3-SP12: Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs) Voted: Yes Reasoning: It remains crucial for Maker to continue monitoring the RWA assets during this transition / unwinding period and the proposed budget allocation appears reasonable in light of other SPF requests and the expanded mandate of this team. We also note @roo has done a good job of publishing RWA reports every month and support his continued work here.

We support funding of necessary activities, however this particular proposal is confusing to us given the overlap in team, mandate and sources of funding between legacy CUs, new MetaDAO clusters, and requesters of SPFs. Given the clusters are not finalised it also seems premature to be allocating what is effectively a temporary budget to that cluster. The use of funds for this SPF is unclear and could benefit from greater specificity. In particular, it\u2019s not clear what the funding will be used for besides compensation, given the projects are already live and monitoring would fall under the scope of the original funding already disbursed for these projects. The amount requested also seems very high in context of the financial position of the DAO.

Given this is an open call for external solutions provider and does not involve an allocation of budget at this stage, we are open to receiving proposals to consider options down the line.

We also support diversifying sources of yield to include both centralised / RWA and on-chain yield. However, the technical implementation handover will have to be carefully managed to ensure continuation as CUs are being wound down.

If a specific legal liability materialises in the future, we would support allocation of emergency funding to combat that liability, but this proposal seems unnecessary to us at this stage given it lacks a specific claim.

Given Maker is currently under Endgame rewinding process and focus on RWA clients, there is no need to digress and put extra efforts on designing a refund mechanism - maybe could insert additional warning when making DAI transfer instead. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP62 to Allow for Changing Communication Responsibilities (MIP4c2-SP33) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We welcome the continuous modification of existing MIPs to enhance protocol functionality and customer satisfaction. As such it makes sense to streamline the communication process in the event of a collateral offboarding. Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process (MIP4c2-SP30) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We agree with this proposal to limit the number of interim facilitators to one and help streamline responsibilities and incentives. The caps on term length ensure that interim facilitators don\u2019t become permanent, and majority approval helps to moderate the selection process. Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We support this proposal to onboard Cogent Bank. We see it as a relatively low-effort way to onboard additional real world lending and bring further RWA revenue streams to Maker (currently the main source of income for the protocol). We understand the deal will be structured on same terms as the HVB deal previously approved and positively received by the community. The underlying assets are moderate risk, short-duration loans originators by Cogent, a FDIC-regulated community bank, to borrowers in the Southwest US community. Supporting small businesses and homeowners with funds originated through DeFi is a welcome narrative and could bring credibility to Maker and the wider DeFi space. Given the ability to reuse existing legal structures and the commitment by Cogent and MaxStability to cover certain legal costs, we see this as a relatively plug and play deal. One factor to consider is that, unlikely prior RWA deals, there is no way to quickly liquidate the loan portfolio should Maker wish to reduce its exposure to the underlying assets (i.e. Cogent has no obligation to repurchase from Maker). In practice this is not likely to be a material issue given the underlying loans are short duration, but it may be prudent to assess potential venues where these loans could be sold should the need arise.

With the current average APY on USDC of 2.7%, the return generated from DeFi farming should also be trivial. Therefore, we take this proposal as an attempt of boosting capital efficiency of PSM assets, exploring diversified revenue on DeFi space, and building a beneficial relationship with Yearn. In light of the approval of MIP92, we support Maker CUs to start working on the implementation of the bespoke Yearn Vaults. Additionally, though there was a USDC de-peg crisis a few days ago, we regard the alarm has been cleared as USDC has rebuilt its peg and SVB saved by Fed - PSM flow will likely stabilize soon.
