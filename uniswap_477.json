Also, the token economic model is very sound. We cannot control Market forces, and doing another airdrop to try would be futile. The initial surge of tokens would mean all the people who originally sold would probably sell again, this time at a much higher price, further dropping the price of UNI and allowing whales to scoop it up. In order to maintain optimal tokenomics, the application should function within it\u2019s utility. Occam\u2019s Razor - the simplest solution is usually the best solution. New distribution models and somewhat arbitrary data would only convolute the system and weaken the overall peeception of competence in government on Uniswap, which is important for the price; if a system makes poor governance decisions, small token holders are more likely to sell, large groups are more likely to come in and completely reorganize the system. Additionally, the market is healthy. We\u2019re experiencing a normal correction currently. I personally think the best way to accomplish better LPs and more distributed addresses is to bring back incentivized pools, but include a _maxPoolPercentage function that scales with CurrentLiquidityETHValue param. In this manner, the first liquidity provider could obviously have 100% of the pool, but from N+10 accounts and approaching a higher number, the maximum percent of pool each address can hold goes down until UNI reward parity is reached. This should only be the case for incentivized pools, as it is beneficial when a whale provides a lot of liquidity on one token pair. I think there\u2019s plenty to work with and on in the current model before introducing separate governance expansions. For data purposes, I would be interested to see how the first cohort deals with the first major community led upgrade. ",
