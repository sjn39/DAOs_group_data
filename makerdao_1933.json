                    "content": "Disclaimer: Information published below represents the official position of the Collateral Engineering Core Unit as a team.  Risk Summary/Key Takeaways   The technical smart contract risk is considered MEDIUM, as it will be using existing and already live in production MIP21 contracts and MIP22 Centrifuge Tinlake conduits. However the fact that the integration utilizes contracts outside of Maker\u2019s scope and has not been extensively reviewed by Maker increases the technical risk. Furthermore, the increased operational overhead of managing 4 vaults instead of a single vault, results in increased maintenance directly in executive spells, which also increases the technical risk.   Whilst technical risk is considered medium the proposed solution requires manual/human monitoring, which will require  clear processes for assessing the ongoing performance of the collateral based on the reporting required by the various actors.   Due to the manual operations of RWA vaults, CES recommends that for future deals consideration is made to limit the amount of maintenance work required in executive spells. This analysis is based on a future perspective where if more of these types of deals get submitted to Maker, it could potentially dramatically increase the amount of vault facilities that would need to be managed directly in executive spells, which increases the overall technical risk in the Maker Protocol.   Any technology required for the monitoring and uploads of data to off-chain infrastructure is not in scope for this technical assessment.   The counterparty custodian infrastructure and security is out of scope of this technical assessment.   The Centrifuge Tinlake platform infrastructure and its security is out of scope of this technical assessment. Readers should note that notwithstanding Centrifuge Drop Tokens are underlying collateral as these are not held directly by Maker Protocol smart contracts. Any enforcement of liquidation or rights would require enforcement in the real world through TACO - the real world trust that has entered into a secured loan agreement with Blocktower Drop SPV the holder of the Drop tokens.

In case such external systems fail, this assessment recommends that that primary reliance be on the legal documentation for ensuring the obligations between the parties are met.  Modifications to standard MIP21  MIP22 Centrifuge Tinlake Conduits This vault utilizes the Tinlake Manager contract instead of a conduit, to facilitate the Dai flows between the RwaUrn and the Tinlake Pools. This contract is the same that is live in production for RWA-002, 3, 4, 5.  Setting up the vault   Deploy contracts:   4xAuthGemJoin   4xRwaUrn   4xRwaToken   4xTinlakeManager (Done by Centrifuge)     Deploy executive spell which:   Sets all risk parameters for the vault (see table in \u201cTransaction Outline\u201d above)   Sets BlockTower TinlakeManager contracts as operator of the RwaUrn contracts   Sets DsPauseProxy as auth role for the RwaUrn conracts.   Send the RWA tokens into the respective TinlakeManagers.      Drawing Dai/Paying back Dai Dai is automatically supplied to/withdrawn from the Tinlake Pools to provide liquidity using the Tinlake Manager which is granted the operator role on the RwaUrn, and is thus authorized to call draw/wipe.  Paying vault fees Stability fees accrue automatically to the surplus buffer.  Liquidations & Losses   Monitoring of the RWA investments happens off chain.   Maker Governance can manually trigger a liquidation event by calling the Liquidation Oracle in an executive spell.   In case a liquidation is triggered the Trustee will begin selling collateral assets and pay back Dai to the RwaUrn.   If the RwaUrn has not been fully repaid after a liquidation event, Maker Governance can write off the debt to the surplus buffer using the LiquidationOracle through an executive spell.    Emergency Shutdown   Dai holders will be able to redeem Dai for RWA010-13 tokens through the End module.   Subsequently RWA010-13 token holders can swap RWA010-13 tokens for a proportionate amount of USDC in the RwaCageSettlement contract.   The RwaCageSettlement is still in development, but very close to being completed. When this contract is finished, it can also be reused for other RWA vaults.   The fact that this contract is not live in production yet is not a blocker to initiate the vault, as existing RWA also lacks this easy onchain redeem functionality in case of ES. The plan is to deploy this contract as soon as it is ready.    Architecture  MIP21 Contracts In order to onboard Blocktower Credit Vault the MIP21 standard contracts and Tinlake Adapter (MIP22) utilized in Centrifuge vaults will be utilized. 4 vaults with different debt ceilings will be setup to integrate with 4 Tinlake Pools. MIP21 turns off automatic liquidation of the vaults and ensures that the borrower is prevented from minting more DAI than the Debt Ceiling (line). Any liquidation of a vault would require that Maker Governance trigger a liquidation. For the proposed implementation, the following MIP21 and MIP22 contracts will be utilized:   RwaToken   RwaUrn   RwaLiquidationOracle   TinlakeManager   As part of the spell, after the Urns has been set up the spell will lock the ERC20 tokens into the RwaUrn, to allow of Dai minting up to the specified debt ceilings of the vaults. Below is a summary of the contracts which will be utilized.  RwaToken Source code A standard implementation of the ERC20 token standard, with the balanceOf(address) of the deployer of the contract being set to 1 WAD at deployment. There are 18 decimals of precision. There are three state changing functions, that are all available to the token holder, and are specific to the ERC20 token standard:   transfer(address dst, uint wad) external returns (bool)   transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint wad) public returns (bool)   approve(address usr, uint wad) external returns (bool)    RwaUrn Source code The RwaUrn is unique to each MIP21 collateral type. Aside from the core DSS wards, can, rely(address), deny(address), hope(address), and nope(address) functions, there are five functions:   file(bytes32, address)   lock(uint256)   free(uint256)   draw(uint256)   wipe(uint256)   exit(uint256)   The file function can only be called by governance (via the auth modifier) The rest of the functions can only be called by those who have been given the operator permission (hope\u2019d or nope\u2019d) on the RwaUrn contract. And any Dai drawn by the RwaUrn can only be sent to the RwaOutputConduit address defined by governance when deploying the contract. In this case the RwaOutputConduit address will be the custody address of Monetalis.  Tinlake Manager Source code The Tinlake Manager contract integrates the RwaUrn with the Tinlake Platform. It takes the place of the conduits in a standard MIP21 setup, and routes Dai between the Maker Protocol and the Tinlake Platform.  RwaLiquidationOracle Source code The RwaLiquidationOracle contract consists of six state-changing functions (besides the usual DSS rely(address), deny(address)), all protected by the auth modifier and can only be called by governance:   file can be called by governance to change the vow address (used in cull).   init is the initialization function. It takes 4 parameters:   ilk: name of the vault, in this case, RWA010.   val: estimated value of the collateral token.   doc: link to legal documents representing the underlying legal scheme.   tau: minimum delay between the soft-liquidation and the hard-liquidation/write-off.     bump can be called by governance to increase or decrease the estimated value of the collateral.   tell can be called by governance to start a soft-liquidation.   cure can be called by governance after a soft-liquidation has been triggered to stop it.   cull can be called by governance to start a hard-liquidation/write-off. This will mark all the remaining debt of the vault as bad debt and impact the Surplus Buffer (vow).   There is one externally accessible view function called good(bytes32) that anyone can use to check the liquidation status of the position. This function does not change contract state. This is not a typical Maker Oracle. It will only report on the liquidation status of RwaUrn, and can only be acted upon by governance. This oracle is not vulnerable to flash loan attacks or any manipulation aside from a governance attack.  Contract Risk Summary The reader should note that his assessment is solely with respect to the smart contract transactions and interfaces required to effect the on-chain state changes required under the proposed architecture and excludes any technical functionality related to the technical infrastructure required for monitoring and uploading data to MakerDAO offchain storage and ongoing monitoring. Furthermore, this assessment does not take into consideration the operational and technical security of the counterparties and it systems of BlockTower or Centrifuge.  Risk Analysis Conclusion: Medium technical risk The RWA code implementation resides within a sandbox-like environment, and any operation not related to locking, freeing, drawing, or wiping in the RwaUrn must be voted on by governance. The code itself is lightweight. This implementation uses simplified Oracle and Urn contracts to achieve the functionality required for this specific instance of RWA. Furthermore, MIP21 contracts and the Tinlake Manager contracts have been live in production for over a year. However the fact that this vault integration utilizes smart contracts from external sources, outside of the Maker Protocol scope, and has deep integrations into the Centrifuge platform that has not been reviewed, increases the technical risk of this implementation. In terms of technical maintenance of the proposed system, utilizing numerous vaults to facilitate a single deal increases the complexity and required technical maintenance in executive spells, and therefore slightly increases the technical risks. Therefore the technical risk of this implementation is considered MEDIUM.
