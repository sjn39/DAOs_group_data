On May 25th we celebrated our first year as a DAO. Throughout the year we\u2019ve published weekly newsletters with the latest and greatest from the various moving parts of GitcoinDAO. Today I\u2019m thrilled to share our very first edition of a yearly review!  The Year in Review aims to encapsulate the highlights and accomplishments from last year and recognize our fantastic set of contributors, stewards and workstreams. Part of the document is also dedicated to explore this new year of possibilities and ambitions. This last year has been incredible and I\u2019m grateful and humbled to be part of such an amazing group of individuals tirelessly working towards building a better future for all. Sending virtual hugs to everyone who helped and a very special thanks to @umarkhaneth & @IamJvck  (Psst, there is a puzzle hidden within the document. The first person to solve the puzzle will receive 200GTC and a $100 merch coupon for the Gitcoin swag store, good luck!)  GitcoinDAO Year in Review22623\u00d7228 39.6 KB  ",
