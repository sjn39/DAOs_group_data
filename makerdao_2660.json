I have had personal discussions with a number of people here and while my time constraints are limited I believe Maker is coming to an important junction that needs some input/discussion. To this end I am opening up a new forum thread titled \u201cLong Term Vision for Maker\u201d where anyone and everyone can dream up and think about what they see as what Maker could/should look like 1,2,5,10,20,50 years in the future. The goal with this thread is two fold:  Understand what the greater community sees as the future for Maker and allow people to verbalize this so that perhaps the community can come to a collective view of the future of Maker to drive activities/work. As we approach a collective vision (or find that we are significantly divided) perhaps we can get to some ideas to nail increasing problems or things that are requiring more governance attention.  Maybe we can settle on ideas that will simplify the work of Maker to make things easier for all of us as well as make the system overall better.  For now rather than post my vision into the OP here I leave this as an open space for everyone else to think about and post their visions for Maker just like I will here at some point. Thank you again for your participation. It is you and all of speaking up with our own voices that makes Maker better for us, and everyone else. I see @SebVentures pretty much started this earlier than me so rather than dilute overall discussion I post a link there and if I get no posts here we can all huddle over there.
