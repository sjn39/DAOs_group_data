Welcome everyone to LexMaker episode #2. Today we are discussing a legal framework for decentralized autonomous organizations. The topic is broad, and it is on purpose.

We are pleased to have you here and thrilled to have you sharing this. For other episodes of CUT, please check the forum.

Using governance token is it a security or not? 30:55 - Xavier Lavayssi\u00e8re: Are UNAs  recognized internationally? 34:50 - Kianga Daverington: In terms of the capital appreciation of the token, would that be considered distribution of profit, or we are talking about a different type of asset transfer to the holders? 42:25 - Juan: Can you give an example of the interests being transferable for us mortals that do not speak the legal lingo that well? 43:20 - Juan: In the UNA, would you not be able to transfer it? Would you not be able to sell the governance token? 53:46 - PaperImperium: Can a UNA own another entity that has equity, such as an LLC Corporation? Can a UNA later transition to a more formal profit-seeking entity if it matures and decides to distribute profits? 56:45 - Robin Nagpal: When we talk about exchanging the tokens, selling and buying on the secondary market, will the governance tokens will always be considered as securities? 59:18 - Juan: If anyone has any questions watching later, what is the best way to reach you?  Closing Comment  Juan  Outro 1:00:05  Thank you very much, people, for coming. It has been great.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.
