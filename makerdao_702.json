We are developing best practices and a process flow that we hope to share with the community soon which will include a template CU facilitators can leverage to populate expenses. Longer term, we will automate the expense reporting with a script developed by the SES Core Unit which will greatly streamline the process Collaborating with SES and the Delegates to design performance evaluation processes and metrics for Core Units. As @Rune mentioned previously, MKR holders lack transparency into Core Unit activities and there is minimal if any accountability short of threatening to offboard a Core Unit. The community needs a neutral way to assess the performance of each core unit and to hold them accountable for their performance. The expectations of the community, delegates, and MKR holders must be clear to CU facilitators and there must be a forum for alignment on a CU\u2019s mandate and key objectives. Putting a formal process in place will prevent a lot of headaches in the future and improve communication. Shoutout to @Longforwisdom for being the guinea pig and helping out with template design   ALM research led by @SebVentures, which will be instrumental for us in:  Allocating stablecoins held on the protocol\u2019s balance sheet, reducing USDC centralization and generating yield through investment-grade short-term credit investments  Understanding our solvency risk to ensure the backing of DAI and our liquidity risk to maintain the peg of DAI Deciding as a community what our risk appetite is as it relates to the above   Quarterly Strategic Reviews (QSRs)  Q4 QSR deck is nearly complete thanks to contributions from @Tadeo and @piotr.klis on the data side, the Risk, Growth, PE, and RWF teams. We are looking forward to discussing the analysis with the community and encourage everyone to attend the inaugural meeting as we look to build consensus and refine the meeting over time. We\u2019re planning on scheduling the first meeting at the end of the month once the teams return from ETH Denver   Building out the financial and data infrastructure by collaborating with the DIN team - testing out building PowerBI dashboards leveraging the DIN Snowflake database  Public Work Why Accounting Matters ALM Framework History of Dai at Par ValueJanuary Financial Report January Financial Report December Expense Report Team Composition @Aes - Full-time - Facilitator @SebVentures - Full-time - ALM, Financial Infrastructure @Kayleigh - Part-time - Financial Planning & Analysis @Shravanrajas - Part-time - Data Analysis ",
