                    "content": " TL;DR We have people creating uncensored builds of the UI which are just following Uniswap Labs ones but without the block list. Let\u2019s use this for uniswap.eth instead of app.uniswap.org. To do so create a multisig validating uncensored builds of uniswap made by peoples like @Micah and point uniswap.eth to an ENS that this multisig control. Then when a new version is made, someone publish it, the multisig review it, and it if it\u2019s fine then the multisig approve the change updating uniswap.eth.  Details Recently uniswap labs updated the UI to stop supporting lots of tokens, some obviously makes sense like Tether Gold which is bugged and lock liquidity forever. But most tokens are just what the US regulator would likely classify as securities such as :  mAssets (mTSLA, mGOOGL, \u2026 thoses are synthetixs of shares) Synths.  There for me multiple issues with this:  This applies to everyone, even outside of the US juridiction. (there might be some legal ground about that, maybe since Uniswap Labs is in the US they must apply thoses regulations even to non US \u201ccustomers\u201d) The message is a missleading \u201cunsupported token\u201d instead of \u201cThis is not supported on this gateway, pls use an other gateway\u201d.  So ok the uniswap labs team doesn\u2019t want or can\u2019t deal with the legal implications of this. Then let just find someone else who does.    GitHub    Release Release v4.11.1-uncensored \u00b7 MicahZoltu/uniswap-frontend IPFS hash of the deployment:  CIDv0: QmRoaxLP3DZv2srDQXLXxsGQzfgkFpnFwyrN9Z6PEACJSD CIDv1: bafybeibtpf7upsc66ojaaem657k67qzp6fwhqg3zfnhia5sjn5nwrqk5qi  https://uniswap-uncensored.eth.link/ You can ...      Well @Micah is willing to do it. This is just a fork of the Uniswap Lab\u2019s UI but with the list removed. Technically, we just update the IPFS field of uniswap.eth to ipns://uniswap-UI-multisig.eth, instead of ipns://app.uniswap.org. That would change the resolution of:   uniswap.eth (for thoses who use IPFS) uniswap.eth.link  We would also need to have a multisig checking releases, because for example if we just point it to ipns://uniswap-uncensored.eth well that would work, but @Micah would have full control over the code that is distributed, which isn\u2019t very decentralised. Sadly app.uniswap.org wouldn\u2019t get updated as it\u2019s uniswap.eth redirecting to app.uniswap.org not the reverse. That pretty much it. As is this wouldn\u2019t have much impact, because very few people uses uniswap.eth, but it would be simple to advertise https://uniswap.eth.link instead, it\u2019s from the governance and should be as safe.

I think there could be an interesting application built that would create a unique fork for every user who is looking to use Uniswap protocol. i.e. everyone can launch their own IPFS attestation of uniswap UI (user A pushes button that launches a IPFS of latest UI that can be used and reused; bonus if the user can also customize the UI background logo etc to their own personalization).
