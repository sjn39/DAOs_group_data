                    "content": "One-layer recursive proof composition can be achieved for pairing-based zkSNARKs (e.g. Groth16) using chains of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Such curves were introduced in ZEXE, namely: BLS12-377 and CP6-782. Later a new curve was constructed in [HG20] to replace CP6-782 with very efficient implementation, namely BW6-761. There are many implementations of this new curve in different languages (Rust, C++, Go, Go/Assembly). This thread is to discuss the EIP-3026 related to it. We want to get community feedback and assess public interest in this curve getting into Ethereum. Note that for gas schedule, we followed EIP-2537 for estimation but haven\u2019t proposed constants yet because there are many implementations and Ethereum clients and we\u2019re looking for comparing them, so help is wanted.
