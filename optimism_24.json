The context of this question is that Team members may have advanced notice on future funding criteria\u2019s, and can capitalize and incentivize users into their own projects.  However, I also do see honest value space for Team members to independently build (if they have any extra time). For instance, if a new physical city was being built, many initial developers have ties to the founding of that city itself.  Those developers may open libraries, universities, banks, etc, all to benefit the general public.  At some point the developers placement and access may begin to shift from help to control. Just some thoughts. Thanks!! ",
