The Hub could offer various types of Free training tools and courses for the next generation of builders, users, investors, etc. Content mediums could range from a recorded class model like Coursera, to live seminars and \u201clabs\u201d, to manuals, articles and more and could perhaps be produced in part by key figures at various dapps and projects who are willing to impart their knowledge to those who could benefit from their expertise. Funding could come from PGF, incentivizing people to share, support, mentor, build, and create. I feel that it\u2019s important to keep education free so there are no barriers to knowledge. Again, this is just a thought to get a conversation started. ",
