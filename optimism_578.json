Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via Pendle\u2019s AMM.  21400\u00d7515 278 KB  The Pendle AMM is purposely built for trading yield derivatives in a capital efficient manner with negligible impermanent loss due to the pool pair being strongly correlated. Yields are often cyclical in nature and typically swing between highs and lows (much like a pendulum!). Typically, the floor and ceiling for the yield of a liquid asset are much easier to predict than its price. For example, the annual yield of staked ETH is likely to fluctuate in a band of 0.5\u201312%. Knowing the rough yield range of an asset enables us to concentrate liquidity within that range. Given the previous example, our AMM can be optimized for such a range on staked ETH. The result is something conceptually similar to UniV3\u2019s concentrated liquidity whereby liquidity is utilized much more effectively, while still retaining fungible LP tokens.  31400\u00d7792 95.6 KB  The AMM model\u2019s curve is specifically designed for yield trading. As time passes, PT and YT prices naturally shift as they approach maturity. The AMM curve automatically shifts to account for these changes, such that one will only trade the interest rate changes and not the prices of the individual assets. The curve shifts also adjust the model to be more capital efficient as we approach maturity by taking into account the fact that PT trades closer to the underlying asset price (for example, it becomes infinitely capital efficient at the maturity where PT trades 1-to-1 against the underlying asset). You can learn more on what Pendle enables you to do on our dedicated Learn Page. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: Pendle brings the TradFi interest derivative market into DeFi. In traditional finance, interest rate swaps are the biggest market in the world at > $500T. PT is the equivalent of zero-coupon bonds while YT is the equivalent of coupon payments. Pendle is positioning itself to become a core infrastructure for the next phase of DeFi.  41257\u00d7954 122 KB  By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:  Long assets at a discount Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral A mix of any of the above strategies  We have also been getting a lot of traction from the community, helping educate other users and covering unique yield trading strategies, e.g.:  Delta-neutral farming by 2Lambroz: https://twitter.com/2lambro/status/1630917100402532357  Louis Cooper covering Pendle mechanics: https://twitter.com/LouisCooper_/status/1612743314092232706  DeFi Made Here covering on-chain interest derivatives: https://twitter.com/DeFi_Made_Here/status/1628771658361196544   With various yield-bearing protocols already existing on Optimism such as Sonne Finance, Tarot, and QiDao to name a few, it makes sense for Pendle to deploy there to create a market for yield trading. How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate.: We looked at all the transactions that has interacted with our contracts and filter out all the unique wallets. Unique Addresses: 431  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: Our grant proposal outlines a two-pronged approach to incentivize the usage of yield-bearing assets on Optimism and to deepen liquidity. Specifically, we will incentivize:  Liquidity providers on Pendle\u2019s pools. This enables Pendle to acquire deposits that reflect back to the total value locked of the integrated underlying protocol, such as Sonne Finance, Tarot, QiDao, etc. Liquidity providers on the PENDLE/WETH pools on Velodrome, in order to deepen liquidity between the pairs.  All OP in the grant will be used on the two approaches above to distribute to Optimism users for their benefit. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Our UI has two modes: Simple and Pro. The Simple UI and Pro UI run on the same set of contracts and use the same set of yield-bearing assets.  6812\u00d7112 31.6 KB   7812\u00d7112 8.34 KB  The Simple UI provides a simplified user experience that is more accessible to retail and new users. It has the same pools, tokens, and contracts, with a streamlined Dapp for two main functions: buying assets at a discount and providing liquidity. The Pro UI, which targets more sophisticated and DeFi-native users, gives users the full suite of functions on Pendle, allowing users to execute any yield strategies by freely buying and selling PT and YT. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: We will provide a platform for users to speculate on yield trading for yield-bearing assets in the Optimism ecosystem. An asset in consideration is the sAMM-WETH/sETH pool on Velodrome Finance with $31 million of liquidity (https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/manage?address=0xfd7fddfc0a729ecf45fb6b12fa3b71a575e1966f). Historically, we see on average of $4.8 million in trading volume in our first month of supporting a new ecosystem. With Optimism, assuming the same traction, we can expect at least $4.8 million in trading volume and $3 million in TVL. Furthermore, we aim to attract users to interact with Optimism by offering a 52-week long incentives program on Pendle\u2019s pools. This program is designed to incentivize volume and deepen liquidity in the Pendle pools. We expect users to use and interact with Optimism through Pendle even after the end of the incentives program due to the financial opportunities available of being able to trade yield on Pendle. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Dapp: https://app.pendle.finance/  Website: https://pendle.finance/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/pendle_fi  Discord/Discourse/Community: https://pendle.finance/discord  Github: https://github.com/pendle-finance  Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.pendle.finance/   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Below are the following metrics as a measure of traction since launch of Pendle V2: Transactions: ~1.8k transactions TVL: $24 million Volume: $21.6 million on Ethereum, 976k on Arbitrum (6 days since launch on Arbitrum) Our contribution to Aura TVL since integrating their protocol on Ethereum (https://dune.com/cheeezzyyyy/pendle-market-pool-liquidity):  56% growth on Aura\u2019s rETH-WETH pool since launch (12th Jan 2023)  Aura liquidity grew by 7.4k LP; Pendle contributed 4.2k LP   13% growth in Aura\u2019s wstETH-WETH pool since launch (9th Feb 2023)  Aura liquidity grew by 30.8k LP; Pendle contributed 4.1k LP    Unique Addresses: 431  Other protocol metrics can be found on our analytics dashboard:  https://analytics.pendle.finance/ The recent Arbitrum launch grew the number of unique addresses significantly. When Pendle is launched on Optimism, we can expect the same or greater metrics in terms of unique addresses, TVL, and volume given the strong traction of some of the popular yield-bearing tokens there. Competitors: Element Finance, APWine, Sense, Swivel Finance Audits: https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core-v2-public/tree/main/audits   Team  Who are your founders?: TN Lee, CEO | previously Head of Business at Kyber Network | Twitter: tn_pendle Vu Nguyen, CTO | previously Lead Smart Contract Developer at Digix | Twitter: gabavineb | GitHub: mrenoon What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal?: Pendle has pioneered yield-trading derivatives in the DeFi space and has been operational for 2+ years without facing any major vulnerability. Pendle V1\u2019s (launched last June 2021) traction has garnered $350 million in notional traded volume supporting a wide range of assets, from stablecoins to tokens with 80,000% APR. With our Pendle V2 launch last November, we have achieved $23 million in TVL and $22 million in cumulative traded volume. We have worked closely with other DeFi projects in the space such as Aave, Lido, Convex, LooksRare, Aura, Balancer, LayerZero, Celer, and many many more. Is this your first Web3 project?: No. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): The team has history building in the Web3 ecosystem and has contributed to projects such as Kyber, Digix, imToken, DefiLlama, etc. The team has also proposed EIP-5115 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5115) in order to standardize the fragmented yield market. Building on top of the ethos that inspired ERC-4626, EIP-5115 or SY is a new interface standard designed by Pendle, to wrap all yield-bearing tokens into a single standardized yield interface.   Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request?: 200,000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?:  3,673 OP per week will be used to distribute equally among the Pendle pools as incentives over a period of 1 year (52 weeks). A total of 191,000 OP will be used for this initiative. Aside from the underlying yield of the pool itself from swap fees underlying protocol yield, PENDLE incentives will be distributed as well as those pools are voted for to channel incentives to via vePENDLE. 3,000 OP per month will be distributed to the PENDLE/WETH pool on a DEX such as Velodrome over a period of 3 months. A total of 9,000 OP will be used for this initiative. PENDLE incentives will be matched as well to help deepen the liquidity in these pools.    Roadmap and Distribution Plan  Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: Once the OP grant is received, we will:  Prioritize deployment of the Pendle protocol on Optimism; Launch with a set of yield-bearing assets as launch partners in the similar vein on how we did it on Ethereum and Arbitrum; Deploy a portion of the grant on an incentives distribution contract for the Pendle pool LPs on Optimism; Work with a DEX on Optimism to set up liquidity for PENDLE/ETH, and deploy a portion of the OP grant along with matched PENDLE incentives in order to deepen liquidity; Continue the cycle of supporting more yield-bearing assets to create more yield markets, and allocate a portion of the OP grant to those pools to deepen liquidity;  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here):  95.5% of the allocation will be for LP incentives on Pendle, targeting 3,673 OP distributed equally among the pools per week for 52 weeks. As it stands, LPs receive swap fees generated by the pool, PENDLE incentives, and protocol incentives emitted by the underlying asset. Having additional OP incentives would encourage users to deepen the liquidity of the Pendle pools on Optimism. 4.5% of the allocation will be used to incentivize PENDLE/WETH pools on a DEX on Optimism, such as Velodrome, targeting 3000 OP per month for 3 months.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:  52 weeks for Pendle LP incentives for 95.5% of the OP allocation; 3 months for DEX LP incentives for 4.5% of the OP allocation;  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Month 1 : Deployment of the Pendle protocol on Optimism, with 1-2 million cumulative TVL and 100k cumulative trading volume at launch; Month 3 : 2-5 million cumulative TVL and 150k cumulative trading volume on the Pendle deployment on Optimism; Month 6 : 5-8 million cumulative TVL and 200k cumulative trading volume on the Pendle deployment on Optimism; Month 12 : 8-12 million cumulative TVL and 300k cumulative trading volume on the Pendle deployment on Optimism;  Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Milestone targets:  200-350 users on Optimism; TVL mentioned above; Total accumulated trading volume to be $20M or higher on Optimism; Continuous collaboration with Optimism-native projects and listing their yield-bearing assets, targeting to support at least 2 new yield-bearing assets per quarter; Maintaining our top position as the yield-trading avenue on Optimism; Leveraging Pendle\u2019s reputation to bring more users to Optimism as we work with future partners; Helping to expand the Optimism ecosystem in the SEA region as we\u2019re open to working on growth experiments together with OP Labs and the Optimism community;  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Pendle has devised a strategy to sustain usage on Optimism by:  Continuous listing of new yield-bearing assets to allow users to trade yield and hedge yield risk; Create developer tools that allows anyone on Optimism to create markets on Pendle permissionlessly in the same vein of Uniswap; Closely work with liquid lockers and bribe markets to continuously vote on the Pendle pools on Optimism for channeled PENDLE incentives;  There will be PENDLE incentives allocated to other ecosystem activities on Optimism beyond just liquidity mining. Pendle plans to grow and maintain long-term collaboration with the Optimism team and the various projects native to Optimism in order to grow the Optimism ecosystem. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Pendle smart contracts have been audited by Ackee, Dedaub, Dingbats, and some of the top wardens from Code4rena such as cmichel, WatchPug, and leastwood.  81920\u00d71046 96.9 KB  DefiLlama: https://defillama.com/protocol/pendle CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pendle   Optimism Relationship  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Since Pendle is a yield-derivatives protocol, it expands the use of any yield-bearing asset on Optimism. Different strategies exist for various stakeholders:  Traders: able to leverage yield opportunities without locking up principle; Arbitrageurs: profit by rebalancing the market inside Pendle\u2019s custom AMM engine; Liquidity providers: provide liquidity on the Pendle AMM for yield (swap fees, protocol incentives, PT fixed-rate interest);  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Aside from what\u2019s already been mentioned above, we plan to grow the Optimism ecosystem by:  Onboarding new users to Optimism through the support of popular yield-bearing assets on Pendle markets; Exposing the Pendle and yield-trading communities to the greater Optimism ecosystem; Aiming to be one of the top projects in terms of TVL; Working closely with the most talented developer community;  Is your project Optimism Native?: No. Ethereum native, but planning to deploy on Optimism.   Confirmations  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes ",
