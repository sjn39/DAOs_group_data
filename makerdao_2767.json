At present >> zero << USDs of available credit have been utilized of the ~1.4MM USD in the RWA Senior Lending Trust account. Thus today, the RWA001-A vault is backed entirely by cash. The recent loan closing to start this process was done 100% with the equity of 6s Capital Partners LLC, Series A (which enabled the underlying real-estate to be acquired by the borrower). Currently there is a senior secured lien (filed) on a commercial real estate property in Illinois in favor of 6s Capital Partners LLC, Series A to >> allow for << credit to be extended from the Trust in the future. This closing was done with a title company to ensure independence. For any USD to be released by the Trustee from the Trust (for this transaction or any other), LendCo has to meet the definition of collateral in the Credit Agreement (which includes delivering an already completed independent appraisal, completed by a licensed appraiser, underwriting and all other applicable closing documents / binder). Note: the appraisal for this first project was completed 05 Oct 2021, well in advance of our closing to ensure 6s\u2019 underwriting requirements were met. Subject to the Trustee\u2019s consent, all remaining LendCo-approved budget draws will be funded by the Trust (for this one specific project) up to but not excess of the budget approved by LendCo\u2019s underwriting. As the underlying lien is already in place, the Security Agreement in concert with the project specific lien provide the foreclosure path. Today, there is no credit extended therefore nothing to foreclose on as today the Trust only has cash in it. That will change the moment that $1 of credit is extended to LendCo from the Trust. At that point in time, the Trust would have foreclosure rights. Today, 6s is in the exceptionally rare window where there is a lien in preparation for credit, but no credit has been extended (yet). Logically, all the requirements have been met to allow for that credit, less an official request from LendCo to the Trust. The above said (and since 6s does not only want to do one deal at a time) should 6s close on another project before the draws are all deployed (on the first project), 6s will be relying on maintaining compliance to the ratios within the Credit Agreement (this is by design) across all projects on a portfolio basis. It is for this reason, this structure scales. The more projects that 6s wants to do in parallel, the more equity 6s needs in place to ensure compliance. This process is a continuous iterative process driven by compliance and adherence to the Credit Agreement. Please see the RWA001 document roadmap for more information. ",

Hopefully in the future the state of the business in terms of borrowing and senior secured deposits within trust will be available in the UI.  I know this will require an on-chain transaction but it might be the cleanest way to deal with this vs. having to make a manual post each time a borrow is executed and collateral added.  The idea system managers would have to go to multiple threads on forums to get this data - is unappealing to say the least. Ideally this would be something that would come directly from the Trustee as then this is their stamp of approval of vault situation change and a report on collateral u.nder the Trust as senior secured status.   Basically it would show the DAO directly via the standard UI the state of the vault from CR status, signed and sealed by the Trustee wallet via a on-chain transaction. I would hazard given everything you are doing this is probably a backburner thing but it would be something really important.   Basically what MakerDAO (and as LendCo btw) want is to have the Trust verifying the 1.4M is sitting in cash and the collateral status.  We would have to talk to Protocol Engineering about how to engineer the on-chain reporting UI/data via the Trust, but once that is done then any displays can wrap the UI around it. I think this is cleaner for you and your time offloading the on-chain reporting requirements to the Trust manager and then RWA/RWF CU basically just acting as Q/A. ",

I think most of us understand the trustee makes sure all of this is done according to contract.  My point was it would be nice when these RWA vault state changes happen for the trustee to confirm via a on-chain trustee signed transaction with the actual new vault status info including:  collateral secured valuation state of the borrow, etc (in 6s case it is sitting in cash waiting to meet collateral if I understand his post correctly) giving the system a CR value and vault state.  We (meaning MakerDAO and CUs etc.) are not going to want to go fishing through separate forum threads for changes to collateral states for all RWA players and vaults we plan to onboard. My entire post point was that this information flow should:  Originate from the Trustee. be on-chain to be easy to hook UI displays into. to Save MakerDAO from having to fish around for it and RWA borrowers from having to \u2018explain\u2019.

Maybe to some of them they could have been asked earlier, but this is a good time to ask now that the structure has been implemented and we\u2019re not talking in \u201cwhat is supposed to happen\u201d but at the same time the value lent is not out of Maker reach.  My motivation in asking them is (1) to understand where there is transparency or opaqueness, (2) use parts as potential building blocks for structures to work for below 25 million loans, given this structure was approved by the community.  They are not asked in the context of trying to punch holes - I want this to work and for you to be successful - and so do not feel compelled to put down your drink of choice and punch out an immediate response. Silence for a couple days will not be interpreted as anything. How and who was the 1,400,000 DAI requested and obtained, if not through a borrow request under the credit agreement by 6S?  If not a borrow request, why would 1,400,000 be obtained before there was a borrow request? The 3% stability fee started accruing the moment the 1,400,000 DAI was obtained from the contract? The Trust owes that stability fee?  Is 6s obligated on a corresponding loan with the Trust to pay interest from the time the stability fee began, or as an origination fee must pay the Trust what has already accrued as a Stability Fee? Does any portion of the interest owed to the Trust, or the accruing stability fee, need to be paid before the loan maturity in 2024? As to the smart contract, with the RWA001 token locked 15 million can be obtained by the Trust without the Trust proving anything further to Maker, right? At this point, Maker\u2019s asset is its beneficiary interest in the Cayman company, which is the owner and beneficiary of the Delaware Trust?  So, prior to the Trust obtaining any collateral, Maker\u2019s interest is in the $ in the Trust\u2019s account?  Is that amount publicly available anywhere and/or does the Cayman company report that regularly to Maker?  Should that beneficiary interest be reported as part of Maker\u2019s balance sheet, valued now as the cash in the Trust\u2019s account and later as the value of collateral? If 6s makes a borrow request, can the Trustee refuse to make it on the basis of the Trustee wants more collateral?  I ask that as I read the credit agreement and it says the Trust shall lend funds to 6s on the borrow request date, and that 6s shall provide/assign whatever security it got from its subsidiary to back the loan, but I didn\u2019t see anything that makes 6s get certain collateral from the subsidiary. When 6s makes a borrow request, in what way will the collateral documentation provided to the Trustee such as mortgages be available to Maker, at least after the fact? What is the Trustee charging for fees, and when did/does that start?  Have fees already been paid to the Trustee, and I assume that was by the Trust?  Will those fees be passed on to 6s as borrower? Does the Trustee have to give notice to the Cayman company or Maker before it pays itself from the Trust? Thanks. ",

                    "content": "Who owns those $1.4M is not an easy answer.  At the first level, you can say that the Trustees are holding the $1.4M. They will certainly not be kept liable for not paying accrued interest tho (but you can be sure that they will hold some to pay themselves if needed). This is an accurate answer, but it is quite useless. The account is held by the Trust for the benefit of the CaymanCo that is for the benefit of the Red Cross Cayman (with a bit of simplification). Again not useful, they have no power in the structure and will not see a dime. The Trust Agreement is clear that the DAI facility is for the benefit of 6S. You can argue that as soon as there is a draw it is 6S problem to reimburse. Not saying it is correct, but you can understand that. If you exclude intermediaries, there are only two parties: the lender (MakerDAO) and the borrower (6S). The question, therefore, is where you put the Trust and the CaymanCo. The Trust is directed (in the sense of a directed trust) by CaymanCo (but limited by the Trust Agreement). The CaymanCo is directed by Crestbridge acting for a client (I will assume 6S or an affiliate, that might be wrong, but in any case, it\u2019s the borrower that chose the client). Nothing forces Crestbridge to listen to the client but there are also not many limitations.  It is my view that this is a borrower-controlled structure. Again, controlled doesn\u2019t mean that the borrower can do whatever it wants. The borrower side presents it as purely administrative powers. With MIP58 (based on Ogier\u2019s recommendation, and the same ideas are present in Monetalis), the legal conduit is directed by MakerDAO. MakerDAO can instruct the intermediary to do things (noticeably to report). From the legal memo kindly shared by Monetalis:  The interests of the MakerDAO community will be protected by a combination of the usual protections on which the institutional holders of asset-backed securities rely and a robust trust arrangement which will effectively be controlled by the community via the governance arrangements set out in the trust instrument.  (trust is what I describe here as CaymanCo for simplicity as the trust should hold a company for its operation, which is why, in some jurisdiction, a Foundation is easier as it is combining both in one) Implementation of a MakerDAO controlled structure is nevertheless more complicated as trustees are less comfortable working for a DAO and being public about it. The messaging mechanism is not that easy neither. All this is solvable nevertheless. In both cases, you should make sure that all the intermediaries are paid. MIP21 itself being an unsecured loan (as the token used as collateral is a dummy one, and as we can see even taking in account the cash at the Trust, it is already undercollateralized), it is my view that ultimate control of the intermediary by MakerDAO (not the borrower, not a core unit, not a Maker Representative but the MKR holders) is of paramount importance. Otherwise, you end up having lent 1.4M DAI but the borrower telling you he didn\u2019t borrow anything. ",

THIS INFORMATION IS PRESENTED \u201cAS IS\u201d FROM 6S CAPITAL; RWA COMPANY LLC TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACCURACY.  Hi OmahaLawyer, As I\u2019ve mentioned, Matt has retained the services of RWA Co. to help engage with forum/governance activity while he focuses on growing the operating company. In that light I\u2019d like to attempt to answer some of your questions, with the caveat that I may need to gain clarification from Matt on certain technical points. Also thank you for asking this publicly so that we can continue to work towards a proper \u201cFAQ\u201d on how the current structure operates (and potentially address and discuss its limitations).  How and who was the 1,400,000 DAI requested and obtained, if not through a borrow request under the credit agreement by 6S? If not a borrow request, why would 1,400,000 be obtained before there was a borrow request?  What happens is detailed in this post that I put up on our website, but I\u2019ll provide a brief summary. Once DAI is drawn from the Vault it flows to the secure conduit contract (MIP21), of which the receiver address belongs to the broker-dealer. The broker-dealer has irrevocable instructions from the CayCo. (who is legally sending the funds to it) that whenever it receives Dai from this address it should only convert it to USD and send it to the CayCo\u2019s escrow account. This escrow account is held with WSFS and also has irrevocable instructions that when it receives USD from the broker-dealer, it should only send these funds to the Trust Account. Once the USD is in the Trust Account it is now under the control of the Trust Agreement. I\u2019ll note that up to this point, the Credit Agreement has not been used, this is only the process of getting the Dai into USD in the \u201creal world.\u201d Only three things can be done with the USD once it\u2019s in the Trust Account: (1) It can be lent out pursuant to the Credit Agreement, in which it will then begin accruing interest, (2) it will remain in the Trust Account and likely be held in short-term government securities, or (3) it can be returned to the Escrow Account, which then has similar irrevocable instructions to only send the USD back to the broker-dealer, who then also has similar irrevocable instructions to convert this USD to Dai and send it back to the secure conduit (i.e. the Vault). Note: This is the circuit path test that Matt did to evidence this path before it was used on a larger scale.  The 3% stability fee started accruing the moment the 1,400,000 DAI was obtained from the contract?  The stability fee began accruing at the Vault level, but will not be reflected in the Trust until it has been lent out via the Credit Agreement. The same issue arises when accounting for the fees of the intermediaries. It is correct that this causes a discrepancy between what the system believes it has earned versus what it has actually earned. I personally like to frame this similarly to the way that ETH Vaults carry Oracle costs that are not accounted for at the stability fee level, but taken out of income later on. This issue was detailed in this post for reference.  Does any portion of the interest owed to the Trust, or the accruing stability fee, need to be paid before the loan maturity in 2024?  It is my understanding that the loans accrue interest on top of the debt, similar to the way an ETH Vault operates. I believe this interest compounds quarterly.  As to the smart contract, with the RWA001 token locked 15 million can be obtained by the Trust without the Trust proving anything further to Maker, right?  The entirety of the debt ceiling can be drawn to the Trust at any time, at present it could be held in cash at the Trust or deployed pursuant the Credit Agreement.  At this point, Maker\u2019s asset is its beneficiary interest in the Cayman company, which is the owner and beneficiary of the Delaware Trust? So, prior to the Trust obtaining any collateral, Maker\u2019s interest is in the $ in the Trust\u2019s account? Is that amount publicly available anywhere and/or does the Cayman company report that regularly to Maker? Should that beneficiary interest be reported as part of Maker\u2019s balance sheet, valued now as the cash in the Trust\u2019s account and later as the value of collateral?  RWA Co. is responsible for reporting at this point in time. We intend to make monthly reports to the forums (and on our website and ultimately via API and published on-chain) once the Credit Agreement has been utilized. While we don\u2019t have any legal obligation to MakerDAO (as no one really can), our reputation is our primary asset and is being pledged as \u201ccollateral\u201d in representing the accuracy of this information. Direct reporting from the Trustees is a goal that we\u2019re working towards but will take a considerable amount of time to get them comfortable with.  When 6s makes a borrow request, in what way will the collateral documentation provided to the Trustee such as mortgages be available to Maker, at least after the fact?  If I\u2019m following, I believe you\u2019re asking if documents like appraisals can be made public once they\u2019ve been presented to the Trustee? I\u2019m going to have to defer to Matt for a more detailed reply, but I\u2019d imagine that this is not practical. The Trustee confirms the existence of these documents and will not allow debt to be drawn from the Trust without them - Maker, at the very least, needs to trust that they will perform that function correctly. As for the content of these documents, it would be great to know what information you find critical so that RWA Co. can present this information to the community in a privacy-preserving manner.  What is the Trustee charging for fees, and when did/does that start? Have fees already been paid to the Trustee, and I assume that was by the Trust? Will those fees be passed on to 6s as borrower? Does the Trustee have to give notice to the Cayman company or Maker before it pays itself from the Trust?  Trustee fees will be outlined in the reporting from RWA Co., specifically to address the discrepancies between Vault stability fees and actual accrued interest. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head what the fee is but I can get back to you. I do know that thus far Matt has personally covered the fees for various service providers, including lawyers and Trustees. Legally speaking, the fees come out of the interest accrued in the Trust (I\u2019d draw on the Oracle example again and would advise that it\u2019s probably unreasonable to expect borrowers to cover these), but it will have to be a conversation between Matt and the MKR holders to determine who foots what bills at the end of the day.

In May, we have three more closings that should tentatively utilize an additional ~$12.6MM (two Tesla projects and an ORLY). As outlined above, toward the end of Q2 and then Q3 (we are scheduled to close another ~$20MM of Tesla projects) and Q4 are where the Tesla transactions start to hit, though the specific number is still materializing. Tenants are pushing to have additional locations on a pace that is exceeding our expectations (a wonderful problem to have). Each of the above real-estate transactions requires a lead time of 45-60 days to select the lender of record. As a result, I am actively engaged with the RWF team to get everyone comfortable such that sufficient credit is available. I do not want MakerDAO to miss-out on these transactions. A debt ceiling increase signal request will be published soon to address the above. Thereafter (or even possibly in parallel), I will be working with the community on an upcoming arranger application as a bold new way to bring on other types of collateral along with a framework on how to scale RWA. There will be an extended RFC phase (minimum 60 calendar days) on the arranger application to allow for the community to ask questions. ",
