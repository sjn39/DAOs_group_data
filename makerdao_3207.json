We\u2019re doing KYM #04 that\u2019s focused on the KEG. We\u2019re going to start with the wonderful Payton, who\u2019s going to give us the non-technical MIP overview. That will kind of fill in at the high level for everyone. And then we\u2019ll also dig into the technicals with Sam, who also submitted a technical MIP, which is now an RFC. For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.  Discussion Payton Rose and Sam MacPherson Discussion 00:46 The Keg1920\u00d71080 106 KB What&#39;s the Keg?1920\u00d71080 112 KB Why utilize the Keg?1920\u00d71080 119 KB Key terms for applying for Keg funding1920\u00d71080 116 KB Pause for questions1920\u00d71080 158 KB  09:26 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Regarding the gas and the transaction fees, does the contract keep some ETH on the side?   14:23 \u2014 Amy Jung: Does it have to stream instead of doing one chunk at a time?   15:29 \u2014 Robert Jordan: Regarding the frozen period of four weeks and the frozen period of two weeks, how specifically does that work?   17:28 \u2014 Robert Jordan: If you have a core unit and a budget attached to that and a facilitator, does this also overlap into that process as well? Because once the budget\u2019s approved, that\u2019s approved through the normal MIP process. Is this an additional process if we\u2019re using the Keg to fund a budget for a core unit?   18:47 \u2014 Amy Jung: If you were a core unit that proposed six months, then you don\u2019t necessarily also have to use the Keg; you can just say \u201cHey, every month I want X amount and we\u2019re going to deliver this work.\u201d   19:40 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Hypothetically, if the Surplus Buffer did go very low and we had to mint MKR, how long would it take for the distribution of the new Dai if we had to unfortunately mint new MKR?   21:00 \u2014 Amy Jung: Can anyone send money to the Keg, not just Maker Governance?   21:35 \u2014 Robert Jordan: If a budget is tied to a core unit and there\u2019s been some agreement on that, and if the Surplus Buffer runs low and some sort of austerity needs to be applied, has there been any discussion on that and how that would happen?   23:50 \u2014 Tim Black: Can you unpack how flights are registered or the addresses? I\u2019m not quite getting that part   24:38 \u2014 David Utrobin: Should there be streams towards individual contributors or should it all just go to one address and then that one address, whether it\u2019s controlled by a single facilitator or some multi-sig, then distribute it according to the budget at their own discretion?   25:37 \u2014 David Utrobin: The other day there was a presentation from a company called Accountable; they would be a service provider to core units that wanted to offer fiat payments and a more traditional range of benefits for their employees. And I think the way that it worked was that the payment would go straight to them and then they would do all of that. So in this case they would just get a Keg route through a single contract address. That\u2019s how they would set it up, right?   26:49 \u2014 David Utrobin: I don\u2019t know it Accountable or another similar company would want an upfront or some sort of deposit for service, basically. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. Because if it\u2019s streaming, it might not be ideal for that service provider.   28:04 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Are there any core units that are looking to use Accountable?   30:49 \u2014 Amy Jung: I don\u2019t know if everyone got a chance to read the Flapper distributor, which is one the use cases that Payton was going through. There was a lot of discussion about it, but essentially instead of the flights being core units, for example, it could direct to an operational budget that then distributes to core units that then distribute to their contributors. So I was wondering if anyone thought of using the Keg at that level of abstraction versus it being directly tied to core units  1920\u00d71080 171 KB  35:40 \u2014 Derek: The streaming function of the keg is designed to stream to, let\u2019s say, a core unit multisig, for example \u2014 not necessarily to individuals. I\u2019m sure people would like to be paid at a streaming rate from a multisig. What would be the complexity in offering such a thing or perhaps working with a Gnosis multisig type offering that would allow individuals to be paid in a streaming manner from another entity or wallet, in this case.   38:54 \u2014 David Utrobin: Does the Keg has a bandwidth for a max number of streams?   39:51 \u2014 Greg: Is it possible to store a Dai from the Keg on xDai or some sort of L2 solution?   41:28 \u2014 Amy Jung: Can you give us any other insights into what some of the risk may be?  Closing Comment Amy Jung Outro 43:53  Thank you so much, Payton and Sam. This was really cool. It\u2019s a crazy crypto world that we live in. Thank you for everyone who also came. If you have any questions, we\u2019ll be posting also the video follow-up to this and we\u2019ll also be posting it on the forum as well and you can also ask questions there if you\u2019d like. Thanks, everybody.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
