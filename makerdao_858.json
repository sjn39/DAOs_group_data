If this is explained somewhere that I\u2019ve missed (probably the case), feel free to just point me towards that. Looking at vote.makerdao.com right now I see the new \u201cSet the Dai Savings Rate Spread\u201d, currently showing \u201c59242.81 MKR in support\u201d. To the left of that it says \u201c17577.64 MKR needed to pass\u201d. The current proposal looks to have passed on Feb 21 with 88061.02 MKRs in support, so from my understanding the new proposal would need to surpass this to be enacted? But 59242.81 + 17577.64 would not add up to this, far from it. And it also way more than the \u201c48592.17 MKR in support\u201d currently at the governing proposal, if that would be what\u2019s required\u2026 What am I missing here? ",
