                    "content": "Hey everyone, I have previously briefly disclosed my investment into Monetalis, a company that is trying to onboard scalable RWA collateral to the Maker protocol, including with MIP65 and other collateral onboarding applications. I originally invested in the company with a relatively small amount of money only in the interest of getting it funded because it\u2019s clear to me it can provide a big benefit to the community by realistically providing RWA collateral that can scale, while also understanding the clean money initiative and being based outside of the US. However, it\u2019s become clear that my interest in the company has been major distraction, and as a result I have decided to give away my shares and end my involvement with the company as an insider. My plan is to create an independent foundation that can take ownership of the shares, and then based on a predetermined schedule would hold and then sell the shares, and transfer all net proceeds to the Maker surplus buffer. Perhaps following a simple strategy such as selling 50% + a fixed amount (for anti-dust purposes) of its remaining shares every 4 years. There is already such constructions in place for other companies in the Maker ecosystem, so I know this is possible in theory. However, I still need to find out if it is practical to do from a legal and tax perspective based on my own personal situation. If it turns out not to be possible my plan is to just give the shares to one of the other existing members of the company. This should clear out any concerns around my involvement with Monetalis and hopefully ensure we can move forward with doing scalable RWA collateral onboarding with less complications ",

Having personal financial entanglement in other projects is fairly common in this space, and although we should be cautious of this I usually default to giving the benefit of the doubt at this stage. From what I\u2019ve seen most people who are heavy into the DAO seem to be able to set personal financial entanglements aside when doing what\u2019s best for Maker. ",

Does Maker want to risk being viewed as funding connected (and not so qualified) insiders with off-market generous loans?  What would this perception do to the value of MKR and DAI? Also, If the terms (and financial backers) of a given Maker loan were published in the front pages of the Financial Times/Wall Street Journal how would it look to outsiders? ",
