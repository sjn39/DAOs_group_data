Build truly cross-chain applications using the Synapse Protocol. Synapse is comprised of a cross-chain messaging framework and an economically secure method to reach consensus on the validity of cross-chain transactions, enabling developers to build truly native cross-chain apps. Synapse Bridge is built on top of the cross-chain infrastructure enabling users to seamlessly transfer assets across all blockchains. The Bridge has become the most widely-used method to move assets cross-chain, offering low cost, fast, and secure bridging.
