                    "content": "GitcoinDAO has different starting conditions than most other DAOs. One effect of that is traditionally, people working at the Holdings company (corporate) have made salaries/benefits - like any corporation.  Gitcoin Holdings (the company that existed when the DAO originated) had a policy of paying team members US competitive market-rate-for-technology-companies-salaries, which in some cases, meant that often times our compensation policy meant offers were generated at compensation levels comparable to this:  Screen Shot 2022-05-14 at 12.34.08 PM902\u00d7338 65.2 KB  Screen Shot 2022-05-14 at 12.33.56 PM910\u00d7296 45.5 KB   Screen Shot 2022-05-14 at 12.33.53 PM712\u00d7314 53.1 KB  Of course, Gitcoin Holdings has venture funding & a business model (and revenue generated from doing virtual hackathons) that has allowed the corporation to generate offers in this category.  And even so, it is losing lots of money every month as it supports Gitcoin Grants (so perhaps this is not sustainable). The DAO does not, as far as I know, have a model for financial sustainability yet. But it does seem that the DAO has inherited the company\u2019s compensation policies in some areas. I am writing this post because I see this trend is about to collide with market conditions. I want to name that.  By naming this trend, the DAO can get ahead of it. I believe that this sentiment is echoed in other stewards posts during S14 governance:    [S14 Voters Guide] Lefteris' Guide   I am running a company building opensource software in Berlin, Germany. We have a very constrained budget, yet we build amazing software. We are 7 people and we burn less in a year than some workstream budgets have asked for a quarter. I don\u2019t know if they all expect \u201csillicon valley\u201d salaries but considering the market conditions I feel a strong urge to say no to all this spending.   Lefteris has told me privately that full time contributors to Rotki make $30k - $50k per year.    Griff's S14 voter\u2019s guide   For me the funding requests in general were just too much\u2026 way too much. I come from the perspective of Giveth, Commons Stack and Token Engineering Commons and most of these proposals are asking more than their yearly budgets!   Griff has told me privately that Giveth contributors make $19/hour.   GivETH v2 shipped with about $500k in funding. By way of comparison, Gitcoin Holdings pays roughly $300k/mo for software engineering.  And the DAO spends about $150k/mo on Moonshot Collective (the only software engineering organization natively in the DAO). Gitcoin has still not shipped Grants 2.0.  Here are some more thoughts on why.  Open Questions This leads me to a few questions I think the DAO should consider?  If I were to start this project all over again, should I have gone the Giveth/Rotki route? Is the DAO in for more hard times if it continues Holdings\u2019 compensation patterns? Should GitcoinDAO pay six-figure salaries to its full time contributors, like the Holdings company did (perhaps unsustainably)? Is there a DAO-wide compensation policy in the works?  Should this policy be consistent in both times of abundance & scarcity? Can the DAO sustain these compensation policies if we are no longer the market leader? What is the DAOs compensation model?  What are the workstreams compensation models? What would have to be true for the DAO to create great software, become a market leader, get to financial sustainability, and pay web2-competitive salaries (the virtuous cycle I personally think the DAO should be aiming)?  I understand that these may be painful conversations to have.  But I see no alternative to getting these hard governance questions out in the open. As always, please remember I am just one node in the DAO network - and I have perspective given how long I\u2019ve been in the project, but the governance of this question (and other matters of import to the DAO) are up the governance process.

So It\u2019s true. We are ready to pay up to $80k for the most senior engineer position but we have not yet found a good match for such a position. But indeed from these numbers you can see, that a lot is possible with smaller numbers. And it\u2019s not we don\u2019t want to pay more. We just can\u2019t afford it since we are a small self-funded startup with some community support via gitcoin grants.   If I were to start this project all over again, should I have gone the Giveth/Rotki route?   I would definitely have gone with something leaner. But in retrospect we are all geniuses.   Is the DAO in for more hard times if it continues Holdings\u2019 compensation patterns?   Absolutely. This is not sustainable.   Is there a DAO-wide compensation policy in the works? Should this policy be consistent in both times of abundance & scarcity?   That would be nice and would make sense as part of the DAO Ops subgroup.   Can the DAO sustain these compensation policies if we are no longer the market leader ?   It\u2019s not a question of can (I think it can\u2019t), but if it should. And imo it should not. It should try to become a lean machine that spends only as much as it needs to spend and not a penny more.  If there is any income, that income creates a surplus and we got abundance then we can revisit this.   What is the DAOs compensation model? What are the workstreams compensation models?   So far I see each workgroup doing their own thing and following no rules/framework/patterns. It would be nice to standardize everything as part of the DAOOps workgroup.   What would have to be true for the DAO to create great software, become a market leader, get to financial sustainability, and pay web2-competitive salaries (the virtuous cycle I personally think the DAO should be aiming)   Here I am gonna say something you may not like to hear. I don\u2019t think DAOs can build good software. A DAO is a very political machine, getting into governance, trying to get everyone heard, doing votes, politics and what not. Good software is built by 1-2 architects/CTO and a small, lean and effective development team. I don\u2019t think a DAO can build good software. Perhaps it can hire a team that will be able to and maybe create a very good and clear specification for them to implement. ",

An idea I\u2019ve heard recently in another context that might help is to provide as a central service core capabilities such as a pipeline and frameworks, tools and processes for sprints & epic planning, and so on.  We could look to instrument these in a DAO-friendly way also - so for eg enforcing design discipline in a pipeline & also rewarding following the process via recognition (poap-like for code reviews). TBH I\u2019m learning a lot about GitCoin over the last couple of weeks.  It might be that the above sort of patterns are already in place.  I\u2019m mostly reacting to your comment \u201cno rules / framework / patterns\u201d.  As you know from Deming and all others of that ilk, if you want to improve a process - step 1 is to have a process in the first place   If you have pointers as to where our processes for software dev are documented, I\u2019m happy to stake a look and educate myself.

Assuming we are not in an emergency state currently, I propose this: We set a date ~1 month before the start of S15 to have a group strategizing call. In this call we present options that do justice to the humans of Gitcoin as well as to its mission. Options like: a) salary reduction for all b) new hires brought on at a lower rate, with leveling period across a few months where high salaries are lowered and new hires are raised (to find equality without making an earthquake in ppls lives) c) take a furlough d) high context/high salary folks go to 1/2 time Having this conversation in late June allows us the time to observe the market. It allows us the time to develop these options (treasury moves should be a big part of what\u2019s creating options here IMO, and we just haven\u2019t made those moves yet). And it creates space so that we\u2019re not making rash decisions. The future of work honors people\u2019s autonomy by giving them all the info they need to make the best decisions for their lives and for the causes they serve. At the same time, psychological safety is important and we owe it to ourselves to not YOLO some paycuts (as long as we are not in emergency state as I said at the top). ",

An other long term option would be to use GTC as a utility token and create a new governance token. The virtual token used for CowSwap seems to be an idea we could learn from. Based on the twitter post above and the virtual token idea, we could compensate contributors with a standard ERC20 in conjunction with vGTC for which the amount could be weighted based on the contributions made or other params. But this would lead to a centralized governance model, so if anyone that is not a contributor wants to get involved in governance, then they could buy the utility GTC token and redeem it for vGTC.

                    "content": "This is an interesting conversation, and feels to me like it\u2019s flipping the script on web3, in a negative way. The narrative during times of abundance was that web3/DAO work offers an alternative to web2 in that it gives you more flexibility and optionality in terms of what you can do, without having to sacrifice financial incentives. What I\u2019m hearing in some of these recent conversations is flipping to a more \u201cif you\u2019re passionate you\u2019ll work for below market rate and be open to being exploited\u201d mindset, which has been highly toxic in the web2 non-profit space. I get that we\u2019re entering times of scarcity, but I think we need to be mindful of the effects of this narrative-shift and what long-term effects it could have on the space. Another thing to consider is the costs associated with a significant compensation reduction - i.e. if there\u2019s a mass exodus beacuse current contributors can no longer afford to work at Gitcoin DAO (given that a large proportion of the core team is in the US, where the salaries we offer aren\u2019t excessive by most measures), how far back would this set current projects, and what would the costs of rehiring/restructuring the DAO be? Just think there\u2019s a lot of nuance that needs to be taken into account when discussing people\u2019s livelihoods haha. ",

Even in a worst case scenario of GTC going to $1 to 1.5 the dao will have ~$50 to $75 million (vested + unvested) in its treasury. So if we cap max spending at lets say 1.5 mil per season. Then even for 3 yrs (12 seasons) DAO would at max spend 18 mil i.e ~30-40% of treasury and hopefully by the end of 3 years we would be out of the bear market. In case if the market conditions improve we can remove the spending limit early. All workstreams should split this max budget i.e 1.5 mil based on their contribution levels for core DAO goals etc. Couple of things to note:  The spending limit per season can be a % of treasury rather a fixed USD amount like (1.5 mil). The spending limits can be set both at DAO level & individual work stream levels as well. Along with a DAO wide comp policy, if we have a spending limit for each workstream, it makes it easier for the workstreams to reorganise themselves accordingly to fit the new spending limit.  ",

                    "content": "I would like to offer a few comments here. from @lefterisjp comments:  Good software is built by 1-2 architects/CTO and a small, lean and effective development team. I don\u2019t think a DAO can build good software. Perhaps it can hire a team that will be able to and maybe create a very good and clear specification for them to implement.  My understanding is that a DAO is \u201cjust\u201d the organization model for running a project, the same that it could be an LLC. With so many people here involved in open software, and this being an important factor in the mission, how can we reach this conclusion? Aren\u2019t there enough examples of good running open-source projects with high quality? (Linux, Gnome, WordPress, IETF, etc). Note, that I\u2019m asking from total unknowledge,  I never participated in an open-source project. Btw, not sure if this could help: https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/185 From @owocki :  Lefteris has told me privately that full-time contributors to Rotki make $30k - $50k per year.  I\u2019m in Europe too, we hire globally, and I\u2019m not even able to attract juniors for a $30k salary. Our seniors are around $80k, and if I find a superstar is almost free check. I\u2019m a startup with no too many resources, so imagine with what we are competing for talent. And I don\u2019t believe that we would attract that talent just because they are aligned with the mission, people want/need to secure their future. I think the tech market is currently in a bubble and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s gonna explode at any time soon. On top of that, working for DAOs has many advantages, you can work for many DAOs at the same time ( this may be an advantage for the person, but I don\u2019t think it is for the DAO, from my point of view if we detect good people, we want them 100% focus on us, and in their free time, enjoying their life, so they can recharge and come with energy the next day, maybe this is an old-fashing though). But it also has many risks from a stability perspective: I have one task now, but It\u2019s not sure at all that I would have a new task once a finish this. So I would have to go out there hunting for new bounties, grants, or freelance jobs. What about illness? pregnancy, vacations, holidays? Along these lines, I was thinking about something to introduce some kind of recognition for the track record of a contributor: Hey, you have been here for 3 months, doing an excellent job, here you have an NFT, that you can exchange, at any time, for 2 days off (numbers from the example are just random). This could create loyalty from the contributors, and people may value this on top of just salary/reward. @kyle :  I am starting to really see the value in some \u201cstable\u201d portion of compensation, and then a \u201cvariable\u201d portion of compensation. Having to sell your voice (aka, governance tokens) to pay bills doesn\u2019t feel good.  I totally agree that people should sacrifice compensation for having a voice. This may be a total change of subject, but I\u2019m investigating an alternative to 1-token-1-vote governance model. I like more a system based on reputation, where your reputation\u2019s score rewards your alignment with the mission and penalizes the opposite. Those reputation points can\u2019t be lifetime, I think they should work like the ATP ranking. So people needs to contribute constantly during periods of time, in order to keep their scoring, instead of doing one task and living from that reputation for the rest of their days. @bhargavaparoksham :  Even in a worst case scenario of GTC going to $1 to 1.5 the dao will have ~$50 to $75 million (vested + unvested) in its treasury. So if we cap max spending at lets say 1.5 mil per season. Then even for 3 yrs (12 seasons) DAO would at max spend 18 mil i.e ~30-40% of treasury and hopefully by the end of 3 years we would be out of the bear market. In case if the market conditions improve we can remove the spending limit early.  I think this is very short term vision. It doesn\u2019t matter if this bear market last 3 years or the next one, or maybe there are some external factors that dump the price to zero. The DAO should look for a way to increase its revenue and be auto-sustainable. Managing the treasury and being sure that it can resist market conditions is one piece, but sooner or later, the treasury will be gone. Some quick ideas:  Looks for financial contributors, there are a lot of non-profit organizations and foundations raising funds from wealthy people. What about taking tokens/equity from the projects that the DAO helps? I think there is a lot of knowledge in this DAO, many other DAOs can learn from it (I\u2019m researching this in detail for the one that I\u2019m creating). This DAO can create tools and service that facilitate the management of this DAO and charge for it to other DAOs.  ",

Note, that I\u2019m asking from total unknowledge, I never participated in an open-source project.   Sure there are! But they are not made by what we call DAOs now. An opensource project tends to have 1-2 architects, 3-5 core contributors and then any number of occasional contributors. Without the main person behind it, the maintainer, the project usually dies. Good projects try to go around that by having multiple maintainers and/or when someone steps down they try to find a replacement.     Layn:  I\u2019m in Europe too, we hire globally, and I\u2019m not even able to attract juniors for a $30k salary.   Then you need to work on your hiring process. It\u2019s very easy. Try angellist.co, twitter, and the job boards of whatever language/frameworks you use. If your work is opensource go to opensource job boards. Many people really appreciate the chance to get paid to work in opensource. Paying $80k for a good senior sounds good. Also for Europe. But if budget is tight (like it is with rotki) can be accomplished with less. The most important thing to find is people aligned with the vision of what it is you are building and try to pay them as good as your budget allows. The reason salaries and prices are mentioned is because this DAO is overspending and burning money like there is no tomorrow while there is zero revenue coming back in and \u2026 well let\u2019s be honest. It has shipped very little (nothing?) in the 1 year since its inception.     Layn:  I think this is very short term vision.

Irrespective of market conditions the DAO needs to become sustainable. Right now it\u2019s simply burning money and I don\u2019t see any revenue coming in. Your ideas also sound cool. Gitcoin grants 1.0 has the optional (but by default set to 5%) fee that goes to Gitcoin holdings. How about switching that to being revenue for the DAO at some point? Or at the point gitcoin grants 2.0 comes along? ",

                    "content": "On the topic of revenue - I do think there is an option in the near future to start charging operational/management fees for the growing number of Ecosystem rounds we are running. Most of my time over the past few years at Gitcoin Holdings was focused on managing the virtual events/hackathons business, which did bring in a good amount of revenue via sponsorship fees. I\u2019ve now transitioned to focus pretty much fully on Grants, specifically ecosystem rounds, and I am moving from Holdings to the PGF workstream. A lot of work goes into managing ecosystem rounds (not unlike hackathons) with partner/grantee onboarding, education, operations, marketing, payments, etc. We\u2019ve never charged fees for matching pool donors in the past because we obviously want 100% to go to the community, and funders are not really purchasing a service they are making a generous (charitable) donation. But I think it\u2019s a bit different for ecosystem rounds - while main pool and cause round donors likely don\u2019t see any direct immediate benefits (besides exposure + goodwill), ecosystem round sponsors are specifically funding the growth and development of their own protocol or community (and not necessarily open source/public goods broadly). Something I\u2019ve been thinking about as we move towards Grants 2.0 with more self serve features - ideally, anyone can run their own self serve QF round at any time they want, while Gitcoin will still host our big main rounds, with more hands on management for specific ecosystems or causes. It won\u2019t be possible for PGF to scale and run all rounds, but if your option is to do all the work yourself or have Gitcoin manage it for free, many will opt for the latter. So I think eventually some type of fee or cost to cover DAO overhead for managed ecosystem rounds will be inevitable. The important thing to weigh is the value of some additional revenue in the near term (and maybe it only makes a small dent in burn) versus the risk of slowing down growth and adoption. Personally, I think given the market pressures we\u2019ve seen as of late, it might make sense to begin generating some DAO revenue sooner rather than later. But I don\u2019t think everyone agrees yet, curious what others think. ",

Any steward may raise a claim of conflict to be addressed prior to a vote being finalized on Tally. If a conflict is found, any related vote must be redone and may be considered passed so long as the steward in conflict abstains and the quorum rules are met.

The DAO Ops budget does compensate me (as a contributor I currently make 1850 GTC a month), but no other workstream compensates me. The conflict of interest clause is one we should remind stewards of, as I think most WS leads are also stewards with a fair amount of GTC delegated to them. IMO, no one steward has the ability to approve or deny a budget on their own though. It usually takes three of more (at a minimum) to really move the vote (if they went against all other stewards/community members). ",

To be fully transparent here: future and further compensation will be negotiated here for all your awesome work, and you consult on multiple workstreams so your case is actually an example on why it is important to keep on refining this clause, there\u2019s always so much context. Very happy that a first paragraph on this made it into v3 now though. And yes, one steward cannot turn the vote but ofc they do influence others. Having power spread out over more non-contributing stewards would be a good thing, but then we ofc also need to work on how to incentivize them. ",

Such a group would start with listening + then perhaps through building consensus eventually recommend policy back to the DAO.   +1 on this. It should be more than just a group strategy call, it should be a taskforce that looks at all the salaries but starts with an intake meeting.     loietaylor:  a) salary reduction for all b) new hires brought on at a lower rate, with leveling period across a few months where high salaries are lowered and new hires are raised (to find equality without making an earthquake in ppls lives) c) take a furlough d) high context/high salary folks go to 1/2 time   Looking at these options only option b) makes sense to me (I like that one a lot). Although I know it is just a \u2018conversation starter\u2019, it is within the domain of people ops to provide some guidance here and I hope some more options can come up to equalize pay first before we eg go for a dao-wide reduction or potentially ask some of most high context (often highest performing) contributors to go to 1/2 time.  I think what Saf describes here is a realistic scenario\u2026     safder:  f there\u2019s a mass exodus beacuse current contributors can no longer afford to work at Gitcoin DAO \u2026 how far back would this set current projects, and what would the costs of rehiring/restructuring the DAO be? Just think there\u2019s a lot of nuance that needs to be taken into account when discussing people\u2019s livelihoods   \u2026 and we should at all cost avoid a talent bleed of the DAO. I personally can live with a paycut but at the same time I believe in fair treatment of all. Measuring of people\u2019s performance is not easy but this discussion shows how important it is to at least establish some standards (urgently) we can adopt dao-wide, and we\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time. Salaries are pretty random from my view and in a bear market tensions around this will probably only rise. I\u2019ve seen private and public discussions around what some people make and I\u2019ve seen other workstreams being very good at hiding how much some people actually make. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done here and great to see that we\u2019re broaching this topic.  Some final thoughts after reading up on all of the above, looking back at the original Qs:     owocki:   If I were to start this project all over again, should I have gone the Giveth/Rotki route?    No, coming from Giveth I can be clear about this.  We all made the exact same (extremely low) salary, no matter how hard or long you worked or how efficient you were. It really was painful at times, for many. People should always be compensated for what they do. No system is perfect but we should try to find a balance.     owocki:   Is the DAO in for more hard times if it continues Holdings\u2019 compensation patterns?    Probably yes. All salaries should be revised, this should by the way also include legacy rules with vesting plans from holding employees. This is a very unbalanced situation that should also be addressed while we\u2019re at it.     owocki:   Should GitcoinDAO pay six-figure salaries to its full time contributors, like the Holdings company did (perhaps unsustainably)?    We should pay the correct market value but take into consideration our own financial situation and adapt where necessary, esp. for people who are overpaid or whose pay has never been evaluated by people ops in terms of what makes sense in the market, performed hours, peer review etc. There\u2019s no dao-wide system in place here at the moment.     owocki:  Is there a DAO-wide compensation policy in the works? Should this policy be consistent in both times of abundance & scarcity ?   We do not have one but afaik it is in the works, this was in people ops\u2019 OKRs last season and it is in there again for this season.     owocki:   Can the DAO sustain these compensation policies if we are no longer the market leader ?    Let\u2019s start by drafting one, take context into account and go from there.     owocki:   What is the DAOs compensation model? What are the workstreams compensation models?    Does not exist/is not consistent/unknown.     owocki:  What would have to be true for the DAO to create great software, become a market leader, get to financial sustainability, and pay web2-competitive salaries (the virtuous cycle I personally think the DAO should be aiming)?   Have a clear purpose and intents from which a lot of logic can come to make easier decisions, and a strong people ops team to create policies that makes sense to all workstreams and continually evolve given our own ever-evolving context.

This is something Workstream leads have asked for from the stewards. More specifically, \u201cWe want to know what the DAO budget is, and then we can determine how to spend those funds amongst us\u201d We are starting to explore a few options to help remove ambiguity here. Something like a sliding scale of compensation make-up (ie, what % is in stables and what % is in GTC) based on GTC price. And then also taking a look at treasury sustainability, to ensure that we have (ideally) 10+ years of runway. This may not be possible with the current market, but we are planning to be a project and DAO that stands the test of time.     connor:      lefterisjp:  Gitcoin grants 1.0 has the optional (but by default set to 5%) fee that goes to Gitcoin holdings. How about switching that to being revenue for the DAO at some point? Or at the point gitcoin grants 2.0 comes along?   Just want to note the optional 5% fee goes directly back into the matching pool for future rounds, no revenue for Holdings or the DAO. This changed about a year or so ago, before that the option did go to funding the Gitcoin core dev team (pre-dao).   This was a change more than a year ago (nearly 2 years ago). We instead created a grant to fund the core development. It too has now been made inactive and we have no inflows to supplement development. This is something we have started to evaluate if we should change. Here is one idea for example. ",

It is a matrix that looks like this:  Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 5.37.52 PM2192\u00d71076 355 KB  But ours would be tailored to match the competency that is most important in web3 and Gitcoin specifically. Typically an org uses this matrix to determine a salary offer before a hire is brought on. But in the instance where our pay is not equal thus far, I think using our same scoring mechanism that we use for new hires would be the most legitimate way to evaluate current contributors as well.
