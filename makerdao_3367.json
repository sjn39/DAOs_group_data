Our goal is to release as many of these as we can at the time of MCD launch.

The rules are very simple, use strikethrough for removing obsolete questions, use bold for new additions. Criteria Edits should:  Add useful questions that we may have overlooked Remove questions that are obsolete or questionable Edit the wording of questions to be clearer or more in-line with MCD Rearrange the order of questions to be more logical  Interested?

As long as you keep this things up and make it run to the next horizon, we can do something good. When i say (we) i really want a be part of something. I have to say i am a bit lost since i try to learn code, artificial intelligence, but cryto was a hobby for me to learn new things a while ago. Just buzz me up if anything, but i can translate, and do the FAQs as much i can. I don\u2019t have much time today, maybe tonight, since i have a Hosting event at my appartement on Sunday but i will have some time of course. I really thanks you for all, you and Maker\u2026 it help me to keep my brain alive haha ",
