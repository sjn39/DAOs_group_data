PoC A SIM card with a custom Java SIMgap applet that uses the STK (SIM Tool Kit) menu to ask for user PIN to confirm signature requests Android APP using Android built-in APIs to construct requests to the SIMgap applet iOS APP using BIP (Bearer Independent Protocal) to request the SIMgap applet for performing transactions. Motivation On mobile phones, software wallets are convenient to use but potentially insecure and cumbersome to move to a new device; hardware wallets, while secure, are expensive or requires additional cables or hardware if not unsupported at all. The SIM card seems like a perfect solution: a piece of secure hardware controlled by the user that is always in the phone and can be moved between devices. Next Steps Try for an EIP to define the standard between the SIM and APP. ",

I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying it\u2019s perfect, but it is a nice to have option. it was a bit difficult researching the subject, it also seems that information like IMSI is encoded by the manufacturer and is kept in a database. other information like contacts is readable from the mobile device, so that\u2019s no good. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a trivial way to encode a key securely on a SIM. the other option mentioned here is secure enclaves, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), etc. I wonder if existing wallets already implement this?

Dependencies on the phone manufacturers would involve complications about compatibility, portability and universal certification for security. SIM wallet can be open souce with its applet design, which shares different security domain with other SIM functions by firewalls implemented by javacard framework. SIM can be an \u201copen device wallet\u201d which is compatible with mobile phones, as well as cold wallet and airgap devices which can provide a standard SIM slot. When SIM were introduced in the mobile network while motorola was still dominating the mobile phone supply, the phone devices started to diversify with so many popolar branded manufacturers. We are looking forward to seeing the same advancements in web3 with more hardware wallet suppliers other than Ledger and Trezor for more advances use cases. ",
