Hi community You would have seen the post written by Christian about me. On a personal level I have to say that I was disappointed about the post but I cannot say that I was surprised. I have been an active contributor in this community for a couple of years now and you know that I am not someone to air dirty laundry in public. My focus is and always has been on delivering value to the community and this doesn\u2019 stop today. It is also an open secret that @christiancdpetersen, @Eumenes, @teej and I have different views about what constitutes proper professional conduct and performance. In spite of these differences, I proposed a gentleman\u2019s solution by suggesting they create their own CU and present their own value proposition to the community via the normal MIP39 to MIP41 process. In response to this offer my professionalism and reputation were attacked and I am not going to stay silent. Why you might ask, was I not surprised about Christian\u2019s post? This has been brewing over a couple of months now but over the past week or so I was repeatedly contacted by Teej trying to coerce me into handing him, Eric and Christian a significant percentage of the RWF CUs budget and the facilitatorship. Failure to do so I was repeatedly threatened, would see them proceed with the offboarding process. An isolated incident, you might think? Unfortunately no. I have lost count of the number of times I was contacted by borrowers and counterparties over the last few months informing me about aggressive, rude and sometimes abusive and inflamatory behaviour towards them by members of the team. Why did I not let them go at that time you might ask? The operational risk to the DAO was deemed too high as some key onboarding initiatives were close to being finalised, i.e. SocGen and HVB. I tried to act in the best interest of the DAO by focusing on delivery and closing these projects as soon as possible. During this time the team was micromanaged and delivered the onboardings on time. But surely this is it? See for yourselves and make up your own mind\u2026 I am sharing a small selection with you for starters. Whilst reading, maybe ask yourself:  If you were a Maker Token holder, would you like your protocol to treat its clients like this and do you really think this will attract and retain clients long term? If you were a borrower/ counterparty, would you like to do business with people who insult you? If you were a delegate, would you trust people that insult you? If you were a company or Core Unit facilitator, would you hire contractors that behave aggressively? Would you be comfortable letting aggressive contractors be the face of your business?  In any professional environment, be it a DAO, a corporate, an SME, etc. there are certain standards of civil and respectful interaction that all three have repeatedly disregarded. Letting the team go is not vindication, it is a way of dealing with repeated unacceptable behaviour.

I have shared the deleted screenshots here because they are very critical in understanding what is really happening inside RWF. Members of RWF said horrible and hateful things about Maker\u2019s token holders, delegates, founders, community, and and even Maker\u2019s RWF lenders themselves. The awful disdain that they show for the community in these chats is completely indicative of a Wall Street \u201cbro\u201d culture. Honestly it\u2019s not surprising at all given what we all know about the deceitful world of TradFi that most of us have been trying to escape for years. WIth this type of character on display, what do you really think is going on behind the scenes in these deals? Do you completely trust these humans to be honest, act with integrity and put the DAO first when large financial incentives are placed in front of them to entice cheating? This kind of stuff is the exact reason that I\u2019ve been vocal against RWF in MakerDAO. A new RWF CU will not fix this. This is RWF culture. You can\u2019t extract human nature from humans and you inevitably end up with \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d all over again. A DAO is supposed to be a \u201cdecentralized, autonomous organization\u201d that provides strict rails for humans to ride on. RWF simply does not belong in a DAO due to the fact that it cannot operate on these rails and the fully transparent ethics that they require. You may be thinking\u2026 \u201cWell, I\u2019ve said some nasty stuff in private chats too. They should get a pass.\u201d The difference here is their job. RWF is responsible for operating with integrity in a black box environment, putting together deals with TradFi lenders and (most importantly) acting honestly. Due to the nature of RWF, nobody in this DAO has the kind of incentive that RWF CU has to cheat. This is an existential problem with hosting this kind of activity inside of a leaderless DAO. The unavoidable incentives combined with this small glimpse into human nature should preclude RWF activity entirely. MakerDAO saw RWF as a viable shortcut for survival, but now it\u2019s apparent that it\u2019s a cancer that\u2019s spreading fast. Rational MKR holders, I know you\u2019re out there. It\u2019s time for MakerDAO to close the chapter on RWF before this culture engulfs the entire DAO. We can do so much better than this. Let\u2019s move on from this mistake. It won\u2019t be easy, it will be painful, but these are simply the characteristics of real decentralization. If we don\u2019t take measures to end RWF now, we will lose this DAO to the bankers and regulators within a year. If you are a MKR holder and you want the DAO to begin shifting back towards decentralization and autonomy, then now is the time to rise up. Delegate, vote, and be ready for some hard work ahead. ",

They are embarrassing to MakerDao and establish a precedent that any private communications held by Core Unit Contributors or any community member in their discords or in other private channels are not sacred.   You are drawing your conclusions without having any context surrounding these discussions, in fact I would argue the opposite in some cases, as I suspect some of these discussions are in relation to perceived conflicts of interest the arrangers may have in respect to some of these deals.   I think every community member of MakerDao should abide by some level of professional integrity, and the disclosure of these messages in my eyes violates that integrity.

Maker can\u2019t lock itself in the virtual/crypto/meta world. real value is created in the real world. Maker should learn to build bridges/interfaces to the real world. here I\u2019d like to reiterate my point that there might be one more superfruitful source of organic growth for Maker: tokenising & collateralising Physical Metaverse, like products of digital design and fabrication: a natural middle ground and a bridge between the worlds of purely virtual assets like crypto or gaming and purely real world assets tokenised by entities like arrangers in a trustful manner. This could bring real world assets onchain (although different ones) in a trustless manner without risking decentralisation. incidentally this culture clash could be an excellent test case for metaDAOs: multiple mDAOs with radically different cultures could exist in parallel, compete for clients, maybe some of them will fail, maybe not. without sacrificing Maker core integrity. UPD: just to state the obvious: private correspondence should not be published. ",

The community can decide on the appropriate course of action for those actors. My sole concern if for the execution of our strategies and work around RWAs. As I\u2019ve posted prior, there are a large team of collateral stakeholders involved with onboarding and managing our collateral. This team is highly qualified and we are competent to assess situations and fill gaps. At the moment, the gap is having qualified third parties to do the work. This is manageable and the only drawback is that is might delay the implementation of some of the work in progress. If MakerDAO plans to have RWAs as part of our future, we\u2019ll need a strong group of leaders to put a plan together and manage the messaging and transition of whatever we decide to do as a DAO. Core Units are decentralized but I encourage all of the facilitators and delegates to come together, put a plan in place, then execute. I am willing to participate in this. As I mentioned on several calls, CES has the business acumen and experience to manage whatever \u201ccrisis\u201d may be playing out relating to the onboarding of collateral, crypto native or real world assets. I would ask the community to identify the key areas and focus on solutions around those areas. For me, the following needs to be addressed:  Business continuity RWF actors and actions Clear direction on real world asset work  Please\u2026let\u2019s put the drama and personal attacks aside and get to work on creating solutions and solving problems. Generating revenue for the protocol has to be the #1 priority. Let\u2019s go do that! ",

My issue isn\u2019t just based on how they have carried out their remarks which in itself was beyond disgusting for any organization, but how they also seem to disregard the community, delegates, and the rest of us maker holders in such a toxic manner. Seeing the phrase cockroaches slung so many times really makes me want to see them not be a part of the future of this protocol personally. While I\u2019m sure they did deliver on a few aspects, what kind of precedent are we setting if we allow such cancerous activity to continue in RWF? Did we not learn from the failures of other organizations when you allow such behavior to not only run freely, but for us to encourage it by handing them a new core unit? They should be punished for their actions, not rewarded. This confirmed many of my own personal beliefs as a long time lurker as I awaited the progress on various proposals, and as a maker holder who\u2019s been wanting to see us take on interesting initiatives. This honestly really saddened me to see their behavior since I really wanted to believe otherwise. I think those that are choosing to ignore it are a part of the problem, since it\u2019s beyond clear these individuals have no place at maker. Do we just need to pretend to the holders everything is fine and dandy while meanwhile they shit talk all of us in the background? I would argue since this IS a DAO, transparency is everything since we should see this behavior first hand. Why should they feel like they can move against the interests of the community or set up plans for sabotage for greenlit proposals simply because they don\u2019t agree with them? As a result, I support their terminations after seeing this. I wasn\u2019t sure at first based on their own forum detailed post as to what happened since it seemed shocking. But after reviewing this information, it\u2019s painfully obvious who\u2019s at fault here. ",

What prospective partner of ours in their right mind would post about their bad dealings here? They would get questioned by the community as they would ask for evidence as well. So again, we ask for the evidence - but when we get it, we throw our arms up. If we can\u2019t own what we are, then what is this DAO for? Is the forum just a charade? We are a DAO, DAOs can have problems just like any other org structure, and unless we want to hide it from the maker holders and community, I\u2019m not sure the solution is to brush it under the rug. If another mechanism existed for William to communicate why said individuals were terminated, I\u2019d understand and agree. But at the moment, the forum is what we have, there is no centralized control over this kind of process (I.e HR) and people asking for evidence received it in this thread which I appreciate as a holder. He didn\u2019t like their conduct, he fired them. They then pushed to go around him and open a new CU. Is this the culture we want to foster? It\u2019s straight mutiny That being said, my whole point has been if you had this conduct done in any other organization that has their chats handled via Slack, Teams, Discord etc. it would be flagged and you would be punished. The difference with us is as soon as he terminated them (aka the punishment), we asked why since we are the holders and have the right to know. If he can\u2019t provide the evidence they can paint a different narrative than what reality is. Since Maker is a community owned and driven project, I\u2019d argue that the transparency here is warranted. People should act professionally behind closed doors. There are also ways to professionally vent without calling holders and delegates various names. That just reeks of inexperience. I believe in our protocol, I believe in our community, and I think we can move past this like so many of the other crises in the past. That being said, action was taken and I agree with it ",

There could be better ways to disclose some of this, but it needs to be public given it is about someones \u201cwork\u201d. There is another term I think for this at times, whistleblower. Maker DAO is transitioning back to a corporation from my POV. It is already over 60% backed by USDC, and thus is not decentralized. To me, that makes me question WTF the DAO even exists for. A DAO is about decentralization and operating as a community. You can task certain people as being leaders for X, Y, or Z, but if you are going to try to bring in corporate culture and ideals of what is professionalism, you are going onto a slippery slope to just becoming what you are running away from. A related example is I found that uniswap is asking for 70M USD for 3 years to create a foundation. they are a decentralized trading protocol\u2026 The trend of DAO\u2019s creating legal entities is not always bad, but it can very easily cause centralization and make the DAO null and void. It can also create a point of centralization/failure for goverments/censorship. While that is not the issue in this thread, it is all related to the mentality that to treat what you do in the DAO as a real job, you must act like its a corporation with all the BS culture and politics that can go with it, including having to walk on egg shells with anything you say. Sure you don\u2019t want to act like an ass to anyone, but to do things decentralized, means to do it all openly. And decentralization can create human inefficiencies vs centralized economy of scale, but to be grass roots, you need that decentralization, else there is 0 point in having the DAO at all. This is a POV from a community user of the wider web3/crypto ecosystem. Kudos. ",

Maker DAO is transitioning back to a corporation from my POV. It is already over 60% backed by USDC, and thus is not decentralized. To me, that makes me question WTF the DAO even exists for.   I disagree. The \u2018whistleblower\u2019 was the manager who has used his ability to terminate workers at will. Whistleblowing in organizations is necessary as a safety check to go around hierarchy, when there is hierarchy stopping action. What hierarchy is there to go around when the leaker is the person at the top of the business unit? You do not need to coddle somebody who has accepted a position of responsibility.     williamr:  Why did I not let them go at that time you might ask? The operational risk to the DAO was deemed too high as some key onboarding initiatives were close to being finalised, i.e. SocGen and HVB.   The manager has had plenty of opportunities to witness these comments, react to them or take action privately. Apparently he has decided that business needs justified perceived misbehavior. I also dont agree on this perception but that is another point.     williamr:  Tokenholders did not put me in this position to be loved by the community or to be complacent with misbehaviour.       williamr:  I would have been accused of \u201chearsay\u201d, \u201cmy feelings\u201d, \u201cI think\u201d etc.   I dont understand this thought. If the manager had fired workers and forum posters had accused the manager of being unfair, I dont think the correct response is to leak private conversations. By his own story the manager is not expecting to make friends or be loved with the community. So why sell-out the team to avoid being unpopular? On top of it his last message it sounds like he is threatening to share more. No organization would tolerate something like this. It also does not look like it has worked. My opinion is that  if williamr thought his team was not suitable for him which is fair and can happen, he should have hired a new team. Why didn\u2019t he do this? if he spotted things he thought were wrong behavior he should have tried to stop it. why did he not react to try to stop it? If he thought business was more important than stopping what he thought was wrong behavior, he should have benchmarks for what size of business potential can excuse a particular level of behavior. Could he share those benchmarks? If he feels that he cannot manage an internal dissagreement with his team he should still not have sold out his team like that. What will it say about the quality of new team members if they accept working with the same kind of threat when they get hired? If he feels that he needs constant approval from forum posters to do his job, the forum posters should be the ones doing the job and his position is unnecessary      aburban90:  @Hasu cut the man some slack . This has been a hard time for many of us. The majority of our core contributors are far beyond their breaking points.   People who are not workign for the DAO probably will not see this so clearly. williamr is a business unit manager. if he is not able to meet the demands of managing a business unit team he should not accept to be the bussiness unit manager.

Anonymous public shaming, in addition, resides for me pretty much at the very bottom of the ethical pyramid. If Dante Alighieri would have lived in the 21st century, I am sure he would have reserved a very specific circle for anon public shaming professionals at the very bottom of his inferno. As an incubated facilitator of a Lending Oversight Core Unit - ultimately not voted in, I have been heavily involved with the team over the last many months and have been part of the channel where those conversations happened. I will abstain to comment the portions of the conversations shared because it is absolutely not my style nor professional habit to comment private information that have been shared without consent. Those conversations happened in private chat rooms (not in formal communication channels of the DAO) and, given the context they happened in, I personally didn\u2019t feel the absolute urgency to break respect and professionalism in order to leak them to a broader audience. The facilitator @williamr didn\u2019t feel either at the time. I do not endorse this quality of language, at all, but I am humble enough to recognise my own mistakes and the awkward position I would be in if 100% of my private conversations about business would be leaked in public. Surely, I am not alone. I would like, however, to ask the following questions to @williamr:  Why has the facilitator decided to keep confidential those most severe misbehaviours for several weeks or months?  How has the facilitator felt comfortable in letting those misbehaving actors deal with extremely important counterparties over those many weeks? It is my direct experience (I am sure this can be confirmed by the prospective borrowers as well as other CU members) that the facilitator has rarely participated to those meetings due to personal reasons - his behaviour hardly qualifies as micro-management  Why has the facilitator not opted for sharing those extremely severe allegations in public ahead or contextually to the termination of those individuals? Or, more in general, has there been any structured process to raise->discuss->debate->ossify any remark with the individuals or with the group as a whole?  What is the plan of the facilitator to a) bring to conclusion, and b) continue the monitoring, of those extremely strategic exposures given that no team is currently in place and those individuals (especially our legal advisor @christiancdpetersen) are in possession of exclusive, material, non-public information?  I have numerous inputs to provide about the performance of the CU members (namely @christiancdpetersen, @Eumenes, @teej) as well as the facilitator @williamr. Some of those remarks had been already shared privately with members of the community, including delegates, in due course. They were shared under confidentiality and this confidentiality has been respected. Those people know that the tensions within the CU do not come as a surprise, although the modality those have been shared do. As @Juan mentioned in a separate thread, as part of the incubator\u2019s job description was the drafting of a first audit report for the RWF CU. I have mentioned this before this situation escalated. I am committed to provide this report but, given that I have no MKR official endorsement, my sensitivity about the situation, and the already heated context of the LOVE vote, the report will be shared with @SES-Core-Unit and I will leave them the freedom to do of this information what they please. Those comments represent my opinions solely as a member of the community and do not constitute advice of any type. I would truly appreciate if the community wouldn\u2019t drag me as well into this quarrel. And I am available to reply to any question over one of the next G&R calls. However, I will not reply to any question on this forum as I strongly disagree with the modality of this process. Regards, Luca ",

A great example of exemplry leadership., which raises the question as to who is responsible for accepting an outstanding people leader as yourself to lead a CU with a budget of $7mm dollars \u2026 NOT I would recommend the best course of action is for you to man up and resign, before us MKR token hodlers proceed to offboard you \u2026 why?   You selflessly choose to defend yourself, by publishing private confidential information to justify the firing of employees at the cost of smearing the reputation of the DAO \u2026   You dont provide any evidence that u warned these people through official messaging or email correspondence that they should stop this behavior or u made any attempts to remedy this - for all I know if we saw the complete threads - maybe u were promoting this behaviour? A prof manager/leader/facilitator would have done this \u2026   U dont provide any evidence, except your word - that external parties complained   Seems to me u only fired these people when they questioned ur leadership and chose to ask the community to onboard a new unit due to ur inability to lead and manage the RWF CU.   Seems like as u had no evidence as a professional leader/faciltitor, as u had no better evidence to demonstrate that ur firing is justified - instead u decide to find snippets of private discussions that would justify ur decision - for all we know u photoshopped this information \u2026   The best course of action is for u to be offboarded or save the trouble and RESIGN.   what world are u living in that u think any potential new employees are going to work for a unit u lead ?   lets recognize that the employees u fired would have an easy case to hire and continue RWF notwithstanding ur mudslinging. As everyone knows that they are the people who completed innovative real world deals and not u .   Actually - hoping that they will be smart enough to sue u for defamation ",

As facilitators, we\u2019re really meant to be held to a higher standard of conduct. How I acted, how @williamr handled this\u2026 it\u2019s not professional. Especially for a very front-facing team like business integrations with the \u201creal world.\u201d That said\u2026 I really invite you, or anyone, to try to find talented people insane enough to accept the completely uncharted territories of legal risks associated with being a facilitator. It\u2019s a complete grey zone. A few years down, will some three-letter agency come knocking on our doors?  You have to have at least a few loose screws to take on that kind of role. The RR isn\u2019t exactly there. The \u201cprofessional\u201d candidate you\u2019re looking for\u2026 he/she can go get a 6-7 figure comp in the traditional world, avoid all the risks, and sleep well at night. From my interactions w/ @williamr in the past, he is a great, well-intentioned guy with integrity and competence. That doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse his conduct here, but does it warrant blacklisting him? Personally, no matter how egregious someone\u2019s behavior was, I prefer to give everyone a chance before placing them on the blacklist. Pretty much everyone deserves a chance to reflect on their actions, own what they did, admit where they were wrong, apologize, and course correct for the future. Refusal to admit wrongdoings and own mistakes? On to the blacklist u go! (You\u2019d think it\u2019s a gameable filter, but I\u2019m always surprised to see how many just refuse to accept any kind of blame. Content Production is a prime example.) ",

In all honesty I don\u2019t get the kind of blood lust I see in this thread from time to time. My questions are: How does the CU plan to continue operations with minimum damage to the DAO and its partners? How will all involved handle the strife like adults with a common goal? How will we make sure this doesn\u2019t lead to wider contagion by straining the entire workforce further? I want to look ahead and see a clear path here. What makes an organization great is not the ability to avoid mistakes, but what it does when they inevitably occur. How fast it gets up, dusts itself off and comes back stronger, leaner and with renewed purpose and poise. ",
