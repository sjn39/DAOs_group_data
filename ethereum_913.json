                    "content": "Hey all, it was such a pleasure hosting the Development tooling ring at this year\u2019s Berlin Blockchain week. It has been precisely nine days since we all got together to discuss the Etheruem/Web3 ecosystem and the tooling around it. Before sharing the notes, I\u2019ll try to convey what was the form of the meeting, who came to the meeting, and what we tried to accomplish. Form of the meeting We organized the meeting in such a way that open discussion can happen. We started going in a circle, answering specific questions, but the discussions naturally moved into different directions. First off, we started with the question of how everyone got into Blockchain. After, we continued with what are some of the pain points in the ecosystem. Finally, we did a quick workshop where everyone wrote down on post-it\u2019s what they would like to get improved. Then we went through them one by one and categorized them. Who came to the meeting There were representatives from multiple companies present at the meeting:  OpenZeppelin 0x Nomic Labs Alethio Infura Decenter Status Tenderly Ethereum Foundation  Each of the participants brought professional knowledge, which helped drive the discussions productively. What we tried to accomplish The idea behind this ring meeting was to bring like-minded people into the same room and come up with action items that can be delivered until the next ring meeting. Action items  Learning portal FEM ring standards Debugging info Use the attached table to see who is already tackling the discussed problems  Learning Portal The Learning Portal is something that is needed to onboard new developers and help existing developers be productive. FEM ring standards We thought that the Development Tools Ring could be like a testing ground for possible future EIPs. Debugging info Come up with a \u201ctask force\u201d that can come up with a way to consolidate debugging information from all of the current and future tools, so new debugging tools can be built on top of that foundation. Use the attached table to see who is already tackling the discussed problems Some of the issues mentioned are already addressed in the ecosystem, and we should see how can we enable those teams to be as productive as possible Notes  Hackmd notes FEM Development Tools Ring 2019 sheet  ",
