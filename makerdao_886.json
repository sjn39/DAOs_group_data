                    "content": "Right guys, here\u2019s the thread where we discuss and figure out what we are doing, and when we are doing it. We need to decide the following:  What are we doing? When are we doing it? Are we happy to ignore the regularly scheduled polls this week? Do we want to consider triggering Emergency Shutdown in the short term?  I would like to see as many short-term options suggested and discussed as possible, I will collate these, and will be responding on this thread until we actually decide on something (via forum poll). Once we have the options together, we will start forum polling on what we want to do and what we don\u2019t. It would also be fantastic if someone can do a writeup of the situation that I can include in this initial post so that everyone knows what is going on. At that point, we can take the consensus options and present them to the Foundation for inclusion in an executive. Link to ongoing call - Note that there is a 100 participant limit and we are running into it every now and again.  Summary of the Situation  Courtesy of @silto - Thank you! During the ETH price crash, some Vaults (containing ETH as collateral to mint DAI) became undercollateralized (under 150% collateral). Since the oracle ETH price fed to MakerDAO came under those vault\u2019s collateralization limit, they became available for liquidation. Liquidations are triggered by users calling the contract, which starts an auction for the ETH from the vault. The auctions is used to raise DAI to reimburse the liquidated vault\u2019s debt. In normal operation, user (named \u201ckeepers\u201d) compete for this auction, and the winning bid is paid (in DAI) in exchange for the ETH in the vault. The DAI is then burned, the debt erased, and if some ETH is left, it is returned to the vault\u2019s owner. What happened today is that during the big drop in ETH price, a lot of vaults became available for liquidation, at the same time as the Ethereum network became clogged with lots of transactions, leading to a sharp rise in gas price. This confluence of circumstances led to keepers either stoping their activity for fear of slippage (price dropping fast + transactions taking a long time to validate) and for lack of liquidity to absorb all those liquidations. This lead to a situation where only one keeper continued triggering liquidations, and bidding 0$ for the ETH, with no competition. This situation lasted around 2/3hours, before other keepers came in and resumed normal operation. As a consequence, some vaults where liquidated with 0 DAI coming back in the system, resulting in a net loss for the system. The MakerDAO had a +500k$ surplus before the price drop, and now has a -4M$ surplus that needs to be filled. The protocol covers this issue, the solution being to trigger an MKR mint and auction, the DAI raised being used to fill the surplus debt. During normal operation, MKR is burned when debt from vaults is reimbursed, this would be the opposite mechanism. In order to avoid a 0$ bid from winning a liquidation auction (which was possible because of a short auction timeout - 10mins -, the biggest bid wins the auction if no other bid covers it) the Maker team is currently discussing the possible solutions.  Summary of the Call  Helpfully provided by @ryanberckmans    Media should email [email\u00a0protected]  An emergency shutdown (not happening now) would cause DAI holders to take a haircut, whereas the social contract of MakerDAO is that MKR tokens take a haircut in the event of system failure. Therefore we should try and ensure that MKR holders take a hair cut by avoiding emergency shutdown if possible. I heard that emergency shutdown is  not  being considered as an immediate option. MKR buyers should prepare for a large MKR system auction in < 48 hours. If this is successful it will pay back the current $-4M surplus. For altruistic whales who want to help, the current best way to \u201cdonate\u201d to this issue is to bid on the upcoming MKR system auctions. MKR buyers should consider buying MKR on open market to support the underlying MKR price. (down 44% in last 24h) ETH buyers should consider running a keeper bot to buy liquidated collateral and help prevent this issue from happening again. https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper  The simplest root cause here (unconfirmed) is that a lack of keeper bot competition contributed to ETH collateral being sold for $0, possibly because of high gas prices and eth node sync issues, and many keepers run their own eth nodes. In the next 24 hours, we must work on ways to make it easy for anyone who can afford it to participate in the MKR system auctions. We won\u2019t want to constrain the set of auction buyers to those who can afford it  and  have the technical ability. In @ryanberckmans opinion, keepers and MKR buyers should prepare for sustained high gas prices, and downward pressure on ETH and MKR. The Dow Jones hit sell-off circuit breakers three times in the past week and a half. It\u2019s a historic week. We should plan for global markets to potentially crash further which may correlate with further crypto drops.   Current Issues 1. Dai is off-peg. 2. FLOP Auctions will occur concurrently, we may want to attempt to mitigate this. 3. There is ~4 million worth of bad debt in the system currently.  Suggested Options 1. Increase the FLIP auction lot size  Pro: Decreases the load on the ethereum network. Pro: Easier to track instead of 1000 liquidations at once. Pro: Lower transaction fees per unit collateral makes it more worthwhile to take part. Con: Prevents keepers with lower levels of capital from participating in auctions.      Yes No     0 voters      2. Reduce the FLIP auction lot size  Pro: Allows keepers with lower levels of capital to participate in auctions. Con: Increases the load on the ethereum network.      Yes No     0 voters      3. Reduce the DSR  Pro: Brings more Dai in circulation, hopefully moving the Dai price closer to the peg.      Yes No     0 voters      4. Reduce the Global Stability Fee  Pro: Encourages more CDPs to be opened for arbitrage on the price of Dai, hopefully moving Dai closer to the peg.      Yes No     0 voters      5. Create an out-of-order executive to pass the chosen changes as soon as possible  Pro: Faster response. Con: Breaks the known schedule, possibly confusing MKR Holders.      Yes No     0 voters      6. Ignore the current set of polls in order to do emergency response procedures.  Pro: Faster response. Con: Breaks previous precedents around process.      Yes No     0 voters      7. Increase the initial bid price for the collateral auctions.  Pro: Resolves zero bid-size issue. Con: Requires a technical change to the smart contracts, might not be immediately available.      Yes No     0 voters      8. Increase the minimum bid time.  Pro: Gives more time for keepers to bid on each auction. Con: Increases market risk for keepers.      Yes No     0 voters      8. Make the minimum bid time dependent on the spread between the bid and the oracle price.  Pro: Gives more time for keepers to bid on each auction if the bid is currently low. Con: Increases the market risk for keepers as they no longer know for sure how long the bid will last.      Yes No     0 voters      9. Increase the debt buffer before the MKR mint auctions happen.  Pro: Prevents MKR from being auctioned to recover from the bad debt. Con: Prevents MKR from being auctioned to recover from the bad debt, this breaks the implicit promise that MKR will be used to recapitalize the system.  Edit: Turns out this isn\u2019t as simple as changing a parameter, probably not feasible in the short-term but I will leave the poll up. Second Edit: Turns out this is possible by increasing the debt buffer to greater than the current level of debt.     Yes No     0 voters      10. Decrease the MCD ETH-A debt ceiling to 110million and the MCD global debt ceiling proportionally. (From Cyrus)  Pro: Reduces the severity of the OSM attack.      Yes No     0 voters      ",

By making this time proportional, with a minimal limit, the risk would still be low for people bidding close to the current oracle price, and the ability to get the ETH at 0$ would be reduced. with ETHUSD = 100$ (it\u2019s an example to simplify % calculations, don\u2019t panic) 100 - 80$ bids (under 20% spread) -> 10 min 79 - 50$ (under 50% spread) -> 1h 49 - 25$ (under 75% spread) ->  5h <25$ (up to 100% spread) -> 24h  if we are going to have a 4M$ MKR auction:  It may be better to put a very simple UI for people to participate and provide liquidity.

Therefore we should try and ensure that MKR holders take a hair cut by avoiding emergency shutdown if possible. I heard that emergency shutdown is not being considered as an immediate option.   MKR buyers should prepare for a large MKR system auction in < 48 hours. If this is successful it will pay back the current $-4M surplus.   For altruistic whales who want to help, the current best way to \u201cdonate\u201d to this issue is to bid on the upcoming MKR system auctions.   MKR buyers should consider buying MKR on open market to support the underlying MKR price. (down 44% in last 24h)   ETH buyers should consider running a keeper bot to buy liquidated collateral and help prevent this issue from happening again.  https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper   The simplest root cause here (unconfirmed) is that a lack of keeper bot competition contributed to ETH collateral being sold for $0, possibly because of high gas prices and eth node sync issues, and many keepers run their own eth nodes.   In the next 24 hours, we must work on ways to make it easy for anyone who can afford it to participate in the MKR system auctions. We won\u2019t want to constrain the set of auction buyers to those who can afford it and have the technical ability.   In my opinion, keepers and MKR buyers should prepare for sustained high gas prices, and downward pressure on ETH and MKR. The Dow Jones hit sell-off circuit breakers three times in the past week and a half. It\u2019s a historic week. We should plan for global markets to potentially crash further which may correlate with further crypto drops.   ",

It would be be pretty easy to Dockerize, but from what I\u2019ve seen in the repo the auction-keeper code doesn\u2019t actually determine the bid, it manages a model that determines the bid and you have to create that model. Your model is just a process, and it feeds auction events into your model / process, and then your model / process responds with bids if it wants to Do you know if there are open source models? I think the other complication is you have to connect it to an Ethereum node. Does anyone know if the auction keep will run against something like Infura?

                    "content": "Announcing MakerDAO Keeper Pool working group During today\u2019s Community Call (5 hours and still ongoing at the time of this writing), multiple members of the Maker community stressed importance of increasing # of Keepers servicing the MCD system in order to prevent yet another collapse of the Auction Market (aka Keepers market) as it happened today. Why did the Collateral Auction market collapse? Why did Keepers stop operating? Unfortunately, most Keepers stopped operating this morning due to the following reasons: Root cause #1: Catastrophic liquidity crunch. Keepers simply ran out of DAI to bid in the collateral: 1.a I believe some Keepers were unable to continue Keeper operations due to inability to liquidate ETH fast enough for DAI. 1.b Some Keepers shut down due to squeeze (bought ETH for 170 DAI, and hours later can only sell for 130 DAI at a loss - which is way more than 13% liquidation penalty). Root cause #2: Network congestion. This brought many Keepers to its knees. Even with liquidity, many were unable participating in auctions due to stuck transactions & high gas costs. In addition, issues like longer client sync times + some Ethereum clients (like Parity) sufferring from known problems of keeping transactions stuck in Mempool for a very, very long time, amplified this problem. POSSIBLE SOLUTION - MakerDAO Keeper Pool. To prevent more people from losing their funds, I decided to fund development of a MakerDAO Keeper Pool and provide an interim grant to Atomica and Protofire teams to kick-start the effort.  Mission of this initiative is simple - allow anybody to become a Keeper and participate in liquidations of collateral and earn 13% liquidation penalty, competing with existing Keepers. Expected outcome #1: Improved maturity of the Collateral Auctions (competitive Keepers market). Expected outcome #2: Increased the collective liquidity used by Keeper\u2019s to fund liquidations. Who is behind this effort? Core team is made of 1) Engineering team from Protofire (developers of mkrgov.science) 2) Engineering & risk teams at Atomica (developers Atomica.org/unwind) 3) Members of Maker community who reached out to me with interest to provide feedback, contribute to the upcoming Keeper node client, test the pool and/or provide liquidity to the pool. Together, we promise to ship one or more of the following ASAP: 1. Web-based MakerDAO Keeper. Perform liquidations of 3rd party collateral from your browser as a Keeper. Earn 13% liquidation penalty. 2. Open Source Keeper Templates. Run your own Keeper Bot on AWS - 1-click Installer for a MakerDAO Keeper Bot (open source Amazon Machine Image). 3. Non-custodial MakerDAO Keeper Pool. Earn yield on DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai from a pool running multiple Keeper bots servicing MakerDAO ecosystem. Join/Exit/Add/Withdraw DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai, and earn 100% of liquidation penalties earned by the Keeper (zero fee pool). If we get your support (in the form of participation), we aim to: - Upgrade the MakerDAO Keeper Pool to be a Keeper of Last Resort. Think of a Keeper backed by on-chain, guaranteed liquidity AND configured to participate in auctions with bids of at least 0.85 of the current ETH-DAI market price, as reported by oracles. So long as the Keeper Pool is operating, no Keeper will be able to take advantage of the system and cause yet another collapse of the MakerDAO Collateral Auction markets. - Ship 3rd party JavaScript / npm library + Android/iOS SDKs to embed Web-based Keeper or MakerDAO Keeper Pool join/exit/add/withdraw liquidity into your own dApp, protocol, product or service. If anyone is interested in joining this community effort ( for example by a) providing feedback/ideas/ccode contributions, or b) running their own Keeper using hardened AWS AMI template, or c) by providing liquidity (DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai) to a Keeper Pool) - feel free to join our working group to ship and use the MakerDAO Keeper Pool ASAP - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfekQcjT5up5Uh2W_C2W0U5zJ5miLd5ott_87CW8-dDH75TZg/viewform ",

                    "content": "Governance Plan and Forum Response Recap  The market experienced a severe downturn, ~30% over 24 hours. Gas issues complicated matters by making it difficult for vault owners and other ecosystem actors to interact with the protocol. Like with previous market events, Infura/node issues further complicated people\u2019s abilities to interact with their vaults, keepers and oracles(?) A large exchange halted withdrawals due to gas prices This resulted in individual vaults becoming undercollateralized and having the balance of their Dai debt sent to the \u201cbad debt\u201d pool. This ate through the $500k surplus buffer, before triggering another $4.5million of liquidations. In the rush to pay down dai debt the peg destabilized. Of primary concern are the events surrounding the Keeper ecosystem:  Keeper activity, already historically very low, did not provide adequate coverage during collateral auctions. It appears that one or more keepers, in the absence of any competition, placed lowball orders for collateral    Solution It is the Foundation Risk Teams recommendation that the following parameters be added to the executive vote this Friday.  As per the existing winning polls:  Sai Stability Fee: 9.5% => 7.5% Dai stability Fee: 8% => 4% (applies to ETH and BAT) Dai Saving Rates Spread = 0  Therefore DSR of 8% => 4%   GSM for SCD is getting activated Migration contract debt ceiling: 30M => 10M SCD debt ceiling: 30M => 25M MCD Eth debt ceiling: 150M => 110M Global MCD debt ceiling: 125M Additional parameters: Flip auction TTL: 10 minutes => 3 hours Flip auction lot size: 50 ETH => 500 ETH Flip auction maximum duration: 3 days => 1 day Flop auction TTL: 10 minutes => 3 hours    The change in the TTL for the flip and flop auction parameters are designed to give keepers any additional time needed to overcome network issues such as the ones seen this morning. The increase in lot size will also lower the amount of auctions (and, thus, transactions) that will need to take place. A significantly lengthened TTL means that the auctions are likely to reach the maximum duration. A lower maximum duration would help counteract long auctions. These options will allow the community to reduce the impact of an additional market downturn while it has the opportunity to continue to debate further, more refined solutions, in the coming weeks. EDIT / ADDENDUM: All, due to the highly evolving nature of the situation, we\u2019re proposing some changes to the above parameters.  The GSM for SCD is no longer part of the spell. It creates too many edge cases unknowns and puts SCD at considerable risk. The Flip and Flop auction TTLs are both being increased to 6 hours. We are aware that there are some volatility issues due to the long lockup, but right now the priority is that it\u2019s difficult to sync up nodes at all. We should consider erring on the side of node safety. There will be a Debt Auction Delay being included for 6.5 days. This is for a variety fo reasons. First, in the current situation we probably shouldn\u2019t complicate our situation with additional debt auction worries. Additionally, this gives any prospective investors time to collect their ducks in a row to make a strong bid for MKR on Wednesday midday (as opposed to the current Saturday morning at 4am for west coast time).  EDIT / ADDENDUM 2:  Flip Tau is will be reduced to 6 hours. Having the Tau be higher than the Ttl just adds significant overhead to monitoring the auctions. With ttl = tau, they will be significantly easier to process.  EDIT / ADDENDUM 3:  MCD Eth debt ceiling being reduced to 100M instead of 110M in order to target a ~20 M buffer.  ",

With a longer TTL you will need to be able to access a lot more keeper capital. Other options, which probably aren\u2019t immediately available.

They would rather see a bond issue.  Which may be a better way to raise DAI capital from the DSR markets than just letting it fly away by lowering the current DSR. The problem with this is that the deposit withdrawal mechanics would have to be different because you want the DAI deposited there to have a term (say 2 years).   Offer a tasty FIXED rate of return (say 6-8%) over 2 years and then pay back the loan out of the SF fees over the next 2 years and/or sell MKR depending. Actually the more I think about it the DAI DSR-2 deposit contract could literally not allow people to withdrawal until a specific date and the interest would accumulate as per normal DSR operation.   I am just not sure how to implement such a beast into the system BTW:   The problem here is DAI pricing risk which depositors may not be hot to deal with.   Perhaps USDC deposits could be considered.   Either way bond issues (debt) are typically how companies attempt to raise cash vs. dilution but both are valid financial tools used by companies. ",

Maybe a double of everything  50-100, time from 10min to 30min vs. 500ETH and hours or a day until a working keeper pool can be set up and operational.   Then at least we will know the size of our liquidity provider of last resort. I also would like to see the SCD DC go to $20M vs. 25M   Everything else looks perfect. ",

                    "content": "@MakerMan got it. Thank you for the valuable feedback, and handling many questions from the community this afternoon on the Maker Community Call! Would love to meet you one day in person! Once we plug the leaks by  a) introducing improvements to the Collateral Auctions b) onboarding more Keepers, lets figure out how MakerDAO could emerge from the crisis stronger than we were just a week ago. Moving forward, lessons we all learned today are highly important when it comes to considering new collateral applications to MCD. Specifically, I would like to bring forward four recommendations: 1. Encourage low LTVs for new collaterals during early days of such collaterals in MCD - Even when collateral value is not as volatile. Where does this recommendation come from? During the last 9 months I had an opportunity to prototype risk model, calculate stability fee, LTV, debt ceiling (as an independent risk team) in pilots of a new collateral candidate (accounts receivables aka invoices). We were successful at originating real-world loans to trucking companies using DAI using their invoices as collateral (privately sourced DAI deployed to trucking companies who pledged off-chain collateral and borrowed DAI from a legal entity, just without MCD). Based on this experience in finding a product/market fit for MCD in traditional capital markets, I believe we should encourage new collaterals not to attempt replacing most commong legacy financial lending products (which often have very high LTVs). Instead, we should encourage new collateral applications (most of which are in the originating business) - to focus on a \u201clow LTV product-market fit\u201d - a niche in the respective lending markets where borrowers are comfortable pledging said collateral and borrow DAI from MCD at MUCH lower LTV ( such as home lines of credit - i.e. 50% to 70%) and not lending products with high LTV (such as mortgage loans at 80% or 95% LTV). Example #1: Accounts payable collaterals (invoices of businesses). These guys will argue that 90% LTV IS safe because invoice factoring companies offer 98% LTV (they buy invoices outright). We must argue and encourage such applications to find a niche in the market where borrowers are OK to borrow at 50% LTV. Example #2: Real estate collateral - we must encourage collaterals to find borrowers who want a \u201cline of credit\u201d type of product (who are OK with low LTV product) instead of a \u201cmortgage\u201d type of borrowers (these folks expect 85% or even 95% LTV product). 2. Define what a \u201cMinimum Viable Keepers\u201d market should be before we allow them into MCD. For example, make sure new collaterals have at least 3-5 Keepers specializing in, and native to this collateral (for example Keepers who understand the collateral, or enough \u201coff-chain auction\u201d participants collection agencies specializing in buying invoices, 3. Conservative debt ceiling allocations. Start with small debt ceiling, and only increase debt ceiling with growth of # of Keepers and history of participation in auctions. 4. Custom Auction Parameters for each collateral. Adjust parameters through governance based on risk/size/liquidity. Think custom Collateral Auction parameters for each collateral (for example: 4.1 liquidation penalty of 10% for real estate, 15% for account receivables, 20% for BAT, 25% for RenBTC 4.2 Consider activation of collateral-specific lot size 4.3 Consider activation of collateral-specific delays 4.4 Consider activation of DYNAMIC liquidation penalty. Liquidation penalty does not have to be static. It could be adjusted according to the risk this LTV and this collateral brings to the MCD system. For example, we can tie liquidation penalty to a bonding curve LTV (for example 50% LTV for collateral X = 10% liquidation penalty, 70$ LTV for the same collateral X = 20% liquidation penalty). I hope that community considers recommendations above with the goal to reduce probability of Collateral Auction collapses in the future. ",

The increase in lot size will also lower the amount of auctions (and, thus, transactions) that will need to take place. A significantly lengthened TTL means that the auctions are likely to reach the maximum duration. A lower maximum duration would help counteract long auctions.   I think most of the OP is great. The one potential issue with just lengthening the TTL is I\u2019m not sure it will entirely solve the problem. You may not end up with 0 bids (which is great) but if you look at typical user auction behaviour, people tend to wait until near the end of the auction to place their actual bid. The issue here will be the same, the user with the fastest bids will win and may in fact enable anyone that colludes with a miner to be able to \u201cout-bid\u201d competitors as disproportionate amount of time by prioritizing certain transactions. Maybe I\u2019m too far in the weeds here, but this thought popped into my head while reading the blog post. The other thing that I think is a major issue that doesn\u2019t seem to be addressed is how the pricing oracle was able to be so far off the other market rates such that an individual was essentially able to front-run the on-chain activity. Any thoughts on improvement there? I\u2019m not sure how that price feed is created. ",

However, I can still see some issues that should be addressed:   Make it clear to CDP owners that the liquidation penalty can be as high as 33%. And that it\u2019s most likely considerably higher than 13% during a crash like yesterday.   Increase the Surplus Buffer: If the value of the collateral falls more than 33% during the 6 hours, the debt will increase, even if keepers pay close to market rates. Also, it is likely that bids will only happen in the last few minutes of the auction: Maybe a -25% bid 10min before auction end with some keepers trying to get a bid in at -5% in the last seconds of the auction. If the gas price spikes, the -25% could end up winning, further increasing the debt.   ",

So dai auctions as per my understanding work in 2 phases the tend phase and the dent. First there is the kick phase this is where auction participants keep offering dai for the lot being auctioned. This will continue until the bid >= something called the tab. Tab is the amount of dai we are hoping to receive in that auction. Once the tab is covered the auction moves into the dent phase. In this phase participants compete by stating the smallest lot that they would accept for the amount of dai being offered. My impression/understanding is that the auction just never entered the dent phase (i.e reverse auction) because the was not enough dai bid to cover the tab. I guess it is important to note that covering the tab is in no way guaranteed and it is a perfectly valid outcome for an auction to end without ever reaching the dent phase. ",

                    "content": "Unfortunately as Centrifuge, there is very little we can do in the short term to alleviate the issues of last week, and I support bringing on USDC as collateral as a short term solution. In the long term though, I think adding non crypto-correlated assets is one of the biggest opportunities to address these issues for good:  New assets will ease pressure on the Dai price in conditions where ETH is crashing due to a supply of Dai that isn\u2019t necessarily being liquidated. New assets can bring additional liquidity to keepers and others when Dai liquidity is limited because of large market movements We\u2019ve surpassed the safe debt ceiling for ETH at the current price of ETH. The debt ceiling for ETH was lowered to 110M Dai and might need to go down more. This sets a limit on how much Dai adoption can grow without adding new collateral or ETH raising in price.  Adding assets that are uncorrelated doesn\u2019t just ensure that the value of Dai isn\u2019t linked to a single asset type, it can also help stabilize the price of Dai supply in times of high ETH volatility. I agree in some points with what @Renat said above and I\u2019m looking forward to discussing the new Collateral Onboarding Process (v1) to speed things up. Let\u2019s pull together and work on bringing assets on board coming out of this with a stronger system.

                    "content": "I have a couple immediate thoughts and a couple more long term thoughts: Short term: Doesn\u2019t the massive change to TTL cause potential issues with regards to competitive (with respect to fair value) bidding.  Keepers were effectively selling a 10 minute option, now there are selling a 6 hour option, which will have much more value and cause less competitive bids.  This likely fixed the potential for system debt, but increases the chance of effective larger liquidation penalties for CDP holders. 500ETH seems like it may have problematic effects.  It will reduce transactions and auctions, but reduce the amount of keepers who can participate. A lot of the zero bids could be due to a lack of DAI borrow across platforms (dydx and compound were above 100% utitilization for much of the day).  Pooled liquidation platforms could alleviate this.  A potential attack vector without keepers holding DAI would be taking up all of the borrow for a short period of time (10mins to 6hrs, based on TTL) and bidding on auctions. Long term: A minimum DAI bid for the auction is not a trivial problem.  Some ideas:   Start at 100% of DAI debt and reverse auction based on % of collateral.  If that fails, move to an auction for less than 100% of DAI debt, and then a reverse auction for collateral.  This likely fixes the DAI debt problem assuming one person can get a bid through, though it can still cause a liquidation penalty of 50%.   Minimum DAI debt bid based on realized vol in the asset and the oracle price.  If realized vol is low and the CDP is at 149.9%, its likely the minimum DAI bid can be much higher vs a 125% collateralized CDP and realized vol being much higher.   ",
