Based on the conclusions drawn in this proposal Proposal for the avoidance of possible future sanctions  it seems that the best decision so far is not to regulate Dai to avoid any future penalties, but to reduce or directly remove Dai\u2019s exposure to USDC regardless of whether that means that over $3,061,726,764 in vaults will be closed and over 2,173,826,002 of Dai going out of circulation is a tough and difficult decision as this would take a large part of the revenue away from the Maker protocol should it succeed in removing all that USDC backing, or one could simply proceed by taking less extreme measures such as raising the interest rate on those vaults as much as a high-risk asset.

We should diversify from USDC by increasing exposure to other assets. Some PSM options include, other stablecoins, tokenized real world assets, synthetix real world assets and for crypto vaults we can create incentives (reduced SF, referrals, etc) to grow vault balances. With the recent news, we should expect MKR to speed up its diversification from USDC and to grow its surplus buffer but taking this action without counter initiatives would lead to DAI\u2019s death spiral ",
