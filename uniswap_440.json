                    "content": "Uniswap Discord Server Support Situation As many of you know, the Uniswap Discord server receives a lot of questions from end-users.  Prior to the UNI launch, the developers answered these questions but it was a huge drain on expensive developer resources, and there tended to be a large delay between a user asking for support and the user getting an answer due to time zones or the development team just trying to get work done. Since the UNI launch, the Uniswap Discord server has become overrun with support inquiries and the Uniswap development team has almost entirely stopped answering questions, likely because they are overwhelmed with them.  A number of community members have taken up the call and answer questions when they can, but their response time is still unreliable and their availability is limited.  Surprise: most of the questions in Uniswap Discord server over the last month have been answered by my team, disguised as helpful community members!  Serveth Support A few weeks prior the UNI launch I coincidentally started training a team of support representatives to address the general problem of Ethereum dapps needing 24/7 support by people who understand at least the basics of Ethereum.  Across all dapps, the most common questions are the same such as \u201cwhy is my transaction pending?\u201d, \u201cwhy did I pay ETH for a failed transaction?\u201d and \u201cwhat is a gas price?\u201d.  My goal with this business is to provide answers to that class of question, and triage/troubleshooting for more application specific types of questions.  We also want to ensure that dapp users receive a prompt response from a human, even if their final answer may be delayed. Prior to the UNI launch, I had been using the Uniswap Discord server for training as the volume of questions in there was good for training and the class of questions was particularly representative of generic Ethereum questions.  Around the time the UNI launch happened the first of my trainees were to the point where they could start answering some basic questions so I threw them to the wolves and had them help out with the UNI launch craziness and we started training the next batch.  Since then, I have grown the team to 5 people, who are now scheduled across all days of the week and all hours of the day (with some breaks for lunch scattered about). Pricing Complexities My original plan was to complete training and then propose that the Uniswap dev team hire my team.  However, with the surprise launch of UNI, I thought that perhaps the new UNI community fund would be a better source of funding for this sort of endeavor as it seems to naturally align with community building and decentralized financing. My tentative pricing plan was going to be 500 USD (paid in crypto) per month, plus 3 USD per customer helped, plus 0.04 USD per message read.  The reason for these is as follows:  The 500 USD minimum ensures that the team can dedicate enough time learning the basics of the product being supported and maintaining that knowledge as long as the client continues to pay. The 3 USD per question is pretty industry standard for highly technical support services (which Ethereum support qualifies as).  Also, it ensures that we\u2019ll be able to fully cover costs in the event that there are more questions then we have staff for and gives us some room for growth (to hire more people to answer questions). The 0.04 USD per message read ensures that we can cover costs and grow in the event that a chat server we are supporting receives a massive volume of chatter that the support representatives have to sift through (finding questions in a high volume server can be time consuming).  The problem with this pricing scheme is that it will result in a monthly bill that varies greatly per month, and so the client hiring our business for support services would review an invoice each month, pay what is due, and then we would start tracking the following month.  With Uniswap governance, it would be quite unreasonable to submit a new governance proposal every month with the previous month\u2019s bill! On top of that, UNI governance doesn\u2019t actually have any assets besides UNI, which is a highly volatile cryptocurrency with an uncertain future.  Finally, authoring Governance proposals is challenging and expensive in its own right, and anything that involves price oracles suddenly becomes much more complicated. For this reason, I propose having the pricing plan for Uniswap be a bit different.  Instead of charging monthly per message/question and denominating in USD, I propose that instead UNI governance sets up a drip of UNI as payment via something like Sablier, which governance could cancel if necessary. Proposal For the reasons outlined above, and in order to mitigate risks for my business (UNI price risk and over-utilization risk) I would like to propose a Sablier UNI stream of 35,000 UNI over 365 days. For this fee, Serveth Support (https://serv.eth or https://serveth.support, website not live yet) would provide 24/7 coverage of all channels in the Uniswap Discord server except the foreign language channels and the development channels.  We would provide answers to basic questions and triage and escalation services for more advanced questions.  We would be available for almost all hours of the year, with exceptions for lunch breaks throughout the day and occasional unexpected service outages (e.g., power outages, death/dismemberment of a team member, etc.) Proposal Creation If there is sufficient interest in this proposal, I can draft the actual Solidity contract for it.  I do not have the 10M UNI necessary to launch such a proposal though, and will wait until I hear whether there is general support before dedicating time to writing the code (writing the contract code alone probably costs a substantial portion of the proposed amount!)

                    "content": "    UniT:  How would Serv.eth report to Uniswap governance; what would those reports contain?   The tentative plan for traditional clients was to just track (e.g., in a public Google Sheet or something) the questions answered by the support staff, each with a Discord link to the conversation.  This would allow anyone to spot-check/audit the questions and answers if desired.  That being said, that was more intended for the per-question billing model rather than the flat-rate billing model. I think for the flat-rate billing model it would be more just \u201clook at Uniswap Discord server to get a feel for whether Serv.eth Support is doing their job or not\u201d.  Since governance can cancel the drip payment at any time, someone would merely need to raise a concern here to get it discussed.     UniT:  How would success be measured?   Users receive a prompt reply to almost all questions at all hours of the day.  Either the question is answered directly by the support staff, or troubleshooting steps are followed and data is gathered for escalation to someone more capable at answering (e.g., me or dev team) for answer at a later time.     UniT:  Any reason to not use live chat on the Uniswap front end as the primary channel?   This would require quite a bit of engineering to do.  We want to be very careful of any support happening in private channels as it opens the doors to scams.  While I trust my support team, I don\u2019t think UNI holders should have to trust my support team.  Building out a toolset that allows for auditing of private support queries is a pretty large task and definitely out of scope for this proposal.     UniT:  Personal preference to see any payment made in USD stablecoin rather than UNI to help governance budget more effectively.   I believe this would first require UNI governance to somehow acquire USD, which is a very non-trivial operation.  While I would not be opposed to payment denominated in USD, I worry that getting to a place where that is possible is a long way off. ",

I think for the flat-rate billing model it would be more just \u201clook at Uniswap Discord server to get a feel for whether Serv.eth Support is doing their job or not\u201d.  For this I feel someone from Serv.eth should at least consolidate some key bits of data for each calendar month:  Number of requests Requests resolved User feedback (support staff dealt with, satisfaction out of 10 + any comments)  This would help provide some basic ability to measure activity/success and can be elaborated over time.

While I would not be opposed to payment denominated in USD, I worry that getting to a place where that is possible is a long way off.  I\u2019m not familiar with how the treasury is being managed (multi-sig?). I would personally opt that the treasury allocates UNI to Compound and borrows stables to pay for services like this (separate discussion for sure). It would be ~ interest rate neutral and would drastically lower the risk of exchange rate volatility of UNI without needing to sell UNI. ",

                    "content": "    Naught:  Bots/fake accounts manipulating volume of messages answered (3 USD per) and read (.04 cents per message).   This would certainly be a concern for a client paying per message.  In this case though, the payment would be flat-rate so not a concern for this proposal.     Naught:  35,000 Uni Locked in for the year and variable pricing (is serv.eth asking for 105k usd for the year? Or expecting prices to go up to x value and is asking for 400k usd?) At what point does it become overpaying if prices go up x amount?   The agreement would be that we\u2019ll work for a year for 35,000 UNI, regardless of the price movement.  If the price tanks, we\u2019ll still fulfill the year contract.  If the price moons, you\u2019ll still pay us the agreed amount.  The reason for the asking amount is largely because we are not in the business of trading/speculating, but the only current option for payment is in a volatile currency.  If the price stays where it is at or increases, then 35k will be very favorable to my business.  If the price declines some, I\u2019ll still break even on cost (assuming support load remains somewhat consistent).  If the price tanks, my business will be running at a loss but we\u2019ll continue to provide support for the year because reputation is very important in these sorts of things, and I don\u2019t want to be seen as a business that goes back on its contracts. If the payment was in USDC or DAI or some other coin that is less likely to be volatile (even ETH!) then I think the asking price (at today\u2019s valuation) would be significantly lower.  Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t currently an option, and Uniswap Discord server is in need of support today (not in 6-9 months after governance figures out how to get a hold of some other currencies).  Once my team\u2019s training is complete I\u2019ll be pulling them out to give full attention to paying clients, which means there will be a support hole left in the Uniswap Discord server that I\u2019m not certain the current volunteers will be able to fill (but maybe they can!).     Naught:  It sounds like many of the same questions are asked from users asking for help. I.e. where is my transaction? Is this a scam token? Can I get my funds back from sending to x address? Would you say a majority of these kinds of questions could be answered via a frequently asked questions page?   Certainly!  The problem is that users don\u2019t read FAQs.    As an example, look at the number of people who pop into the Discord server to ask where their money went and the answer is \u201cyou were scammed\u201d.  All of these people would have not lost money if they had just taken some time to do some basic research before using Uniswap.  Same with the common questions, the answer to all of them already exists on the internet often times even just 1 line up in the Discord chat log, yet the user\u2019s still come in to ask for help.     Naught:  If a user is using a more ux friendly wallet, such as dharma or argent etc. Then will your services be only targeting a specific segment of the uniswap community I.e. direct uniswap users who also use discord?   Discord is listed in the Uniswap UI and all over uniswap.org as the place to chat about Uniswap.  I believe it is the primary place where Uniswap users go to get assistance, which is why I propose we hang out there.  We will do our best to assist anyone who uses Uniswap, regardless of the specific tools they are using, though I will be open and say that our expertise focus is definitely on MetaMask wallet users as they are by far the dominant wallet that users requesting support are using.  Over the last month, I believe we have assisted people with hardware wallets, Argent, Coinbase wallet, Portis, Fortmatic and I suspect others. ",

Will there be a break down of how much of this 35k UNI is going to your self and how much to your workers? I.e. 15k founder? 5k per current staff?

Whereas, one could hire an internal team for $5k / month if not less than that. And, I\u2019m talking 24/7 quality coverage there, not community moderators that copy + paste an FAQ. On top of that, I\u2019ve recommended the Uniswap team to create a Telegram channel. I\u2019m aware there would be a lot of \u2018spam\u2019 in the Telegram channel. To combat this and ease the load of moderators, the following actions could be taken:  Create a full custom Telegram bot that detects/removes spam (e.g. advertising, scams, airdrops, etc.) This bot would also offer captcha option for new users, as well as automatically trigger (with a time-out) to answer certain standard questions.  The pinned message of the Telegram channel would be the basics of Uniswap + links to the most frequently asked questions. I\u2019d expect hundreds of users asking questions on a daily basis & thousands of messages, most of which would be easily answered through an FAQ. Look at the big giants, live customer support for a (decentralized) platform of this scale is (almost) impossible. And therefore, things should be \u2018automated\u2019. Moderators would refer more difficult technical questions/issues to the Discord and help keep quality in the channels, rather than answer every single basic question. It would be the most effective use of money. Typically I would always recommend a full 24/7 support team, but I just don\u2019t see it happening here, especially because of anticipated spam & the same questions being asked over and over again. That being said, would recommend setting up a FAQ page on Uniswap with links to dedicated pages answering these questions with examples + screenshots. It would answer 90% of the expected questions. I\u2019d be happy to help the team with this.  Why Telegram and Discord? Many users use Telegram > Discord. Technical questions & Governance questions could be forwarded to Discord to prevent spam there. Telegram could cover basic questions via FAQ + Bot + some moderating. Why fixed fee > custom fee. As I mentioned pricing here in my opinion doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Why automatization > customization here? Uniswap community and questions will most likely be too big to tackle, 90% could be answered through FAQ + Automization and 10% could be custom answers. Goal here is not necessarily to build a community, there is already a huge one and it has proven itself. Aka, it\u2019s a decentralized community that is already moving forward.  ",

Therefore, add a FAQ + automate 90% of the support on Telegram. Other than that, redirect users to Discord for the more advanced questions. See Telegram as a first \u2018spam\u2019 filter there, main purpose there is FAQ. Discord would be the real deal, which is where you can go into in-depth conversations and quality support in the dedicated channels: Support, General, Governance, etc. - The Discord would be much more manageable, but TG should not be underestimated  Though even on Discord I doubt 24/7 paid support at scale would be the right decision, as there\u2019s a lot of volunteers that help out as well as community members.

The level of support you get with that is usually \u201cTier 1\u201d which means they can answer questions like \u201cHow much does product X cost?\u201d and \u201cWhat are shipping fees?\u201d and \u201cDo you ship to X location?\u201d and \u201cDoes it come in Red?\u201d.  What Serv.eth Support offers is closer to Tier 3 support, which means our staff understands the systems being used well enough to troubleshoot problems and gather technical support information required for effective escalations. Something to keep in mind is that running a business often costs more than just the flat hourly rate of employees.  Whether $3 is too high or not is certainly a subjective question and the answer is complex.  I won\u2019t assert that I am certain the pricing is correct.  I will say though that it is not a get rich quick scheme for me at that rate.   If someone can provide equal/better service for a lower price I definitely encourage them to submit a competing proposal!  I created this business because I saw a dire need for basic Ethereum technical support across the ecosystem that was not being filled by anyone else.  I would love it if someone filled that void, and it doesn\u2019t have to be me.   ",

                    "content": "    Naught:  The flat rate charge of 35,000 UNI for a year, will there be a breakdown of how these funds will be distributed? As we saw with the ICO bubble it was a winner take all at the top. I assume you will be receiving a large potion of the 35k as founder of serv.eth, and creator of the future site smart contracts. Will there be a break down of how much of this 35k UNI is going to your self and how much to your workers? I.e. 15k founder? 5k per current staff? I am in support that the distributions should be more favored to equality of payment between workers and founder vs what is seen in current token launching models.   The plan would be to periodically (e.g., once or twice a month) withdraw the dripped UNI and immediately exchange it for USDC, DAI, or ETH and use that to pay employees their agreed upon salary.  After that, excess funds go to covering other costs that enable employees to be more productive/happy/comfortable such as equipment needs (e.g., office supplies, workstation, desk, chair, etc.)  If there is money leftover it would go toward growing the business, either through acquisition of new clients, hiring of new employees, training, marketing, sales, etc. To be clear, Serv.eth Support is a private business that isn\u2019t directly affiliated with Uniswap.  It is a service provider that I propose Uniswap governance could hire to complete a specific task.  The reason for accepting UNI as payment is solely because UNI governance does not have easy access to stable coins at the moment and I didn\u2019t want to complicate the proposal with mechanisms for converting UNI to stable coin. I generally am pretty open about how I plan to run the business, but there are limits.  I won\u2019t share my employee\u2019s salary publicly for example, because that information is private to them and it is their choice whether to share it or not, not mine.  I do not plan on taking a salary for myself any time soon, as I\u2019m more interested in growing the business than growing my personal bank account at the moment (I have enough personal runway to go without a salary for a while).

                    "content": "TL;DR: In-app chat support is a good idea, but it comes with a bunch of costs and complications that make it not a great idea right now. It would certainly be cool to have support integrated more tightly into the UI, perhaps with an in-browser chat pop-up or something.  There are a couple problems with this:  My team specializes in support, not engineering, and building a solution like that requires engineering work.  While this is something that one could build, governance would need to hire someone other than my team.  Also it is worth noting that engineering is way more expensive than support, so keep in mind that the cost for such a thing would likely not be trivial. Governance doesn\u2019t actually have any say over the v2 UI other than where the uniswap.eth ENS record points (but not uniswap.org).  This means that while UNI governance could fund the development of such a tool, it is entirely up to the Uniswap dev team (which is not beholden to UNI token holders) to integrate it into the official UI and they may choose not to for any reason. Discord support is public, and that was an intentional choice with my team.  Support representatives are in a unique position to be able to scam users (\u201cplease give me your recovery words so I can fix your problem for you\u201d) and we already see this scam very frequently.  The easiest way to combat this is to make sure all support is done in public channels rather than private channels.  Another option would be to have a very robust auditing system in place that allows one to do live remote audits of support work that is happening, but this costs significantly more because you both need to build the auditing tools and hire staff to actually do the auditing. My company is still small and just starting and we do not have the staff or engineering expertise to build/operate such a thing at the moment.  Even if we did, it would still increase the cost of our service significantly due to the additional staffing requirements.  ",

Holder\u2019s/governance participants, attract new holders/LPer\u2019s, more importantly find a way to build it in to the user economics of the protocol (i.e how can the fees be used to attract users to Uniswap for its utility). It is in the best interest of all token holders to attract users outside of the tech savvy.  The best group to target with the fee\u2019s would be users who are from countries where a little goes a long way, perhaps we give away first year of fee\u2019s to those who need it most, from area\u2019s that need it most.   Treasury should be used for building on top of Uniswap, and helping developers build out current applications for new capabilities. I think transparency is key, i.e.  deliverable A receives UNI payment B.   1 and 2 solves 3. If we have more users, and new functionalities from developers then volume on Uniswap protocol increases. The increase in volumes will help drive those holding on CEX\u2019s to come to Uniswap to partake in liquidity pool\u2019s. Also if you are a new user receiving fee\u2019s then you will be less likely to put tokens on  CEX, being introduced to uniswap first that user is less likely to use an inferior product (i.e. CEX\u2019s). Those users may also be unable to retrieve fee\u2019s if its on a custodial account, unless that application builds capabilities to retrieve it easily.   Attacks will be prevented the more the token is distributed. Uni holders would not be aligned to bite the hand that gives fee\u2019s.   I am not against paid uniswap chat support. I feel it fits a criteria of: Deliverable A (chat support), should receive Uni Payment B. On the larger scale chat support as a whole can be seen what is being evaluated, is the job being done well? Are observers in the Uniswap ecosystem seeing the value provided on a daily basis (Uniswap help discord)? I think the job is being done well, do I think it is worth 35k UNI for the year, not sure. I would say 35k UNI is a good value for UNI holders if going towards 10 employee\u2019s. I would say 35k UNI is not a good value for UNI holders if going to 2 employee\u2019s. I state the above as it needs to satisfy point 1 and 4, we need to evaluate distribution and what is good for uniswap users. Is the quality of service good with 2 people or is it better with 10? Should the 35k be structured into a Uniswap application where users submit quick chat concerns with bounty reward for answering from this 35k UNI (i.e. issue is presented from a user, a responder can then provide guidance, if user is happy with answer then responder receives payment from 35k). How can a chat support be opened up to anyone rather than a few responders (i.e. 10 employees)? Also building an application where this chat support is structured as a micro service cover Point 2, building on top of Uniswap and providing new functionalities (i.e. building a chat support DAPP, rather than using a central service like discord). I think we need to have a high standard as to what passes with governance, such as :product/code up front, payment approved by UNI holders once value is put on table to evaluate. ",

If we were an HR department of a company that looks to get the most for its resources\u2019 frugal spending, a lot of the logic above would be applicable. The critical metric would be the number of \u2018happy customers\u2019 we \u2018buy\u2019 with 1$ spent on chat support service. In my opinion, there is a bigger picture to consider. When we reward teams and individuals who bring value to Uniswap, using the most precise market rates might not be the right approach. Uniswap treasury is far from being short on funds, so I can\u2019t find a good argument to be frugal. Even when we significantly overpay contributors for their work, it still is likely the best avenue of spending governance treasury in terms of ROI. The way we reward contributions sends an important signal to future contributors.   Higher rewards bring more contributors . Higher rewards raise the cap of the quality of incoming contributions.  Let\u2019s consider two scenarios.   we reward contributors with perfect market rates   we reward contributors with 2x market rates   Imagine we reward 1 million UNI for 1 million UNI worth of work over a year in the first scenario. In the second scenario, we would reward 10 million UNI for 5 million UNI worth of work. In my opinion, the second scenario is much more beneficial for the growth of Uniswap. If we want more people to bring value to Uniswap, the rewarding process needs to be: a) easy b) generous. == Regarding the proposal at hand, the suggested rates are close enough to market rates that I don\u2019t think there is a need for discussion on lowering them. Lowering the rates would send an uninviting signal to future Uniswap contributors. == Regarding the proposal\u2019s scale, I think it would be better if the second layer of Uniswap governance would decide on and execute it. The scheme where 40 million UNI tokens need to vote for a 35k grant looks disproportionate to me. ",

                    "content": "TL;DR: The contract asking price is $50,000 / year.  The premium required for paying in UNI is 2x.  Serv.eth Support is a support company, not an investment firm, and taking on the risk of high volatility assets is not part of our core business model.  Something I would like to clarify.  The asking price for this contract is 50,000 USD per year.  If governance had the facilities in place to pay in DAI or USDC, then the contract would be for 50,000 DAI or 50,000 USDC dripped over the course of the year.  However, at the moment Uniswap governance does not have the facilities in place to pay with a stable coin, it only has the facilities to pay with UNI. Serv.eth Support is not in the investment/speculation business and while we are willing to accept UNI as payment in this case, the premium for doing so is pretty high.  This is to minimize volatility risk we take on.  In just the last two months we have UNI price fluctuate between almost $8 and below $2, which is a 4x range.  This may be good for an investment firm that trades in high volatility assets, but it isn\u2019t good for a traditional business venture that has costs to cover. My commitment is that regardless of whether the price of UNI in USD goes up or down, my company will continue providing support for a year.  This means I\u2019m taking on risk of the revenue from a contract with Uniswap becoming worthless (e.g., if UNI drops below a dollar), which is why I am asking for essentially a 2x premium. It is also worth noting that in the consensus check vote I put up I also mentioned that at any time Uniswap governance could switch the drip over from UNI to DAI/USDC.  This means that if Uniswap governance gained the ability to pay in stable coin 6 months from now, a vote could be proposed that stopped the UNI drip and started a DAI/USDC drip without any break in the support services provided.  This means that I don\u2019t fully benefit from the upside of UNI, since presumably if UNI does moon there would be significant incentive for governance to \u201cfigure out how to switch over to DAI/USDC\u201d, while if UNI tanks then there would be little incentive to stop paying in UNI.

This is an actual business that I started whose mission is to provide chat support to Ethereum applications such as Uniswap.  We are also reaching out to other potential clients at the same time, not only Uniswap.     uni2:  When people were shilling the recent UNI dump on the UNI discord and others defended UNI with clear arguments of volume and DEFI nature the Discord UNI moderators chose not to ban people many of whom were clearly using baseless FUD tactics to feed the dump.   Again, for clarity, the proposal here is to provide support services, not moderation services.  While moderation services are something we can do as an add-on service if desired, it would mostly be for dealing with obvious scams, spam, etc. and not with curating discussion topics. I happen to be a moderator in the Discord server right now, though that is unrelated to my support business.  My policy on moderation is generally to only deal with the obvious bad actors like scams and spam, and any curation that isn\u2019t someone openly breaking a rule I tend to escalate to the server owners to deal with.     uni2:  DApp functional button to allow UNI holder to gift UNI to people who they identify are helping the spirit of DEFI.

Ideally it would be a team formed from a more randomly drawn distribution of community UNI \u201cvolunteers\u201d weighted across the Discord language channels most widely spoken and in need of DEFI.  As you claim publicly you already have your team trained. I contend it would be preferable to raise/train the team organically via interaction in all the discord UNI language channels, not via what seems a more commercial venture. I would heavily discourage voting or delegating votes to this cause. It is premature and goes against the spirit of organic decentralization and the building-up of community. The 400 tokens airdropped and dump, coincides with the high influx of discord members and questions as did the UNI dump shilling, that was rampant in the discord with some current mods unwilling to take a stand against including baseless FUD against UNI. Personally the building-up of knowledge in more organic  and decentralized albeit chaotic way of asking, reading, watching, I think, a small price to pay for the 400 UNI tokens and will be more sustainable in the long run to the DEFI community.

The issue in the case of a core support team who is first mover receiving a lucrative contract (35k UNI), does not allow others to simply enter the support providing market. The barrier to entry for a first level discord support group is very very low. The barrier is raised when a contract is given to a small group, I would also say this disincentives others from giving that service for free while a group get paid. An open and decentralized chat support platform does not exist that allows outside entrants to disrupt the initial support discord group (and allow price discovery of this service to emerge). I think my main issue is that it is being paid in UNI (and is being asked at a premium) and the rate is not flexible based on a demand for services/competition of new entrants since it is going to a central team.
