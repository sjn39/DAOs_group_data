The resulting artwork (and time lapse Reddit Place (/r/place) - FULL 72h (90fps) TIMELAPSE - YouTube) was both stunning and an insightful look at social cooperation on the internet. I think it would be extremely interesting to create a pixel art canvas that utilizes quadratic voting to determine pixel color and in which the 90% of funds used in voting are directed to Gitcoin\u2019s treasury to fund grants, and 10% go to the creators. The artwork could ultimately be listed as well and sold for the same purposes. I haven\u2019t made an official proposal yet, because I\u2019m interested in getting feedback on this idea. Let me know as well if this is something you might be interested in contributing to. ",
