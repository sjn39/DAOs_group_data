                    "content": " The Ecosystem Performance Dashboard Objective   TL;DR  The Ecosystem Performance Dashboard is a tool that aims to:   Increase transparency by allowing for ease of comparison across timeframes and highlighting work performed and delivered output  Increase accountability by making the data provided by Core Units more accessible and easily understandable  Reduce information costs by collating scattered information into more consumer-friendly formats  The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that MakerDAO SES is working on will feature information pertaining to:  Core Units:  Basic information (Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Roles, CU Social Media Presence, etc) MIPS information (39/40/41 specifically) Budgetary (Budget/Actuals over time) Roadmap (Milestones, delivered outputs and stakeholders involved)   High-level ecosystem info (Developer activity, FTE count)   Context As the DAO is growing both in size and complexity, MakerDAO SES has placed a focus on projects to increase the level of transparency and quality control. We believe that this is key to successfully enable the efficient allocation of resources across MakerDAO\u2019s moats of workforce, work and capital. Ultimately, this will ensure the successful longevity of the project.  Prior Work  2032\u00d7676 164 KB  Part of the objective is to unite various efforts MakerDAO SES conducted in 2021 such as:   Project X-Ray (analyzing the onboarding funnel of developers in the ecosystem) The DAI Core Unit Capital Flow mapping The creation of a Budget Transparency and Automation tool Development of DAO Capital Auditing Processes  These efforts have gone some way to standardizing information (Budget Tool) and helping with quality control (Auditing Processes). Bringing things forward to 2022, we are now working on the creation of an Ecosystem Performance Dashboard to collate these initiatives as well as increase general transparency and ease of access to information across the DAO.  Need for Performance Dashboard MakerDAO SES believes the need for an Ecosystem performance API and dashboard is threefold:  Increase transparency by allowing for ease of comparison across timeframes and highlighting work performed and delivered output Increase accountability by making the data provided by Core Units more accessible and easily understandable Reduce information costs by collating scattered information into more consumer-friendly formats  In turn, these improvements will help to ensure sustainable and successful scaling of the DAO.  Benefits of an API-first approach To ensure that the work performed has the most impact and remains useful over time, the decision has been made to approach this goal with an API-first approach. This means that we are designing in the first place an API that is useful in its own right, and approach the dashboard User Interface (UI) as a second step. The API-first approach will:  Allow data providers to automate the collection and submission of live data. Increase usability by allowing application builders to freely access this data and include it in their products. Enable long-term, full-automation of DAO operations. Allow MakerDAO SES to work asynchronously with the 3rd party UI developers.   Phase 1: Stakeholder Research Interviews The first step involved reaching out to the stakeholders of the project to ensure the desired output was based on actual use cases. The stakeholders we spoke to were divided into two categories:   Mainly data consumers  Mainly data contributors  We interviewed a total of 10 stakeholders made up of 5 contributors (Core Units) and 5 consumers (Delegates and Core Units). The objective was to identify the current problems of both groups, as well as their desired outcomes as it relates to data and information within the DAO. As a result of this research, we were able to uncover 8 core problems for data consumers and 2 core problems that data contributors have with data and information in the DAO today.  2014\u00d71064 275 KB   2016\u00d7604 103 KB   2020\u00d7502 59.7 KB  Ultimately, we are aiming to create a dashboard that will aid both data consumers and data contributors to reach their individual goals and desired outcomes. To achieve this, we will focus on catering to 5 desired outcomes for data consumers and 3 desired outcomes for data contributors.  2010\u00d71104 298 KB   2012\u00d7246 22.8 KB   2014\u00d7906 109 KB  This research was then narrowed down into a hierarchy of informational needs, encompassed broadly under the 4 pillars shown below. These pillars were made up of a number of specific metrics which we incorporated into the planning of the data model that will make the foundation of the API and dashboard.  2174\u00d71054 322 KB  We have taken this Stakeholder Research, synthesized the results into actionable items, and included this insight in the next phase of the objective.  Phase 2: Data Model Design  Conceptual design First, we created a conceptual data model to present the model in a way that is close to the way end users will perceive the data. The diagram below illustrates this conceptual design, showcasing how we assume a user may navigate through the Ecosystem Dashboard. Each colored block represents a group of data, from which an in-depth Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created with the specific attributes relating to each group. This was once we ensured that we had all the major data categories for an MVP design of the database. The design was used throughout the stakeholder interviews to introduce the idea of the Performance Dashboard and API.  1270\u00d71238 102 KB   Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) The ERD shows a more granular level of the data model and builds the foundation for the creation of the underlying database. This diagram will also be used to help craft the API definition to assess how best to package the data requests for users interacting with the API such as the UI developers and other interested builders and 3rd parties. The data model assumes usage of a wide range of current sources of data (such as the MIP portal API), as well as new sources such as a new Budget Reporting Tool currently under development by MakerDAO SES. Thanks to the API-first approach, platforms and tools can be integrated with the Ecosystem Performance database, increasingly automating more work.  5340\u00d74171 1010 KB   Next Steps  1794\u00d7912 89.4 KB  The next steps in this process will be:  Implementing the database using the ERD as a starting point Creating the GraphQL API definition and documentation Working with the 3rd party developers on the design and creation of the dashboard  We look forward to bringing the MVP to the community for feedback!

Gaming industry and tools used by Korean Kpop like Vlive/Weverse) and the status of decentralized run projects/CUs (e.g. Jira, Workzone)? Before deciding which agile decentralized project mgt methodology (e.g. Scrum, Kanban) should be used in MakerDAO we probably will first need to design a more efficient and collaborative way of working cross CUs from an execution perspective as well because the current haphazard structure of siloed CUs doing their own thing is not scalable. Duplications/inefficiencies will need to be addressed and accountabilities for what type of outcomes will have to be agreed upon. ",

                    "content": "@ElProgreso All of the above mentioned tools come in multiple languages including English and are meant for cross country collaboration and/or engagement. There is no point recommending regional specific tools to a globally dispersed DAO eco-system. As for the mentioned agile project tracking tools they are being used by Google, Spotify, Airbnb (and I hear rumors that crypto.com may be using it as well) just to name a few. These companies use scalable, agile, decentralized models for execution based on self-managed Squads/Chapters which is also how the project execution in a DAO can be set up. As for the community engagement tracking tools you need to check with gaming companies that have a long tradition of managing big player communities (some are doing this already for 15+ years) to understand what the best tools are there. And like I mentioned the fan-community platform tools that Kpop is using to communicate with their global fanbase may be worthwhile looking into as well coz its much nicer compared to shattered communication over discord/youtube/live streaming platforms etc. Vlive (Naver - best tech) /Weverse (Big Hit) merged last year and would be interesting to have someone looking into their merged platform to see if this could be of use for better engaging the MakerDAO MKR community as well. They seem ambitious and may be eager to partner from their side with MakerDAO as well. ",

                    "content": "Hey @v18n_asia, Thanks for leaving some thoughtful comments! Our Ecosystem Performance API and Dashboard aims to cover a wide range of data around the performance and health of the DAO. MKR community engagement is not currently a proposed inclusion within the MVP, as you rightly point out this would likely be covered by existing solutions in Maker such as SourceCred. One of the main aspects of the DAO structure Maker now operates under is the autonomy with which the Core Units are given to operate on their specific mandates. This extends to the project management methodology and accompanying tools any Core Unit chooses to operate with as they are entrusted with these types of decisions by Maker Governance to operate most efficiently on their roadmaps. Bringing this back to the Ecosystem Performance API and Dashboard, we feel an in-house API first approach is the best way to tackle some of the information problems that our stakeholders are facing. Specifically due to the unique and uncharted territory that Maker operates within. @Haiku covered the results of our stakeholder research in this status update. We talked about the proposed solutions for these problems. He also lays out who the stakeholders are for this API and Dashboard which may give some further clarity on the proposed solution we are working on. Ready-made tools such as the ones you have proposed are likely useful for the individual Core Unit level (we use Notions Kanban platform in @SES-Core-Unit) but when looking to analyze the performance of the DAO as a whole, it would require all Core Units to agree to use the same software and management techniques which strays somewhat from the autonomous nature. Instead, SES is working alongside other Core Units such as @strat-fin-core-unit to implement standardized formats for data around Roadmaps and Budgets to allow for more ease of consumption for Data Consumers. By collating this data in an easy-to-consume format, it is our goal to reduce the effect of siloed work (by making cross DAO communication easier) and in turn, reduce inefficiencies while increasing the level of accountability (by reducing information costs for data consumers) in the DAO.
