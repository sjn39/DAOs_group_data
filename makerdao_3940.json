We don\u2019t even have half a million of headroom left, so we should act now.  Pros:  more DAI in circulation maybe even removes USDC from the PSM more DAI/USDC liquidity on uniV2   Cons:  as this is a 0% stability fee ilk we are not making any more money with this move  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     50 MM (no change) 100 MM (+50 MM) 150 MM (+100 MM) 250 MM (+200 MM) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-07-30T13:00:00Z; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

It can function as a small relief on the PSM (which has seen very minor outflows this week) while still maintaining peg via similar arbitrage mechanisms at the core. We forgo the modest 10 bps of revenue from the PSM and acquire an extra layer of risk from the LP intermediation, but it also gives us a collateral we can liquidate without messing with the peg.

It\u2019s only now becoming clear that the added liquidity in this pool is causing the APY for fees collected to drop drastically.  The reason this is a problem is that this pool is 50x leverage (each round of leverage requiring 4 transactions) for a total of 200 transactions.  This means it costs gas, a lot of gas.  Even if one uses a flash loan to spin this up, the slippage on the trades in this range amount to a significant loss.  In both cases, the participants in this Vault need to stay in this vault long enough to offset the losses of spinning up/down for it to be profitable.  At the current APY, this pool is beyond that profitability.  It would take many years to make these costs back with the APY.  Adding more liquidity is not bringing more traffic to the pool in large enough numbers to offset this APY drop. One can see the daily updated APY numbers here:   apy.vision    APY Vision - Manage your DeFi liquidity pools in one easy dashboard Track impermanent losses with the ultimate liquidity pool analytics tool, with yield farming and vaults      Pay particular attention to the 7D/14D average.  As time goes by since this was levered up, the APY has dropped drastically, and trapped these Vault holders at a loss (until that APY increases). ",
