From OS point of view, this Core Unit is a level up, retaining most of our core mandate, but giving it more structure and strategy. The biggest change will be that SES will continue to incubate a selected, limited number of Core Units (we have been covering all), and will not cover DAO-wide operational support in a traditional sense (such as DAO resource accounting and reporting). Below are the list of OS initiatives in the works and details on status in the merger. Juan and I will continue to support these projects as Operational Support to its completion. We also recognize there\u2019s a period of time where SES will not be officially mandated (til June), therefore we also took this into consideration in covering projects during the transition period. Current Supported Projects (Support til ~June)     Lead Project Status     Both > Juan Weekly updates in G&R Will be given by Juan   Juan MKR Compensation: 1) Juan will help the Working Group to the first stage: getting Reps, set up with first meeting, then checking in on the progress. 2) Both of us are getting sentiments from Core Units in RFC, Public Draft, Approved on how they want to move forward with incentives/MKR while the overarching framework is being defined. Bootstrap & Handoff. Not actively in scope for SES   Amy > Juan Grants Foundation Grants has sunset. While it doesn\u2019t cover a traditional \u201cDAO Grants Program\u201d per se, a form will exist in SES as \u201csponsorships\u201d   Amy Project Compass, the framework for gathering and setting DAO vision. Will continue to contribute to the framework. SES is working on a framework for core units defining their vision/mission.   Juan MIPs Portal Next version complete. Will hand-off to Governance   Amy Sourcing talent & incubation. This has been quite small scale (like Autonomous MakerDAO and grants) and not an official initiative. SES  will cover a part of this through the Sponsorship and Incubation Programs    Core Unit Support (Most will merge to SES) Most of the work we\u2019ve been doing to help core units at early stages will continue to SES, but in a more formalized incubator model: Will continue to SES in limited scope or handed off as research  Helping review & give feedback on core unit proposal drafts Develop resources and tooling Supporting teams interested in support / incubation Reminders for process and timeframe Multisig Accounting & Invoicing Resources DAO Operations Comparison Research Legal framework, resources, and core unit with @layerzero  (Did not start) Core Unit Reporting  Not actively in near-term scope for SES  DAO Core Unit Costs & People Overview  Feel free to reach out if you have questions or concerns!

The amount of new core units being proposed has slowed down. We\u2019ve completed \u201cWave 1\u201d with teams receiving budget. We\u2019re at \u201cWave 2\u201d - with the second group, giving us a total of 7 core units. \u201cWave 3\u201d is coming into Formal Submission with 2 core units. We\u2019ve observed core units carving their own spaces, even different ways of work / principles being challenged. Observations & Questions that have been brought up:  What happens when one core unit\u2019s principles are different than another? What kinds of conflicts are coming up? How are they resolved? When and for what is a good time to consider standardizing / striving for consistency? (Notably budget reporting has come up) Should core units be allowed to nurture a treasury using requested budget?
