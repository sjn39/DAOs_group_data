There are some helpful Maker sources around, particularly at makerburn.com (ft. fun charts) and https://docs.makerdao.com/. Re: your questions about DAI, you might like these posts from @Artem_Gordon about DAI, namely: State of DAI | June 7 - 13, 2022 That post has some great info about how the existing DAI supply has been generated (these numbers will have changed in the last week, though, as a small caveat):  image1380\u00d7884 62.8 KB  ",

                    "content": "The answer is pretty simple\u2026sometimes people might just want to hold DAI over USDC. Ask yourself\u2026why do people hold USDC and not just keep things in USD?  Currently the USDC market cap is 56B as opposed to the 6.8B DAI has.  So USDC is obviously still more desired but just as there are applications that holding USDC over USD enables (maybe as simple as trading different crypto assets), there are applications that DAI can be used for and there are overlaps between the two coins.  So at the end of the day it just comes down to trust (risk) and reward.  Some stablecoins out there yield 30%\u2026but they\u2019re not trusted.  DAI is a very trusted coin in the defi space.  But you don\u2019t really get much for holding it right now.  But say the DSR was set to the treasury rate and DAI holders could passively get part of treasury bond returns just by holding DAI?  Well, I would bet some of that USDC that returns nothing would flow to DAI.  Maybe some USD too!  But it\u2019s all a competition because nothing prevents USDC from offering that rate as well. So how else could we differentiate DAI without compromising its safety or MKR\u2019s solvency?  That\u2019s the trillion dollar question we try to answer every day. ",
