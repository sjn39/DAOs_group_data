Incidents overview for September 2022 As usual, starting with the overview over the incidents that were opened and we\u2019ve been working on in September. They are split on per service basis:  AWS infrastructure - 21 incidents EC2 instances - 71 incidents Etherscan - 1 incident Governance App - 2 incidents MongoDB - 7 incidents Nodes - 15 incidents On-Chain Governance - 9 incidents Oracles and Feeds - 22 incidents Vulcanize DB - 2 incidents  TOTAL 150 incidents All incidents are handled by the team with a 24/7/365 on-call schedule covering all time zones. Internal Community tickets This is a reminder that TechOps Core Unit has a channel on MakerDAO Discord server (#techops-requests) that is dedicated to Community, where anyone can open requests. 12 tickets were opened using that method. The Merge The biggest Ethereum event of September was The Merge. We were preparing for it a couple of months before it happened. There was a Discord channel created to coordinate all activities between core units related to the Merge. TechOps core unit team has been closely monitoring all the infrastructure. Overall everything went fine. We had to do a couple of last minute changes and node upgrades the day the Merge happened and resolve small infrastructure issues.

Summary This thread is updated weekly to include the most recent and relevant Core Unit and Team updates covering the work done for July 2022. A similar thread that covers Core Unit and Team work done for August 2022 is available here.  Last month, nearly all Core Units posted an update on their work and progress. We also broke a record regarding the total number of updates posted within a month. These metrics help represent the transparency and communication each Core Unit provides for the DAO.  1219\u00d7500 2.93 KB  The graph above compares the number of active Core Units (yellow), Core Unit updates (purple), and updates that fall within Core Unit mandates and domains but are not necessarily posted as Core Unit updates (teal). Since January 2022, the number of monthly updates has approximately doubled. Core Units are not only providing monthly updates on their work and progress, but some are also doing so on a weekly cadence. In addition, Core Units continue to organize their initiatives and subteams, which leads to a greater number of Other Updates, such as RWAs, Brand, Governance, Finance, and other initiatives-based updates. I\u2019m excited to see the final numbers for July 2022.

                    "content": "TechOps Core Unit was formed in the beginning of February after an executive vote passed. I would like to give an update of what we have been working on during the first month of operation. Want to remind that the Core Unit\u2019s main focus is ensuring Maker\u2019s critical infrastructure and ecosystem stability and operability. We continue to monitor over 200 different parts of the system, parameters, servers, market deviations, etc. In February the team received alerts that can be grouped into these services:   AWS infrastructure - 6 incidents  Blog - 1 incident  Coinmarketcap integration - 1 incident  EC2 - 7 incidents  Etherscan integration - 2 incidents  Marketing Website - 2 incidents  MongoDB - 12 incidents  Nodes - 3 incidents  On-Chain Governance - 10 incidents  Oracles and Feeds - 9 incidents  Poke Keeper - 2 incidents  Test templates - 3 incidents  TFI - 1 incident  Vulcanize DB - 7 incidents  67 incidents in total. All incidents are taken care of instantly or close to instantly (depending on their priority) and the necessary actions are taken in order to fix the root causes. Sometimes these actions require cross Core Unit collaboration. Independent work  We successfully migrated all the tools and services from the Maker Foundation accounts to the new TechOps Core Unit accounts and are now exclusively using our Core Unit budget to control, pay and monitor all the tools necessary for operations. We are constantly monitoring and optimising our AWS cloud costs. In the past month we researched and implemented a Compute Savings Plan and converted all of our storage volumes from GP2 to a newer, more robust and cost efficient GP3 format. Ongoing work regarding setting up a new entity to efficiently work with a DAO. This includes sourcing quality legal, accounting and human resources. We are continuing to work with SES CU mainly around their budget reporting framework. You can see our monthly Budget Statements.  Collaboration with the Community  We have done necessary updates to Discord slash commands. If you didn\u2019t know, anyone can use Discord slash commands to get some useful information. Just type / in the message field and you will be prompted a list of possible commands. Discord user ban bot has been updated and some settings have been improved Forum has been upgraded to the latest version and some extra plugins added. Besides that we try to perform daily updates to have the latest security fixes deployed in Production. Notifications about MKR liquidity and On-Chain Governance Hat updates have been implemented and added to #bot-feed Discord channel available to all Community.  Cross-Core Unit collaboration  Together with Gov Alpha CU helping with onboarding new Core Unit members to all internal systems. Build notification system for the Dai Foundation Core Unit informing about GitHub changes Build online parser of assets that belong to the Dai Foundation Together with Governance Communication and Immunify Core Units working on onboarding more teams/CUs to the internal alerting system. For Protocol Engineering Core Unit created 2 Dockerfiles for running the UI and logger.py with Docker, a docker-compose.yml to run these locally for testing, and deployed these 2 chainlog components in AWS.  Work in progress There are some tasks in progress that we are working on and want to share of what you can expect soon:  During our CU launch Pod Session we\u2019ve been asked about our CU roadmap and plans. We are working on creating a roadmap, formalising it and making it available to all Community. We plan to convert some internal notifications about ecosystem parameters to become public and available to the Community. Improving public Maker ecosystem statuspage, integrating and automating it with internal monitoring system.  Let me know if there are any questions to the above. ",

We\u2019re still giving top priority to Maker\u2019s critical infrastructure, as well as ecosystem stability and operability. Below you can read our March 2022 updates. New hires Our core unit team is growing and we are happy to welcome two new hires:  Artautas who is our new project manager and is already helping us structure the processes, finances and structure our work better in terms of defining priorities. Nick is our new DevOps engineer. And we are very excited to have him. Nick is already helping us with several engineering projects. More to come.  Expanding the team is always great. That means we can deliver more, do it faster and better. Incidents overview for March 2022 TechOps core unit is always on-call. Team members are distributed over the globe. We\u2019re online 24/7 with no holidays and breaks, looking after the Maker Ecosystem. Below is the list of the incidents that were triggered during March 2022 split into services:  AWS infrastructure - 34 incidents Blog - 3 incidents Governance App - 5 incidents EC2 - 6 incidents Etherscan - 4 incidents MongoDB - 4 incidents On-Chain Governance - 16 incidents Oracles and Feeds - 12 incidents Poke Keeper - 2 incidents Vulcanize DB - 12 incidents  TOTAL - 98 incidents You might wonder why there are so many AWS Infrastructure incidents that we receive. The answer is simple. Most of the infrastructure that many projects are based on is marked with this name and goes under AWS infrastructure incidents. If we dig more, there were multiple projects\u2019 infrastructure that had issues. But nothing to worry about, TechOps took care of everything. Community work We created several things that affect the Community. In case you missed them, they are:  We have a new Discord bot deployed to MakerDAO Official Discord server that blocks specific username patterns that tend to be used to trick and mislead our Community users. Hopefully that reduces the amount of spam and protects our Community more. A new channel called forum-notifications has been created on MakerDAO Official Discord server. We configured it in a way that all new topics created on Forum generate a notification that is sent to that channel. This is to create awareness about new things that are being discussed on Forum. Let us know what you think! Ownership of some specific plugins that are used on our Community Forum has been transferred to TechOps. Now we are responsible for deploying, updating and maintaining them. The same technical work that we are already doing with the Forum. Many support requests to onboard/offboard people, give access rights, create accounts, help with forum and other tools, check permissions, help with calendars, provide some information from random documents or systems, upgrade accounts, etc.  Technical work   MakerDAO legacy APIs (Vulcanize DB) - we planned to decommission old MakerDAO APIs and verified where it is used. Since we discovered that it is still used in a couple of critical places, we decided to continue maintaining and supporting it. We will continue looking for some permanent solutions for replacing it.   We upgraded geth nodes that we currently support to the latest versions and also prepared for The Merge.   Did update MakerDAO Statuspage, linked all its parts to automated tests that we are running. That means the fails in monitoring tests will automatically update status on that page. A separate forum topic about that update will be created soon.   Optimized AWS costs by moving some legacy projects out of the account that we are maintaining.   Provisioned two L2 infrastructure nodes - Optimism and Arbitrum in preparation for L2.   Finances  We completed our first month of operations budget reporting. Second month of operations - March is available now too.  Collaboration with other teams  Dai Foundation Core Unit - helping with the flow for managing all Dai Foundation assets, a process for requesting updates, getting approvals, etc. Growth Core Unit - helping the team with getting some analytics data. PE CU - continuing to work on provisioning L2 nodes and L2 smart contracts monitoring. Some good progress has been made. DUX Core Unit - collaborating with the core unit, helping with creating monitoring tests, working on expanding them, as well as including them into deployment flow. That will help with stability of the backend and frontend parts of the Governance App - the main DUX CU project, on-chain governance and overall voting process user experience. Data Analytics Core unit - helped updating liquidation-monitor lambda to use new API endpoint.  Tasks in progress  We are establishing content managers for Website, Forum and Blog and planning to add a clause to them that describes TechOps team responsibilities\u2019 boundaries for these three systems. More will be communicated when this is done.  ",

                    "content": "Hi @Doo_StableLab Thanks for asking. I checked incident statistics for the last month and AWS Infrastructure incidents were mainly related to:  anomaliusly high access requests coming to specific servers and server ports (medium priority) Server utilization parameters being above normal threshold (CPU, disc, etc.) (medium priority) Notifying about blocked access to the servers (low priority) Log errors in the wallet responsible for refilling multiple wallets integrated in different parts of the systems like Oracles, Feeds, etc. (high priority)  If you want to know what were the most critical incidents that happened in March, it is those related to Poke Keeper and Oracles and Feeds. Late poking and troubles with Oracles and Feeds could have bad consequences resulting in collateral prices not being updated. And that puts users at risk and opened vaults at risk of undesired liquidation. Sometimes On-Chain Governance service incidents could be quite impactful. I checked those that were triggered in March and most of them were informative. So luckily nothing too bad. Let me know if that answers your question. Otherwise I can provide even more details if needed. ",

                    "content": "That was neither a problem with Oracles, nor with Feeds. It happened due to a sudden gas price spike right after Poke Keeper transaction was initiated. And while doing automatic retry, gas needed was above available threshold. We immediately poked manually. And as a fix, we implemented a new logic for automatic retry as well as modified threshold limits for certain cases. I do not want to go into deep technical details in public to prevent targeted attacks. But there were multiple improvements implemented in the Poke Keeper logic that automated all processes for many real-life cases, including market growth, crashes, changes in gas prices, multiple retries logic. Everything above is done with the aim of having optimal gas costs to save the costs. If we compare to how the system worked 1 year ago, it is much more independent, secure and advanced now, almost never requiring human interaction. ",

This post is updated every week to display the most current updates for all Core Units. 17 Core Units posted at least one update last month, totaling almost 30 updates.

Please, keep in mind that all updates shown and mentioned in this post are meant to cover June activity. Updates that cover July activity will be presented in next month\u2019s Monthly Core Unit Updates publication.  Summary June set a record with nineteen Core Units publishing updates during the month! This means that 95% of all active Core Units now post updates on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. Furthermore, there are over 45 updates in total, representing an increase of more than 12% over last month. Several Core Units have begun applying a continuous thread format for their updates, for example, CES\u2019s CSI updates, RWF\u2019s LTS and HVB updates, and DIN\u2019s monthly updates. Using this format reduces forum noise and improves the searchability of older updates.

We continue to run infrastructure, services and monitoring to ensure ecosystem stability and health. The team is based in different regions to ensure global coverage. Incidents overview for November 2022 As usual, starting with the overview over the incidents that were opened and we\u2019ve been working on in November 2022, split on per service basis:  AWS infrastructure - 6 incidents Blog - 4 incidents EC2 - 36 incidents Etherscan - 15 incidents Governance App - 36 incidents Grafana - 20 incidents MongoDB - 18 incidents Nodes - 90 incidents On-Chain Governance - 11 incidents Oracle Security Module - 11 incidents Oracles and Feeds - 4 incidents Vulcanize DB - 1 incident  TOTAL - 252 incidents We configured all incidents to automatically assign one of three priorities based on severity of the incident, where:   Priority 1 incidents - are picked up instantly by on-call team members (in practice it\u2019s immediate response)  Priority 2 incidents - have maximum 6 hours response time (in practice it stays below 1 hour)  Priority 3 incidents - have maximum 24 hours response time (in practice it\u2019s 6-18 hours)  Internal Community tickets Couple of months ago we created a channel on MakerDAO Discord server (#techops-requests) that is dedicated to Community members to give requests for TechOps team. We encourage everyone to use it. In November 2022 there were 20 tickets opened via that channel. People send us feedback that they want to know ticket status. We listened and are testing live updates that will be sent to the channel whenever a ticket is picked up by the team member and when the work on the ticket is completed. Stay connected and soon you will see the update in the channel. Community tasks & Cross-core unit collaboration  Community  Discord - adding users to channels.
