How will the OP tokens be distributed? Every user that onboards to Optimism using Hop Protocol will have 80% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $OP. This will significantly reduce the net cost for users to send funds to Optimism and give them a stake in the Optimism network. The $OP rewards will cover 80% of users\u2019 total onboarding fees, including gas fees, AMM LP fees, and bonder fees but will not include the AMM rate.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Lowering the net cost for users to onboard to Optimism by 80% will make it much cheaper for new users to get funds onto the network to give it a try. Also, users who regularly bridge funds will earn a meaningful amount of $OP rewards, similarly to a loyalty points program making it more likely to become their goto L2.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The incentives will help cover fees to onboard to Optimism. Once there, users will leave their funds where they can enjoy cheap transaction fees, a buttery-smooth user experience, and a rich ecosystem of innovative Web3 applications.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? This will depend on the market price of $OP and the gas markets on Hop\u2019s various supported networks, as well as the prices of their native tokens.  How much will your project match in co-incentives? The Hop team cannot speak for the upcoming Hop DAO, but it is likely that the Hop community will set up liquidity mining for each of the Hop AMMs on Optimism using HOP incentives. This will improve the transfer rates, especially for users transacting with larger amounts.  Execution All rewards calculations will be done off-chain using the $OP price at the time of the bridge transaction. Each month, a Merkle drop with all $OP rewards will be deployed on Optimism. All rewards that are not claimed from the previous month will roll over to the new Merkle Drop contract where they will be claimable along with any additional rewards the user has accrued. Only direct interactions with the Hop Contracts should be considered for $OP rewards. Interactions that go through wrapper contracts, such as those deployed by bridge aggregators, add a ~20% gas premium vs using Hop directly, which works against the goals of this proposal. ",

When thinking through this, the idea was to cater the subsidy more towards smaller transfers where fees are the primary cost vs liquidity mining which would benefit larger transfers where slippage is the primary cost but still strike a nice balance. It could further be slanted toward smaller transfers by just partially refunding gas fees and not LP and bonder fees. A nice middle ground could also be found by capping rewards like you mentioned.   A month is too long given how volatile crypto is, esp a new token like $OP, any way to shorten this period?   It should be possible to sufficiently automate this process so it can be run on a weekly cadence. This is a good point.   It feels like there should be a cap according to anomalous gas fees on Ethereum specifically - e.g. we don\u2019t want to refund massive amounts of $OP if someone bridged in the middle of an ape drop at 6,000 gwei. Better incentivize them to wait.   Completely agree that there should be a cap. Maybe a quadratic reward that decreases as total fees increase would solve this as well as dampen the refund for larger transfers (e.g., A transfer with $20 of fees gets an 80% refund and a transfer with $300 of fees gets a 50% refund.) And then there would be an implicit max refund that get\u2019s approached asymptotically. ",

In reference to fee refunds, we like the idea of a quadratic reward detailed by @cwhinfrey that decreases as total fees increase. We agree that in many cases, fee\u2019s for a smaller participant have larger impact on the type of  activity and decision-making a smaller participant can have.     cwhinfrey:  Completely agree that there should be a cap. Maybe a quadratic reward that decreases as total fees increase would solve this as well as dampen the refund for larger transfers (e.g., A transfer with $20 of fees gets an 80% refund and a transfer with $300 of fees gets a 50% refund.) And then there would be an implicit max refund that get\u2019s approached asymptotically.   ",

Small users are stuck in positions on mainnet - unless they are bridging off now while gas is unusually cheap - so it is nice to give them an assist to get off mainnet and onto a network where they can engage with affordable gas.  Part of the pain of a bear market when asset prices are low is that minnows are stuck in place on mainnet - and the prospect of a subsidy to bridge off is helping beginners that just got smacked down to regain a foothold.  Otherwise, a lot of small holders probably have a lot of small positions on mainnet which is something of a punishment for being a small pioneer.  This proposal is excellent!!! ",

This is good for the real users and the long-term development of the community. The fact that HOP is doing is disgusting, and it makes users attack each other. Even if it is too arrogant as a cross-chain project, you can decide whether to give users airdrops based on transaction frequency and product coverage, but you choose a simple and rude transaction amount, and I don\u2019t know how many low-income groups or ordinary users are. Wouldn\u2019t there be so much capital on the L2 chain? Besides, the transaction amount has something to do with your cross-chain project, which is extremely funny. In the end, the pool function provided by HOP, so many users added a pool and only one or two HOPs at the end, it is really a charity, so there is no pattern, and projects that do not clearly position the real users and products have the face to go to the OP and ask for 100w OPs ? Connect only requires 30W, which is really shameless to a certain level. ",

I use bridge product quite a lot, and none of my transitions ever failed with Hop. After experiencing different bridge products, I realized Hop is the most trustworthy bridge with the easiest UI, lowest fees and most bridge options. I didn\u2019t use Hop chasing airdrop, it is just the best. Don\u2019t judge a project by hearsay, use it yourself. I highly recommend it! ",

Offering 80% refund in transaction fees will burn through your OP funding at a far faster rate than at 10%. Offering Hop tokens also incentivizes new Hop holders to participate in Hop governance or liquidity provisioning. It is a bit concerning that you cannot speak for the upcoming Hop DAO farming incentives. You should have come to a concrete resolution with the Hop community beforehand so that the Optimism Collective would have a full transparent proposal to review. If the Hop DAO decides to issue Optimism for farming instead of Hop or a substantially higher amount of Optimism vs Hop that would be counterproductive for the Optimism ecosystem. ",
