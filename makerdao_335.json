                    "content": " Action Date: 2022-02-08  Assets  Asset Type: Social Media Account Asset Owner: DAI Foundation Platform Manager: Twitter.com Content Manager: Growth CU [email\u00a0protected] Purpose: share information and start conversations with the Maker ecosystem Last Modification: -    Supporters @LongForWisdom @Davidutro @juan  Reasoning  What is the reason for the transfer of Twitter account management rights? Growth Core Unit requests management access to the Maker Twitter account considering the important synergies this would bring to the protocol, as highlighted more in detail below. These synergies will provide real leverage for Maker to build a solid and engaged Twitter community.  What is the purpose of a Twitter account? The key missions of Maker\u2019s Twitter account are to build strong brand awareness, strengthen the protocol\u2019s influence in the crypto scene and create business opportunities (e.g., strategic partnerships). Not to mention that this channel will bring to Maker valuable insights on the market sentiment. That implies building and managing a large and engaged community interested to:  learn more about Maker (i.e., DAO and its Core Units, ecosystem, DeFi services, Dai use cases) and the broader crypto industry benefit from Maker\u2019s DeFI services and/ or Dai advantages in various verticals stay informed of key developments/ achievements and major events (e.g., product development, key partnerships) interact with other community members around Maker-related topics give feedback/ share opinions on the protocol  To succeed in these missions, the management of the account has to be relevant and coherent with the protocol\u2019s growth plan.  Why are we convinced that managing the Twitter account will strongly benefit the protocol?  Growth\u2019s Mandate Growth CU\u2019s mandate is to help the protocol increase Dai liquidity globally by increasing the supply and demand of the stablecoin across geographies. And we have a strong conviction that the Twitter account will be a key additional resource and leverage to successfully achieve the protocol\u2019s ambition.  Demand Side On the demand side, Growth CU has the mission to communicate, and educate users, on the various use cases of Dai with the latest updates (e.g., store of value in a volatile market, medium of exchange, yield earnings, means of payment) and provide easy access to the stablecoin in most relevant and platforms via strategic partnerships. The Maker Twitter account would be a major lever to successfully achieve our mission, as a good use of this channel would amplify, accelerate and broaden the impact of current and future growth initiatives; leading to an increase of Dai demand, as  more strategic partnerships will be identified across verticals and regions, leading to more platforms offering Dai more users will understand the full potential of Dai and its use cases across verticals, leading to more users using Dai and more Dai used by a user   Supply Side On the supply side, Growth CU has the mission to communicate and educate users, partners and institutions about Maker as a lending protocol, the new product updates/ developments over time, and support the democratization and spread of this service with strategic partners.  Maker Twitter account would be a key channel to communicate about the lending services of Maker to the Twitter community and beyond, and identify/engage with interested leads.   Past Experience at Engaging the Community At the moment we launched Growth CU, we created the MakerGrowth Twitter account (4.2k followers, at the moment we are writing this proposal) to benefit from the leverage exposed above, as we didn\u2019t have access to the MakerDAO account. We strongly believe that by getting the management access to the Maker Twitter account, we will increase our reach and build a large and engaged community over the following months.  What are our next steps if we start managing the MakerDAO Twitter account? During the first months, we want to give a neutral voice to the Maker account to keep everyone informed about the DAO news:  Launches: including protocol announcements, partnerships, and activation campaigns. Information coming from the coordination calls and the announcements planning with other CUs. Governance: including current polls, results of the votes and forum at a glance. Information coming from the GovComms CU. DAO news: including news from CUs and the public call\u2019s agenda. We will re-tweet tweets from CUs accounts, delegates, and community members to help them to increase visibility. Alerts: Critical information that needs immediate attention. We\u2019ll get this information from any CU with this need.  We will enable a channel on discord to receive any CU retweet suggestion or information you want to convert into a tweet using the Maker Twitter account. As part of a broader development of the MakerDAO brand, we contracted a world-class communication agency to reinforce the creation and propagation of the content. The joint work of this agency and Growth CU will enable a level up in the following characteristics of the MakerDAO Brand  Loyalty Awareness Market Knowledge Uniqueness Passion Consistency Competitiveness Exposure Leadership   How will we measure the success of the MakerDAO Twitter account management? As described above, our mission includes engaging, informing, building awareness, and managing our community. With this in mind, we will ensure a close and regular monitoring of the Twitter account performance based on the following key indicators:  Number of followers New followers: If our Twitter account delivers value, people will follow us. New followers are important when talking about brand awareness. Number of new tweets Likes and retweets: They will respond to us through these functions if we engage with our community. Likes and retweets will follow our engagement and community management goals. Tweet impressions: The more impressions, the more people we are reaching with our voice, and Tweet impressions will follow our brand awareness objective. Engagement rate: Impressions, likes, and retweets are not the last word. Engagement rate measures the total number of engagements divided by the impressions a Tweet receives, and it\u2019s a better indicator of how we are improving our engagement with our community. Top tweets by the metrics described above: Sort our best performing tweets will identify when we succeed and when we fail. The next step always will be to take the better performing practices and improve the worst ones. New activation campaigns with strategic partners Engagement rate of the activation campaigns   Some key figures on the Growth Twitter account: We will keep the MakerGrowth Twitter account with its voice and personality by explaining everything with memes and showcasing our partners. We will also provide a different tone and register statements and answers to the community than the official MakerDAO Account. During the seven months since the first tweet, we have built a strategy focused on:  Useful information about MakerDAO updates, such as ideas, discussions, and implementations. Educational content about crypto, DeFi, and MakerDAO, directly or indirectly related to our work as a Core Unit. Partnerships, initiatives, and goals achieved by the Growth Core Unit.  In a sentence, we can describe this strategy as: \u201cspreading our vision of DeFi, MakerDAO and the crypto ecosystem to the whole world in a friendly, easy to understand and funny way.\u201d Thanks to this community management and content strategy, our Twitter account has achieved the following metrics so far:  54 Twitter threads with educational content and partnership releases. 4.2k followers. 3.7 million Tweet impressions. 2.7k retweets. Average of 2.3% monthly engagement rate  ",

From my view, twitter currently is the best platform to inform people who have already dipped their toes into this space. On twitter you can see many people/entities holding themselves out as a DAO when, in reality, they have merely incorporated nominal aspects of DAO functionality. It is important for Maker to have a firm presence on twitter because Maker is the gold standard of DAOs and when people are searching twitter for information as to what DAO might be for them, it will be clear that Maker is superior. But, in order to achieve this, there must be strategic planning and execution. If the transfer helps fulfill those goals, I would be for it. ",

Last Modification: -   Github: https://github.com/makerdao/governance-manual   Asset Type: Github Asset Owner: DAI Foundation Platform Manager: GitHub / TechOps Incubating Core Unit Content Manager:  GovAlpha Core Unit - [email\u00a0protected] Purpose: Contain governance-focused documentation related to the operation of the Maker Protocol. Last Modification: -   Supporters @LongForWisdom @seth @juan  Reason for Modification GovAlpha is requesting management access to these intangible assets so that we can host governance-focused documentation to aid in the governance of the Maker Protocol. The intention is to link to these documents within signal requests, polls and executive votes such that voters have immediate and obvious access to further information prior to decision-making. Hosting this documentation as a separate gitbook makes it easier to maintain, edit and reference. Further, it helps promote a clear separation between the documentation at Home | MakerDAO Community Portal which we view as more introductory documentation. The documentation will be open to pull requests from the community if anyone wishes to contribute, though we do wish to keep the contents focused towards governance participants as opposed to other users of MakerDAO products. Work-in-progress version of this gitbook can be found here: Maker Operational Manual - Maker Operational Manual  Note that this is the first example of the Interim Intangible Asset Assignment process, which is modelled on the currently RFC MIP: MIP60: Intangible Asset Assignment ",

Last Modification: -   Supporters @derek @juan @longforwisdom @prose11 @seth  Reason for Modification Providing great documentation on collateral management is a key part of CES\u2019 enablement strategy of making it possible for any contributor to MakerDAO to be able to onboard and manage collateral in the Maker Protocol. Currently there is no explicit owner or maintainer of the above outlined content. Therefore, as per the Interim Intangible Asset Assignment process, CES is requesting management access to these assets so that we can host and maintain documentation on collateral management to inform MakerDAO community members or external partners of:  Documentation related to collateral onboarding/offboarding processes, e.g:  Governance processes related to collateral Guides on how to do domain team assessments   Technical documentation on how to manage collateral in the Maker Protocol, e.g:  How to deploy relevant collateral contracts How to write collateral spells    The content will be publicly available, open source, and presented using Gitbook integrated with Github, which will allow us to accept proposed changes by community members or other core units through pull requests.

Last Modification: -   Supporters @longforwisdom @juan @bainpm @0xdeniz  Reason for Modification Improving accessibility to auction related UIs & tools is a key element of the mission, vision & strategy of the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS). Currently, we are operating under the domain auctions.makerdao.network and see the move to unified-auctions.makerdao.com as another step to improve auction related UX. We chose this domain instead of taking over the existing auctions.makerdao.com to not cause confusion and so that users can stick to their established flow (or even use their bookmarks) to participate in e.g. flap auctions via auctions.makerdao.com. Once we are feature-complete, we can imagine adding a redirect from auctions.makerdao.com to unified-auctions.makerdao.com. Therefore, as per the Interim Intangible Asset Assignment process, SAS is requesting management access to the mentioned asset so that we can provide improved accessibility to  Auction related tools & user interfaces Auction participation  The content will be publicly available & open source, which will allow us to accept proposed changes by community members or other core units through pull requests.
