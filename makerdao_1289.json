                    "content": "Hey everyone I have unfortunately not been able to make this post earlier as I have been spending all my available time trying to finish part 4 of the Endgame Plan Endgame Plan 4: Understanding MetaDAOs This is the weekly reminder and agenda for the two Decentralized Voter Committee calls I will be holding this week, as always at 9pm CEST Wednesday and Thursday The call today Wednesday 9pm CEST focuses on short term issues and governance organization. Today I am inviting the delegates that showed interest in participating in the Endgame Party to join and discuss how we can organize and incorporate the delegates into being more active. I will also go over the usual slides and discuss the context of voter committees and short term challenges. Wednesday call link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81436458345 The call tomorrow Thursday 9pm CEST focuses on the long term design of the Endgame Plan. We have reached part 5, the Pregame and Early Game Products which focuses on the specific technical requirements for launching the Endgame Plan and the technical and governance details of executing the launch. This will also go into depth on the Maker Node Network which is the Endgame Plans answer to what to do with the maker oracles and is one of the most impressive low hanging fruits available to us, alongside Synthetic ETH and MetaDAOs in my opinion. Thursday call link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82286534666 Zoom links will be included later, and will be available before the start of the calls. The calls will be recorded as always, and open to everyone. ",

Geneva integrates token-gated rooms and wallet connect on top of chat rooms, forum rooms, audio rooms, video rooms, and broadcast rooms in one platform with all standard features. They promise in the near future more web3-native stuff around tokenomics-based data feeds enabling turning networks into economies. Discord and Discourse were not devised with these web3 use cases in mind and hence limit DAO. This committee could be a trailblazer, in case of success the whole DAO could adopt web3-native community  platforms. Skiff: IPFS-based Docs + Drive + Mail with wallet connect. ",
