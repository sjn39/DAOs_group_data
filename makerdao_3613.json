Paragraph Summary This module allows scheduling, cliff vesting, specification of vesting period as well as third-party revocation. The plan variables must be specified by the party submitting their proposal to Governance. Once the vesting cliff has been reached it puts the user in control of redeeming their tokens without any third-party interaction. DssVest also supports a number of vesting variants, including; minting MKR, minting DAI via vat.suck as well as paying out pre-deposited tokens.  Motivation  A safe and secure mechanism to provide protocol contributors with MKR incentives Reduce future Governance overhead to a minimum Enable team facilitators to manage/remove token bonuses themselves when team members leave Promote transparency by making it easier to keep track of outstanding MKR mint amounts Enable independent user control once cliff dates have been reached  The following gives an explanation of the module interactions and functionality:  DssVest Specifications:  DssVest Setup and Variables:  DssVest allows a recipient to have a vesting start date and an end date DssVest will be initiated in a governance executive The starting date for a DssVest Award can be back-dated if necessary Variables in DssVest include:   _usr : The plan beneficiary/recipient  _tot : The total amount of the vesting plan, in token units  Ex 100 MKR = 100 * 10**18     _bgn : A unix-timestamp of the plan start date  _tau : The duration of the vesting plan (in seconds)  _clf : The cliff period, in which tokens are accrued but not payable. (in seconds)  _mgr : (Optional) The address of an authorized manager. This address has permission to remove the vesting plan when the contributor leaves the project  Note: auth users on this contract always have the ability to yank a vesting contract       DssVest Interaction:  The following user interactions are possible with DssVest:   vest(_id): The vesting plan participant calls vest(id) after the cliff period to pay out accrued and unpaid tokens  move(_id, _dst) : The vesting plan participant can transfer their contract _id control and ownership to another address _dst   unpaid(_id) returns (amt) : Returns the amount of accrued, vested, unpaid tokens  accrued(_id) returns (amt) : Returns the amount of tokens that have accrued from the beginning of the plan to the current block  valid(_id) returns (bool) : Returns true if the plan id is valid and has not been claimed or yanked before the cliff  yank(_id) : An authorized user (ex. governance) of the vesting contract, or an optional plan manager, can yank a vesting contract. If the contract is yanked prior to the plan cliff, no funds will be paid out. If a plan is yanked after the contract cliff period has ended, new accruals will cease and the participant will be able to call vest to claim any vested funds  yank(_id, _end) : Allows governance to schedule a point in the future to end the vest. Used for planned offboarding of contributors     Optional Vesting Cliff:  If a cliff is included, it will not be possible for the recipient to receive any award until the timestamp of the cliff is reached Once the cliff date is reached, only the recipient can call vest through a UI or Etherscan   Authorization:  DssVest will be managed by an operator The operator will include the core unit multisig and Governance There is a function called yank to remove a recipient from being eligible for awards Both the multisig and Governance will be able to yank a recipient\u2019s award - i.e. remove a recipient from the award they are due in the event that they e.g. leave the team The multisig will be capable of removing a recipient without the need for approval from governance The multisig can only yank, it cannot create new recipients and/or awards. These must be approved solely by Governance   Recipient Awards:  Token reward before the cliff equals zero. Once the cliff is  reached, the recipient will be entitled to claim the cliff amount Following the cliff being reached, streaming rewards will be linearly accrued across the remaining vesting period. This will be calculated from block-to-block As per the above point, it is up to the recipient when and at which interval they wish to claim their tokens Awards are minted only at the point at which they are redeemed   Minting:  MKR will be minted at the time a user calls vest. This function calls the contract to redeem the MKR award available to them at that block. As stated above, this will be calculated from block-to-block If a recipient wishes to change their address, they will be able to specify a new recipient address by calling the move function Every recipient will have an on-chain  ID from which DssVest will emit an Award ID so that users can scan events to see what is available to them for transparency Once the vesting period ends and the streaming award is over, the Award ID will be removed from the DssVest module   Transparency:  Each award is represented with an ID and can be tracked as an ID to award mapping The contract includes an unpaid function so anyone can take a look at it and see what the unpaid amount is on that contract This is an arbitrary token vesting contract, not specific to MKR, and can easily be adapted for any token   Removing Awards:  In the instance an award is yanked before it has vested, it will not be possible to claim any reward In the instance an award is yanked after an award has vested, and is now linearly accruring block-by-block, it will only vest up to the timestamp at which it was cancelled. The user will then be able to claim up to that timestamp   Resources:  Github makerdao/dss-vest     Next Steps:  MIP Governance process Contract audits Expectation management: secondary importance relative to core protocol contracts/collateral onboarding  ",

We\u2019re not minting upfront and leaving it in a contract for a long period of time. I thought this approach was more elegant, arguments can be made for both methods though. ",

You can mint and put into it, that gives you a better security over the contract and over the found to be distributed. I just noticed it as yearn contract is doing it. You can image a scenario where governance has to migrate the MKR contract. Also as I said it is more difficult to burn MKR from someone than deauth a contract for security reason as an example.

The alternative you suggest is possible, but minting the full amount upfront is not ideal because in many cases it may not be paid out in full. Likewise, in the current implementation, it is easier for either Governance or the Facilitator to remove the award if a person leaves. This eliminates any overhead for managing the burning of MKR, because it is only minted once it is claimed by the user. @Zarevok , minting and burning MKR is a core component of the Maker protocol. When and how it is acceptable to mint MKR has indeed changed over time. We\u2019ve recently seen Governance vote to mint MKR as an ongoing incentive for core units - if that is still up for debate, it\u2019s probably worth a separate thread as this thread is specific to the mechanism for how to handle vesting.

We\u2019re now minting MKR for purposes other than backing the protocol and this decision has not been properly discussed. (Strictly speaking: we will mint MKR on the first vest.) For example legal considerations have completely been ignored. Who made this decision and why was it accepted without second thought? It came up in the thread about the foundation\u2019s 84k MKR. And then the outcome was ignored and this was implemented anyway without approval. In the future proposals like this should be flagged by @MIP-Editors because they don\u2019t specify concrete governance actions. The step from \u201cthis is a mechanic we can use\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019re using it now in specific cases\u201d was a decision that has been taken without transparency.

It\u2019s not my intention to pick on anyone in particular or the people who have been involved with this; as I said: I have ignored previous opportunities when I should have spoken up, myself. I think this case just illustrates a few improvements that can be made to the MIP framework. The fact of the matter is that it was my understanding that this MIP was going to be followed up with another one defining the specifics. Presumably amendments or replacements of existing MIP40s. Or I would have argued against it, for the reasons that I outlined here. To a large extent this is because of how the MIP is phrased. It presents a mechanic without explaining how and when the mechanic will be applied and with which parameters. Furthermore it states:     Derek:  DssVest also supports a number of vesting variants, including; minting MKR, minting DAI via vat.suck as well as paying out pre-deposited tokens.   Good. The one in bold is the one I would go for. It does not state, which it ideally should have:   While it supports other mechanisms, when it gets approved it will be implemented by minting MKR. (Why does it mention the other options then?)   When this MIP is approved, it will be applied retroactively to earlier approved MIP40s without additional governance approval.   When it gets approved, this is the list of CUs and these are the parameters that will be applied.   It isn\u2019t a big issue. No irreversible actions have been taken. The MKR hasn\u2019t been minted yet and the deployed instances can be replaced, should governance decide to do so. And we\u2019ll be a little wiser.     Derek:  If Governance decides to use part of the 84k MKR for vesting purposes then it can choose to point DssVest towards that MKR instead of minting.   I assume this would require a redeployment of the existing instances? ",

                    "content": " Governance Perspective on DssVest Appreciate you bringing this topic up @wouter and I am (as always) open to hearing how we can communicate intentions and future results of votes more clearly. I will say from a Governance perspective it seems MKR voters had ample opportunities to ask for clarification or delay this process. It took several votes to get to this point (approving MKR packages for CUs without defined methods for paying that MKR, the approval of this MIP mentioning its intention to allow the minting of MKR related to vesting, and the executive itself that passed the vesting packages) and all were approved with relatively strong voter participation.  Options Available for Changing Course Some people might feel strongly about the differences between minting new MKR and paying out with MKR in the Proxy. From the Governance side the differences are fairly negligible (MKR that wasn\u2019t in circulation goes into circulation, being distributed according to budget MIPs approved by MKR voters). Anyone that does feel that the MKR in the Proxy should be used instead of adding to the MKR token supply has several options to change course at this juncture, ranging from putting up a signal request to crafting a more intensive MIP. For instance, a proposal could be made to burn an equivalent amount of MKR from the Proxy for every MKR minted from the current DssVest implementation. To prevent future votes needing to pass to follow through on this, someone could instead propose to cancel the current MKR vesting streams and instead transfer MKR from the Proxy over to new DssVest streams, utilizing the contract\u2019s ability to create streams for any ERC-20, provided the tokens are available. A more cumbersome solution could be to require an executive vote for every instance of  MKR dispersal or minting, though the ramifications of this would need to be carefully considered. Anyone can propose these solutions if they find them particularly attractive and as a Governance Facilitator, it would be my job to make sure they are considered and given the proper Governance life cycle.  Background and Governance Philosophy Currently, we have had several votes and discussions that lead up to the current implementation being used. I will try to find the link, but I recall asking @Derek during a G&R call shortly after PE\u2019s budget got approved if we would be minting MKR for their vesting package and how that would be approved. IIRC the response was that a MIP would be submitted which is how MIP54 came about. It\u2019s also worth noting that DssVest is just a tool, intended to simplify the budget distribution process for the protocol. There are several ways we can use it, and for processes like this Governance seeks to find the intersection of what the Core Units would like and what the MKR holders approve. Moreover, with Delegation in place, it is easier than ever before for large amounts of MKR weight to seek direct clarification on what they are voting in favor of during an executive spell. It is likewise easier to organize MKR weight to change a current implementation, should the will to do so be present.  Takeaways/Reflections There are some lessons to be learned here, and I particularly think it is important to reflect on the responsibility of MKR holders to know what they are approving. We make use of a large amount of labor to get each executive up for a vote, with conversations taking place 1 on 1 and in the public eye to ensure we accurately communicate what will change if spells are passed. I welcome input on how this can be done more effectively. I believe there is an opportunity to utilize a slower cadence for executive spells to ensure proper communication and discussion over what is being put up for a vote. We do have to weigh this against the sometimes urgent nature of changes that need to be made, as there could be serious problems with seeking extensive amounts of discourse on the minutia of changes. However, we have nothing to lose when we are already planning ample lead time on non-urgent votes. I think aone concrete way to improve things will be to share repos and drafts with the community as they become available and will see how we can put this into practice for GovAlpha. ",

There\u2019s one thing that wasn\u2019t addressed for as far as I understand:   Does anyone else think MIP54 does not provide concrete next steps and can therefore easily be interpreted as an approval of the mechanic which would need subsequent MIPs to be applied?   And then a broader question: are MIPs without concrete next steps, that are basically opinion polls instead of approval for governance action, ever a good idea?   It\u2019s the one or the other: either such MIPs are normal and allowed, and then this MIP could arguably be interpreted as falling into this category. Or we shouldn\u2019t allow such MIPs. I\u2019m in favor of the latter. But my understanding was that we sometimes have MIPs like that. Thinking more about it, most MIPs that define a subproposal process will be like that\u2026 and those are clearly useful. \u2014 One thing I will say: the statement that minting MKR is not much different from taking it from the treasury, a negligible implementation detail\u2026 that shows how urgent and dire the need is for more participation of people with a legal background, in the DAO.     PaperImperium:  Should MKR be determined a security, the Foundation is on the hook for any that has been minted/issued to date. This probably(?) gives the DAO more protection about issuance regulations. It also makes me think when we\u2019re ready to burn again that we should be holding onto it.    This is not a negligible implementation detail. ",

And then a broader question: are MIPs without concrete next steps, that are basically opinion polls instead of approval for governance action, ever a good idea?      I think this is usually an issue with technical MIPs. Technical MIPs are merely MIPs that propose smart contracts to be added or modified-via-replacement, with no exclusion of further legislative determinations. As such, technical MIPs can include the conditions under/by which a given smart contract function can be called. However, it seems that technical MIPs are usually more or less bare, with proposed code and a motivation for the proposal itself, and little more. This is not bad in itself\u2013as long as there\u2019s something like a MIP Set (of sorts) being proposed that regulates or explicitly constraints the use of the proposed code. When this is not the case, we end up with technical MIPs that kinda feel orphaned and arbitrary, because they were conceived of and discussed in a somewhat informal context that hasn\u2019t been translated into the MIP Framework\u2013hasn\u2019t been made formally persistent, so to speak. So I think technical MIPs should either be very explicit regarding their neutrality as to how, when, and by whom the code they implement must be used and include a safelock so that they can\u2019t be used until some consensus has been reached; or they should include the regulation for its use within themselves; or they should be put forth as a MIP Set (of sorts). @Prose helpfully points out that the technical MIPs template may be partly to blame for the current state of things in this regard.   More generally, how much of the context which brought them into existence should be included in MIPs? MIPs don\u2019t come ex nihilo. This is a problem that I think exceeds the MIP Framework and affects all forms of legislation. References to public discussions that take place in the forum are useful in this regard. Somewhat parenthetically (and with increasing doubts as to relevancy), sometimes what seemed like a great idea\u2026 or was indeed a great idea stops being one, and then you have a piece of legislation that no longer realistically applies. Sometimes these pieces of out-of-their-time legislation are inert and quaint (in some USA states it\u2019s illegal to kill Bigfoot) and it\u2019s ok to keep them. Sometimes they\u2019re more dangerous. I think they should be dealt with on a one-by-one basis.   As for this particular case, if people find that this MIP is misleading in that it suggests a consensus was reached when none was, proposing an amendment would be a good idea. ",

This is a very interesting point\u2026 MIP54 actually doesn\u2019t follow the Technical MIP Template:  github.com   makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP0/Technical-MIP-Template.md # Technical MIP Template  ## Preamble ``` MIP#: <# to be assigned> Title: <MIP title> Author(s): <list of authors' names and/or email addresses and GitHub handles> Contributors: <list of contributor's names and/or email addresses and GitHub handles> Tags: template Type: MIP Type Status: <Assigned by MIP Editor> Date Proposed: <yyyy-mm-dd> Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: <List of dependent MIPs> Replaces: <List of MIP it is replacing> License: <added by MIP Author> ``` ## References  - A list of supporting materials referenced by this MIP.      This file has been truncated. show original      The template says:  The specification should be detailed enough to allow an implementation team to begin development as well as testing. The specification for technical MIPs must include the following components: Proposed Code  The final code that can be used directly in the executive vote to accept or reject the MIP.   This would have made it very explicit because it would have listed the core units and the proposed parameters. But of course this isn\u2019t realistic because you can\u2019t have the code of the spell ready two months in advance. It\u2019s interesting to see though, that the original intention was to remove as much room for interpretation as possible. On the other hand, a Technical MIP seems to imply that the immediate next step is a change on the smart contracts level. ",
