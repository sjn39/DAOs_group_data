                    "content": "With the onboarding of the Dai Foundation Core Unit, Dai Foundation committed to include members appointed by MakerDAO on its board. To honor this we posted a Call for interest in becoming a Dai Foundation board member earlier this year. Following the call, two candidates are now ready to seek election for this role by Maker Governance. The two candidates are @Daimon-Law and @0xbocaJ, and their candidacy statements are included further down in this post. With the recently approved budget for Dai Foundation there is funding for adding one Maker Governance appointed member to the Dai Foundation board. After consultation with @prose11 and @Patrick_J I therefore ask GovAlpha for a ratification poll to be posted in this governance cycle, where MKR voters have the option to vote for one of the candidates or vote for appointing none of the candidates at this time. The election process is currently not governed by a MIP, so the appointment will be limited to a two year period with the option of re-appointment. The appointed member will be asked to take lead on creating a MIP that can govern the election process in the future. The candidate statements follow (in the order I received them from the candidates). See the candidate statement for @Daimon-Law.  See the candidate statement for @0xbocaJ. Now is the time for Maker Governance including @Recognized-Delegates to ask the candidates relevant questions on how they intend to act as a Maker Governance appointed board member to the Dai Foundation.  Candidate statement for @Daimon-Law   Introduction and platform Paul Imseih Key Info Forum: @Daimon-Law Github: https://github.com/Daimon-Law Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pimseih/ Resides in the UTC+10 time zone (Australia).  Core Values High Ethical Standards \u2013 I believe this is essential in all walks of life and absolutely critical for not-for-profit organisations such as the Dai Foundation. This includes having systems and policies in place to support ethical decision making and good governance. Custodian and Ambassador \u2013 The Dai Foundation has, as its primary focus, guarding the interests of the Maker DAO ecosystem and its intellectual property. I\u2019m a very strong believer in the idea that leadership roles require a higher responsibility when representing Maker DAO in public and protecting its interests. Getting the Details Right \u2013 Having good intentions is a great start but this counts for nothing without solid execution. I like to see things done well and done right.  Background Firstly, thank you to the Dai Foundation and the MakerDAO community for considering me for the role of Dai Foundation Board member. Before I present my platform, I should probably introduce myself. I have been an Australian and UK lawyer for over 25 years, working mainly in the technology and intellectual property space. I\u2019d majored in pure and applied mathematics at University so it seemed natural to work at the intersection of technology and law. My previous roles involved a lot of time working in Asia Pacific and Europe on some of the biggest technology deals going around at the time ($500m and upwards). I\u2019ve held senior leadership roles and have managed teams as well. My introduction to crypto was in 2016, buying a small amount of BTC from a Bitcoin ATM at the back of a very sketchy bottle shop. I got home, starting at the BTC on the Bread app and had to read everything I could find about the visionaries, the technology and the industry. I was hooked. Within months I was attending and then moderating weekly crypto meetups and online crypto forums. Community was always key to this. There has always been a legal angle to the crypto story. The major themes that stimulate me as a lawyer and jurist are pretty simple to explain but insanely difficult to solve: how can we capture the transformative power of this technology as it applies to the law? And on the flipside: how should the law respond to this emerging tech? At the beginning of 2020, I resigned from my in-house legal role and went all-in, launching my own law firm \u2013 Daimon Legal. It\u2019s a growing firm supporting start-ups in the crypto and Web3 space. I\u2019m also active with the LexDAO initiative and help guide projects across the industry.  Platform Statement I have been a huge fan of the MakerDAO community for some time \u2013 it has one of the broadest range of opinions and stakeholders, yet still manages to achieve extraordinary success. I know most of the folks here want to make a positive difference to the state of banking and finance, improve access to financial products and services and lower the barriers to entry to global commerce. What\u2019s more, we can do this in energy-efficient ways that reduces reliance on trusted intermediaries and bureaucracy. MakerDAO is at the forefront of this ambitious task. Here is my understanding of the core objectives of the Dai Foundation and how I plan to contribute to each one:   Identify and protect MakerDAO\u2019s intellectual property: With 25 years\u2019 experience handling and managing intellectual property in the technology sector, I feel that I have the right skill-set to support this objective. I\u2019ve reviewed, drafted and negotiated hundreds of IP agreements and developed IP policies in the public and private sector. In more recent years, I\u2019ve made contributions to Web3 intellectual property development, particularly around NFTs (see my Github page for examples). There is still a lot to do here. \u00b7Formulate ethics policies and board governance procedures: as in-house legal counsel, I\u2019ve been the custodian and author of multiple policy documents including anti-bribery/anti-corruption policies and Codes of Conduct. I\u2019ve also prepared risk management guidelines and risk escalation procedures and held management seats in risk escalation and crisis response teams so I\u2019m well versed in the handling of complex scenarios involving op-sec, technology, public relations and related legal issues. I\u2019ve also been a board member and company secretary which will help with some of the day-to-day functioning of the Foundation.  Participate in education and outreach: While I\u2019ve run training and education sessions for many years,  I\u2019ve been heavily involved in community forum management and outreach in the crypto space through the weekly meetups and forum moderation. I\u2019m also a deal lawyer by training so I\u2019m looking forward to helping the Foundation with any negotiations they might get involved with.  Fiduciary Obligations of the Foundation: I have read and noted the Foundation\u2019s governing Trust Deed and recognise the fiduciary duties associated with the role. The Foundation has been established in its present form to secure its longevity and independence and I will endeavour to uphold that objective.  Time commitment: This is, provisionally, a 2-year appointment. I have committed to the Board that I can fulfill the entirety of that term, if elected.  Conflict of Interest Statement I hold a diversified range of cryptocurrencies across the top 20 digital assets (by market cap) as well a number of tokens in low-cap projects. I also hold a very small portfolio of Australian stocks. My primary income is from my work outside of MakerDAO. I do not receive outside compensation for anything involving Maker DAO or the Dai Foundation. If voted on by the community and appointed to the role, I will remain mindful of actual or perceived conflicts of interest during the tenure. Any conflicts of interest that I become aware of will be raised with the Dai Foundation and appropriate steps will be taken to mitigate the potential for further conflict. Final Comments Having seen both sides of the dotcom crash and the GFC, I learnt early on that market cycles don\u2019t slow innovation. If anything, they inspire it. We are entering a period where the work of the MakerDAO community and the Dai Foundation is only going to increase. As the regulatory environment matures, MakerDAO and the Dai Foundation will face challenges requiring a thoughtful response and some savvy planning. Some of this work is already underway and I am ready to contribute to these efforts where I can. If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to message me here on the MakerDAO forum @Daimon-Law  Candidate statement for @0xbocaJ  Candidate Information:  Name: Jacob Minne LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-minne-997655b Twitter:  https://twitter.com/jacob_minne Publications and Additional information: https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jminne  Candidate Statement: Thank you for this opportunity to apply for a position as a Dai Foundation board member.  Since 2012, I have been a blockchain enthusiast, mining bitcoin from my apartment\u2014and learning hard lessons about custody, courtesy of Mt Gox\u2014while following the ongoing legal and policy debates around digital assets and working to build this interest into my professional law practice. I believe this interest, coupled with my near decade of experience in US intellectual property law and experience with nonprofits, dovetails with the Dai Foundation\u2019s mandate to safeguard the intellectual property of the Maker Community and makes me an ideal choice for the board member position.  Below, I have shared further details on my interest and experience, including my background in IP and blockchain law, commitment to volunteerism and nonprofit service, and my interest in the Dai Foundation. Legal Experience My professional interests have long focused on the intersection of law, technology, and society, and for many years, my career focused on IP counseling and litigation kept me engaged with that point of interest.  I have worked with well over a hundred clients on a variety of IP and technology matters, including multiyear patent, copyright and trade secret litigation, trademark counseling, portfolio development and monitoring, due diligence for mergers and acquisitions, and IP licensing. Some notable matters include:  From 2013 to 2021, through trial, two appeals and a denied petition to the US Supreme Court, representation of a US nonprofit, in its lengthy patent litigation, eventually helping secure over $300 million in damages for willful infringement of the nonprofit\u2019s lifechanging biotechnology patents. In 2019, I provided _pro bono _copyright counseling for an Oakland, California game development nonprofit that promoted opportunities for low-income youth and youth of color to develop video game projects, helping ensure these children are equipped to thrive and succeed in any field they choose, including the tech and video game industries. In 2020, I provided counseling for a NFT marketplace, including developing a framework for on-chain recording of post-sale royalty obligations.  In another matter, I worked with our tax group to analyze tax implications related to an NFT minting and issuance by a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.  Since 2017, as my firm, Morgan Lewis, took on an increasing amount of blockchain work, I have had numerous opportunities to work across practice groups.  As part of this, I have studied relevant regulations related to US securities law, CFTC practices, and money transmitter and \u201cbitlicense\u201d regulation.  In July of this year, I was formally extended and took an invitation to switch practice groups from Intellectual Property to Investment Management so that I could focus full-time on blockchain related matters. Commitment To Nonprofit Service Service to nonprofit organizations has been personally important to me for many years.  During my undergraduate studies, I helped found a local Students for a Free Tibet chapter at the University of Puget Sound, serving four years as treasurer.  In law school, I continued my commitment to community service. Most relevant to this application, I served on the editorial board of the Santa Clara High Technology Law Journal. Since joining Morgan Lewis, I have focused on using my legal expertise to give back to the community.  In addition to the matters discussed above, I have devoted over 60 hours each year to pro bono matters, including a successful 2016 application for presidential clemency for a pro bono client who was sentenced to life in prison for drug crimes committed while he was a minor, and representation of ICE detainees applying for extraordinary bail to secure release from facilities with active COVID-19 outbreaks.  I consider this opportunity for service on the Dai Foundation board a continuation of a decade\u2019s long commitment to service in my community. Interest in Maker and the Dai Foundation My professional work recently afforded me an opportunity to take a deep dive into the Maker community and I was impressed with what I found.  While Maker\u2019s ambitions of creating a truly decentralized digital currency seemed like a Herculean task, the community was making real progress with buy in from both DeFi and TradFi institutions.  On top of that, governance power had in many ways been devolved to the community, without stripping the community of key assets and leaving it an empty husk.  The community discussion touched on a range of issues I was personally interested in, and I have been active in the forms and discord ever since. The Dai Foundation is of particular interest, and I am drawn towards the Foundation\u2019s commitment to supporting the vision of MakerDAO\u2014what the Dai Foundation\u2019s Trust Deed describes as \u201ca decentralized, autonomous, open, accessible and price stable payment system and a financial infrastructure based on blockchain technology\u201d\u2014through use of the MakerDAO intangible assets to promote \u201csustainable growth of the MakerDAO system and maximizing the public good thereof.\u201d  I know personally how life changing execution of this vision could be for millions of people who, though accident of their birth, are locked out of the world community\u2019s financial system, and face exorbitant fees or capricious denial of service for financial autonomy many of us take for granted. If elected, I look forward to continuing the excellent work the Dai Foundation is already doing to ensure that Maker\u2019s IP is effectively and efficiently accounted for.  I hope to engage with the community to explain some of the nuances that can come up with this process and to gradually streamline the process further.  I also hope to be a resource for the Dai Foundation and the community when complex IP challenges or questions arise. Disclosures and Potential Conflicts All statements by me on this form, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, and elsewhere regarding this application are my own, and not my client\u2019s or Morgan Lewis\u2019.  Likewise, I would serve as a board member in my personal and individual capacity only, not acting as a lawyer or employee of Morgan Lewis. I own several digital assets, including Dai and other stablecoins, and may purchase other digital assets of any type in the future. I am outside counsel for a number of blockchain and digital asset related clients including Redwood Trust, Inc.  In the event I am elected and I become aware of any representation adverse to Maker or the Dai Foundation, I will, where ethically permitted to do so, disclose the representation and screen myself from further work on that matter. \u2013 Thank you again for consideration of my application, and I look forward to engaging with the community and answering any questions you might have.

                    "content": "Thanks @Gaucho , that\u2019s a very reasonable concern.  In the immediate term, I\u2019ve run a preliminary conflicts check (there are no directly adverse matters), and, should I be selected, I will be disclosing the position to my firm\u2019s Fiduciary Review Board so that another conflicts check can be run, and the firm will be aware of the position going forward.  We do take conflicts seriously, and where appropriate, set up ethical walls.  These measures are important, but not arduous; on average I get a few notices a month that I\u2019m walled off from certain matters, or certain attorneys are walled off from matters I\u2019m working on.  This frequently comes up when an attorney from another firm laterals in. Were a conflict to come up, I would also anticipate that it would be on a fairly discrete matter, e.g., a trademark interference proceeding.  Were this to happen, despite being walled off on the side of my firm, I would consult with the other Dai Foundation board members and likely wall myself off on the Foundation side just to be safe.  I anticipate there will be a lot of projects I can do good work on, and shifting one or two assignments around should not materially affect the value I can add. While I cannot make sweeping representations for the firm, I would personally be very surprised if Morgan Lewis took on a position as  customer/consumer class counsel in the sort of nascent litigation we have seen in the DAO/DeFi space.  Likewise for IP, if you look at statistics on Docket Navigator, you will see that about 75% of our district court patent litigation is as counsel for defendants, and it is uncommon for us to represent nonpracticing entities. If Morgan Lewis were involved in a major matter directly against Maker or the Dai Foundation, I would consult with the other Foundation board members, and respect any decision they reach on continued board membership.  But again, my sincere hope and belief is that any conflicts that arise would be minor and resolvable. Lastly, I would stress that I am running for this position in my personal capacity, and this would not create any attorney-client relationship with me or Morgan Lewis. ",

There is a legitimate question as to whether specific candidates could increase the risk of regulatory scrutiny although I\u2019m not sure why you think lawyers are a special case. The risk of regulatory scrutiny might increase if the candidate was implicated in financial or other serious crime that adversely affected the Foundation. The good news is that the Dai Foundation has very strict rules requiring board members to act ethically and with integrity. Regarding litigation, I\u2019m a commercial lawyer so I don\u2019t see any point in launching litigation for the fun of it. Most of my career has been spent resolving conflicts through negotiation and quiet settlement. This is actually how most commercial disagreements are solved. It\u2019s just that the outside world doesn\u2019t see any of that. That said, if the interests of the Foundation were legally threatened in any way, the board should be allowed to take all reasonable, lawful steps to protect those interests. We operate in a litigious, competitive landscape so that only seems fair. As to why a lawyer like myself might be a good fit, one of the specific objectives of the Foundation is the protection of MakerDAO\u2019s intellectual property. This core objective is one of the reasons I\u2019m nominating for the role - I have over 20 years of working with intellectual property and I know that I can make a meaningful contribution to the Dai Foundation\u2019s work.

The fault is of course on us as well. But from the comments by both candidates on various posts on the Maker forum, we believe both have passion and insights for the protocol. But question for @Daimon-Law . His introduction doesn\u2019t mention anything about how he\u2019s deeply involved with Avalanche ecosystem. According to the Linkedin, he\u2019s director at Aventures DAO, which is \u201ca unique Venture Capital fund comprised of OG Avalanche community members whose goal is to support developing technologies in the digital asset space\u201d and he\u2019s also Director and Chief Legal Officer at Pangolin Exchange, which is \u201ca multichain decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche and Songbird Networks.\u201d  image797\u00d7851 56.2 KB  Can you clarify whether you are helping them as client relationship or are involved in as a team? CLO and Director role seem like more than just \u201chelp guide projects across the industry.\u201d ",

I wish I could help with the internal process but it\u2019s a busy time of the year for MakerDAO so I understand that this hasn\u2019t gone exactly as planned. An AMA  is still in the works and I\u2019m keen to meet everyone on a call and take questions that way. To the specifics: Pangolin and AVentures DAO were clients but my involvement with both has dropped off significantly since February. AVenturesDAO has a strong game-fi/NFT focus and they are a very small syndicate built around a core of Web3 enthusiasts who do it in their spare time. The syndicate was based on the MolochDAO model and I\u2019m really proud of the work we\u2019ve done: strong values of supporting teams by providing access to members of the fund who work in Web3. I learnt a lot. Keep in mind that I\u2019ve been in the technology sector since 1997 and heavily involved in crypto since 2017. I\u2019ve made public contributions to Hyperledger, Sushiswap, Polkadot, Kali, Curia, Edgeware DAO, Flare, Codius, LexDAO, LobsterDAO and many other projects. My interests are fairly broad as you will see from my github page: Daimon-Law (Paul-IMC) \u00b7 GitHub, none of which involve Avalanche projects or even investments. Like a lot of passionate Web3 lawyers, we do a lot of work without much fanfare, largely for free. I\u2019ve worked with NTT and IBM as well and they have huge blockchain teams/investments that none of us will ever truly know about except through their patent applications (which are worth looking into as they reveal a very different story about blockchain tech and Web3 than that presented in the media or even amongst ourselves here). I don\u2019t see that as an impediment - to me, having a broad experience across a wide range of Web2 as well as Web3 projects, networks and dApps is core to what I believe in. What\u2019s more important for the Dai Foundation role is that (1) I avoid all conflicts of interest with the Dai Foundation and MakerDAO (2) I\u2019m aligned with the values of the Dai Foundation and (3) I have the technical expertise to assist the Board in fulfilling its goals. @Doo_StableLab - I hope I\u2019ve answered your questions and happy to take any follow-ups you have.

I know that we\u2019ll be seeing more of your perceptive contributions over the coming months and years and I hope to meet you soon. I also wanted to thank all the Delegates and others who entrusted me with their vote. I\u2019ll do my best to live up to the high standards set by you all. Finally to @sorenpeter and the Board - I really appreciate the efforts required to open a position to work alongside you. I can\u2019t wait to meet everyone and get to work! I hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season and successful 2023. Thanks again. ",
