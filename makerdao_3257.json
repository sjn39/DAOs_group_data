I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessarily a good idea to change the tin and tout separately though. It might be, but I\u2019d like to see some discussion on that before we just go and change one of them independently from the other. Could we maybe start a discussion thread first and poll once we have a better idea of the options and the potential consequences? ",

I don\u2019t think we should look at the PSM as a revenue stream, because every time it is utilized, we are exchanging speculators\u2019 faith in the peg for current income. While I am not opposed in theory to tighter bounds on the PSM, I think it\u2019s important that we have a lot of PSM debt headroom when we do it. Speculators are more likely to help soft-arb the peg when they are confident Maker has the firepower to step in and do it themselves otherwise. When the PSM is maxed out, its peg-stabilizing ability is neutered, and so it is risky for speculators to participate. Ideally we have a lot of un-utilized DC in the PSM; it represents a $500M \u201cpromise\u201d from Maker to enforce bounds on the price of Dai if all else fails. We also don\u2019t know that much about the demand for PSM trades at different price levels yet. It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a few $100M of demand around 1.00025 which could result in a maxed out PSM. But I think that\u2019s less likely with a looser bound around 1.0005-1.0010. ",

Also regarding our exposure, the percentage of USDC has decrease significantly and I believe it gives us a bit more room. Tho I agree it is not a significant revenue stream. One of the reason why I started this poll is to let people know that we are not accepting a Dai at 1.0015 especially with a USDC vault at 0% and a PSM, this should not happen, but it happened today. The reality is that with a high price for the gas a PSM at 1.001 is indirectly a PSM at 1.0015 or even higher and either we take on our fees or we let the dai going up. I believe if we do the second it is going to be even worse. furthermore I don\u2019t think by going to 1.0005 we will change significatively the selling line due to the high transaction price. ",
