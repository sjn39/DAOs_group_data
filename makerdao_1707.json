Specification  Core Unit ID RWF-001  Motivation MakerDAO is restructuring the work and the workforce across the DAO according to the Endgame Plan. The mandate for the Real-world Finance Core Unit will be better aligned within a cluster of a MetaDAO. As a result, this Core Unit must be offboarded to support the transition.  Core Unit Work Continuity All activities associated with RWF-001 will be supported by SF-001 and the subproposal MIP39c2-SP36.  Mandated Actor Status The facilitator will have their mandated actor status removed.  Unwinding Activities & Golden Parachute  DAI     Detail Amount (DAI)     September\u2019s CU commitments 100,000   October\u2019s CU commitments (24 days of Facilitator compensation) 16,000   Golden Parachute 60,000   Total 176,000     MKR Any MKR accrued (vested or not) at the time of this MIP\u2019s ratification will be eligible for payout. If the MKR Incentive Plan has a cliff, it will be ignored and allow the MKR amount to be transferred to the Core Unit.     Detail Amount (MKR)     Will MKR for end of June quarter 20   Will MKR for end of September quarter 20   Will MKR for October (1-24) 5.26   Will retroactive MKR for Foundation 60   Eric retroactive MKR 48.1   TJ retroactive MKR 48.1   Total 201.46     Golden Parachute A Golden Parachute payout will be provided to the Core Unit for the benefit of the outgoing Facilitator. The Golden Parachute amount is 60,000 Dai. If the spend from the Auditor wallet has exceeded the amounts specified above at the moment this MIP is passed and the offboarding occurs, the Effective Golden Parachute amount is reduced by an amount equivalent to the excessive spending.  Budget Implementation Upon ratification of this proposal:  All DAI DssVest streams will be terminated. All MKR DssVest streams will be terminated. Amounts will be paid by the Auditors to the Operational only if the corresponding reports have been provided, and the amount spent by the Core Unit falls within the approved MIP40 budgets by Maker Governance. The remaining amount will be returned by the Auditors directly to using DssBlow. Any amount of DAI over the Effective Golden Parachute amount in the Core Unit\u2019s Multi-sig wallets will be returned to the protocol using DssBlow by the date of the following Executive Vote, or Governance will withdraw the funds in the Executive Vote using the MCD_Pause_Proxy beneficiary role on the multi-sig. If the Effective Golden Parachute amounts is above the current balance in the Core Unit\u2019s Multi-sig wallets, the following Executive Vote will distribute the difference to the Core Unit.  ",

Upon ratification, all DAI and MKR DssVest streams will be terminated. The Facilitator will lose the mandated actor status. To ensure \u201cCore Unit Work Continuity\u201d, MIP39c2-SP36 modifies the Strategic Finance Core Unit\u2019s Mandate to cover all activities associated with RWF-001. This subproposal includes a Golden Parachute of 30,000 DAI and 18.3 MKR to be distributed among Core Unit members by the current Facilitator. If the amount of DAI in the Core Unit\u2019s multisig wallet exceeds the Golden Parachute amount (30,000 DAI total), the difference must be returned using DssBlow or will be withdrawn via the MCD_Pause_Proxy. If the amount of DAI in the Core Unit\u2019s multisig wallet is lower than the Golden Parachute amount, the next available Executive Vote will distribute the difference to the Core Unit.

The other afore mentioned contributors started operating for RWF CU in Sept 2021 and ended their contributions to RWF CU in 3 Aug 2022. P. S. : The retroactive MKR payment for the period of July 2020 to April 2021 was never charged for. It needs to be included in the MIP.

Same for anyone that think could have such a claim?   Absolutely. I believe you have a claim to time worked for the Foundation, as anyone that worked for the Foundation like the Risk team and was retroactively compensated in Aug 2021, way after the CU framework was put in place. I made clear in my comment that i was not included in the retroactive MKR compensation for Risk CU. In a way it made sense as my direct client was the Foundation (Grants Programme), not the Risk team. However, the precedent is there. And I was in exactly the same situation as other Risk CU contributors at the time. So I fail to see why the treatment should be any different. ",

There is no double counting. These two polls were for unvesting cycles relative to June end quarter and Sept end quarter respectively. When delivered these MKR go to the auditor wallet, not to the Ops wallet or to their end destination (ie contributors). Currently, that is where the MKR sits when released through spells. The MKR table simply acknowledges those MKR dues to their end destination (ie contributors), rather than double count them. Auditor MKR address ",
