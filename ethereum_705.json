This is a way for the community to contribute. Before we dump our deepest rage or beautiful wishes about a website, let\u2019s decide on how to approach this. Here\u2019s a proposal about how to structure our individual thoughts about THE website: First, Strategy:  objectives of the website weighted target users entry points (domain name, SEO, sec), exit points  And then Structure:  main blocks / sections of the home page main navigation links on the website which people / organizations should run which sections how to balance options (e.g. is it opinionated about how to run a node)  And then Sustainability:  how to govern sections, how to manage the updates how to pay everyone, how to credit our work  ",

                    "content": "Hey Jamie thanks for taking this long form. I\u2019m not going to follow your structure  I think the first question is whether it is a shared community resource or not. If it\u2019s not \u2013 then any opinions we have are just that, and people may be better off banding together and creating something like EthHub. Which is pretty darn good and uses common open source norms for managing a repo, pull requests, and markdown editing. You get stuff like contributors and diffs and discussions on changes as part of being based on git. So I would be disappointed if ethereum.org is just a different version of EthHub. Then there\u2019s the Ethereum Wiki, which Virgil ported from what was a stale Github Wiki. This has a web front end which anyone can edit (currently \u2013 the WikiJS system it runs is backed by Git and can have page / path level permissions set, as well as user logins). I have added several pages there, but the wiki is \u201clightly maintained\u201d \u2013 that is, as far as I know, there isn\u2019t anyone regularly monitoring and updating it. Drupal.com is an example of a highly informative \u201clanding page\u201d style site for a community. So, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s an EF run landing page, since EthHub and the Ethereum Wiki already exist. Here are my thoughts on objectives for an EF run landing / home page for Ethereum:  What is Ethereum? What is Ether? Major news (newsletter sign up?) Major events Direct people to where they need to go based on what kind of target user they are \u2013 end user, developer, miner, exchange Case studies (like DrupalDotCom) \u2013 there was a call for impact so maybe those are a start; this could be contentious to curate; different types of case studies for open source projects? research? etc.? Foundation-specific objectives  It\u2019s the foundation\u2019s site. I think they should commit to transparency and open-ness, so I would suggest the source of the site on Git and clear ways of filing issues, contributing, and so on \u2013 if they want help maintaining it. But it should be relatively static other than major events a couple of times per year. So \u2013 perhaps not necessary. I think what was sad was having the source code open and issue queue open, but then basically ignoring community input, especially as we spent years begging them to help update it. Having an actual site for the foundation would be awesome, too \u2013 like at foundation.ethereum.org or /foundation. The Drupal site has a link to the trademark policy \u2013 which seems like it would be useful. How to pay everyone: I mean, hire people? If it\u2019s an EF owned property, it\u2019s going to need at least one full time person doing content and answering questions around it, plus web dev as needed for maintenance. Credit work: github commits. But not necessary at all if it is a landing-page style site, that\u2019s just distracting. I loved Aya\u2019s talk at DevCon4, with the concept of the constellation or galaxy \u2013 this is probably a good start for target users (HOWEVER \u2013 nothing here about core governance or implementation, just researchers).  1756\u00d7984 327 KB   In looking at other subdomains of EthereumDotOrg, I found a bunch of other stuff. Like, the footer of the blog links to the LinkedIn profile of some dude in Calgary \u2013 it\u2019s a Jekyll blog, but I have no idea who to contact about that other than to tweet at maybe Hudson and/or Virgil.

EF has power here to legitimize some projects and delegitimize others, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any getting away from that, so the idea is just embrace it in light terms: where do I go to download clients (geth and parity pages, others), where do I go to learn about research (ethresearch) and engineering proposals (FEM?), where do I go to learn more about Ethereum (wiki and ethhub?), Where do I go to learn more about how to develop on Ethereum (I can\u2019t think of a good central resource for this yet, but several have been proposed).
