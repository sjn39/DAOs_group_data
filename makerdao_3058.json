                    "content": " Background The vault compensation working group, consisting of @monet-supply, @makerman, @psychonaut, @Vault2288, and @befitsandpiper, worked on a process to address Black Thursday vault losses from April through September of this year. This comprised gathering and analyzing vault data, as well as planning and leadership of community discussion and polling. Over the period when the working group was operating, members contributed the following uncompensated time: @makerman: 126 hours @monet-supply: 76 hours @psychonaut: 40 hours @befitsandpiper: 8 hours @Vault2288: 4 hours Total hours: 254 hours In the original plan documents, the working group had proposed for compensation of time spent at a rate of 50 DAI per hour. If approved, this would have been funded by governance as part of the vault compensation proceeds. In the end, MKR voters decided not to move forward with the vault compensation process. Due to independence considerations, the Maker Foundation is unable to provide reimbursement for the time spent contributing to this project. We humbly ask MakerDAO governance to consider funding payment for time contributed to the vault compensation project.  Reasons in favor:  Maker voters\u2019 affirmative poll vote in April indicated support for further research and discussion, and was a catalyst for the working group forming While governance didn\u2019t adopt a compensation plan, the compensation group\u2019s work arguably still provided value to Maker Shows that the DAO can coordinate and fund important projects independently of the Foundation   Reasons against:  Would require payment of 12,700 DAI from the Maker surplus MakerDAO governance hadn\u2019t made any explicit commitment to pay working group for their time, so perhaps it\u2019s not suitable to address reimbursement after the fact   Poll question: Do you support transferring 12,700 DAI from the system surplus to the community members listed above as payment for their time contributed to the vault compensation project?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next steps: This signal poll will be live for 2 weeks. If a majority of forum voters support payment, we\u2019ll submit an on chain poll in the next available weekly governance cycle.

In general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea to include funding requests via the weekly cycle, and I\u2019ll be fairly strict about what is valid for that process, and what requires the use of MIP14. However, in this case I think it\u2019s reasonable that this be addressed via the signalling process and the weekly cycle. My reasoning is as follows:  The total amount is low (12.7k) in comparison to the protocol\u2019s current daily revenue (93k DAI). The work described has already been completed and governance has seen the work items, this isn\u2019t a speculative funding request for work to be completed. A large majority of hours described were spent by individuals that the DAO is familiar with. Those involved have been waiting for payment for some time.  ",

I was supervising the working group (in the working group channel in rocket-chat.) While I can\u2019t guarantee that these hours are 100% correct, I do think they\u2019re in the right ballpark. @psychonaut  did a lot of the initial work, @MakerMan  did a lot of analysis, @monet-supply did a lot of the organisational side.     bit:  Have we ever funded anything through the surplus buffer?   We have not.     bit:  Shouldn\u2019t we have a formal way (MIP?) to ask for funding from the surplus buffer?   We do! MIP14. I commented on using that process versus this process in my last comment.     bit:  Shouldn\u2019t there be a report of the job done with milestones and work hours for each milestone?   In an ideal world, yes we should probably have something like this. The group and the work done was more informal in this case. While I do think we should try to have a clear process with milestone and a breakdown of hours, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial to insist on it in this case.     bit:  Did any member of the working group receive any compensation in another form for the same job (SourceCred, the Foundation, grants\u2026)?   All members are opted in to SourceCred (I believe), however this isn\u2019t a reason to not pay them. Lots of contributors get money from SourceCred in addition to grant money. The exception here is facilitators who are exempt from SourceCred as they tend to accrue a large amount of cred due to stuff they should be doing anyway. MakerMan I believe received a one-time grant from the Foundation (approved by Rich Brown) to do the initial analysis. I believe the hours linked here are hours spent subsequent to that initial report.     bit:  I\u2019m not against the funding for the working group but the rules must be clear and equal to everyone.   I agree with you in principle. I will say though that at this stage there aren\u2019t really any rules, which is one of the reasons this is coming so late after the work was completed. I\u2019m certain that we\u2019ll develop rules and a more formal process over time, but there is a danger in trying to define too many rules up-front only to find later that they don\u2019t really play well in the real world. It\u2019s much easier to create a good set of rules once we have run through an informal process a few times and can identify points for improvements. ",

I tend to keep a really good working journal on this stuff but I don\u2019t think others do so I saw no reason to post it.   I added up my total hours on this and it far exceeds the 126 mostly for two reasons.   There was a point we tried to do work to get data to use for what appeared to be a cleaner and better compensation model that could cover everyone (the DAI Tab method).   I probably spent a good chunk of two weeks wall time and maybe 60hrs which pretty much went nowhere and I/we dumped in favor of going back to a better model.   Some of my initial BT auction/analysis work revealed something interesting which I discussed with the foundation and have privately with others that is not fully released.    There was and is a senstive nature to this information that myself and the others I have discussed with understand.   To this day I believe while still actionable and having value has not been actioned on due to a number of factors.  THis one alone I think cost me at least 20-30hrs of discussion with the foundation and others, thinking about how/whether to bring it up publicly and then finally dumping it all and leaving it alone.    To be clear this has no implications for security of the protocol just something I noticed in the auctioning system which will likely be reconciled within the next liquidation upgrades.   So far I don\u2019t believe there is a reporting metric or even a public place to make such reports.  I believe this has changed and is changing all for the better probably. I agree with your comments and questions generally though.     bit:  Shouldn\u2019t we have a formal way (MIP?) to ask for funding from the surplus buffer?   Yes and as @LongForWisdom knows I have advocated strongly for something like a MIP14 MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer.  In fact given the Foundation pulling back in a number of areas  (example: Foundation Statement on the PSM ) MIP14 or something like will be needed even more now.    MIP14 funding and many other reasons I proposed and have advocated for a secondary treasury to draw such funds from. System Reserves     bit:  Shouldn\u2019t there be a report of the job done with milestones and work hours for each milestone?   Agree.   I am not sure an after the fact on this is appropriate and it would cost more time.   Would you like for me to add a few hours for that at $100/hr?! (the rate if I am asked for work at this point).     bit:  Did any member of the working group receive any compensation in another form for the same job (SourceCred, the Foundation, grants\u2026)?   Yes.   I received a 4K DAI grant for the 80hrs for the initial BT report Maker MCD Ethereum System Liquidation report and Black Thursday Compensation Analysis  (also was technically way more than 80hr for a number of technical reasons - I also paid some of the 4K DAI to compensate Twicky for providing the data I needed maybe 200DAI I can\u2019t remember atm).    Often times when I do work I only bill for hours that led to some useful result which is why I often don\u2019t bill my complete hours.   I used to be a highly paid freelance IT team lead that was billed out at up to $500/hr and took home $200/hr.    I have made up to $1000/hr (for some technical testimony in a Sony/Apple patent case) quite some time ago.  Now I get about $100/hr in my full time job. My work with Maker initially wasn\u2019t done to be paid but simply because I was interested in helping the potential DAO bank of the future materialize.   I honestly can\u2019t say how much positive I have contributed here.  Coding chops too old to be useful.   I do know fairly accurately how much time I have spent.   I was trying to add it all up - just from my logging of hours (many times - like this particular instant) I don\u2019t log forum posts, or chat, oir whatever because I may or may not consider it work.   When I added up hours and looked at my total compensation (nearing about 8k) I think I am getting maybe something like minimum wage for time in relation to my contributions to Maker over the past 9months (lets skip forum posts, chat, and me learning, the 6 months previous).  I think my participation while down now has averaged about a 1/4 time job here over this past 9 months.   My current salary I calculated to be approaching 100/hr with SSI, retirement, vacation, etc. Some time ago I had a crazy idea of maybe moving my skills and talents online and dropping 1/4 time for each 10hrs/week I could get at $100/hr but I am rapidly coming to the conclusion this probably won\u2019t materialize.   50/hr give or take iis about anyone is going to make and while decent money, just doesn\u2019t compare to a full time job for a highly educated, skilled, and vastly experienced person like myself.  This does not even remotely address the highly variable and uncertain nature of these types of jobs.  This is something the DAO will have to deal with, and those working within it, in the coming months/years.   I don\u2019t see highly skilled smart contracts folks like @cmooney, @hexonaut @Kurt_Barry @equivrel and god knows how many others who are key important, skilled, experienced contributors to Maker getting cheaper over time (please forgive me the rest of you are listed below and so, so many of you are key to this organization). My job has just changed significantly recently.  I am working on an entirely new produciton facility bringing online vastly new and improved production facilities that are World Class (in fact will soon be #1 in the world at what we do).  My key new responsibility is making this new beast perform.   I had a lot of time in the past I could chat, read and respond to forum posts, do analysis, whatever as my hard work was mostly done.  That time now ends for me.  Fortunately there are so many other people here in Maker and MakerDAO now to take up the mantle.   I still have some work to persue for this space that I hope to release in a month or two that is more general to DAO work-rewards recording of effort, community grading/approving, and how to manage the reward components.   This likely will come through sourceCred, but who knows.  It is something I have spent 30 years of my life on, travelling to intentional communities, doing charity work in my spare time, and was only solvable by blockchain, DAO, and my own participation throughout this space\u2026   We will see if this is just MakerMan wind or a real leap step in how DAOs function with regards to this whole doing work and getting rewards as well as having say-so in governance issue.  So I probably will be stepping back from a lot of my previous activities to persue the completion and release of a whitepaper on this single issue.  (I hope) Keep doing what you are doing @bit there is much of your posts and thinking I agree with.   I would urge everyone to keep as meticulous of a journal of the time they spend doing what, because someone just might want to know what you did to justify the pricetag you are asking for.  I started this habit because of being a freelance IT, as well as IT team lead.   Rest assured, I am not independantly wealthy, nor am I getting rich off DAO monies.  My work in this regard I consider \u2018charity\u2019.   I still have to pay SSI, and income taxes on that whopping 50/hr pay and don\u2019t think I am not grateful.   To @rich.brown first GF for paying me the first 4K,  to people like @LongForWisdom for getting SourceCred here and making \u2018some\u2019 funding available to encourage others like yourself @bit, monet-supply Joshua_Pritikin  rune, mrabino1 cmooney @Aaron_Bartsch @cmooney @Andy_McCall cyrus Vishesh befitsandpiper wil Jtathmann @Davidutro @s_ben @Derek amyjung wouter @brianmcmichael equivrel @iammeeoh jernejml MicahZoltu Mitote Mariano_Conti  and so many others who I can\u2019t thank enough for their patience and undertanding in putting up with me as well as doing some of the hardest work not just to make Maker, but to keep Maker pushing towards the future. There add another hour to my total hours here. This post isn\u2019t a good bye but an a\u2019 tout l\u2019heure (until later).    And If I don\u2019t get to it or am around Happy Holidays and New Year.     Maker 1B and going strong.   Amazing times. I really want to urge Maker voters to seriously consider expanding the surplus to at least 1-2%, adding a secondary treasury (to fund operations, and other stuff), and something like a MIP14 for the DAO to be able to spend those funds without having to micromanage every little funding thing.  The DAO having to deal with every piddly 10-20K outlay, while important, is going to so overload governance as to grind it to a halt.   Appoint managers who have budgets, authority and responsibility to put them to good use.  Put up a place where people working on things, record time (even time wasted) but time well spent and milestones met.  Tie this all not just into payment in DAI to pay bills, but some MKR (stock in the whole) thing as a bonus (yeah when Maker is burned or via some other more reasonable metric). What I find with Maker that isn\u2019t hard is the ideas, or even seeing those doing the code, but selling it to the DAO and MKR token holders/voters. And then just at the end when I click this to post I am limited to mention only 20 people - so removing the @'s now and another edit cycle. Oh and one last request.  I want my special forum Maker Black Thursday Compensation group member or \u2018team lead\u2019 badges please.   ",

There are opportunities elsewhere that pay better and that don\u2019t involve being micromanaged by forum members. It seems like this process needs to be streamlined if the protocol is to attract and retain talent. MKR holders voted to have this work done, and should pay for it, and probably should have set this budget aside when the work was contracted. @MakerMan and team have done the work the protocol asked for here and it\u2019s honestly discouraging to see this playing out this way.

I also would like to see some time given to looking at longer term implications of our choices vs. just patching over yesterdays problems, with todays solutions, leading to tomorrows problem.

I\u2019m also not sure how much you\u2019ve read about this topic and the report that the working group has produced (thanks again, guys). There\u2019s no simple answer to \u201chow much is owed to a given address\u201d for a number of reasons. There were a lot of assumptions that have to be made, for example: debt in Dai vs ETH (which has changed a lot since March), time, what is the baseline (normal), and a whole bunch of et ceteras that were made explicit in the report(s)). I would suggest you (or anyone interested really) to check the work produced, as they frankly did quite a good job in the analysis and documenting everything. ",
