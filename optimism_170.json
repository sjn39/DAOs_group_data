                    "content": "Perpetual Protocol was granted 9,000,000 OP tokens (currently worth around $6.5 million) in a Phase 0 Grant, the proposal for which can be found here. This large grant was voted through as a batch vote, and in my opinion I do not think enough due diligence was done when green lighting such a large amount of funds. 1. Perpetual Protocol v1 collapsed resulting in loss of customer funds to the tune of $44.6 million. Whilst it appears some progress has been made, there are still customers with outstanding unrecovered funds and ongoing disputes relating to these funds You can see on Perp\u2019s governance forums that there is still on going discussions regarding this and a solution is not yet in place. The collapse took place during the Luna unwinding, which was before the Phase 0 grant was approved.  PERP\u2019s governance forum Proposal to unlock PERP tokens to compensate users Second proposal to unlock 27.6 million PERP tokens to compensate users Proposal to buyback PERP tokens to support v1 users that lost funds Proposal to use PERP to provide compensation to Perp v1 users  2. Perpetual Protocol immediately market sold 500,000 OP via Uniswap and then bridged the USDC out of Optimism and back to mainnet via Hop protocol  Transaction of sale here   I feel it is a bad precedent for distressed companies with outstanding obligations to be market selling Optimism grants and moving them out of the Optimism ecosystem. 3. 1.8 million OP tokens earmarked for airdrop to users have mostly ended up in team owned wallets, the majority of which have then been sold to stablecoins  Airdrop transaction here   Here are the wallets owned by the team / foundation. More than 70% of the airdrop ended up in these wallets out of which more than 70% were instantly dumped to stablecoins.  Screenshot from 2022-07-19 13-07-31692\u00d7420 90.7 KB  This seems to be because the vast majority of liquidity in v2 pools are provided by the team itself. Here is a decent summary on twitter. 4. Immediately after the airdrop the TVL of PERP on Optimism dumped by nearly a quarter This may have been people exiting who were solely providing TVL for the airdrop, but it does not bode well for the stated aims of the grant funding to increase liquidity.  So in summary in total on day one of receiving grant funding, 1,456,363 OP tokens were instantly dumped for USDC out of which 500,000 OP\u2019s worth was bridged out of Optimism entirely. There are users complaining in the Perp discord about receiving only minute amounts of OP as an airdrop - pretty much because the vast majority has circled back to the team. Surely there is a better way of carrying out due diligence when there are giant sums like this being approved? ",

What you doing here is simply finding some data to support a point you\u2019ve made up.

For items that don\u2019t work we stop it so we don\u2019t waste tokens. We have applied this methodology to PERP and will continue to do so for OP tokens. I\u2019d be happy to have a solid discussion but it seems that this post is purely around creating FUD with no data to back anything up and drawing points out of thin air. ",

A lot of discussion has been had around this in discord so it\u2019s interesting you\u2019re only trying to pull a random headline number.  I will not try to claim I know the exact figure of how much customer funds are still in dispute, but this figure is taken directly from your governance forums in this discussion.  Screenshot from 2022-07-19 19-42-32822\u00d7115 11.1 KB  Whatever the actual figure is, the fact still remains there is an ongoing dispute relating to customer funds which have been lost due to the collapse of Perpetual Protocol v1.  Additionally, I\u2019m unsure why this is put here other than trying to paint this entire airdrop in negative light.  I put it here because applying for grant funding while having outstanding liabilities relating to customer\u2019s funds is a giant red flag that has had zero discussion on it whatsoever as part of the Optimism governance process.  As per the outline this was distributed to the grants DAO. What they do with the funding is up to them but all projects that are funded via this mechanism is for the benefit of OP. How they manage funds is up to them and at their discretion  How will we ever know if these funds are used for the benefit of Optimism when they are bridged off chain back to mainnet with zero oversight? There is no way of knowing if those funds will ever return to Optimism at all. After seeing how much push back other proposals are getting on use of OP grants which are much smaller than this, how this slipped through governance to me is surreal.

As this is expected to be a large amount of the tokens that have been unlocked by governance, this aligns interests of both parties to grow Optimism   This implies that OP funding for grants that has been distributed already should have been matched 1:1 with PERP.     tongnk:  As per the outline this was distributed to the grants DAO. What they do with the funding is up to them but all projects that are funded via this mechanism is for the benefit of OP. How they manage funds is up to them and at their discretion   To me, it sounds like whatever OP is used, will be matched with PERP\u2026Which excludes any previous funding the grants program may have received in PERP, as the 1:1 matching is not retroactive (otherwise, any protocol could claim that they have matched liquidity incentives, or other funding, in the past).

Everything else aside, this above seems like a point worthy of discussion. How does governance perform due diligence on projects? Whatever a project promises in a grant proposal, if a DAO has outstanding legal obligations, or an \"ongoing dispute relating to customer funds\u2019, this could result in unexpected consequences. I find it pretty shocking reading back on the Phase 0 Proposal the lack of serious discussion around giving such an enormous amount of $OP to Perp. As one of the two most significant grants (that I am aware of, alongside Synthetix\u2019s 9m OP) one would expect that this grant would have had a marked impact on increasing liquidity, TVL, and user transactions on Optimism. And that every delegate would have participated in the discussion. Why wasn\u2019t there more debate? Was this simply because Perp is a longstanding part of OP ecosystem? Obviously, we cannot expect every grant to succeed in its goals, and its too early to say how Perp will use the funds remaining, and the impact it will have. But considering some of the debates I\u2019ve witnessed over relatively small amounts of $OP, it definitely is important for us to examine exactly how this happened. If Perp feels like the current use of funds has had a positive impact on the growth of $OP, they should make that case, and we should work with them to ensure that their use of the remaining funds is +EV for the network.

The liquidity incentives have failed to attract liquidity, the TVL has actually decreased in this time:  perptvl804\u00d7778 106 KB  The airdrop is actually worth two thirds of the total value of Perp\u2019s TVL. You may just as well have bought Perp as a going concern, I doubt you would have even paid anywhere near this figure. There are platforms that did not receive a single OP which have flipped Perp in TVL - PoolTogether for instance. So, despite incentives being offered of 5000 PERP and 5000 OP per week (the few users the platform has were actually sold 15,000 OP / PERP per week but this was cut down), why has there been no liquidity gained? Because the majority of the liquidity on this platform is owned by the team as pointed out by @crypto_noodles on twitter. These rewards are just washed into team wallets. The team wallets which had claimed the retroactive airdrop posted above have also not had much movement. Some bought OP back, some are still sitting in USDC and some just moved funds to random places. ",
