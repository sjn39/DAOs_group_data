Current votes are on the Grants Council, the Protocol Delegation Program, and Badgeholder votes. I voted for the grants council and the protocol delegation program \u2013 I\u2019ve been an advocate for movement in these directions, and these are really thoroughly thought out. Feedback sessions on these have been fun and constructive. Re badgeholders: everyone on the list is fantastic; choosing between them seems futile. The only real alternative I could imagine to voting for the individuals I nominated, which I\u2019m doing, is voting for everyone, which felt unhelpful. The one exception I\u2019m granting myself is voting for Juanbug because he went an extra step and asked for my support. We also go back \u2013 he\u2019d been following veDao and volunteered to be on our multisig (didn\u2019t happen), and that\u2019s always stuck with me as an example of enthusiastic, proactive citizenship.

In mid July, activity on OP started to heat up, and the thinking was that good liq mining would have gotten us the \u2018Rush\u2019 moment people missed in early June. It was in the aftermath of this (and some of the more egregious proposals) that I started to take a harder line on liquidity mining and suggesting alternatives. Byte Mason - For. Background aside (and anyone who\u2019s followed knows I have some personal experience in what occurred with Solidly), they laid out a decent case for bringing on Fantom users. Standards for grants at the time were abysmally low, and they more than cleared them. In hindsight, I\u2019d have worked with them to refine the ask, but turning them down was a miss. xToken Terminal et al - Abstained despite arguing against its passing. I can\u2019t remember why I did instead of voting against. Beefy Finance - For. I reasoned it was a massive player that promised to add utility to other projects and bring people. It has.  image1387\u00d7399 24.5 KB  dHedge - Voted For, though the revised proposal later on was stronger. Rocket Pool - For. The calculus was simple: liquid staking was guaranteed use, and better rates would migrate these core, sticky Eth derivatives over. Committee Votes Voted for all committees except DeFi Committee C.

Interest Protocol For. dHEDGE For. Revert For. Others. Across Protocol For. OptiChads For, though this was a tough one. I was deeply skeptical about the likely success of the approach, but it seemed like a fine enough proposal to get some data on. Others: Socket, Abstain. Just didn\u2019t get enough information on it. Bankless, Abstain. This seemed like something better for an RFP but I wasn\u2019t read up enough. Otterspace. Against based on recommendations.  Cycle 7 Reasoning behind DeFi is here. Yearn Against. Overnight.fi For. Overtime For. Tarot For. Alchemix Abstain. Sushi Abstain. Abracadabra Against. Other Li.Fi For, following rec. Dope Wars Abstain. Couldn\u2019t get the info i needed in time. Karma - For, following rec. Otterspace - Abstain, couldn\u2019t get to DD in time, probably could have just moved to follow recommendation.  Cycle 8 Alchemix - Got improved more or less up to standard. Arrakis - This lacked the necessary detail. Curve - This, on the other hand, had footnotes. Symphony - Against. I laid out my thinking pretty exhaustively in the proposal thread. Homora - Against. This was a poorly done proposal with limited likely positive impact. PoolTogether - For. You pour gas on the things that are working. Angle - Abstain. It didn\u2019t seem great, but I couldn\u2019t articulate a good reason to say no, when the core primitive is so useful. I think I could have stuck my neck out more on this one. InsureDAO - Against. Let\u2019s see the model work first. Overnight - For, following logic from earlier. Socket - For, following recs. EthernautDAO - For. @Gonna.eth even offered to return unused OP! Tally Ho - Against, following rec. Messari - Abstain, following rec. Ambire Against. By this point I\u2019d gotten skeptical of wallet solutions without a clear view of winners. Mochi For, following rec. Velodrome - For. I\u2019m proud of the work our team put into this one. ",

For the rest, I either didn\u2019t know them well or hadn\u2019t seen any meaningful engagement in governance up to now.  grant council, growth experiments i voted gfx labs, matt, michael, doug, fig, solarcurve, and katie. these are individuals and orgs i think would be thoughtful in moving governance from a reactive to a proactive positioning when it comes to making growth grants. we\u2019ve correctly taken a few lumps for underperforming on a number of these grants, and i\u2019m glad these ppl were in the running to shape things up  grant council, builder grants voted for dhannte, krzysztof, juanbug, and myself. these are the people in the running who i think would have the subject matter expertise and good judgment to foster the kind of building that will set Optimism apart from other ecosystems and move it toward its broader, loftier goals excited for this next step.
