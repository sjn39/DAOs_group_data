Similar to what we had to do on agora when creating our delegate commitment? They had already aggregated the information  some how so at least my profile would appear if I entered the full ENS address. The second thing is that there is not a way to sort delegates besides voting  weight and snapshot votes. Once again favoring the members who have accumulated the most delegation points. Keeping new delegates from being discovered who have not participated for as long as other members who may not be more active and involved in current discussions. I guess that doesn\u2019t even matter if new delegates don\u2019t show up automatically. This is really important to the fairness of the governance delegates that are new to the experience. The snapshot votes  filter has become a bit obsolete seeing as how Agora will handle all the voting now. The delegates that sit at the top ranks of Karmahq will continue to accumulate OP over other members due to an outdated system of recognition. This is not an accurate reflection of the participants from the governance committee. ",

I see millions of OP tokens are being delegated to the members who show up on the delegate discovery app first. Meanwhile I have only gained a few hundred OP in delegation after actively campaigning on social media and within my own community. I definitely do not see these other delegates posting about Optimism on their social media profiles on a daily basis. I also don\u2019t see them putting in any effort to comment on these forums. Are they being silent for a reason? They put in zero effort to gain the tokens that are being delegated to them due to faulty UI that doesn\u2019t sort the newest or most active members of the forums. I suggest a biweekly podcast & twitter spaces is hosted by OP radio to highlight delegates who have less than .5% voting power. That may be another way to display the delegates in the interface as well that will help with discovery. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have any sort of voting rights if the top delegates points keep snowballing. This has created an imbalance in the governance system. Anyone who has less than .5 % might as well give up hope. ",
