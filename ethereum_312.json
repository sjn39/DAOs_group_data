                    "content": "I found an interesting  thing about Metamask  recently If you connect Metamask to a custom network node (say you have been using ETH mainnet and now you connect to a Goerllie node), Metamask  will immediately send all user\u2019s public keys to this node by doing multiple eth_getBalance() queries , essentially deanonymizing all user keys and funds stored in Metamask on the Eth Mainnet So if the user has 1000 keys in her wallet, Metamask will send all the keys to the node, the first time you connect to the network essentially fully deanomizing the user. I wonder if wallets should behave like this. ",
