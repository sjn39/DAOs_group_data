(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): We are building infrastructure to enable developers to connect web2 and web3 applications, including a selection of common white-labelled contracts. Our solution will be one simple API/SDK for engineers and a no-code web app for non-engineers to create automated web2/3 workflows. This simplifies the creation of workflows and repetitive tasks, such as transaction orchestration, user profiling, community incentives, CRM, handling failure procedures and alerting.In the most primitive form our customers could create triggers to monitor any external activity (already on-chain and later off-chain), action to perform any state changes (already on-chain and later off-chain) and combine them to more complex flows. Such as simple monitoring on-chain activity of particular contract and get notified via email (or any other app) or automatically minting rewards to your community based on activity on Discord, twitter etc. to much more complex and combined tasks.

Product, Designer and Growth: Built crypto DeFi product with +$200M TVL at ATH. Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: - Fedor: A Decentralized Cross-Chain Protocol https://www.aramid.finance/- Revolut - Buy and Sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and more cryptocurrency | Crypto Exchange | Revolut (most of the participants worked here together in the past making crypto products for millions of customers)- A small hackathon project which got a few prizes and grants 3TIX | ETHGlobal Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): - Conducted 100+ interviews with founders, operational and community managers.- Currently, we have 20 early alpha testers and 50+ people who are waiting for a first working prototype on mainnet to streamline their workflows.- Built proof-of-concept from designs to technical implementation within a month focused on automating processes requiring both blockchain transactions and off-chain/web2 calls. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): There are no competitors offering the full range of features we plan to offer. However, there are alternative platforms offering partial functionalities:- OpenZeppelin | Defender - mostly concentrated on blockchain security rather than workflows for an improved end-user experience.- https://www.gelato.network/ - no support of web2 integrations, focused on automation for DeFi purposes.- https://tenderly.co/ - tool mostly for blockchain engineers.- https://zapier.com/ - ability to build automation but lacks integrations to perform blockchain integrations. Commonly used for internal processes with minimal improvements to the end-user experience. Is/will this project be open sourced?: No Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 4/30/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?:  Many individuals face challenges in utilizing cryptocurrencies or blockchain technologies due to several reasons, including high fees, inadequate user experience, low adoption, and the need for a certain level of technical knowledge. The situation gets complicated when automation or optimization of daily tasks is needed, requiring significant effort to learn and perform everything manually.Problem:- dApp projects that needs automation of tasks involving blockchain operations is complex and requires significant developer attention. This requires building a service to handle automation of flows, gas management to ensure uptime, and wide support of integrations to handle specific trigger-actions.- Developers coming from web2 companies are spending time on non-core tasks to rebuild tooling and infrastructure to perform automation or optimization of recurring tasks thus requiring a certain level of technical blockchain-specific knowledge.- Poor end-user outcome in the end. Product processes that should be handled by dApps are passed onto users. Due to the nascency of the space, Todays solutions are suboptimal and just sufficient to get the job done but expects the user to know the steps and use multiple platforms; ramp, swap, mint, bridge, sign transactions after transactions, and lack of feedback loop (notifications). We have seen this lead to centralised platforms becoming popular for most through abstracting web3-native complexities; one key reason was the ability to offer a wide suite of products that interacted well with each other (super-app).Example use cases:- Community managers: track off-chain activity of your community (e.g. on Discord) \u2192 make an automated airdrops \u2192 make email notifications- Creators: make an NFT collection and distribute it across your user base- Merchants: receive payment (crypto or FIAT via Stripe for example) \u2192 add related info to your Google Spreadsheet \u2192 trigger some logic in your application \u2192 send approve email to your customer- For more crypto experienced users: track activity on one blockchain and trigger actions on another.- Other: simply track particular address and get notifications about new transactions How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: For dApp creators and existing web2 developers:- Our platform simplifies the connection of multiple web2 applications with smart contracts across different blockchains.- Our platform streamlines the connection of multiple web2 apps and smart contracts across different blockchains for easier integration. With a single entry point to quickly add integrations, we minimize the effort required for scaling current products.- Additionally, a no-code solution will enable anyone to orchestrate flows, freeing up developer resources for core business tasks.For end-users:- We aim to improve the user experience by abstracting transactional complexities.- This will allow for basic operations to be performed without the need for a deep understanding of blockchain technology and the approvals required for on-chain transactions. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We are will provide a better user experience for new participants in the web3 space by offering the unmatched benefits of the Optimism blockchain. Compared to Ethereum, Optimism has faster transactions, lower fees, and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).In addition, our solution makes it easy for web2 companies to transition to the web3 space by simplifying the integration process of their existing web2 applications and flows. With lower gas fees, Optimism becomes a preferred choice for projects looking to reduce costs over time. By choosing our solution, projects can enjoy a seamless and cost-effective transition to the web3 space. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 50000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.):  Development - 70%. It includes engineering, QA and product design.  Rewards and fees compensation pool - 10%. We are going to make a few programs to reward early adopters and make incentive plans such as cover network fees for automations.  Marketing - 20%. Growing brand awareness and performing business development.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: \u2013 Week 2-4: Milestone 1- Week 4-5: Milestone 2- Week 6-7: Milestone 3- Week 8-12: Milestone 4- Week 13-15: Milestone 5- Week 16-22: Milestone 6- Week 22-27: Milestone 7 Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Milestone 1: Optimism testnet (Optimism Goerli) for the current set of features (5k OP)- Actions: being able to monitor on-chain events- Triggers: being able to trigger smart contracts from Atomic Links service- Tasks: combine triggers and actions (within Optimism)Milestone 2: Integration for external dApps and networks as triggers for actions on Optimism (3k OP)- Being able to trigger smart contract on Optimism by activity from other dApps on another chainMilestone 3: Integration for external dApps and networks as actions possible to be triggered by events from Optimism (3k OP)- Being able to monitor activity of dApps on Optimism to trigger smart contracts on another chainMilestone 4: add basic web2 integrations (10k OP)- sending notifications (e.g. email, Discord, Telegram, custom webhooks)- external triggers (e.g. new message on Twitter, new email received)Milestone 5: popular on-chain actions (8k OP)- Mint NFT collection or add new to the collection (ERC-721, ERC-1155)- Mint custom ERC-20Milestone 6: basic audit and mainnet release (10k OP)Milestone 7: reach 100 teams onboarded and using automations (10k OP)- Marketing- Community building- Transaction fees sponsorship programs Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Our solutions offers an easy onboarding with a high switching cost, which makes the onboarded users continue using our solution even after using the incentives to cover their costs have been used (part of our go-to-market strategy). Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): N/A Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

Proposal update 1 Sum up:  [In progress, mostly completed] In active progress of supporting Optimism testnet for already existing features. It is Milestone 1 from the proposal. [Done] Option to see details of already saved actions and triggers. It should improve UX significantly. [In progress, only a bit of backend work remains] Screens to check tasks execution logs. [In progress] Designs and UI/UX scoping about adding web2 integration. Hopefully first working prototypes will be ready during next month. As result it should enchance overall value of a platform as a bridge between web2 and web3  I also feel like milestones described in our original proposals might be more detailed. We have much more ambitious plans and planning to deliver much more than initially stated. The main issue why we didn\u2019t clarify it in details of the proposal - most of them are quite hard to commit for certain timelines like it was requested. But if necessary we are happy to discuss and update it accordingly. ",

                    "content": "After a conversation with one of reviewers of our proposal I\u2019d like to make a few clarifications to the proposal:  Concern: It\u2019s not very clear from our proposal what funding we already have which will allow us to wait for 1-year lock-up. Response from our team:   Initially we were bootstrapping while spending our own savings. And we are certain that we could allow ourselves to keep going that way for at least 3 more months. We started to get first interest from angel investors and enthusiasts from our network to contribute. The first soft commitments already allow us to keep going for 6-12 more months. I think it is highly likely during the year we are going to apply for other grants, incubators and potentially for VC funding.   Concern: Milestones 6 and 7 might be a bit more detailed:  Milestone 6: basic audit and mainnet release. Mostly it means fixing known security issues such as:  Proper API protection, such as traditional web2 auth methods or using wallet signatures. Proper service account creations per user. It will allow us to: a) more easily keep track of each user\u2019s account balance and transactions b) keep them isolated from each other to reduce the chance of being fully compromised in case one of them is somehow hacked. At the moment we are using one common service wallet for test purposes. After all the above - add mainnets  Milestone 7: Public launch and onboarding projects. It includes opening up our product to the public and using OP as incentives for purposes such as technical development/sponsoring transactions and building a more active community.  We already have a few (~5) teams on the waitlist/design partners who want to try the product on mainnets. The goal is to have the budget to support 100 projects/developers, however, this number can be vary depending on usage and growth at launch - as the key purpose of this is to incentivise developers to build using our platform and on Optimism. To achieve the previous point, we are planning to invest some of the funds to support some amount of free first tasks executions for new users (user acquisition via transaction sponsoring). For building community we are going to start from our waitlist and make proper channels to collect feedback and share updates. It might be a Discord or something else depending on what the majority of our users would prefer.  ",
