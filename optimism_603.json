                    "content": "Over the past few weeks, there have been several community questions about the updated Token Supply spreadsheet shared in the \u201cToken Distribution Details\u201d section of the Optimism documentation. None of the Optimism tokenomics or total OP token allocations have changed. As always, 19% of the total initial token supply is allocated to Airdrops, along with 20% to retroPGF, 25% to Ecosystem Funding (Gov Fund, Partner Fund, Seed Fund, and Unallocated), 17% to investors in OP Labs, and 19% to core contributors. This is described in the pie chart at the top of the OP Allocations documentation here. Any changes to these allocations require approval from Collective governance. The \u201cAvailable Supply\u201d line graph shown in the Token Distribution Details section at the bottom of the Allocations page in our documentation has always been an example, for illustration only, and not exact. The recently published OP Token Unlock spreadsheet is also an illustration, and it shows a more detailed view of how tokens might be distributed. These graphs are approximate because the details and decisions around these token distributions are up to Token House governance, Citizens\u2019 House governance, or the Foundation to determine their exact timing. We apologize for any confusion or alarm this new spreadsheet may have caused. As always, any changes to the overall token allocations must be approved by Collective governance. ",

But, in spreadsheet \u2018illustration\u2019 shows totally different story that in next four years, only 3.5% will release. The token for community users is slower and less. But there is no discuss in Citizens\u2019 House. I don\u2019t think this \u2018illustration\u2019 change is by mistake. So, please tell us what do you think.
