Decrypt covered it here => Moonshot Bots NFTs Fund Gitcoin Ethereum Grants, Raise $1.8M So Far - Decrypt The art for moonshot bots was awesome, and probably a big reason for the success of this project!  Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 12.47.47 PM1462\u00d7768 147 KB  This art was created by @thecydonian | Gitcoin - a longtime user of Gitcoin, for an April 2020 bounty we ran to create avatars for the Gitcoin Avatar Builder. Here is a link to their submission: https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/6169#issuecomment-611008961 While @thecydonian did license their work to Gitcoin as part of the bounty, I also think that Moonshot Bots would not have been as successful without them, and it is possible that they should be given some sort of variable retroactive reward for their work. I am surfacing this dilemma to the stewards & community to ask what to do.  Should thecydonian be given some sort of retroactive reward for their work? Their address, which they have give me permission to give to you all is 0xcC795e91bEECBe22A41834210E9104f15c1D37ac Best, Kevin ",
