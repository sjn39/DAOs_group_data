A lot of new people have joined Maker in the past year, and this made me very curious to hear the different reasons for why people are passionate about Maker. I believe that sharing the reason for your passion to the community can help the DAO understand its own mission better, and help it become a better force in fulfilling that passion to the fullest. So however long or short you have joined the MakerDAO community; Why are you passionate about Maker? ",

Everyday I wake up excited to get to work because I feel what I\u2019m doing here has a huge impact on the future. The people in our community are some of the smartest and most patient I\u2019ve encountered in the space.

(2) This is the first presentation of an application on Ethereum that actually makes a lot of sense. From that moment I started following Maker. The year later @Gustav_Arentoft was sitting ever so confidently next to Stani at a panel to shill Multi Collateral Dai. Again my mind was blown. Now, I truly believe that Maker is making an impact on central bankers, where they are starting to see a counter-power in the world. I don\u2019t necessarily see Maker overtaking the full fiat system anytime soon, but I strongly believe that it is balancing the powers of the (central) bankers. We are skewing the scale towards a more democratized financial system. That\u2019s why I\u2019m passionate about Maker. ",

I think the reason why, even years down the road, I\u2019m still as excited and fascinated about crypto and DeFi is rooted in the way I perceive modern society. I believe that \u2018money\u2019 as a social construct ended up becoming the most powerful and widespread coordination mechanism of mankind, even more powerful than religion! The notion of reinventing money in a digital-native manner\u2014inspired by the ways in which the traditional financial system is fundamentally flawed\u2014it just feels like a very relevant movement to immerse oneself in. Also it sure does help that this industry is such an intellectual wormhole that keeps feeding and rewarding curiosity  Besides Maker being one of the pillars of DeFi, the recent discussions about its future and mission has definitely kindled some kind of extra fascination and motivation specific to Maker. Let me elaborate; I\u2019m a very skeptical person when it comes to solving the global coordination problems humanity faces (eg. climate change), but I\u2019m a BIG believer of the efficacy of financial incentivization mechanisms using novel kinds of \u2018money\u2019. The notion of aiming DeFi\u2019s/web3\u2019s novel coordination mechanisms on the single most important and widespread coordination problem mankind has ever faced\u2014well, that\u2019s just incredibly exciting. The feeling of (even slightly) contributing to such an initiative and being part of that movement has summoned a driving force from within me that I don\u2019t see fading anytime soon. So yeah, grateful to be around here  ",

I originally joined MakerDAO to learn more about the project as an investor, but as I got to meet more and more members of the community and think of how the project could look 5+ years from now, I couldn\u2019t help wanting to go all-in working for the DAO. The first online crypto community I was introduced to was the cryptocurrency subreddit so my expectations for the MakerDAO forums were initially quite low. I was pleasantly surprised by the culture and professionalism in the MakerDAO community, one that fostered true intellectual discussion and discourse, openness where anyone in the community can work on a proposal and have it passed through Governance as long as the idea and proposal are strong enough. A community that seeks to generate real value for the real world, rather than YOLO into the next sh!tcoin (well, excluding @aburban90 at least) A few factors that led me to joining the DAO:  Working on the cutting edge of technology and finance (DeFi and Blockchain Finance) Pioneering a completely new way of working (DAOs) Ability to make a significant impact and add substantial value by building financial rigor and structure - I came from a $250B+ market cap company and making a true impact at that scale is like steering the Titanic Supporting the future of clean and sustainable energy financing - I truly believe this is the largest problem humanity faces Having a large bag of MKR and tremendous financial upside if it succeeds   image457\u00d7615 75 KB  ",

                    "content": "It all starts by giving context of where I am from and where I come from, I am from Caracas the capital of Venezuela, I am 20 years old and all my life I have lived under the political model that has brought to my country, restrictions, hyperinflation, etc\u2026 The economy was prosperous before, but the country since 2014 fell into an economic crisis, the currency loses value every day and you have no other way to safeguard your income and continue in your daily life. Since then all Venezuelans have used different methods to safeguard our money. So I met this wonderful world of cryptocurrencies, back in 2017 when I was in high school and I saw the opportunity to spread this knowledge with people, beyond the fact that they did not understand I tried to explain to them that this was the future, that cryptocurrencies would somehow change the world. Obviously the first crypto I met was BTC along with all the other cryptos, I gave lectures in universities and various parts of Venezuela about cryptocurrencies, I worked with great friends in one of the largest stores in Venezuela (Traki) for the adoption of cryptos in their stores, I was an analyst and advisor. Then came the opportunity to be an ambassador of Dai in Vzla, an experience that I enjoyed to the end, where I created educational material, videos, about this whole world. So I fell into the rabit hole of MakerDao, DEFI, etc, I am very passionate about decentralization, how this can help everyone, the DAO a form of community governance where you bet on the creation of a common destiny. I also appreciate very much what DAI is as a concept a stablecoin, free without censorship that anyone can use, also backed by cryptocurrencies which makes it the most transparent stablecoin in the market, I think this is valuable in itself.  I am still contributing in Maker writing some calls for GC and in general translating content to Spanish in the forum. Thank you Maker and thank you DAI for everything you have given me in my life.  Some points I want to mention:  The MakerDAO community is amazing. The people I have met thanks to Maker are amazing.  ",

First it has an economic base where we see how transactions are returned in a stable environment, it also has elements of sociology, because we can see how masses behave around common projects and decision making. We also see the philosophy of this proposal, because not everyone thinks the same way about how to get things done. I am from Venezuela, and the last few years have been difficult, that makes you appreciate things more and know how to pay attention to details. Thinking about this, I got the idea that perhaps this project has many similarities with taking the reins of a mini country at scale, where people have to decide what direction to take and how to solve the problems that are arising, it is something really incredible, I even think that a model similar to Maker could be the basis of an electoral system around the world, to choose presidents and governors. Even further, it could be implemented to practice a system of direct democracy, where the community reaches consensus on what is actually going to be done without limiting itself to choosing only leaders. Every time I think more about Maker, I see how more doors are opening and that really exites me. ",

I was hoping we would offer our own staked ETH vaults, so that we could offer self-repaying loans. We currently have <3% of all ETH locked but I believe that number could be much higher if we offered staking services and provided stablecoin loans against staked collateral (and before a competitor does). LR, SF, counterparty risk, and other parameters would be more favorable than stETH vaults (and 3rd party pool vaults generally) versus what we could offer on our own vaults.

Everything begins with the desire and the fight for transparency. I have witnessed economic and social problems where I come from. I have enlightened myself, reading and seeing many articles and documentaries about all the crises that have existed, and that unfortunately we must go through. I am from Argentina and I am 25 years old, so I was able to experience certain emotions of helplessness and sadness over time. For me, the oppression of human and individual rights are the main reasons why I am here. And it is that I intend to act on it and change what is happening. MakerDAO opened my eyes. From the first moment since I was introduced to cryptocurrencies, my attention turned to DAOs. Contrary to most, I first experienced the Ethereum network before Bitcoin. The reason why is simple, my attraction to smart contracts is beyond my own understanding, it was love at first sight. That is why by learning about DAI, and thoroughly investigating it, I affirm that this stable currency can be the healthiest alternative to the US dollar. Now things make sense, here is a much more important mission than becoming a millionaire. Knowledge is the true source of wealth. ",

In all honesty, I used to think that Maker\u2019s governance was unwelcoming and overly severe, but I later realized that it was actually a location where I could develop professionally and learn about Web 3 governance. Then I suddenly felt the need to do more research and engage, albeit I occasionally struggle with certain problems and am grateful that some members of the Maker Governance team ( @prose11 & @eleventh  ) have been able to guide me and provide solutions.
