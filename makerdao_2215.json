We have managed to develop a more strategic overview of the desired solution and found the DLO framework to be ideally suited. Nevertheless, this is a first, so please interact with this MIP in RFC to improve not only this MIP but also the DLO framework.  Sentence Description of the Objective Fund the development of a comprehensive on-chain RWA monitoring solution as agreed to in MIP13c3-SP13.  Paragraph Description of the Objective Within the 30d window for proposals in MIP13c3-SP13 we received several proposals for parts of the desired solution. Now is the time to move this to a DLO to parcel out work that allows each party to work on what they know best, while ensuring that MakerDAO gets the best and most cost-effective solution.  List of Key Deliverables Key deliverables fall into five categories or buckets. MIP98 proposals to this DLO should specify which bucket they apply for.  Project Management: The very first step of the solution is to find a capable project manager / product owner. The First Mile - technical accounting and auditing that surfaces relevant data but respects confidentiality requirements Data schemas and uniform delivery of RWA vault health data over decentralized networks Presentation of RWA vault health as APIs and dashboards Legal work to ensure MakerDAO can interact with all relevant parties and have legal recourse if services rendered are negligent or fraudulent. Ongoing Monitoring (only for teams who win bucket 2,3,4 and 5 work)  Re 1.) After ratifying this MIP, a two-week nomination period for potential project managers or project management companies should occur. After two weeks, an approval voting on-chain poll with a short duration should elect the best possible candidate. The project management will initially be funded for six months. After six months, ongoing project management needs are reduced. The project manager should either be willing to continue supporting the project with a 33% time commitment or pass over to core units if possible. One of the most crucial tasks of the project manager will be to define clear interfaces and manage dependencies between suppliers of different buckets of work. These interfaces will emerge through regular coordination meetings. The project manager should be as impartial as possible until MKR holders have selected candidates. The project manager will also function as a product owner and be responsible for representing MakerDAO\u2019s best interest in the process. As part of that function, it is crucial that relevant stakeholders inside the DAO are routinely parsed for their needs and wants in regard to the desired solution. Candidates should have a proven track record of delivering projects on time and within budget for complex projects with multiple stakeholders. Core Units or DAO workforce members are explicitly encouraged to apply for this work. Re 2.) Some RWA vaults contain liquid and publicly traded collateral, others contain more illiquid kinds. An example of the former is RWA007-A which is currently invested into a BlackRock money market fund ETF. An example of the latter is the HVB loans from RWA009-A. Valuation data for the former can be obtained by querying multiple price feeds from price data providers, e.g., The valuation of the latter needs specialized work from experts versed in credit rating and technical accountants who can put a valuation on a loan portfolio. Re 3.) Details of loan portfolios are often subject to confidentiality requirements because they represent specific business practices of the originators and are their specific competitive advantage. This means that some aspects of the data will never be available to the public. Proposers should suggest and develop ways to minimize trust assumptions while respecting confidentiality. After that, valuation data should be conformed to a standardized data schema that enables transport and processing downstream while losing as little information as possible. Transport and storage should happen over decentralized networks only. Examples that have been proposed so far include: Chainlink proof-of-reserves, Arweave or IPFS storage of data with message digests to prevent tampering, as well as a potential Chronicle Labs development. Re 4.) Ideally, Vault health and valuation data should be made available to two kinds of customers. First are the respective core units and facilitators of MakerDAO and its subDAOs. These need API or Oracle price feeds for further processing or as input for databases. The second is the general community who wants to have a quick and accessible grasp of the health of Maker\u2019s RWA investments in the form of one or multiple dashboards. Makerburn is the reference product for this group. Re 5.) The monitoring solution should work with arrangers because these are legal entities that can form contractual relationships. The maker should favor arrangers who use the developed solution and should definitely require some monitoring with a similar level of sophistication for any collateral. This has also been mentioned in the discussion on MIP105. Re 6.) After the monitoring solution has been developed, it has to be maintained. The necessary work has to be done to ensure data is made available on time and without errors. This is the meat and bones of the objective and the most crucial work bucket. Candidates should have a proven track record when applying here.  Desired Timelines or Milestones for Delivery  Timeline: 6 + 12 months There is a six-month timeline for the delivery of the monitoring solution for at least 1 (one) vault. This delivery must include the underlying research to develop an applicable standardized data schema, select an accounting and valuation methodology, and decentralized data storage and transportation technology. Finally, a viable presentation method must be included. This could be in the form of an Oracle or API endpoint or in the form of a fully developed business intelligence solution. The timeline extends 12 months after that for the ongoing monitoring and delivery of a monitoring solution for other remaining RWA vaults.  Milestones There are three top-level milestones outlined above. All times are in months after ratification.  One month: A suitable project manager has been appointed and is starting regular coordination meetings with suppliers. Six-month milestone: Fully developed monitoring solution for one vault. 18-month milestone: Fully developed monitoring solution for the rest of the RWA vaults with two potential exclusions, ongoing monitoring of all vaults with a developed solution  Apart from these top-level milestones, there are milestones for each work bucket.  Bucket 1, project management:  First month: A suitable project manager has been elected via on-chain poll and is taking over the weekly coordination meetings from Flipside Governance, the proposer, who will bootstrap the process to expedite development.   Bucket 2, the first mile:  Three months: Reliable sourcing of health data for at least one vault established. In the case of RWA007-A, this must minimize trust assumptions on centralized third-party price feeds. Four months: Successful interfacing with suppliers of Bucket 2. Six months: Successful ongoing operation of at least one price feed, preferably more,   Bucket 3, schemas and delivery:  Two months: In coordination with the supplier of Bucket 1, a usable and adequate data schema and transport layer should be developed Six months: The data schema should be generalized to fit all MakerDAO RWA vault health data, and the transport layer should be debugged and operational.   Bucket 4, presentation:  Three months: This work bucket can only reasonably be started after Bucket 1 and 2 have outputs. Four months: A defined API endpoint should be developed Six months: API or oracle price feeds should be debugged and operational. Additionally, a dashboard should be developed that allows the community to view vault health at a glance   Bucket 5, legal work:  Three months: An adequate structure for legal interaction between the monitoring solution and the arrangers as well as the originators should be proposed Six months: After an RFC phase, this legal structure should be in place, and the first arranger and originator should be onboarded   Bucket 6, ongoing monitoring:  Six months: This is the starting point for ongoing monitoring of at least one vault. Seven months: Feedback on the quality of the ongoing monitoring Eight months: Additional feedback and evaluation of whether or not the feedback from round one was incorporated into the ongoing monitoring. Twelve months: Evaluation and feedback on the ongoing monitoring Eighteen months: Evaluation of the ongoing monitoring and renewal of the contract in the case of a successful operation   DLO Parameters  Maximum Number of Workforce Teams  Bucket 1: One team or project manager only Bucket 2: TBD: Either one team with multiple independent subcontractors to minimize trust assumptions or two teams. More than two would mean even more security, but this added security comes at a price. It likely makes sense to hoist this cost on arrangers or originators and demand a certain threshold for security, depending on the debt ceiling. Bucket 3: One team max for the schema. Two or more independent data transport layers are undoubtedly imaginable. (TBD) Bucket 4: One team is sufficient here Bucket 5: One team max Bucket 6: One team is enough for ongoing monitoring. But attestations and accounting should continue to be done by at least two independent teams were necessary (for any confidential documents that define the value of the underlying collateral)   Workforce Team Requirements or restrictions  Bucket 1: Must have a proven track record of delivering projects on time and within budget. Bucket 2: If the solution is implemented with only one team with multiple independent contractors, this team must not be the same team that does the Risk and Legal analysis of RWA applications. Core Units are certainly encouraged to apply here Bucket 3: Must be a proven and established decentralized solution. Bucket 4: Proven prior work in data science and presentation of complex data feeds. Bucket 5: Approved legal experts with relevant experience and either certification as a lawyer in the relevant jurisdiction or established working relationships with lawyers in those jurisdictions. Bucket 6: Must be a team that has been awarded at least one work item from this DLO and that has participated in more than 75% of coordination meetings.   Dependencies Every Bucket depends on Bucket 1 (Project Management). Suppose the Project Manager (PM) doesn\u2019t perform as advertised or is rejected by most of the selected applicants. In that case, a new project manager must be found, and an interim project manager should be appointed. This will delay the timeline by 1-3 weeks. Bucket 2 is the basis for Buckets 3, 4, and 6. The PM should monitor progress closely and flag to governance if this team needs to be replaced, giving adequate reasons. One more reason to run with more than one team for bucket 2 is to make sure that a solution is developed on time. Otherwise, delays here mean delays for most of the project, with the exception of legal work and some groundwork in buckets 3 and 4. Bucket 3 has to be developed in tight cooperation with the successful application of Bucket 2. If the same team can do both, this is a plus but not a requirement. Delays here affect the final delivery of the general milestone two (monitoring for at least one vault). The project manager has to ensure that this team is documentation is updated regularly. Should the team need to be replaced, the successor should build upon any development agreed upon by Bucket 2, if at all possible. Bucket 4 depends on Bucket 2 and Bucket 3 being operational. Development can start with mock-ups of upstream parts, though. Any delay to Bucket 2 and Bucket 3 will delay Bucket 4. If Bucket 4 is a different team than for 2 and 3, any delay resulting from the upstream Buckets should not be taken into account when evaluating their performance. Bucket 5 can work independently for the most part. Bucket 6 can only really start once the second milestone has been successfully reached and a working monitoring solution exists. This bucket should not be filled by a team that wasn\u2019t part of the development. Any delay to this bucket that results from upstream delays shall not be considered when evaluating the performance of this team.  1600\u00d7924 52.1 KB   DLO Expiry This DLO will expire 18 months after ratification and has to be renewed with revised scope for ongoing monitoring after that.  Budget Cap TBD - We think this is the worst possible place to be nickel and diming. We have roughly calculated the cost for a solution using simple heuristics and arrived at a tentative budget cap of 1,800,000 DAI. Maker governance can select the most cost-effective applicants to arrive at a total below that sum. We must bear in mind that RWA vaults currently back more than 600M DAI. That being said, the cost of the monitoring should be shared with arrangers and/or originators and potential applicants, and legacy vaults need to be evaluated to see if they are cost-effective if suitable monitoring is in place.  How to apply to this DLO Organizations that want to apply to one, some, or all of the five (5) work buckets above should propose a MIP98 referencing this DLO and the respective bucket. Each application should only be for one bucket. A team should submit one application per bucket if they want to cover multiple buckets. This makes comparing offers easier for the community. The proposals can include a link to a joint proposal where the community can see the whole offer at a glance. It also increases the chances of getting selected because it doesn\u2019t \u201cput all the eggs in one basket.\u201d Applicants should make sure to specify their qualifications and include any reference projects where possible. The DLO seeks to develop a solution that works as a whole but will likely be implemented by multiple teams. As such, the applicants should ensure they are willing to work together and define interfaces with as much detail and openness as possible. Coordination meetings: Upon ratification, there will be one at least half-hour coordination meeting for interested applicants to meet and discuss how to interact best. This meeting will initially be hosted by the proposer - Flipside Governance - with the intent to pass on the hosting to one of the applicants at the soonest possible point in time. ",

Items 1-3 are tied together in my mind and 4 is a bit of a standalone item.  Are RWA counterparties satisfying MakerDAO\u2019s information rights pursuant to any off-chain structures in place? Typically handled by credit professionals representing the agent (i.e., internal) Is information provided high quality (e.g., digestible, cleanly formatted)? This is typically handled by credit professionals representing the agent (i.e., internal). [Loan Level] Is information provided accurate? This is typically where a third party (e.g., audit / operational due diligence provider(s)) gets involved. Responsibilities typically include sampling receivables from a borrower-provided data tape and cross-referencing cash movement / product structure vis-a-vis what is being represented to the lender.  [Loan Level] What is the fair value of the position? This is typically conducted through either (i) credit professionals representing the agent performing valuations on a regular cadence (e.g., monthly, quarterly) with that work verified by third-party auditor, or (ii) valuations conducted entirely by third-party auditor. [Position Level]  Having worked with third-party auditors / operational due diligence firms in the past, this can be costly (and bifurcated) at both the Loan Level and the Position Level. All said, I think of this third-party data verification as a very different workstream than data ingestion / manipulation (which could reasonably done for both public and private deals). It may be worthwhile breaking out this audit function comparably to how you split out item 5 for legal-only professionals. Open to alternative perspectives and feedback!  Collin  ",

Maybe @SebVentures has a more competent grasp of the situation. What we need are independent third parties to attest or spot-check relevant information to increase the security and dependability of our RWA information. ad 2.) Information is provided in different formats by different arrangers. We need on source of truth. We also need a stringent definition of what high-quality information looks like. This is easier said than done, because vaults are so different. Information for a BlackRock MMF ETF have very different requirements than for vaults that consist of tranches of residential mortgages. ad 3.) Like you say, this is exactly where a third party needs to enter. ad 4.) This needs to be defined in the relevant scopes and publicized so arrangers know precisely what to provide and can proactively work towards MakerDAO. Regarding the cost: As far as I have learned, the cost is mostly a function of the level of security needed. We need to define standard procedures that allow quick spot-checks, and flag vaults in case of underperformance. Then we need to lean on originators or arrangers to provide more costly and in-depth attestations in case the collateral quality goes south, in my opinion. I\u2019m however not a finance person by training and would be very interested in examples from your personal experience on how such a process can be structured to be the most cost efficient while also being able to flag risks with some modicum of certainty.

It\u2019s nuanced and depends on the deal. For instance, on MIP65 while I put values for the ETFs myself on chain, anyone can easily check on iShares website if it is correct or not. Oracles will allows more operation-related stuff but for just reporting it is fine. On HVB, we already pay Ankura for the \u201cauditing\u201d and reporting. On which Strategic Finance does another round of both \u201caudit\u201d and reporting. It doesn\u2019t look that way, but @roo spent quite some time on it dealing with spreadsheet and figuring out some numbers. The problem is more that we have layers of servicers and lack of access to some. Maker community decided to reduce the powers of CU to nothing for trust and decentralization which leads to quite some complexities. I would emphase that the discussion so far is quite tech related and tech is not really important. It\u2019s the easy part. The hard part of RWA monitoring is to deal with random stuff and to be proactive. Processes and tech are great to automate/improve something that is stable. I wouldn\u2019t say we are at the stable stage (to start with what is the RWA strategy of MakerDAO, the nitty gritty of legal structures, \u2026). ",

                    "content": "MakerDAO Community, Thank you Raphael for identifying that tracking off-chain real world asset vaults is a DAO Level Objective (DLO)!  The Problem:  It looks like there is debate about the problem that needs to be solved right now. The problem we see is that the RWA data, published in a variety of raw data formats, has not been standardized. Standardization enables all RWA accounts to be comparable apples-to-apples. Right now, that is not possible. So, few people know what is going on with RWA. We believe that the most useful thing we can do for MakerDAO is standardize the raw data that is provided by each Arranger. Our team wants to play the role of collecting the raw data, standardizing it, and serving it via API and .csv to whoever wants to analyze it. This type of data management work is called ETL (extract, transform, load). Our team is experienced in managing the ETL of public records data from 3,000+ counties, real estate data that is similar to MakerDAO\u2019s RWA data. We will help MakerDAO establish ever-improving data reporting requirements and we will do the legwork to help Arrangers meet those requirements.  Data Collection:  As data collectors, our role is to hunt down the raw data from each Arranger (Originator, Servicer, Trustee, etc.) and make sense of it. Making sense of it includes transcribing it into a database. We will publish that transcribed raw data as .csv for the community. We will identify gaps in the data and circle back to arrangers to fill those gaps. We call this work \u201cData Munging.\u201d This is the most boring, tedious work, and we want to do it so that nobody else has to. We have the hustle to be proactive and take on the random stuff inherent in the job of data collection. As a demonstration of our ability to do this work, please see this .csv with a batch of raw data from January, 2023: here  Data Standardization:  As data standardizers, we will establish a Standard Schema for RWA data. Here is a first draft of a Standard Schema. The standardization job entails migrating the raw data into standardized data that conforms with the Standard Schema. As a demonstration of our ability to do this work, please see this .csv and API endpoint.  Data Publishing:  Our role as data publishers is to establish a publishing cadence that the community can rely on. At this time, a monthly cadence seems to make sense, with data for each month being published by the 15th of the next month. We will publish it off-chain and on-chain.   Off-Chain: Here again is an example of the standardized data as .csv and via API.   On-Chain: We will publish the raw and standardized datasets on Arweave. Then we will publish an ethereum transaction with the hash and URL of that published data.   Calls to publish the data on-chain have been vague. Is there a belief that we will publish all RWA data on Ethereum? While, I believe, Ethereum does not have a limit for the length of the input data, the input data consumes gas. There will be a lot of RWA data and publishing it straight to Ethereum will be expensive. We believe that is a bad use of ETH for MakerDAO. We propose publishing the data off-chain via .csv and API in a manner that is easy for frontend developers to use. Then, to create an immutable record of the RWA data, we propose publishing it to Arweave, which is both permanent and cost efficient. We can publish the Arweave URL and/or hash in an Ethereum transaction.  Oracles:  Most calls for an Oracle here are inappropriate. The data will be put forward by a real world counterparty who is legally liable for errors and omissions. They cannot run away with money and hide. If they make a mistake or misrepresent data, MakerDAO can figure out how to sue them seeking recovery and restitution. They have insurance. None of the counterparties or service providers want to ruin their reputation by publishing erroneous data. These are not degen ANONs. If they steal money, they will be prosecuted criminally. Additionally, the underlying assets are not nearly as volatile as ETH or other tokens. It is extremely unlikely that a position of a meaningful size will see principal impairment of a meaningful amount so rapidly that an Arranger must exit the position. Arrangers probably have stop losses to automate liquidations. Vault-level automated liquidations or parameter changes seem like overengineering at this stage and could be counterproductive. Using a Chainlink or MakerDAO oracle for price data about publicly traded assets could make sense, but using a software oracle for portfolio information (dollars invested, position size, P&L lifetime, etc.) doesn\u2019t make any sense. Most RWA data is as reliable as our counterparty and/or service provider. We cannot confirm it is accurate by using software. The best mechanism to validate the correctness of data provided by an Arranger or service provider is with the audit and attestation of another service provider. Our team will be the first line of defense to spot errors, omissions, gaps, discrepancies, and troubling patterns.  Frontend Dashboards:  This DLO calls for a proposal addressing frontend dashboards. A beautiful frontend dashboard of RWA data is something we all want. Our team believes that the greatest positive impact we can have towards that dashboard is to focus on the boring, but necessary, work of data standardization that enables frontend builders and data analysts. We want to support the proliferation of many frontends like MakerBurn, DAIstats, and RWA.xyz. The data pipeline we propose is the infrastructure needed to facilitate competition among frontends. What\u2019s important is that each frontend has access to the same, high quality, standardized data.  Budget: This work can be done by one full-time equivalent (one person full time or, more likely, two people part time), supported by one or two subcontractors for basic tasks. We think $100,000 DAI per year, or $8,333 per month, is sufficient for us to build and operate this ETL system. ",
