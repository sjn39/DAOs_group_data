Recording is here: Jan 10 Gov Call Recording.mp4 - Google Drive Summary of discussion:  First token-house upgrade vote coming for Bedrock!!  [Request for Comment] Protocol Upgrade Proposal Information What kind of info would you like to see in the proposal for network upgrades?  Security (audits, bug bounties) timeline and implementation details Why are we doing this upgrade? Potential community AMA? Stakeholders will need time to react to vote passing   Proposed template will be put on the forum later today! This is a big step for the token house & Optimism (get excited)     Question on incentivizing builders to build w/bedrock  We currently have two posts to gather grant idea requests for each sub-committee In the first week after voting cycle #9b, grant committees will put out their framework and can draw from these posts Contribute your ideas here:  Builders grants: Request for Grants: Builders Grants  Growth Experiments grants: Request for Grants: Growth Experiments      What if a grant committee member submits a proposal?  They can do this, but declare conflict in nomination & not vote   Questions about the types of projects to nominate for RPGF2  Round 2 is focused on things for the Optimism ecosystem specifically This will likely evolve as we get further into voting rounds We need to get to the point where Optimism & RPGF is self-sustaining now in order to do more good in the future    Next meeting will be next week! -Michael  ",
