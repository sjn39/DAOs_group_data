                    "content": " Context GovAlpha has noticed that we have needed to deal directly with RWA originators / issuers over the past year. Due to a number of factors, many of these issuers are frustrated with the opacity and speed of the processes in place at MakerDAO. Dealing with issues surrounding real world assets has become more common recently, likely due to the leadership transition within the Real World Finance Core Unit. In an ideal world, GovAlpha would not be spending so much time dealing with the concerns of RWA issuers. This forum post is meant to both:  Clarify the existing available options to Real World Asset issuers that want to be onboarded at Maker. Determine whether governance supports a temporary fast-track process to ease some of the frustration and backlog across existing issuers.   Existing Options for RWA Onboarding As GovAlpha sees it, the existing options available to RWA issuers are:  Working with the Real World Finance Core Unit to propose using the weekly governance cycle. Propose onboarding via the MIPs framework as a new MIP (not only a MIP6 application.)  GovAlpha strongly recommends working with the Real World Finance Core Unit as a starting point. Note that when pursuing option #2, it is expected that the MIP in question contains the information required for Maker Governance to make an informed decision on the collateral. This includes, but is not limited to:  The desired on-chain parameters for the RWA vault. A full description of the collateral, how it is secured, and what recourse MakerDAO has in the event of issues. A clear description of the terms of the proposed agreement with MakerDAO.   Temporary Fast-Track Process Additionally, GovAlpha would like to determine whether the Maker governance wishes to support a temporary fast-track option for issuers that have worked with Maker in the past. Multiple issuers have spoken to us and expressed concern about the delay between an initial application and concrete decision-making taking place. We feel that this may be a way to mitigate this and help show that Maker is considerate of the demands on issuers and their timelines. Following are what we consider to be the pros and cons of this approach:   Pro - Shows that Maker can be flexible and sensitive to issues facing RWA issuers / arrangers that wish to work with MakerDAO.  Pro - Could allow MakerDAO to onboard RWA faster, leading to more DAI minted, and increased revenues.  Con - Requires Maker Governance to decide whether proposed collateral is safe and benefits Maker without evaluation from core units.  Con - May expose Maker to additional risk as a result of imperfect legal frameworks.  Con - Undermines the mandate of the Real World Finance Core Unit.  Con - Bypasses the monthly governance process.   Fast Track Process Requirements  The issuer / arranger must have been working with Maker for at least 1 month in the past. The outcome of individual fast-track processes will be done via signal request (both off-chain and on-chain parts as usual.) The details of the collateral / structure onboarding must be written up in MIP form and following both the general MIP template and containing the information required for Maker Governance to make an informed decision on the collateral / structure. This MIP will be marked \u2018Accepted\u2019 if the signal request is successful. The full details must be made public in MIP form and a signal must begin prior to April 1st, which will mark the end of this temporary fast-track process. The off-chain portion of the signal must last for fourteen days, if successful it will move on-chain on the following Monday. GovAlpha must sign off on the signal to ensure that it meets both the general signal requirements and these fast-track requirements. @Prose11 and @LongForWisdom are the contacts for this.     Should we allow issuers / arrangers that meet the requirements above to attempt to onboard their collateral / structure via a temporary fast-track process for the next 1 month?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps for this poll The off-chain portion of this signal request will last for 1 week, and will conclude on 2022-03-09. If the off-chain portion is successful, this signal will move on-chain on the following Monday (2022-03-14.)  Next Steps for Issuers / Originators For issuers wishing to use this fast-track process as soon as possible we suggest the following:   Propose a signal request as soon as you have met the requirements and in parallel to this general signal.   If this general signal is unsuccessful either off-chain or on-chain, the outcome of any specific signal will be rendered null and void and no fast-tracking process will take place. In this eventuality, we suggest issuers pursue onboarding with the Real World Finance Core Unit or via the full MIPs Process.   ",

I want to make clear that we\u2019ve posted this signal as a way to ensure that governance has visibility and optionality on moving forward more quickly with the onboarding of real world assets. GovAlpha will not vote in this signal, and neither supports or opposes any outcome. However, we felt it was important to make the question public given recent conversations with Maker\u2019s potential RWA partners. We recommend that potential RWA partners work with the Real World Finance team as a first point of call, and to use the MIPs process if they wish to present directly to Maker Governance. We feel this fast-track process is workable, but from a governance standpoint prefer the monthly governance cycle under the MIPs framework due to the requirement for a longer RFC period. ",

I will ABSTAIN only because of my personal involvement in the underwriting and reviewing process. However, I will remind the community that bridging real world and DeFi has never been done before, and is complex. We are seeing finally a significant improvement across the board, and I\u2019m sure that all credible and scalable counterparties will recognise that the connection requires heavy lifting and is inconsistent with a fast tracked process. I am comfortable to assert that no professional and credible counterparts should endorse an unprofessional, and unsubstantiated, application process, as it moves the playing field from one of merit to one of political lobbying.

Also, I am an old-fashioned Kiwi that believes in civility and professional dealing of any matter in the affairs of the RWA, by removing my personal bias or personality from the subject of evaluation. But I\u2019ve also been around for sometime. I truly believe that professionalisation and multi-CU sharing of responsibilities for delivering RWAs is the only path forward for Maker to become a well-regarded player in this market and to create strong basis for decentralisation. I make every humanly possible effort in creating bridges within the DAO between CUs to streamline and professionalise the process. It\u2019s a destination with many steps to get there. But I truly believe that not making those bridges puts us in a worse off position of defiance and lack of mutual trust, internally (i.e. lender side). Guess what, we\u2019re humans. Without mutual trust and professional respect we\u2019ll achieve nothing. At least, nothing together. This SR matter in particular sort of threw me off my normal balance. I am deeply disappointed this conversation was not held prior to a SR with the required professional inputs taken into account before a call to action. Taking professional inputs from borrowers only is certainly not an advisable strategy if you sit on the lender side of the equation. This \u201cfast-track\u201d approach is deeply disturbing. At this stage of the evolution of RWAs, enabling full self-dealing by borrowers in a pure DeFi way without any lender side oversight or due-diligence with a wide variety of possible collateral and structure type considerations is not about giving Delegates and MKR tokenholders an option. It\u2019s about architecting a roadmap for catastrophic borrower behaviour with many implications for credit risk at the core of the protocol i.e. DAI and MKR. While a \u201cfast-track\u201d approach is something that we could one day aim for (maybe), doing this right now is a \u201ckamikaze\u201d approach at best. Every @Recognized-Delegates and token-holder should be informed this is even a path the Community is considering seriously. Why don\u2019t we just hand off DAI for free and press the write-off button simultaneously, then? ",

I\u2019m confident the process will get better over time as legal issues are addressed and Maker gains more experience with underwriting and loan processing. That being said, these issuers are presumably approaching us for a reason - they can\u2019t get as good of a deal with traditional bank or non-bank financing as we might be willing to offer. If they had a traditional lender willing to offer them credit on similar terms, we would not be having this conversation because the issuers would have already moved on. What I take from this is, the issuers coming to Maker are likely to have a worse risk profile than the market at large (at least in the aggregate) and we should not cut corners on credit or legal review to accommodate them. Doing so could lead to further adverse selection. ",

It is relevant but soon hopefully not anymore, as we are seeing high-quality and institutional borrowers approaching the protocol because Maker would still be a useful extra pool of liquidity, and the engagement with DeFi might help their equity story. We cannot share those names yet due to confidentiality, but we have seen a step-change in the level of the counterparts and collateral. There is another point though I would like to stress again. We have seen significantly (sometimes absolutely fatally) flawed legal documentation in some of the reviewed proposals. Our opinion has been corroborated by top-notch international legal firms. We have not shared those with the community since they often refer to proposals that haven\u2019t yet looked for approval on forum and hence might still be improved. By offering a blank-cheque-type of approval through Governance, counterparts will have the ability to see their proposals approved without any legal nor technical review whatsoever. This is outrageous for any traditional lender (would you ever give approval to lend 500m USD without a lawyer reviewing a contract?), and especially so for an asset class that has so many new hurdles like DeFi.

There are few that understand this more than CES due to our mandate of focusing on Dai supply. To be clear, I\u2019ve voted NO on this Signal Request. I want to reinforce something that GovAlpha pointed out in the Signal Request. There is a process today for onboarding collateral. It\u2019s the MIP6. Inside of that is the Collateral Application Template. The RWF team added to this template a little while ago to ask for specific detail since crypto_native !== RealWorldAssets. I believe this benefits the entire community and to help us all understand the details behind these assets. I have not been consulted on this Signal Request so I am reading and interpreting it on my own. Overall, I am highly confused on what we are trying to accomplish.   MIP6 - The current MIP6 process does not require anyone to work through RWF\u2026or CES, PE, Oracles, or any Core Unit (CU). That is by design and I fully support it. If you want to propose something, do it then allow the community to provide feedback. I know the process is not perfect, and we\u2019re working on it. It\u2019s pretty quick to a signal when you follow it.  No Core Unit Assessments - I mean, ok, I\u2019m game. I\u2019d also like to ask the community, which of you will be doing the coding and ensuring the solution will actually work and be secure when deployed? I\u2019d love to find a parallel PE/CES team to help with the work. Also, who is doing the Oracle, Risk, and Legal work? Mandates allow all of us to understand the purpose of a CU. A mandate is not literal.  Governance Process - I am supportive of changing and iterating on our processes. I have spend my entire career doing this. I\u2019m not sure I get the urgency of \u201cbypassing\u201d our current processes and why this is SO critical at this moment.  On a personal appeal level, I\u2019d appreciate a level of transparency of what is truly going on here. A \u201cwin/lose\u201d mentality will pull this project apart. The pie is huge and I\u2019m sensing a lot of scarcity and fear right now. Is this about money, being \u201cright\u201d, or something else? And last\u2026 Disclaimer: I have no financial interests in any of the projects or organizations relating to proposals currently in the RWA deal queue. If I had any conflicts, I would have Abstained my vote. ",

And they see that DeFi could be a much better solution in the future. And to have the first mover advantage in this new space they are willing to take on some risk of their own and opt for in many ways a shittier product. \u201cWho would want to use the e-commerce to buy stuff when you can go to a department store and find more products?\u201d Optionality is a huge plus that a lot of issuers see by adopting DeFi. By not being dependent as much on a single bank financing you, gives you a lot of leverage and protects you in case this bank wants to cancel your line of credit. Cost structure: the traditional world has countless intermediaries that take their cut. We can\u2019t get rid of all of them but I would want to believe that Maker cuts out quite a few of them. Maker also currently has a 0% cost of capital (no DSR). This is not true for banks. This means Maker can offer better terms while still making a higher risk-adjusted return than a traditional lender.  If we didn\u2019t believe that we can offer a better product, why would we build Maker? ",

While it\u2019s true that any individual borrower could have posted something similar, they would likely have posted a signal in a form that was less clear, and benefited them specifically, rather than in a way that we can quality control, and ensure does not show favourable terms / processes to any individual borrower. The benefits of us doing it is that we can call out the pros and cons and present the question from a neutral PoV, rather than a borrower presenting it and potentially failing to call out the negative aspects of taking this approach. Given the lack of familiarity with Maker\u2019s Governance processes among most borrowers, it\u2019s highly likely that we would have needed to have a great deal of input anyway to make it compliant with the signal process.     monkey.irish:  MIP6 - The current MIP6 process does not require anyone to work through RWF\u2026or CES, PE, Oracles, or any Core Unit (CU).

It allows anyone to get a vote, but the vote doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot in terms of implementation.     monkey.irish:  No Core Unit Assessments - I mean, ok, I\u2019m game. I\u2019d also like to ask the community, which of you will be doing the coding and ensuring the solution will actually work and be secure when deployed?

There are ways to get things moving, however, they come with certain risks and so governance would need to sign-off on them.     monkey.irish:  On a personal appeal level, I\u2019d appreciate a level of transparency of what is truly going on here.   What\u2019s truly going on is that semi-regularly RWA borrowers come to GovAlpha to complain about the onboarding process.

The point is we can\u2019t currently tell them that there is no possibility of a faster process, because the question hasn\u2019t been put to governance.

In our opinion, governance is facilitated by the DAO providing an answer to this question one way or another, so we can point potential borrowers towards that outcome, and they have clarity on their available options.

I appreciate your commentary @LongForWisdom - although I believe it is a difficult task to be impartial and offer a comprehensive view to the community of such a complex topic. Let me be, however, very clear on the passage I just quoted. The RWF Team and the (currently incubated) Lending Oversight Core Units have had a open door policy with any originator. Many, and I hope they will voice their opinion here, have reached out and are currently working with the team. A team that works 15+ hours a day in order to provide support to any counterparty. Those counterparts include the same that, most probably looking at your tags, have come to Governance to complain. Detailed (and documented) analysis and information have been shared with them, as well as a potential path forward - yet with the caveat that they could still go ahead by engaging the community directly without our consultative support (nor our endorsement). Those analysis haven\u2019t yet been shared with the wider community given that the counterparty was given, with extreme professionalism, ability to respond and remedy. An opportunity often not taken by some counterparts that have gone instead on silent mode. It is now evident that this stalling game has been played. Hence, all analysis will be shared with the community and a process of brutal transparency will be adopted from now on to ensure a levelled playing field. Going bak to @monet-supply point on adverse selection, the community should ask itself why a borrower that might have received a very negative opinion (sometimes corroborated by professional third-party support) might force the hand of governance complaining that there is not a way forward. Using a traditional banking analogy, this would be like a borrower asking several 100s of MM to a bank unsuccessfully following a risk assessment, going to the Board of Directors via personal relationship to ask for a grandfathered way to bypass internal controls. Governance, ahead of taking such a powerful stance, could have at least asked for clarity on process and outstanding duties to the CU - something that has not happened. Therefore, yet again, I question the appropriateness of your action. We would have expected more caution from Governance on this topic. And humility, given that I doubt Governance has the required tools to independently assess the merit of extremely complex transactions that have the potential to threaten the existence of the protocol, taking the right for itself to endorse an application without legal, technical, nor risk support. I have personally approached my role as servant of the DAO with extreme respect for everybody involved, even when as a professional I was judging some claims farcical based on my 15-year experience in banking and investing. It appears that my good manners have been used by others to misrepresent situations. We will amend our communication policy accordingly, in order to provide everybody with the visibility of what we have been doing in the background, while maintaining the same professionalism that we want to infuse in the wider community we interact with.

My comments are not directed towards GovAlpha. They are for the community and to ensure I am clear on why and what is truly being proposed.     LongForWisdom:  I wouldn\u2019t classify this as \u2018so critical.\u2019 It isn\u2019t.   Ok maybe \u201ccritical\u201d wasn\u2019t the correct word. This signal is proposing that we remove the involvement of the currently ratified CUs and ask the community to make all decisions (business, legal, technical) for onboarding the collateral in question. Please correct me if I am inaccurate on what the signal is proposing.     LongForWisdom:  The assumption here is that any solution would need to use the on-chain contracts and oracle setup that were developed for existing RWA borrowers.   I\u2019m curious to see how this will work in practice. I haven\u2019t yet seen a piece of collateral be onboarded without risk, UI, coding, review, testing, spell making, and bizdev. I\u2019m still curious on who in the community feels they are more qualified than the current CUs. It\u2019s a question that is still outstanding for me. If we want to bypass the current process then we believe there are others that are more qualified to make these decisions?? Ok, PLEASE come forward. Also, are we thinking about collateral management and how to objectively offboard one or more of these collaterals if they don\u2019t work? Part of the RWA questions in the MIP6 will be used to to build some objective measures to effectively assess collateral. Without these, we\u2019ll be right back in this situation and debating the process for collateral management or offboarding (if applicable).     LongForWisdom:  RWA borrowers come to us and tell us they\u2019re unsatisfied with the current governance process   For me, the lack of transparency is concerning. Would this group come forward and share with the community on why this is a better process and what is not happening now? Would someone list which collaterals we would like to use this fast track process on? A lot has been discussed in private and I think the community deserves to understand more of the specifics. I am also willing to change my vote if I can understand who is doing what and how to minimize our risk by fast tracking collateral. After all, once code is deployed/executed and Dai is drawn, the CUs will have to maintain it so it\u2019s not as clear cut as one might believe. ",

Aside from the credit risk, I will add a couple of other thoughts I had upon reading the post. I\u2019m not sure how many individual parties are being considered for this fast-track process, but given RWA are unique and generally highly complex in nature, would that not create quite a lot of work for the protocol anyway given the steps laid out under \u2018Fast Track Process Requirements\u2019? I.e. ultimately detracting from the work which RWF is doing on Centrifuge. Furthermore, what is the \u2018exact\u2019 framework for how this will be assessed? I personally don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to create a low-risk, condensed framework to onboard real world assets, however the post omits crucial details and without these there won\u2019t be any meaningful buy-in from the protocol. I think above all, the goal should be to protect Maker, and not to be reactive and appease clients. A robust framework is therefore required before other real world collateral can be onboarded. ",

I think the pressure here is two-fold: (1) potential RWA collateral providers want movement on their applications, whatever the ultimate result is, and (2) MKR voters want the chance to vote. If CUs think a project has made \u201cfarcical\u201d claims, we want to see the reports you write, read them, hear your points of view, question the collateral provider, discuss in the forums and then decide. And if you all think a collateral type or potential partner is trash, great!! That will be helpful when I\u2019m pushing the Yes/No button on the governance poll, for sure. FWIW, I enjoy the review process and have involved myself where I thought it would be helpful for the group (for example, look through my history of commenting on Centrifuge and Deco). Anyway, for Maker to function and truly be a crowd-operated financial tool/primitive for creating liquidity, MKR holders have to be the decision-makers and bear the fruits, be they sweet or bitter, of those efforts. I commend Long and Prose for being sensitive to all the parties involved here, doing so politely and respectfully (as always) and trying to facilitate an avenue that respects MKR holders and prevents their disenfranchisement.

If this parallel in the real world came to even realise, members of such a Board of Directors would be under serious scrutiny either by their regulator (through auditors) or through the shareholders of such a banking player.

I feel we are entering into the managerial revolution which hand is quite visible in this thread. MakerDAO is governed by governance processes which make MKR holders the only decision-maker on MIPs. We should respect those rules or write a MIP to change them. Anyone can propose a MIP or a Signal Request and no one should discourage that no matter their feeling on the proposal. And the discussion should be here in the open and not behind closed doors. That\u2019s the core foundation of a trustless decentralized protocol. MKR holders/delegates can decide what they want and, if they agree on a proposal that didn\u2019t pass CU gating, it\u2019s their right. That\u2019s my understanding of the MIPs. The governance powers of Facilitators are in MIP41c2. There is no decision-making delegation. I say that as having been fired by the main MKR holder on the belief that I would block those same Asset Originators that are complaining of being stonewalled now. I reckon I would not have shut up.

The CU has worked closely and fairly with every actor, leaving anyone freedom to proceed on the course of action they see fit. With the same actors, the CU has expressed the intention to keep ongoing consultations private, in order to give them the ability to amend and improve, if willing, ahead of a proposal to governance. Such behaviour is customary given the staged approach of any deal. It is now evident that such discretion hasn\u2019t been perceived for what it was by the community, and has been used by some counterparty as a tool.

                    "content": "We\u2019re Robinland, an applicant who submitted a MIP6 proposal in Nov 2021 and passed the community greenlight poll on Jan 24. We voted \u2018no\u2019 and would like to share our perspectives:   Real World Asset on chain requires a combination of deep legal & crypto expertise and industry specific knowledge and experience. Take the real estate industry as an example, debt vs equity, senior vs junior vs preferred vs common, different geographic locations, etc.etc. are all different. It takes years of experience to be able to source and select the right projects, and structure the deal in a correct manner, and monitor the loan performance using the right metrics, etc. to ensure the stability of the asset. Without a proper due diligence process it\u2019s hard to tell apart those with the expertise and those without. The reason why Robinland is doing this is precisely because we\u2019ve seen lots of other start-ups who attempted to bridge the gap between RWA and DeFi but simply lack the industry expertise and ended up onboarding adversely selected assets. We are hoping to be the first one to set the industry standard for how RWA on-chain should be done, but in order to get there, we need to have lenders (such as Maker) who can tell apart borrowers with and without the expertise   The reason why there are cycles in the traditional financing sector is very much due to changes in regulatory environments. Usually a cycle starts by players in the financial system asking for more lenient regulations to conduct a wider range of financial activities and financial innovations, which plant seeds for systemic risks, which are then fermented over a period of time and eventually they burst into a crisis when a certain triggering event occurs. The 1929 crisis and the 2008 crisis all follow this recipe. The underlying logic of the financial system in DeFi is similar. Regulation is key to circumventing outsized crisis that brings down the whole system. But of course, regulations that are too stringent will limit financial activities and also have adverse effect on adoption. The regulators have to strike a balance by putting forth the right set of guidelines. From an outsider perspective, I think this is precisely what the RWF Core Unit is trying to do - to set up a reasonable set of regulations/guidelines to lay a solid foundation to allow for responsible lending activities to ensure the stability of the ecosystem.   As an applicant we are also frustrated when, after we passed the Greenlight poll, learnt that we need to go through the whole process again under the new framework \u201cMethodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions\u201d, and we\u2019ve been working on revamping our application according to this new set of guideline ever since, and are still working on it. From a pure individual perspective, of course we\u2019d prefer to get the financing as fast as possible. But the reason why we\u2019re voting no is that we\u2019re looking at the big picture and the long haul: if the bar is lowered, then Maker will become the last resort of financing for those who cannot get lending elsewhere. Eventually this will jeopardize the stability of DAI and Maker\u2019s position as supplier of the only decentralized and widely used stablecoin, which will eventually hurt borrowers.   The reason why we started Robinland is because we believe RWA can help stabilize DeFi lenders\u2019 collateral pools by bringing assets that are less volatile than crypto and which presents volatility that\u2019s orthogonal to that of crypto. But this is based on the assumption that the type of asset being bridged in are the high-quality investment-grade ones. In order to ensure this, Maker will need to onboard Arrangers who have the industry expertise and knowhow to distinguish between better and worse types of asset, and have the necessary legal structure and processes to protect Maker\u2019s interest. This is why even though the process is not the most pleasant from an applicant perspective, we\u2019ve decided to vote \u2018no\u2019 to this signal request because we believe what the core risk units are doing is for the better of the entire ecosystem, which eventually is to the benefit of both Maker and qualified borrowers in the long run.

If we fast track an approval process without any significant information on legal, tech, and credit, we pretty much do not have a hypothesis we are testing. Hence, would the test be successful (i.e. we don\u2019t lose money) or not, we wouldn\u2019t retain any useful information from it. Betting on red/black doesn\u2019t carry any useful information, independently on whether it\u2019s red or black. In addition, it is evident how some of the borrowers supporting the fast tracking aren\u2019t interested in a 1m DC test, but in approval requiring c. 500M or more, making the uninformed bet an existential threat for the protocol, with an upside capped at very low level. Balancing prudence and effectiveness is difficult. The new RWF team has been in place for 6 weeks, with me personally supporting on the sideline - although yet not incubated. I would give the team a bit of time before judging whether we are erring on the side of prudence. ",

As background, we are working with all these core units and coming through with two quality deals shortly. We look forward to working through an expeditious and thorough process. Oasis Pro is excited to be working with Maker\u2019s delegates and units and their legal, credit and other facilitators and representatives and we see positive signs in mutually seeking to build long-standing relationships with MakerDAO\u2019s Real World Finance Core Unit, Delegates, Legal, Governance, Growth Core Unit, CES, Protocol Engineering, etc\u2026  Oasis Pro is a strong supporter of Maker\u2019s ecosystem and focus on real world assets. OPI\u2019s interactions with legal, credit (RWF) and other facilitators (such as Monetalis as an arranger/structurer) and representatives from Growth, Delegates, etc. have all been positive in the short time that we have been working together on the first two Oasis Pro opportunities. Maker\u2019s facilitators and representatives have been very helpful and assisted us with understanding the developing RWA process better, structuring viable RWA proposals and understanding the scope of information that Maker requires to review and facilitate RWA transactions. As stretched as they are, Maker\u2019s legal, credit, governance, delegates and other facilitators and representatives have been generous with their time. Oasis Pro team members only have had good things to say about their interactions with Maker\u2019s facilitators and representatives. We continue to be impressed by their professionalism as well as their willingness to collaborate and provide guidance and feedback. Oasis Pro looks forward to continuing its work with all the core units and their legal, credit and other facilitators and representatives. We are confident that we are building a solid foundation for mutually beneficial and long-standing relationships which of course is tied to making the Maker ecosystem very successful in terms of rwa, growth and utilizing our subsidiary, OPM, as a listing venue. Many thanks for reading The Oasis Pro Team ",
