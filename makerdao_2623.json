                    "content": "Hi MakerDAO community, My name is Graeme Barnes, I\u2019m a product manager at Gnosis working on prediction markets. I\u2019ve made a few markets about MakerDAO, and I\u2019d like to share the theory behind what I\u2019m doing, the results so far and where it could go. First off, why am I making prediction markets about MakerDAO governance? When running Sight.pm\u2019s beta we created a market regarding MakerDAO\u2019s stability fee. These markets could only be accessed by a small group of traders that passed the hellish KYC requirements. During a user interview with a beta trader, we learned that the trader would attend MKR governance calls to inform his decision to buy or sell an outcome regarding the stability fee. We ran a few other markets regarding governance, ETH2.0 deadlines or DEX volumes and what we noticed, and perhaps this is obvious in retrospect, is that traders would do serious research before making a trade. The insight here was that attention follows money. The hypothesis is that If I create a market, the question the market poses will receive attention relative to the amount one could profit from it. I.e More money to be potentially made equals more attention. The MakerDAO and soon other decentralized governance protocols markets are my way to test the hypothesis. What happened on the MakerDAO markets? I chose three MakerDAO markets about the MIP9 polls. I chose markets asking if the following collateral would be greenlit for onboarding:  \u2192 Houbi BTC - Omen  \u2192 Binance USD  - Omen  \u2192 Uniswap V2 ETH-DAI liquidity token - Omen I went with these three because of the discussion on the thread and frankly my interest in these tokens being used as collateral. Each market started on 50/50 odds funded with 1 000 DAI as liquidity. I set the 50/50 odds because I didn\u2019t have an understanding of where the odds should be placed given the initial trading that had taken place. Post launch people have traded on each of these markets (despite hideous GAS fees). In all cases, the odd\u2019s have moved from 50/50 to roughly 80/20 in favour of greenlighting the collateral. Of these the strongest market in favour of greenlighting is the Uniswap V2 Dai-ETH liquidity token which is sitting at 86.8% greenlit, or in other words, people have put at stake 1568 DAI that Uniswap V2 Dai-ETH liquidity token will be greenlit.  Screenshot 2020-08-24 at 15.04.301248\u00d7854 65.4 KB  What\u2019s next? At the moment these Omen markets are quite simple, yes, no type markets. The attention they receive is one whereby the trader needs to figure out not \u201cshould\u201d collateral be prioritized but \u201cif\u201d. The former is not so much about understanding the consequences of the poll but instead how MKR holders will vote. Personally, and where I\u2019d like to take this eventually, is to ask markets that pose the question, \u201cIf UniswapV2 ETH-DAI liquidity token is onboarded as collateral, how much UniswapV2 ETH-DAI liquidity tokens will be used as collateral on a range from 1 000 to 1 000 000 within the first month of been live\u201d. These conditional markets require traders\u2019 attention to be focused on the consequence of a proposal being accepted. I believe that this information could be valuable to decentralized communities to aggregate beliefs about the consequences of proposals and hopefully lead to more informed and better governance decisions. In the meantime expect more basic markets but perhaps with more than 1000 DAI or perhaps MKR. If there is an upcoming proposal which you believe could benefit from attention from inside and outside the Maker community, lemme know, and I\u2019ll do my best to get the market live and funded.

I\u2019d encourage the community to weigh in on how useful you feel this would be. I\u2019m somewhat surprised that these markets are seeing any trading at this stage. I do think the biggest challenge in aligning incentives around these successfully is in correctly wording the market to get the outcome you want. Prediction Markets could be quite useful to Maker, as either incentive mechanisms, prediction mechanisms or both. Thanks for taking the time to write this! I\u2019d be interested to see some more general markets:  How much Dai will there be by <date>? How much Dai will the Maker Protocol make as income by <date>? How much MKR will be burned by <date>?  There are also lots of more specific markets that we could create. I could see it working as an incentive mechanism to resolve certain issues. Something like:  Will the Black Thursday Vault Compensation Plan be approved by <date>?  If any MKR Holder or entity or user hoping for compensation voted an amount of Dai on the \u2018No\u2019 side of this market, and publicised this, it would be a big incentive for people to buy the \u2018Yes\u2019 side and try to make it happen. Potentially the protocol itself could even do this as an executive vote. ",

In my mind this would function as a smart contract on top of whatever governance maker is using at any given time. Those voters who choose to participate would be essentially betting a small amount of their MKR that executing an executive (or not executing) will result in a closer DAI peg to $1. These markets would have all of the required tools to exist purely on chain. Honestly the main thing holding me back from exploring this more is the legality of creating a betting market in the United States. Would love to help flesh out prediction markets in maker more though! Here is a rough draft of an MKR futarchy I worked on during an internal maker hackathon https://github.com/andy8052/mkr-futarchy ",

If we don\u2019t have to develop our own prediction markets then we could start using something like this a lot sooner. Omen markets denominated in MKR might work, but that does incentivise keeping MKR outside of the Chief. Perhaps Omen markets denominated in the Chief\u2019s IOU tokens? I\u2019m not sure how comfortable I\u2019d personally be in participating in markets directly related to the Dai price. It seems to be largely driven by liquidity mining at the moment. ",

I was initially thinking of posting a forum thread to ask for suggestions around markets related to the plan. However, after reading the threads and seeing just how much work has gone into the proposal from @monet-supply and others, as well as some of the mudslinging that has gone on, I don\u2019t feel comfortable creating and funding a market without community backing or consent. If you are open to trying something out, if yourself, @monet-supply or another community member who has been working on the plan, create a market on Omen, I\u2019d be more than happy to fund it if it may assist or bring attention to the Black Thursday compensation plan.

Prediction markets make me a little uncomfortable, because it could create exogenous financial rewards and misalign incentives. Example of the black mirror-esque future I\u2019m envisioning: someone creates a prediction market on the outcome of a governance vote with a very low prospect of passing (e.g. increasing the base rate while DAI is above the $1 peg). They then post deep limit orders for \u201cno increase in base rate\u201d outside of the market implied probability. This essentially becomes a bounty that large MKR holders can collect by filling the prediction market order and voting for a rate increase. The prediction market creator could then cash out via derivatives on interest rates, leveraged long positions in DAI/USDC, etc. MKR voting is like an illiquid market. Listing derivatives of illiquid markets creates risk of market manipulation (moving the \u201cspot market\u201d eg vote results in order to profit from a move in the derivative market). ",

For example the markets on MIP 9 which were predicting the poll green-lighting collateral at roughly 80%. A selfish MKR holder could buy the No side of the market, vote No on the MIP poll with enough MKR  to change the outcome and profit about 3 000 DAI. That said, with the means to profit through other financial instruments, how much would a prediction market contribute to incentivising negative behaviour? With more liquidity on derivates products, the profit/bounty one could collect on a prediction market would be the cherry on the top, not the entire desert? ",
