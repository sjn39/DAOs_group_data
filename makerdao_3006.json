On last week\u2019s episode of the \u201cPomp Podcast\u201d \u2013 the Co-Founder and President of Anchorage, Diogo Monica, stated the following: \u201cWe have clients everywhere from crypto funds. so, some of the largest crypto funds. Think folks like Paradigm, Polychain, A16Z Crypto, all the way to very large institutions like Visa.\u201d When ask how Anchorage clients participate in DeFi? \u201cIn fact, institutions thru Anchorage can interact with DeFi, and do. In many different ways. For example, Governance decisions on Maker, Governance Decisions on CELO, they vote directly thru Anchorage. With the same safety we have for their assets.\u201d Hence, many of us have wonder if there is participations by Community Members like A16Z, Polychain, Paradigm, etc.,\u2014and the truth is they are. They just do it differently than most of us. And they don\u2019t post their opinions like we do. And they have their reasons for doing it in this fashion. All in all, I really do believe that We all have the same mission. With that in mind, let\u2019s start giving these  the benefit of the doubt. ",

But yea, looks like A16Z has been inactive. Although they have funded both Celo and of course, Maker\u2013plus Polychain. If I had to guess\u2013could be because of regulatory reasons? Not sure. Or, maybe they just want the Community to develop the protocol on our own. Which is cool with me\u2026 prob not cool with some. What can you do\u2026 ",
