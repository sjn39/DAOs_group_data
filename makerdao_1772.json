I would challenge any CU in similar situation with lack of clear budget oversight and breakdown. And I even voted against Growth team while was there based on core values.

As for the logic behind voting in favor of the current proposal over the next? Is there a rush? I was looking forward to enjoying my last meal!   But, joking aside\u2026 I respect your decision. All is well : ) When we meet up next time in Europe, or maybe even Latam? We\u2019ll hug it out   ",
