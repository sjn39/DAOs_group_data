Additionally there are another six or so applications that are pending community greenlight. It seems that we may soon find ourself in a situation where the foundation will have a large backlog of potential collateral to evaluate and greenlight. I wonder if process changes are needed to ensure that the domain teams can focus attention on collateral applications that maker holders view as having the most potential for ecosystem impact. One potential solution to this problem might be to have a regular governance poll that goes out to determine which collateral application is a top priority for maker holders. This way the domain teams can be sure to focus their efforts on those applications first. I would suggest that we add a regular possibly semi-weekly or monthly poll where we ask maker holders via a ranked choice poll to determine what is the highest priority community-greenlit application to onboard next. Having a ranked choice poll should hopefully also give us some signal into what is the second and possibly 3rd most important collateral applications as well. Will add a poll to judge if people are in favor of this idea. Let me know what you think in the comments! Are you in favor of adding an additional governance poll to prioritize collateral applications?     yes no abstain     0 voters     If people are in favor i will add some additional polls to hopefully determine what might be the appropriate interval to poll MKR holders.

Basically i think codifying the rules for \u201cwhat is the most impactful token\u201d is going to be a pretty complicated exercise and likely would result in picking a few metrics that don\u2019t really take in to account everything that should be considered. I don\u2019t really have a solve for the fact that MKR whales might have conflicts of interest. Seems like the a risk that might just need to be accepted with plutocratic voting systems, but definitely something worth considering here. ",

                    "content": "Some points in response to this thread: Community Greenlight Polls The community greenlight polls already achieve the goal of providing rough prioritisation for the domain teams. The greenlight polls produce scores that can be used as one way to rank the potential collateral assets. Directing Domain Teams As it stands, domain teams are specifically not required to work on the collateral that MKR Holders most want them to work on (at least at this stage where they are not being paid by the protocol.) Community sentiment towards an asset is meant to be one of the inputs into their decision of what to work on, but not the only input. There are three reasons we made this decision when writing the collateral on-boarding process (which the collateral onboarding MIPs are ultimately based on).  The domain teams have a much better understanding of the risks and ease-of-onboarding within their domain. This lets them prioritise more sensibly to achieve maximum throughput. In the current state of affairs the Maker Foundation pays the domain teams salary, realistically this gives them control of what the domain teams work on, and you can\u2019t hand-wave this away regardless of what you write in a MIP. Asking people to work on things they don\u2019t believe in is a bad idea. It hurts morale, and you end up with work of a lower quality. In the future there is also the possibility of multiple teams within a single domain that have different specialisations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to force a team to work on something they have no experience with.  Repeating Community Greenlight Polls The most recent amendment to MIP9 changes how repeating polls works to some extent. The previous version was somewhat ambiguous. The new amendment gives the governance facilitators leeway to repeat greenlight polls if there is community demand to do so. This was viewed as a compromise between \u2018Repeat all the failed polls every month\u2019 and \u2018never repeat the failed polls\u2019, and allows us to keep a lid on the number of greenlight polls happening at once. On the current approach The current approach is not \u2018first come first served.\u2019 The current approach leaves the decision up to the domain teams as to what they work on each month. ",

Some interesting points regarding \u201cDirecting Domain Teams.\u201d     LongForWisdom:  The greenlight polls produce scores that can be used as one way to rank the potential collateral assets.   Care to elaborate here? Just thinking about it I could see a few potential problems with trying to infer priority based on the greenlight polls. It seems like any inference that you make is going to be heavily skewed based on voter turnout on a given week and would potentially suffer from the problem described by @Adam_Skrodzki here:    Why aren't MKR Holders voting?   As a minor MKR holder who currently do not vote and voted in a past I can say what my reasoning for not voting is.  I generally agree with decision current governance is making    I.E why vote on the greenlight poll for say LINK when it is already clear that it is going to pass? Ultimately, it just seems to me that as long as we ask one question to infer a different one we stand to make the wrong inference, so given that we have the facilities to ask this question directly why wouldn\u2019t we just do that?

One speculative hypothesis I have for LRC being rejected was because it was deemed less important than other collateral types (I don\u2019t have evidence for this).  Additionally, it seems like onboarding a wBTC alternative (like renBTC) is more dire than adding other ERC-20s that are being worked on right now. A forum poll would be the preferred method IMO, as we don\u2019t have to make it binding, but just get a general pulse on what people think is important.
