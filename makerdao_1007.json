Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by Monetalis Group Community Q&A   Resources  [Forum Post] Monetalis Evolution   Our approach to DeFi/TradFi integration is to focus on scaling volumes fast using a solid integration point that requires limited changes to the day-to-day business of both TradFi/DeFi. We do believe the end-state is a thorough on-chain integration between TradFi and DeFi, but we do think it is day-to-day large volumes of capital interactions that will drive this on-chain integration at a very large scale - going from experimentation to mainstream with institutional asset managers. So first volumes, then growing on-chain integration. \u2026 Monetalis can be seem, logically, as divided into 3 interacting components: ARENA: The Off-chain/On-chain, TradFi/DeFi integration point (underlying in both MIP\u2019s) CLYDESDALE: Integrating financial institutions with DeFi (MIP65) LUSITANO: Onboarding high-quality investment teams onto DeFi (MIP68)   [MIP65] Clydesdale - Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution   MIP65 onboards a RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and invest them in approved bond strategies. This MIP, importantly, also set out strict conditions for the setup of the underlying legal and governance structure and verification requirements.   [MIP68] Lusitano   MIP68 onboards a RWA Vault backed by the assets of a trust arranged by Monetalis. It brings about a RWA structure that can onboard a specific Green Economy SME lending strategy in the UK, but designed to be flexible enough to start as platform for Arranging and executing other lending collateral strategies efficiently.
