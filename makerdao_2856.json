For future reference, below is a visual/written description of the enhancements to be discussed. The Voting Portal (vote.makerdao.com) has three discrete sections; the Landing Page, Polling Page, and Executive Voting Page. Landing Page: The new landing page includes call-to-action labels for a quick overview of what governance actions are available right now. This page also includes jump-off points for easy access to related sources of information like system statistics, community sites, tools and forum discussions: Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 14.19.061436\u00d7987 229 KB The landing page also highlights the most recent executive vote as well as the latest polling votes with the ability to click-through to view all historic polls/proposals: Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 14.19.501437\u00d71081 92.2 KB The latest Governance-specific blogs and posts can also be found on the landing page: Screenshot 2020-10-20 at 14.20.181436\u00d7551 112 KB Polling Page: The polling page has been revamped to allow batched polling. Users can now submit their ranked choice and plurality votes in a single transaction by using the ballot functionality. Other functionality includes filtering and poll card information to support user awareness and participation: New Polling Pg1435\u00d71061 133 KB Executive Voting Page: The executive voting page now also displays past executive proposals and their respective execution dates and amount of MKR still in support . Users are now also able to add comments along with their vote so the community can better understand the rationale behind why people vote a certain way. Exec Page1436\u00d71192 145 KB When clicking into the detail of an executive vote, the user is presented with 3 tabs; Proposal Detail, On-Chain Effects and Comments. Proposal detail includes all detail as included by the Governance Facilitator: Executive Page1005\u00d71033 145 KB On-Chains Effects display the spell address linking out to Etherscan to view the contract code. This is followed by the Vat and Jug changes read from the contract itself:  And finally, the spell comments field, which is an off-chain database of comments signed by users when they submit their vote: Comments Field932\u00d7535 60.2 KB This new Governance Portal will replace the legacy site at vote.makerdao.com. The legacy site will remain active at v1.vote.makerdao.com as there remain outstanding onboarding and ES module functionality that we need to migrate. It will still be possible to continue to vote through this site if users wish. All comments and feedback are welcome as we continue to optimise access to governance information and voter participation. Thank you! ",
