                    "content": "Presently Maker governance is modeled on the role of shareholders in a private company. The MKR token is similar to a share, and with this you are allowed to participate in Maker governance voting, similar to the use of shares during the annual shareholders gathering. This was the theory back when Maker was conceived, but experience has shown us that Maker governance does not correspond to this model. There are two major differences. First difference - tokens have more use cases compared to shares Shares used for voting are registered in a company share registry. You as a shareholder are listed and you vote with your listed shares, but what you actually do with your shares is up to you. This means you may hold or trade your shares and still vote with them, as it is the company share registry that matters, not your Etrade account. MKR tokens are different, there is no registry you vote with what you have in the governance contract. The downside is that since MKR has several other use cases, some of which are quite profitable, this creates a competition for tokens and the token holder\u2019s attention.  Use cases for MKR tokens1280\u00d7720 51.7 KB  In addition to passive holding and governance there is also competition from market making, defi participation and active trading. Holding - just buy and hold. The vast majority of MKR is in this position. Market making - this can be attractive option as the MKR token has a tendency to vary in price from DAI 400 to DAI 800, practically no matter the internal or external circumstances. Mental effort is low, profit quite good. DeFi participation - this option was not even on the drawing board when Maker was conceived. Mental effort is low to medium depending how hard you want to farm. Last time I checked MKR-WETH on Uniswap it had 18.4% annual return. Active trading - nothing beats active trading. Picking up some MKR in the post Black Thursday fire sale and netted a nice 100% profit. The mental effort is however very high. And finally Maker governance - high mental effort, significant weekly workload and 0% annual return. Basically hard work for free. Especially when compared to the DeFi choices available it is basically a small miracle there is any MKR voting. If Maker ever found itself in the situation where the efforts of the founders and one handful of diehards and early investors needed replacement, the entire Maker project could potentially be in danger of abandonment. Second difference - the MKR lifestyle  Real world shareholder vs MKR holder1280\u00d7720 115 KB  In the above table there is a comparison of the respective situation of a shareholder versus a MKR holder. As you may have noticed the only similarity is that none of them are compensated for their effort. The similarities end there, otherwise every aspect of their situation is different. Fully submerged participation in Maker governance is in late 2020 very similar to being on the management team of a startup company. There is enormous energy, vast promise and interesting people, but also the feeling that Hell has fewer fires to put out. I will hereby argue that change is needed. Some notes on this article: This is not a MIP. It is not a pre-MIP or a poll. I am not proposing anything. It is a description of the as-is situation. Feedback appreciated. ",

As someone with double digit quantity of MKR, I used to vote regularly, mostly out of novelty, but have since moved to LP on Uniswap. Economically it serves me better and my votes never really mattered anyways. The gas costs were an issue at times, why would I spend $10 to influence the outcome by .1%? I\u2019m torn, I think there are far too many polling and too many executive votes. In the past I think there would be 20+ polling questions at once. I value the speedy protocol enhancements and decentralization is paramount, but there has to be a better way than this. They can\u2019t all be that important. Adding to this it\u2019s funny that they\u2019ll usually pass with something like 100% of the vote. I would like to see: economic incentives for voting. Particularly for voters who voted correctly (whichever side wins). Maybe it\u2019s as low as covering the gas cost, and maybe your votes cast has to be over a threshold of MKR (>1?) to make dust voting gas reimbursement attacks more difficult though it would still be a consideration. Some sort of economic incentive, to turn it into more of a game. ",

I have been working for quite some time on work-rewards and how to couple this into voting power.  I don\u2019t have time to work up a diagram but basically it is a equilateral triangle with work in one corner, vote in another, and reward in yet another. So to me your chart would be more of a 3-dimensional object where my work is your  your mental effort \u2014 work = human hours * value of that hour as a cost your profit \u2013 reward = monetary and/or investment value  and the part in my triangle or 3rd axis that shares the same axis as mental effort in your diagram  ??  \u2013 vote - a combination of \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 that yields a \u2018say so\u2019 metric in the DAO.  In my own thinking on this \u2018work\u2019 as a time component encompasses voting as well as many other \u2018activities\u2019 - voting as a \u2018kind of cred\u2019 stands off on it\u2019s own axis.   But while I have some clean possibly very new directions for Tokenomics.     Aaron_Bartsch:  Looks like we\u2019re finally rounding the corner on new tokenomic/incentive ideas.   I am still pounding out my own version of this change as I have been working on ideas in this realm for more than 1/2 my life without success as of yet.   I believe we are very close to the next transition and agree with @Planet_X that change is needed. I also agree with:     iammeeoh:  Excellent analysis @Planet_X, continuing your efforts to reach a community consensus about the status of things.   and     g_dip:  I personally believe that this issue is entirely mitigated via vote delegation (delegates will be able to monetize their activities in a variety of ways), and MKR inflation for voting.   I think we will find that delegation is critical to proper alignment of incentives and is probably the easiest way to implement kinds of reward models with vesting components.     hyman:  Particularly for voters who voted correctly (whichever side wins).   I am generally against this as i have seen the same proposed in 1Hive for Aragon court and I believe that when it comes to decision making and particularly adjudication it is more important to fairly considered voting vs. voting that must seek to the majority.  Now is this important to find reward.   Maybe.   But I don\u2019t like the idea of any slashing component to wrong voting.  Just a reward component for right voting.   Honestly mixed on this one point and I believe we can achieve the proper balance of participation reward without having to reward \u2018majority/right participation\u2019.     SebVentures:  For compensation, we have SourceCred.   In my review on DSSChief upgrades I have as a note that participation in sourceCred via forum participation AS WELL as voting critical to what kind of rewards your MKR can get.     thedstrat:  This is really true. It makes most sense for most small time holders to put their MKR into a Uniswap liquidity pool rather than make a small difference in governance.   Absolutely agree.  It is also a bit off-putting for these smaller players to participate here.  Nice to meet you @thedstrat and welcome aboard the Maker forum ship. ",

David_Meister:  in the mid-long term future i expect to see increased delegation and ossification (less liquidity of MKR) of responsibility and roles as the protocol scales up, and also more active measures taken against MKR holders who are playing fast and loose with their responsibilities from the MKR holders who are more dedicated   For sure\u2013this is a long-term game we are playing here.

I\u2019m envisioning something like this: I advertise myself as a potential protocol governor and invite MKR delegations. For my service I would charge a yearly fee of say 10bp accrued every month as my salary. So if I receive 1000MKR in delegations, I would receive 1000*0.001=1 MKR per year in salary. That fee would be freely choosable and subject to competition, where as a delegator I would look for the most governance performance per fee. I for one would be happy to delegate my MKR with a nice fee to someone like @Hasu if that would lure them into becoming active governors of the protocol\u2026  ",

Suppose there is a large vote delegatee who issues tokens against delegated votes \u2013 all of those are fungible. They have a price, they can be lent, used as collateral, etc. So you get part of MKR available as \u201calready-voted\u201d tokens, but in a form more fungible than the voting receipts that already exist. People could delegate their vote and still get economic benefit from the underlying MKR ownership. ",

In their system you can store your tez in a ledger and assign your delegate from there.  You do not have to ship it off to a smart contract.  Nothing against smart contracts except I if you are a whale right?  I mean there is a certain amount of money that probably no one is comfortable sending to a smart contract (varies for everyone) but if you can keep control of your funds and delegate that is a different story.  Tezos gets 80% participation through a combination of delegated voting and self voting. ",

Also as a non-technical person there is further risk that I may make a mistake (not even the smart contract). Incentives are everything in crypto.  This stuff has to work due to economic incentives (including voting for whatever) or it doesn\u2019t work at all Also, I own roughly the same dollar amount of MRK and Tezos.  But because delegated voting on Tezos is so easy I have voted in every Tezos vote.  And because Maker has smart contract and custody and digging funds out of the sock drawer risk I have never voted on Maker! Also so far voting on Maker has been working fine in terms of choices \u2013 it is just participation has been low (which I realize could be a threat vector).  I guess what I am saying is that there hasn\u2019t really been a huge call to arms moment.  I probably would participate in that (gulp). ",
