But the Paper is still pretty cool because it is quite neutral and highly focused on stablecoins mechanisms and the use cases, some points are very interesting. And DAI is mentioned server times for public algorithmic stablecoins. Some interesting points. Just as DeFi can provide more inclusion in the financial system, the negative points such as hacks, smart contracts risks, etc. are also clearly recognized at present, should DeFi out grow them the authors see that financial products can be tokenized with stablecoins and DeFi with stablecoins can play a central role in this, which is a key growth driver for stablecoins. The authors of this paper even know about the [Security Tokens Refinancing] MIP6 Application for OFH Tokens it is mentioned in a footer. The paper then describes further growth potentials for stablecoins such as tokenization and innovation drivers for WEB 3.0, for example. In the paper the PEG is mentioned, unfortunately DAI is not mentioned in this section, maybe we should send a mail to the authors. However, the events of Black Thursday are mentioned, the authors see here that the stablecoins were a kind of safe haven which is true, but maybe do not know, that a major point such as fear on chain liquidation rushing into stablecoins no matter what to prevent the liquidation also played a role or were not mentioned for other reasons. The last and largest section, the potential impact of stablecoins on credit intermediation, is mainly about reserve-backed stablecoins because they currently have the greatest market dominance and the closest tie to financial institutions. It is refreshing to read something neutral with facts.   federalreserve.gov    ifdp1334.pdf 1206.63 KB      ",

Also\u2014seems like \u201da two-tiered banking system can support both stablecoin issuance and maintain traditional forms of credit creation\u201d is an indication that they want stablecoin issuers to become banks?

Let\u2019s quote Bill Gates \u201cthe world needs banking but it does not need banks\u201d. But yes I doubt that the FED has an interest in opening up the banking system, I understand it more as a co existence. I think you have to distinguish, it is not the opinion of the FED but of two scientists. It is already somewhere in the framework of the FED so maybe this paper will already have an influence at the FED. I don\u2019t think the Fed has the authority to determine who is a bank and who is not, this has to come from the government side. But it feels like the FED is more on the innovation side than the current US government. ",

                    "content": "To build on this, The President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency collaborated on another report, the \u201cReport on Stablecoins,\u201d which came across as similarly neutral but also mainly focused on reserve-backed stablecoins. It broadly covered stablecoin activities and risks, concluding with these legislative recommendations (for stablecoin issuers): (1) Appropriate risk-management standards for money laundering, terrorist financing, and protecting end users.  - I believe MakerDAO is taking care of this in their own interest. (2) Examination and enforcement authority to certain agencies over stablecoin activities - Maker protocol is such that stablecoin activities are inherently transparent. (3) Limit stablecoin issuance, redemption and maintenance of reserve assets to entities that are \u201cinsured depository institutions\u201d\u2026defined as offering an insured guarantee to redeem US dollars to the customer and limiting riskiness of the balance sheet - I believe MakerDAO\u2019s risk core unit manages the latter, but as for the redemption guarantee, that might become a challenge due to having mostly non-USD reserves. As of now there exist no standards regarding the composition of stablecoin reserve assets. Generally, the liquidation ratios take this idea into account. (4) Limit stablecoin issuers\u2019 affiliation with commercial entities - Again, I believe MakerDAO achieves this in their own interest. (5) Interoperability among stablecoins, or between stablecoins and other payment instruments - DAI is traded across virtually all centralized digital asset exchanges. So basically, MakerDAO is in a pretty good spot right now and looking forward when it comes to compliance! Let me know if I missed anything or if you have any comments about either report. ",

Because of the nature of decentralized stablecoins, do you believe that their should be two (2) frameworks for dealing with reserves stablecoins versus \u201ccollateralized/asset-backed\u201d stablecoins? And as you mentioned\u2014\u201cnon-USD reserves\u201d\u2014how should Regulators view each vehicle when it comes to protecting consumers?

I would have to agree with this sentiment, and applaud the analogy to Instagram. Governments will definitely need two or more frameworks for dealing with stablecoin reserves and collateralization. But DAI makes up too significant an amount of stablecoin market capitalization and has been around too long for governments to dismiss algorithmic/asset-backed stablecoins outright. Take a look at these two graphs that were in the Report on Stablecoins, and you\u2019ll see that the agencies recognize DAI among the top stablecoins in circulation.  1241\u00d7848 190 KB   1351\u00d7816 165 KB  Even if the Maker Protocol fails to return its users their collateral in a large-scale catastrophic event, legislation such as certain emergency liquidity requirements could be created, instead of a strict one-to-one USD to stablecoin backing requirement.
