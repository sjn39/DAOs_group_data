My name is Juan and I am the Facilitator of the Sustainable Ecocystem Scaling CU. Today we are discovering another one of our MIPs in session KYM#10. We will be speaking about MIP58, which is the RWA Foundations with S\u00e9bastien Derivaux. For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.   Discussion & Questions  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux 00:55  Front1435\u00d7804 44.5 KB   Motivation1440\u00d7716 83.7 KB   WhyCaymanFoundation?1440\u00d7717 89.9 KB   Diagram1440\u00d7734 72.6 KB   HowCaymanFoundationWorks?1438\u00d7730 83.8 KB   DAOResolution&amp;Notice1440\u00d7733 104 KB   Committee&amp;AuthorizedSigners1440\u00d7748 91.3 KB  24:40 - Frank Cruz: Is the Foundation looking to take a percentage of the net profits and give them back to the Cayman Islands community? 25:55 - Frank Cruz: What is the biggest challenge for the RWA Foundation, being the first ever blockchain RWF Foundation in the Cayman Islands? 27:17 - Frank Cruz: Regarding the directors, do they need to be experts in this ecosystem? Can you delegate your powers as a director?  Why is it safe?1433\u00d7694 59 KB   Example1436\u00d7732 82.4 KB  38:28 - Payton Rose: Since the other Cayman structure that we have been presented with is a 6S trust structure, can you highlight the benefits of going through this one and the differences between them? 43:08 - Someone (from chat): Is there any examples of large entities like this even outside crypto? 45:03 - Payton Rose: Are there physical considerations for this setup? Do we have a ballpark on how much it costs every time we want to spin up a new side entity or account? 49:01 - Frank Cruz: Are you going to implement any internal controls with regards to managing internally how this Dai is being moved and lent out, and the SPVs interacting with the smart contract? 51:03 - Frank Cruz: Do you know if any of these use insurance policies to cover against misbehavior or anything that could go wrong? 52:04 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Speaking about decisions, how will the DAO give a mandate or a resolution? How do we make sure that the DAO is actually saying what they want and what if we get a very pasive DAO? 56:10 - Planet_X (from chat): Is the loan servicer the same as a bank? 56:40 - Brett Lyons: Does the loan servicer have control on principal and interest repayments from the borrower? Does it go to a bank account that is controlled by an independent loan servicer or does it typically go to the asset originator and there is a risk of the misappropriation of the cash?  Closing Comment  Outro 57:57  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: If you have any question please go to the forum and we will answer! Payton Rose: Thank you for putting this together!
