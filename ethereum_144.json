Have you looked at EIP-1132? Creating and returning an entire array of MintMetadata might be gas intensive. Would a length function plus a get-at-index function be better? I\u2019m not a huge fan of calling the metadata \u201cmints\u201d. To borrow some terminology from established finance, maybe you could go with a VestingCliff or something similar?  ",

The idea isn\u2019t to prevent the transfer of some EIP-20 token for X amount of time, but rather to conceptually separate \u201cimmature tokens\u201d from \u201cmature tokens\u201d where \u201cmature tokens\u201d have some utility that the \u201cimmature tokens\u201d don\u2019t? If my new understanding is correct, perhaps this is better suited as an EIP-1155 family of tokens, where the fungible tokens are tracked at id 0x0, and each mint is a 1-of-1 token with its own metadata and transfer rules?
