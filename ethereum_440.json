The scope of this standard is being kept as narrow as possible to avoid restricting potential use-cases of this base security token. Any additional functionality and limitations not defined in this standard may be enforced on per-project basis. Please check out the EIP\u2019s motivation section, which explains why we decided to invest the time and resources to publish something like that. We aim to fix the minimal set of features that each security token should have, so companies could start adopting it soon. We don\u2019t agree that defining function names (i.e. establishing the technical part) requires a significant marketing effort. Any questions are welcome!  ",

It was my belief then and still now that there is going to need to be broad technical interoperability, as well as regulatory interoperability. To be clear \u2013 I\u2019m just asking for info from you and wanting to have a discussion, as I\u2019ve seen the 4th? 5th? proposal in the last couple of weeks  I\u2019m not working on security tokens anymore and mainly just want to help people create high quality EIPs and work together to grow the ecosystem. Writing up multiple EIPs is the easy part \u2013 documentation, sample code, maybe even code for exchanges to implement is where all the hard part comes in. cc @AdamDossa from 1400 \u2013 any thoughts on working together?

                    "content": "Hi @boris, thanks for your feedback.     boris:  Now that there really are a handful of these \u2013 it would seem that you should all get together to work on improving a standard, rather than just keep publishing new ones?   Each standard that appeared recently comes from a different background, originating from the companies that are formalising their experience in a form of EIP. I see that people agree, that there should be at least 2 ERC for security tokens, one for base and its extensions. So, it\u2019s not just about improvement, it\u2019s about splitting a big requirement into smaller parts, and one of those is ERC-1462, the base.     boris:  I disagree with the whole \u201cmust work with ERC20\u201d. Or rather, the way most of these are (or should be) structured, they can layer on top of ERC20 or ERC777, rather than requiring one or the other.   By providing compatibility with ERC20 and ERC777 interfaces we cover all existing tokens and all future coins. It is about function overriding, as long as we can override their functions the standard is applicable to any token. I put this requirement because ERC-1400 seemed to depend on ERC-777 heavily and I wanted to emphasise the the standard must support both, to be adopted. Could you clarify what \u201clayer on top\u201d means? Is it possible to live without overriding?     boris:  Or, defined in other EIPs, as they are composable and could be optional. Enforcement on a per project basis isn\u2019t really a standard anymore.   This is what I always meant. However, if your token A should not be divisible because the security it represents is not divisible, that\u2019s a project specific enforcement. Some people (EIP-1450) would put it as a general rule. I don\u2019t think such specifics require any EIP.     boris:  But Exchanges are going to need to have upgraded technology regardless. If they can\u2019t move on, then we have a much bigger problem.   The idea of this EIP is to be compatible with both, moreover, to provide guidelines how ti integrate with both, so it won\u2019t force people to step into the future right now. It\u2019s not limiting in any way. I didn\u2019t put ERC-777 into the Simple Description because it\u2019s still a Draft and is not a widely known thing (apart from ERC-20 that is an obvious thing).     boris:  It, along with ERC902 (which is basically your check function as a separate EIP).   It\u2019s not the same thing from perspective of the topic (a good explanation: ERC-1404: Simple Restricted Token Standard \u00b7 Issue #1404 \u00b7 ethereum/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub), but check functions that have been called surely could use an ERC902-based service. Any security token would look like a specific case of ERC902, but that\u2019s where details matter the most, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t spent 1500 words explaining a few simple functions.     boris:  It was my belief then and still now that there is going to need to be broad technical interoperability, as well as regulatory interoperability.   It\u2019s hard to keep regulatory interoperability in the same EIP as the technical interoperability. The regulatory standards are hard to nail down, as there is too much discrepancy between jurisdictions, so it would slow down the adoption of technical part. I\u2019m trying to fix the technical part for now (but keep it extensible), and regulatory interoperability standard may come later.     boris:  Writing up multiple EIPs is the easy part \u2013 documentation, sample code, maybe even code for exchanges to implement is where all the hard part comes in.   As long as writing an EIP is considered an easy task, and the ambiguity of EIP is compensated by providing a ton of sample code and additional documentation (wait, isn\u2019t EIP a documentation?) we will have more and more EIPs coming, trying to fix the hole  ",
