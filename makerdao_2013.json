                    "content": "Following on from the Growth CU monthly update, and with a view to provide more regional granularity for the community, include an overview of some of the recent activity from the APAC region.  HIGHLIGHTS We launched the Binance Card DAI campaign in Argentina in November. The campaign was designed to promote the use of DAI as a payment method in Argentina and customers who used the Binance Card were able to purchase goods and services with DAI at more than 1,000 participating merchants. Binance is now looking to expand the campaign to more countries in the future.   MARKET & STRATEGY OVERVIEW  Regulatory & Competitive Landscape  At the Singapore fintech festival\u2019s Elevandi Insights Forum in early November, MakerDAO discussed how rules and regulations can help power a stablecoin-driven future economy. The discussants include banks, traditional financial institutions, CeFi and governments. The panel discussed the potential of stablecoins to provide financial inclusion, and the need for countries to develop their own digital currencies. Having a presence at the roundtable was beneficial for MakerDAO as it gave us an opportunity to share our expertise on the subject and network with other industry professionals. This can help create more awareness of MakerDAO and the stablecoin-driven future economy, as well as help us develop partnerships and increase our reach.  Strategic Focus  i) CeFi Following the announcement made regarding DSR rate hike, we are reaching out to existing partners who have integrated DSR in the past to re-activate DSR and to new partners to integrate DSR. By taking advantage of the DSR, partners can ensure their Dai is safely managed and their returns are maximized. ii) L1/L2 We are also exploring partnerships with Arbitrum dApp developers to: 1) enable their dApps to use DAI as a payment option, for example, GMX and MUX have integrated DAI ; 2) increase liquidity for DAI on Arbitrum. We are working with dApps to develop a reward program for users who provide DAI liquidity to the pool. And on top of that, we are working a few other exchanges to enable DAI deposit and withdrawal to Arbitrum.  GENERAL UPDATES General integrations from last quarter:   Binance Card   MUX   GMX    Remember that you can stay in touch with us on the #growth-public channel in the MakerDAO official Discord. ",
