                    "content": "In the course of ordinary business, many companies come in contact with \u201cconfidential\u201d information. Being a Lender the in the Credit Tenant Lease space is no different. In addition to reviewing the lease and the financial statements from credit worthy tenants, the financial costs to do a specific projects, or even the personal financial statements from the Borrowers (and their principals), a Lender comes in contact with a litany of confidential information. Further this is information that the Lender must guard and possible use should a foreclosure on a BorrowCo be required. Thus, the next challenge presents itself of how a Lender can engage with MKR with a credit facility agreement and remain in compliance when MKR is a public project with the stated objective of \u201ctransparent\u201d finance? I believe the best path to address this critical concern follows a similar notion to how MKR governance has already had to address \u201cdark fixes\u201d that cannot be made public as they would be exploited. To that end, for any off-chain real-world lender to function, it can only disclose information to parties that are under a similar non-disclosure construct as LendCo itself. Every Lender wants (or should want) to remain fully compliant with its agreements. For a revolving credit facility agreement, LendCo will needs to disclose and demonstrate compliance with the agreement to MKR governance. The conflict comes in how to do so in a confidential way when MKR is public. Enter the \u201cMaker Representative\u201d While this person (or people or legal entity) could be a part of the official \u201cRisk Teams\u201d as an appointed role, this person / people / entity would be nominated by the community to review the required reporting from the RWA lender to provide a report whereby the Maker Representative attests to compliance of the following reporting areas (just to start, not comprehensive)  Independent Financial Statements Delivered No operations outside of approved scope No loans above portfolio threshold issued Equity Requirements for all loans in compliance All loans issued are either performing or under construction  LendCo has certain confidential rights it must retain, but by allowing the MKR community to nominate certain individuals or an entity to an Attestation role (which the community may change at its sole discretion), the community can get comfort that LendCo is and remains in compliance with the credit facility agreement while retaining the confidential nature of the information. Parallel for reference The above is the business version of how classified information from intelligence agencies function in a democratic government. Those agencies routinely disclose their operations / objectives / weaknesses / advantages in both an open and closed setting with elected representatives that are on a select committee specific to receive such information. The public setting is typically quite generic but still informative with the closed setting allowing detailed inspection and oversight. Thus the public (via their elected representatives) know what is going on and have oversight mechanism in place. The proposed Maker Representative would have this oversight role to report and Attest back to community as a whole the status of compliance for a given off-chain lender. Full Disclosure: I am presently advancing a real world assets structure for consideration by the MKR community. Regardless, the points above hold true for any real world assets onboarded correctly and safely. ",

Or even public records in some cases.     mrabino1:  No operations outside of approved scope   Again, the accounting firm doing the books will be in the best position to answer this. Alternatively an external auditor.     mrabino1:  No loans above portfolio threshold issued   Again, a job for the accountant.     mrabino1:  Equity Requirements for all loans in compliance   The company accountant will be in the best position to answer this. Or the auditors.     mrabino1:  All loans issued are either performing or under construction   Yet another job for the accountant unless the task can be automated through software. From the list above I feel the Maker representative function is best served by the company hired to do the financial auditing of LendCo. An auditing firm would also be well acquainted with operating rules for handling confidential information and privacy laws. It is going to be exceedingly hard for a Maker appointed representative to go through in detail what LendCo does unless they have both accounting skills and access to the data. What Maker could do is to provide a standard set of questions to LendCo (in order to prepare the data and be clear about the rules) as well as the financial auditing firm. Subsequently a compliance report is issued by the auditing firm to Maker (paid by LendCo). The report would be part of the data used to determine next years debt ceiling and risk premium for LendCo. This method should satisfy LendCo\u2019s need for confidentiality as they already share data with both the accounting and the auditing firm. The method should also satisfy Maker\u2019s requirement for data regarding use of funds without making the Maker representative a huge and expensive arrangement. As always the best would be to use software feeds for most of this, as the system reaction time would be hugely improved. ",

Further, they require Officer certificates from LendCo attesting to all things being in compliance. For any new revolver, the bank will take the certificates and say \u201cneat, now show me the backup to support those certificates\u201d\u2026 then after some comfort is built up, the bank rarely asks for support. they just rely on the officer certificates (typically for publicly traded companies). In this context, all LendCo financial statements would ALWAYS be generated by an independent accounting firm (not in-house) with an annual audit requirement (audits are only done annually). While I know most all of us have an interest in software, any \u201cfeed\u201d for this information is too exposed to manipulation (in my eyes)\u2026 and for this I am frankly not even thinking of \u201cme\u201d LendCo, but rather the others that come after me. The reliance on audited information and inspections really does need to be done with people. As far as it being exceeding difficult for a Maker rep to go through the data\u2026 this is a point that I dispute\u2026 The reporting requirements should be streamlined enough to allow anyone to review and see that everything is in compliance\u2026 but all support should be readily available for that Rep to deep dive into any given loan to see that everything checks out\u2026 (e.g. a loan was actually provided with the tenant stated)\u2026 Much of this can be accomplished with a combination of a spot inspection during the middle of a cycle and a spot inspection for a deep dive into some loans\u2026 a few things will happen then\u2026 a) the maker rep will learn more about the LendCo biz and what to expect (thus time required in the future drops) b) lendco learns what exact the maker rep typically wants to see and can further customize the reports for his / her consumption.

This is due to A) LendCo only being able to deploy a low number of loans (thus it wont have the portfolio needed to diversify borrowco risk) B) LendCo official reporting will lag (as outlined above). I believe a combination of a spot inspection and higher frequency reporting during the first period will be essential. The above said and for an example only,  one can imagine that after 2 years with no issues\u2026 and an outstanding total loan portfolio of $100MM\u2026 and knowing that the loans are all $2-5MM area\u2026 the risk due to the reporting lag dissipates with scale.

I really like the proposed setup for offchain lenders, it is just that it would be better for all parties involved (LendCo, Maker etc) if the relationship LendCo-Maker could be standardized. It is safer and more reliable for LendCo and it is much more scaleable for Maker.     mrabino1:  a) the maker rep will learn more about the LendCo biz and what to expect (thus time required in the future drops)   Correct. But if the Maker rep quits, is transferred or fired the process starts over.     mrabino1:  b) lendco learns what exact the maker rep typically wants to see and can further customize the reports for his / her consumption.   Yes - but I am quite sure you do not want this situation. It gives way too much subjective power to the Maker representative, it makes the process unpredictable. Example: LendCo is existentially dependent on revolving finance from Maker, with a revolving credit of maybe USD1.0 billion. And now a Maker rep is going to come in and make subjective decisions? Preferably not. I think this comes down to added value. What can a Maker representative bring to the table that a properly instructed external financial auditor cannot? ",

                    "content": "@mrabino1 Thanks for very informative description of how confidentiality is being handled in real world lending facilities. As far as I understand the problem boils out to the fact that some risk related information that may eventually affect all MKR Holders needs to stay confidential. I believe there is decentralized solution to that problem and I\u2019m curious If You can find weak points in it. As I understand DAI generated for LendCo will be distinct asset class with its own risk premium In normal market condition  I expect It will be higher than \u2018decentralized\u2019 one to account for additional risks involved. I suggest we create separate deposit contract where MKR holders can deposit their MKR (or refuse to do so) where withdraws will be significantly delayed. Total market cap of deposited MKR will be a factor taken under consideration in governace over borrow limit of LendCo In case of some LendCo failiure MKR from that deposit are first responsible for covering losses. Under normal circumstances depositors will get part of risk premium as a reward for their work. What part of risk premium goes to depositors should be set by governance and driven by free market forces between values:  Demand of LendCo for capital Total market cap of MKR deposited % of MKR taken from deposit contract to cover bad debt risk  this solution will enable selected, known by name, MKR holders to sign NDA with LendCo and get access to confidential information and make auditing proces well in their own best interest. At the same time it will minimize the risk beared by minor MKR holders who do not have access to confidential information. It will also minimize bureaucracy since there will be very direct link between auditor and financially responsible MKR holder. I\u2019m aware that this idea requires tons of changes in a codebase but I believe that transition from onchain to offchain assets is actually bigger than SCD -> MCD transition and changes to the codebasee are justifed and should be expected. Also I\u2019m aware that what I\u2019m suggesting is just a draft and it is incomplete Several weak points I\u2019m aware of:  It needs to be considered how to enable MKR holders that deposited MKR to be able to vote in governance It needs to be considered If there is free rider problem in that solution and if it is important It need to be considered If there is some long tail risk (auditors hiding bad information in order to avoid being financially responsible untill damage is to big to be hidden) There need to be some limitations in becoming MKR depositor (KYC? minimum deposit? Citizenship?)  But I believe It has several advantages over \u2018dark fix\u2019 approach  It introduce direct financial responsibility for low quality auditing It introduces direct market driven reward system for high quality auditing It limits financial risk for MKR holders that do not have access to confidencial information and because of that they do not have tools to asses the risks correctly  @mrabino1 once again, I would appreciate hearing Your thoughts on that ",

MKR - from voting to staking - part 1 Risk       Staking part 1 - staking to onboard Vault collateral  With the launch of multi collateral Dai, the focus is turning towards onboarding collateral types that can be used for Vaults. In order for the Maker ecosystem to grow there will be an increasing need to onboard more and more collateral types in order to increase the supply of DAI.  Let me be painfully clear about the goal here: DAI is not meant to be a small niche plaything for defi enthusiasts, DAI is to be the leading stablecoin project wi\u2026      It attracted zero interest  I suspect the amount of rewiring necessary is just too much.

If implemented and proven to be functional this idea then can evolve to more general approach including also on-chain assets for a different reasons. I see some value in splitting responsibility for different collaterals to different MKR holders but that is a topic for another discussion. Here my sole intent was to provide solution for confidential information handling. ",

More importantly if Maker truly wants to be the credit facility for the world, somewhat requiring MKR purchases to borrow off-chain (in any capacity) just feels \u201coff\u201d. That said I do there is an aspect to your post that does possibly have legs. For right now and similar to the \u201cdark fix\u201d, having MKR selected representatives (that can be added or removed with MKR governance) seems like the streamlined way to get started. For sure the process with morph with time. ",

I must say I do not understant that sentence. I did not suggest that. What I said is that LendCo would need have guarantors (staking MKR) in order to be able to borrow mint DAI. those guarantors would make auditing job and get paid for it. Secondary lenders (I view LendCo as a proxy same way as commercial banks are proxy for Central Banks ) would not need to be even aware there is any crypto involved. ",
