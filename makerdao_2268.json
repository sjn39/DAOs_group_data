                    "content": "Today I will be going over the various long term features and aspects of Endgame, that will be codified in the Endgame Maker Constitution, which is a document that will initially be appended to the Maker Constitution, and will eventually replace the main text of the Maker Constitution at the moment Endgame is activated and the MetaDAOs are launched. I will be describing each of these features in their own detailed post over the coming weeks, but following up on the topic of the call 2 weeks ago I will just go over each of the high level key features today, to help people prepare for diving further into the content when it is available. Link to the call: Launch Meeting - Zoom  MetaDAOs: Allocators and Facilitators So SubDAOs will change their name back to MetaDAOs, and Creators and Protectors have their classes merged into single collateral deployment class called Allocators. As always the main focus of all MetaDAOs, both Allocators and Facilitators, is the development and maintenance of fully decentralized frontends. A new feature of MetaDAOs is the creation of SubDAOs, a third layer of DAO in the ecosystem that can be created much more rapidly, and with much less restrictions on their parameters, activities and tokenomics.  Removing native vaults and synthetic assets, freeing up the complexity budget One of the biggest upsides of the Endgame design is the ability to outsource most complexity to the MetaDAOs. Synthetic assets, and native vaults, including sharded vault engines, are the two most complex long term features of the old system, and involve massive amounts of recurring work. Eliminating them removes X synthetic assets, each with Y sharded vault engines, which each have Z collateral types onboarded. A huge amount of maintenance and recurring expansion work is saved. Instead this work is outsourced to the Allocators  Focus on AI tools and AI assisted operations As discussed LLMs are at a point where they are a very powerful tool to build out the Scope Frameworks, and make it possible for anyone to analyze reports of projects based on the Scope Frameworks against the requirements defined for them. The same AI tools used to optimize and polish Makers Scope Frameworks can also be used to create entire business models for the MetaDAO and SubDAOs from scratch, and being able to access them can even be a utility of MKR, as a side effect of giving MKR holders this access so they can easily participate in Maker Governance.  L1 and optimistic bridges With native vaults and synthetic assets removed, the main technical focus of Maker Core becomes just focusing on developing and maintaining a home blockchain, that uses optimistic bridges to access all other blockchains, in particular Ethereum. While this sounds difficult, having a native blockchain governed by MKR actually greatly simplifies the problem of emergency shutdown which is currently the biggest challenge to any kind of scalable multichain expansion.  Focus on cross chain bridges and multichain and multimarket Dai liquidity The main recurring work for Maker in the long run should be developing secure, scalable cross chain optimistic bridges from our home hub, and to seed dai liquidity everywhere possible against centralized stablecoins, key decentralized assets, and MKR. This will be a lot of recurring work, but still nowhere close to the level of complexity that we save from not having recurring synthetic assets, sharded vault engines, and collateral onboarding.  Simplification of first wave of endgame tokenomics The timeline to launch MetaDAOs can be sped up significantly following the launch of the Sagittarius Engine, based on a simpler initial tokenomics design that focuses on regular, simple farming, rather than elixir, dss-kiln and economic resilience models  Return of Dai to become a soft-pegged stablecoin, with additional duration features Dai is currently a soft-pegged stablecoin, but this is masked by the gigantic amounts of stablecoins held in the PSMs. Dai is not a centralized stablecoin and it is a liability if we give users the wrong impression. Instead the focus should be on having a large amount of the Dai collateral in the safest assets, such as treasuries, and focus on unique Dai features such as DSR and MetaDAO farming  Rebrand As discussed, alongside a complete reboot of our communications and a large scale marketing and education campaign, we should rebrand the project to focus more on our target userbase outside of deep crypto, and redefine what we mean with unbiased world currency, so there isn\u2019t so much confusion with Dai being different from e.g. Rai or LUSD.

I just had some questions that I think would be helpful for the entire community to get the answers to:   With the sheer complexity of this Endgame Plan, why do you think it\u2019s necessary and advantageous as opposed to the current way of doing things?   Why will it be a good idea to merge Creators and Protectors?   How will the value of native vaults and synthetic assets be easily replaced via Allocators?   Can you say more about the native blockchain?  How will this look and who will be working on it?   Why will seeding dai liquidity be helpful, and why is it no longer important to have synthetic assets, sharded vault engines and collateral onboarding?   Can you explain the DSR and MetaDAO farming you reference?   Can you provide some advice on how to best rebrand (with the point in mind of how Dai is different from Rai or LUSD)?   ",

                    "content": "    rune:  Rebrand As discussed, alongside a complete reboot of our communications and a large scale marketing and education campaign, we should rebrand the project to focus more on our target userbase outside of deep crypto, and redefine what we mean with unbiased world currency, so there isn\u2019t so much confusion with Dai being different from e.g. Rai or LUSD.   My 2 Dais on this:  The timing: Ofc was surprised for this idea. The metaDAO launch is in fact the best moment for a major branding initiative. Fully agree on this.  Rebranding:  building a brand takes decades. Consistency is key, there is no other way about it.  It is a marathon. Rebrading to something that contains USD feels like a \u201cfollower\u201d mentatility instead of a leader mentality. It also doesn\u2019t build on the heritage the protocol has; If daiwanese allowed early protocol devs to understand from principles the banking concepts without bias while allowing for out-of-the-box thinking, then the Dai brand should not bring consumers into the \u201cUSD\u201d brand attributes and psichological framing. Dai \u201cthe USD soft pegged stablecoin\u201d positioning needs to evolve to communicate 2 new benefits: A yielding stable + Unbiassed medium of exhcange. The first benefit (yielding stable) will attract normies, the reason-to-believe is the DSR. The second benefit will harness the sticky OG consumers, the reason-to-believe is the Dai contract and the MKR Governance. MKR, Dai Brands: having a single brand that encompasses both brands has been tried, many big companies (P&G) have a \u201chouse of brands\u201d. P&G has tried doing branding of the P&G brand on their products and above the line on TV during the olympics. The benefits from their products are so varied that targeting branding messages to such diverse audience becomes very irrelevant to the end consumer. Focusing on each brand specifically, and targeting the specific consumers with well positioned Comms messages is more efficient. Target audiences: Maker protocol\u2019s main product is Dai. MakerDAO\u2019s main product is decentralizad governance. These products appeal to different target audiences, hence different strategies are needed. Actors (B2B2C): in the endgame paradigm, there are new actors in the system, but the target audiences remain the same (B2C : normies and OGs, B2B: institutions). Maker requires a B2B2C branding & comms strategy where we serve RWA MetaDAOs (B2B) with Comms and strategies so they serve it to their institutional partners. And B2C message to end consumers using Spark protocol or to payment provider users. Maker has been executing first hand a B2B strategy and supporting partners with B2C communication. This is not a new challenge, we just have new actors in the system which we need to tailor the strategy for.   conclusion I don\u2019t see a major rebranding needed where fully new brand names and logos are required. I see a major strategy update, include new actors, research target audiences (B2B and B2C) and create new assets, new strategy, new Comms which serve the actors and the audiences. All done in a very well orchestrated manner with the MetaDAOs launch. ",
