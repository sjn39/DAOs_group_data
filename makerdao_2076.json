A few comments on the defense fund I would like to add: Self insurance is fully customizable and can be tailor made to meet specific requirements of a decentralized organization like MakerDAO. Hence, it is a suitable risk management instrument for DAOs. This means, anon contributors will be covered by the fund. There will be no KYC requirements for signing up. Self-insurance is compatible with a pseudonymous workforce. Additionally, we will classify beneficiaries in different risk layers. If there is a specific subset of persons with higher risk exposure (i.e. delegates, devs, etc), they will have higher coverage limits. If this proposal is approved, we will talk with all interested parties to understand the risk requirements and clearly define beneficiaries, risk layers and exclusions. ",
