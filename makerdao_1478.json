                    "content": " Request to Poll for Maker teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters In support of MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals 18, Starknet Engineering Core Unit is requesting to poll on the following parameters as part of the weekly governance cycle, which if successful will allow this to proceed to an on-chain vote. The reason for introducing this poll before Fast withdrawals are released on mainnet is that the technical work has been underway for sometime and is known by the community but requires a formal poll to proceed with the defined risk parameters. Completing this formality now will enable Maker to vote on the deployment once it is ready, for which we are targeting end of August.  Parameter Summary SNE-001 (Starknet Engineering Core Unit) is requesting Governance to poll on approving L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, including: Approve the following gateways (domains), as documented in MIP69 19 and the github implementation: Starknet A thorough risk assessment has been undergone and discussed on the forum on this post from PECU and SECU: Fast withdrawals and risk assumptions. Debt Ceiling Parameters:  Set the Starknet Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M Dai Set the Global Debt Ceiling to 3M Dai - as a sum of all debt ceilings for each domain. The current Global Debt Ceiling is set to 2Mn (1Mn for Optimism, and 1Mn for Arbitrum)  Wormhole Fee Parameters per Domain:  Set the Starknet teleport Fee parameter to 0 bps  Approve Oracle Quorum of (13) feeds (see details from the Oracle CU here)  This is the minimum number of feed attestations required to complete a Fast Withdrawal transaction and will be comprised of any of the 25 oracle feeds provided by the Oracles team.   Details:  A conservative 1M Dai debt ceiling for Optimism and Arbitrum domains has been applied. This has been chosen to limit Fast Withdrawal risk and will be increased once the teleport has been upgraded to support oracle hard confirmations and the market has shown demand for greater usage. The current implementation is based on oracle soft confirmations requiring complete trust in the sequencer to include confirmed transactions that burn DAI. PECU and SECU have published a Fast withdrawals risks and asumptions post, explaining the rationale for having the same debt ceiling of 1Mn Dai for Starknet, Optimism, and Arbitrum The wormhole fee is an absolute amount and is levied per domain. This could be upgraded in the future if the need arises. This fee is only applied to fast withdrawals. The slow withdrawals bridge, which requires a 7 day wait will continue to function without fees even if fees are introduced for Fast Withdrawals.  ",

I think those are very relevant questions for any rollups given that most of them only have one sequencer at the moment. The premise of the L2 risk management strategy is that we trust sequencers for the time being, hence companies building the rollups. The bridge limit (for simple bridge) and debt ceiling (for fast withdrawals) should be seen as risk parameters defining \u201cwhat we are ready to put at stake given what we know of the trust assumptions\u201d. Those risk parameters will evolve as the rollup evolve through mechanisms reducing the trust assumptions, and execute their decentralization roadmap. Starkware is a $8Bn company, making revenues from Starkex, but arguably having most of its valuation relying on the Starknet rollup strategy. They are also funding 50/50 the SECU. What is there to gain here is to rug 1Mn DAI (in fact 200k DAI which is the bridge limit), what is there to lose is $Bn and the funding they provided to SECU so far. The bridge limit and fast withdrawals will be increased once we are more comfortable with trust assumptions, specifically with the development of the following features: ability to insert forced transactions from L1 (similarly to the Canonical transaction chain on Optimism), the checkpoint mechanism by which a sequencer commits to the order and the transactions included in the next batch, and sequencer decentralization cc @Primoz @Derek ",

Just want to note that my question isn\u2019t limited to sequencer - it is specifically about a multisig or other admin control that is capable of altering the logic or state of the network.     pyramidmaker:  Starkware is a $8Bn company, making revenues from Starkex, but arguably having most of its valuation relying on the Starknet rollup strategy.

My concerns are not necessarily about the Starkware team rugging. Mistakes happen, as do other forms of attack. If there is a multisig, it can be compromised inadvertantly, or it can be used to comply with a forcible request from a state actor. MKR holders need to understand all possible attack vectors.

More tests won\u2019t solve this problem, rather rollups changing their design and reducing the trust assumptions will. On Starknet side, a checkpoint mechanism (by which the sequencer commits to include a series of transactions in the next batch) and decentralization will reduce the trust assumptions.  Note that in the current implementation of Optimism, Arbitrum, and Starknet, the risk profiles are very similar for all the rollups (see Fast withdrawal risk assessment). The debt ceiling will be increased as the rollups implement their roadmap and reduce the risk for MKR holders.  PECU is planning to release fast withdrawals on mainnet, we are planning to release fast withdrawals on Starknet mainnet 1-2 weeks after that. Starknet mainnet might undergo a state reset before the end of the year, which will happen in parallel with the release of important features (forced transactions, proving false transactions, decentralization roadmap). Hence we will not significantly increase the bridge limit and debt ceiling before then. We will propose a migration path to all users prior to the state reset.  ",

If anyone has the info, please share.   Hey Chris! A pleasure to meet you, Ohad from StarkWare here! The \u201ccore logic of StarkNet\u201d can\u2019t be tempered in subtle ways. StarkWare can\u2019t use its control over the sequencer for inserting invalid transactions and steal money. It can\u2019t roll the state back. This is enforced by STARK proofs, which are the base for scalable self-custodial solutions deployed by us over the last several years The only (theoretical) way to steal DAI from the system is by replacing the L1 core contract. This measure would be very visible to detect, and we usually notify about a few days ahead. The upgrade is done by a cold key, and you will thus have evidence of the tempering and the state before the update that can be used for compensation. This risk is fully detailed in @pyramidmaker risk analysis. ",

Based on this I\u2019m led to believe that there is an EOA that is capable of upgrading the core contract. I believe that admin keys like this one should be treated with the same level of scrutiny as any TradFi bank or institution. So, why should MKR holders trust Starknet\u2019s EOA admin key without any sort of legal agreement with whoever is securing it?

As an example, we started with a really harsh TVL cap on our bridges a few months back - and we increased it very slowly and gradually to be sure we don\u2019t lose more than what is manageable before making more security efforts.

Maker is making a bet on those because the opportunity cost of not going to promising L2s is much higher than staying on L1. The consensus between PECU/SECU/Risk CU is that the way to control for risk is by having tight bridge limits and fast withdrawal debt ceiling. Again, this 1mn DAI limit is in fact 200k DAI limit given that it\u2019s the current simple bridge limit. Given the multi $Bn reputational damage for Starkware of rugging DAI here, it has not felt necessary to setup a legal framework. Rather we have decided to limit the risk until the technical trust assumptions are reduced.  We will only consider raising the risk parameters once trust assumptions improve through e.g., checkpoints, forced L1 transactions, and decentralization. However, always happy to be challenged and I am glad you\u2019re bringing those points up. I will discuss with PECU and Risk CU how we can provide more visibility here. ",
