In addition to our usual update (10/29 - 11/11), we\u2019re also providing details on what we\u2019ve been up to this quarter and what we\u2019re looking forward to in Q1 2023.  Administrative Updates  Attended ETHPortland and NFT.NYC    twitter.com    MakerMegaphone @MakerMegaphone    Big thanks to @themyntlab for hosting ART 3.0 @ NFT NYC!  So cool to see team members from @MakerDAO, @StableNode, @creaticles, @UpshotHQ, and @Chromia under the same roof. \ud83e\udd70 https://t.co/PkCA9GJT7i   3:55 PM - 4 Nov 2021           24                5            ETHPortland and NFT.NYC turned out to be a nice reintroduction to crypto conferences: we got to reconnect with the crypto community, meet most of each other for the first time in real life, and meet members of GovComms and Growth as well. We saw a lot of interest in MakerDAO\u2019s operations and DAOops in general and enthusiasm toward the developments in Real-World Finance and the reduction of Dai\u2019s reliance on USDC and the team had good discussions about our direction and upcoming opportunities.   Obtained business insurance   Obtained legal counsel   We\u2019ve started working with an attorney to help us understand what regulations we may or may not need to worry about with regard to content production. Unfortunately, it took longer than anticipated to get onboarded due to a mix-up with our payment processor but we got things ironed out and had our first meeting this past week. It sounds like the regulations we need to worry about shouldn\u2019t have much of an impact on our existing efforts but we will be asking him to review some of our work on the Community Portal and Explainer Videos to ensure there aren\u2019t any red flags prior to publication.  Content Production Bi-Weekly Update 10/29 - 11/11 Video  Published  [Maker Relay] Monthly Governance Review: October [Maker Relay] The State of Dai (10/26 - 11/1) & (11/2 - 11/8) Post-production, posted Forum at a Glance.

Substack  Maker Relay Ep 69 and Ep 70  The State of Dai Ep 11 and Ep 12     Audio  Created 11 intro songs for various video/audio productions (including future projects) Created 5 background songs to give our educational content a more professional tone. Started working with ElPro on podcast idea \u201cMeet the Makers\u201d  Other  Started discussions on organizing content collection and a side event at ETHDenver. Distributed a commemorative NFT for Rocket.chat - please DM us if you haven\u2019t received one yet! Released and updated the Dai-Curious Dashboard, which details a wide range of high-level MakerDAO financials.   Looking Ahead In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be:  Posting a promo video for Maker Wormhole. Hosting an AMA on Maker Wormhole featuring Sam and Kris from Protocol Engineering. Hosting a meeting with multiple Core Unit contributors/facilitators to discuss plans for ETH Denver. Building a Keeper to better understand and document the process from an inexperienced users perspective.   Quarterly Update  Community Portal Community Portal v2.0 will be ready for launch following a review by our attorney. We\u2019ve rebuilt the existing Portal with a new CMS that\u2019s more scalable and less expensive, removed outdated content in the Learn section and reorganized the remaining content for accessibility, and updated the Resources section to better reflect the current state of MakerDAO.  Explainer Videos Our first explainer video, \u201cHow to Vote in Governance\u201d is also awaiting legal review and is otherwise ready for publication. It\u2019s taken longer than anticipated to get the first video out due to the extra work involved in setting up our scriptwriting, design, and animation processes but getting these in place helps streamline the production of the rest of the explainer videos. We have scripts we\u2019re working on in collaboration with GovAlpha (linked here) at varying stages of completion and several topical scripts covering things like liquidations.  Regular Publications To increase the accessibility our work on Maker Relay (in collaboration with GovComms) and Multi-chain Dai-lights (formerly Dai on Different Networks), we\u2019ve made these updates available via email using Substack; once Community Portal v2.0 launches, we\u2019ll publish these updates on the blog and allow readers to subscribe to as many or few updates as they would like to receive.  Looking Ahead In Q1 2022, we\u2019ll be focusing on:   Collecting content at ETHDenver and organizing a MakerDAO side event. Jerry\u2019s based in Denver and plugged into the local music scene, which means he   Launching the pilot of our Ambassador Program, which will pay contributors from different regions to translate content to and from different languages, manage localized social media channels, and host meetups. The pilot will target Latin America.   Updating content in the Learn section of the Community Portal, adding more Resources as they become available, and testing for usability.   Publishing Explainer Videos, starting with several we\u2019re collaborating on with GovAlpha and moving on to important topics like Liquidations and Collateral Onboarding.    Budget Update After reviewing our accounting for October, it appears we\u2019re more underbudget on salaries than we reported in our most recent budget proposal by about 9000 Dai and our Community Portal fund has been largely unused since the new CMS doesn\u2019t require input from a React dev. We\u2019re currently assessing the cost of the content production efforts we\u2019re proposing for ETHDenver and plan to put up a Signal Request to see whether or not we have the community\u2019s support in reallocating these funds to cover those expenses.
