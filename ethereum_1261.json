Check-sums are nice, but at the end of the day, a lot of people \u201cmake a small transaction, just to see it\u2019s working\u201d, before making a really huge one. A lot can go somewhat wrong on the first transaction between two wallets (picking the wrong network, an unsophisticated malware changing the address on clipboard, copying the wrong address on the first place, etc.) It could be nice if this is replaced by some off-chain protocol that publish the transaction as a notification on the other end, so the person(s) doing it can validate, before submitting. I\u2019m not getting into implementations details because it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d love to hear community  opinion  Of course it\u2019s optional, may be turned off by default. ",
