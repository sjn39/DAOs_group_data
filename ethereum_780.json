In an effort to remain organized and decrease confusion, we\u2019ve decided to begin to catalogue information here. We will update this as new information is added. If there is something we should add (complaints,  concerns, governance, articles, reviews), please post it in the thread! GitHub - Reference Implementation, Specification, and Original Whitepaper This is our original reference implementation. Note that there are other optimized miners contributed by the Ethereum community, and for benchmarking, one of those is more appropriate. GitHub Comments - See Our Replies to Various Issues or Questions This is helpful if you want to stay up-to-date with technical comments we address on GitHub, rather than searching through the various forums. Article: The Problem with Proof of Work Addresses the original problem with specialization, proof-of-work, incentives, and Casper FFG. Note that this article was written ten months ago, and thus some of the statements around Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem are outdated. Article: Performance and Tuning (Spec 0.9.2) This article explains a lot of the inefficiencies with Ethash from a GPU saturation and throughput standpoint, and how ProgPoW addresses those. Article: ProgPoW FAQ This article addresses some of the most frequently asked questions around ProgPoW, including design, early review, and a brief overview of an ASIC implementation. Article: The Cost of ASIC Design Highlights on some of the differences between a cryptocurrency-ASIC designer, and a GPU-ASIC designer; how yields works; why low voltage doesn\u2019t work for ProgPoW ASICs; and clarifies why floating-point math is not used in ProgPoW. Article: A Comprehensive ProgPoW Benchmark Benchmarking results from an enthusiast miner, including: results with and without VBIOS modifications; a power consumption and hashrate comparison between Ethash and ProgPoW; a power consumption and hashrate comparison between 0.9.2 and 0.9.3. Article: The Miners Benchmark ProgPoW Comprehensive testing of ProgPoW, version 0.9.2, for both AMD and NVIDIA. Article: AMD isn\u2019t as simple as ABC Addresses a variance between different block heights on both ProgPoW and Ethash, along with  appropriate benchmarking criteria for ProgPoW. ",

This is a great example how the Dev team was swindled by the Johnny come lately \u201ccommunity\u201d that in the end was only here for one thing\u2026to make money. They could care less about Ethereum or the Developers, and as shown in the call, GPU miners. In the end they will walk away if there is no money to be made  This pales in contrast to all the GPU miners who have stayed with Ethereum PATIENTLY waiting two years for the developers to find the time to include an Ethash change that would remove ASICs from the network. Even at 40% ASICs we are still here! I say we invite the supposed DeFi community back on the next Dev call and see if any of them show up. My guess is they are counting what little money they have left to move on to their next venture. Don\u2019t be fooled Developers, DeFi is not a community, they are rich greedy bastards that only care about themselves and were using Ethereum to enrich themselves. The GPU mining community has and always will care about the future of Ethereum. We will be here to help GLADLY usher in Eth2.0 and the birth of POS. ",

Not only are these guys willing to scumbag the entire coin for short term gains - the best part is they will never even make money with their ASIC. They act like Linzhi is a charity. Why on earth would Linzhi sell the ASICs if they can make more just mining on them? Linzhi will sell the ASIC once its no longer profitable because they have the new version. It\u2019s a ponzi scheme, just like all of the other ASIC manufacturers Can\u2019t wait for Ethereum to die out and a real coin with ASIC resistance to come up - I hear there are a few already gaining traction ",
