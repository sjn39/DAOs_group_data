My limited understanding of the current CL chain is that there have been very little to no transactions since Genesis. If possible my proposal is to prune the last 1.5 years from the beacon chain to reduce the size of the db. Not sure if this is even possible or if this is something that the CL clients can do later post merge. ",

The post explains the author's understanding of the current consensus layer chain and asks if this proposal is possible or if it is something that the CL clients can do later post-merge. A third party gives constructive criticism by questioning the feasibility of the proposal and suggests that the author should consider the potential impact on the security of the network.",
