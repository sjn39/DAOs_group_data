Even though she quoted a few extreme/trollish statements, overall @rachel-rose does a decent job covering the many facets of this issue, and helpfully integrates comments made in this forum, in social media, in GitHub, and in deliberations at the 2018 Council of Berlin.  \u201cI think that people feel unstuck in the sense of, \u2018Hey, EIP 867 needs to get turned into an actual process.\u2019\u201d  I\u2019m also really glad the article emphasized another key statement made by @boris on Saturday at the Council of Berlin:  \u201cThere is no finality in the room here,\u201d Boris Mann, co-organizer of the event, reminded everyone. \u201cWe know that humans meeting face-to-face is a good way to get a job done, but finality in any decisions will be made in a much more open and accessible forum than this discussion.\u201d  But unfortunately the extreme aspect came early-on in the article, perhaps dissuading many readers from reading on:  \u201cEthereum is completely centralized.\u201d  It seems that the loudest and most quotable voices too often get included in articles. Could the spirit of this be conveyed without encouraging flat-earth views? Still, we remember that concerns about opaque governance processes are real, and should be thoughtfully addressed. This is part of why we are organizing the Magicians and its Circles! ",

The problem arises once EIPs have been approved and core developers have agree to implement some change. Miners and non-technical community members (or technical ones who are not directly involved with core dev activities) have absolutely no say in what is done before or after EIPs are accepted.  By definition, they are not participants in what happens pre-approval, and once core devs have decided to implement some change there is essentially no viable recourse for these parties. It may be by design that non-technical people are not participating in the EIP process.  That would be a mess and bog down the whole thing. It may also be by design that miners don\u2019t really have any say in things if they plan on taking the most financially viable options. I don\u2019t personally have any issues with the level of centralization, but the way it is handled is extremely opaque and makes it trivial to speculate about all kinds of things.  There is both history and current actions that are troubling, and very little has ever been done to prove that the suspicion is unwarranted. ",

This is the opposite for Ethereum that takes an opt-out approach, and since the vast majority will simply follow what they think the rest of the majority will do (adopt the change), they also adopt it because it\u2019s financially safe. I will also suggest that most miners are participating in pools and/or do not actually know or care about the changes to the protocol.  They only care that it is profitable to mine.  Just how much of the network is like this is impossible to know, but I would say it\u2019s the majority. ",

There are many who have opinions but who are not equipped or interested in being equipped to \u201cget involved\u201d in a meaningful way.  This is why I think the level of centeralization filtering is both by design and beneficial.  It would be more beneficial to make what code/core devs do more transparent so that these individuals (who are economic participants) are not perpetuating some sort of controversy that doesn\u2019t need to exist.  What came out is that everyone is fairly comfortable with technical feedback process.  From within the EthMagicians circle, I assume.  I know that the reddit community has many people who are far from comfortable with things.  Even then, users can run whatever client they feel like.  This is the statement I have the biggest problem with. It\u2019s patently false.  Miners cannot support whatever fork they want if they are acting as rational economically driven entities. They can only support what is financially viable, and what is financially viable is only what core devs decide to implement. This is somewhat concerning on its own because it leaves out those who are not involved in development, but I personally have no problem with that.  I have a problem with people who represent Ethereum claiming that this is not the case though, and the real problem is that \u201cwhat core devs decide to implement\u201d is not a transparent process and is far too easy to speculate about. I find this to be self evident by the fact that I\u2019m here discussing it in a thread about a CoinDesk article also talking about it.  The root of the problem seems to be ignorance, not shady practices (although many who would support my position so far would not agree with this point).  I don\u2019t think you can educate those who wish to remain ignorant, so I think the far simpler solution and one that is most honest is to be clear that Ethereum governance and development is not something everybody can participate in.  It is reserved for those who have high ability, time, money, and desire. ",

There is a certain social weight of individuals that can be outsized, and this has to be acknowledged. They may not represent Ethereum in any structural sense, but their communications do create and reinforce power structures IMO. The weight of their voices is often deserved, as their contributions and expertise are immense. They may also understand or implicitly represent certain important stakeholder concerns. However, some of the social weight has been packed on by the media attention or likes on Twitter, etc. In other cases, it is packed on by having a record in other areas, but perhaps not the area in question. This can lead to distortion in the decision-making because of a possible inaccurate assumption of domain competence. By understanding these power structures and potential distortions, we can create decision-making mechanisms which mitigate the social problems and enable the best decisions possible. Avoiding biases in decision-making is partly why we have defined certain principles for the Fellowship, among them:  open process, all are invited to participate, all notes are public representing yourself in decisions, and not your stakeholder group (that can be done in the rings or other emerging stakeholder groups) technically competent input  ",

From my understanding, the primary point of centralization lies within the current EIP process - something I am under the impression is being actively worked on. I would like to see the EIP process be purely technical, and a separate fully transparent process for deciding which EIPs are going to be supported by core devs.  The latter can happen before the former, meaning EIPs can be rejected by core devs before being fully fleshed out in every technical detail - to avoid worthless work. When I say \u201cfully transparent\u201d, I do not mean \u201canybody can write in, just like the FCC comments\u201d. I mean I would like to see core devs who head important and contentious issue provide a full-disclosure about their bias, motives, etc.  This would go a long way in dispelling a lot of the unknown and speculation about bad actors and whatnot.  Video format would be ideal for this IMO, just because the demographic who benefit most from understanding what the changes are and why the are being supported are not those who are already reading about them on Github/here. I really believe it\u2019s a PR issue, not that core devs are full of bad actors and intentionally doing suspicious things.  There is a centralization concern, but it\u2019s a necessary and beneficial level of centralization for Ethereum, just not transparent enough to quell what seems to be an increasing level of suspicion and (probably) intentional/organized misinformation campaigns.

Broadly speaking, I have seen this coming for a couple of years as interest has gone exponential. The average business person buying crypto on an exchange has no idea about the collaborative process by which open source gets built. Never mind the extra layer of running an open source blockchain network. I am brand new to being this involved in the Ethereum community \u2013 basically you can see me writing up some notes and suggests at the end of May, and then I volunteered to organize the Berlin event \u2013 which was the second ever, and really the first of its kind. Now we have Magicians, Rings, and Scrolls and will be more organized. But, I do have a 15 year history in open source, so this all seems very normal. The community is storming / forming / norming around base processes. What is harder, is there is no central authority to appeal to. I even found that Ethereum projects (that are dapps or otherwise not building node client software) that I reached out to had in many cases not being focused on how to move the core code along. The ERC standard setting (as opposed to EIPs on core protocol) are a vast space where dapps can collaborate. But we have to get those projects to have people within their organization that spend time keeping up, that are welcomed in, and that work together on useful standards. And of course, because a lot of us deeply care about the principles of decentralization, standing up and shouting about \u201cthis is the way it works and I\u2019m in charge\u201d would directly go against that. So we hope people will collaborate around best practices \u2013 because ideally no one can force anything. The larger community are going to have to decide to either get involved directly (which, yes, has a certain time commitment!) or to find voices / people / sources they \u201ctrust\u201d. This has always been the case for open source. I appreciate the effort you have made in the discussion here. I think we ended up in violent agreement  This got long again, and it is late! Cheers! ",

It\u2019s far too easy to assume that there are financial, power, and other ulterior motives behind the actions of core devs and the EIP process. This is not to say that there are any that pose significant threat, but nothing is being done to prevent this speculation.  In fact, the direct opposite is being done.   I have to say, I take mild exception to this. A number of us, including @souptacular and @Arachnid have been responding to outrageous claims of centralization stemming from a lack of understanding, and generally lack of caring to understand, of the EIP and Core Dev process (a loosely coordinated process at that). We\u2019ve each been met with ridicule and contempt. As if what we have said is indicative of some secret agenda or secret contingency. It\u2019s quite frustrating to be honest. There is not much we can do beyond attempting to educate on the process while the FEM and friends try to work on process improvement initiatives (not resolutions or decisions on proposals!). EIP-999 and EIP-867 have been tremendous learning experiences and have given the FEM a lot of insight into where the bottlenecks and challenges are in the process, and they\u2019re (I say they because until I get to go to a meetup in person and contribute more regularly I\u2019m just a Magi-apprentice) working hard to improve an exceptionally hard process.

From the perspective of those who are not closely involved with the FEM or core devs, lack of signalling/governance tools that represent miners and coin holders looks a whole lot like they have zero say in what goes on. I\u2019ve heard many arguments about how miners mean absolutely nothing and are just pawns of the market, and also the complete opposite about how miners are truly the only true decentralized party who can pick and choose what happens - all from within FEM/dev spaces.  Not even knowing the value of these parties contributes to the idea that they really don\u2019t matter very much. These issues are being worked on, and hopefully when they are ready it will solve a lot of these problems.  However, I\u2019m not really convinced that these tools solve the problem with the great divide between what is actually going on with core devs and what the community perceives is going on (or is able to create false narratives about). A pretty relevant example of this would be this whole EIP-999 thing.  What is with the flip-flop that happened? The Reddit/Twitter communities are left only to speculate - which creates a very profitable opportunity for \u201cnews\u201d sites to exploit, furthering the misinformation. This is the kind of social activity that makes people extremely skeptical of any notion of centralization, and \u201ccentralization\u201d to many people == \u201cI don\u2019t personally have a way to impact things\u201d. Eventually, you end up having developer consensus to do something, but the entire community is up in arms over it because they weren\u2019t personally consulted and given tools to provide feedback.  I\u2019m much more concerned with how this turns the community toxic and hostile than I am with any real bad-actor collusion or other conspiracy theory. Hopefully I\u2019ve been able to expressed my concerns clearly at this point, in that \u201ccentralization\u201d from the perspective of the Reddit/Twitter community is very different from the dev community - and I think it has its merits and a basis in the reality of what governance looks like right now.  Signalling tools will hopefully close this gap and represent a gamut of \u201cusers\u201d, whether it\u2019s miners, investors, traders, DApp users, developers, or just those interested in Ethereum and have no other involvement or holdings.

                    "content": "Looking through this (finally), I think @AtLeastSignificant is pointing to two issues that may indicate centralization in Ethereum\u2019s governance:   Whether Ethereum\u2019s client-defaults give Core Devs a special standing in the community. The difference between Eth and Btc is that eth clients have a default upgrade settings on Core approval, whereas a Btc upgrade must be manually executed in all cases. By having the default as eth has it allows for more agility in issues where communication/propagation among pools or miners may frustrate a decision (the DAO rescue is an example), but also captures apathetic voters as practically controlled by Core Devs (and therefore more centralized). Note, I understand miners can override a default if they want to, but I\u2019m of the impression skeptics believe that any time they lose a vote it\u2019s because of the default and not necessarily because of the will of the community/consensus. Personally, I believe a hard-coded default has always been known/transparent and therefore is intertwined in Ethereum\u2019s social contract definition of consensus/immutability, but it seems some have overlooked this. Perhaps this factor should be better emphasized (note, this is also why I\u2019m opposed to having lower on-chain implementation requirements for Core Dev EIPs than others and those sorts of proposals, since it imbues special status to the Core Dev layer of governance that is less available to any other entity).   If the default grants Core Devs some special privilege, how difficult is it for a non-core dev to become a core dev? I don\u2019t think giving Core Devs special privilege is bad from a centralization standpoint if the process of becoming one is transparent. I\u2019ve been involved with Ethereum for three years and I still don\u2019t understand exactly what it takes other than \u201cthe other core devs just kind of know.\u201d @gcolvin also indicated he\u2019s as mystified by the requirements and he is a Core Dev. If there is a document outlining the process is available, maybe broadcasting/educating about that would help. If there isn\u2019t such a document, then maybe it should be created.   Ultimately, this is more about appearance than governance functionality (so far) and to me 999 emphasized that the system actually works as designed. I don\u2019t get the feeling mainstreet thinks Ethereum is substantially centralized (the SEC recently said exactly this), but we\u2019re really discussing shields against maligned trolls changing that perception (possibly with amplification of influential news outlets) or perhaps having certain useful potential contributors turned off from doing so do to misunderstanding (I can think of at least two former contributors and now anti-Eth voices that I think this describes). So this might not even be worth considering. but if we (the community) thinks it\u2019s worth considering, I think those are the two discussion points where centralization might be seen. @AtLeastSignificant please correct me if I\u2019m putting words in your mouth.

                    "content": "@Jason_C I can agree with most of this, but I think there are some nuances -  skeptics believe that any time they lose a vote it\u2019s because of the default and not necessarily because of the will of the community/consensus  It\u2019s really hard to determine what % of votes are due to default values from people just updating their clients vs. updating an coinsciously choosing to leave the defaults.  This was a design choice, meaning somebody somewhere decided that apathetic voters should be counted in one direction rather than the other. That in itself is a massive governance/signalling goof that should be fixed immediately.  IMO, there should be 4 options on a binary vote (yes, no, abstain, no vote).  \u201cAbstain\u201d is the same as \u201cno vote\u201d, but serves to provide insight into total conscious voter participation. From everything I\u2019ve seen and read about, there has never been a vote that represented any majority participation from any demographic (coin holders, miners, etc.) that did not involved default values of some kind.  captures apathetic voters as practically controlled by Core Devs   how difficult is it for a non-core dev to become a core dev?  This is getting at a good point, but also misses the primary issue - you shouldn\u2019t need to be a dev/core dev to have a say in governance decisions.  If the only real way to have a say is to run a node that goes against core devs, then we have already become a centralized blockchain with a power monopoly in the hands of a borderline secret society.  Since running a node that doesn\u2019t support devs is a hopeless and financially wasteful endeavor, the only option left is to try to influence things at the core dev level and in the EIP process. We keep seeing more and more proof that community opinion on matters does not belong/influence anything in these arenas.  If you don\u2019t fix signalling/miner voting and default client value problems, I don\u2019t think we will ever have a real governance process that represents anything other than core devs. Full stop. All the attempts to put checks on core devs and \u201cfight them\u201d on their own turf is inherently pointless since they can censor and change the rules at any point.  It also has no actual enforceable power in terms of what happens to the clients and protocol. This problem becomes even worse when you consider what you\u2019ve brought up about becoming a core dev, because this seems to prevent even those who should undeniably have a say in governance issues from having one, but I still don\u2019t think this should be a technocracy. This will mean choosing what to do with apathetic voters (since I imagine they will be the majority on all matters).  Apathy could be a signal that things as-they-are are good and shouldn\u2019t be changed.  However, I think this is counter to what I believe Ethereum is.  Apathy can also be a signal that people are happy entrusting the core devs with things, which has been the case so far for Ethereum.  With this perspective, I personally think apathetic voters should simply not count at all, and decisions should be made with yes/no/abstain votes (in addition to other signals that represent non-miners). All the attempts to put checks on core devs and \u201cfight them\u201d on their own turf is inherently pointless since they can censor and change the rules at any point.  It also has no actual enforceable power in terms of what happens to the clients and protocol.  Hopefully I\u2019ve addressed why miners really don\u2019t have any say in governance decisions unless they are willing to lose money - the opposite of what a miner wants to do by definition. The other argument I see is that the \u201cmarket\u201d will decide viability of the blockchain.  To this I say: \u2022 The market can\u2019t support or validate what does not exist \u2022 The market does not represent what is good, rational, or popular - only what can be used to make a profit. Do you really want the next Ethereum fork to come about from the same decision makers that sustained Bitconnect? Do you really want money to determine what happens to the blockchain ecosystem at all?
