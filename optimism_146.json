DeFi Committee A Project description: Abracadabra is one of the leading decentralized lending platforms in DeFi. We provide loans in our collateral-backed stablecoin, Magic Internet Money (MIM), against a wide variety of collateral (e.g., LP tokens, ERC-20 tokens, Yearn vault tokens, etc.) to unlock maximum capital efficiency. We can help Optimism kickstart an active and robust DeFi ecosystem by introducing MIM to the chain and providing our battle-tested lending services. Project links:  Website: https://abracadabra.money/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell (123K Followers) Discord: Abracadabra money (3K+ DAU)  Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: Popsicle Finance Relevant usage metrics:  $400M TVL 10K+ outstanding CDP positions $210M of circulating $MIM, our decentralized stablecoin One of the highest yielding pools on Curve ($170M TVL) @ boosted yield of 10.5% Analytics page   Screen Shot 2022-09-06 at 10.05.45 AM794\u00d798 5.34 KB  Competitors, peers, or similar projects: We are the leading lending protocol for DeFi strategies and have been the inspiration for several protocols. Some projects that are similar to us:  Vesta Finance (https://vestafinance.xyz/) Yeti Finance (https://yetifinance.co/) MAI Finance (https://www.mai.finance/)  Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes. Much of our Solidity code has already been audited, open sourced, and battle-tested. Code base can be found here: Abracadabra \u00b7 GitHub Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: We\u2019re already deployed the requisite contracts on Optimism. We have created 2 cauldrons so far. Now, we\u2019re focused on seeding initial liquidity for $MIM\u2026 Velodrome OP/USDC Cauldron: 0x68f498C230015254AFF0E1EB6F85Da558dFf2362 Stargate USDC Cauldron: 0x0981a77C825CBF9fced939e05f12387Ef1955b90 $MIM: 0xb153fb3d196a8eb25522705560ac152eeec57901 $SPELL: 0xE3AB61371ECc88534C522922a026f2296116C109 Velodrome pool:  Currently bribing 5M $SPELL per week 6th largest pool on Velodrome with $4.7M TVL (at 9.65% APY)   Screen Shot 2022-10-19 at 11.55.22 AM959\u00d760 16 KB  Ecosystem Value Proposition: We can help Optimism kickstart an active and robust DeFi ecosystem by introducing $MIM to the chain and providing our battle-tested lending services to grow overall TVL. Given that we already have tremendous traction on other EVM chains, we think we\u2019ll have an outsized impact in bringing users to Optimism. For many of our followers / existing use base, this will be the first time they have interacted with Optimism. We can also help increase capital efficiency for various protocols (and for Optimism itself) by letting folks borrow against their LP tokens. We have already launched an OP/USDC LP cauldron, which means that LPers will not only be able to boost the liquidity of the OP token, but also mint stablecoins against their positions instead of selling / unstaking. This will ultimately create more long-term holders of OP and long-term providers of liquidity. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. Number of OP tokens requested: 800K $OP ($560K) We are basing this number on the following previous successful asks from other DeFi protocols incentivizing activity on their platforms (e.g., borrowing / lending / liquidity).   QiDao received 750K OP on $50M TVL (across all chains)  Tarot received 540K OP on $17M TVL (across all chains)  Yearn received 1,000K OP on $500M TVL (across all chains)  Abracadabra asking 800K OP on $400M TVL (across all chains)  Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No. How much will your project match in co-incentives?: We are currently matching the grant 102%.  We are prepared to deploy up to 12M (~$11K) $SPELL tokens to hit our stated goal of 15% APY. Over the course of a year, this will equate to $570K+ of SPELL incentives (vs. the $560K of $OP grant). We have been conducting liquidity / bribe tests on Velodrome. With just 5M $SPELL bribes per week, we have $4.5M+ TVL are the 6th largest pool.  As we ramp up to 12M $SPELL per week, we should expect the TVL to increase to ~$12M. If we add $OP incentives on top of that, we should expect to hit $18-$20M of TVL. This will allow us to support 1-2 medium sized cauldrons, or, alternatively, 5-10 small sized cauldrons (which, frankly may be more appropriate given current TVL and access to DeFi protocols). As mentioned earlier, we have a long-term outlook and after $OP rewards run out, we will continue funding incentives from our treasury. We currently have 2+ years worth of incentives allocated for liquidity emissions. Proposal for token distribution: Liquidity Mining (50% of grant): 50% of the $OP tokens will go towards liquidity mining (which acts as our major form of marketing). While these are being deployed via liquidity incentives. Liquidity sits at the heart of our leverage protocol and without it, we will be unable to operate on a new chain. Development (40% of grant): 40% of the $OP tokens will be allocated to developing our NFT borrowing platform called Potion. We are excited about introducing NFT lending to Optimism and think this could be a breakthrough development for protocols / users that possess Velodrome veNFTs. Community Participation (10% of grant): 10% of the $OP tokens will be allocated to encouraging members of the Abracadabra community to identify and work with protocols to develop new strategies and cauldrons. We want to use this portion of the grant to encourage and fuel the process of decentralization. ",

We think the liquidity won\u2019t be there without the right incentives, but I think it\u2019s worth investing time now so we can hit the ground running if/when this proposal passes (plus it shows the community we\u2019re serious). I\u2019m going to take a second pass at perhaps putting a cap on the OP token distribution, so we can stretch out time. I don\u2019t necessarily believe we should stretch it to 12 months (especially if APY is too low), but I agree that we shouldn\u2019t exhaust rewards in 1 month either. ",

Post our discussion with the Velo team, we\u2019re adding some details related to the LP depth models you\u2019ve helped us with (see below). UPDATE (8/19/2022) We just got out of a productive meeting with the Velodrome team who graciously helped us model out liquidity depth and APY of a pool given the above incentives\u2026 Update posted below (and edited original post to reflect). Let\u2019s conservatively assume we\u2019ll have ~$10K in weekly bribes (between $OP and $SPELL), we will receive a ~50% bonus APY. This means that we would see a $15K weekly bribe amount. Over 52 weeks, that\u2019s roughly $780K in rewards. If we target a 15% APY, we would expect $5.2M of liquidity depth. On top of this, however, the Velodrome team has suggested that there is currently a multiplier effect of roughly 3-4x on emission bribes. So we could actually be looking at a figure in the range of $15-20M. Separately, we have been working on some magic partnerships\u2026 We\u2019ve got some tricks up our sleeves that could help us boost APYs and liquidity even further (still in the works, so stay tuned). We think a 15% APY with a $15-20M TVL stable pool seems very feasible. ",

Curve and Abra have a deeply intertwined history working together, and especially now that Abra has voted to lock CRV and vote in Curve governance, it would be in your interest to work with Curve on Optimism. No disrespect to other DEX\u2019s, which you should certainly experiment with, but Curve has an established history and proven itself to be a sustainable and secure platform. The prudent strategy is to allocate according to risk, which should consider longevity, team, and brand. I suggest Abra propose a Curve gauge on Optimism and make use of its locked CRV to help direct liquidity toward your own pool. Hopefully the above proposal passes, which means the gauged MIM pool will receive additional OP incentives. I found this lukewarm take on working with Curve disappointing, because of our history as partners, and especially since Abra is the one that stands to benefit the most. But I understand the post was written a month ago and things change fast. Now you are aware Curve is expanding on Optimism and we want to continue the relationship with Abra that we have had so far on mainnet. ",

We have been in discussions with some liquidity / voting protocols (think Tokemak / Convex styled protocols) that might help us increase liquidity mining rewards. That said, none of these have been finalized and they will require further investment on our side, so we need to be thoughtful about how much liquidity we need and when. Future vaults will come but will depend on 1) Yields and 2) Depth of our liquidity. With enough liquidity, we should be able to launch 3-5 high-yielding (non-stable) vaults in the next quarter on Optimism. I can\u2019t give too many details about the new $MIM token just yet, but it\u2019s a native representation of $MIM and will allow us to bridge and repay from other chains in a single transaction. We think this upgrade also allows us to reduce some of the vulnerabilities related to bridged $MIM. In the final comment, I realized I had a typo\u2026 It should read \u201cI also agree that we should not exhaust rewards in one month either.\u201d If you want rough guidelines on how we\u2019ll distribute rewards across 12 months, the easiest would be to just take 1/12th of the tokens and allocate it for monthly rewards. In reality, what we\u2019ll do is a monthly adjustment based on depth of liquidity + current APY on the pools. We still think targeting a 15% APY is roughly correct and so between $SPELL + $OP, that\u2019s the APY that we will optimize around. If the APY is higher than expected, we\u2019ll reduce $OP/$SPELL distribution. If the APY is lower than expected, we\u2019ll increase the $OP/$SPELL distribution. Hope this helps! ",

Great question! There\u2019s a direct relationship between depth of liquidity on a DEX and the amount of APY that is paid out on a pool. This relationship is generally dictated by the market and so it\u2019s not something we\u2019ll ever have direct control over. Generally speaking, the higher the APY, the higher the liquidity. If we somehow fall short of 15%, then the market will naturally correct itself by removing TVL from the pool. Ultimately, this means that we\u2019ll just end up with less TVL and therefore a smaller number of cauldrons.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  I have noticed that the implementation in Arbitrum happened a little over 1 year ago, and they still maintain only one cauldron (perhaps it is due to lack of alternatives?)   This is a similar question to what @MinimalGravitas is asking re: Arbitrum, so I\u2019ll try to kill two birds with one stone here\u2026 One of the lessons we learned with respect to the Arbitrum expansion was that it\u2019s critical to have a plan for how to grow the liquidity on a chain before we open a bunch of cauldrons. Arbitrum was basically a test for us to see 1) Market appetite for leverage on the chain, and 2) Cost differences across chains. Because we never received a grant, the Arbitrum expansion was entirely funded by our treasury, so we had to be thoughtful about how much liquidity we could afford to bring to Arbitrum (versus expanding to other chains). This is one of the key drivers for why we are applying for this $OP grant this time around. Our Arbitrum MIM-2pool pool currently sits at ~$11M TVL, which means that we can really only support 2-3 small cauldrons and 1-2 medium cauldrons. As the market cooled, we began seeing less appetite for leverage on volatile pairs and more appetite for stablecoin strategies. We made a pivot back in Q2 to focus on stable farming and have reached a point in the contract lifecycle where we feel confident we can roll these strategies out on multiple chains. We will be launching a second small cauldron (for stablecoins) very soon on Arbitrum, so stay tuned for that! ",

We\u2019d like to mention that we also have reservations towards the Abracadabra, Wonderland ecosystems as we see a tendency towards rather reckless growth, non-transparent dealings and appreciation of grey area projects & personalities - but we hope to change our opinion and see your positive impact on Op. Why share this? Value-aligned teams, long-term-aligned projects are essential for Optimism! You mention tremendous traction on other EVM chains & outsized impact in bringing users to Optimism. TVL has decreased significantly due to a variety of issues (Sifu, intransparent liquidations/frontrunning, loss of confidence, macro, Terra & resulting losses\u2026) and esp been short-lived on chains other than Eth. We\u2019d like to first & foremost understand the reasoning & your long-term plans for  building on Optimism sustaining liquidity on Optimism (15% APY to sustain liquidity, incentives dry up, TVL goes away?) moving existing users and liquidity from other chains to Optimism (any plans outside LM?)   image757\u00d7473 32.5 KB  Some insight into \u201cmagic partnerships\u201d and \u201ctricks\u201d might help us understand as well      0xEdwardo:  Separately, we have been working on some magic partnerships\u2026 We\u2019ve got some tricks up our sleeves that could help us boost APYs and liquidity even further (still in the works, so stay tuned). We think a 15% APY with a $15M TVL stable pool seems very feasible.   Re: Value-add, Proposal Ask, Distribution, Co-incentives  MIM has been relatively stable and so far proven to withstand some turbulances without centralized USD backing The value-add to Optimism will mainly be defined by the liquidity & users you move to the ecosystem. (We don\u2019t see much added value for other projects & borrowers/stable users on Op) The Ask is on the high-end but okayish for a project like Abracadabra. The mentioned co-incentives are pretty solid (See Question below)  You mention 7.5M Spell ($10K) in co-incentives a week (-> $520K total). At current Spell price (0.001$) this is $7.5K (-> $390K total). Would you be up to do $10K USD in weekly co-incentives? ",

                    "content": "Thanks for keeping an open mind, @ScaleWeb3. Happy to address some of the concerns you\u2019ve mentioned: Your concerns Sifu - I believe you are confusing Wonderland for Abracadabra. Sifu has never played a role in the Abracadabra product. Wonderland is run as a completely separate protocol and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially fair or relevant to link Wonderland events to what we\u2019re trying to do at Abracadabra. Transparency around liquidations - All liquidations happen on chain just like every other DeFi protocol. Not clear what you mean about lack of transparency, but even if we wanted to hide something, it\u2019s not clear how we could / would. Terra - Like most DeFi protocols / chains, we do our best to serve our loyal users and customers. When we open a new leverage market, Abracadabra ultimately accepts collateral risk. In the case of Anchor, we had enormous market demand and we were simply doing our best to meet it. There was $16B worth of deposits at the time and we believed that the protocol was relatively stable (as did many major players, including Celsius, 3AC, Jump, etc.). Despite having a very large cauldron, because we had designed the cauldron with the right liquidation parameters, we managed to escape with only ~$11M of bad debt (impressive given we peaked at ~$800M of TVL at one point). We have since been more thoughtful about having a set of risk parameters that we use to control size of cauldrons, so we hope to avoid similar situations in the future. Like most of DeFi, we don\u2019t have all the answers\u2026 We\u2019re just trying to figure it out together. Short-lived on other chains - Our leverage markets are driven entirely by user appetite. DeFi TVLs have shrunk across the board and yields have come down, so it\u2019s only natural that users are not taking risk-on leverage. Long-term plans We are fundamentally a multi-chain protocol, so any innovation that we pursue for EVM-chains will also be deployed on Optimism. As mentioned above, we\u2019re committed to providing leverage wherever users demand it, and so we\u2019re hoping that Optimism will end up being a great place to launch more cauldrons! This is, of course, subject to many other factors (e.g., depth of liquidity, etc.) and so we\u2019d like to use this Optimism grant to derisk some of those factors. Sustainable liquidity boils down to our protocol being profitable so that we can continue offering bribes that are competitive with the market. There are a number of ways we can do that, including but not limited to 1) Increasing the fees we collect, 2) Protocol-owned veTokens, 3) Protocol-owned farming. Most DeFi protocols have not figured out the sustainability piece yet, so I think our current state is fairly reasonable. As for migration of liquidity and users from other chains, it really just depends on demand and bribes. We are expecting demand to go up as more innovative DeFi protocols are built and Optimism users begin searching for leverage. Bribes will come in the form of OP and SPELL incentives\u2026 We\u2019re very sure this will work as it has worked on other chains previously. Partnerships We have been in discussions with some liquidity / voting protocols (think Tokemak / Convex styled protocols) that might help us increase liquidity mining rewards. That said, none of these have been finalized and they will require further investment on our side, so we need to be thoughtful about how much liquidity we need and when. Value-add, Proposal Ask, Distribution, Co-incentives     ScaleWeb3:  The value-add to Optimism will mainly be defined by the liquidity & users you move to the ecosystem. (We don\u2019t see much added value for other projects & borrowers/stable users on Op)   When we offer leverage, we do it because of user demand, so it should be useful for OP users that are looking to participate in DeFi. I would also argue that leverage is extremely useful for other projects as it increases depth of liquidity. As an example, we have managed to bring Stargate more than $30M of liquidity on Ethereum.     ScaleWeb3:  You mention 7.5M Spell ($10K) in co-incentives a week (-> $520K total). At current Spell price (0.001$) this is $7.5K (-> $390K total). Would you be up to do $10K USD in weekly co-incentives?   Volatility is well-known phenomenon within our sector, so we would happily revisit the co-incentives closer to an agreement to reflect adequate compensation from both sides. ",

Not sure if you know me, my name is Romy and I have been involved in Abra since the beginning through community management, QA and BD. First of all, I really don\u2019t see why Wonderland matters in this discussion about bringing the Abracadabra products onto Optimism. Wonderland has not been involved in Abra in any way, other than the fact that we offered leverage on their token in the same way as we do for many other protocols. The fact that one of our founders also worked on a controversial project should not be the primary decision criteria for judging our protocol. And more importantly, this does not affect the positive effect that having MIM and our leverage engine on Optimism could bring to the community. Even if that mattered, the Abracadabra team is composed of many individuals that have been working non stop to improve the DeFi ecosystem. As a proof of that, you can see the amazing relationships we have with bluechips protocols such as Curve, Yearn and Sushiswap. In addition, we have been also closely working with a pillar of defi on Optimism such as Velodrome. Judging our product, and what we do, just because of past actions that were not even related to us seems unfair. If you have concerns or feedbacks on what we do, we are more than happy to address them, but if you are judging us for the characteristics of another product with a different business model and a different team, this is simply wrong and offensive to all the people that work everyday to have MIM on the edge of DeFi innovation. Lastly, I agree with you that in the video you linked Dani made a bad joke, but once again it is completely not related to Abracadabra. If you wanna discuss more you can easily come on our Discord and speak with me directly, either in General or DMs, I will be more than happy to explain you everything you need. ",

I\u2019ve seen projects like SushiSwap be rugged by people like Chefnomi and later (when the bad name goes away) the community builds something great behind it. If this is the case then you only need to confirm Daniele Sestagalli is not part of the project anymore. ",

As for the grant being used for \u201cexit liquidity for those rugged by SPELL\u201d, it is purely and simply not true.

To reply to your question: yes, dani is still involved in Abracadabra, even though he is no longer involved in Wonderland. You can check his resignation here. In addition, I would like to point out that Dani took a period of reflection after what happened with Sifugate, and the rest of Abracadabra team, like me, 0xEdwardo, Merlin and Wicked have stepped up and now handle most of the day to day operations. We have never been involved with Wonderland in any way. I very much doubt that the philosophy with which Abra operates is misaligned with the vision you have for Optimism. Furthermore, it is important to note that Abracadabra is a DAO and any major decisions are taken by SPELL holders. The team mostly executes them. To reply to your second question, behind Abracadabra there is a team of individuals who have the best interest of DeFi at heart. Actions speak louder than words and I hope that the actions that we have taken in the past months and going forward will prove this to you. ",

Value-Add Abra allows users to mint their collateral-backed stablecoin, MIM, which can be used to swap any other traditional stablecoin. Abra is not fully deployed on Optimism yet but their TVL on mainnet is large - despite trending down since the bear market started & demand for leverage went down. Traction During the bull market, Abra had several Billion USD in TVL across chains. Today, Abracadabra is a multi-chain DeFi platform available on 4 chains with maximum liquidity on the settlement layer Ethereum. TVL as per:-  Defillama :- 377M Their centralized powerBI dashboard: - 425M In Proposal: - 450M+ Average loan side is approx. $20K and total open loans are 10.5K (as per their BI Dashboard)  Amount 800K $OP - amount on the high-end but reasonable for a large stablecoin project. Strong focus on liquidity mining might not be long-lasting. OP Distribution 640K Op for Liquidity mining and 160K Op will be used for delegation. Their goal is distribute $10K weekly bribe distributed between $OP and $Spell Co-incentives 7.5M $Spell (approx 7.5K) /week Alignment Abra\u2019s TVL on chains outside Ethereum was short-lived and seems to have very little traction now. Abracadabra is not yet fully deployed on Optimism and we are not 100% confident in the team\u2019s long-term alignment with Optimism. Recommendation NO We would like to see Abra fully deployed on Optimism. Once its deployed and they have some user traction, we recommend Abra to submit their proposal again. Preferably, we\u2019d also like to see more sticky incentives and not a pure focus on liquidity mining. Our committee expects grant recipients to use grant funding for specific actions to spur growth on Optimism. Our committee does not believe that grant recipients should use $OP received for governance. Optimism governance is open, transparent and community oriented, anyone can participate and have their voice heard by simply being an active part of the collective. If voting power is needed, we encourage to seek other available options such as market buying $OP or asking community to delegate their tokens. Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread. ",

We\u2019ll be working with them to devise a more interesting slate of asks that could bring new types of activity to Optimism. We invite some other delegates to weigh in on specific things they might like to see as well, given Abracadabra\u2019s particular features. Things we\u2019re envisioning are encouraging minting against novel forms of collateral, more uses for OP, and partnerships with some OP-native protocols. One note: we\u2019ve worked with Abracadabra\u2019s team, and they are thoughtful, forward-thinking people. It\u2019s been a shame to read some superficial assessments of their team, and we\u2019re hopeful that as they spend more time delivering on big plans on Optimism, people will come to appreciate what they add to the community.

                    "content": "Thanks everyone for providing feedback in Cycle #7! We\u2019re processing through it now and will make the following changes for Cycle #8:   It seems controversial to use any part of the $OP grant for participating in the ecosystem. As such, we will modify the proposal and use 100% of it towards building / participation incentives.   It seems that Optimism is no longer encouraging grants to be used solely for liquidity mining incentives. Because funding liquidity is vital to the success of the rest of our development, we cannot eliminate it entirely. That said, we are happy to fund incentives from our treasury and instead find alternative uses for the $OP grant, including funding development and incentivizing community participation on Optimism. More details will be added to the main proposal.   As stated above, we will increase co-incentives on Optimism to show our commitment to the chain from 7.5M SPELL per week to 10M SPELL per week.   It seems like most folks think the ask of 800K $OP on $400M TVL is too large. We will look into adjusting slightly and will provide more proof points as to why we think we are justified (on a relative basis) for requesting that size.   ",

Second, this self-delegation should be more specific in its reasoning to do this. And last, we and our community don\u2019t forget the events that happened with some founders or teams members of the protocol and friends, this lack of trust is inevitable, so seeing Abracadabra in action on Optimism and getting some traction can give a different perspective on adoption and commitment.
