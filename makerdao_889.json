SG Forge continues to progress on its regulatory and compliance assessment and selection of potential brokers to convert DAI into fiat. This regulatory and compliance assessment and selection remains outstanding. It\u2019s currently the key transaction blocker and dependency. Commercial/Risk/Legal We have made solid progress on two of the three legal agreements to evidence the transaction. All of the legal agreements will be governed by French law. Instruction - The instruction is the instrument under which DIIS Group, as representative for the Maker community, acts under the DAI Loan Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. As a commercial and legal matter, we have aligned with SG-Forge that the instruction be an instrument approved by the Maker token holders and DIIS Group. SG-Forge and its counsel have signed off on this approach. The original draft contemplated an agreement signed by DIIS Group and Maker DAO. The instruction includes a mechanism for DIIS Group to take instructions (as required) from a delegated committee of Maker representatives (the appointment, replacement and authorities of which to be further developed, and proposed in the Risk Assessment). But the intention is for the delegated committee to be an authorized real world communication point for any loan administration related issues and communications. DAI Loan Agreement - The DAI Loan Agreement outlines the key commercial terms of the transaction. The DAI Loan Agreement also includes the collateral ratio threshold, cure periods, and liquidation triggers if the collateral ratio is breached. RWF is working with SG-Forge to align on a valuation metric for the OFH Token by referencing a pool of similar covered bonds. Pledge Agreement - SG-Forge will prepare the pledge agreement after our final alignment on the Instruction and the DAI Loan Agreement. As a legal matter, the incubating LTS core unit spent some time with external counsel (including SG-Forge\u2019s French counsel) to better understand the legal risks and potential mitigants associated with SG-Forge holding the \u201ckeys\u201d to the OFH Tokens. This is a novel issue as the \u201ckeys\u201d give SG-Forge control over the OFH Tokens in the event of a liquidation. The incubating LTS core unit will provide a more detailed write-up of the risks and mitigants in the Risk Assessment (when published). We consider this issue to be resolved with SG-Forge. Collateral Engineering Services CES has continued to work with SG-Forge on the incorporation of the OFH Token into a Maker Vault. CES and SG-Forge have worked collaboratively to evaluate several potential mechanisms to incorporate the OFH Token (which is not ERC-20 compliant) into the Maker Protocol. CES has aligned with SG-Forge to adopt the MIP-21 process for the OFH Token. Growth Growth remains abreast and engaged with SG-Forge and the Maker core units in moving the transaction towards a successful on-boarding. @SylvFromSG-Forge @Growth-Core-Unit @collateral-core-unit @Real-World-Finance @luca_pro ",

We have aligned with SG Forge on an appropriate liquid benchmark covered bond. The incubating LTS and @Eumenes held a call with SG Forge and DIIS Group to align on the frequency of calculating the market value of the benchmark covered bond and the regularity of reporting on the market value. The incubating LTS exchanged drafts of the DAI Loan Agreement, the Instruction Letter, and the Runbook with SG Forge and then held an alignment call with SG Forge\u2019s internal counsel on the agreement drafting. @collateral-core-unit, @Real-World-Finance and the incubating LTS aligned with SG Forge on the Runbook (which basically describes the mechanics of the MIP21 process in an Excel file). SG Forge provided further revised drafts of the DAI Loan Agreement and the Instruction Letter at the end of April. The incubating LTS will be reviewing. SG Forge\u2019s external counsel will prepare the first draft of a standard French pledge agreement now that we are aligned on the key terms of the DAI Loan Agreement and the Instruction Letter. @Eumenes and I have begun to prepare a Risk Assessment.     christiancdpetersen:  SG Forge continues to progress on its regulatory and compliance assessment and selection of potential brokers to convert DAI into fiat.

But with commodity prices going through the roof, I\u2019m surprised that SocGen, ING, and others alike\u2013who have a history of funding commodity trading houses(physical traders)\u2013are not pressing the Gas-Pedal on funding the physical commodity supply-chain with DAI. I have to believe the need is abundant\u2013because of the cost that physical commodities incur, including leveraging, hedging, (taking short positions, incurring margin calls, lack of equity) and the fact that liquidity is running dry. Hopefully this transaction opens up a brand new door of opportunities and possibilities. ",
