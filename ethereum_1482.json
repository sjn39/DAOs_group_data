I didn\u2019t really even consider alternatives, but having followed two Coursera courses, I don\u2019t really see what the value-add is. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are some fringe features that some people derive a lot of value from (quizzes?). I have no experience with Udemy. The advantages of YouTube is putting your course in front of extra eyeballs and making it easy to find, both on YouTube and Google. The auto-captioning is also pretty good. I didn\u2019t make use of it, but the chaptering feature is also pretty nice to help returning students to navigate the video. Something I was missing on YouTube is the ability to add annotations at arbitrary timestamps in the video (this was possible once upon a time, but not anymore). I\u2019m not sure if other platforms allow this. One downside is that Google is a shitty company to rely on, with a history of dropping support for things for no reason (we already mentionned annotations in this post). If you want to preserve the course for the long haul, worth considering (though crypto probably moves too fast anyway). ",
