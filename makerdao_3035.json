With the DAI flashminting Module in preparation, what about we offer a little tool (could be integrated into oasis-borrow) that  flashmints the amount of DAI needed to pay back the debt pays back the debt remove (all or just the needed) collateral to trades it to back to dai (oasis trade, uniswap) repay the flashminted DAI  All in one tx?

It would even help mitigate all the gas fees in situations like Black Thursday where responsible vault owners were trying to keep their loan collateralized but stuck between paying obscene gas for the multitude of transactions (assuming no ability to program the action themselves) or risking liquidation. This would be an awesome tool to have on the Oasis app, and we could even charge a small commission for the service to make up for the development work that would go into creating the function. Plus, it obviously helps people like the OP who (like myself) were caught off guard by the sudden 5x of the dust minimum. Any developers think this is something they could tackle? ",

If we are relying on third parties and promoting them for use within Oasis we are opening ourselves up to another layer of risk. What happens if the flashloan from Aave or DeFi Saver incorrectly preforms an action and opens a vault up for liquidation? Would MKR holders be on the hook because we advertised using these systems? I think if something has an important functionality it\u2019s imperative that it can happen entirely within our own system. ",
