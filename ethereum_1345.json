I would take another approach: I see many projects in ethereum space have good devs but are badly managed and nothing happens. Is it because the classical hierarchy based Project Management doesn\u2019t really work well in ethereum space? Is it because ethereum devs are creative freedom-loving people working distributed over the world and it is not easy to herd the cats? Is it because ICOs promises better money for less job and incentives are not sufficient? I think we should discuss Project Management challenges in Ethereum developer community in the similar way we discuss Governance for whole community. Bad Project Management puts whole ethereum project at risk currently. I would like to discuss the topic at the next FEM \u201cConcil of Berlin\u201d. What about you? ",

Is there any person, feeling responsibility to track the efforts in public? I don\u2019t know any. Possibly some PM work gets done by EF but it is not public. Solution proposal:  A PM should collect meaningful signals (whatever they are) from the project and make it public accessible by project members and by ethereum community. A PM should provide a public overview of most important projects in ethereum space with focus on integration and interoperability. A PM may be anyone. There could be many PMs with different views. It is less about governance, more about transparency and keeping focus. more ideas?  ",

All the successful products and services on the market usually have \u201canonymously\u201d long supply chains - and even if you find some where that is not the case, they span more than a single organisation. In my mind, ethereum or blockchain or p2p or whatever you call that trend that ethereum is part of, it\u2019s all about getting rid of middlemen. In my mind, projects should have customers/clients/users/\u2026 and the project makes it\u2019s own decisions - which ideally means every single developer makes his own decisions and takes care of their/her/his clients/customers/users\u2026 \u2026and if something doesn\u2019t work well, it\u2019s all open source - copy and fork around the problem. I think \u201cproject management\u201d as such should be avoided at all costs and only be a last resort in cases where it\u2019s hard to find an alternative way of doing things. This might mean educating all people with the necessary knowledge and skills around how to organise in such a way - and in cases where this is hard, the copy/fork mechanism can be used to re-structure ",

As I already wrote above, the term \u201cProject/Program Management\u201d has two aspects:   Management: usual authoritative management and governance methods. We don\u2019t like that and we are trying to replace them with better approaches.  Construction: put different ethereum projects together, making it working properly.  AFAIK, the ethereum management philosophy encourages people to find tasks for themselves and suporting them if they make something useful. Therefore, the manager\u2019s role is here to find developers and make their reputation and rewards depending from their work done. It is less management but more social netwoking. Putting different parts in some ethereum project together requires broad integral knowledge of many projects in ethereum space, their features, drawbacks and differences. This is a new job profile in ethereum space. I would call it Ethereum Architect. Ethereum Architect \u2026  knows almost all sub projects in ethereum space (and makes his knowledge public), \u2026 incl. project\u2019s features, performance, interoperability and future development. proposes ethereum based solutions for external customer\u2019s needs (it is his B2B consultant business). creates a EIP\u2019s in particular projects to improve their interoperability and UX, based on his experience in customer\u2019s projects. usually integrates existing parts together instead of creating new ones. represents customer needs in technical ethereum discussions.  Ethereum Architect performs governance by signalling customer needs into ethereum community, project needs to each other, Ethereum Architect is not a core Developer and not necessary focused on developing of some core project. I would propose to create a Ring of Ethereum Architects instead of this \u201cProject Management\u201d  topic. Your thoughts? ",
