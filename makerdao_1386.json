                    "content": " DAIF CU Update - Q2 2022  First of all, even though it did not happen in Q2, we have published our budget for the next year here. Please review and ask any questions you may have for our next year budget. Now for Q2: Getting assets into use for the DAO There have been a number of formal requests from Maker community members to use MakerDAO intangible assets. None of these were contested and they are documented in the Asset Registry which now also is available in Github such that experienced Github users easily can track changes over time. If you are new to this, then it basically works like this: If you have a site/app you want to host on a new subdomain of makerdao.com, e.g. https://kpi.makerdao.com/ then you have to publish an Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management request on the Forum as described in MIP60. Here you can see an example of such a request. If nobody contests the application in a seven day period, you are good to go. The Asset Registry will be updated with you as Content Manager for said asset and TechOps will on behalf of Dai Foundation make the DNS configuration to point the makerdao.com subdomain to the site that you are running. If you want Content Manager access to one of the SoMe accounts owned by Dai Foundation, the process is basically the same - and very soon you will also be able to use the process to request email accounts. You are responsible for the content you produce and you are responsible for for what it takes to produce it - like for example running the website that is published on a subdomain of makerdao.com If you need configuration changes ONCE you have gotten Content Manager access to an asset, then you go to https://change.daifoundation.org/ and issue a request for this change, but remember first time before you can use this you have to go through the MIP60 process. Adding MakerDAO appointed board members Dai Foundation is committed to include two members appointed by MakerDAO on its board.  We did present general requirements to become a board member on the  Spot On: Dai Foundation Core Unit Update on April 13th, 2022 at 15:00 UTC kindly hosted by Retro. This has been followed by a formal Call for interest in becoming a Dai Foundation board member. As part of this outreach, DAI Foundation is having an in-person meeting in Paris during EthCC for interested parties to meet and engage with current members of the Dai Foundation board. However physical presence will not be a prerequisite for any candidate. We thank the Event Core unit for providing us with venue and logistics for this event. Copyright and Software Patents In our last quarterly update we said we would take a stab at facilitating further community dialogue and analysis on the topic of Copyright and Software Patents. This has so far not been achieved. We are looking into ways to get a good analysis of the topic area before kicking off this important discussion. Trademarks As reported in the last status there was a deadline in June 2022 for showing proof of usage of the MAKERCON and STABLECON marks. The Events core unit has been very helpful in establishing this proof. Unfortunately our proof was turned down because it referred to future events. Accepted proof for usage of conference trademarks MUST relate to conferences that already have been held before the deadline. We now have the option to apply for these trademarks again. However, given the current need for financial restraint, and the lack of a clear plan for really bringing these marks to life, we will at this time not put in a new trademark registration application. In the last quarterly update we reported a potential trademark infringement that we were investigating. This is ongoing - we have together with our trademark lawyers researched this extensively and established contact with the company and their legal advisers. We will provide an update when we have a resolution. Scamming sites We have taken down a number of scamming sites, and SoMe accounts (Medium + Twitter) The scammers pointed users to different impersonations of Maker webapps to trick users into sending them funds or disclose their seed phrase. It is tedious and time consuming to get App providers, Hosting providers and Domain registrars to act. We will in the following quarter work with TechOps to make sure we have an action card that collect all knowledge about how to take scamming sites down, to establish clear channels for community members to report scamming sites, and to provide a place with status on reported sites such that user can check whether a certain scamming site already has been reported. We also received a report of an event using the makerdao name in their own context that has nothing to do with MakerDAO. We have reached out and asked them to cease this activity immediately. Conferences As mentioned we will have a meeting during EthCC, and I will be there July 19-21 so please reach out if there is anything that you want to discuss with me in person in Paris. Budget reporting Please see the update here. TL;DR with an unbudgeted expense over the next month we do expect to use all our vested funds. Makerdao Github Update The mandate of Dai Foundation is not to provide software development operational services, but rather to ensure IP ownership. We are therefore preparing to hand over the operational aspects of the Makerdao Github to another party. Part of this preparation is to perform cleanup and classification activities for the current content in the github project.  Read more in Classification and cleanup of the makerdao github - Request for comments Software Copyright An important part of preparing the Makerdao Github is to ensure that software copyright is properly assigned to Dai Foundation and properly documented both in the Makerdao github as well as in other Github organizations used to develop software funded by MakerDAO. To that effect Dai Foundation has deployed an open source Contributor License Agreement Assistant (CLA Assistant) that easily integrates with Github. Once integrated with a repository the assistant ensures as part of the Pull Request that the contributor has accepted this MakerDAO Individual Contributor License Agreement. Further we have published Guidance for MakerDAO software developers on how to assign Copyright with recommendations on how to specify the copyright in the code and in repositories plus description for repository admins of how to integrate the CLA Assistant. Ensuring DAO access to assets funded by the DAO The tools and processes described above aren\u2019t worth much if they aren\u2019t used. It is important to ensure that new assets created and maintained by MakerDAO funding generally become public goods for the DAO. To re-enforce this and to avoid that DAO operations are endangered due to asset rights disappearing when a CU/facilitator is off-boarded, we have drafted a set of questions to ensure that there is focus on avoiding that single operators can control important MakerDAO assets and communication channels. There can be situations where specific parties shall retain ownership of certain assets. This is acknowledged, but in such cases it should be transparent for Maker Governance that this is happening and why. Our goal is therefore to have new core units answer these questions as well as existing core units when they request funding. Dai Foundation Grants Due to the legal basis of a Danish non-profit foundation Dai Foundation is obliged to offer grants. We are working toward being able to make a call for grant applications at our meeting during EthCC this month. That was what I had for now. As always feel free to reach out with questions here or 1-1, we are here to serve the community in the capacity laid and in line with the DAI Foundation Purpose. All the best Your DAIF CU Facilitator ",
