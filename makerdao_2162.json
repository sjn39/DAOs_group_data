Details about Spark Protocol can be found here (link to the announcement).  Paragraph Summary This SPF provides funding for the launch of Spark Lend, the first Spark product we want to help launch from Phoenix Labs. Spark Lend will bring to Maker a new decentralized application that will integrate with Maker\u2019s strategic services (D3M, PSM, and DSR) into one front end to attract more crypto users and help to bootstrap the creation of the SubDAO communities. As presented in our roadmap, we want to start with a simple front-end that will allow the Maker Community to evaluate the growth of the product and according to it and based on the Community feedback, we could launch new features and products in the future. If MIP55c3-SP15, MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend, and this SPF are approved, we will be ready to launch Spark Lend by April 2023 and maintain it for up to one year. All products created by Phoenix Labs will belong to MakerDAO, including the smart contracts, the Front End, and all intellectual property.  Special Purpose Fund Name Phoenix Labs-Spark Lend launch.  Special Purpose Fund Scope To be as lean as possible, we will reuse as many Maker internal resources as possible and start with the launch of just one of the Spark Products. This budget includes all we need to launch and maintain the Spark Lend product for one year. The budget doesn\u2019t include the team\u2019s salaries as we will work on this but continue with our affiliation to our respective CUs until the ecosystem scope goes into effect. Once the framework to onboard EA is clear, we will present a complementary proposal that will include our salaries and the development of new features and products, as detailed here (link to the announcement). This budget will allow us to:  Create a new visual brand identity for Spark Lend and design and launch a landing page (information website). Launch Spark Lend contracts and front end by April 2023. Work on the product to improve the front end. Product maintenance for a year.  The current budget doesn\u2019t include costs related to smart contracts audits, gas fees, risk assessments, and marketing as we will use all the Maker available resources and CU services.  Detailed Roadmap This SPF covers everything with an \u201cIN PROGRESS\u201d or \u201cNOT STARTED\u201d status. The New Features with an \u201cIN THE ROADMAP\u201d status are not covered by this SPF and will be developed later after Maker governance approves another budget that supports Phoenix Labs in doing it.  Untitled (3)1166\u00d71482 119 KB   Budget Breakdown  Untitled (4)946\u00d7958 69.5 KB   Funding Breakdown  Funding will be done in a lump sum upon Governance Approval of the SPF. Excess funds will be held in the multi-sig until the work is complete. Unspent funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.

It would seem on the surface to introduce new elements to the status quo that share some unfortunate facts with the Ooki DAO product that is alleged by the U.S. Commodities Futures and Trading Commission to be in violation of U.S. law. There does not appear to be sufficient allocation of resources, time and provisioning for product compliance with U.S. laws, which would be difficult given the current environment of dueling agencies and enforcement actions in the absence of regulatory clarity by new legislation. If such a legal and regulatory review has been performed, please include the analysis and assessment of how the proposers expect legal and compliance risks to be allocated among its owners and MKR holders. The announced delay of launching subDAOs until 2024 gave us great comfort. In our understanding the decision related to a recognition by the majority of active MKR holders that very careful legal review of structures, products and tokenomics designs was required for the continuing success and growth of MakerDAO. Also of great importance is using the pregame to properly design for  non-legal considerations of appropriate conflicts of interest disclosures, prohibitions on self-dealing, competition fairness protections and Core resources activated for independent due diligence, review and accountability monitoring by non-conflicted MakerDAO dedicated teams. If there are groups that merit special exemptions from this approach, there needs to be a more transparent way to account for it and sufficient time for the exceptions to be evaluated by the community and Governance. This proposal seems at best pre-mature. The coordinated public announcements today on social media are worded to imply everything is a DONE DEAL and partners \u201cwill\u201d have the benefit of \u201cMakerDAO building blocks\u201d. What building blocks? This pre-announcement of something that has been worked on in stealth in \u201cfree-time\u201d is truly a disappointing development that goes against the transparency, openness and community engagement we\u2019d expect from all core contributors, especially full-time Facilitators.

This seems unfair and undeservedly punitive. We (Maker governance) are placing Maker contributors in an impossible position with this ambiguous transition period before the Endgame officially arrives. The whole success of the Endgame rides on successful SubDAOs launching innovative products and new business models (ie exactly the kind of thing proposed in this SPF). The people most qualified to do so are already involved with Maker - hence the formation of Phoenix Labs (n\u00e9e Crimson) and Viridian, etc. SubDAOs are not going to come out of a vacuum! We can\u2019t both expect all contributors to prepare to transition to Endgame, while also chastising those doing the work to prepare for what the Endgame is explicitly expecting from the workforce. I agree that for Spark Lend and other products to be funded by Maker, that will require governance approval - but, well, that seems to be exactly what this SPF is for. It\u2019s hard to see how the work is being sneakily \u201cbackdoored\u201d into existing activity given the explicit governance proposals on the forum and the fact that the vast majority of the work hasn\u2019t yet been started. Again, it seems quite unfair to blame the proposal for being \u201cpremature\u201d at the same time as blasting the team for not being transparent. Do we want potential SubDAOs to communicate their plans and proposals early, or do we not? I think we do, and I also think there\u2019s a lot to like in this proposal for those who want to see Maker grow. ",

The tone may be sharp, but we are being objective about holding the DAO to a certain standard of transparency and PRE-approvals.

If the team received some kinds of private assurances to inform how this has been developed, that should be made public.

The whole success of the Endgame rides on successful SubDAOs launching innovative products and new business models (ie exactly the kind of thing proposed in this SPF).   This is very important. Maker governance might have been too lavish in approving funds in the past, but atm we\u2019re swinging in the opposite direction. The DeFi space is blooming with innovation atm. Morpho Labs, Element Finance, and Ajna, just to name a few. Maker needs to make sure we transition well and unlock innovation. What has always attracted me the most about the Endgame Plan was the focus on using the existing talent to produce value and exponential progress instead of incremental, more-of-the-same but a bit different, tied down by a massive bureaucracy. We need to empower people to take bold risks. This is an all-star team. The proposed budget is minuscule when we take into account what is being proposed. We should applaud them for coming forward and guide them along the way to minimize double dipping and unclear responsibilities, but first and foremost, to be the most innovative and entrepreneurial they can be.

The tone may be sharp, but we are being objective about holding the DAO to a certain standard of transparency and PRE-approvals. This proposal and public relations surrounding it strikes us as having been prepared with an expectation that a Governance vote is a rubber stamp and it will be launched in April. If the team received some kinds of private assurances to inform how this has been developed, that should be made public. If we missed the public community discussion on the Forum or elsewhere of this protocol and product plan, please advise. We observe a level of development, preparation and expectation that is inappropriate when everything that\u2019s premised here in terms of organizational structure and review is based on a system that does not yet exist (Endgame) and for which documentation has only just been provided in full, but is still incomplete as of yesterday. We are always willing to risk being unpopular in our critiques and do not let affection for people on a personal level or approval of their past work inhibit the direct communication of our sincerely held views.   Gotta agree with you on the planning behind the scenes and governance vote is just a rubber stamp. 2 days to assess this kind of proposals is insufficient. ",
