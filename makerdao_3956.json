                    "content": "In Governance and Risk meeting #151, the subject of marketing Core Units came up and conversation has continued in this thread and elsewhere. As a follow-up, Content Production wants to pose a number of questions to the community to encourage conversation around what types of marketing activities the DAO wants to engage in and how the DAO would like to pursue those activities. I think one issue that stands in the way of progress in this conversation is that many of us have different ideas about what \u201cmarketing\u201d actually means. In the interest of defining our terms, we\u2019ll share a few of our thoughts on what marketing is and we want to hear from you: what does it mean to you when you talk about \u201cmarketing\u201d in the context of the DAO?  What is Marketing? People make decisions based on stories they tell themselves about who they are and how they interact with the world and good marketing is about telling stories that encourage people to make decisions that support organizational goals. In other words, marketing is about helping people find things they want and need; not tricking people into trying things they may or may not care about. Things like tweets, emails, and advertisements are products of marketing and play important roles in context but in a more general context, marketing is about implementing strategies to improve an organization\u2019s relationship with the markets it\u2019s trying to serve. If you have other thoughts or disagree, please leave feedback in the comments.  Feedback If you\u2019re a Facilitator or Contributor of a Core Unit, would you prefer to have a team or coalition of teams you can work with to do marketing or would you prefer to build an in-house team within the Core Unit, or are you considering a different approach? If there\u2019s anything we didn\u2019t mention in the polls you would like to see, please feel free to bring that up as well. The Content team will use the results from these polls to inform our activities and we hope the results can provide value to other teams interested in engaging in marketing activities on behalf of the DAO.

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but while this might be relatively easy to determine for traditional businesses, it is definitely much harder for one which is crypto-native due to a lack of relevant data? Although I am not sure as to how Maker will solve this problem, I do feel like \u201cgeneral\u201d branding should be unified across all operations except in certain cases where knowledge has been established as to customer demographics (i.e. RWA). I strongly agree that     JerryAG:  marketing is about implementing strategies to improve an organization\u2019s relationship with the markets it\u2019s trying to serve.   Communicating that Maker is ready to serve its market by presenting itself accordingly is paramount. For that, I believe the DAO must learn as much as possible about its actual and target customers.

The amount of people who are interested in governance, and DAOs, and Vaults, and have the time to keep up with everything happening at Maker is limited at best. Essentially my thought is that it\u2019s easier to breakdown these target customers into the types of interests they have. The unifying part comes in moreso with the branding (including logos, color schemes, font types, styles, cadence, and more) of different content and marketing styles. ",

So this is just me taking my own selfish bite of the apple\u2026 But I really want to see Maker more socially integrated with the non-crypto world. I know I\u2019m what passes for a Suit around here, but grassroots-style outreach to both society at large and the relevant powers that be strikes me as high return. In my mind, that\u2019s not a billboard or name plastered on something for money, but actual activities that engage people \u2014 be it sponsoring financial literacy classes, Solidity coding grants, Q&A with policy makers, or even the capybara vs dragon mascot art contest. Active engagement brings people in the door and wins friends. We need both, and we need it in heaps. It\u2019s a dangerous time to be in 4th place in what is probably a 4-way race to navigate regulations, grow market share, and simply survive. We are far, far, far behind our competitors on this frontier, and marketing needs to focus on quality and depth over quantity and breadth. I\u2019m not a marketing professional. And I hate expenses. But I also know we need marketing for branding and press, even if I am skeptical in it leading to conversions. Maker receives minimal attention and even less respect. A year ago, the Foundation was able to get a call with the OCC. The DAO gets a brusque, dismissive reply that\u2019s not even a form letter. We need advocates and we don\u2019t have them. Whatever their form. MakerDAO doesn\u2019t get to inherit the non-transferable relations that the Foundation had. It will be a monumental task to rebuild them. I hope @Kathleen comes back with something for another round, because we are having to start at the bottom with central banks and media relationships. I don\u2019t know what our marketing plan should be, but I do know we need one. I also know that we won\u2019t know in what direction to push until someone is willing to start a discussion about exactly what direction we should be going. It won\u2019t be pretty. People will be left wanting more. But we need some decisiveness about what Maker is supposed to be and where it should be in 5 years. ",

Currently, my personal answer would be sort of. I think the community generally agrees that growing (in the sense of revenue) the DAO, DAI adoption, and continued innovation are all important in different regards. I think there are a lot of unique perspectives on what we can do as a community in order to achieve those goals, as well as what is the most important. I\u2019d say there are other things some may consider more important as well. So ultimately I think the answer would be no, there is not [currently] a glaring clarity or anything you\u2019re missing (as far as I know). ",

I would answer very differently whether Maker is marketing DAI for end users or the Maker protocol for people or orgs that may want to open vaults. The way the poll is worded, this distinction is not made.   I hear your point, personally the goal of this post was not to identify specific objectives as much as community input on what \u201cuseful marketing\u201d could look like. Especially when considering the specific outcomes of these processes. Through a lot of forms of marketing, it can be difficult to directly point out the impact aside from things like likes, views, shares, and feedback; which I don\u2019t think necessarily represent the actual impact (especially over time). Absolutely appreciate the feedback. Although it was considered that perhaps this should be less ambiguous, the goal was to target these specific answers opposed to the different nuances of this conversation as a whole. (i.e. start somewhere) ",
