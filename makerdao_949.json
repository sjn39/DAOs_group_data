The intent is to monitor key metrics to allow us to instantly detect a deficit or surplus on the bridge, and monitor the DAI<>USD peg  On product:   For simple bridge  Completed a second audit that includes message cancellation and circuit breaker. The simple bridge is ready for deployment, we will start with DAI 100k limit. We will deploy the bridge on April 28 Added circuit breaker allowing MakerDAO to interrupt withdrawals in case of emergency (e.g., imbalance, break of the peg) Bridge monitoring analytics will be added shortly after the launch on April 28. We are working with Tokenflow on implementation    On Fast withdrawals  Completed the wormhole oracle proof of concept Analyzed wormhole SDK for Optimism and identified architecture differences which we would like to implement for a Starknet SDK (mainly that it should not be organized around transaction hashes but use GUID) Completed the wormhole documentation for Starknet Defined a plan for wormhole data availability to cover for the edge case where a user initiates a fast withdrawal, burns L2 DAI, and then the rollup goes down Planned for end-to-end tests including Goerli dss wormhole deployment    On wormhole teleportation  Planned for replicating vat on Starknet Executed warp tests    Amsterdam hackathon: planned to integrate the end-to-end tests with an interface allowing the users to receive their attestation and submit it on L1 to mint DAI ",

                    "content": "@flipflopflapdelegate thank you for those questions. I meant the Data Insights CU when I said Tokenflow yes We will bridge Optimism and Starknet for example by the way of wormhole teleportation but that does not require the SDK necessarily. The goal of the SDK is to provide a standardized interface to interact with dss wormhole. It\u2019s used on client side, and it would turn out to be particularly convenient if we wanted to integrate wormhole to other interfaces (e.g., a dedicated Maker wormhole interface, or other partner\u2019s interfaces) Hope that answers your questions ",
