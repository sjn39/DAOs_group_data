                    "content": " Abstract This post is intended to provide context on, and guide the community to a decision around, grant eligibility criteria as it pertains to projects with tokens. This post is a Part III follow-up & summary of existing discussions outlined in these two recent governance posts: Novel Situation #1, and Proposed Revision to Grant Eligibility Criteria. We acknowledge this is a net new policy evaluation happening in the middle of a grants round, seeking to bring near-term resolution to a policy ambiguity, which is not ideal. In doing this evaluation, we have identified the need to craft a longer-term, more deliberate & community-involved process for grants policy definition that spans across workstreams.  Context: Existing Policy One of Gitcoin\u2019s legacy eligibility criteria reads that, to be eligible for a grant on the Gitcoin platform, a project \u201cshould not have its own token or have raised over $500k in VC funding\u201d. This criteria was put into place in early 2021 before the DAO provided a strong governance model for Gitcoin Grants. The Web3 space has evolved substantially since then, and many early-stage projects now launch governance tokens at inception. These tokens often have little-to-no economic value at the onset \u2013 and, as such, questions have been raised about whether this eligibility criteria should be revised to be more inclusive to these types of projects. Currently, FDD is declining all grant applications that have their own token of any sort. This includes:  Projects which currently have a token Projects which have any mention of an airdrop or sale on their grant page or any of the links on the grant page including their Twitter, Website, or github.   Bright ID Case BrightID grant #191 was flagged by a user during GR12 as having a token. This dispute was escalated to the review team which determined that they are ineligible because they do have a token. After GR12, an appeal was raised by the BrightID team on this topic. This appeal relates to their existing grant, which has raised over $150K in Gitcoin Grants funding in prior rounds. The email outlining the appeal, which can be read in full in this post, served as a catalyst for revisiting & re-evaluating this eligibility criteria, as well as for more clearly defining the FDD Appeals process as a whole (future post to come on this).  Proposed Policy Amendment After extensive cross-workstream dialogue, as well as public discourse in the comments on the posts mentioned above, PGF & FDD propose revising the criteria as follows: A project in the Main Round cannot:  Have a token with a fully-diluted market cap of greater than $20 million Have raised over $500k in VC funding  We recognize that these criteria are somewhat arbitrary, but we believe creating an objective starting-point threshold from which we can iterate, rather than maintaining the status quo of nebulous criteria, is a) more scalable for the program long-term, and b) much clearer to current & prospective grantees. Finally, the verbiage \u201cin the Main Round\u201d was specifically included to give us the flexibility to de-couple Ecosystem & Cause Rounds from this logic in the future. Today, all QF-eligible projects on the Gitcoin Grants platform are in the main round \u2013 so this applies to all grants for the immediate term \u2013 but we may de-couple ecosystem/cause rounds in the future, such that the funding partners of those rounds can make their own decisions around eligibility for their pools.  Grants Policy Definition Process (Longer-Term) This discourse has led us to the realization that there is not clear accountability or process as to \u201cwho defines grants policy, and how?\u201d \u2013 whether it\u2019s PGF, FDD, the community-at-large, or a combination thereof, and how we collaborate and govern policy definition. We certainly want to make this a joint, community-heavy domain, and that is something we need to improve on as we continue to progressively decentralize the running of our grants programs. As a next step, PGF & FDD will come back to the forum prior to Grants Round 14 with a proposed policy definition process for discussion.  Snapshot Vote In the interim, on the \u2018Projects with Tokens\u2019 policy, we propose moving to a Snapshot Vote with two options: 1. Maintain \u201cno token\u201d status quo This would mean that we continue with the ambiguous policy (\u201ca grant should not have its own token\u201d), and leave case-by-case decisions in the hands of FDD. In this case, the Bright ID decision would be handled centrally by that group and would not continue further through governance. 2. Adopt new $20M market cap threshold This would mean that we would adopt the new policy to be implemented for all grants as of GR13. Grants previously denied in GR13 for having a token would have an option to either submit a new grant (preferred) or appeal their old grant\u2019s denial. In this case, the Bright ID decision would be made by this criteria. Given that BrightID\u2019s FD market cap is $7.6M at the time of writing, and they confirm to have not raised VC funding, they would continue on as a grantee eligible for QF in GR13. Allowing projects with tokens to not be immediately disqualified does not mean that ALL projects with tokens having a market cap under $20 million will qualify. These grants must still pass all other platform eligibility criteria. Wrap-Up Given that this post is a \u201cPart III\u201d follow-on post and that community discussions on this topic started ten days ago, we plan to move this to a Snapshot vote on Tuesday, March 22nd. This will allow us to have the decision ratified prior to the end of the GR13 dispute period. Thanks to @DisruptionJoe, @David_Dyor, @connor, @seanmac, @M0nkeyFl0wer for your collaboration & input.

But the marketcap proposal sounds equally arbitrary, doesn\u2019t it? What if a developer team creates a token, gives all of it to the community and it has $100m marketcap? They would still have kept nothing for themselves, thus would have no funding at all from the token. I would guess we would really have to do a case-by-case study, see how the token operates, how many tokens does the team have, and if it is the same team that requests the funding for the gitcoin grant. Generally the idea is not to punish anybody here. It\u2019s just to not let greedy people take money from projects that have otherwise very small sources of funding. For BrightID\u2019s case I have no idea how much they have raised from the token if there was a sale, how many tokens they kept etc. so I can\u2019t really give an informed opinion. ",

                    "content": "Lefteris, I believe the \u201c$20 million market cap\u201d is a suggestion that puts some reasonable, though arbitrary guideline that helps us start fine tuning the logic. I also think it is important to say that we are setting precedent on how we want the Gitcoin ecosystem\u2019s judicial system to work in the future. The stewards could vote to switch this model in the future so I think both avenues are safe to try. In practice, this vote will guide us on which judicial model the community prefers us to try first:  Option 1 - A separation of judicial and legislative branches where the judicial branch judges on a case by case basis setting precedents which the legislative branch can turn into policy in the future. Option 2 - A system where the policy is continually fine tuned by the votes of the community. In this model FDD uses a letter of law approach and an appeals system guides us to refine and redefine policy as we see the letter of law interpretations diverging from the community\u2019s interest.  Ideally, we would build out a system which would move the functions executed by FDD now, to be executed by the community in a distributed and fair way in the near future. For the time being, FDD would have to both supply judgements AND build the system for the community to supply judgements.  ANOTHER WAY TO FRAME THE VOTE OPTION 1 - MAINTAIN \u201cNO TOKEN\u201d STATUS QUO How it would play out for BrightID BrightID appeal would most likely be upheld and they would be allowed to participate in GR13. Unless there was significant objection, FDD is currently in favor of ruling to uphold their appeal for the following reasons. FDD has already found through our Polis surveys that the community overwhelmingly wants us to fund public goods over following the letter of the law. In this case, BrightID is clearly building a public infrastructure needed for digital democracy. Their token was an opportunity to let the community drive it\u2019s governance. The token has not provided sufficient funding to allow BrightID to continue building. How it would affect the Gitcoin Ecosystem moving forward This would set a precedent for many other appeals to be judged case by case by FDD which would act as the judicial branch of the system. Once a pattern was seen, then it would be appropriate for the legislative branch (Stewards) to create policy which would \u201chard code\u201d the bottoms up norms created by the community. I think it might help to say that option 1, letting FDD decide on a case by case basis is similar to English common law allowing the high courts to adjudicate on a case by case basis. The results of these cases comprise our legal canon which can all be used as relevant examples used to determine precedent. FDD has continued to advance how decentralized and transparent our processes are. While not near perfect yet, we have come a long way from Kevin or Joe deciding. For GR13 & 14, FDD would be deciding most cases while building a system for the community to decide in the future. In this scenario, I would push for FDD to create a tiered appeals system with the following characteristics  Creation of oversight mechanisms at \u201cappellate court\u201d level Implementation of external appeals panel (Jury duty!) High quality documentation of cases and processes to make FDD appeals process \u201cforkable\u201d  OPTION 2 - Adopt new $20m market cap threshold How it would play out for BrightID BrightID would be eligible for GR13 as they would not be in violation of any policy. How it would affect the Gitcoin Ecosystem moving forward Option 2 would fundamentally change how the policy for the Gitcoin platform (and currently the main ethereum round as well) is governed. In this system, an appeal to the current policy not matching the intended desires of the community would trigger a quick research and writing process wherein FDD & PGF would draft a policy update to be voted on by stewards. The FDD would then judge each grant application based on the letter of the law, removing an opportunity for bias. I believe this will actually help us build a scalable future. FDD is working to build tools that help the community validate whether grants match a criteria. In this type of system, the community members themselves would participate in judging whether grants met a specific criteria. FDD\u2019s role fundamentally changes from judge to builder of a trustless system which is less expensive to defend than attack.  In conclusion My vote will be for option 2. I believe it is:  Less empowering (and stressful) to FDD More scalable Fixes some fundamental problems in the US legal system by being built on better communication and value rails.  ",

Problem 2: Figure out a way to judge which projects with tokens should be eligible for a gitcoin grant and which ones should not. The proposed solution seems to try and address both which it should not. The 20m marketcap is arbitrary for the reason I explained above. It does not really address problem 2. The argument that we can change it later to make more sense does not sound like a sufficient reason to go ahead with this change. From what I understand there is a pressure of time (?) in order to make BrightID still eligible for GR13 before ratification? Then let\u2019s just try to address Problem 1 and think on Problem 2 a bit longer. The information we would need for this is how much funding does the brighID team itself has gotten from the token.  Was there a token sale? If yes how much was sold and what was received. If it was just a token creation event how much of the token does the team own?  I think we all want the same thing in the end.

It seems Problem 1 is already answered in that \u2018the community overwhelmingly wants us to fund public goods over following the letter of the law.\u2019 Since BrightId is \u2018clearly building a public infrastructure needed for digital democracy\u2019 then the surveys tell us the token issue is not the deciding factor here. I don\u2019t think this particular case then needs to be binding for all other cases. Regarding Problem 2, I also wonder to what extent the community would be happy to see issues like this delegated to FDD. I\u2019m not super closely involved in GitcoinDAO, just an observer from an academic perspective, but I actually think the degree of decentralisation currently present is quite a nice balance. While a desire to ever more decentralisation is commendable a quick survey on just how closely the community wants to be involved in refining policies around eligibility might be sensible. ",

Sure, it\u2019s equally arbitrary, but it at least begins to limit our scope to the subset of projects with tokens that actually need funding. If all projects with tokens are allowed, the aperture is super broad \u2013 projects with multi-billion dollar gov token treasuries are technically eligible. If I were a new grantee to Gitcoin trying to determine if I fit the bill, I think I\u2019d appreciate at least directional clarity.     lefterisjp:  What if a developer team creates a token, gives all of it to the community and it has $100m marketcap?

This is an interesting corner case; I haven\u2019t heard of any projects that have given 100% to community - but we should certainly have a process that accounts for and reviews situations like this. IMO, in order for the grants program to be scalable, this should be an exceptions process \u2013 where projects like this one have the opportunity to raise their hand and make their case as to why they should be included, in spite of the $20M (or whatever dollar figure) cap \u2013 rather than a standard \u201cFDD-reviews-the-issuance-details-of-every-single-token\u201d process.

The BrightID decision needs to be finalized by the end of the GR13 disputes period, which I believe is March 28th. My personal bias would be towards action and to try to come to community agreement on a more scalable starting policy that\u2019s directionally right, such that BrightID can be evaluated in that framework, rather than as a complete one-off. That said, I totally appreciate the concern around the timeline and I\u2019m good with whatever the community decides. ",

If the community feels we should discuss this more before taking action than so be it.  I support the community vision\u2026I just hope we can get quick results and not disappear into endless debates. As a reminder, during the three part progression of this topic it became clear that the BrightID entity that created the grant actually doesn\u2019t have a token.  Thus a technicality would enable us to immediately reverse the BrightID grant denial.  The entity that created and manages the $BRIGHT token is legally separate from BrightID Dao.   This quickly resolves Q2 however it may not be the best way forward as even though the 2 bright organizations are not legally linked they are connected in theory through name and actions. ",

I assume others may not have clarity here either so I want to have this discussion on next steps in public    I believe I outlined what I think will happen if we decide not to do a snapshot vote here:     DisruptionJoe:  OPTION 1 - MAINTAIN \u201cNO TOKEN\u201d STATUS QUO How it would play out for BrightID BrightID appeal would most likely be upheld and they would be allowed to participate in GR13. Unless there was significant objection, FDD is currently in favor of ruling to uphold their appeal for the following reasons. FDD has already found through our Polis surveys that the community overwhelmingly wants us to fund public goods over following the letter of the law. In this case, BrightID is clearly building a public infrastructure needed for digital democracy. Their token was an opportunity to let the community drive it\u2019s governance. The token has not provided sufficient funding to allow BrightID to continue building.   I am ok with moving forward and having FDD make the call on the BrightID case without a snapshot vote. This is what has been done in the past. The reason this case is different is because we built out an appeals process and found a legitimate case where the appeal serves as guidance to future policy. (as opposed to being a reviewer error or poor interpretation of current policy)     lefterisjp:  The proposed solution seems to try and address both which it should not. The 20m marketcap is arbitrary for the reason I explained above. It does not really address problem 2.   Because this situation is a \u201cfirst\u201d to make it this far in the appeals process FDD has built out to decentralize the decision making process, I do believe it is fair to judge both together. By saying we want FDD to make the decision or not, we establish a precedent which will be used for future appeals. I don\u2019t see how the decision here can not set a precedent, therefore there is no way to handle these separately. However, because these types of calls (grant eligibility decisions) have always happened in FDD, the way forward that does not include a snapshot vote would be for FDD to make a call and write up the reasoning for it. Then perhaps PGF could be responsible for updating policy in between rounds?

PGF & FDD Policy writes up policy recommendations based on the gov forum conversation FDD Grant Reviewers & Approver follows these policy recommendations for initial approval of new grants PGF writes up a policy update between rounds to be ratified (has the problem of bundling many policy decisions into one vote)  If we go with Option 1 or Option 2 via snapshot vote, then the decisions of FDD or the snapshot vote will have more legitimacy.

But I do feel the urgency to make a call on BrightID and I think I\u2019d encourage FDD to make the final call for now. Regarding the $20m threshold - I think we should focus on a project\u2019s treasury and not the market cap - what if the token is 100% owned by community members? This is naturally hard to measure and verify, so it\u2019s maybe not the best metric, but I struggle to think of something better. It seems like these unique 1 off cases will continue to be raised, and it\u2019s likely not possible to set a policy across the board that is fair to all, but it\u2019s also not possible to scale governance votes for each and every dispute. So given that, I\u2019d like to throw out the idea of setting a \u201cloose\u201d policy on funding/tokens for grants between GR13 and 14, with plenty of time to debate. And then maybe using governance to elect a \u201cboard\u201d of decision-makers who have the final say, independent of FDD. Governance can then vote to tweak the general policy or board members in the future when they see fit. ",

David_Dyor:  The FDD has not needed Snapshot yet and has been able to use discussion, emoji-signalling, and polls to make group decisions   This makes me a bit weary. I will trust the intention of this comment, but for policy making, bringing these items to the community and not just leveraging emoji reactions would likely be more credible. Once again, I dont have the context here, just would caution making any larger decisions on this mechanism (ie, who is invited to emote, how much information and time do they have to decide, etc.)     David_Dyor:  it became clear that the BrightID entity that created the grant actually doesn\u2019t have a token   As Lefteris mentioned, this just isn\u2019t true in spirit and I don\u2019t feel like this would stand up in any real evaluation.     castall:  no tokens were given to the team   I am really surprised to hear this. I assume the team participated in the fair launch? Eligibility criteria here would likely favor the team doing development (rightfully so!). It feels dishonest to say the team was given no tokens though   This may be the pessimist in me, but I feel like a token was launched, and was optimistically positioned as a way to fund development. Now that the markets have cooled and that is not sustainable as once hoped  the question becomes, should BrightID be allowed to receive matching  funds again. Interested in seeing the vote options as they come up  ",

I am simply trying to pull all information into this discussion and ensure nothing gets ignored.     kyle:  This makes me a bit weary   Yeah daos have a funny way of making me weary too.  Full empathy with you on this!  In all seriousness, I see the FDD decision making as a feature not a bug.  We are learning which types of decisions require various methods and info preservation.  The ability of the fdd to rapidly signal on simple matters has helped us adapt and pivot along the way.  And this is not the topic of this post.  We are discussing projects with tokens and somebody asked how the fdd would likely make the next decision.  My response was specifically to answer her question, not table fdd decision-making for inspection and critique. At risk of irritating y\u2019all, I want to point out that it can be difficult and time-consuming to achieve Dao consensus.  We are so close to actually making a beneficial policy change derived from an appropriate process it would be sad and counter-productive to cancel it, in the hopes that maybe in some hypothetical future we will sit down to address the issue again. Procrastination is the enemy and we have a great simple modification here that had been created by a PG/FDD co-lead process which involved ample public discussion.  Do we really think more pages of debate will create changes to the proposed changes?  I suggest it is unlikely and we move ahead with the suggested changes.  However, I will support the community majority position. ",

FDD Judgement of BrightID Appeal After judging this case, FDD made the decision to uphold BrightID\u2019s appeal, for two primary reasons:  The changing nature of how web 3 is using tokens such as governance tokens creates a divergence between the intentions of the community and the policy as written today. \u201cCannot have a token\u201d BrightID clearly fits the definition of a public good as infrastructure which supports digital democracy. Our Polis report which received 138 responses from the community overwhelmingly shows that the community wants us to \u201cfund public goods\u201d before worrying about the semantics of policy. While their launch of a token hoped (and still does) hope to give them a sustainable funding model, they have not achieved this status yet.  As a result of this decision, the BrightID grant will be included in GR13 and eligible for matching funds in the round. As discussed above, policy will be re-evaluated post-round, and we welcome input on that process. Thank you to @annika @David_Dyor, the stewards & community members who took their time to weigh in, and @castall and the BrightID team for going through the experience of being the first appeal to go through the full Gitcoin appeals process.  Situational Context 1 - FDD source council voted as the \u201cappellate court\u201d to decide if the appeal had merit to be heard. 2 - FDD put it to the community on the governance forum saying \u201cwe would like this to be a vote to determine precedent on how we deal with appeals at this level because it is the first case to get to this level.\u201d 3 - Because it did not get enough positive steward attention to put it to a snapshot vote, Option 0 has been selected. 4 - This post serves as communication of FDD\u2019s justification for it\u2019s decision to uphold BrightID\u2019s appeal, include them in GR13, and informs the community on potential next steps.     DisruptionJoe:  Not deciding is a decision! We might call this OPTION 0 - Maintain the status quo and DO NOT explicitly agree to FDDs authority in this domain and set clear boundaries If we maintain course, this is what the outcome might be:  FDD source council makes a decision and writes it up on the gov forum. PGF & FDD Policy writes up policy recommendations based on the gov forum conversation FDD Grant Reviewers & Approver follows these policy recommendations for initial approval of new grants PGF writes up a policy update between rounds to be ratified (has the problem of bundling many policy decisions into one vote)        DisruptionJoe:  How it would affect the Gitcoin Ecosystem moving forward This would set a precedent for many other appeals to be judged case by case by FDD which would act as the judicial branch of the system. Once a pattern was seen, then it would be appropriate for the legislative branch (Stewards) to create policy which would \u201chard code\u201d the bottoms up norms created by the community. I think it might help to say that option 1, letting FDD decide on a case by case basis is similar to English common law allowing the high courts to adjudicate on a case by case basis. The results of these cases comprise our legal canon which can all be used as relevant examples used to determine precedent. FDD has continued to advance how decentralized and transparent our processes are. While not near perfect yet, we have come a long way from Kevin or Joe deciding. For GR13 & 14, FDD would be deciding most cases while building a system for the community to decide in the future. In this scenario, I would push for FDD to create a tiered appeals system with the following characteristics  Creation of oversight mechanisms at \u201cappellate court\u201d level Implementation of external appeals panel (Jury duty!) High quality documentation of cases and processes to make FDD appeals process \u201cforkable\u201d    ",

Now that the markets have cooled and that is not sustainable as once hoped   This isn\u2019t the right narrative. $Bright token is performing much better than we ever expected, but we never expected it to cover BrightID core development. If one day it could cover the costs, great, but we never anticipated that.  That would be very optimistic indeed. Whether there is a possibility of a token or DAO treasury being used to fund core development at some future time (I hope it can, but we need other options, like Gitcoin grants) is different than saying the core team received tokens, which they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not trying to paint us in a more positive light, I\u2019m trying to dispel misinformation, so that if there\u2019s any use for this token launch to set a precedent, it can be done so accurately.     kyle:  As Lefteris mentioned, this just isn\u2019t true in spirit and I don\u2019t feel like this would stand up in any real evaluation.   I think @lefterisjp was making the point that the same people can control multiple entities and pretend to not be related.  Very true, but not the case here.  United in purpose, but not the same people.  The $Bright token airdrop was meant to be much more spread out to avoid being just the same people.  The link you shared has the right information. 10 million $Bright went to the DAO treasury. That treasury could certainly be used to fund BrightID core, but it hasn\u2019t yet, and we need Gitcoin and other grants. Most projects do take some tokens for the core team or dev team, so I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t be of more help setting a precedent for that with regard to Gitcoin grants.  My personal feeling is that should be OK if a project does that. I don\u2019t know if these will factor in at all to the updating the token guidelines, but in case you all don\u2019t know there\u2019s another token (actually two tokens) that BrightID has had since before it first applied to Gitcoin Grants in round four.  These have been used to raise funds almost exclusively for the core team. Should a grants project be allowed to charge a fee for its services and sell rights to those services?\u2013because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.  You can read about Sponsorships tokens and Subscriptions tokens.  Gitcoin has purchased sponsorships tokens to use in the trust bonus. ",

I learned a lot about DAO governance from reading this \u201ccase study.\u201d Thank you all for publishing your reasoning here.     DisruptionJoe:   Option 1 - A separation of judicial and legislative branches where the judicial branch judges on a case by case basis setting precedents which the legislative branch can turn into policy in the future. Option 2 - A system where the policy is continually fine tuned by the votes of the community. In this model FDD uses a letter of law approach and an appeals system guides us to refine and redefine policy as we see the letter of law interpretations diverging from the community\u2019s interest.    This is very good. You should think about applying for LEETH certification in LexDAO given your multidisciplinary abilities!  I believe spirit of the law is much more important than letter of the law. Compare common law with equity. Court of Chancery - Wikipedia and Estoppel - Wikipedia (especially regarding consideration and quid pro quo) Is FDD appeals a tribunal or a court? What I mean by this is can appeals revisit facts established at trial or just application of the law? Importantly, letter of the law is wet code and not dry code so interpretations will most likely include some variation between interpreters. The community should contemplate how much variation is reasonable. One if the issues that arises trying too much to avoid variation in interpretation of the law is policy cannot develop with sufficient complexity to handle matters. For instance, negligence has a ~6 element test: duty, breach of duty, cause, in fact, proximate cause, and harm. Moreover, how much judicial activism is included in application of the law, understanding no judicial activism is dysfunctional because, among other reasons, Natural language is imprecise? Statutory interpretation - Wikipedia Doesn\u2019t the \u201cT\u201d in NFT stand for token? if I make 20,000,001 \u201c$1 bills\u201d each with a unique generative art design, can I circumvent the under $20,000,000 policy\u2019s letter of the law? 10 Rarest Types of Dollar Bills - Rarest.org I hope Gitcoin considers a final appeal that is conducted by arms-length parties outside of Gitcoin, for instance a reputable ODR service. Considering Gitcoin could be served without an agreement to arbitrate, it might be a smart move. Further, if the community perceives the impartiality of Gitcoin\u2019s Snapshot as relatively low now or in the future, ODR final appeal could help bolster confidence. This is not legal advice. ",

I\u2019m digging in and learning more here, but overall I think our policy will need expert opinions to help guide the process. It must also be a joint effort between the all the teams which interact with Grants. I think we learned a lot and made great progress on our system overall. We now need to vet the processes and bring in subject matter experts to help us get to the next level. This will definitely be an outcome we shoot for before GR14. ",

Great Q. imo FDD Appeals is more like a tribunal.  We will revisit facts.  A common example relates to broken website links.  Eg:   When grantees apply the website is broken so the grant gets denied.  The grantee then fixes the website link and requests an appeal.  In these conditions the FDD Appeals absolutely revisits the \u2018fact\u2019 and upon finding a working website link recommends the appeal succeed.  Assuming no other eligibility criteria violations exist ofc. We are not so refined as to use and define ourselves by a single model.  Rather we are trying to be comprehensive, fair, and fast.  And do so in a manner approved/vetted by the Steward group & every workstream. ",
