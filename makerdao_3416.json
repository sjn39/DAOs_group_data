For those who don\u2019t know me or are unfamiliar with my posts, I\u2019ll provide some brief background and summarize my views. I\u2019ve worked in Finance/Consulting for the past ~10 years within FP&A, Corporate, Operations, and Supply Chain sub-functions. I oversee and have managed 9-digit budgets within OpEx and working capital. I\u2019m currently working for a large public company that\u2019s seen it\u2019s share price 3x and 9x over the past five and ten years respectively - through growth in cash flow and value creation. I\u2019ve been investing in public markets since 2009, initially focusing primarily on small and micro-cap investment opportunities. I\u2019ve seen a lot of compensation plans through my research digging through SEC filings. Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet\u2019s business partner that helped build Berkshire Hathaway once said, \u201cShow me the incentives and I\u2019ll show you the outcome\u201d. I believe a well-thought out and structured compensation framework will be critical to the success of MakerDAO and the appreciation of the MKR token. In my mind, a strong token compensation framework will: \u2022\tAttract and retain the best possible talent \u2022\tPromote the achievement of key strategy and financial performance \u2022\tMotivate long-term value creation; and \u2022\tAlign the interests of parties receiving token compensation with all stakeholders To achieve these objectives, we should: \u2022\tHave competitive positioning of pay versus our peers \u2022\tDeliver a significant portion of pay in the form of variable, at-risk compensation \u2022\tAlign performance measures with strategy \u2022\tUse a combination of vehicles that collectively promote the achievement of positive results, retention and sustainable long-term value creation If you\u2019re interested in expressing your views - please shoot me a message I\u2019d love to discuss.
