An open invitation to community developers This UI is an example of a front-end implementation of the three different auction types in the Maker Protocol.  It also serves as an open-source template for builders in the ecosystem interested in developing an improved version yourself! Also, please submit bug reports and improvement contributions towards the code and UX. There are good first contribution opportunities in this project for developers to get their feet wet contributing to the Maker Protocol, especially as a front-end developer.
