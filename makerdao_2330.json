                    "content": "It is desirable to onboard new collateral types that are uncorrelated with the price of ETH to create a more diversified collateral pool and to be better able to withstand drops in ETH price.  A problem is that many of these uncorrelated collaterals (e.g USDC, DGX) have a centralization risk that people are uncomfortable with.  (wBTC also has this same problem but is arguably highly correlated with ETH). One solution to this problem is to use e.g synthetic XAU or even sUSD, sBTC from Synthetix.  (I know some people view this as a competing platform, but let\u2019s ignore this issue for the sake of discussion.).  These synthetics are decentralized and their security depends primarily on the price feeds and the value of SNX (currently they require a collateral ratio of 800% to back the synthetics).  They also have the advantage that they can be auctioned instantaneously at the spot price and do not require separate markets with their own liquidity. What do people think about using sXAU, sUSD, sBTC as collateral types to improve collateral diversity without having to worry about a centralized authority that can either steal the stored collateral or black list maker deposits?

One thing I realized though is there is a different way for Maker to use what one might consider as \u2018synthetic\u2019 collateral example is cUSDC vs. USDC.   I know this adds smart contract and centralization risk.   BUT in this case since the token is not USDC directly but cUSDC we heap somewhat the circle blacklisting on to compound or a 3rd party intermediary.   Personally I trust Compound a bit more than Synthetics at this point.   But the point here is that it might be actually better to heap the centralization risk on to other parties if possible.  Heck if more DeFi protocols offer deposit tokens that represent claims on systems these actually may be a better way to offload and spread risk in such a way as to make it difficult for centralized token providers to blacklist effectively. This is completely off the top of my head thinking inspired by above post, even if I am not entirely hot on synthetix itself, conceptually the idea of using synthetic assets as deposits seems an interesting way to spread centralization risk.   The risk here is we are heaping not just centralization risk, but also second centralization as well as smart contract and liquidity risk on these things. ",

I have to agree with this, the whole system relies on the value of the SNX token. The SNX token is currently inflating in order to provide staking rewards (and incentivise liquidity) before trading fees take off. Details here: https://dashboard.synthetix.io/ Some points worth mentioning:  Only $15M synths minted. This is mostly sETH (which is subsidised through inflation on the uniswap pool) And sUSD (which is subsidised through inflation on Curve) $8M in fees is more than I expected actually, though this is from Dec 2018.

Synthetix, if they ever do release admin control of their contracts, has a significantly different design and aim from Maker. This is mostly caught up in the fact that they have only one collateral pool, which (arguably) increases both risk and liquidity.

Even if one that supposedly has a -1 correlation with ETH price? It seems to me that some of these concerns that have been discussed so far could likely be mitigated through higher liquidation ratios and/or lower debt ceilings, but that is just my opinion. ",

If we add synths, I would propose:  Slightly worse than standard collateralization (so sETH would be ~175% instead of 150%) Low debt ceiling Reasonable risk premium (due to the admin key + fundamental architecture flaws)  I think the risk here is not short term volatility but more-so synths collapsing to zero due to the system collapsing. I have plans to write-up my concerns in long form but here are some in dot point:  Admin key Chainlink oracle, N of M multisig oracle with no OSM No pricing guarantees (no funding payments, or settlement) No liquidations for undercollateralized positions, related to no pricing guarantees.  While I have a pessimistic outlook on Synthetix, there could be demand for long-term hold tokens (sXAU, synthetic shares, sDEFI etc). I just wonder if its worth the tech cost of supporting if we can\u2019t offer very attractive parameters (due to the risks) ",

A lack of a clear incentive mechanism to keep the peg on synthetix is terrifying. Even if this did give us a token with perfect negative correlation to eth it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it. Onboarding collateral types like this is also likely to increase demand for them, which means there will be more people using these synthetix tokens who do not understanding the risks they are subject to, which could cause a situation very similar to the current Black Thursday liquidation issue if something ever went wrong.
