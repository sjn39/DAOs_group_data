Over the past 21 days, the application has had over 140,000 visitors per the team\u2019s Cloudflare analytics, showing their is substantial interest in NFTs on Optimism.  image1600\u00d7574 68.5 KB  Screencap of live application on https://nfearth.exchange:  image1896\u00d7941 88.4 KB  Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://opensea.io - https://qx.app Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 1/16/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: NFT trading on Mainnet is by far one of the highest transaction generator for network \u2026 at the same time NFT on Optimism is in a \u201cfrozen\u201d stage with almost no volume at all and also lagging most of even less developed chains\u2026 We are here to change that by building a robust NFT marketplace (already live since mid-January) for the NFT ecosystem to flourish on Optimism with unique tools, features, and token mechanics that will ensure long-term sustainability. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We have spent significant time working directly with AWS technical engineering to troubleshoot scaling the application to a global level and have prepared the infrastructure to now handle tremendous traffic. With this Grant we would like to stimulate/incentivize user activity to get back life to Optimism NFT ecosystem! Nothing in this world works better than user incentives to re-start/kick start initial interest and volume! When interest will be back, we will build on momentum and keep expanding Optimism NFT ecosystem both transaction volume wise as well, generating new activity. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Please also reference our previous points on NFTs in general. We believe NFTs are a massive part of the future growth of web3 and we are sad to see that Optimism lags most/many chains in this aspect of web3! We are ready to change that and get to a state where millions of newly on-boarding users will be joining Optimism. By making a user-friendly, educational, and useful application, NFTEarth will grow the Optimism ecosystem for years to come. This Grant will directly help to kick-start interest and activity. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No. Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): We will co-sponsor Trading Incentives with NFTEarth protocols native token $NFTE (the protocols token) as well as soon we will launch additional NFTEarth native trading/staking, activity based initiatives which combined with the Grant would be exactly what is needed to kick-start active participation! but are open and willing to match with co-incentives as well. How will the OP tokens be distributed? 10% - User Education - rewards for incentivizing learning about NFTs. We will incentivize passing knowledge tests, through learn to earn, and learn by doing system thus many people will get acquainted with important factors of web3, Optimism ecosystem and NFT in general (including super important safety, web3 hygiene training) in both theory and practice! 5% - Community Generated Content - we will pass this part of the grant to active community members who will bring in the most new users to Optimism. 55% - Listing and making Offers for NFTs on Optimism\u2019s NFTEarth - as proven many times though many experiments, trading incentives are one of the best ways to initially kick-start interest and volume. After interest is established through these incentives, we will continue to build on that momentum! 30% - L1 to L2 Collection migration and new collection on-boarding. We believe that one of the crucial factors for the currently \u201cfrozen\u201d state of Optimism NFTs is lack of sufficient QUALITY projects. There are many projects on L1 which would benefit from a low cost Optimism environment! (e.g. those having: active after-mint interaction with contracts, changing collection traits, adding new elements, after mint airdrops, etc.) We are going to find best-fit projects on L1, and with the help of the Grant, drive their migration to Optimism. We will also use this part of the grant to stimulate NEW projects launching directly on Optimism as L2 native collections. We have the infrastructure ready, and additional stimulus for project creators will be highly effective in accomplishing this. We will target only vetted, quality projects. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? We will use the tokens as planned below with our activity milestone goals for the 40% upfront and 60% after reaching critical milestones (anticipated after ~1 month - see detailed breakdown below). Milestones breakdown: We have 4 primary activities; each with their own milestones that we will be monitoring - and for further clarity - we have broken down the milestones within each of the activities below.   User education: Token incentives to begin immediately to incentivize L2 NFT education and learning. Milestone achieved after reaching 1000 active users on protocol.   Community generated content and marketing: This activity is the starting point - and will be used immediately to catalyze activity; this is crucial to start generating traction for all other activities.   Listing NFTs on Optimism NFTEarth & Trading incentives: Token incentives to begin immediately to spark NFT activity within the Optimism ecosystem. Milestone achieved after 5,000 new wallets/user growth reached.   L1 to L2 Collection migration and new collection on-boarding: We will use tokens to immediately to incentivize both L1 collections and new L2 collections. Milestone achieved after on-boarding 1 established L1 collection to the Optimism ecosystem and 2 new L2 native collections have been created to accelerate described activities.   Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Please see above answers to previous questions. In short, we believe that because so many NFT creators/project owners, as well as investors/traders still do not understand the benefits of the speed and low cost advantages of L2 NFTs - once they have experience a blazing fast and cost efficient application on L2 ecosystem - they will not have any reason to leave! On the opposite - hopefully instead they will tell all their friends and thus ecosystem will continue to grow and expand! Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): NFTEarth DAO Treasury: Safe Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): Yes, I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions.

The short answer, is a combination of new users + overall growth of volume in $USD terms from marketplace activity. More detailed, this is something we have found difficult to ascertain the best metric for. Open to any and all ideas here as well! For some context though as to why it is difficult we started an XP Leaderboard campaign for the 2nd round of $NFTE airdrop season which we called \u201cQuests\u201d, and due to the nature of L2 costs being so much lower than L1, we found our algorithm for generating XP was heavily abused by bots/and or users simply doing tons of Txs. So, we refined it to only include certain collections, overall volume, and added a constraint on the time period of offers and listings. To tie this into a more specific measurement, we would target 50% of activity that OpenSea has been demonstrating within 2 months time. And so for reference in our specific case, this would mean 15,405 wallets interacting with the marketplace on a 30 day time frame, within 2 months time. We think this is a reasonable and achievable goal based on the growth strategies we have in place.

This result observed here @katie was highly unpexcpected ( in a positive way tho ) - but we can now actually begin talking about more full on real use cases for fNFTS, staked NFTS, and getting this all to L2. The implications for this are so massive we could come up with sozens of ise cases where NFT staking would benefit users and protcols!

We\u2019re underfunded, growing rapidly, and need to stay focused to win. But I do sincerely believe we can not just compete with OpenSea, but beat them, on L2.
