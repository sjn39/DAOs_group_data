It\u2019s my strong belief that in order for this forum to be effective, community-elected moderators should be put in place to help keep order over a growing conversation. I would argue that strong moderation of the yearn governance forum is what allowed key discussions to shine through and one which should be closely followed here. For those who feel like they would be a good fit, please comment below to help make the  team\u2019s life a bit easier outside of the internal discussion already being had. Please note, moderation roles are not likely to be paid at inception, but ones which may offer future benefits if and as the community sees fit. Cheers! ",

Although I\u2019d appreciate it if you could go into further detail about the role played by the moderators for yearn governance forum, means we have a good idea of the kind of standard we want moderators appointed here to adhere to. I would love it if we had a pinned thread where each of the elected moderators introduced themselves and perhaps maybe even pitched why they would be a good person to delegate Uni governance voting power to. If we have a solid team of moderators which the community trusts, I hope these people will act in the best interests of the community when voting in governance proposals and wont act on self interest.

                    "content": "Hello, my name is Jon and I\u2019m a software engineer focused in healthcare. Currently I\u2019m creating algorithms to help improve diagnosis of breast and kidney cancer. I\u2019ve been solving problems using code for almost 20 years now, and I\u2019ve been leading groups on some extremely ambitious projects over the last 5 years with great success. As the Chief Strategy Officer for a healthcare data exchange, I directed efforts which resulted in a blockchain ledger securing de-identified patient data than ran tandem to the traditional data marketplace. The CEO was adamant on switching over to a 100% blockchain data exchange (in 2017) immediately, even though it certainly would have ended in failure. The compromise I championed was running a hyperledger fabric testnet that mirrored the marketplace. The developers were relieved that they could get back to the real work, our CEO was happy, and I was able to facilitate a neural network training system to help determine intrinsic costs of medical data. When I left for greener pastures, I left the company in better shape than I found it. I helped the team function more coherently, and at the end of the day, do what was best for the bigger picture. For a while, I had political aspirations. When I was exposed to DeFi, governance, and staking a few years ago with MakerDAO, I realized that my aspirations were misplaced. I was looking at the embryo of humanity\u2019s future, thousands of disconnected ideas all naturally progressing towards a fundamentally different system. One based not in bureaucracies, back-room deals, and opaque laws and regulations; but in ad-hoc solutions, transparent cooperation, and fully justifiable regulations put forth by the only people in the system that matter\u2014those using it. I don\u2019t want to be a Community Moderator for some flair or a badge, or the potential promise of payment. I want to be a Community Moderator because I have seen what this community is capable of, and I am willing to sacrifice my time and energy to leave the community and any discussion I take part in better than when I left it, and with those involved more informed and equipped to make a decision. I\u2019m constantly taking new innovations in technology and breaking them apart, looking at the components and not just learning about what it does and how it works, but what it could do. My knowledge base ranges from cryptographic algorithms, to neural networks; augmented reality to surgical pathology; front-end and back-end both in programming, and in business\u2014taking on the face of an issue when necessary but knowing when to step back and let the crowd reach a consensus. I believe in my ability to light sparks in people\u2019s minds, and regardless of what role I play in the community I look forward to experiencing it with you all. When I step back and look at the scope of what\u2019s really being accomplished right now\u2026 while the mainstream media and legacy systems grab at straws to keep their veneers of power in place, we seem to exist in a disconnected, blissful comfort here; knowing that when something out there breaks, we\u2019ll have a replacement ready that\u2019s better, fairer, and community focused. As old paradigms fall apart across the world, it is no wonder that the DeFi community has grown so quickly. There\u2019s something ineffable about it, a power of real, actual change; the power for your vote to directly influence your community that humans have been longing for for decades. The next system that demands the attention of the world is being built right below the surface, with everyone here on the ground floor of it. Very few people truly get to live through real history like we\u2019re going to. Just that right there is enough for me to dedicate my time and precious screen space to the Uniswap community in a hands-on moderator role. It would be with excitement and humility that I would accept a moderator position should I be chosen. ",

A community-led financial ecosystem is going to bring about things in DeFi that we couldn\u2019t even imagine today. Groups of LPs, grants/funds to get more liquidity into specific tokens, allocating fees to new projects to help them bootstrap into the Uniswap ecosystem\u2026 the possibilities are almost endless. I look forward to feedback from the community as we choose moderators. I am unsure if it is a voting process, or if core team members will be choosing but I am available for discussion regarding my history of moderating communities, work in the crypto space, or anything else that would help give people insight into who I am and the strong set of leadership skills I bring to the table when it comes to helping moderating the community.
