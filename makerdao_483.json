                    "content": "We believe that a currency can never achieve the status of Universal Currency, but a pure unit of value can. We are building that unit of value: The Unit. We are creating a crypto-native community-managed indexed unit of account to replace \u201cstable coins\u201d in the long term. Currently, we use The Unit to benchmark portfolios. Later we will also launch a gamified fund pegged to The Unit. Defi projects now use USD as the unit of value. However, USD is a fiat currency foreign to our space. So why are central banks\u2019 currencies continuously used as a measure of value even in our space? Right now, USD is the glue that brings all projects together. But should a closed source currency be the focus of our attention? We think it shouldn\u2019t. Instead, an indexed unit of value that\u2019s not a currency is needed to unite all of our networks. Even though there will be a The Unit DAO aiding the development of The Unit, The Unit will be able to be replicated and maintained by everyone. The Unit is an index including the most significant portion of the crypto market. Our newly redesigned website, https://www.theunit.one, describes what we are doing in more detail. We propose a token swap to help fund the development of The Unit and tighten our partnership. We can discuss the details of the token swap below. You are also able to join the whitelist for our IDO here The Unit. Benefits to MKR hodlers:  MKR holders participating in this proposal will receive an airdrop from The Unit governance. MakerDAO governance will receive a reward swapping tokens with an earlier stage project like ours, opening itself for potential gains.

                    "content": "It appears to me what \u2018The Unit\u2019 is proposing to be is like an ETF.    The point is that such instruments have to be backed by holding assets that have strong correlations to the index pricing components \u2018The Unit\u2019 will be constructed from.    If it doesn\u2019t do this then it will require huge capital to manage the price of all the floated liquidity of \u201cThe Unit\u201d.   Think of it like a PEG price that floats around because there is no underlying. My questions are two fold. Is the treasury of \u201cThe unit\u201d going to hold underlying assets that reflect ownership stakes in weighting components according to weight. (like a weighted index fund) What pricing oracles are going to be used?    It seems like the whole issue here will be oracle costs on all of your underlying and either buying or selling components to maintain valuation weighting of the treasury backing \u201cThe Unit\u201d as an index. Frankly my reaction to the above is for \u201cThe Unit\u201d to come back after it establishes itself.   Also it is my impression that \u201cThe Unit\u201d isn\u2019t going to be a stable anything but will price float all over the place and owning the Unit will be like owning a OIL or a S&P ETF. What is a useful unit of value is going to be a difficult metric and the only reason the USD is preferred is because almost all other units of account or trading happen in those particular units of value.

Yes, the treasury of The Unit will hold the underlying assets of The Unit index, and we are partnering with Chainlink to create the data feeds necessary to run The Unit.
