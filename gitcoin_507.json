Some folks feel it was an unreasonably short amount of time to allow the community to claim their tokens, I\u2019m not here to support one side or the other but I am interested in discovering the will of the community. According to @owocki  we used an Ethereum signed message service to manage the claims, and the team didn\u2019t want the liability of running it for more than  30 days.  So those are just facts, and now according to @ceresstation the remaining tokens have been sent to the treasury that is controlled by the existing token holders. So the question is, do we feel that it is reasonable to open up a second claim window for eligible Gitcoin handles who missed the drop to claim their $GTC ? I don\u2019t want to jump into a vote right away, so I created this post to gather feedback and soft consensus before we move to snap-shot. Please add your thoughts below as we work towards a solution that best serves the interests of the community. ",

As we already discussed in Discord I strongly believe we should open the claiming up again and put it in an indefinite timeframe. There is really no reason (imo) to limit claims in a specific time frame. As long as we have a list of ethereum addresses and claiming amount per address I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do a \u201cnormal style\u201d contract airdrop where each user could claim their amount from the contract. My point of view is from someone outside of gitcoin core so I may be missing something pretty obvious that makes this impossible from a technical perspective. ",

I think there should be a deadline to claim tokens. But it should likely be a significant period. As far as exactly how long, I\u2019d suggest just before or equivalent to the 2 year vesting period included for team and investors. This is rather arbitrary but is a clearly significant period, and would align with other increases in future circulating supply, while also preventing a large # of the tokens from effectively being burnt.

There is really no reason (imo) to limit claims in a specific time frame.  FWIW the ESMS (Ethereum signed message service) we ran had a private key on it that authorized any claim to proceed (there were other security measures in place but this key signing was a big part of it).  When designing the initial drop, we felt that this service was inevitably a honeypot for an attacker (given the importance of this drop, we took a very paranoid approach and we designed for both external attackers and also protected against potential inside jobs) who might want to drain the contract of GTC and that shutting it down was the only way we could be sure we didnt have to cautiously guard it. Our engineer Zac Wolff who worked on the ESMS is gonna drop a blog post with details of this system early next week I\u2019m told. I dont want to weigh in on whether there should be a second drop or not, just providing context on the above! ",

If you were inactive for 30 days while GTC was the talk of the town, I would argue you are not actively engaged in the community. If there are any recipients who missed the claim window but are still active, I would vote that we slot them into as Stewards and reward them through Seasons - rather than relaunching the whole claims system for those who are not even aware of it existing. I very much resonate with making sure that everyone who created value for Gitcoin is able to earn in, but would suggest we focus attention on rewarding those who are engaged moving forward rather than those who may not be around any longer.

There is no guarantee for the majority of the remaining to be claimed during the second claim (whether another 30 days or 1 year) so \u201cwhy not third\u201d will come up again.   I agree that there should be no \u201ctime-limit\u201d on this claim window, so it needs to be different than the previous airdrop. I might suggest a flat amount per user that each person can claim for activity with an Etherscan txn proving they contributed to a grant before the airdrop cut-off time. Just one possible solution      matthewcarano:  \u201cif\u201d a secondary claim period is warranted to please also consider \u201chow\" it might be administered from a technical, comms, and support perspective. As well as \u201cwho\u201d might administer it.   This is another great point from someone who understands the communication efforts that go into doing an airdrop, trying to ensure everyone knows about it is essentially impossible, but ensuring someone is heading up the communication efforts is something we must lock in before moving forward      JTraversa:  I think there should be a deadline to claim tokens. But it should likely be a significant period.   I think we need to discuss alternative structure that rewards people for diving in moving forward, not necessarily focus so much on lost contributions for people in the past, more thinking required here      lefterisjp:  As long as we have a list of ethereum addresses and claiming amount per address I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do a \u201cnormal style\u201d contract airdrop where each user could claim their amount from the contract.   After speaking with the $GTC launch team there are a variety of potential claim errors that would each require deeper investigation, something that no-one, myself included, is in a position to do. It\u2019s either a one size fits all solution or nothing at all. We can speak on these claim issues at length in a call if you like  I\u2019ll outline the claim issues here briefly though:   Group 1: People on the distribution list but could not claim.   Group 2: People are not on the airdrop distribution list but did contribute to a grant/ participated in a hackathon/ or participated in Kernel before the cutoff date.   Group 3: People who missed the eligibility cutoff date. Didn\u2019t claim within the 30 day window cutoff.   So the discussion needs to be around 2 things, how can we incentivize these people to keep contributing and how can we verify that they were in-fact eligible for the airdrop in the first place. It will require some support and documentation from the Gitcoin Team, who is already stretched thin and some support from the existing token holders to support such a distribution from the treasury. So far I have not seen strong support for the second claim window to even proceed, but we have 3 more days until this goes to snapshot so let\u2019s see  ",

What I don\u2019t see is anyone who is qualified or willing to lead the effort in creating the second distribution window\u2026 If I\u2019m mistaken please by all mean chime in here, but at this moment I don\u2019t see this proposal having enough support to move to a snapshot vote. I want to avoid the situation where people are voting for something they don\u2019t have the full details on. If anyone is willing to put together a reasonable and well thought out proposal and lead the effort that would be required to organize this second claim window please speak up. Just saying \"Gitcoin should do this\" is not a suitable response  We are all Gitcoin now , your voice matters, and your efforts count as much, if not more, then the Gitcoin Core Team ! That being said, I brought up this topic of discussion to get a better perspective on the situation but I have no intention of leading the effort to make it come to fruition. I don\u2019t have the time and I don\u2019t honestly see the ROI from investing time here that could be spent in other areas of Gitcoin that need support and guidance from the Stewards. I would encourage people to look forward, not backwards and find a way to become part of one of the existing work-streams, start earning $GTC, and in no time at all you will make up for the $GTC you lost by missing the airdrop. Lastly I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind, an airdrop is a gift  not an expectation. Gitcoin provides valuable services to the community of open-source developers and digital creatives, one that funds literally 100\u2019s of projects quarterly. We want to focus on that kind of impact, we won\u2019t get it right \u201cevery time\u201d but if we can strive to improve from our short-comings then we are on the right track  ",

I managed to claim the gift, but at the very last minute - I\u2019m sympathetic towards those who may have missed the deadline entirely. But I do not have the technical skills or knowledge for how to organize such a second window. Even if I did come up with a proper approach for establishing such a window, many GTC-holders would oppose any sort of new claim window, making such an effort rather pointless. I suspect most of the pro-\u201csecond airdrop\u201d people are in the same boat. If we cannot solve this past mistake, then I don\u2019t think we can credibly say that we are on the \u201cright track\u201d. If the community cannot disincentive itself from making mistakes, they will certainly make them again. There will be no reason to fix shortcomings, so they will be no improvements made. That being said, I can understand arguments about it not being a good ROI for the project as a whole, or how increasing the $GTC claim rate by merely 20% might not be worthwhile. Therefore, it\u2019s probably a good idea to move forward. But this is still a shortcoming, and we should strive to do better next time. ",

That being said I think people are massively underestimating the effort required to improve the airdrop rate by 10-20% and missing the opportunity to ensure that these funds are spent on creating value for Gitcoin. Sure some people missed out and that\u2019s really unfortunate, what\u2019s done is done though. We can\u2019t go back and update the terms of the initial airdrop.

Yalor:  the funds are now inside the DAO Treasury, so it is actually up to the stewards.   However, we can still make the decision to delegate the operation to the Gitcoin team so it literally comes down to the fact that Gitcoin team have no time to do so and I don\u2019t think this is a type of work that should be delegating to someone else. The communication part cannot be delegated as you can\u2019t give the email list to stewards either.     Yalor:  Versus finding some way for people to earn those tokens by contributing today?   It sounds like you already answered that this is the way to go :-). ",
