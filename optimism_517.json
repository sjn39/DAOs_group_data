To support tokens Developer use Either GETH [ Go Ethereum Client], Or use Hdwallet+ [Moralis or Other Public APIs] Known Issues with Geth.  Security: Geth itself isn\u2019t protected by nature, Additional security like NGINX or a firewall is required. Multichain : Geth /Parity does not have More than one chain.
