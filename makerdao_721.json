                    "content": " Context As part of the discussion around what to do with SourceCred, we present here a set of options and recommendations to encourage governance engagement within the community with greater precision and effectiveness. Posts in the Off-Chain Governance Incentives Set  Off-Chain Governance Incentive Options SourceCred Report SourceCred and Coordinape Tool Comparison List of Options and Recommendations   Objectives for Reference A: Retention - Retain newer members of the community and compensate their time and energy. B: Governance Initiative - Encourage community members to take initiative and get more heavily involved in the off-chain portion of Maker Governance. C: Delegation Engagement - Encouraging meaningful forum engagement from Recognized Delegates. Off-Chain Governance Incentive Options 1. New SourceCred Instance  Create a new SourceCred instance specifically for Recognized Delegates. Create a new SourceCred instance and operate one for some or all individuals paid by the DAO, and one for community contributors.  Pros:  Separate budgets. More transparency. Greater predictability and flexibility in the allocation of incentives.  Cons:  Separation in two instances does not ensure greater participation or encourage community engagement. Greater management and operational costs.  2. Exclude Groups from SourceCred  Exclude core unit facilitators from SourceCred. Exclude core unit members from SourceCred Exclude Delegates from SourceCred  Pros:  Prevents Core Unit members getting double-paid and reducing payouts to other contributors. Facilitators are already paid and mandated to communicate actively with the MakerDAO community. Delegates are already paid. SourceCred could provide input into that payment rather than paying out to delegates as part of SourceCred.  Cons:  On-going maintenance cost, adding and removing accounts as employment status changes across the DAO. Causes issues when an individual goes from excluded->included due to how SourceCred tries to do catch-up payments. Excluding delegates may be counter-productive to objective C. We want to incentivize delegates to engage in the forum.  3. Limit Rewards from SourceCred  Limit Core Unit Facilitator rewards from SourceCred with a threshold. Limit Core Unit Member rewards from SourceCred with a threshold. Limit Delegate rewards from SourceCred with a threshold.  Pros:  Incentives placed in a more efficient manner with contributors not affiliated with the DAO receiving larger SourceCred payouts.  Cons:  Risk of Sybil abuse by employees of the DAO to avoid limits Core Unit Members and Core Unit Facilitators less incentivised to engage with the community  4. Reduce / Remove SourceCred  Reduce payout budget for SourceCred Remove payout budget for SourceCred No longer maintain SourceCred  Pros:  Reduction in the budget will reduce perceived overpayment in situations where there are only a small amount of engaged and active contributors. Allows budget to be used to trial or run other off-chain incentive options. Removing all payments, or the entire system would remove the ongoing maintenance costs.  Cons:  Individuals currently benefiting from SourceCred would no longer benefit (or not as much) SourceCred provides useful information in the form of Cred scores separately from issues of monetary incentive that would be lost if we abandoned it completely. Would reduce the incentives for delegates to be very active in the community if these were not replaced in some form. A number of upfront costs paid in relation to SourceCred would no longer provide much benefit if it were completely removed.  5. Delegate Engagement Metric  Use SourceCred distribution to count towards another delegate metric. Use Gives (Coordinape) distribution to count towards another delegate metric  Pros:  Encourage Delegate\u2019s engagement. Add a new indicator of the Delegates tracking performance, making the evaluation of their contributions more accurate.  Cons:  More work to track and produce delegate metric reports. Greater management costs for option B since Soordinape is likely to have an ongoing management cost than the SourceCred instance.  6. Direct Proposal Incentives  Incentivise successful MIP proposals + sub proposals directly. Incentivise successful signal proposals directly.  Pros:  Directly helps with objective B in encouraging community members to trigger governance processes that can have tangible outcomes. Should result in better community knowledge of the governance processes.  Cons:  Risk of spam proposals, though this should be partly mitigated by the \u2018if successful\u2019 clause. Some upfront cost to develop a framework to determine how proposals are rewarded, especially where there are multiple authors or contributors. On-going maintenance cost, though not hugely problematic given the existing GovAlpha involvement in the governance processes.  7. Coordinape  The Recognized Delegates can set up their own Coordinape Circle and value the collaborations endogenously. Create a Coordinape Circle with all the Core Units and Recognized Delegates and distribute the Gives horizontally among all the MakerDAO-affiliated people  Pros:  It generates direct recognition of each other\u2019s value by manually allocating Give between members. Indicator of the value that Core Unit Members bring to their working groups Sybil resistant.  Cons:  Doesn\u2019t scale well. Although a Circle can have many members, they are thought to be used for smaller groups where members interact with each other since it can become difficult to remember contributions from tons of users. Potentially more management cost.  Considering the options presented, GovAlpha\u2019s recommendations are described in (1) below. Additionally, there are two mutually-exclusive sub-recommendations described in (1a) and (1b), GovAlpha recommends adopting one of these sub-recommendations.   Exclude Core Unit Facilitators, Core Unit Members, and Recognized Delegates from existing SourceCred payouts.  With this, we propose to solve the problem of misplaced incentives. Prevent MakerDAO affiliates from receiving double payouts and reducing payouts to other contributors. Additionally, Facilitators are already paid and mandated to actively communicate with the MakerDAO community. Finally, Delegates are also already paid and SourceCred could provide information about that payment instead of paying them as part of SourceCred. This action is aimed at meeting the retention objective prioritizing newer members of the community with better compensation for their time and energy.  Reduce payouts budget for SourceCred  This will help to reduce perceived overpayment in situations where there are only a small amount of engaged and active contributors. Also, allows the budget to be used to trial or run other off-chain incentive options.  Use part of the SourceCred budget to incentivize successful MIP proposals + sub proposals directly.  This directly helps with the objective of incentivizing concrete governance actions, encouraging community members to trigger governance processes that can have tangible outcomes. We also believe that this action represents an opportunity that can result in a better community understanding of governance processes.  Use the cred distribution across recognized delegates to determine a third delegate metric (engagement.)  Engagement has become an important part of the Delegates role. Although the two delegate metrics we have currently (communication and participation) do a good job of tracking the bare minimum of a delegate\u2019s responsibilities there may be room for a third metric that can track meaningful engagement in the community. This will help to show the community, in a more comprehensive way, the complexity of an increasingly vital task for our governance, while systematically ensuring and encouraging active Delegates participation through GovAlpha tracking. Recommendations 1a:  Slightly increase existing delegate compensation to balance removed access to SourceCred rewards. Use the third delegate metric (engagement) as input into the existing delegate compensation formula.  These initiatives seek to improve the compensation of the Delegates via a new direct incentive as a counterpart for a new metric that formally commits them to engage as part of their obligations. Recommendations 1b:  Create a new SourceCred instance for Recognized Delegates and divert some of the SourceCred budget to this instance.  Change the payout formula to 100% recent contributions    This alternative proposes to divert a part of the SourceCred budget for a new Delegates instance but adjust it to reward only the most recent contributions, maximizing incentives for consistent engagement.    How to manage off-chain governance incentives regarding Recognized Delegates  Recommendations 1a Recommendations 1b Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps We appreciate all your comments and feedback. In the following weeks, GovAlpha will write concrete proposals to submit them to the community vote. ",

This proposal seems underspecified with respect to the delegate compensation formula. It seems plausible that some quiet months would attract little, even no opportunities for successful governance proposals. Would you calculate a proportion of total engagement? For example, suppose there were 3 successful governance actions in Jan 2022 (I have no idea of the actual count). Suppose MakerMan was responsible for 1 and Schuppi responsible for 1 and a non-delegate responsible for the 3rd. What numbers are input into the delegate compensation formula? ",

Our intention is to first understand what the community thinks about the possibility of implementing this modification, that\u2019s why we implement the informal poll. This third metric would use the information of the Cred scores that the Delegates would continue to generate by the logic of their activity within the forum.  All this, beyond the direct governance actions that they may propose, which, as for the rest of the community, would be rewarded regardless of the performance of this metric. The reasoning behind this is to free up SourceCred\u2019s budget for the rest of the community, excluding Delegates (retention), while also compensating them for their meaningful participation within the community, making the tracking process more complete and capable of evaluating a very important aspect of their role as Delegates.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a logical thing to double pay someone who is directly employed by the DAO. If your job is related to being active on the forum why should you be compensated double with something that was not designed for that. I think you are wasting the entry to more players within the forum, I understand that the vast majority of newbie will not bring quality. But that\u2019s why the community is there to collectively polish what really contributes to the development of the DAO, the incentives are what catch the user to develop to create and motivate him to continue participating.

Indirectly, due to their role within the community, they have been absorbing an important part of the rewards that SourceCred grants. This has proven to be both problematic and an opportunity: problematic because it has favored the concentration of payouts, potentially hindering the ability to retain new players, but at the same time, it gives us the opportunity to build a formal system that track meaningful engagement in the community Proposition 1a seeks to free up those SourceCred payouts for other members of the community while also attempting to build an accountability mechanism to systematically assess delegate participation outside of the SourceCred budget.

Puzzler:  For employees, how many people get source credit now that are not employees? Is there many people here on the forum that are no employees of some variety?   I think the problem is not how many people, who have opted for SourceCred, work or not in the DAO, but 1) what level of concentration exists in SourceCred payouts, 2) how many within that handful of users are already being paid by the DAO, directly or indirectly, and 3) determine whether or not those contributions are motivated by the incentives that SourceCred offers, or rather by the tasks/obligations involved with their previous relationship with the DAO.
