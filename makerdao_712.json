However, we are going to build some RWA related UIs, so we might use IPFS/ENS at some point in the future if the need is there. @George_Goognin Our tool (Shortcut) is not for public consumption, but we recently started sharing the overarching milestones and updates on a biweekly basis which contains screenshots from Shortcut     CES Sprint Update #1 (2022/Q1 - Jan 31st to Feb 11th 2022) Collateral Engineering Services       As defined in the Collateral Management Lifecycle (CML) post, the life cycle implies two big focus areas for CES: Collateral Onboarding and Collateral Maintenance. Within these areas we categorize our output into a set of deliverables(COD1-3, CMD1, CMO1).
