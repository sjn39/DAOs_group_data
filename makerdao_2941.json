The Maker Community needs to start discussing and deciding on how to build incentives into DssGov\u2013For me personally, I am hopeful that more community members will come up with great ideas, and those ideas will be innovative. We cannot sit back and wait for the Maker Foundation to implement any type of incentives\u2013hence, it is our Duty to make it happen. With that in mind, I want to get this topic to warm-up/get the ball rolling sort-of-speak. So, let\u2019s do an informal poll on comments/opinions that I believe are good ideas on how to incentivize MKR Voters. This Poll is based on super awesome suggestions made by our community members. Again, we the Community need to hear you\u2019re opinion, as well as your ideas. This will be helpful in getting the ball rolling. I hope to see more Polls like this one, we need to motivate and gauge the Community on implementing incentives in 2021. I believe we can ALL agree on that. Here are some topics/suggestions/comments that have been throwned around: Combine locking with voting incentives (so you earn money when you vote and have locked MKR)     Agree Disagree Abstain     0 voters     Use the Strategic Reserves to stack the cash during the year and distribute it only to MKR that are stacked on the gov contract. This can be in the form of MKR bought on the market.     Agree Disagree Abstain     0 voters     Use MIP13c3-SP3: Declaration of Intent - Strategic reserves fund (SRF) to incentivize for Eth Gas Transactions and there\u2019s no need to payout MKR Voters     Agree Disagree Abstain     0 voters     When choosing the Type of incentive that the Maker Community should implement, what is more important, the Game Theory, or the Economic Theory?     Game theory (gamification) Economic design theory  (monetary reward) Both Abstain     0 voters     Do you believe incentives for MKR Voter can lead to abusive behaviour?     Agree Disagree Abstain     0 voters     If you believe incentives should include earning money\u2013what currency should be used to payout MKR Voters:     DAI MKR ETH Abstain     0 voters     If you have ideas on how we can incentivize MKR Voters, please comment below and thank you for your participation!

                    "content": "Thanks for this post. I voted. I have only one remark about this (I abstained):     flipflopflapdelegate:  Use MIP13c3-SP3: Declaration of Intent - Strategic reserves fund (SRF) to incentivize for Eth Gas Transactions and there\u2019s no need to payout MKR Voters   Rather than subsidising Ethereum fees, I think it\u2019s about time to start thinking/discussing on how to vote on L2 solutions. The following is an \u201cexample\u201d of solution. It is not something that should be done urgently as opposed to the discussion being pushed in this thread, which needs to move fast(er). It is just an example to show what can be done with L2. It seems less wasteful than subsidising Ethereum fees. Example:   In order to vote you need to lock MKR for a period of \u2018maturing\u2019 time (say, 1h or 1day or 1week). This also prevents flash-loans attacks.   After the MKR has \u2018matured\u2019, it is possible to bridge it to xDAI-Network (only one Ethereum tx) and obtain \u201cmatured MKR on xDAI\u201d.   Voting happens on the xDAI-Network with the bridged \u2018matured MKR on xDai\u2019 tokens. It is basically fee-less.   Whenever you want, you can get back your Ethereum MKR tokens using the Bridge.   Repeat.   REMARKS:  The bridge infrastructure already exists, and it has been audited (by xDAI developers and 3rd party auditors) MakerDAO is a validator of the Network. See other thread about this topic. Since the fees are negligible on xDAI, we could have some many other Governance things onchain compared to now. Including badges, daily SourceCred payments (as opposed to monthly, due to fees), etc. No need to say, the \u2018gas\u2019 token of xDAI-Network is DAI.  ",

To this, definitely lean toward the penalize non-voters camp. The \u201crich get richer\u201d echos in my head. The whales of MKR rightfully control the system; however, if compensated, that \u201clead\u201d will likely never change. Alternatively, penalizing a lack of voting participation can actually make sense in my view as those not in the voting contract are not participating in governance. However, this will cause other game theory impacts. E.g. If so many people move their MKR to the voting contract and just vote blindly to not be diluted. It does however also cause the MKR price to move is we remove liquidity to be put in the voting contract. Which to select and why? I believe the answer painfully is somewhat to do nothing. It is important, but this issue is somewhat secondary to the state of MakerDAO as a whole and the ever-present risk that the DAO is exposed to by stablecoins. We could spend months sorting out how to maximize the MKR voting game theory. In the end, if it doesn\u2019t benefit the whales, it won\u2019t pass. During this valuable window (in my eyes), we should focus all eyes on how to bring on collateral (of all types, farming, on-chain, off-chain). If DAI is truly on an exponential expansion path, we NEED to get collateral code red. Relying on ETH won\u2019t get us there (and if it does that would be awesome\u2026 but I don\u2019t think it would be prudent for the community to use hope as the strategy of choice). MIPs like the one @equivrel just submitted are precisely what is needed from the community as whole. We just need any all-hands to realize that collateral (a LOT OF IT) on-boarding is just essential for the project to be valuable (and by the project I also mean the MKR token itself). Granted, I know the onboarding has been prioritized and we do have a process. My point more than anything, is that spending our scarce resources (time) on voting theory should be secondary to identifying collateral on-boarding bottlenecks. The project depends on our ability to keep collateral growth ahead of DAI issuance (and ideally collateral with sustainable credit demand such that the protocol can be compensated for the associated risk. /fin ",

I think scaling needs to happen ASAP by onboarding more collateral, encouraging more voter engagement, and minimizing transaction fees using xDAI for the time being. ",
