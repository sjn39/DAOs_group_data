Paragraph Summary MIP83 is a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set that configures the Clusters of the Launch MetaDAOs. This enables groups within the Core Units to begin preparations to restructure as MetaDAOs which is a de-risked form of scaling the Decentralized Workforce available in the Endgame.  Component Summary MIP83c1: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster Definition Defines Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters. MIP83c2: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster State Overview List of clusters, their codenames, their MetaDAO Class, and their Cluster Facilitators MIP83c3: Modify Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster state (Process Component) Defines the process for modifying the state in MIP83c2.  Motivation The Endgame Plan has been discussed in the Maker Community for more than 6 months and is now going up for a vote with the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. The Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters MIP is a required part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set, and it sets up the MetaDAO Clusters to begin work immediately on preparing for the Endgame Plan Launch.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP83c1: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster Definition A recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster is a formally recognized MetaDAO Cluster led by a Cluster Facilitator that is mandated to prepare an onboarding proposal (Cluster Proposal) to a future MetaDAO alongside their regular work in the Decentralized Workforce. The Cluster Proposal will go to a vote in the MetaDAOs own governance process after the Endgame Plan Launch has occurred and initial MetaDAO tokens have been distributed.  MIP83c2: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster State Overview This Component provides the official list of clusters with their codenames, their MetaDAO Class, and their Cluster Facilitators. The part of MIP83c2 that is modifiable by MIP83c3 begins below this line:  Crimson (Creator): TBD Vermillion (Creator): TBD Maroon (Creator): TBD Magenta (Creator): TBD Viridian (Protector): TBD Spring (Protector): TBD  The part of MIP83c2 that is modifiable by MIP83c3 ends above this line.  MIP83c3: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster Amendment Process This process component establishes the process to overwrite the state of the modifiable part of MIP83c2, making it possible to change the number of Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters, their names, their class, and their Cluster Facilitators. MIP83c3 Subproposals enter the Monthly Governance Cycle. They must use the MIP83c3 subproposal template.

If any new cluster(s) are being added through this modification, this section must reference their cluster announcements.   New state  This section contains the new complete list as it will appear in MIP83c2 if the subproposal is passed.  ",

                    "content": " MIP83: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters This is a summary of the contents of this proposal and its impact, from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  MIP83 is a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. The proposal aims to restructure groups within the current Core Units into MetaDAOs, establishing nine MetaDAO Clusters with their codenames and MetaDAO Class. It is divided into three components that define, enumerate, and allow for the modification of this new structure:   MIP83c1 defines MetaDAO Clusters as preliminary teams led by incubating MetaDAO Facilitators that are authorized to use their resources in the Core Units to prepare proposals for onboarding to the Launch MetaDAOs.  MIP83c2 provides the initial official list of Clusters. It consists of five Creators, two Protectors and two Governors.  MIP83c3 is a process component to modify MIP83c2, allowing amendments to be made to the original proposed structure. This process component is yet to be fully fleshed out with its template and subproposal parameters.   If this proposal is ratified, it will set the parameters for the transformation of the current workforce structure. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

After RFC and formal approval by Maker governance, it will be submitted to the Indigo MetaDAO for a vote on Deco Cluster Onboarding. Of course, this is contingent on the approval of the endgame MIP set. The Deco Recognized Cluster has already chosen both a qualified Indigo Facilitator and a Indigo Contributor Team Lead with the view of maintaining continuity in the management of the present Deco Contributor Team. The Deco Core unit is also assessing whether other core units and contributors may be an appropriate fit. ",

Things like: what roles are initially present, expected responsibilities, interaction (or not) with other metadaos, constraints on business, the definition of intangible value etc   Highly highly recommend a legal audit What levels of governance will be owned by the MetaDAOs versus Maker core? If we are still using the executive vote mechanism to pass MIPs\u2026 how do the governance systems interact? How do the budget and incentives work when metadaoes form?
