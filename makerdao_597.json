This MIP adds a small payout process.  Small payouts can be made without delay from the Core Unit\u2019s operational wallet. No need for bounty hunters to wait for a monthly executive spell. IS-001 Core Unit decides which payment process to use.  This amendment would increase the CU\u2019s budget by 100 000 * 115% = 115 000 DAI per month. In addition, there are some minor corrections:  Add a budget line item for gas fees Round up the Facilitator\u2019s compensation to a round number of USD (no cents)   Amended MIPs and Components  Immunefi Security CU DAI budget Bug Bounty Program   Amendment Pull Request  PR containing the amendment  ",

This gives (more of) the community more time to evaluate the amendment and share feedback. This proposal is now eligible to enter March\u2019s Governance Cycle. * You may notice that the period lengths specified in the process component are different from these. The reason is that those period lengths are currently being overridden by MIP2c2. ",
