Paragraph Summary MIP108 establishes the Growth Scope Framework. This includes marketing, public relations, education, and awareness campaigns. All rules for Growth for the DAO are contained in this framework, including the procedures of the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council.  Component Summary MIP108c1: Preamble Contains the Preamble to the Growth Scope Framework. MIP108c2: Scope Framework Articles Contains the Scope Framework Articles for the Growth Scope Framework. MIP108c3: Responsible Facilitators Contains details on the Responsible Facilitators for the Growth Scope Framework. MIP108c4: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process Contains details of how the Growth Scope Framework can be amended.  Motivation The Growth Scope Framework is necessary to define the Scope as per the Maker Constitution.  Specification  MIP108c1: Preamble The Growth Scope Framework covers marketing, public relations, education, and awareness campaigns.  MIP108c2: Scope Framework Articles  1: The Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council  1.1: The Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council definition The Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council is a group of Growth Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Growth Scope Framework.  1.2: Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council membership management Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.   1.2.1: The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.     1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be Growth actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Growth Scope is covering.     1.2.3: The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to 10.2.3.1:.     1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.     1.2.5: The current approved Advisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element 1.2.5.1.  1.2.5.1:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Current list of Advisory Council Members: * N/A \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    1.3: Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council projects and funding The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.   1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.     1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.     1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.     1.3.4: The Responsible Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.     1.3.5: The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.  1.3.5.1:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:     Quarterly Budget (DAI) Method of Distribution Maximum Limit (DAI)     0 Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months 0     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4    2: The Implementation of the Growth Scope Framework through Software The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.  3: Maker and Dai rebrand  3.1: Maker and Dai rebrand The Growth Scope and the Growth Core Unit is tasked with rebranding Dai and Maker to prepare for a large scale public education push to promote the benefits and changes created by Endgame and the Maker Constitution.  MIP108c3: Responsible Facilitators The Responsible Facilitators of the Growth Scope Framework are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.  MIP108c4: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process During the pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.

                    "content": "    rune:  MIP108c1: Preamble The Growth Scope Framework covers marketing, public relations, education and awareness campaigns.   The Growth scope framework outlines the processes, rules and incentives necessary to promote and enable the growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem. This includes initiatives to attract new users, expand the reach of MakerDAO and increase the number of active participants in the ecosystem. The Growth scope framework should include the following components:  Marketing and outreach strategy: A comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy should be developed and implemented to raise awareness of Dai and the benefits of using a decentralized stablecoin, as well as other Endgame Products. This should include targeted campaigns, partnerships with key industry players, and educational resources for new users. Ecosystem development: The Maker ecosystem should be continuously expanded and improved, with the new Endgame products, services, and applications being developed and integrated into the ecosystem. This should include the development of new use cases for Dai, EtherDAI, and MetaDAO tokens as well as the creation of new tools and resources to support ecosystem growth. Community building: The Maker community should be nurtured and grown, with events, meetups, and other initiatives being organized to bring together users and developers. This will help to foster a sense of community and increase user engagement, which is crucial for long-term ecosystem growth. Incentives for adoption: Incentives should be created to encourage new users to adopt Dai, EtherDAI, and subDAO tokens, with rewards for using such. These incentives should be regularly reviewed by the Advisory Councils and updated to ensure that they remain effective in driving adoption. Integration with other blockchain protocols: The Endgame Ecosystem should be integrated with cross-chains and ecosystems to increase its reach and accessibility. This could include partnerships with other projects, the development of cross-chain incentives, and the creation of decentralized applications that can be used with Dai and Endgame Products (Perhaps).  1.1 User Acquisition and Onboarding This section outlines the processes and incentives to attract new users to MakerDAO and the Endgame Ecosystem, as well as the steps necessary to onboard them effectively. This includes marketing campaigns, referral programs, educational materials and community building initiatives. The goal of the User acquisition and onboarding Growth Scope Framework is to make it as easy as possible for new users to understand the value proposition of Maker, the Dai stablecoin, EtherDAI, SubDAO Tokens and the other products and services offered by the Maker ecosystem. This includes clear and concise explanations of the benefits of holding Dai, the various use cases for Dai, and how users can participate  in the Maker governance process with their MKR and subDAO tokens via the EGFs   1.1.2 To achieve this goal, the User Acquisition and Onboarding scope framework outlines several key strategies, including:   Developing an intuitive Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) that is easy to use, even for those with limited technical experience. This includes clear and concise explanations of how to use the various products and services offered by Maker and the Endgame Ecosystem, as well as a user-friendly design that makes it easy to navigate the interface.   Providing educational resources: The Maker ecosystem must provide a range of educational resources to help new users understand the value proposition of The Maker Constitution and the other products and services offered by Maker and the Endgame Ecosystem. As an example, this can include tutorials, videos, and articles that explain the benefits of holding Dai, the various use cases for Dai, and how to participate in the Maker governance process.   Creating a supportive community: The Endgame Ecosystem must create a supportive community that is welcoming to new users. This includes providing forums and social media channels that are required by the SubDAO Community communication infrastructure where users can ask questions, share their experiences, and connect with other members of the community.   Offering incentives for early adopters: The Maker ecosystem must offer incentives for early adopters to help encourage user acquisition and onboarding.   1.2 Community Building This section outlines the initiatives to grow the MakerDAO community, including events, meetups, hackathons and other initiatives to bring together MakerDAO participants and foster a sense of community. Community Building is a key component of the MakerDAO ecosystem and is responsible for defining and implementing strategies for building and nurturing strong, vibrant, and engaged communities around MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan and its products. The Growth Scope Framework is focused on creating a positive and supportive environment for users, encouraging community members to participate in subDAO governance and decision-making processes, and fostering collaboration and innovation within the ecosystem.   1.2.1 Encourage community involvement: By creating opportunities for community members to participate in governance and decision-making processes, the Growth Scope Framework aims to increase the level of community involvement and engagement in the MakerDAO ecosystem.   1.2.2 Foster collaboration: The Growth Scope Framework seeks to create a collaborative environment that encourages members of the community to work together to achieve shared goals and drive innovation within the ecosystem.   1.2.3 Promote positive culture: The Growth Scope Framework is designed to promote a positive and supportive culture within the MakerDAO community, where members feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute to the ecosystem.   1.2.4 Build trust: The Growth Scope Framework is focused on building trust within the community by promoting transparency, honesty, and fairness in all interactions and decision-making processes.   1.2.5 Encourage education and learning: The Growth Scope Framework is designed to promote education and learning within the MakerDAO community, with a focus on helping community members understand the underlying technology and governance processes.   1.3 Ecosystem Expansion This section outlines the initiatives to expand the reach of MakerDAO and the Endgame Plan, including partnerships with other projects and organizations, integrations with existing platforms and the development of new products and services. This may include exploring new use cases for the Dai stablecoin, developing partnerships with other organizations and projects in the blockchain and DeFi space, and exploring new geographic markets. The focus of the Growth scope framework is to continuously drive growth and adoption of the Maker ecosystem, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the DeFi space and continues to provide value to its users and partners. 1.4 Incentive Programs This section outlines the incentives for users to participate in the growth of MakerDAO, including rewards for referrals, contributions to the Endgame ecosystem, and other initiatives to encourage active participation. Incentive programs can come in many forms, including referral programs, rewards for participating in subDAO governance activities, and rewards for contributing to the Endgame ecosystem development. These programs play a crucial role in creating a virtuous cycle of growth, as they encourage users to engage with the protocol and create a positive feedback loop of increased usage and community building. To be effective, incentive programs should be well-designed, transparent, and aligned with the long-term goals of The Maker Constitution. They should also be regularly evaluated by the Active Responsible Facilitator and adjusted as needed to ensure they continue to drive growth and meet the evolving needs of the ecosystem. 1.5 Metrics and Reporting This section outlines the metrics and reporting mechanisms used to track the progress and success of the growth initiatives, including regular reports on user acquisition, community growth, ecosystem expansion and the effectiveness of incentive programs. This section outlines the metrics that will be used to measure and track growth, as well as the methods and tools that will be used to collect, process, and analyze this data. The metrics will cover a wide range of factors, including user acquisition, user engagement, user retention, and user satisfaction. In addition to measuring and reporting on growth-related metrics, this section will also outline the procedures for regularly reviewing and updating these metrics by the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council in order to ensure that they remain relevant and accurate over time. This may involve incorporating feedback from users and other stakeholders, as well as continuously refining the methods and tools used to collect, process, and analyze the data.   1.5.1 User Acquisition: Track the number of new users who join the MakerDAO and subDAO ecosystem, the conversion rate from sign-up to active use, and the sources of user acquisition (e.g. referrals, marketing campaigns, etc.).  1.5.2 Community Building: Measure the growth of the MakerDAO  and subDAO communities by tracking the number of members, the level of engagement (e.g. posts, comments, etc.), and the sentiment of the community (e.g. positive, neutral, negative).  1.5.3 Ecosystem Expansion: Track the number of new partnerships and integrations with other decentralized protocols and platforms, as well as the volume of transactions on the subDAO platforms.  1.5.4 Incentive Programs: Measure the effectiveness of incentive programs by tracking the number of participants, the volume of rewards distributed, and the impact on user acquisition and engagement.  1.5.5 Metrics and Reporting: Implement robust reporting and on-chain data tracking systems to measure the progress and impact of growth initiatives, including real-time dashboards and regular performance reports.  1.5.b1 Tools for Metrics and Reporting (suggestions)   1.5.6 Analytics platforms: Tools such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Heap can help track and analyze website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates.  1.5.7 Data visualization tools: Tools such as Tableau, PowerBI, and Looker can help to visualize and make sense of complex data sets.  1.5.8 Surveys and customer feedback tools: Tools such as SurveyMonkey, Typeform, and Intercom can be used to gather customer feedback and opinions, and help to identify areas for improvement.  1.5.9 Social media analytics tools: Tools such as Hootsuite, Sprout Social, and Buffer can help to track and analyze social media performance, including engagement rates, reach, and sentiment.  1.5.10 testing tools: Tools such as Optimizely, VWO, and Google Optimize can be used to test and optimize different elements of a website or product to improve performance and user experience.  1.5.11Custom dashboards: Custom dashboards can be built to track specific metric and to display the data in a way that is relevant and meaningful to the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council and Responsible Facilitators.  1.5.c1 Procedures for Metrics and Reporting (suggestions)   1.5.12 Establish clear goals: Before starting the review process, it is important to establish clear growth goals and objectives. This will help to determine which metrics are most relevant and important to track.  1.5.13 Regular tracking: Metrics  should be tracked regularly, such as on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. This allows for a regular and consistent assessment of growth performance.  1.5.14 Data collection and analysis: Accurate and comprehensive data collection is crucial to the review process. Data should be collected from a variety of sources, such as website analytics, community feedback, and market research. The data should then be analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.  1.5.15 Cross-functional collaboration: The review process should involve cross-functional collaboration between the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council, Responsible Facilitators, Ecosystem Actors, and should include marketing, product, and customer service. This can help to provide a comprehensive view of growth performance and identify areas for improvement.  1.5.16 Continuous improvement: The review process should not be a one-time event but should be an ongoing effort. Based on the results of the review, actionable insights should be identified and used to inform continuous improvement efforts.  1.5.17 Communication of results: The results of the review process should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, such as CVCs and the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council to ensure that everyone is aware of the growth performance and areas for improvement.  These metrics are just a starting point, and the specific metrics used to measure growth will depend on the specific goals and initiatives of MakerDAO and the Endgame Plan. It is important for both the Growth Scope Framework Advisory Council and Responsible Facilitators to regularly review and refine these metrics to ensure that they accurately capture the impact of growth initiatives and provide actionable insights for driving further growth. Note: Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC is a proponent of Network Effects and the actual scope framework for Growth may differ depending on the specific needs and goals of MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame Plan. ",

It is simple and seems to include high-level initiatives. I\u2019d like to highlight #4 and #5 within your comment. Partnership roles are paramount in growing the DAO and its products. By building relationships and working with other DAOs, it creates a more cohesive ecosystem and injects new users (and liquidity) into Maker. This valuable tailwind seemed to be lost after the depreciation of the Maker Foundation.  For \u201cCommunity Building\u201d - is this where responsibilities such as DAIvinity fall under? This sort of event marketing is useful - but when & where they are planned must be strategic - reevaluating which demographics are underserved, and ensuring that expenses don\u2019t grow beyond control.  As a data provider who fosters analytics, we believe deeply in the power of BI (business intelligence) to grow and inform organizations. This is important for the DAOs steps. What seems complicated is the mix of data types - you need on-chain, off-chain, etc. Plus where do you put this to add more accountability and participation from the community? As we\u2019ve started to outline in MIP13 - reporting is best to become a standard in the deals we do and the products we support. To ease the burden on Growth (as this scope is large), let\u2019s enforce this.  Just a few thoughts from what we\u2019re seeing and have read above! Thanks, both for shaping this, and excited to contribute more in the future. ",
