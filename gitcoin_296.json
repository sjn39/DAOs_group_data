Governmentality can be understood as:  Governmentality may also be understood as:  Peter Miller, Nikolas Rose, and Mitchell Dean among other scholars have elaborated on the notion of governmentality.       The concept of \u201cgoverning technology\u201d was proposed by Michel Foucault and is understood as the art of government or governmental rationality.  reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing Foucault, M. (2008), The birth of biopolitics. Lectures at the College de France, 1978-79. Palgrave MacMillan  Pareto-optimal executive branch.  The \u2018government\u2019 also signifies problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for the children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc. In his lecture titled Governmentality  We find this in modern times as well, Bruce Schneier, a leading expert in the field of information security, has been using the term \u201cPublic-Interest Technology\u201d a lot since around 2019. The \u201cmyth\u201d that code is the answer and that technology is politically neutral was widespread, especially in Silicon Valley, and there was a strong aversion to getting involved in politics, but at the beginning of the Obama administration in the US, the manifesto \u201cGovernment as a Platform\u201d was put forth, and later Tim In September 2009, Jennifer Palka founded Code for America, a non-profit organization that sends IT engineers to local governments across the United States. Pol.is, a discussion platform for scaling deliberations that has been adopted in Taiwan. kleros, a decentralized court on Ethereum Quadratic Funding, which is used by Gitcoin to distribute grants to digital public goods (OSS) to prevent initial cost problems for public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. We are currently working on DeCartography, a social diversity protocol to realize a \u201cPlurality World\u201d. DeCartography is one of the computational oracles that provide \u201cmultidimensional social diversity\u201d between wallet addresses based on on-chain activity on Ethereum.   Developers using this oracle can use GraphQL to obtain the multidimensional relationship values between a given wallet address and other wallet addresses or groups (which are lists of wallet addresses).   The data used to generate the social graph is determined by the crowdworker. Crowdworkers are rewarded by solving commonsense problems displayed on the platform.   The goal is to collect ratings subjectively from each crowdworker and use the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d to provide a social graph that is as close to objective as possible.   Proof-of-work, one of the consensus algorithms employed in Bitcoin, etc., in which a large number of nodes allocate a specific cost to become validators to provide a specific function, is a representation (report, vote) based on the premise of 1Person, 1ID \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic common sense\u201d represented by 1Person, 1ID as the node of each validator? That is where the experiment begins. Existing distributed oracles on Ethereum, such as Augur and Chainlink\" distribute validators based on tokens, but what if we incorporate Meta-Decentralized, Meta-diversity (a concept I created) indicators in the distribution of the validators? I think that would eliminate cases like Chainlink Whale \u2018Oldwhite\u2019 Used More Than 150 Wallets to Avoid Staking Limits.   coindesk.com \u2013 12 Dec 22    Chainlink Whale \u2018Oldwhite\u2019 Used More Than 150 Wallets to Avoid Staking Limits The crypto wallet labeled \u201cOldwhite\u201d on OpenSea is connected to over 1 million staked LINK tokens, blockchain data shows, even though Chainlink officials tried to get \"greater inclusion\" from a broad base of participants by limiting each wallet to...      For example, if the people furthest away from the \u201cSocial Distance\u201d reported the same answers as validators, it would pretty much avoid collusion and filter bubbles in the democratic process. Adapting this to Quadratic Funding, which inherently has the vulnerability of collusion, one could say that \u201c50 actually independent thinkers are worth more than 1000 NPCs who all consume the same media and vote the same way\u201d can be realized. As a precedent, there is also a precedent in other areas, such as TruthCoin\" which creates an oracle based on peer prediction methods in the Bitcoin sidechain.  proof of (human) work DeCartography itself can also use the data, although it is self-referential. Specifically, DeCartography\u2019s consensus algorithm itself is inherently at risk of 51% attack, but DeCartography, a Social Divercity Oralce, can use its own data to diversify verifiers. ",
