The only thing that I would add are a few items to ward off the obvious criticisms. 1 - I think that testnet validators should be included here as best is possible. We don\u2019t want the aesthetic that airdrops are only going to folks who already have at least 32 ETH. 2 - Exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance) and semi-centralized stake-as-a-service providers (e.g. Lido Finance) should be removed from consideration here. I think that it would be easy to filter depositing addresses (e.g. see pools.invis.cloud for a list of staking pools) ",

In my opinion this should target solo stakers only, those providing and maintaining the resources backing the deposit @smartcontracts brought up an interesting concept of rewarding minority clients, I\u2019m not sure how to match clients to address, if possible, maybe a bonus for using a non-majority client? High barrier to entry : Majority of Ethereum validators are early supporters of the ecosystem who have benefited from capital appreciation for that early support and risk. Rocketpool does reduce the barrier to almost half to join the beacon chain and validate. But maybe we should consider Gnosis chain validators, an Ethereum aligned sidechain with the same codebase and much lower staking requirement to solo validate 1GNO. ",

Surely encouraging people to do this fits precisely with how the airdrop and Ethereum\u2019s Phoenix are supposed to work. What better public good to incentivize for the ecosystem than getting more people to stake themselves (whether with a minipool or solo staking). With that in mind maybe this would be better for an airdrop nearer to when withdrawals are enabled for validators on the Beacon Chain, with the plan to issue some rewards on the same basis in the future. That way people who are currently using CEXs/Lido to stake would see home stakers be rewarded and be able to withdraw their funds from centralized services, set up their own validator and expect a future airdrop for doing so as a way to overcome the friction of effort it entails. EDIT - \u2026 but I don\u2019t have any idea how many people with >16 or greater than >32 ether use centralized services and would therefore be targets for this. ",

These users are securing the chain just as much as the solo stakers. We should probably be aiming for drops that are inclusionary rather than exclusionary when the terms are about helping out.

An example that might illustrate my point is the difference between running a RocketPool minipool (which needs 16 ether) vs holding 16 ether worth of rETH. With the former your ether is committed long term to the security of the network. You cannot unstake and there is not even a date set when this will be possible. Your stake is a demonstration of long term alignment to Ethereum. On the other hand, just holding rETH isn\u2019t a long term commitment. At any time I can swap it for something else, if another chain looks like it might grow faster than Ethereum I can exchange my rETH today for a different token, I\u2019m not tied to Ethereum in the same way. I do appreciate the desire to be inclusionary, but in my opinion if the goal is to encourage certain behaviors that provide the largest benefit then by being less specific with rewards the effect is diluted. What do you see as the advantage of airdropping to staking pool users? I think that\u2019s maybe what I\u2019m not understanding. [Edit - spelling] ",

The reasoning behind rewarding pool stakers is that they are still helping to secure the network. They have committed less resources, but nonetheless they are participating in staking, just in a less full-blown way. So they should be rewarded, but not nearly as much as a solo staker. More philosophically, I think it\u2019s good we distribute in as inclusionary and wide a way as possible because it spreads the token around more, especially to users who may have less ETH or be less technically-savvy, which is really what most solo stakers are, people with less ETH and know-how, who nonetheless want to be involved in staking.

It wouldnt even take any extra distribution, just a positive reallocation. Idk how many validators will truly participate in OP, or if its a good idea to keep dishing out governance tokens to gitcoin, validators, users of other main chains, and generally non users of their product\u2026 but I suppose very few airdrops have tried. It could work maybe, although it is gambling somewhat. I mean really you ideally reward real current users and incentivize them to stick around with the vast majority of stake. Validators do play a significant role in securing eth, which secures op as well. Thats why redistributing from sybil farmers makes sense, as it is certainly better allocated to anyone remotely related to OP than the guy basically attacking your governance and token (Mr. Sybil). Massive amounts of OP has been sybil farmed, even a small portion of these would probably result in a larger drop to validators than your average OP user. This should probably be reassesed and reperportioned more toward your current community and users with smaller amounts going to non users. Otherwise you are kind of incentivizing people not to use your product. Efficiency! ",

List of Addresses that Deposited the Ethereum Beacon Chain Contract  - GitHub - GLCNI/ETH-Validators-List: List of Addresses that Deposited the Ethereum Beacon Chain Contract      glad to see discussion here, my intention is to target solo stakers (those running validators), stETH/rETH or similar holders, have liquidity and are not providing the same useful service to the network that node operators do, which is the physical infrastructure layer of Ethereum, without them it would not exist. Also much more difficult to implement, stETH is liquid, it\u2019s on exchanges and Liquidity pools, holders can transfer and there\u2019s multiple ways to obtain these tokens. Where validators have simply deposited into a contract and would be eligible. Another side effect This has the potential to encourage decentralisation of ETH staking, by introducing external incentives to run validators (even with RPL or obol/SSV ) more unique stakers backing nodes to secure the network, and reducing LIDOs increasing (and concerning) share of Ethereum staking. Other L2 networks, should think about this too, especially when decentralising the node set (sequencers), it will be important that distribution includes node runners, not just farmers. ",

In particular, solostaker identified that he holds eth. I believe that those who can take out 32ETH and run beaconnode and validator by themselves are able to judge that they will pay the opportunity cost of investing in a bull market. And they took a lot of risks, especially the genesis validators. At that time, they took a lot of unknown risks and the whole chain failed.So I think this behavior should be encouraged no matter whether they are OptimismDao users or not, and it is beneficial to attract them to join optimismdao. In addition, we suggest that we should consider attracting them to accept OP as a tip in the future and give priority to providing L1 attestation for optimsim. ",

As a genuine L2 (not sidechain) Optimism is an extension of ETH, validators are integral to the network and should have a say in Layer 2. Most likely to run full nodes on L2 and sequencers when available. Reality is most users do not run nodes and have no interest in doing so. If you aren\u2019t in this list, because you don\u2019t have enough ETH I strongly encourage you to support this, there are solutions around the corner to run \u2018shared\u2019 validators with as little as 4 ETH, eg:OBOL network and SSV. It is essential for the long-term success of Ethereum we do not allow the chain to be captured and monopolised by a few entities, external incentives such as this will have positive effect on decentralisation. In time the ROI of being a validator could outweigh minting liquid staking derivatives, as other layer 2s/projects will likely include validators in future distributions. ",

Allnodes could be classified as semi-custodial, they\u2019re not in control my private key, but they do have a copy of my validator key. It is possible to shut off the linode server that is rented through Allnodes and move the validator to one\u2019s own home server or another vps if a person desires. I do have custody of both my private key and validator keys. Allnodes simplifies the process to a fault in this case, and that might be what the issue is, as they suggest people use the abyss finance smart contract to deposit to the beaconchain contract address,  as it is more user friendly. (Allnodes does support depositing to the beaconchain contract directly though.) This is my validators ETH 1 address. (I\u2019m fine disclosing all this information, especially if it helps the community at large.) (Link had to be broken up in order to post all 3 links) https:// etherscan .io/address/0x2ecB2e40762EDf33ff20EE9A37C5A8F6327aAe31 This is the deposit transaction that interfaced with the abyss finance contract and the beaconchain contract for my validators public key.

As far as I can tell all the abyss finance contract does is take the ETH sent to it and immediately deposit it for a person onto the beaconchain in the same transaction. Personally I feel that staking on an allnodes vps fits the ethos to target solo validators as anyone using an allnodes vps can change servers at any time and use their validator keys elsewhere.
