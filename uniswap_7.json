Also, on Twitter, there are only 5 posts since the beginning of the year (?!) And I can\u2019t even find an official Uniswap account on Instagram \u2026 A good visibility could help us to grow the UNI holders number, so why hiding ? A lot of crypto competitors use the airdrop in return of the \u201cfollow official account on twitter\u201d for exemple. In short, to be seen more could help the UNI community. Have all a nice weekend ! Ben. ",

I was wondering if any of the Uniswap team would be interested in reading over the paper and giving input. We are on rough draft v2 now and looking for comments for editing or improving the current draft of the document! Who should I contact to see if interested in giving it a review before we publish it to our newsletter? ",
