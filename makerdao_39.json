Its pretty far along, but once that is agreed on an interested party can start the application for OMG, which would take some time since risk, legal and technical analysis takes alot of work, not to mention the bureaucracy which would take minimum 2-3 months I think. Personally I\u2019d guess onbaording OMG will take at least 9 months maybe longer probably not shorter (depending if the analysis part is already underway and if the community is interested) ",
