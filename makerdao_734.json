The reward was specified at 100,000 DAI \u201cif the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote.\u201d This part is clear. \u201cAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 50,000.\u201d The words no more than suggest that an inequality is intended. That is, bounty <= $50k instead of bounty = $50k. We omit the words \u201cno more than\u201d to obtain the intended reward mechanics.
