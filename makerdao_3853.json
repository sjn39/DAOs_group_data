I arrived at the number (70k) because at todays prices it would allow the DAO to pay roughly 3% on the current Dai supply. To be clear, this Dai would be paid to Vault users that mint Dai, not on Dai itself. It would increase our market share (by effectively causing the USDC in Maker to be redeemed or increasing the total amount of Dai generated) and remove the existential risk/PR issues. The downside, of course, is that (a) it may not work as intended and (b) it dilutes MKR holders. It also wouldn\u2019t permanently solve the problem, it would just buy us more time to do something like refinancing into Real World Assets at scale. We\u2019d also still likely have some USDC in the system given the current growth rate of Dai demand, but it would hopefully be an inconsequential amount. I\u2019m bringing this up now because there\u2019s been a lot of creative solutions thrown around to \u201cquickly\u201d achieve this goal, and while they\u2019re interesting and should potentially be pursued in parallel, I think we should rule out the simplest method first if we\u2019re going to devote resources to this.    Would you spend 70,000 MKR to (hopefully) get rid of the USDC?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

I suspect there\u2019s some novelty and dry powder on the sidelines that would enter at much smaller incentive rates, say 0.5%, which would be paid for out of the stability fees we\u2019re charging. It would result in a lower return for MKR holders for sure, but I wouldn\u2019t frame it as MKR lost any more than I\u2019d frame reducing rates as MKR lost. It\u2019s just where the market is at. I think of this as the missing \u201cDai Generation Rate\u201d that would complement the \u201cDai Savings Rate\u201d at the other side of the peg. Anyways, It\u2019s not necessary to go entirely out of pocket to provide some incentive for vaultholders so I don\u2019t really agree with the way that this is worded. If MKR holders are willing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to maintain the Dai peg, I don\u2019t see how vaultholder incentives as a solution are any more extreme than taking on billions in regulated stablecoins.

We won\u2019t last long if we are just accumulating usdc and dai. Also the last big up was triggered by curve and compound. If no one is doing anything it is not going to bring more people into defi and dai supply won\u2019t increase. Most importantly, when a dollar is bringing into Ethereum it rarely leaves therefore if more people are coming we are also building our future. Think about Ford.
