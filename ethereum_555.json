Status uses it in production, as does Bloom for something entirely different, as do some other interesting and technically advanced projects. I would like to see that removed from the agenda so the focus is on more useful topics like \u201cwhat we expect from the whisper specification\u201d. That is,  Is whisper intended really just for DApps, as Gav and Parity have always said, or should/can we use it for broader communications? If it is just for DApps, is it not already sufficient? If we can\u2019t use it for broader comms, then do we need another spec (i.e. what is starting to be discussed between Status, the W3F and others) for secure person-to-person messaging and, if so, What should the properties of this new spec ideally be such that it meets our needs as an ecosystem/community?  I have already suggested we use the #whisper topic to discuss this, but got told off for doing so. I still maintain that actually using the protocol is the best way to:  Ask better questions. Understand what the current capabilities really are so as to drive informed dicussion about further development.  ",
