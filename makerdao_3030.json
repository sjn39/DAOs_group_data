At Secret Network we are building a privacy preserving smart contracting platform and bringing privacy to Ethereum assets through the bridge we built between Ethereum and Secret Network. The bridge is expected to go on mainnet on December 14, 2020. Adding MKR (and DAI) to the bridge, will enable holders to create wrapped MKR/DAI with privacy, which we would call secretMKR or secretDAI. This is similar to an ERC20 on our network, yet since contracts are encrypted tokens issued with contracts are privacy tokens. secretTokens are already live on Secret Network Holders of secretMKR can:  privately transact (like zCash) secretMKR on Secret Network redeem secretMKR to a new ETH address to achieve transactional privacy on ETH, which is similar to Tornado Cash (at ~30% of Tornado\u2019s cost) participate in a front-running resistant AMM, which is expected to go live in early 2021  We are here to get feedback on whether this is interesting for the Maker community and contribute. We are big fans of what you are building. If there\u2019s any interest, we\u2019d be happy to go ahead with this technical integration that will bring privacy to MKR and DAI. Would really appreciate thoughts and comments! cc @vamsi ",

Then the multisig committee confirm the TX on ETH and mint secretMKR for Alice on Secret Network. When Alice wants to redeem back her MKR, she burns MKR, paying gas on Secret Network (in SCRT). Say Alice is redeeming 10 secretMKR, she\u2019ll actually get 9.99x MKR on Ethereum. The fee is used to cover the gas cost of the multisig operators. The fee is determined based on ETH gas prices.

Contracting language / smart contract development: Aztec uses Noir, which is a new language to write custom ZK circuits. In Secret Network secret contracts are written in Rust, which is a more established language with a community. I haven\u2019t looked into Noir in detail but I do believe it would be harder to build applications on Aztec than it\u2019s on Secret Network   Interoperability: Aztec uses ZK roll ups to get data back to ETH and do state changes. Secret Network currently uses a 3-5 multisig bridge (including validators like Figment, Staked, B-Harvest) to move assets. In the future, when Peggy (Cosmos - ETH Bridge) is functional and battle-tested, SN will be using Peggy   I hope this helps and I should also note that I am not an expert on Aztec, I hope I haven\u2019t misrepresented anything ",

                    "content": "hahah, funny but not really accurate  ZKP vs. TEE is an approach to privacy. I take renBTC vs. wBTC is a comment on decentralization. SN is a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain with Tendermint consensus, there are 50 validators. Therefore even if you believe that TEEs are flawed because of theoretical attacks that have not been achieved in production setting (Signal uses TEEs to be precise), there\u2019s network wide consensus and you\u2019d need 2/3 of the validators to be corrupted to lose correctness guarantees. The multisig bridge that we\u2019ve built is more similar to renBTC, which is a simple Shamir secret sharing. If you are curious to see a review of their repo take a look here. My goal being here is to see whether the MKR community cares for privacy for MKR. I don\u2019t want to talk about a project in a place where they probably are not present. ",
