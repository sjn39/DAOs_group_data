I updated my Funding Experiments page on the EthWiki. It is editable by anyone, but it right now mainly is just me / my point of view. Meaning: please do edit / annotate / add links & resources etc \u2013 and we can use this thread more for discussion. I think the Ethereum Stack is still the best, most adopted, most shipping blockchain stack there is. And I wish the ecosystem could improve more and more quickly. This mainly requires an investment of dedicated people time, and to get those dedicated people they\u2019re going to have to get funded to work on various aspects full time. Or not, and things will improve more slowly or not at all. ",
