Thank you for joining episode #05 of Focus On. I am Retro, a contributor with the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU. I am co-hosting this call with SES\u2019 facilitator Juan. Today we are joined by the Centrifuge team for an open AMA discussion. The Centrifuge team has prepared an update for the Maker community in which they will share some news on growth within their project, their updated legal structure for US assets, and how NFTs enable a transparent way for decentralizing Real World Assets in DeFi. Please drop any questions into the chat bar. Our guests will answer questions during a break-in-the-action or at the end of the prepared presentation during the Q&A.

                    "content": "We at Centrifuge had a great time hosting the AMA last Wednesday, and wanted to share some key interactions from the session in case you missed it or want a refresh. We loved the idea sharing, and look forward to continued engagement and discussion with the Maker community. Q: What are your thoughts on Centrifuge being open source? A (Centrifuge): Centrifuge code is 100% open source and that the CFG chain is a public proof-of-stake chain. and that\u2019s exactly the idea. There are two things we would like to achieve:  Automate what intermediaries do now Make it transparent and traceable through blockchain, through our protocol  Q: How would the underlying collateral be repaid? A (Centrifuge): The repayments of the underlying collateral would be assigned to the SPV, and the SPV would direct these to the collection account. So that\u2019s all happening off chain. Then there will then be a transfer mechanism, still yet to be worked out, in order to convert the fiat cash into USDC and USDC into Dai that would be distributable to the token holders. So the collection account itself is not on chain. The collection account is a very real world, traditional fiat account with a transfer and translation mechanism, still to be worked out depending on the technological capabilities of the trustee. Q: Would outside counsel review the legal documents? A (Centrifuge): Absolutely, without any doubt. We\u2019ve already sent a draft of the indenture over to @christiancdpetersen and we certainly expect that outside counsel will be used. We\u2019ve used our outside counsel, Manatt, to help develop the documents. And absolutely, we expect Maker to have their outside counsel look at it, and we\u2019re happy to have any calls to discuss with them, ourselves and also with our counsel if necessary. Q: Who are the beneficiaries of the trust? A (Centrifuge): The token holders are the beneficiaries of the trust. So the indenture is worked out so that the trustee acts on behalf of the token holders. Obviously DROP and TIN will have different rights vis-a-vis the issuer. But the trustee itself will be acting on behalf of all the token holders. That\u2019s the way it normally would work in traditional markets with a bond issuance. Q: What would be the collection account instructions? A (Centrifuge): It\u2019s really going to be very deal specific. What are the assets that we\u2019re talking about? Is it a mortgage? Is it a trade receivable? We\u2019ll probably have to do it in different ways depending on the types of real world assets that are going to be involved, where the issuers are located and what currency the receivables might be in. So there\u2019ll be a number of different elements to that which we can\u2019t really do on a abstract, pro forma basis. We\u2019re looking at the best ways out there but the collection account is designed to ensure that there is as little human intervention as possible and minimize errors where money can get lost. The main purpose of the collection account is really that the third party trustee is obliged to follow the interest of the token holders. So the investors control the cash flow, not the asset originators or someone who is close to the originator to minimize the chances of funds being used for different purposes, etc. All the cash drawn from the protocol basically goes to the borrowers and from the borrowers back to the protocol, controlled by the trustee and collection account. Asset originators will still be able to pay for service fees, etc., but not use the money for something else. Q: When will current Centrifuge pools convert to the new legal structure? A (Centrifuge): We want to make sure that the new structure is fully agreed upon before we get to the point of converting existing SPV structures. We certainly expect and intend to have current Centrifuge pools convert to the new legal structure. But that\u2019s a second step; we need to finish the first step first, and want to make sure that the Maker community and the Core Unit is happy with the documentation, and we have trustees that would be able to act on behalf of issuers. So we have a couple of different things to work on between now and next few weeks. But we do expect sometime in the near future, to be able to start working on the conversion of the existing SPV structures. Q: How would the beneficiaries of the trust be KYC-ed? A (Centrifuge): The KYC is an interesting point. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to discuss with the potential trustees. We think that the beneficiary should be able to pass through the KYC because we will have permissioned them with our KYC in advance anyway, and that\u2019s already going to give the trustees probably everything they need. Now, if there\u2019s a gap on the KYC side between what Securitize is doing for us now, and what the trustees think they might need in the future, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to address. We\u2019ll have to maybe work with Securitize to develop a KYC that the trustees feel comfortable with, but it is absolutely key that we have to make sure that there is an alignment for the KYC processes between what the trustee would need and what we do today with Securitize. A (Maker): So, part of what we\u2019re trying to solve was that in the previous structure, there was a subscription agreement but Maker never signed anything because Maker didn\u2019t have an entity and there was no legal entity in which to sign. Part of what we are trying to solve is for somebody or something having rights with respect to the DROP tokens, in addition to just putting them in the vault. The idea was to have a Cayman foundation or a Cayman trust hold the signatory to the subscription agreements for the DROP tokens. That entity would then arguably be subject to the KYC. So the trustee would, in theory, be looking to that Cayman Island entity much like it probably did in the 6S case, look to the Cayman Charitable Trust and understand who is or what is at the Cayman Island entity. So I think that\u2019s where the KYC would be handled. It\u2019s a good question: it still needs to be tested, it\u2019s only been tested on 6S. But that\u2019s the principle: that there is a legal entity in the Cayman Islands that can be KYC-ed because that legal entity will have directors and, like in a Cayman foundation, would have a supervisor who equates for KYC purposes as a controlling person. A (Centrifuge): We think that the trustees will expect that the end beneficiaries will also need to be KYC-ed, or at least checked for financial crimes, compliance and sanctions. If they\u2019re distributing cash based on the liquidation of underlying assets, in case of an event of default, they\u2019re going to look at the end beneficiaries and the end users of any kind of cash distribution, whether that\u2019s converted into Dai and distributed to the token holders. We think they\u2019ll still need to make sure that any cash is not going to sanctioned individuals, people on the SDN list, probably for other purposes as well. Q: What is the timing that you think will be needed to finalize the legal structure? A: It\u2019s a good question, and we should thank @eumenes and @christiancdpetersen, for all the hard work that they did. The MIP6 methodology that they prepared and posted to the forum was instrumental in all of our thinking in terms of getting these documentation in place. They\u2019ve been incredibly helpful and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without their input and their assistance. There is more work going forward. We\u2019ve got a draft of the indenture. Obviously, outside counsel needs to look at it; it needs to get reviewed. We can hopefully have that finalized in the next two to three weeks. Once that\u2019s done, we think other things will be much more straightforward, and the only thing that we have a dependency on is the potential trustee. We\u2019ve had a couple of calls with potential trustees with the traditional kind of trust banks that you would see in the traditional markets. We didn\u2019t find any red flags, or that they think that this is going to be impossible. But it\u2019s going to take some effort to educate them about exactly what we\u2019re doing and what the DeFi world looks like, what Maker is like, so that is a dependency on external third parties which is hard to predict in terms of timing. Q: When will more Centrifuge projects apply? A (Centrifuge): We know it\u2019s been a while since we submitted an MIP6. We are trying to be really cognizant about protecting the DAO and in parallel we are working on legal structure and other things with the RWF Core Unit. It\u2019s really about making sure that the DAO is comfortable with the legal structure and the protections that go along with it. Many discussions around the arranger and the new RWF structure and requirements are still evolving. Legal structure is one thing but also the quality of assets is important. That is exactly the kind of pool which is waiting to be onboarded: single lender, high quality business; it\u2019s exactly aligned. Q: Could Maker use Centrifuge rails to tokenize and onboard as collateral, securities that are traded in the open market (to diversify for USDC exposure) or are you focused on a DROP/TIN construct that is specific for structured lending? A (Centrifuge): How we built Tinlake and how we think about its infrastructure is a set of very modular smart contracts. The two tranches make a lot of sense for a debt issuer where we want to have an issuer to have a lot of equity, meaning like they take the first loss and Maker is senior. This is not necessary in all situations, and you can just have a single token where Maker, for example, takes the whole portfolio. Q: ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) is getting into security tokens and I see the security tokens coming into play in the next 24 months, maybe less. Would Centrifuge move away from that two token DROP/TIN model and perhaps create an OpenSea for security tokens and how that can play well in the sandbox for MakerDao. Just thinking out loud, but I do think that there\u2019s going to be a strong push from institutional players to get their hands on tokenized securities in the next 12 to 24 months. A (Centrifuge): We think that ICE being a regulated exchange is only going to be able to offer that service to licensed broker dealers and they won\u2019t be able to offer directly to the retail markets. So what we would be doing would probably not be directly competing with them as we wouldn\u2019t be able to do something. But you\u2019re right, the institutional players, they certainly will be expecting to or planning to get into these markets as much as they can Q: Do we plan to move any of the legal improvements on chain? A (Centrifuge): We took this old school structure of a credit fund and tried to figure out how to replace it with smart contracts. Without major changes in laws around the world, there remains a need to have some off chain legal entity to complete the picture. But the goal for Tinlake really is and that we think it already does today is there\u2019s on chain representation and the logic of how to distribute funds, how to accrue interest, how to value assets. All of that is on chain and fully transparent. We are pushing as much as we can on chain here and that has huge benefits for investors like Maker, for the asset originators and issuers because they don\u2019t have to worry about fund admin anymore, they can tap into different sources of liquidity like Maker and other investors. And the same goes for the trustee and the collection account. We think that eventually a trustee could directly sign a transaction in Metamask or something similar to that on chain. We\u2019re still a bit far away from that today. but that will change. What this will look like in the future is you can almost think of the trustee as an oracle provider, the collection account as well. Maybe there\u2019ll be auditing firms that are going to be working with Maker to provide third party statements on what\u2019s going on, where the money\u2019s flowing and provide that service as a feed. That\u2019s really the vision because if we just take like a bond portfolio that exists entirely off chain, it can be great collateral for Maker and it can scale really well. But we don\u2019t think that\u2019s the future of where finance should go because the future of finance is DeFi, where you have this transparency, you have trustless blockchains that are used to create these products, and not just used to provide liquidity to off chain products and that\u2019s really where we want to go in the long run. But of course, that\u2019s a big vision that will take time to implement. Q: And what about Centrifuge getting involved with Aave\u2019s ARC and SEBA, the Swiss bank? Is there anything that MakerDao as a community can do, to use a tool like D3M, to help get some liquidity there? What are your thoughts on your partnership with Aave? And also, what can MakerDao do to help scale the entire ecosystem of RWA in your opinion? A (Centrifuge): We think D3M for the real world asset market would be absolutely amazing. And not just for Centrifuge issuers but also for Dai and Maker. If you think of a healthy financial system, in which Maker plays the role of issuing Dai, they want to issue Dai whenever there is demand for more Dai and they want to be able to take it off the market when there isn\u2019t. The Aave protocol can play the counter role right. When users who own Dai want to earn yield, put it into the real world asset market, that means Maker can reduce Dai supply and those users can provide liquidity to these assets. Now when Dai demand changes, for example, then Maker can go in and provide more liquidity to the market. In this way, it creates liquidity for where there isn\u2019t today and it allows for the supply and demand of Dai to balance more naturally. That\u2019s really cool. It will also require a bit of legal work to figure out exactly how we can implement D3M with a trust structure with the legal topics we discussed here but ultimately, we think will work quite well for Maker. A (Maker): I agreed with the question particularly about how we can bring this all on chain. I think you guys have taken a great first step to eventually have as much as possible on chain. I think to the extent that we can bring as much transparency and reduce the costs, that should be the goal and you guys have done a great job. Can we have bank accounts governed by smart contracts system? Then you really don\u2019t need to have a US dollar denominated account governed by smart contracts, right? Because it\u2019s actually just digits anyway, it\u2019s not like there are actual dollar bills that someone has to do anything with. I know it\u2019s not available yet, but ultimately, if you can automate as much of the process as possible, I think that will be the goal. We\u2019ll get there, it\u2019s just not there yet. A (Maker): The vision is for Maker to become the senior lender of last resort across the whole DeFi and potentially also plugging to let other protocols do the heavy lifting and benefit from most of the returns, being junior to us, and also being the most powerful on ramp for institutional investors. If you\u2019re an investor in TradFi and you have billions of dollars of long dated collateral; if you want to enter DeFi, you need to liquidate that, put it in USDC and onramp, which is antiquated. They could use that collateral as a pledge and then we would mint Dai for them on chain and then if they want they can stay on chain and play on chain, which is very powerful because there\u2019s no slippage and no need for liquidation. Now I think what we are stressing to the community is that to do that, we need to be safe and comfortable that the quality is there. That\u2019s why this work that is painful of legal instruction is super powerful, because as you know well, sometimes behind the hype, it\u2019s organizational. With us, there are no real rights or real control of the collateral. I think we have a lot of work in educating the community. People like you guys, structuring yourselves and bootstrapping, bootstrapping with some other counterparties and we will get there. We want to be as programmatic as possible and provide liquidity to real world assets and other DeFi protocols. But being senior to the rest, just having quasi zero returns but expanding the footprint of the Dai in a sustainable way. So hopefully in two to three years time, we\u2019ll get there but now we\u2019re all together trying to bootstrap this. It is very exciting. A (Centrifuge): 100%. It\u2019s cool to hear that from all of you guys who we think have shared similar thoughts like bringing real world assets into Maker to some extent is about stabilizing Dai by making sure it\u2019s backed by diverse and stable collateral. And that should be a mix of all these different assets from crypto native to real real assets across different jurisdictions, different asset classes and so on. But once that part is fixed, we have real world assets and Maker to supply all the Dai that we need. At that point we also need to think about how we make Dai and Maker and DeFi as a whole, the entire infrastructure, now that all these real world assets that are backed by Dai, actually use Dai and exactly that\u2019s where we need to go. We need to do this work to then do things like the D3M integration with Aave or the other steps to bring more and more of that on chain. Q: I thought the presentation was great. And there is progress on the legal front, which is awesome. I was just wondering on the Maker side, especially as a Cayman foundation, trust or any entities, what is the situation? Is everything okay on our side, to be able to hold the DROP tokens. It\u2019s more of a question for @christiandpetersen, who did an excellent job on setting everything up. A (Maker): I think it\u2019s really the same issues we\u2019ve discussed before. We will need a legal entity to sign the subscription agreement for the DROP tokens and can have contractual rights vis-a-vis the trustee. And I think that was one of the fundamental issues that we had in the original structures where the tokens were deposited in the vault which is what we want, but there was kind of a bifurcation between the tokens being deposited in the vault and then there being a subscription agreement that sets forth terms and conditions. Maker didn\u2019t have any ability to enforce those terms and conditions. All it had was tokens in the vault. So it\u2019s really just trying to bridge that. The intention, at least with respect to this particular case, is to keep the Cayman Island entity as simple as possible because what\u2019s unique about the Centrifuge case, is that they\u2019ve actually bifurcated cash flow with legal rights. You\u2019ve got the concept of the token that\u2019s deposited in the vault that is representing the DROP. Yet you then have contractual rights that are needing to be documented on a piece of paper. So as a consequence, you need to have that real world entity to enforce those contractual legal rights. They may be limited in this case, to whatever is provided in the indenture. You will need that legal entity. But the cash is actually then going through the Tinlake protocol. So when I say cash, I\u2019m collapsing fiat to Dai into payment into the Maker vault. That\u2019s all being done separately. So you don\u2019t need, like in the 6S case, a trustee actually holding the cash because that is just coming out of a trust account and then going through the Tinlake protocol, really functioning as the paying agent. In this particular case that is how I viewed it. The trustee initiates the dollar payment into the protocol through an exchange agent and then once Dai goes into the protocol it gets distributed back into the vault. To your point, I think the Cayman Island foundation will have an exceptionally limited role in acting with respect to whatever matters are set forth in the subscription agreement, and the agreement in the indenture trust. Q: Yeah, I just wanted to check if we solved the last piece. That was not a big issue, but I don\u2019t remember exactly. Like the relationship between an executive vote on the Maker side and the trustee in the Cayman Islands. Trustees might not be super willing to act and look at the blockchain everyday. A (Maker): On that, no, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point. And it\u2019ll depend on what the actual indenture says. And @elidco has sent it and we\u2019ll have to see what kind of voting rights and what decision rights the DROP and TIN token holders have and then work our way back up through the chain based on that.
