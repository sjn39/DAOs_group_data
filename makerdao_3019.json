As long as Dai remains above the peg, loan growth should be the number one priority for Maker. As we onboard more types of decentralized collateral as well as untested collateral types like RWA, we encounter different kinds of risks, and we have to subsidize those risks to some degree to ensure Maker remains the preferred borrowing platform during this crypto growth period. I propose a surplus buffer increase cadence, which, if passed, will be bundled with each weekly executive vote. A change or halt to the cadence will need to be passed through the signal process as opposed to the status quo where any increase in the buffer must go through the full governance process. The cadence can be anchored to a percentage of Dai in circulation or a flat increase week over week. This allows us to be prepared for the increase in risk we take on during this rapid growth period as well as prepare us to make large capital spending decisions without the help of the Foundation when we need to.

The level of surplus buffer we need to have really depend on the risk appetite of the Maker Governance. The rest is just on how to optimise fees generation for a specific size of surplus buffer. But, obviously, it\u2019s not easy to model all the correlation and end up with the perfect surplus buffer size for a given balance sheet and a risk appetite. Should we risk MKR dilution once a year, once a decade? What about burning MKR with 50% of the fees and using the rest to increase the surplus buffer? Like with increase the SB of 1M every 2M fees.

With 586MM Dai issued from volatile collateral that means our buffer should be between 11.7 and 23.4 million Dai. Right now our coverage is 0.68%. I suggest we bundle an increase of $250k in the stability buffer each week. In that way we will reach the 2% coverage level in 31 weeks, and roughly $30k of protocol income would still be used for buying MKR. The proportion of of income used to burn MKR would increase as more loans are issued and more stability fee income is collected. Alternately, as you suggested, we can look back at the total fees collected in the previous week, and increase the stability buffer as a percentage of that. We can continue this until we reach the 2% coverage level, at which point we can decide to anchor the surplus buffer to 2% of volatile Dai supply or do something else. ",

I do think though that we need a mechanism where percentage of fees are distributed to accomplish this, rather than constantly having votes to enable and disable MKR burn to increase Surplus. And when risk is growing because of larger Dai supply, the fixed weight assigned to Surplus increases nominal Dai added to it because fees are nominally larger. When risk increases due to some structural risk changes (unrelated to higher Dai supply, related more to collateral risk), you just increased weight for surplus. ",

                    "content": "Thanks Primoz. My opinion is that the level of the surplus buffer should be equal to SURPLUS_FACTOR (systemic risk level) * VOLATILE_DAI_SUPPLY. Anything in excess of that should be used to burn MKR. The cadence can be used to set the level of surplus, while a system like FlapperDistributor can control how that level gets filled. Since FlapperDistributor needs smart contract work, and (IMO) we have to urgently increase surplus, a flat cadence can allow us to begin to consistently increase surplus in a palatable way, since it is automatic and MKR still consistently gets burned. I think the ideal end scenario is an automatic cadence that sets the surplus level by reading VOLATILE_DAI_SUPPLY at the smart contract level, so that governance only needs to vote on SURPLUS_FACTOR. It can be used in combination with FlapperDistributor to fill the buffer up. ",

I an in favour of this idea at aiming to a 2-4% surplus buffer (or even more). Sound good and safe! However it would really be a shame to have 20millions (i.e., 2-4%) sitting there just in case something goes worng, right? It would be better to invest (in a way we consider VERY VERY safe) the surplus buffer money. One interesting example is, e.g., to LP the DAI-MKR pair on Uniswap. Another (perhaps easier) example is just to place the DAI of the surplus in a yEarn Vault (i.e., getting yDAI). ",

It would be better to invest (in a way we consider VERY VERY safe) the surplus buffer money.   Actually you can\u2019t invest the surplus buffer money, because there is no money. As described in my accounting post, the surplus buffer is a liability not an asset. I can see 2 things that are possible to do with a surplus buffer:  switching the liability type from equity to issued DAI, i.e. giving DAI to someone. Most likely for something that increase the immaterial value of Maker (marketing, domain teams, \u2026). Issuing DAI to buy an asset then destroying the asset (which decrease the equity). That what is done when buying and burning MKR.  There is no way that buying an asset (USDC, ETH, a house, whatever) can decrease the surplus buffer (at least initially, ETH price can decrease just after). If you buy a risky asset, you increase risk so you need a bigger surplus buffer. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a bit stubborn the the need of accounting and balance sheets. I know it\u2019s not easy. But if we don\u2019t frame the problem correctly, we can\u2019t solve it. ",

I\u2019ve been looking a bit lately at @Vishesh collateral risk model and have been using it to try and determine the VaR of the whole portfolio. From what i am seeing the DAO needs to set aside something like the next 4 years of revenue (at current levels) just to hedge against the jump risks of it\u2019s loan portfolio. Needless to say i doubt that something people would find palatable. That being the case, the only path forward I really see is to raise revenue. I also agree with the sentiment that optimizing the stability buffer might be a bit of \u201cbike shed\u201d idea. Like i said, what i think the DAO needs to be focusing on atm is how it can get cash flows up and preferably how it can do it without taking on more loan exposure. Raising SFs spreads seems like the obvious choice, but there are likely other revenue opportunities.I wish i could be more helpful on what those might be. I know oracle usage fees have been talked about in the past. Potentially strategic fund investments might also be an option. I guess i just want to say that i think we need to be mindful about how the portfolios risk exposure is trending, but i don\u2019t think the DAO will ever be able to offset those risks via the stability buffer until the protocol\u2019s current cash intake is in a much better state.
