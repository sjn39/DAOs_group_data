This first release is powered by the Token Flow suite of data analytics tools. You can find out more about the API and the Beta Program here: https://api.mcdstate.info/ The release is limited to an API, which may be useful for developers and community members interested in learning more about vaults or running auctions keepers. In Q1 2021, it is planned that the Beta Program will be replaced with a full release which will include a Graphical User Interface and visualizations. Community members are invited to register for the Beta Program and to provide their feedback in the Rocket Chat Channel #tf-vaults-dataset-ext. ",
