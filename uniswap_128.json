                    "content": "On june 10 2021, I sold all my UNI (@ 32 usd) bc of the clear legal troubles that were coming down.  I put it all into SOL (@ 35 usd). You can see this in my post here: Consensus Check - UNI should fund a political defense organization for decentralized finance - #106 by jchervinsky (control + f \u2018solana\u2019 ) Since then my position is up by 5.5x and UNI is down 20% \u2026 the justification for me doing this is that Uniswap Labs is based in NYC, USA \u2190 literally the worst place to be from a regulatory perspective.  So all their VC backing was not able to successfully advise them to at least not be in NYC but also to not be in USA. Additionally, the Defi Education Fund, which is approximately $50 mm in $UNI Tokens which was pushed thru without even a public call - what did it result in? \u2014The infra bill passed, \u2014The SEC has started an inquiry which Jake Chervinsky leader of the DEFI Edu fund does not think is a big deal - LOL! Yes 24/365 protocol that does over $1 billion + in volume per 24h its not a big deal when govt starts an inquiry LOL! \u2014UNI token drop by 20% If this $50 million was put into $SOL token as I advised, it would be worth over $250 million now.  This would be more than enough money for the community to do whatever it wants for a decade. Its important to not blindly follow religion and to also think outside the box. Lawyers are not the foundation of crypto - developers are. I am proposing to manage 10,000 UNI tokens for 1 year.  I will invest them how I think best and will return all funds at the end of 1 year.  I will not take a fee. The community can then decide what to do with the gains. ",

                    "content": "the SEC just made Coinbase stop offering 4% interest, bc they want to protect investors! note that Uniswap Labs biggest name investors, Paradigm and A16Z led massive rounds into Solana $314 million as well as raising $900 million for FTX. Both of these happened appx. in the time between the DeFi education fund saga started and now. Notice how that \u201cinstitutional\u201d money was not put into Uniswap Labs but instead into an offshore project and exchange.  Instead those VCs via their university proxies that they control raided the UNI treasury for $50 million USD. Instead of raiding the UNISWAP treasury all that had to be done was UNISWAP LABS move off shore and never have started in the USA anyway.  This was known since 2017 when they shut down ICO\u2019s etc. and totally destroyed crypto markets. Really mind blowing how anyone thought it was a good idea to found uniswap in new york USA. So now if Coinbase w/ 100+ lawyers can\u2019t do it, the great DeFi Education Fund will be able to do it? LOL The SEC is saying very directly, MOVE OFF SHORE. I propose to give the defi education fund $ to Hayden and his devs to live very comfortably off shore.  This is maniacal.  Feels like we\u2019re in crazy land. ",

So if anyone took me seriously, the Uni community would be up instead of down 80%.  Nice job guys. Notably, I personally outperformed every major crypto fund this cycle on a % basis. Where did Uniswap Labs get all their funding from to hire 50+ people? U are exit liquidity for Hayden and his crew, like for over $1 billion USD.  Hayden is a genius scientist.  Very rarely in history does the scientist lead the operation to generate good return for share holders.  You may say, it was free! No, the teased the fee switch which will likely never happen.  They only way out of this uni token dumpster fire is by uniswap launching its own L1, but this is unlikely to happen bc eth religion is too strong. Have fun staying poor everyone. ",
