Centrifuge or BlockTower? 45:33 - ImdioR CFG: Talking about diversification. What is the Centrifuge team\u2019s view on implementing another stablecoin that could be used for Tinlake/Cent Pools(once launched)? 47:55 - Marcus: What do you believe is the biggest bottleneck for onboarding RWAs on-chain?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 52:37  Thanks to everyone. Stay tuned to the forums for the latest news. We look forward to seeing the work that Centrifuge is doing.
