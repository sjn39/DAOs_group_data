                    "content": "Hi frens, Here are some thoughts on how we can create more impact towards our mission of more coordination & reduction of coordination failures (sometimes we also call this \u201cbuild & fund public goods\u201d).  Framing Gitcoin is in the DAO coordination space, and we\u2019ve built a product suite that helps DAOs coordinate culture & capital. We envision a world in which there is many many DAOs\u2026  Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 12.58.00 PM1034\u00d7348 30.3 KB  with many many community members each  Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 12.57.51 PM1069\u00d7349 71.7 KB  The job of our software suite is to help coordinate these DAOS & knowledge workers. One important part of this to understand is that not all knowledge workers are created equal: When DAOS want knowledge workers to join their DAO, they don\u2019t want just ANY  knowledge worker to join their DAO - they want  knowledge workers who fit their values, working norms, skillsets, ambitions and other criteria. One way we can think about this is as a funnel.   Sourcing knowledge workers.  Selecting the right knowledge workers.  Selling them on your DAO.  Onboarding them to your DAO.  Retain them in your DAO.   Product Suite The tools that we\u2019ve built to do this are:   Bounties - gig-based work for web3 projects.  Hackathons - Build w the coolest web3 projects.  Grants - Crowdfunding for Open Source.  KERNEL - A web3-native, community centric accelerator.  tip.party - a small, modular tool for engaging people for showing up.  Quadratic Diplomacy - a decentralized tool for engaging contributors.  When you position these products along the funnel above, you can see how they complement each other, this is what it looks like:  How do we read this graphic?   Bounties  and Hackathons  both help DAOs source, select, sell, onboard knowledge workers.  KERNEL helps DAOs source, select, sell, onboard knowledge workers.  Grants - helps DAOs onboard & retain knowledge workers to DAOs.  tip.party - helps DAOs source + select knowledge workers who are highly engaged.  Quadratic Diplomacy - helps DAOs onboard & retain knowledge workers to DAOs.  Hopefully as we deploy this product suite in the DAO ecosystem, we are able to help our partner DAOs better source, select, sell, onboard, and retain talent.  Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 1.22.01 PM1060\u00d7425 95.8 KB   The view from a knowledge worker perspective\u2026 Why do knowledge workers engage with these products?  250k people have signed up to Gitcoin thus far because the product suite gives them \u2026  \u2026 opportunities to earn. \u2026 opportunities to learn. \u2026 opportunities to connect with one another & prospective career opportunities.   Network Effects I\u2019m a big believer in network effects.  The more DAOs that are in the Gitcoin network, the better the network is for community members of knowledge workers.  The more knowledge workers are in the network, the better it is for the DAOs in the network. As this flywheel spins, we\u2019re able to create impact, pull more data, and create more legitimacy.  This flywheel will eventually become a perpetual motion machine that reinforces itself.   Culture I believe that culture is a high order bit we want to optimize for.  Culture is very big deal in the crypto space, and I think that the future of public goods something is likely something that is hip moreso than some coercive & staid government entity. The culture that I see within the DAO is mission-first, producing results, creates memes/vibes in community, but is somewhat chaordic + is still evolving heavily.  Results so far Since its launch in November 2017 , Gitcoin has helped 42,814 funders reach an audience of 223,538 earners. Gitcoin has facilitated 1,143,518 complete transactions to 9,378 unique earners.  Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 1.03.40 PM922\u00d7281 17.6 KB   Feedback welcome. End to end this is how I see the investments in product creating results to our mission. I\u2019m open to feedback though! Also note that I\u2019m just one node in the Gitcoin network.

Looking forward to learn more about your thoughts on such a potential program, @lee0007, I know @ceresstation reached out to you about this. My main thoughts on such a program is that it should be an integrated part of either the MMM workstream or the Public Goods funding Workstream, where in a way an ambassador/partnership program is already being built out.

Brainstrom was def. on the to do list but not so easy for me as a new contributor to gather (let alone coordinate) a diverse representation of people. Instead leveraging existing gather spaces - like community calls and the forum to seek community input. The orbit infographic is super helpful to me and I will look to apply this high level overview in conjunction with the perspectives of each stream. ",
