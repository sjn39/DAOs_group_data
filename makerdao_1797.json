                    "content": "StakeWise has just announced its V3 upgrade which will be very relevant for Maker and its plans to utilise ETH staking within the PCV and ETHD. For context, StakeWise is undergoing a major upgrade and will soon transition to a fully permissionless protocol in a new two-layered model for liquid staking. This model will allow anyone who can run an Ethereum node to access the benefits of liquid staking on their own ETH or offer liquid ETH staking to their delegators. A link to the full announcement is found here (which includes a litepaper and explainer video), but to quickly summarise the relevant points for this discussion:   Layer 1: Isolated minipools (Vaults) will be created in a permissionless fashion by a single node operator or group of node operators. Vault parameters will be very flexible to satisfy the needs of any potential node operator. For example: A single Solo Staker could open a Vault to simply stake their own ETH (private Vault) and mint a liquid staked ETH token against their own node.   Layer 2: Based on the VLT tokens received by staking in layer 1, stakers will be able to mint osETH, an overcollateralised staked ETH token, to free up their staked capital for use across DeFi. This will be a Maker-style system, where osETH is borrowed at a dynamic LTV level, charged interest, has various peg stability mechanisms as well as a robust liquidations process.   How could this benefit Maker? StakeWise will of course pursue the addition of osETH to Maker as a collateral asset, but there are other interesting avenues to explore with this new model\u2026  Because of this two-layer approach, layer 2 allows any token that requires managed overcollateralised debt positions to be minted, like DAI or ETHD. This means anyone can get access to DAI with a higher capital efficiency and/or enter a leverage staked ETH position by using just StakeWise alone. The PCV specifically is an interesting use case: PCV mints DAI to buy ETH \u2192 ETH staked and DAI minted using VLT tokens \u2192 DAI sold to buy ETH which is also staked, etc\u2026  => ~2x leverage ETH price exposure and ~2x leverage ETH staking without the need for third-party money markets.  MakerDAO could become a node operator to stake its own ETH within StakeWise V3 and mint osETH/DAI to help manage the DAI supply, yield farm, or both. It could also accept ETH delegations from others to earn revenues as an operator. Utilise osETH to bootstrap development for ETHD. osETH will be re-pricing with deep liquidity and the in-built slashing protection will protect integrators from the systematic risks that other LSDs bring.  StakeWise V3 brings a lot of potential and the above outlines a few key areas where Maker could benefit. It would be great to see StakeWise V3 enter the discussions regarding Endgame / ETHD / Utilisation of PCV ETH. ",

The post discusses how this upgrade could benefit MakerDAO, including the potential for MakerDAO to become a node operator to stake its own ETH within StakeWise V3 and mint osETH/DAI to help manage the DAI supply, yield farm, or both. The post also suggests that StakeWise V3 could enter discussions regarding Endgame/ETHD/utilization of PCV ETH. The post extends the proposal and asks questions about its potential benefits.",
