McMichael (@brianmcmichael) Tags: governance Type: General Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2022-05-11 Date Ratified: 2022-06-27 Dependencies: None Replaces: None Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip74-permissionless-open-market-operations/15095 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmaivXCv   References   DssKiln - a permissionless token purchasing tool; a forum post introducing the module.  MIP74c1-Subproposal-Template.   Sentence Summary MIP74 defines the process used to agree and action permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO.  Paragraph Summary MIP74 defines the process that will be used to agree and take action on a number of permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. The MIP proposes the utilization of the DssKiln module in order to make permissionless open market operations over a predetermined time period. The DssKiln module can be used for but is not limited to: (i) altering asset allocations of the surplus buffer, (ii) DAO treasury management, and/or (iii) management of possible future funds controlled by Core Units or other bodies of MakerDAO. For example, the DssKiln is able to perform certain actions that the Maker community has previously proposed and discussed, including an alternative mechanism for MKR burning, and/or purchasing ETH with DAI from the surplus buffer.  Motivation The Maker community has had several ideas and discussions regarding potential asset management strategies controlled by MakerDAO governance. The DssKiln module is general enough to address the needs of several previously discussed ideas. DssKiln can be used to manage MakerDAO\u2019s surplus buffer, treasury, or any other assets on the Maker Protocol\u2019s balance sheet. There are other, possibly better, solutions that would require a greater time commitment from several Core Units and other stakeholders in the Maker community. This MIP, however, can be implemented relatively fast. It can fulfill a large spectrum of needs which are currently present. The DssKiln can serve its purpose until a better solution is identified, developed, and implemented.  Component Summary MIP74c1: Adding & Modifying a Permissionless Open Market Operation Defines the governance process for altering existing permissionless open market operations and proposing new open market operations. MIP74c2: Urgent Cancellation of a Permissionless Open Market Operation Defines the processes for cancelling an existing permissionless open market operation quickly. MIP74c3: Input by Bodies of MakerDAO Organizational Structure and Possible Limitations Defines the recommended input from bodies of MakerDAO. MIP74c4: DssKiln For Actioning Permissionless Open Market Operations Describes the DssKiln smart contract and defines the general parameters that all instances share. MIP74c5: DssKiln Examples Describes two specific examples that can be achieved with the DssKiln smart contract: (i) an alternative MKR buy back and burn mechanism, and (ii) periodically purchase tokens for the Maker Protocol treasury in a permissionless manner. MIP74c6: DssKiln Audit Confirms that DssKiln will be professionally audited prior to production use.  Specification  MIP74c1: Adding & Modifying a Permissionless Open Market Operation MIP74c1 subproposals must use the template located at MIP74c1-Subproposal-Template. This section of the MIP can have large consequences on the protocol\u2019s solvency, reserves and its financial resistance. A successful subproposal under this component will result in a technical state change to action and the proposal being included in an executive proposal within 1 month, absent any external factors.  The proposal parameters New permissionless open market operation which amounts to less than 3M DAI (or USD equivalent value) on annual basis or total per duration of strategy at the time of proposal may go into the Weekly Governance Cycle, provided the Feedback and Frozen Periods have been fulfilled. Anything above 3M DAI (or USD equivalent) on an annual basis or total per duration of strategy at the time of proposal must go through the Monthly Governance Cycle. Parameters for permissionless open market operation with less or equal to 3M DAI (or USD equivalent value) at the time of proposal on annual basis or total per duration of operation proposal:   Minimum Feedback Period: 2 weeks.  Minimum Frozen Period: 1 week.  Parameters for permissionless open market operation with above 3M DAI (or USD equivalent value) at the time of proposal on annual basis or total per duration of operation proposal:   Minimum Feedback Period: 4 weeks.  Minimum Frozen Period: 1 week.   MIP74c2: Urgent Cancellation of a Permissionless Open Market Operation Any permissionless open market operation which is implemented can be shutdown by a:  (i) Signal Request process which must last for equal or no less than 1 week and, (ii) Shutdown Process which does not require a Signal Request can be initiated by Facilitators of relevant Core Units. It is recommended, but not limited to, that Facilitators propose the shutdown to the on-chain poll and propose the immediate shutdown directly via executive vote only in the case of an emergency which is time-sensitive.   MIP74c3: Input by Bodies of MakerDAO Organizational Structure and Possible Limitations  Relevant bodies of MakerDAO are strongly recommended to provide input on MIP74c1 subproposals prior to formal submission. Expected bodies input which might be required and their potential tasks:  (i) PECU: Input on audit requirements and estimated cost (monetary and workforce related). Input on recommended destination market or similar (ii) Risk CU: Input on general and strategy specific parameters, input on recommended destination market or similar.    MIP74c4: DssKiln For Actioning Permissionless Open Market Operations DssKiln is a permissionless token-purchasing and disposition module for protocols that need to permissionlessly participate in open market activities. The following parameters are available for definition in DssKiln by Governance:   sell: the token to be deposited into DssKiln and sold.  buy: the token to be bought in exchange for the sold token.  hop: duration specified in seconds. It represents a minimum number of seconds that must pass before the lot can be sold.  lot: the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per hop.   MIP74c5: DssKiln Examples DssKiln can be implemented to interact with various on-chain markets. The specific operation which the DssKiln module is designed to perform is called a \u201cpermissionless open market operation\u201d. Each permissionless open market operation implementation, depending on which contracts it interacts with, requires operation specific parameters which are defined at contract creation. The following are example parameters specific to DssKilnUNIV3SaveStrategy. Other operations may require a different set of parameters;   uniV3Router: The address of the current Uniswap V3 router.  fee: The UniswapV3 fee pool DssKiln Strategy will participate in.  receiver: The destination address for the purchased token.  The following are example parameters specific to DssKilnUNIV3BurnStrategy. Other operations may require a different set of parameters;   uniV3Router: The address of the current Uniswap V3 router.  fee: The UniswapV3 fee pool DssKiln Strategy will participate in.  Note that this operation requires a token to have a burn() function, therefore there is no receiver because the DssKiln calls the burn() directly.  MIP74c6: DssKiln Audit DssKiln will be formally audited before implementation. The audit will be financed  and facilitated by PECU and their existing budget. The probable next technical steps are: (i) an internal PECU team review based on updated use cases and (ii) an external contract audit. These can be done in parallel.

                    "content": "Thanks for posting this. I think DssKiln could be a really interesting addition to the Maker Protocol. Two immediate use cases spring to mind:  More efficient flaps By utilising DssKiln in concert with DssVest and pointing the kiln at the burner address we could effectively reduce the slippage on flaps from around 4% to the Uniswap slippage which at present is 0.305% on Uniswap based on the current lot of 30,000 DAI. In other terms, this would be over 90% more efficient than a flap auction at burning MKR. Note this assumes that there would be no added costs to maintain the keeper network to perform the required contract calls. It also assumes Uniswap slippage would be constant but even at a slippage of 2% there would still be a 50% efficiency improvement. @makerburn posted in discord yesterday that we had spent 44.76M DAI in burns over the last 12 months, if we assume all of this had a slippage of 4% (which likely underestimates things given Flappy Friday) that is a loss to slippage of ~1.8 million DAI (or 1,200 MKR at a current market price of $1,500). If slippage had instead been 1% (conservative guesstimate) this would have been ~450,000 DAI (~300 MKR), a great improvement that would deliver value to MKR holders. Further, it reduces the priority for PE to look into using a reverse dutch auction system for flaps as previously mooted allowing them to focus on other tasks instead. It would also allow for a more structured approach to burning. At present we can use the lerp module to target burn rates but changes in stability fee income can mean that the buffer never reaches the lerped amount. By defining a set amount of DAI they wish to burn, it allows MKR holders more certainty that their vote will result in burn happening, while still allowing the buffer to grow over time if sufficient values for hop and lot are chosen.  Re-stocking the Treasury When we posted this signal request to determine the source of MKR used for vesting (mint vs treasury) several posters including @MakerMan and @omahalawyer expressed their support for an option to buy MKR from the market instead. At the time, no such option existed but we could use DssKiln to purchase MKR over time and then send it to the protocol treasury to replenish vested MKR. ",

Regardless of whether we want to spend on burn now, this is a useful piece of technical and process infrastructure that increases our options in the future. I would rather see future proposals to invest/utilize the buffer into on-chain assets come through a well-defined subprocess rather than through the top-level MIP process. While probably not perfect, this MIP at least specifies a base level of clarity for these proposals, and contains the infrastructure to manage them on an ongoing basis. Further, we could use this process to sell other treasury assets in a well-defined way, if we decided to do so. ",

I don\u2019t think this is a fair representation of what has happened, and is quite a strong accusation against GovAlpha. This MIP - being voted on here - does not \u201chide a burn\u201d. This MIP contains a technical description of DssKiln and the associated governance process. If passed it will not commence any burning of MKR. If it did \u201chide a burn\u201d GovAlpha would have pointed this out to the Community as it is obviously not the intention of the MIP. A separate proposal - voted on separately here and passed - proposed a trial deployment of the above technology which would burn MKR. This was a legitimate Signal Request that was live on the forum for two weeks and highlighted at the G&R. We have precedent for allowing trials of MIPs via the Signal process. Delegate compensation is one example that went through multiple signals and governance cycles prior to the MIP being approved (1, 2, 3, 4). ",

I don\u2019t need reminding of my votes. I am well aware I supported a specific request for the burn. All the more reason I want to be absolutely clear about the issue @Hasu raised. To reiterate my reason for voting in favor of that proposal, I will quote my onchain comments here: Voting yes here is a big reversal. ACREinvest until now has consistently signaled and polled no on burning MKR. In light of market conditions and challenges for the months to come, I favor supporting the views of a large part of the community regarding the burn at this time. You could say I\u2019m placing a new premium on compromise that boosts unity and morale where the trade off is controlled and appropriately risk-managed. I am comfortable with this trial given the limited scope as proposed here and, importantly, in light of recent liquidations increasing the SB over the past few days\u2026 plus, the technological experimentation is attractive. Given the brutal price action across the crypto ecosystem, an open market buy of MKR would be a very powerful signal now whether or not in the ordinary course the burn makes sense as part of normal operations.

I\u2019m open to feedback on how we can do better, but from my point of view, the signal and resulting poll were pretty clearly detailed as a measure for burning. While the vote itself was onchain for the standard 3 days (and it appears some voters missed it) the signal process took place for weeks before hand. This wasn\u2019t a low participation poll either, the vast majority of recognized delegates participated and communicated their reasoning for their vote. Shifting sentiment is a good reason to rehash a matter, but it\u2019s definitely not a good look for Governance to say sentiment is different less than a week later with no new information. In this case it seems a good chunk of voting power did not weigh in, which is an easy argument to mimic in the future considering the lower percentage of MKR in the voting contract.

I also want to add that personally I do not see value in burn until Maker is more developed and from the perspective of Risk CU, I am also against the burn. But I can understand that decentralized communities tend to break in half when there is no consensus reached on the topics which are very important to one side. This is why I, with the help of others, posted MIP74, which took quite some personal time. This is not in my mandate, this is completely voluntary. I saw a problem and wanted to do something about it, because nobody else did and I like Maker. After Burban posted his Burn v1, and later v2 SR, RiskCU needed to do something, because just lowering the surplus buffer to 54m is dangerous and not suitable for the current state. It was not clear who would win the vote, but from the start, it was leaning towards yes. So the only option was to ask the initiator of the SR, to cancel it to be 100% sure this is not passing. After discussing the topic for several hours with the initiator, we came to agreement that he will cancel the SR, if there is another SR to introduce burning back asap. I had to keep my promise, so after consulting with GovAlpha, the trial of the MIP as a SR was the outcome of this \u201cdeal\u201d with Burban. Just to be clear, the possibility of the MIP trial was confirmed before I promised anything to anyone. Otherwise, the burn would have been proposed using the MIP74 subproposal, assuming its confirmed. All of this is described in the Trial burn SR. Its a shame that people didnt raise their concerns during the forum poll, as the 3m over 3 months could easily be changed to longer duration or lower amount. So to conclude, there was zero sneaky peaky activity and the SR was on for 2 weeks. ",

When I first saw the poll for dsskiln I thought it was just to develop (the then already developed tech, but I can\u2019t honestly remember now).  When I saw the on-chain coupling the 3M specifically for MKR burn using the tech I was a bit surprised these were coupled together like this. I had already been thinking about burn and after noting the market conditions it seemed right to buy 3M DAI worth of MKR here because we basically pay almost for 1 yr of MKR vesting with significantly less DAI.   Also it looked like this would go off as a DCA vs. a 1 shot buy/burn etc. So yes I agree with some on the confusion regarding the way polling went here, but am reiterating a stance change similar to @ACREinvest in that I think it would be in MakerDAOs best interests to have a solution in place as well as cash on hand to buy MKR should these markets deteriorate so Maker can take advantage of the situation.   CUs in total are still sitting on 13-15M DAI here and we have earned what 7M DAI in liquidations. Personally I would rather have this go to Makershire since we can sink some MKR into a MKR-DAI or even MKR-ETH LP to earn return and provide liquidity.  BUT I keep coming back to something - even a little burn is better than none.   Even if it is 50K month every month unless we don\u2019t have the funds seems like a good idea to do than to do nothing at all.   So I have formally switched on burn to having some, just not a lot and ideally I\u2019d like it to be coupled to a Maker SPV earning return to fund it, or CUs paying back excess funds (funds we never expected to see) or whatever other creative funding ideas we can come up with to fund something that just burns 50K DAI/month month in/month out (this is only 600K/yr) but right now would be over 50MKR/month.

I think we need to present an alternative to have a chance at that, since just turning off the burn again would be received very badly IMO. Personally I like stretching it from 3 months to 12 months, so we still burn 3 million but we are much more likely to be doing it at the bottom of the market if we can assume it will come over the next year\u2026 But would be good with a dedicated thread to that (I\u2019ll make one soon if no one else does) As for MIP74, as I said above I am against putting in place subproposal process MIPs that are not to be permanent, and I don\u2019t believe it is good for Maker to have a long term process for arbitrary trading activity. It should be confined to the burn mechanism and a specialized mechanism for selling airdrops. Perhaps a simple amendment to MIP74 that narrows it scope would be sufficient. ",

The problem is that not having a subprocess doesn\u2019t prevent the proposals from taking place, it just ensures that they will use the higher level MIPs process, which is more general and has less guarantees around required information, templates and implementation. If you want to prevent active market operation proposals in their entirety, pass a MIP that says: \u201cNo proposals containing active market operations are permitted to go to vote, and automatically fail while this MIP is active.\u201d Otherwise you\u2019re just choosing the worst of both worlds - proposals with no standardization in their presentation or implementation, that are harder for governance to evaluate - exactly the situation sub-process definitions are there to avoid.

I agree that it wouldn\u2019t be a good precedent to simply re-vote on something when people don\u2019t like the outcome, but it sounds like the scope of the vote wasn\u2019t understood in the same way by the voting body, which would qualify for some kind of intervention. Is there something already implemented that might be a temperature check over time on whether MKR holders generally are pro or anti burn?
