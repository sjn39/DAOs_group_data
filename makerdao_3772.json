The existing YFI ilk \u2014 and Yearn in particular \u2014 have proven both profitable and less likely to experience liquidations than most other ilks. Allowing for an ilk that serves even more conservative users will steady both our profits and lower our risk. Note that ~65% of stability fee revenue is derived from ETH-A alone, and diversification of both collateral and user risk profile is essential for Maker to grow. On a more strategic note, these large users \u2014 of which Yearn is not in the top 5 \u2014 provide most of our revenue and most of our business. Their needs are our needs, as they provide steady revenue based on an underlying business rather than \u201cdegen\u201d market speculation. This makes the entire crypto ecosystem more stable, while the DAI they mint pushes our product in front of more users. These customers want to do business with us, have deep needs we can serve, advertise our product by their very usage of it, and experience tells us they are far less likely to be liquidated than smaller vault users because of sophisticated management techniques and more skin in the game. If you have not already done so, join me in voting YES to simply explore how to offer this product to our waiting customers. This is the way forward for Maker\u2019s financial empire to both grow profits and grow the user base we serve. ",

Without starting another thread, I think it\u2019s worth discussing what the arguments against this implementation might be. Let\u2019s list a few here.  In the event of a market crash, there might insufficient YFI liquidity to sell the collateral leading to losses on our end. This was discussed in the signal request thread and reading it again, it doesn\u2019t appear to have been resolved fully. Yearn\u2019s leverage on its own token was also raised in the same thread. In other words, when YFI crashes, it might crash too fast for us to liquidate vaults. Many members of the @Risk-Core-Unit were against the signal request.  While I cannot claim I know the issues deeply enough to comment further, there are quite a few red flags here. I\u2019m not sure if this is as cut and dried as your post makes it out to be @PaperImperium. ",

Put it simply, YFI-A is mostly utilized by Yearn alone and their risk parameters are being relaxed because of that. Which means that YFI-A vault is essentially becoming what Maker wanted to offer through YFI-C. Also YFI-C may force us to limit DC on YFI-A and upcoming YFI-ETH Sushi LP, because there is a limit on aggregate exposure through YFI leverage. Market cap of YFI is $1.4bn and I\u2019d say maximum debt exposure through YFI is 10-15% of market cap to keep it safe. ",
