Your ANON name, or your birth name will appear in the history books on how to achieve and run a decentralized autonomous organization. IMO, we cannot write history when we choose to not participate in Voting. As an example: why do we have 15 ETH addresses voting for adding Balancer as a Collateral Type, and only 8 ETH addresses acknowledging the Inclusion Poll for Declaration of Intent - Strategic reserves fund (MIP13c3-SP3)?? Please don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s because of high Tx Fees\u2013because as I write this on 10/14/2020, the average TX fee sits at 30GWEI. Please don\u2019t tell me that the Balancer folks are coming over and out-voting the Maker Community. And please don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because the WHALES will decide the outcome. Please provide a better excuse. Because I don\u2019t get it. How are we going to write the history books if you don\u2019t Rock the Vote? And I don\u2019t care which way you Vote. Just Vote. Please.

Yes, I know the new Governance contracts are being developed right now, with delegations and all. But for the future, we will not see serious voting engagement by the small MKR-holder until we find some good rewarding  mechanism. For \u201ccommunity member participation\u201d the SourceCred initiative is an excellent step in the right direction. But that does not affect at all onchain-voting. ",

Have the governance or someone ever thought in a system like a flash mint vote? For example, a person have the value of MKR in DAI, and they go through the Flash mint vote system (just for putting a name), swap the DAI for MKR, add it to the voting system, and when it finishes the MKR returns to DAI again? Maybe giving rewards if the vote they vote on wins (like paiyng the ETH used in that fee), because the community is involved IMO, the problem is with the vote as i see. ",

If people don\u2019t like what they are doing they can vote them out.   What you see now is a lot of collateral types that have been added with close to zero benefit to the protocol as many are barely used.  In my opinion, coin votes are not a good way to run a complex decision process and will ultimately lead to bad outcomes. ",
