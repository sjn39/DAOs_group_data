Encoding the function calls and search terms for desired outcome into a natural language system.  Can I borrow your brain for a second? I need you to try and wipe the idea of the address bar as a way to send and receive assets. Pasting in the janky addresses. Going through triple checking a bunch a characters to make sure they\u2019re correct, then finally pulling the trigger and clicking confirm. In fintech these are referred to as \u201cpayment intents\u201d where we have a finite path that user can go down to checkout. Sort of how you present different fields based on what payment method you choose, it\u2019s like a pre-defined path to collect the necessary information as seamlessly as possible to complete your checkout. An example for crypto would be with MakerDAO. \u201cDeposit collateral and generate DAI\u201d. Because it\u2019s a common use-case, a pre-defined intent of users opening CDP\u2019s it means that we can build a one click behaviour. It\u2019s a common theme, and will only trend more and more toward repeated value adding intents. Think of it more as a way to \u201ccommunicate\u201d your goals and intentions of your payment to a distributed system. Example Language  \u201cDeposit.ToSavings.eth\u201d (this deposits into compound, and returns CUSDC) \u201cdai.toBitcoin.eth\u201d (converts DAI to WBTC as outlined in the example above)  If you are looking for a simple mental model think of it this way\u2026 New users get something like an Amazon 1 click checkout for Ethereum smart contract interactions. New users get a familiar \u201cGoogle\u201d like interface UX/UI flow. ",

The proposal suggests encoding function calls and search terms into a natural language system to make the payment process more seamless. The post also invites feedback and constructive criticism on the proposal and advertises it as a way for new users to have a simple and familiar interface for Ethereum smart contract interactions.",
