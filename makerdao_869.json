                    "content": "Hi all! This applies to not only MIP68 but to other collaterals (or collateral technologies) involved with onboarding collateral. CES wants to bring in a little clarity to the collateral onboarding (COB) process especially as it relates to activities that follow a different process, non-MIP6 (MIP68, D3Ms, SRs, onchain polling, etc.) To date, Maker has primarily used the COB process, https://collateral.makerdao.com/, to onboard collateral. While less than perfect, the CMON and CMOFF stakeholders are spending a lot of time iterating to make the process better and provide more transparency. Today, the COB process starts with a MIP6. Currently, there are a variety of paths proposers of collateral are taking and initiating  with a non-MIP6 process. CES is open to supporting the community and evolving as new processes are presented. CES\u2019s responsibility is to follow our mandate as most of you have voted us to do. As part of that process, Maker has to find ways to balance the priorities of onboarding what I will term \u201cgreenlit\u201d collateral. In the past, Maker referred to greenlit collateral as something that has followed the MIP6 process leading to an onchain poll. Today, the community is experimenting with a variety of ways to signal there is a collateral Maker wants to add to the protocol. To support the needs of the community, CES will recognize a collateral as \u201cgreenlit\u201d if a non-MIP6 is ratified or an onchain vote positive vote has occurred for a specific collateral type. Taking this approach, the collateral stakeholders (Domain Teams) will be able to correctly prioritize all collateral work, regardless of how collateral is greenlit, to determine which collaterals are scheduled to be onboarded and continue with the COB process. CES is also committed to bringing greater transparency to the collateral onboarding priorities and statuses of WIP for collateral being implemented. We hope this increased level of communication will alleviate some of the growing pains we\u2019re all feeling right now. ",

I think this makes sense generally, and is a sensible path to take given the current ambiguity in onboarding processes. I will just point out that the \u2018experimentation\u2019 with new ways to onboard collateral is not really a new development, nor is it really experimentation. This has occurred because there are ambiguities around which \u2018process bucket\u2019 varying items should fall into. For something like onboarding a crypto-token, the collateral application process under MIP6 is pretty standard, and fits quite well, given that it was designed with that sort of token in mind. However this falls apart when it comes to things that are collateral types, but are also something else, ie:   PSMs - Incoming stablecoins end up as collateral of DAI, but MIP6 would not have been an appropriate process for onboarding the first, or even subsequent PSMs. As such, they went down the road of having technical MIPs, and signal requests.  RWA collateral - These required technical innovations and varying legal and transactional details that were not accounted for in MIP6, and so ended up as a mix of technical MIPs, and signals.  New vault-types for collateral that is currently supported. Stuff like ETH-B, wBTC-B, ETH-C, etc. This will become collateral, but it is collateral upon which governance has already voted, the collateral-part isn\u2019t in question, the parameter-part is in question, so signals fit better than MIP6.  D3M\u2019s are the latest in this line of \u2018things that don\u2019t quite fit.\u2019  The top-level MIPs process and the Signal Request process are both specifically designed to be as flexible as possible, which is why they are used more in the case of ambiguity. The way to standardize collateral onboarding is to define and ratify processes such that this ambiguity is no longer present, or such that it\u2019s captured by a separate process. At this point, I would strongly recommend removing MIP6 and the associated MIPs, and replacing them with something built from the ground up to deal with the ambiguity in various collateral structures in such a way that encourages standardization. MIP6 and the other early MIPs were not built with this in mind, and will likely always be weaker and less suitable than a process designed around our current goals. ",

The short-term approach is to accommodate the ambiguity in the system. The long-term approach would be to modify the application process (MIP6, etc). I think we can do this in parallel to prevent blockages with the current collateral flowing through the system. The top priority right now is to increase the transparency of the COB process.

As I read it, it\u2019s actually pretty significant how impactful some of this thinking could be. I\u2019m not sure I agree (maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding) why we\u2019re combining technical and collateral risk here? As I understand it, D3M is a technical solution, no different than MIP-21, MIP-22, or \u201cnew vault-types\u201d as @LongForWisdom rightly called out. But I\u2019m curious why MIP-6 is getting thrown into this thinking here. I could be reading wrong so I wanted to put down some of my thoughts and get a simple True or False as a way to clarify the process. If I\u2019m way off the mark, maybe it\u2019s just a matter of having a quick call and then reposting to the Community (I\u2019m happy to do it) and get some cross-unit / cross-domain thinking here. So here is my list of statements for True / False:   MIP-6 is a required step for all collateral, whether CMON (on-chain) or CMOFF (off-chain) - Launch of the New Collateral Status Index (CSI)   MIP-6s that are evaluated by the Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF CU) are now held to the Methodology for Review by the vote that ratified MIP-67 into the Collateral Onboarding Process.   Any applicant, no matter which technology solution they choose, must have submitted a MIP-6.   A final assumption I\u2019ve been working with: As it pertains to RWA collateral, that is natively off-chain, but may be brought on-chain through Centrifuge or underpin some of the loans that Maker makes through various technology solutions, the MIP-6 (and now accompanied by MIP-67) was responsible for housing the legal and collateral risk evaluated for any applicant seeking capital from Maker. I might be over-placing importance on MIP-6, but without it and MIP-67, I don\u2019t see how the Maker Community has an overarching document in place to ensure all collateral is risk assessed. Excited to work through this as always with you. ",

Today, the Collateral Onboarding process is built around starting with the MIP6. Why? For me, the more complete the application, the quicker it moves through the process. Yes, there is more upfront work to do and I feel that is properly placed. For example, why would we want to wait until the assessment phase to figure out what collateral is actually being onboarded? Some of the Signal Requests right now will force us to do that therefore delaying the process of moving the collateral through the system. Let\u2019s have a complete collateral application, upfront, so we don\u2019t have to spend time later in the process to figure it out. The newly ratified collateral application updates, the MIP guidelines, and the MIP67 allow us to do this.   False. This is based upon the Maker governance process. What I can provide is to publish guidelines (as we\u2019ve done) to help collateral applicants understand how they get the time with the CES CU and the collateral stakeholders. This process is my commitment to give all collateral a consistent and timely process when applying. If applicants decide to use a different process, that is up to them and I have no idea of the results or timing.   True. MIP67 has been ratified by the community. RWF has clearly stated they are using MIP67 to help applicants prepare for a MIP6 application. @williamr Please comment if needed.   False. See #1. Also, you can\u2019t onboard technology, only assets. Every applicant that does not clearly outline the collateral to be onboarding is at risk of consuming a lot of time from many stakeholders leading to a frustrating process. My request is to define all this upfront, in a MIP6, to achieve harmony with the process and stakeholders.   To reply to your final comments, the only thing I can say is, we have a process and I would ask that applicants follow the process. It starts with a MIP6 application. In the past there was an issue with getting collateral through the system and knowing statuses for collateral in the process. That is no longer the case. There is a little more clean up to do (the basis of some of your questions) so keep that in mind. We have several collaterals that have not followed the COB process so we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. As you can expect, there are a few exceptions to the MIP6 application. These mainly deal with creating new vaults with collateral that has already been onboarded. The above is not this. I only bring that up since there will be Signal Requests for these situations and it\u2019s the correct vehicle to bring those changes (parameters, etc.) into the protocol. ",

Correct me if my logic doesn\u2019t make sense: but if I was applying to finance collateral through MakerDAO, and there are no indication of how Applicants are prioritized (whether they follow preferred process of the CUs or not), wouldn\u2019t I simply apply in the way that best benefits me and creates greatest opportunity for success?

The Phase II of the COB process is being worked on now and will provide even more clarity for onboarding collateral. It will also streamline some things and reduce timeframes. Re: prioritization, what is being fixed is helping applicants understand where they stand. The dimensions on the Prioritization tab are being reviewed and updated, where needed, and will be the basis for a prioritization summary. This will provide more specific information to applicants. When that gets implemented (<4 weeks), an incomplete collateral application would rank very low in prioritization and the applicant would need to spend time updating whatever they used as their collateral application (MIP6, SR, MIP). That would be a huge issue for MIPs since they might have to be amended\u2026another 60 day cycle. With SRs, there might be a lot of back and forth with the clarification leading to frustration and extended timeframes. While there might be a dislocation in the process and future applicants, it\u2019s probably due to an applicant either with a lack of understanding of the COB process and/or getting advice from non-collateral stakeholders. I love feedback to help make our processes better. Getting involved, like you are doing, supports improving what we do and how we do it. I\u2019ll continue to share that CES is available to help collateral applicants understand the process and technology with collateral onboarding. We are here so please reach out if you have question. I\u2019m pretty sure Growth and RWF would make the same offer. Ultimately,  the collateral applicant makes the choice. Choose wisely!  ",

I wouldn\u2019t categorize that as legal in the sense of collateral risk legal.   Not the on-chain/smart contract risk per se, but some of the agreements / covenants that implement what happens next (these are off-chain). I am trying to understand the extent to which the agreement/covenants are divorced from the smart contract. ",

For CES, the implementation work we do is to understand the technical implications of using current collateral technology when onboarding a piece of collateral. Today, many of the collateral technology solutions are multipurpose. This is challenging since we talk about an \u201cout of a box\u201d solution but I\u2019ve yet to see one. For the D3M, PE has developed the collateral technology and when the audits and such are complete, we\u2019ll use the latest refactor they have been working on. The overall technical risk of the D3M is being handled through the development process. When CES onboards collateral using a D3M, there is a lot to look at. A Compound D3M is different than a Maple Finance D3M. There is the initial development and the ongoing maintenance for any collateral onboarded using the D3M. All of this has to be evaluated for technical risk. Technical, collateral, and legal risk are intertwined as we have learned. The good news is that we have CUs/people to look at each of these risks and make assessments so the protocol is covered. ",
