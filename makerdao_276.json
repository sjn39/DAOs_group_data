This is exactly what the PSM is designed for, but these arbitrage facilities work best when freely flowing in both directions. This poll is to gauge sentiment for reducing the \u201ctin\u201d (or toll for inflows) of the USDC PSM to 10 bps. It is currently set to 20 bps. Justification The USDC PSM tin was raised to 20 bps upon the introduction of the USDP PSM in an attempt to migrate some dollar-proxy reserves from the USDC PSM to the newly established USDP PSM. The USDP PSM is now nearly full, and accounts for close to half of all circulating USDP supply.  Screen Shot 2021-10-31 at 10.28.00 AM948\u00d750 7.87 KB  Because of the lack of capacity in the USDP PSM, it is time to equalize the tin fee for all (at the moment two) PSMs. The goal for raising the tin to 20 bps has been met, and there is no reason to favor inflows to a PSM that is nearly at capacity. Additionally, since the introduction of a 20 bps tin for the USDC PSM, inflows to that PSM have generally halted. While credit risk from exposure to USDC is still as real as it has ever been, Maker does depend upon the PSMs to provide peg stability for DAI, and less friction is probably better \u2013 even while we wait upon more PSMs or opportunities to diversify our USDC reserves beyond simple PSM smart contracts. Exposure to USDC has dropped in both absolute and relative terms, which is good, but Maker still needs this arbitrage facility to be widely utilized and fairly frictionless to support a tighter real-time peg for DAI <> USD. Next Steps This poll will run for 7 days. Upon an affirmative vote (yes votes > no votes), an on-chain poll will be presented to the community.    Should both USDC-PSM and USDP-PSM tin be set to 10 bps?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

For the record, I think setting all tin/tout to 0 is probably not the right move at the moment and will be voting against it. Edit: To remove any chaos should the first SR pass and then this one pass, I have edited the poll to specify that both PSM tin parameters be set to 10 bps, to avoid a situation where USDP has a 0 bps tin and USDC has a 10 bps tin.

Several members (@rune @Nadia) have pointed out that even these small deviations are sufficiently large that it hurts them in lining up deals. These proponents would want 1 DAI = $1 and hence set the tin and tout to 0 for any PSM because by having a PSM, we implicitly trust that that stablecoin is pegged correctly all the time. I think without this, we\u2019re going in circles by first having a fee, then setting it to zero and then going back to having a fee again. ",

I personally think there are good reasons to keep a tiny amount of friction (that\u2019s equal between PSMs) because it\u2019s less jarring to raise existing ones with a non-zero tin when we want to encourage a new PSM to be used. And especially before we have some way to take excess PSM reserves and put them to some off-chain use. But it\u2019s not going to be bad for Maker to go with the \u201call approved stablecoins are fungible\u201d policy. It just removes some modest tools from our monetary policy toolkit in exchange for deepening the liquidity of all other stables. We will need to keep an eye on stable-stable LPs, though, if we find they are unprofitable for users under that policy. They make up a growing (and fee generating) source of collateral, and also help diversify our blacklist/regulatory risk. ",
