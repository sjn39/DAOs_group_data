                    "content": "Contributors: @adcv @Aes @hexonaut @teej @luca_pro @Nadia @SebVentures To pick up the threads discussed in Against the Burn, a16z Tokenomics Part 3, Aggressive Growth Strategy and A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy, we would like to share some views that we have been developing over the past few months. We wanted to share them with the broader community to gather actionable feedback and stimulate a lively discussion - and hijack some of the threads that have popped up such as [Discussion] Capital Raise. It is important to remind the community that we speak only for ourselves as a passionate and informal group of contributors to this amazing protocol. Our hope is that engaging these ideas with our community of mandated actors and tokenholders will prompt concrete plans that will help us come together to push Maker to new heights. Ultimately the tokenholders will decide what direction they want to take the protocol in. The context we\u2019re in is very difficult and a deleveraging cycle in the crypto economy is adding to the pressure of an already competitive market in crypto lending. To face these challenges and provide some direction for where we believe we should be investing our efforts as we build during this bear market, we wanted to open a discussion on how we think about Maker\u2019s position in the market and where we believe Maker\u2019s strengths can be leveraged for growth in the future. We look forward to your thoughts and feedback on the below framework. Thank you.   Foundations of a Growth Oriented Strategy Maker is a unique creation, a permissionless programmatic balance sheet lender and mainstay of DeFi with the potential to revolutionize the world. Below are some of the structures of the House of DAI that include foundations of where the protocol is today (#1/#2) and the primary pillars of explosive growth for the future (#3,#4, and #5). Maker builds atop one of the strongest financial and cultural bedrocks that exist in DeFi. At the core is the asset base of the protocol. Today it lies fallow, an asset-liability mismatch that exposes the protocol to myriad risks (interest rate, duration, liquidity, etc) that will accrue value to the protocol. It needs to be the beating heart of the protocol, invested conservatively but managed productively. Maker has built, through the energy of its community and vibrant DAO, a beautiful beast. Its fully permissionless software apparatus governs the crypto-loan and arbitrage infrastructure lying at the core of DeFi today. This growth has enabled the accumulation of a surplus buffer to shoulder risk for the protocol and avoid a repeat of the insolvency the protocol went through in 2020. Maker\u2019s surplus buffer should become the risk-foundation needed to support Maker\u2019s expansion into key business lines we know it is well-suited to lead in. With that said, in its current size, it is far from where it needs to be to absorb risk at the moment when Maker increases its exposure to various risks across protocols, different chains and RWAs. Following the aggressive drawdowns of the past few months, we are in a more comfortable risk position today. However, our current surplus buffer design is a brake on scaling and too slow to accompany growth in some of the initiatives we believe Maker has a unique competitive advantage in. We should prepare ourselves to scale it progressively as we demonstrate to the community that new, and profitable, growth can be achieved. The first pillar of growth (#3) is to become the first programmatic lender in the emerging DeFi money markets through D3Ms and institutional vaults. The second pillar (#4) is to become the stablecoin of reference for retail users in a multi-chain universe through MCD on Layer 2s/multi-chain and an in-house Maker Teleport system that connects the ecosystem with DAI as the base currency. The final pillar (#5) is to face the music and foment the revolution in real-world lending that Maker itself kicked off. For DAI to fulfill the promise of DeFi, we must push outside the narrow halls of crypto into the vast world of crypto-uncorrelated assets. Real-world organic demand should be the protocol\u2019s end-goal and winning in this market means laying the decentralized financial rails that connect crypto and the real world. Amidst the collapse of short-term and unsustainable business models, the House of DAI is as grounded and powerful as ever. The market has been rudely reminded that Maker has consistently demonstrated its prudence and is living up to its reputation as a conservatively run safe harbor - the key elements for establishing the foundations of a de-central bank of reference. In order to build off this momentum and seize market share, we believe Maker should execute on three key areas it has already laid the infrastructure for. Establish DAI as the center of a new clean economy  Invest our assets productively - and in accordance to prudent liquidity management Scale our surplus buffer quickly and programmatically, in line with new growth Become the wholesale lender of choice for crypto and real world alike   imageLikeEmbed-81040\u00d7720 111 KB   1. Strengthen DAI\u2019s Resilience with Active Treasury Management As most of those here know, the Maker protocol has tremendous liquidity with about $4.4B in stablecoins on the balance sheet as of this morning. Investing a modest portion of this treasury via a prudent investment strategy would net the protocol millions in revenue, immediately. While it is not currently possible to invest directly in DeFi due to our size, we are exploring several strategies to mobilize our stablecoin assets through short-term, liquid instruments (primarily US treasuries). Our first foray (MIP65) will be by deploying a portion of the treasury, in an off-chain manner, in short-term bond ETFs. These ETFs should be mostly invested in short duration treasuries, are highly liquid, and will enable the Maker protocol to earn attractive yield while maintaining the highest quality of credit and ample liquidity. This is the first step and we will diversify further with additional leading asset managers across the globe. Long-term, the end game is to deploy our capital through tokenized real-world financial assets. We are already seeing a cohort of start-ups as well as traditional asset managers tackling the tokenization challenge.  imageLikeEmbed1040\u00d7720 134 KB   2. Build a Permissionless Foundation from Supportive Investors The first step to unlocking this growth is to fill up the surplus buffer, or cushion, to robust levels. Far from being a pool of capital functional to finance investments that couldn\u2019t be covered by ongoing profitability, a surplus buffer is a capital cushion to protect the protocol from \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019, or risks that although yet unobservable do indeed exist. Maker has already learned through its young life how over-collateralisation cannot be the answer to every shock. The simplest and least desirable way to do this would be issuing new MKR, diluting existing holders. We do not want this, and propose instead an innovative and accretive capital raise through debt-like tokens that serve exclusively to shore up our risk-buffer. All of the below can be achieved in a permissionless way, with capital-holders depositing their tokens in a permissionless smart contract that integrates with the rest of the protocol. You can find more ideas and a wider discussion on the subject on @luca_pro Dirt Roads. Because DAI retains its position as the most desirable, decentralized stablecoin in crypto, alternative layer 1\u2019s and side-chains are (financially) eager to host liquidity for it. Ecosystem incentives from side-chain participants can help insure chain-specific risks at attractive costs of capital. We could create innovative structures on top of grants or strong collateral guarantees that can be locked up permissionlessly and be dedicated exclusively to insure against chain-specific or bridge-specific vulnerabilities. Yield bearing vaults, both expiring and non-expiring, a form of stDAI, could provide a layer of excess coverage (senior to the surplus buffer) against potential losses. Beyond building another layer of risk-capital with no discretionary spending ability, the yield paid by these vaults could evolve to become a reference or benchmark rate, given Maker\u2019s role as the de-central bank of DeFi. Such a benchmark might underpin(the longer-dated end of) a rates market native to DeFi with a continuous tradeable yield curve. At the spot end of the curve is a DSR, possible only if we manage our assets productively. Issuance of these bonds would be tied programmatically to increases in risk exposure as the protocol grows to improve efficiency of the use of capital. Finally, bonds backed by treasury MKR with a sufficiently conservative liquidation price could provide a final and minor incentive-aligned source of capital without diluting existing tokenholders. These sources of capital should combine into three layers: a new multi-chain insurance pool, an expansion of our existing surplus buffer, and an impregnable risk-absorption layer to protect DAI holders from volatile market conditions.  imageLikeEmbed-31040\u00d7720 160 KB   imageLikeEmbed-41040\u00d7720 112 KB   3. Scale Crypto-Lending, the Core of MakerDAO While Maker started off with a product that found fast retail adoption, the realities of scaling constraints meant that Maker evolved towards a new form of its core product with very strong market fit: Whales and B2B2C vaults for large pools of concentrated retail capital with a few key platforms as frontends. Crypto lending is the core of Maker today and we should continue to grow it with deeper B2B2C integration through Institutional Vaults with predictable parameters, attractive for long-term institutional use. On the other side, in the D3M Maker has found a scalable platform for becoming a wholesale lender for specialized protocols, supplying DAI liquidity programmatically. The key benefit of the wholesale lending approach is the specialization effect of focusing Maker on its key strengths - a large, in practice infinite, balance sheet and robust backing - while allowing specialized platforms to do what they do best - originate specialized volume, create retail demand and pair DAI as a DeFi native base currency with other emerging currencies. We find many similarities between the D3M protocol-to-protocol approach, and @Rune\u2019s MetaDAO vision \u2013 the D3M is an organic version of the DAO-to-DAO construct championed by our founder.  imageLikeEmbed-51040\u00d7720 124 KB   4. Drive Native Retail Adoption in a Multi-Chain Universe As DAI (should be our North Star), we need to find retail users again. To give DAI stable end-user demand, Maker needs to go to where the users are, and the users are drifting to Layer 2s and multi-chain. A robust infrastructure is necessary to reach all of these players and Maker is on the way to positioning itself at the center of an ecosystem with Maker MCD, DAI and Maker Teleport at the core. We are very excited to be close to releasing Maker Teleport and look forward to bringing some of the other ecosystems online in the coming months with, as always, a focus on robustness and conservatism above all else to protect the integrity of DAI and its holders and users.  imageLikeEmbed-61040\u00d7720 109 KB   5. Fulfill the Promise of DeFi by Bringing Dai to the Real World In January of 2021, Maker and its partner platform Centrifuge launched the maiden voyage of Real World Assets on-chain. This was a foundational signal to the market as to our legitimacy, maturity, and boldness. RWAs would go on to 15 months later to pass the 35M threshold, drive uncorrelated revenues, and bolster the peg. In the interim, many protocols, lenders and stablecoins alike, have followed along on a path that Maker has beaten through the woods. Today, Maker is evolving its RWA approach toward a wholesale lending model. This paradigm is really geared around the basic principles of specialization\u2014we want to enable expert lenders to execute their core businesses without unnecessary micromanagement. Rather than underwriting on an asset-by-asset basis, Maker can underwrite the underwriter. This model is scalable, repeatable, modular, and easily toggled as per the performance of our partners. With regard to the wholesale lending model, HVB exemplifies what we want to see in our off-chain partners: reputable, regulated counterparties with demonstrable domain and geographic expertise. A new cohort of hybrid platforms, such as Maple and TrueFi, take a hybrid approach where they connect DeFi capital markets to real world operators. Such platforms exemplify Maker\u2019s wholesale model on-chain. Where does the future of \u201cRWAs\u201d lie?. We think the holy grail is to unlock completely native on-chain credit markets. MakerDAO is well positioned to serve as the liquidity foundation at the core of this novel asset class. As the fixed income world is flipped upside down by the determinism of smart contracts and the transparency of distributed ledgers, MakerDAO will via wholesale lending establish the true potential of smart contract lending.  imageLikeEmbed-71040\u00d7720 92.2 KB  ",

Hey @flipflopflapdelegate , the  Self Insurance Fund you refer to covers a different contingency. It is a legal defense fund in case of legal action against a DAO member (similar coverage to a D&O insurance in the corporate world). We are currently documenting the overall legal risk exposure, more details will come soon! ",

We\u2019ve seen this senior pool incentive method in other protocols, just wonder how big can this senior pool become and at what cost. A different question     adcv:  A new cohort of hybrid platforms, such as Maple and TrueFi, take a hybrid approach where they connect DeFi capital markets to real world operators. Such platforms exemplify Maker\u2019s wholesale model on-chain.   Some of these protocols position themselves as under collaterized. How do you see DAI (over collaterized) exposing to these protocols. Do you foresee a certain exposure limit to avoid moving away from our over collaterized stance, if so, what is the limit? How do we, as a community can come to an agreement on such limit. Thanks for the post ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your reply Miguel, having helped in drafting some of those points let me give you quick answers. No, I don\u2019t think anyone has done supply-demand analysis on what type of yield would be required to at least boostrap stDAI mezz protection layer. At least I haven\u2019t. But I am planning to do it as independent researcher. I think that being in control of its balance sheet, and having the D3M connections in place with the largest money markets in crypto - like Compound and Aave, Maker has the potential to influence rates in the industry. Especially if we structure some sort of perpetual staking - or meta-currency yielding, solution. Personally, I think the situation for Maker would be very different from other protocols, as the mezz staking protection could be in the range of 100-200M vs. 10b of outstanding DAI. So I guess there wouldn\u2019t be any need for aggressive pricing. A lot to research here, I am planning to do it in my independent capacity and would love your input. I think you are making a crucial point on over/ under collateralisation. To me, it is a bit like reducing the engines of a plane from 4 to 2. There is some statistics in the mix to assess risk tolerance and loss absorption. Somehow, it is the same when we onboard tokens that are not entirely blue chip for a vault. Their market cap and liquidity provide gives us an indication of the robustness of that collateral valuation. With the lending stack becoming deeper and more complex, I guess we could see many more tokens representing different tranches of a lending pool appearing that a Maker could onboard. Evaluating the robustness of such valuation will be key, and a key governance decision indeed. Ultimately I think that talking about over and under collateralisation is not entirely accurate, and as usual the devil is in the detail. $LUNA, for example, had a liquid valuation, but was a vault collateralised at 150% vs $LUNA an over-collateralised vault? Thanks for those inputs, I think you are touching on some of the most fascinating points of DeFi. And ping me if you want to bump ideas, I am looking forward to it. ",

                    "content": "    adcv:  On the other side, in the D3M Maker has found a scalable platform for becoming a wholesale lender for specialized protocols, supplying DAI liquidity programmatically.   Let us stop propagating the myth that D3M is some magic technology that can allow Maker to wholesale lend to other protocols programmatically. The reality is that MD has one successful implementation - AAVE - that uses this protocol, and is in the process of onboarding another protocol Compound. What both of these implementations have in common is that supply and demand of DAI can be adjusted upward and downward on a pure programatic basis - by targeting the demand/supply of DAI within these protocols by adjusting supply against a target yield. Having completed a comprehensive risk assessment of one of the under-collateralized protocols detailed in your diagram ([Maple] Protocol & ERC20 Token Assessment - D3M Signal Request). It is clear that targeting the supply and demand programatically of these lending based protocols is not practical - as the relative low liquidity of these underlying protocols makes it extremely difficult if not near impossible to reduce the investment programatically - as automated withdrawals of supply from these credit driven protocols - without manual intervention and monitoring - have a medium to high probability of creating a credit crunch which could significantly impact collateral value. Finally, for credit driven lending protocols, if the supply demand of DAI injected into those target protocols is providing liquidity when there is no demand, potentially MD is propagating  mis-pricing in these protocols - especially if the demand for these protocols is not there because there is no market risk appetite for these underlying loans - or just a lack of market demand for the underlying pool tokens because the market does not have appetite for this credit risk. It is my personal view for the reasons detailed above - that it is completely wrong and potentially misleading for any core unit to propagate the myth that  D3M is a scalable platform for wholesale lending and the result has been that a lot of core unit contributors are spending a lot of time and effort responding to use cases that are not appropriate, instead of innovating on more appropriate tech for these use cases.

I am specially excited about the potential of L2 bridges driving retail-user demand, one thing we know of this segment of clients is that they are cost-conscious, wanting exposure to a USD peg at zero-low cost. This may attract millions of users from third world countries to sophisticated traders, thus increasing use cases across the spectrum. Bridge safety though should be optimal and guides may need to be translated into multiple languages. On the treasury management and RWA side, the potential is incredible. Being able to source USD investments globally that provide optimal risk/reward ratio is something that not even the biggest global banks in the world (i.e. JPM and Citi) could do. MIP65 is historic but its just the beggining. One last area or possibly pillar that I think might be worth adding, even though is still years away, is a bucket for private crypto investments vetted by SFU and approved by MKR holders. ",

I would consider myself as \u2018retail\u2019 and the pains that I have to go through to open a CDP is very prohibitive for mass adoption. Maker Teleport IMO will only help marginally to drive retail adoption, it will definitely help big players source and move liquidity between L2s. We desperately need MCD on L2s with lower dust parameter to allow smaller loans, and lower gas fee costs. Is it also the view of PECU that we would be able to deploy MCD on L2s like optimism and arbitrum within this year Q4? Will the implementation be somewhat modular/similar across different L2s? I have not seen much update or progress on this area, which is why I am quite surprised to see the expected dates given. ",
