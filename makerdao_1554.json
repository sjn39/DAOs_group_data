Background For context, see: [SIGNAL REQUEST] Budget Re-allocation & Core Unit Accountability Framework The Target Spend Level is the maximum spend amount expressed in DAI (excluding gas) that MKR holders and delegates are willing to spend over the next 6 months. The Target Spend Level is a key commitment mechanism in the proposed budgeting process and allows MKR holders and delegates to easily express a view on protocol level profitability in the short term.  Rationale To reflect the result of the vote to return to cash flow breakeven, MKR holders and delegates must vote to reset the spend level of the DAO. While the original signal poll was framed on a percentage of revenue basis, for budgeting purposes the DAO should commit to a targeted spend level (i.e. $25M) for two reasons. Firstly, committing to a percentage of revenue cash flow target requires an accurate revenue forecast for the next 6 months, which is extremely difficult given volatile crypto markets. Secondly, there is no DAO-wide consensus on the next 6 month revenue, and MKR holders and delegates should not have to trust Strategic Finance\u2019s revenue forecasts by default. Instead, MKR holders and delegates can express their views on the next 6 months revenue and corresponding total spend by simply voting on a Targeted Spend Level. Setting a top down Targeted Spend Level allows MKR holders and delegates to commit to a desired maximum level of spend and corresponding protocol profitability before the budgeting process commences. In addition, the Targeted Spend Level provides an important signal of MKR holder\u2019s appetite for spend to Core Units as they develop their Core Unit Budget Proposals. Voting and committing to a Target Spend Level before the capital allocation process forces MKR holders to make capital allocation tradeoffs that honor their initial commitment.

In practice, setting a level of desired spend through this SR is not a MIP or budget replacement but serves as guidance to building up budget proposals that could aim to serve the asked-for value. The outcome could well be a set of acceptable budget proposals all of which are above or slightly above the targeted amount selected here. e.g. selected level: $20m Eventually the collection of alternative bottom-up budget proposals could look like Budget Proposal A: $21m Budget Proposal B: $40m Budget Proposal C: $15m And you could well have budget proposal B win if it contains projects that MKR holders believe in and capture the \u2018spirit\u2019 of this SR if not the specific number. You can imagine that the budget proposals that come closest to the selected view have the highest likelihood of getting passed. ",

Other important matters to understand as an input in the overall Target Spend Level: Is a governance restructuring in the cards with higher compensation for Delegates? Do we need new compensated roles in the DAO to improve overall management, coordination, accountability and execution across CU functions (whether Delegates, council or other\u2026)? What about legal, compliance and regulatory response resources? Can we know what is reasonable on spending without knowing what the DAO wants to look like in 6months - 5 years? ",
