Even as a non dev, its crucial to understand how these tools work, delegating your vote, etc. Gitcoin has created a great onboarding for users through the delegate/claim process. If you have specific things you are looking to learn, I would highly suggest joining the Gitcoin discord and also posting about what you want to learn into the Gitcoin town square. ",
