The pool currently has only 25$k in liquidity which the only pool across all dexes with liquidity (according to 1inch). This isn\u2019t enough to use renZEC as a novel way to mix funds and gain privacy on Ethereum. Example use case: You have a Ethereum address with a awkward amount of eth, lets say 45.8 eth. Mixing that would require 4x 10 eth and 5x 1 eth mixes with tornadocash. And have some eth left over aswell. But with a liquid renZEC pool you would only need 1 mix of 0.1 eth to get a private address to pay for gas and use zcash to mix the rest. Pros  Cheaper mixing of funds then mixers like tornadocash. More flexibility in mixing amounts. Another liquid coin on uniswap from another chain.  Cons  Price exposure to zcash during mixing. renZEC is still custodial as AFAIK (but wont be in the future). Complicated UX to mix like this and maybe too novel. Layer 2 solutions like aztecs ZK\u00b2 Rollup make this obsolete in the future.  renVM: https://renproject.io/ Also Zook seemed excited by the what this pool could enable  : https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1283861008143003649 ",
