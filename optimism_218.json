Usages statistics as of posting: Wallet Basics (Released Feb 2022) 7465 Intro to DeFi (Released Feb 2022) 5877 Blockchain Basics (Released June 2022) 259 Academy Community (Released July 2022) 354 Web3 Security (Released Aug 2022) 105 Increasing metrics through SBT badge distribution: Since ETHDenver, our team has partnered with MintKudos.xyz to issue soulbound token badges to users who complete Academy lessons, allowing our community to display on-chain verification of their general onboarding and per-topic training. To mitigate badge farming and other sybil-behaviour, only users who have completed proof of personhood through our Gitcoin Passport integration will receive Academy badges. This sybil-protection gateway opens up the possibility for other on-chain rewards in the future. (Note: we will also be enabling retroactive badge claim for users who decide to complete proof of personhood at a later time.) Onboarding users to Optimism: For context, the Bankless Academy onboarding experience aims to guide users from Centralised Exchange through to becoming a DeFi/NFT/DAO Hero on Ethereum - building skills they can then take with them to other ecosystems should they choose. Our \u2018Essentials\u2019 onboarding journey includes:  Going Bankless Wallet Basics Web3 Security Blockchain Basics Layer 1s: Ethereum and the Trilemma Layer 2s: Solving the Trilemma  This is followed by a branching of paths, allowing the user to follow their curiosity deep into topics of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more. We believe that by ending this \u2018Essentials\u2019 path with a lesson that shows engage with Layer 2s (in this case, Optimism), Bankless Academy can drive a large number of users to:  begin using Optimism as their default Layer 2 DeFi & NFT solution, complete Ethereum proof of personhood, discover and consider joining Optimism\u2019s Citizen House, purchase OP tokens to engage in Optimism governance. flex their collection of Academy SBT credentials on the Optimism ecosystem, opening up an exciting range of possible ecosystem chemical reactions.  Our lessons also include an on-chain quest at the end, for which we would like to use a relevant Optimism service that helps the user test their knowledge on the topic of Layer 2s. We\u2019d like to open this up as a topic of conversation with the Optimism community. As an example, our Wallet Basics lesson briefs the user on wallet types and best practices, before finally linking them to a Metamask download and asking them to come back once installed to sign their first message and claim their first badge. We also work with off-chain questions when appropriate. Our Blockchain Basics lesson runs the user through the basic functions of blockchain technology, and then requires them to enter the To & From addresses from the linked Etherscan transaction.  Optimism Alignment (< 200 words) Bankless Academy is a free-to-access, open-source, education hyper-structure seeking to empower internet society with the information and tools necessary to achieve financial self-sovereignty; with going Bankless. Our bDAO-native team is on a mission to provide quality web3 education as a free-for-everyone public good. With Optimism being a DAO that requires active participation to allocate value and build positive-sum structures, we believe that building a bridge between it and our growing Bankless Academy ecosystem will help to create an educated, sustainable and functional Optimism - and Ethereum - culture & economy. For the User:  Users can onboard to cheaper fees on Optimism L2. Users have a basis of understanding of Public Goods and why they\u2019re valuable. Users have an easy onboarding to what makes Optimism special \u2014 an explicit focus on public goods funded retroactively from the sequencer while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s core ideals of decentralization and security. Users have undergone proof of personhood (PoP), setting them up for Citizenship in Optimism.  For Optimism:  An Optimistic Ethereum L2 learning lesson. A Bankless-native onboarding funnel. Additional marketing within the Bankless ecosystem.  For Bankless Academy:  Development funding. Association with the Optimism ecosystem.   Token distribution (< 1000 words) Half of the tokens will be distributed to our contributors building the Ethereum Layer 2s (and Optimism) onboarding lesson. The other half will remain in the community treasury, to be deployed towards continued development of the Academy platform. We have presently decided to avoid lesson completion token incentives for the following reasons:   Even with current-gen proof-of-personhood, financial rewards disproportionately incentivise farming activity. We believe that our credential system poses a more interesting reward structure that inherently reduces farming behaviour and provides long-lasting ecosystem effects.   Our vision of a Web3 University is aimed at creating a space where learning and positive-sum thinking are welcome - thus we want to avoid building a community based on incentivising lesson completions for the wrong reasons. The Bankless Academy journey still has the potential to lead to financial gain, but this is left to post-education when users can deploy their credentials in finding web3 work.    How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  We have already presented our usage incentivisation above, and have no direct liquidity incentives to add.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  The Bankless Academy journey, through its education, credential issuance, and practical exercises, focuses on building long-term adoption and community involvement.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  There is no planned community token distribution.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  There is no planned community token distribution.

Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes/No/In Future Yes, our project is open source. Optimism native?: Yes/No No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: We are expecting to deliver our first Optimism lesson within two months of grant issuance. Should our proposal pass through cycle-6, this would set projected delivery for end of November 2022. Ecosystem Value Proposition:   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Optimism would benefit from an incentivised onboarding ramp that bolsters informed, active participation in its construction/upkeep of OP\u2019s positive-sum structures.   How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Education / Tooling: The Bankless Academy lesson format:  educates blockchain explorers on a specific topic, sends these explorers on an interactive platform quest, distributes composable soulbound-token badges for successful completions, providing on-chain certification that a user has completed the lesson.  Our user onboarding experience aims to guide users from Centralised Exchange through to becoming a DeFi/NFT/DAO Hero on Ethereum - building skills they can then take with them to other ecosystems should they choose. Our \u2018Essentials\u2019 onboarding journey includes:  \u201cGoing Bankless\u201d Wallet Basics Web3 Security Blockchain Basics Layer 1s: Ethereum and the Trilemma Layer 2s: Solving the Trilemma  We believe that by ending this \u2018Essentials\u2019 path with a lesson that shows users how to engage with Layer 2s (in this case, Optimism), Bankless Academy can drive a large number of users to:  begin using Optimism as their default Layer 2 DeFi & NFT solution, complete Ethereum proof of personhood, discover and consider joining Optimism\u2019s Citizen House, purchase OP tokens to engage in Optimism governance. flex their collection of Academy SBT credentials on the Optimism ecosystem, opening up an exciting range of possible ecosystem chemical reactions.  Following the completion of our \u2018Essentials\u2019 journey, users reach branching paths allowing them to explore their curiosity deep into topics of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more. This provides limitless options for additional lessons and exploration for platforms/protocols operation within the Optimism ecosystem. User Research: Our lesson production pipeline includes iterative learning sessions that can help to identify OP user knowledge bottlenecks, and discover suitable metaphors for explaining advanced concepts. Marketing + Brand Association: Throughout lesson production, the Optimism ecosystem will benefit from:  Multiple build announcements via Bankless Academy communication channels. Multiple tweets via @BanklessDAO to its ~59,000 followers. A BanklessDAO newsletter feature - 10,000 regular subscribers, averaging 13,000 views. Multiple announcements in BanklessDAO community calls.  OPTIONAL: Twitterspace + AMA with members of the Optimism team, talking specifically about Optimism as an L2 solution.    Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? . Through education, direct onboarding quests, proof of personhood, user research and marketing within the Bankless ecosystem, Bankless Academy has the ability to drive a large number of active and equipped users to use Optimism services - and even begin taking part in Optimism governance.   Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback. No Number of OP tokens requested: 33,000 OP (We use USD valuations to reward our contributors, even though they will be sent OP. This number has been updated from our past proposal to reflect a valuation of $30,000 at time of posting.) Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: Yes/No/In Process No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) Roughly 60% will be distributed to our contributors building and marketing the Ethereum Layer 2s (and Optimism) onboarding lesson. The other half will remain in the community treasury, to be deployed towards continued development of the Academy platform. We have presently decided to avoid lesson completion token incentives for the following reasons:  Even with current-gen proof-of-personhood, financial rewards disproportionately incentivise farming activity.

Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals. Distribution to contributors would take place according to our monthly distribution cycle that takes place on the 8th of every month.   Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. M1) Lesson production begins:  A consulting session, establishing lesson goals, content direction, and a timeline for the collaboration.  M2) Iterative Learning Sessions & build events:  3x 1.5 hour live learning sessions. Text AMA on our gm.xyz page (see our 1inch AMA here). Collaboration Twitterspaces event.  M3) Lesson launch:  Academy marketing campaign on Twitter and other media platforms. Announcement on the BanklessDAO Community Call. Announcement in the BanklessDAO Newsletter. Permanent feature on the Bankless Academy site and community pages.    Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?

                    "content": "Hi @jrocki.eth, great to see the Bankless movement is alive and well on Optimism. Thank you for your feedback, let\u2019s dive in.     jrocki.eth:  I agree with using the OP to fund internal developement work vs providing direct token incentives to users 100% at this point.   Excellent, reassuring to hear this from within the OP community.     jrocki.eth:  Would you be able to go into a little more detail as to the items you listed as direct benefits to Optimism? For example what would be involved in the OP specific lesson and would users actually be interacting with OP apps or just learning about them on screen? How would the Bankless-native onboarding funnel work in general? Once the user is at the end of this funnel what would they have interacted with or been exposed to within the OP ecosystem?   At Bankless Academy we are very focused on balancing wide coverage of general crypto-knowledge with the recommendation of tools that align strongly with Bankless values. Because of this we want to build our \u2018Essentials\u2019 lessons - lessons that are supposed to focus on introductory blockchain theory - to focus on general topic theory (in this case Layer 2s), but end with an on-chain quest that interacts with a specific protocol to give the user real-world experience. At this point in the user journey, the Academy Explorer has come from their native CEX, learned about what it means to go Bankless, set up their first self-custody wallet, covered fundamental blockchain theory, and has learned about the blockchain trilemma and why we want to prioritise decentralisation/security on the base layer. They are approaching our Layer 2 lesson expecting to understand how Ethereum is solving the scalability aspect outlined in the previous lesson, thus it is important that we cover fundamental theory before we try to sell them on a specific ethos/product. So with this context, to answer your question, we would cover Optimism itself in the final slides of the lesson (what OP offers the user/ecosystem, why we\u2019re sending the user there, and some tips on how to best get involved), and finish with an Optimism quest (perhaps funding their wallet through an OP on-ramp, or bridging from their CEX). Worth mentioning is that after the L2 lesson, the Explorer is ready to begin branching out into our DeFi, NFT, and DAO lesson branches (under construction), which of course would lead to the user interacting with further platforms/protocols and communities operating on OP. Our DAO branch aims to cover DAO-specific onboarding, where we could look to create a follow-up lesson, in the future, that allows the user to go beyond basic Optimism usage and delve into a full Optimism governance onboarding experience. We\u2019re currently building one of these for BanklessDAO, where they will be ending the lesson with issuance of an on-chain badge, and membership purchase options.     jrocki.eth:  Would the marketing be Bankless promoting OP specific lessons and learnings?   Here\u2019s what the Optimism community can expect:  3x small class iterative learning sessions where we cover the general topic and the collaborator\u2019s platform/protocol + all marketing this includes. Multiple build announcements via Bankless Academy communication channels. Multiple tweets via @BanklessDAO to its ~59,000 followers. A BanklessDAO newsletter feature - 10,000 regular subscribers, averaging 13,000 views. Multiple announcements in BanklessDAO community calls.  OPTIONAL: Twitterspace + AMA with members of the Optimism team, talking specifically about Optimism as an L2 solution.  NOTE: Bankless Academy was born out of BanklessDAO, so we do not have direct access to BanklessHQ\u2019s communication channels.  If the Optimism Collective is interested in joining us for a full collaboration build, like our current \u2018DEX Aggregators\u2019 lesson build with 1inch, the lesson build would receive heavily amplified marketing exposure. Lessons built with involvement from a well-known team tend to attract increased hype and legitimacy. This collaboration option requires the availability of an Optimism subject-matter expert who joins our team to:  interact with our learners in the 3x small class iterative learning sessions used to identify learning bottlenecks, join an Academy/Optimism Twitterspace, and text AMA event hosted on our gm.xyz community.  I hope this answers your questions! Please let me know if I can provide more information. ",

I would like to address the concern around Optimism exclusivity. Our Layer 2 lesson is planned to follow the same structure of our Layer 1 lesson, where we cover the many varieties of L1s before focusing in on Ethereum. In our L2 follow-up, the lesson would reference both Optimism and alternative L2 solutions for comparison sake in the theory section. We would outline the trade-offs each L2 is making through their tech choice, and include references to the culture/principles underlying each. The Optimism-focused section in the closing half then explains why we believe Optimism aligns most closely with Bankless values. We would cover some key information to provoke curiosity around the various parts of the Optimism ecosystem, and end with an Optimism on-chain quest that rewards the user for beginning their Optimism L2 journey. In our team\u2019s opinion, a lesson collaboration that covers fundamental blockchain theory and solution comparisons, followed by with an individual recommendation + information to get started + on-chain interaction makes for a stronger user experience than a fully sponsored lesson that omits surrounding information. We believe that helping the user build fundamental context around our recommendations and the areas of exploration we present builds a stronger and more sustainable ecosystem culture for everyone.

There were requests to detail planned marketing events, to which we have responded with a complete list of planned events. Our team has split its build approach into two parts, to account for collaboration availability for the Optimism Collective: 1 - Our team manages lesson production, handling marketing events entirely on our end. 2 (OPTIONAL) - We invite the Optimism Collective to assign a team member to be our L2 subject-matter specialist, joining our Iterative Learning Sessions to teach Academy users, identify their learning bottlenecks, and refine the lesson content. The subject-matter specialist is also invited to both a Twitterspace event and a text AMA event, focusing on the collaborator\u2019s story, L2 technology, and the lesson build process. While it appears that our proposal might be more suited for RPGF when available, we would like to request consideration as an edge-case proposal to begin building our collaboration lesson in the immediate future. We have responded to questions regarding internal distribution of requested funds, explaining that this grant would have ~50% allocated towards the lesson build (as contributor compensation), and ~50% allocated to the Bankless Academy treasury.

Would you be able to go into a little more detail as to the items you listed as direct benefits to Optimism?

Sharing our vision and roadmap with the community is something we\u2019re considering in our current website update, where we will be making our user journey, product and content roadmaps more concrete and transparent. Our infrastructure objectives for 2022 and 2023 are as follows:  Finalise our soul-bound badge implementation and minting mechanism. Finalise our Gitcoin Passport integration for sybil resistance. Build a statistics dashboard for monitoring lesson, quiz and quest progression. Present lessons with a branching navigation UI (think skilltrees from gaming) that provides users with an overview of their learning journey and the areas of exploration available to them. Gauge lesson interest for upcoming lessons and topics as an early form of community governance. Improve our content management system and migrating the content to decentralized file storage. Multi-language support to open up the Academy onboarding experience to explorers across the globe. Explore avenues of community-driven content creation (permissioned writing).  These are paralleled by our content goals:  Continue launching independent (non-sponsored) lessons focusing on theory, best practices, web3 culture etc. Increase user learning research and the refine our existing user journey.  I hope that the items I\u2019ve included here give you a clearer idea of where we\u2019re headed.   ",

                    "content": " 1. Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2. About the project  This project addresses perhaps one of the most important and neglected sectors of the ecosystem, education; it does it in a very clean, clear and precise way; inviting to a creative and entertaining experience, which motivates to continue learning in each new stage that is completed; also encouraging with tokens that define the level of learning, being perhaps, for many, the first interaction with them. Something important that I add, as a personal conclusion; is that Bankless Academy is a leg of Bankless DAO, the latter being very inserted the ecosystem, the content is created and goes directly to the consumer; we see many educational initiatives, where the generators \u201ctake\u201d the information from the web, order it and adapt it; Beyond the lack of quality that this generates, that the content is \u201cdirect\u201d is key in an industry so tied to changes.  3. About the following  The proposal was published from August 23 in a previous format (now called v1) then being adapted to a v2 with the current system. Under the process, we saw a very explanatory and detailed proposal; and we celebrate their active disposition to precise and fast answers with the delegates and community interested on it. As a Tooling committee, the project was also cataloged as \u201cTooling\u201d in the Grant category, we have decided to take the responsibility of issuing recommendations on it, while defining if proposals like these also oriented to education/content can be approached in another way with the current committees or not.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Education in Web3 and access to tools is currently a recurring problem on which it is easy to fall into the wrong methodology and ethos. Bankless has a reputable track record of addressing all of these topics on behalf of the community. The use of mintkudos is understood as a plus that the Optimism ecosystem may be interested in trying and taking note of.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): high. this aspect can have an unlimited impact, or better said, not directly tied to the grant - being an educational initiative, it reaches a range of interested parties that are not included in the average of the proposals that are normally addressed - This project is of use for free and with almost zero entry barrier (prior knowledge). Its impact is clearly dependent on how many users it can reach and high expertise, managing high attendance.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): in development. The project is open source and free; some content specific to Optimism will be built or improved in the process.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): appropriate. The incentive must be where the value is, and in this case the value is in the construction and future development, such as contributors. A portion will go to the community treasury, which means that ~13,200 tokens will be independently managed by this initiative.  Amount requested (high to low): medium. Amount requested seems reasonable for the team members in the stipulated period.   5. KPIs and impact tracking As detailed in the proposal, a series of activities are contemplated that we will be happy to find out when they take place, please communicate in time with focus to the Optimism community any event that has been possible thanks to the approval of this proposal. In details, we ask Bankless Academy responsibles to provide statistics on at least the following aspects:  How many users started at least one of the materials releated to Optimism How many users finished the different modules Attendance at scheduled events Relevant experiences in the process, proof-of-personhood, use of mintkudos and others relevant to Optimism and its ecosystem.   6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes ",

We\u2019ve launched a new micro-lesson format (Mirror articles embedded in the Academy app) to allow us to swiftly plug user journey gaps like this one. In this case, the first article focuses on three ways to fund a wallet on Layer 2 (using Optimism as the example). By including this in the user journey as prerequisite content (rather than inside the L2 lesson), we can maintain the L2 lesson focus on tech, benefits, and the Optimism ecosystem without having to dilute with explanations of wallet/funding UX.  twitter.com    Bankless Academy \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 @BanklessAcademy  Introducing THE EXPLORER'S HANDBOOK \ud83d\udcd8 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80  A series of collectible articles to serve your #Bankless journey on the go.

After this review is complete, the writers will perform edits, and the content will be passed to the illustrators. Quest development and marketing preparations begin next week - @lavande I\u2019m interested to know if there is availability for social media support by the Optimism Collective to boost engagement on launch? This will result in more people completing the Optimism onboarding quest and collecting their Academy soulbound badge. Speaking of, we just passed 2100 badges minted since our badge launch in October (reminder: these badges are protected by Gitcoin Passport, meaning they\u2019re highly sybil resistant). We\u2019re very happy to be receiving so much app activity during a bear market - it will be interesting to monitor these figures as we release more content and hit the next bull market and as various ecosystems build out utility for these badges   image1666\u00d7752 25.7 KB  We\u2019re currently projecting the lesson release and launch campaign for the first week of February. Thank you for your patience with the build process. We\u2019re excited to release this lesson - the last entry to our essentials curriculum - and get Academy user exploring the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem early next month! PS: We\u2019re also looking for a tech/culture expert @ Optimism to review the lesson content in the coming weeks. Does anyone have a recommendation/interest themselves? @katie @mastermojo @polynya ",

Could you please provide more information about the direct benefits of Optimism that you listed? For example, what topics will be covered in a specific OP lesson and will users have the opportunity to interact with OP applications or just learn about them through screen-based instruction? Additionally, can you explain how the Bankless-native onboarding process will work as a whole and what the user will be introduced to in the OP ecosystem at the end of that process? Lastly, will the marketing strategy be Bankless-native and focus on promoting specific OP lessons and knowledge? ",
