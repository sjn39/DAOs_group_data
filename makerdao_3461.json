                    "content": "I\u2019ve been working on a basic discounted cash flow model to provide a high level estimate of MKR\u2019s value and wanted to share it with the community \u2013 both to receive feedback and improve the model, but also to provide a lens into valuation for newer and less experienced investors. Shoutout to @Sebventures for providing valuable feedback and advice. Anyone who\u2019s been in the crypto community for more than a few years understands the immense amount of sh!tcoins out there with questionable use-cases and poor/obfuscated tokenomics. As we know, MKR is different \u2013 the value proposition and use-case is clear, fundamentals continue to improve, and the tokenomics are strong. In this model there are several key inputs which drive the \u2018fair\u2019 value of MKR, all quite subjective this early in Maker\u2019s growth. The discount rate and interest spread (difference between the long term interest rate on risk weighted assets and the DSR) are the two most important inputs. For most venture capital investments, a discount rate between 30-70% is often used. Typically the earlier one is in the investment cycle, the higher the discount rate used. If Maker was a traditional company, the discount rate would be lower, but in crypto there are unique risks \u2013 smart contract, legal/regulatory, central to decentralization, etc. Therefore, a higher discount rate was chosen both in the short/medium term and for terminal value calculations. Regarding the interest spread, the ~5.5% rates we enjoy today will likely decrease over time as discussed in Seb\u2019s Crypto Banking 101 post Research Paper - Crypto Banking 101.  A 2% rate was chosen to be conservative though rates could stay elevated in the near term. Other key inputs include: YoY growth, Net Margin, and P/E Multiple. I\u2019d encourage anyone interested in the model to adjust the inputs and enter their own assumptions to see how that changes the present value.   docs.google.com    MKR Valuation 4.11.21.xlsx MKR   Maker (MKR) Valuation Model as of 4/11/21 Undiscounted,Sensitivity Analysis Year,Year End DAI Outstanding ($MM),Avg DAI Outstanding ($MM),Net Income ($MM),Discounted Net Income ($MM),Net Profit Margin,MKR Price based on...

I have been making some DCF models for Maker in the past so I\u2019ll make few suggestions:  rate spread and discount rate seem fine to me and I\u2019d rather put more effort in simulating growth and breakdown of net margin. linear growth seems a bit high to me (doubling each year), considering debt growth is still likely to be related to crypto market cycles (until RWA have larger share) and we are probably late in the current cycle. Simulations for growth as you have for spread and discount rate wouldn\u2019t hurt here. using fixed net margin seems too simplified, I\u2019d imagine part of costs at Maker are going to be less related to growth than others. But it also isn\u2019t an easy job to address this. 30% of revenues that cover future losses, workforce (budgets + vesting), oracles could seem a bit too low, at least early on? I think recent budget simulations showed that 30% or more could be spent only by workforce and MKR vesting according to recent proposals? I am missing liquidation penalties, are they part of rate spread? If so, spread is probably too low then. I am also missing expected losses, but you could say that you simply covered them with liquidation penalties that you omitted? If so, these assumptions would probably need to be mentioned. finally the big unknown, 10% of MKR held by foundation. We don\u2019t know what happens with it, but I imagine it has a positive effect on your simulation either way.  ",

It\u2019s column K. Must also say that we are saying we are late in the crypto cycle for months now (which I still believe). In 2030, it\u2019s $0.5T of deposit, this is less than half of Citigroup or Wells Fargo. A bit above Capital one which is quite recent (26 y.o.).     Primoz:  30% of revenues that cover future losses, workforce (budgets + vesting), oracles could seem a bit too low, at least early on? I think recent budget simulations showed that 30% or more could be spent only by workforce and MKR vesting according to recent proposals?   That\u2019s a decision for MKR holders. I\u2019m a big fan of targeting expenses using a normalized metric of net revenues. 30% on a $247M fee-base should make sense. I also want to highlight that to keep DAI protection the same, we need to allocate a significant portion of the revenues when growth is significant. To avoid losing protection we need at least 40% of the SF to be used for that (limiting workforce expenses at 60% top, otherwise there is MKR holder dilution). I\u2019m on the side that you can\u2019t issue half a trillion stablecoins without having a bit of regulation or at least appears safe to customers using regulatory standards. To reach 3.5% of leverage ratio, we need to allocate 70% of the net revenues to achieve it at the end of the decade.  image1003\u00d7605 31.6 KB  With $MKR at 2k currently, there is a lot of price appreciation over the decade. It shows it\u2019s possible. Not easy but possible. It\u2019s an early model, it will be refined. But it shows that even the current price level magnitude depends on serious growth. We need to be focussed and dedicated on growth which is a bit my discussion about the business strategy (that currently we don\u2019t really have). Correcting some stuff, I found a current fair MKR price of 3.4k if we target 50% workforce expenses and 4.8k if we target a 70% workforce expenses. PS: Regarding the excellent work, @Aes will be on the RWF Core Unit budget to continue improving the model (among other stuffs). ",

Just wanted to highlight that these recent Core Unit proposals (incl. upcoming ones with MKR vesting) might have an impact on it and we need to be aware of it. One other angle of valuing MKR is that MKR value is not solely derived from cashflows but also retains governance value. In other words, you have MKR token holders who are interested in keeping DeFi secure and scalable through DAI because they have wider benefits in DeFi. So even if MKR was yielding 0, it would still have positive value for these reasons. I think Coincenter had also one interesting \u201cgovernance based token valuation\u201d where it basically looks at the value governance token secures and then calculates token\u2019s value through this bounty. So in MKR\u2019s case it kind of serves as a floor value at 0 cashflow I think. ",

I\u2019ve chosen not to model these cycles and smooth them out for simplicity though it is something certainly worth discussing.

Obviously all DCF models require a leap of faith when the majority of the value comes from the end years. One place I would push back is your discount rate of 40%. I understand this has become a standard discount rate among crypto analysts but it does not seem grounded in anything. If you believe that MKR is a venture style asset and venture capital has averaged a return of ~27%/yr for the past 30 years then 27% should be a starting top line discount rate. Unlike venture capital MKR is a liquid asset so it gets a liquidity premium over non liquid venture assets. Liquidity can be considered as an option. Researchers like Ibbotson have found this premium to be worth about 4% a year. So, 27% - 4% = 23%. One more thing to consider is that over the past 30 years the risk free rate was closer to 4.5%, today it\u2019s 1.5%, so if you adjust the venture base risk premium by 3% it\u2019s 24%. 24% - 4% = 20%, So 20% seems like a more realistic discount rate in today\u2019s environment.    observablehq.com \u2013 6 Oct 18    MakerDAO (MKR) Stability fee utility value exploration The theory behind this notebook is that the dividend discount model can be applied to the portions of token models that burn tokens as can be found the governance fee mechanics outlined in the MakerDAO whitepaper Disclaimer: We simply don't have...

This is a real risk, which is mitigated by two main factors at the moment. First, partnership with 3rd party ecosystems that assist the protocol doing business in a compliant matter with existing regulations, including AML/KYC and money transmission requirements. One partner here is Centrifuge which assists its asset originators in creating debt structures within the boundaries of what is permitted by each jurisdiction. The second factor, still under R&D, is the use of the PSM USDC for lending. USDC has been built to operate within the boundaries of regulatory environments with regulated entities. In theory, the protocol can provide lending facilities by deploying the USDC in the PSM to rwa AOs should they require it either by law or by necessity (volatility of DAI). But again, this use is under review at this stage. ",
