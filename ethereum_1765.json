Instead, an authorized operator will have to do the transfers. The reason for this is that the token receiver needs to be KYC\u2019d. My questions are:  Do you have any thoughts on other ideas of how to get around this KYC issue? Should we propose a standard for real estate that works in this way? How should I get started with drafting the spec? Just start reading the docs and writing?  ",

I took a quick peek at coindation. We know we have a ton of similar use cases to real world assets (because, ya know, ours is a real world asset).  I\u2019d love to understand your use case. Does ERC-721 fit the RWA use case? Does coindation need some ultimate control to determine who owns the token? Thanks for the post! ",

Ultimately, our vision is to make it so that owners have the option to sell the property in a traditional real estate transaction. The value of the property should be limited to the crypto market, ya know? Perhaps, this includes the right to take title to the property given that you pass KYC and there is no lien?  It\u2019s a really good potential solution though. I dropped the idea to the team. It\u2019s something we could certainly experiment with. ",

The simplest  is probably a REIT DAO I know that you can\u2019t have stocks tied to crypto yet but I assume there\u2019s some way to do it through an equity dao where the company buys stocks and you can buy the company\u2019s governance/ownership coin which they repurchase with profits and the governors decide what % goes to repurchase and what % goes to buying more property. For individual rental properties you could just have NFT\u2019s that represent each property and your own coin that people receive instead of rent that they can use to purchase more NFT property off you. As for buying/selling it\u2019s not exclusive as it\u2019s an erc-20 token that\u2019ll end up on defi exchanges. I\u2019m not offering an one size fits all solution you\u2019d have to figure out what works best for your corporation given the legal laws in your country of operation. That being said being able to avoid KYC is a huge benefit of owning everything through a corporation and I\u2019d suggest giving up on direct property ownership. Being able to buy/sell property with no tax instantly is the golden goose. I can instantly sell my summer house in Canada for a winter house in Arizona  ",
