                    "content": " Quick Lending Market Update tl;dr  The lending market across the board has been risking off in May This has led to a drop of $34.9M of annualized interest revenue since the first of May, from $66.4M to $31.5M Maker has mostly maintained market share    This analysis covers Maker, Liquity, AAVE v2, and COMP v2 on ETH L1. Data is as of 5/31/22. Outstanding debt (against volatile crypto assets) at Maker has been in decline since November but experienced a sharp decline in May:  image1220\u00d7792 62.7 KB  The same drop can be seen in other major lending protocols:  image1436\u00d71080 158 KB  As shown below, Maker has maintained market share throughout this dip in May:  image1614\u00d71136 145 KB  Most of this risking off comes from the largest customers, industry wide:  image1668\u00d71002 151 KB  On May 16th, rates on WBTC-A and WBTC-B vaults were lowered by 100bps and 50 bps respectively, which is clearly seen on the below chart. Risk off has been disproportionately in our higher-rate vaults, slowly lowering our blended average interest rate:  image1230\u00d7784 55.5 KB  These WBTC rate decreases were made in response to decreasing share in this market since November, easily visible on the following chart of total stablecoins borrowed against WBTC:  image1366\u00d7864 114 KB  Thus far, it is inconsclusive whether this change will lead to a substantial gain in WBTC market share. Below is a zoomed in view of Maker\u2019s WBTC market share since 4/1/22 with some relevant dates overlaid. Interestingly enough, it seems that the market has not yet reacted much to liquidity mining in AAVE v2 ending, suggesting the market might be slow to act:  image1382\u00d7720 114 KB  The general stablecoin borrowing market has been seeing declining rates in recent months as well. For instance, here is the (unsubsidized) borrow rate of USDC on Compound declining from 3.59% to 2.2% since March 29:  image2060\u00d71080 139 KB  Similarly, here is the (unsubsidized) USDC borrow rate on AAVE v2 declining from 3.11% to 2.18% since April 16:  image1178\u00d7886 69 KB    These two effects, lower outstanding loans & lower rates, have led to a sharp ~53% drop of annualized interest revenue since the first of the month, from $66.4M to $31.5M (-$34.9M):  image1238\u00d7790 68 KB  Conclusion  The lending market all around has been suffering and Maker is not immune. Maker vault annualized interest revenues have dropped $34.9M since the first of May, from $66.4M to $31.5M Maker has maintained market share on stablecoin borrows fairly well despite losing share in borrows against WBTC between November and early May Thus far, it is inconclusive whether lowering borrowing rates will lead to a significant increase in demand / market share of our WBTC vaults  Appendix  image1658\u00d71018 176 KB  Maker borrow (against volatile crypto-assets) by borrow amount  image1856\u00d7330 34.4 KB  Liquity borrow by borrow amount  image1856\u00d7422 36.1 KB  AAVE v2 net stablecoin borrow by borrow amount  image1856\u00d7422 98.5 KB  COMP v2 net stablecoin borrow by borrow amount  image1856\u00d7466 87.4 KB  ",
