In addition to these deployments, there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony, Celo, and more chains expected soon. The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets, but as the protocol continues to grow, it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments. With each new chain, there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments.\n\nGFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap cross-chain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains.\n\nPolygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the [Fx-Portal](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/). The portal functions via three contracts: FxRoot, State Sender, & FxChild. Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChild(address, bytes) at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum, which calls the State Sender contract. The [validators](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator/) monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon. Upon successful relay to the FxChild, the message is executed on Polygon by the validators.\n\nThe owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the [Ethereum Proxy contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#code).
