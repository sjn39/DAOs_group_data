Would appreciate any code pointers! Also open to philosophical feedback as to whether this is a good vault. I like it because the vault is not less secure than a standard 2/3 multisig as long as T is extended frequently. And if the owner loses 2 keys, they can recover the vault after T as long as nobody else knows any of the keys. ",

This gets cleared when a new time delay for that key is set. New keys can be added and old ones removed with a 2/3 supermajority (rounded down) Keys can remove themselves  ",
