                    "content": "Overview New Silver has been working with MakerDAO for close to 2 years to bring what we believe are high quality, real estate collateralized short term bridge loans to the community. In partnership with Centrifuge, we brought the first real world asset loan on-chain in April of this year, and are coming close to using up the 5mm DAI debt ceiling initially set by the community. The initial 5M from Maker in combination with additional external DROP and TIN investors allowed us to finance 39 assets with an average financing fee of 6.8%, average loan amount of 216642 DAI and average maturity of 12.2 months. 1 asset has been repaid and no defaults occured to date. It has been a learning experience for us and we worked hard to improve and ensure the community of our intention to make this a lasting and worthy partnership. We brought on an independent manager (https://citadelspv.com) and strengthened the SPV operating agreement to provide bankruptcy remoteness and strong protection for the DAO (see relevant links [1] and [2]). At this time, we would like to ask the community to approve an increase in debt ceiling and to bring some of the underwriting metrics in-line with current process and market conditions. This will enable further diversification across more borrowers and loans, and provide the DAO with a stable, high-yielding asset collateral that can continue to grow. Therefore, New Silver is asking to increase the debt ceiling from 5M to 20M Pros  This allows New Silver to sustainably grow its Tinlake pool and with that increase diversification across the pool It also allows New Silver to offer a competitive product and attract top-tier borrowers It allows Maker to increase exposure to uncorrelated collateral assets through a vetted partner with limited governance overhead It will send a strong message to RWA in DeFi and underpin Maker\u2019s position in the market  Cons  Increased exposure to real estate asset class     Should MakerDAO increase the debt ceiling of RWA-02 (NS-DROP) from 5M to 20M  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next steps The poll will run until July 8, 4:00 PM UTC ; this will result in on-chain-polls assuming the outcome of the poll is affirmative ",

The smart contract code (Maker integration) now has an audit (but not an expert here). The legal audit is underway but nothing seems too obvious.

No, but I don\u2019t think \u201call\u201d is a very good standard. This whole time I have just been weighing the risk of moving forward versus the risk of standing still, and I think that (structurally speaking) the risk of moving forward is now less than the risk of standing still. As @PaperImperium pointed out, there seems to be a real willingness to continually improve the structures moving forward, which I really respect. My previous concerns were mainly based around the short-term preservation of capital, and these have been addressed. I think we can figure out the medium/long term capital preservation issues as we go. That being said I do have a couple of questions for @prankstr25 that pertain to concerns outside of the structure itself:   Can you give us some clarity into your security practices when transferring Dai from the Vault (or Tinlake) and back? I worry that without a strict protocol in place, Maker could instantaneously lose its principal due to a hack or human error.   Once the debt ceiling is increased, how will you treat the diversification covenants that you agreed to with the RWF Team? Will you meet them at the debt ceiling level (i.e. out of $20M) or will you meet them continuously or somewhere in-between?   Thanks in advance and looking forward to watching your business grow with MakerDAO. PS - I\u2019m very far from being an expert on this stuff. EDIT: Just to note, on question (1), I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m trying to disqualify reasonable practices. Personally, I think that so long as you\u2019re not drawing more than one loan\u2019s worth of Dai at a time from the Vault, you don\u2019t really need a rock-solid security setup. ",

I can\u2019t comment on Kirill\u2019s process today though I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll share more details. But one thing that Centrifuge is doing to improve here: we are building a specialized smart contract wallet that allows withdrawals to a limited set of addresses with single user confirmations. Adding of new withdrawal addresses would then require more than one confirmation. This is a reasonable trade-off as it would allow the day to day be managed by a single user without risking loss of funds. Hopefully we can roll this out in the coming months. ",

To answer your questions:  I have been thinking about this as well. Presently, I am the only person that conducts transactions (have been in crypto since around 2013, more active in 2017) and take great care to ensure no errors are made. I use a hardware wallet which has compartmentalized seed phrase backup and all of the security features enabled. We then use a third party exchange to trade DAI to USD. This process is a bit laborious right now because of the manual processes involved in creating the NFT collateral, but we are working on tighter integration with Tinlake so hopefully this will be resolved, leaving less room for human error. We plan on continuously discussing the covenants with the RWF Team and meeting or asking for adjustments if necessary. For example, the current covenant of 30% per state may not be the most appropriate if we think about large states like Florida - obviously Miami is one market, and Tampa is totally different, same with West Palm Beach, etc. The same can often be said about larger states like NY, NJ, etc.  ",

Some of these constraints were not surfaced earlier due to the newness of RWA within Maker, such as LTV/LTC/ARV vs simply LTV, and that will be addressed going forward. Also, compared to a traditional financing relationship, it is clear that New Silver views Maker as a partner and will continue to improve the relationship in an ongoing and diligent manner.

                    "content": "I\u2019d recommend pulling the on-chain poll forward a week in this instance. I understand that New Silver would like to see this resolved as quickly as possible. I\u2019m happy to support changing the end-date to 2021-07-08 in this instance for the following reasons:  Solid amount of participation in the signal poll so far. Very few \u2018No\u2019 votes in an absolute sense. Solid \u2018yes\u2019 vote relative to \u2018no\u2019 vote, even considering votes from newer accounts. Discussion has been both respectful and generally positive from all involved. Relevant parties have commented (author, core unit personnel, centrifuge people, RWA co.)  @prankstr25 if you agree, please respond and make the change to the initial forum post to reflect the updated timeline.
