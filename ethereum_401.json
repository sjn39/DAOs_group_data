Just thought that it would be helpful to bring everyone up to date with the effort on ERC1066, especially since a lot has happened since Berlin! (Feedback appreciated on format. I\u2019m not totally certain that this is the correct place to post updates versus just in the intro thread)  Focused Effort   @boris and I got some breathing room to focus on ESCs through the Consensys Tachyon Accelerator open source track. We also have committed effort from Robot Overlord (which is also me ) through at least the end of the year. The current team is three: @expede & @jenncoop focused on tech, and @boris on community.  720\u00d7652 90.8 KB   In the Wild   ERC1400 \u2014 Security Tokens uses ESCs as part of the standard. We\u2019re going to be chatting with them about possibly integrating their use cases (on an abstraction of it) directly into the standard.  Use Case Research   Protocols are essentially abstractions over common use cases. We\u2019re doing a bunch of R&D around filling in the currently empty ranges in appropriate, flexible, reusable ways. If anyone wants to send us their use case, and especially contract architectures, we\u2019d love to get that into the standard and make contracts more clearer and more interoperable.  Translations   This is a very compelling use case of ESCs, and part of the original vision. The architecture and interfaces may be worth splitting out into a derivative standard, just to keep the core ERC-1066 focused. It\u2019s still a design goal of the core ESC project, and the helper libs will almost certainly include translations support.  Tool Integration   We\u2019re talking to a bunch of wallets, frameworks, libs, and profilers to see if there\u2019s a fit. Also to collect use cases from those projects\u2019 goals   More Places to Talk!  ESC Channel on the SPADE Discord Community calls starting up again\u2026 soon   ",
