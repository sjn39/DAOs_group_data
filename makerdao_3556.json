Wintec originates and administers the asset collateralization using Centrifuge\u2019s model and Tinlake protocol. NAOS Finance funds the TIN tranche from its liquidity pool.  1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Wintec, the asset originator, is represented by:  David Jeng, CEO of Wintec, [email\u00a0protected] @DavidJeng   Centrifuge will provide the technology and the framework for bringing RWA to MCD. The main contact from the Centrifuge team will be Lea Schmitt @_LS and Martin Quensel @martin NAOS Finance serves as both a TIN investor and an asset manager bringing other TIN investors into the pool, and is represented by:  Kevin Tseng, Operations at NAOS Finance, [email\u00a0protected]    2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Wintec is seeking a long-term strategic partnership with MakerDao to build a substantial and diversified real world asset portfolio with fixed maturity contracts and in this case, income streams from fixed supply chain contracts. We are working closely with Will Remor @williamr (Due Diligence at MakerDAO) to help scale the RWA onboarding process with MakerDAO Wintec is a supply chain company in the semiconductor industry with a track record of funding supply chain finance assets: accounts receivable and inventory. It is a supply chain services company that currently services OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) in the electronics and semiconductor industry. It currently supports the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars of goods (primarily electronics) through their supply chain and are audited by customers from the Fortune 500 and their books are audited by a top 10 accounting firm (These will be disclosed with the RWF Core Unit during due diligence). It has been in operation for 30 years, and in the supply chain management business for 15 years and experienced 0% default within their supply chain management business. The company has contracts with OEMs as a supply chain servicing agent and works with OEM-directed spend. It sits in between the suppliers and EMS (Electronics manufacturing services)/contract manufacturers within an authorized ecosystem. It not only helps with supply chain financing, but also moves the goods and is partner EDI/API-enabled wherever possible.  Flow of goods1056\u00d7351 11.5 KB  Unified planning as provided by Wintec to the OEM/end-customer provides benefits like:   Less manufacturing downtime   Less excess inventories   Less inventory holding fees   The supply chain finance is backed by 3 things:   Accounts receivable - once inventory is sold to EMS/contract manufacturer within authorized ecosystem   Inventories \u2013 electronics and components that are required to build technology systems, which are sold to the EMSs/contract manufacturers   Contract governing the business model are guaranteed by the OEM   Wintec is able to provide working capital financing in the supply chain, with an extremely high degree of confidence to collect in full, as demonstrated in the workflow below. The workflow below reflects a general inventory purchase, throughout the duration of a contract, with 2 additional considerations:   Inventory purchasing could be one-time or numerous times during the contract. The timing of the workflow below is more reflective of a one-time inventory purchase (but the steps are roughly the same), and there will be ebbs and flows in the mix of accounts receivable and inventory in the lifetime of the contract. For example, for a one-time purchase, inventory financing is high at the beginning, and decreases over time as the contract manufacturers consume and pay it off every month.   Because there are contracts with several EMSs, there are several purchase orders in play at any one time.    Workflow1173\u00d7588 35.2 KB  Wintec and NAOS Finance will conduct a thorough underwriting process, including risk assessment of the following areas:     Type of asset Type of risk Data to be reviewed/Potential mitigants     Accounts receivable Credit (elaborated below) Top 15 global EMS/contract manufacturers have mostly investment grade credit ratings, full range is from AA- to B-.   Geography EMS/contract manufacturers are based on major global manufacturing countries    Operational Contractual protections or contractual obligation to be consumed by OEM or customers    Inventory Demand, Pricing Contractual obligation to be consumed by OEM or customers   Physical Warehouse/marine cargo insurance, and housed in authorized and secured warehouses    Legal Contractual passthrough product indemnities and warranties in accordance with existing agreements    General Execution Historical performance, customized internal system controls, weekly touchpoints with OEM and other supply chain partners, E&O insurance   Financial Contractual structures, exit clause requires OEM to fully consume in event of Company default     The counterparties from the credit risk assessment point of view are the OEM and the contract manufacturers. The OEM guarantees the consumption of the inventories and will be a company within the Fortune 500. The contract manufacturer manufactures for the OEM. and the manufacturer will be a company within the top 15 of global EMSs. Wintec assesses these risks accordingly.     Type of asset Credit risk of counterparty     Accounts Receivable Top 15 EMSs (mostly investment grade credit ratings, full range is from AA- to B-)   Inventory Fortune 500   Contractual Fortune 500    This collateral application uses the Centrifuge model and proposes the DROP token [PA-DROP] of Wintec\u2019s asset pool as collateral. A detailed overview of Centrifuge\u2019s technology stack can be found here. Legal Setup Wintec will create an SPV in Delaware which will be independently run to ensure risk exposure only to the supply chain company as well as bankruptcy remoteness (via 3rd party director or other methods determined with Legal Counsel) to protect debt holders. Wintec is the asset originator. The SPV will own the contract with the OEM (counterparty is the OEM). The SPV will enter into an agreement with the supply chain company for supply chain operations. The SPV will enter into a service agreement with Centrifuge to get support from Centrifuge while using Centrifuge\u2019s open and decentralized infrastructure. The SPV will tokenize the underlying supply chain finance assets (a mix of accounts receivable and inventory) into NFTs and will add those NFTs to Tinlake as collateral. The SPV will utilize Tinlake to issue PA-DROP and PA-TIN backed by the pool of NFTs that are locked in Tinlake. NAOS Finance will purchase the PA-TIN tokens. Find the documentation for the two-tranche structure here.  3. Provide a brief history of the project About Wintec Wintec Industries, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of DRAM memory modules, Flash memory products, embedded modems and a value-added supplier of computer products and wireless peripherals. Wintec offers an extensive line of high-quality and leading-edge-technology memory modules and customized memory solutions for telecom, networking, computing, gaming, industrial and medical applications. Wintec is now partnering with Centrifuge to explore funding RWA with DAI through MakerDAO. About Centrifuge Centrifuge provides the infrastructure to allow transparent and secure onboarding of RWAs to MCD. New Silver was the first asset originator to back DAI with RWA using the Centrifuge model. Wintec is one of many projects currently in the pipeline to help MakerDAO scale RWA backing to $300M by the end of 2021. About NAOS Finance NAOS Finance is a DeFi lending protocol allowing lenders and corporate borrowers to facilitate permissionless and borderless loaning/borrowing transactions on the blockchain. For this application, NAOs is both an investor into TIN and also an asset manager bringing other TIN investors into the pool.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Wintec\u2019s mainnet deployment will be accessible via tinlake.centrifuge.io Technical documentation about Tinlake can be found here: https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake and the Maker specific implementation here: https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake-maker-lib   5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Centrifuge has conducted several audits of its technology stack. The audits can be found here.  6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Centrifuge Discourse Forum  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? The SPV will be financed by issuing DROP Tokens for 85% of the net asset value of the pool of NFTs plus cash on hand (collectively \u201cPool Valuation\u201d) and TIN Tokens for 15% of the Pool Valuation. Wintec will initially seek 20 million DAI from MakerDAO, increasing to 50-100 million over the next 6-12 months. Wintec expects to use the funds to fund a smaller supply chain finance contract within the above-mentioned supply chain finance partner: a mix of accounts receivables and inventory. The tenure depends on the life of the contract, usually 1-5 years. This will be for either an inventory purchase & depletion model where there is a one-time purchase of inventory then depletion, about one turn per year of inventory or a slower turning inventory depletion model where there are multiple purchases for depletion, about 2-3 turns per year. The Issuer will repay the outstanding balance drawn against the supply chain finance NFT and accrued interest as it receives payment. All of supply chain finance within a contract will have similar risk characteristics including a high-quality OEM partner, OEM-approved ecosystem of suppliers and contract manufacturers, with the above-mentioned risk mitigants. The supply chain partner has a proven long term track record in supply chain financing, having been in operation for 30+ years and has funded $6bn+ over the past 15 years. If everything goes smoothly, the Issuer will add more supply chain contracts of similar quality. For example, for its much larger deals, the supply chain partner is able to obtain bank financing at under 2% for 85% of the financing needs, and will look to fund the mezzanine balance of 15% through this structure later and eventually remove traditional bank financing from the picture and ask MakerDAO for a lower stability fee as its replacement. For now, Wintec will seek a slightly higher Stability Fee from MakerDAO than bank rates because 1) MakerDao is taking part in the mezzanine level debt. Other details:   Supply chain contract: Encompasses any and all purchase orders during the life of the contract   Tenure: Depends on life of contract. Blend of accounts receivables (usually 30-60 days), inventory (usually 180-360 day terms with rights to extend), that varies across time within contract period (depletion versus ongoing)   Advance rate targets for both accounts receivables and inventory: 100%   Historic Default Rate: 0%   Deal/tranche details: DROP (Senior) 85% - MakerDao 75%, other DROP investors 25%, TIN (Junior) - 15% - variable apr    8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? The SPV acts as a third party in which they would own the contract and collateral on behalf of the OEM, Wintec and MakerDAO. OEM guarantees contract consumption, and the supply chain company operates the contract to ensure compliance. There will be a party that oversees this SPV in order to receive instructions in case of default or other liquidation activities.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The SPV enters into a subscription agreement with lenders who receive DROP from the SPV in turn for providing DAI. The DROP token can be redeemed against the cash flows of the underlying collateral directly from the SPV by any DROP holder. This is ensured by the Tinlake smart contracts and the primary way for interacting with these tokens.  10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. TBD  11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. The issuance of DROP and TIN tokens is handled via Securitize, with AML/KYC procedures and compliance with US securities guidelines. Investors based in the US must be accredited investors (generally defined as having a net worth of at least $1 million). The SPV issues DROP tokens for the Maker vault, and Centrifuge will post legal discussion about potential implications for Maker.  12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. We intend to use the same iterative approach the Oracle Domain Team proposed for the New Silver collateral onboarding. Cadence and extent of reporting will be defined with the RWF Core Unit and the Oracle Domain team. The supply chain company is regularly audited by a third party and audit data can be shared with the RWF team.  13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. TBD ",

In traditional financing, negotiating points for investors would be to demand the asset originator only place A/R in the pool in which the A/R debtor is of a certain grade, demand that no more than X% of the total pool be related to A/R debtors below a certain credit rating or unrated, or demand that A/R related to an A/R debtor below a certain investment grade can only obtain some percentage less of a loan against it.  If the pool is mostly BBB and above with a set small percentage to possibly be below that, then 85/15 makes some sense.  If not the Tin portion should be much greater to reflect how risky this investment is.  Any thoughts?  Also, is the thought that both A/R and inventory financing would be part of the same pool, and if so what percentages of each?  A/R has much quicker turnaround and thus less risk than inventory and is also easier to value ($100 owed a month ago is still $100 owed today, whereas a semiconductor part in inventory can become near worthless) and thus that too factors into whether an 85/15 split is appropriate. Accredited investors in U.S. - have you prepared a private placement memorandum for such investors?  Would you share it? I have other questions on the structure and ability to liquidate (FYI 20 years U.S. commercial creditor rights\u2019 attorney) but I am first completing reading through the Centrifuge memos, prior proposals, and at least one of the YouTube archive videos regarding the structure.

And yes, they are mostly BBB and above. For the proportion of A/R and inventory financing, it varies over time based on the contract. For a debt ceiling of 20 million DAI (in discussions with the RWF core team), it would be one of the smaller contracts which is either a one turn of inventory per year or 2-3 turns. For the former, it will start with all inventory, then as the contract manufacturer draws down on the inventory, it becomes A/R. The chart below should be a good visual representation, and the 2-3 turns will have more inventory spikes depending on when the inventory turns happen in the year.  one time inventory474\u00d7826 5.12 KB   Yes in general inventory is riskier than A/R but the OEM is ultimately contractually obligated to consume. If the quality or freshness of the product is not up to par, there are return rights and aging limits. For the 85/15 split, we will discuss with the RWF core team, and it is ultimately up to the team to decide. For the accredited investors in the US, there are some templates to subscription documents at the bottom of this link. Securitize is taking care of the accreditation of US investors and we will have specific legal documents which can be shared at a later point. Hope that helps and thanks for the questions! ",

On top of the reasons you mentioned above, I think of these others:  More access: Doesn\u2019t apply for this supply chain partner, but NAOS has many relationships with SMEs where it has been traditionally more difficult to get bank financing. And that is where financing truly make a difference: it could mean the SME surviving or not. Transparency in risk assessment: This has been traditionally a very opaque process which is tightly held in-house at traditional banks and financial institutions. We like the process here! Scale Diversification of funding: Always a good thing for borrowers. Rates: This is probably not right now, but DAI (and others) can be great alternatives to traditional bank financing at some point in the future in terms of lower rates to borrowers.  ",

If you have an updated link so others can view please post.  And I appreciate your explanation. I would caution the decision makers that inventory financing of semiconductor inventory is one of the riskier inventories to finance because of obsolescence.  I\u2019m pretty confident that there are no buyers for the chips in my 2 year old phone if that was what was repossessed.  I understand the comment about the OEM being contractually obligated to consume but that is a risk the same as that account debtors are obligated to pay their A/R balance.   I would also caution if there is no restriction on how much A/R related to non-rated or junk rated account debtors to put in the pool that is additional variable risk. ",

                    "content": "Dear @roollie @DavidJeng  , The process for MIP6 applications for off-chain collateral, so called real-wold assets, has been under significant review by the teams involved in collateral onboarding (RWF, CES, Growth and incubating LTS and LOVE). See more for collateral onboarding process. The goal of this process update is to provide MKR tokenholders and respective delegates a comprehensive view of MIP6-RWA applications from a credit, legal and technology perspective so tokenholders can make a more informed decision before moving applications through the execution of the onboarding process after greenlight. As part of this review, MIP67 and the underlying Methodology for structured finance transactions were written to provide applicants with a more comprehensive set of guidelines and requirements so MIP6 applications are fit for purpose and closer to a state where they could be executed, if prioritised by tokenholders during polls. MIP67 is now part of the MIP6 process. It is designed to fill the gaps in the MIP6 application for RWAs. Our domain team is aligned to the approved MIP67 process and Methodology. We are asking MIP6-RWA applicants to express whether they will retrofit their MIP6 applications in line with MIP67/Methodology guidelines. We ask applicants to express their intention by Mon 9 May at 12pm UTC. The collateral application template is located here: MIPs Portal. Status of MIP6 applications that do not express their interest by 9 May will be considered \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from a MIP6 collateral onboarding point of view by the aforementioned Core Units and reflected in the CSI . We understand that once applicants express their intentions, there will be a period for drafting and updating documentation of the newly proposed MIP6 applications. Our teams will be available to provide guidance to applicants during this time. Kind regards, William. ",
