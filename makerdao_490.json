All existing and prospective Core Units are listed with an associated status, as well as corresponding MKR budgets if applicable. All CU expenses are included in the forecast and P&L calculations. We are forecasting to finish 2021 at nearly 13x 2020 FY revenue, the rolling 12 month forecast is even more favorable due to an increase in ETH-A and W-BTC SF rates - if the current market remains stable we would expect $157.8M in revenue next year    Forecast Assumptions: Stability Fee Rates: maintain stable at current levels Liquidation Fees: prior six month average. In September we saw a significant increase in crypto price volatility, leading to $3.5M in liquidation fees. If crypto markets stabilize or downward volatility decreases, it is likely less liquidation fees will be generated. Trading Fees: prior three month average. Opportunities to drive incremental revenue not included in forecast:  Nearly $3.2B USDC and $500M USDP in the PSM that could be invested to earn interest (see @rune\u2019s thread  on investing these assets in ESG credit. Scaling Real World Assets (NS-DROP $20M, SolarX $21M, 6S $15M, FortunaFi $15M, Treasuries), etc. Investing in DAI Integrations (i.e. Compound D3M, Maple D3M) Onboarding additional Staked ETH collaterals Institutional vaults, SushiLPs, CropJoin  As a reminder, non-cash expenses reflect the MKR compensation; green highlighted plans have been approved and red are placeholders. While these expenses impact Net Protocol Income, there is no impact on cash flow. While cash flow is positive, the SB will increase by 1M Dai per week and excess MKR will continue to be burned. However, this model assumes a safe scenario where no MKR is burnt until the SB is above risk targets, which we are currently below. For a detailed breakout of actual expenses incurred to date, please see the following thread and spreadsheet. As with all models we share, please feel free to download and include your own inputs and assumptions. If you have any questions, please let me know. ",

Although each would require deep analysis.     Aes:  Nearly $3.2B USDC and $500M USDP in the PSM that could be invested to earn interest (see @rune\u2019s thread  on investing these assets in ESG credit.   I personally would not feel comfortable to deploy the proprietary part of the balance sheet, with significant liquidity and credit quality requirements, without a very deep understanding of the liquidity profile of all assets and liabilities and a proper ALM exercise.     Aes:  Investing in DAI Derivatives (i.e. Compound D3M, Maple D3M)   I would include Maple among so-called real-world assets rather than a derivative of some kind. Maple, like other platforms, would simplify the access to business financing for Maker via performing onboarding, KYC, ALM, technical wrapping, and risk tranching, but the type of exposure that the protocol would get is mainly credit risk. Obviously we should technically get exposed to a credit derivative, i.e. a tranched note written vs cash flows that ultimately are structured into a derivative instrument, but if we look at it like that, everything is a derivative. Thanks for providing the excel as usual, it is useful for the geeks among us  Merry Christmas! ",

My inclination since these are an expense to actually subtract them from revenue, but if they are subtracted in the cash line (as the cash value) and re-added in the non-cash line because they are income then it becomes a neutral earning line vs. what I would expect which would be a negative vs. a positive or neutral. Can you please explain this because it has a significant effect on when one looks at revenues to expenses.   99.1M earnings on 157M revenues looks a lot better than 68.6M earnings on 157M revenues.

Appreciate the kind words Mungo, glad you\u2019ve found our reporting helpful      MakerMan:  I am looking at how you are accounting for cash vs. non-cash expenses and trying to understand why the non-cash expenses are additive?   Expenses are listed as total and non-cash expenses, not cash and non-cash expenses. Non-cash expenses are expenses that hit the Income Statement but do not have an actual cash transaction - common examples include depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation (100% of MakerDAO\u2019s non-cash expense). Many public companies report non-GAAP earnings which exclude stock-based compensation as a cost which I believe is quite deceptive to investors (GAAP includes it). Warren Buffet explained it well in his 2015 letter to shareholders: \"\u2026it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real. \u2018Stock-based compensation\u2019 is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong? Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don\u2019t know any better. Or maybe they fear losing \u2018access\u2019 to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn\u2019t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.\" ",
