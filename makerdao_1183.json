As balances decrease, you would expect liquidations to take over more and more share of revenue (as in the chart above). In a sudden 90% drawdown you would actually expect liquidations to be significantly higher, assuming they clear efficiently. This would add time to the operating runway at the expense of incinerating our customers, obviously not a good outcome.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Does the ending SB May 23 include liquidation profits based on what amount?   15/19.8 of the revenues in the chart above, on an annualized (monthly x12) basis are from liquidations. This is conservatively low in my view given the scenario, but prudent to manage runway planning. ",
