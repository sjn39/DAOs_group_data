(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): We are proposing that Messari provide the Optimism community with quarterly governance, ecosystem, and financial reports while continuing to build out subgraphs for the ecosystem. This would serve to better inform existing stakeholders as well as attract new ones while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.These reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter (250k subscribers), social channels, and third-party distribution partners including Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Thomson Reuters.Governance ServicesGovernance Season recaps- Track OP distributions across Ecosystem Funds, retroactive public goods funding, and airdrops.- Category breakdown of Governance Fund distributions.- Delegate analysis looks at how voting power distribution and delegate participation rates have changed.- Governance process analysis aggregates individual proposal results and provides structural analysis on process pain points, community feedback, and potential improvementsInvestor RelationsQuarterly reporting- Present and analyze major KPIs and fundamental metrics (transactions, fees, protocol revenue)- Network-level stats (contracts deployed, developer activity).- Distribution across Bloomberg terminal, S&P Capital IQ, Refinitiv- Continued subgraph development for Optimism ecosystem projectsInitiation of coverageOur standard protocol deep dive that breaks down what Optimism is building and why it matters, while contextualizing it within the broader crypto landscape.It will also delve into a comparative analysis and breakdown of the token economics.Ecosystem reportEcosystem report Highlighting the major project\u2019s building across various verticals such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc. contextualizing why they are built on Optimism compared to other base layers.

While projects often have scattered data dashboards, analytics pages, or other resources to better understand the protocol and the economic activity around it, there remains a need for standardized reporting so that anyone can analyze it like they would a company\u2019s annual financial statement.The standardized reports mentioned above are arguably more important in an environment committed to \u2018relentlessly iterating\u2019 on experimentation, where iterating on the impact of past decisions is the driving force behind future decisions. Without a full view of which aspects of past experiments worked (or didn\u2019t), the community faces an uphill battle in making the optimal decision for future iterations.Additionally, there is no readily available data infrastructure to pull relevant metrics to assess the network as a whole and individual ecosystem projects. This makes proper analysis difficult for any developers or analysts looking to pull raw data. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Messari\u2019s team of Data Scientists and Research Analysts are committed to providing credibly-neutral, data-driven reports to assist the broader Optimism community in making high-impact decisions. By combining our protocol and ecosystem deep-dives along with our recurring governance and quarterly reports, the community can easily remain informed on all aspects comprising Optimism.Additionally we\u2019ll be improving the tooling available to facilitate a more robust developer community through the creation and maintenance of subgraphs that bootstrap the open-source infrastructure for anyone to create powerful tools. While we recently became core subgraph developers we\u2019ve already seen this in action with third-party developers using our subgraphs to build dashboards 5 to track liquidations across top lending platforms. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: This proposal is designed to grow the Optimism ecosystem by attracting new stakeholders through better surfacing of fundamental data, governance initiatives, and core developments. Without adequate investor relations services and standardized reporting, it can be difficult for new entrants to find reliable data with the necessary context to make sense of it in order to make informed decisions. We aim to create the 10Q equivalent in the same way anyone can go to Apple\u2019s financial statements to learn more about the company and its performance, anyone can publicly see Optimism\u2019s reports to learn more about the protocol and observe it\u2019s performance. Over time, this will bring more stakeholders into the ecosystem who will be more likely to contribute value to the DAO, allocating their time and money to grow the network.Not only are we creating these reports but we\u2019re ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messari\u2019s channels of over a quarter million crypto-natives, which reach most of the active professionals in the industry as well as through our distribution relationships with Bloomberg, S&P, and Refinitiv. This goes a long way to further professionalize Optimism to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporates in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful volume to Optimism and its ecosystem projects. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: Yes - [Ready] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] MessariThe feedback was mostly around the Governance Fund being the correct avenue for funding not the submission itself Number of OP tokens requested: 175000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: n/a How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): n/a How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): The OP tokens will be used to fund internal resources. Which include:Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. We also have protocol specialists working with engineering to create the schema for subgraphs (ex: standardizing what protocol revenue look like for different sectors on Optimism ecosystem projects)Data science - Each report will have its own dedicated data scientist tasked with providing all the relevant raw dataMarketing - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari\u2019s channels along with the third-party partners Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: n/a Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Governance Services: Published prior to the beginning of each season, for the next four seasons.Investor Relations:Initiation of Coverage: One-time report released late Q1 .Quarterly Reporting: Quarterly reporting for the next four quarters beginning Q1 and released early April Ecosystem Reporting will be released in Q2 Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: n/a Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): n/a Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

I\u2019d also be open to governance removing this restriction and establishing a more transparent process for the partner fund to reward a valuable resource like Messari reports. I\u2019ve said it in the past, but the most optimal solution would be the Optimism Foundation working directly with Messari to get this resource across the line. See my prior thoughts on the subject: Continuing the discussion from [Ready] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Messari:    [Ready] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Messari   Hey guys, I\u2019m one of the Synthetix Ambassadors, and I support this proposal. However, I am only 1 of 5 elected ambassadors, so this is not an indication of a yes vote (we currently have voted abstain, following the committee). Optimism GREATLY lacks an official DeFi media presence, so this proposal is an excellent step in the right direction. I\u2019d go further and say that Optimism should have these sorts of agreements set up with other media groups. Though I will say that I\u2019m afraid I massively have to disagree with this decision being pushed onto Delegates. The OP foundation\u2019s marketing + comms CCs should handle this internally (alongside other media agreements similar to this one). It\u2019s a tough decision to push onto delegates whose typical mandate has strayed far from this one. I know the OP foundation has advised that this is the correct path, but I disagree. They should handle this one internally and use the pot of OP they have to pay for it, or even do some 50/50 split. But anyway, this proposal is still up in the air, and I think it is helpful and a step in the right direction for OP. The Ambassador vote is still the same (abstain), but I just wanted to drop my thoughts here as other delegates decide.   But on that vein, I\u2019ve already connected Jack from Messari with @lavande and Smit to coordinate on the Partner Fund. As GFX labs said though, there is no way for the governance fund to fund this proposal. ",
