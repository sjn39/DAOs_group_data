I am not talking about new cryptocurrency projects, no. I will be happy to see a couple of large and important non-commercial information projects not related to cryptocurrencies, such as Wikipedia (this example only about non commercial and wide usage, not to copy the idea itself), etc. I may be missing something, but I think that this discussion can strengthen the impact of the blockchain in general and the Etherium ecosystem separately in our new digital world. Thank you. ",
