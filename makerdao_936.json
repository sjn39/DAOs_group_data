RWAs: The Crux of the Asset Class The Theory of RWA-elativity: The Surplus Buffer MakerDAO Principles: A Man\u2019s Gotta Have A Code Parlaying Principles into Action: The Case For Continuity Innovating on the RWA Protocol   The Final Chapter: The Case For Continuity  It is early April. The birds are singing and the frost of a bear market is showing signs of thawing. The degens are aping and MakerDAO is still here. Chugging along, generating a profit. This is DAIs fifth spring and its roots have never been stronger. The MakerDAO community is understandably excited about broadening the scope of DAI beyond the narrow halls of crypto. In conceptualizing how the onboarding of Real World Assets will affect the stability, scale, and decentralization of DAI, let\u2019s first take a quick look at MakerDAO\u2019s evolution as a protocol. As we travel through time from crypto loans to the Peg Stability Module to the Direct Deposit Module, we will re-orient ourselves to why these products were rolled out and the basket of attributes each has to offer. Only then can we operate from a frame where we can evaluate RWAs vis vis how the entire system works and how DAI, its lifeblood, is affected. MakerDAO 1.0 - Crypto Loans MakerDAO is a permissionless, non-custodial lending protocol. In its initial formulation, MakerDAO enabled borrowers to deposit eligible crypto collateral and issue a DAI-denominated loan to themselves. At this stage, only by locking compliant crypto collateral, like Ether, in the protocol could users spur DAI into existence. At the start, Ether was the only eligible crypto collateral for the launch of a DAI vault. The protocol bootstrapped around Ether because it was deemed to retain fundamental qualities that would allow the protocol to grow sustainably and safely. Ether was liquid, lindy, and had long since served a role to crypto-natives as a store of value. Only after the rails of self-lending had been traversed by SAI, or single collateral DAI, did the remit expand to include other types of collateral, like WBTC and LINK. Please keep this basic sequence in mind. We will return to the concept of battle-testing and strengthening infrastructure through moderate, but not extreme stressors. (dw I will spare the forums from the actual Talebism. He neither A) deadlifts enough nor B) retains enough of a grasp on basic premise of crypto-economic systems for me to mention his name in these sacred halls) Crypto Loans Balance Sheet At this point, Maker\u2019s balance sheet was relatively simple: DAI outstanding in the liabilities column and loans against crypto collateral outstanding in the asset column. The loans are assets to the protocol because they are expected to provide economic value, or profit, to MakerDAO. DAI is a liability to the protocol. It represents one explicit obligation and one implicit obligation. Explicit: DAI redemptions are honored. Implicit: 1 DAI can be redeemed for 1 USD on the open market at all times. (Not redeemable at Maker protocol\u2014the protocol does not deal in USD markets)  959\u00d7738 21 KB  Maker 1.0: Crypto Loans Risks & Mitigants    Liquidity Risk: Inability to liquidate depreciating crypto collateral A) in a timely manner and B) at a price that makes the protocol whole     Security Risk: Exploitation of faulty smart contracts and subsequent loss of user/treasury funds     Scaling Risk: Because DAI loans are over-collateralized and capital inefficient for users, require users to pay interest at occasionally unpredictable rates, and are only accessible on-chain via non-cefi wallets, access to and demand for DAI may be constrained. The total addressable market of crypto-loan generated DAI is only so large.    Due to the structure of the initial Maker protocol, credit risk, or the possibility that a borrower defaults on his/her obligations to the protocol, was almost non-existent. To obviate credit risk, MakerDAO loans are:  Overcollateralized: crypto collateral in Maker vault > DAI loan principal outstanding Self-Liquidating: if crypto collateral depreciates, it will automatically be auctioned unless the user deposits additional collateral to satisfy the protocol\u2019s overcollateralization.  Liquidity risk for most crypto collateral is very low. MakerDAO-compliant crypto collateral is standardized (ERC-20) and can usually be auctioned off quickly. The larger the position (such as those of the infamous Seven Siblings), the more difficult to offload on the open market at a desirable price. Maker 1.0: Structural Design A central component of MakerDAO 1.0 was the suite of monetary levers that the token holders could pull to adjust for economic conditions. The key lever was the ability to adjust the money (DAI) supply via interest rates. The DAI savings rate (DSR) and the stability fees on MakerDAO vaults could be tweaked as per the needs of the protocol. This mechanism is akin to a central bank\u2019s wielding of a benchmark rate against which all debt is priced.  1600\u00d7821 183 KB  If there was too much demand for DAI relative to supply, the stability fees (interest) on loans could be adjusted upwards to incentivize borrowers to close their vaults, snuffing out demand for DAI. An extreme example of this occurred during the summer of 2019, when stability fees went from 2% to 19% in a few months in an effort to push the peg back down. Please keep the importance of these monetary levers in mind\u2014we will return to this structural boon.  1600\u00d7570 98.3 KB  As a last resort for protocol losses, MakerDAO eventually implemented a surplus buffer in late 2019. This is a reserve of DAI deliberately retained for a rainy day. Normally, excess DAI in the protocol (profit) would be utilized to burn MKR, rewarding token holders for savvy collateral onboarding. The surplus buffer cushions MKR token holders against losses driven by bad debt.  1600\u00d7798 212 KB  TLDR: Crypto loans represent a fairly low risk to the protocol. Liquidity risk is low but non-zero and would arise during a precipitous crypto market down turn. The surplus buffer is designed to hedge away the potential for protocol losses during these market crises. Credit risk is virtually non-existent, as Maker 1.0 is structured in such a way that makes borrower default impossible (sans smart contract issues). Finally, stability fees on crypto-loans can be adjusted by the community to incentivize DAI vaults to open or close, matching supply of DAI with demand for DAI, and reasserting the peg. MakerDAO 2.0 - PSM & Convenience DAI Soon after the era during which MakerDAO governance spiked stability fees in an effort to reassert the peg, the protocol integrated an additional lever to help maintain the peg. The Peg Stability Module, or PSM, represented a new mechanism (beyond crypto loans) by which DAI could be conceived. Instead of requiring that a user self-lend DAI against crypto collateral in an over-collateralized fashion, users could costlessly swap stablecoins (USDP, GUSD, USDC) for DAI. This mechanism achieved two ends: 1. It increased demand for and circulation of DAI (convenience DAI) 2. It further strengthened the DAI peg through arbitrage: traders were incentivized to eliminate deltas between the stables in the PSM. DAI could now be minted in a non-overcollateralized manner that would generate no revenue for the protocol. Maker 2.0: PSM Balance Sheet The PSM introduced different assets and similar liabilities to the Maker protocol. USDP, GUSD, and USDC would be onboarded as assets. DAI liabilities would grow as the protocol incurs an obligation to fulfill users\u2019 redemption of DAI for the aforementioned stables. Due to the under-collateralization of the PSM (1:1, as opposed to 1:1.5 as per crypto-vaults), the leverage ratio of MakerDAO rose. Stablecoin assets in the PSM differed from risky crypto assets on the balance sheet in one more way: assets collateralizing crypto loans were untouchable by Maker\u2014PSM assets can be reinvested into other projects as per the direction of MKR governance.  714\u00d7362 30.9 KB  Source: Sebastien Derivaux - How Money Works The above graphic shows the balance sheets of a typical central and commercial bank, respectively. MakerDAO, and thus its balance sheet represents a sort of hybrid of the two. DAI is a liability to the protocol. It represents both a \u201cbank note\u201d issued by a central bank and a \u201cbank deposit\u201d account within a commercial bank. MakerDAO\u2019s crypto loans are akin to the loans (mortgages, asset-backed, business facilities etc.) originated by and held in the asset column of commercial banks. The stablecoins in the PSM are assets for MakerDAO and serve a function similar to the foreign exchange reserves held by central banks. Central banks use their FX reserves to manipulate their domestic currency in such a way to fulfill economic and monetary objectives at home.  959\u00d7738 17.7 KB  PSM: Risks & Mitigants  Centralization Risk    Credit Risk: MakerDAO 2.0 introduces a greater degree of credit risk. Because DAI is being minted against stablecoins issued and maintained by institutions, the protocol necessarily incurs a de facto counterparty exposure. If these stablecoin issuers fail to maintain their respective pegs or to back their stablecoins with the promised reserves (a la Tether), they\u2019ve effectively defaulted on their obligation to the market. Associatively, the PSM exposes MakerDAO to the credit risk of Circle, Paxos, and Gemini.     Blacklist Risk: a similar, albeit slightly different spin on the credit risk above is the potential for blacklisting. If Circle, Paxos, or Gemini fall victim to a regulatory crackdown, demand for and thus price of their respective stables may tumble. MakerDAO is thus left holding sizable amounts of devalued collateral in the PSM.     Revenue Risk: MakerDAO may be incurring the aforementioned risks without commensurate compensation. (The PSM was approved by governance. The community thus necessarily feels that the opportunities for scale/liquidity more than offset the lack of revenue. Further, the jury is still out on whether stablecoin assets will be deployed productively or will remain at rest )   1600\u00d7633 149 KB  In the case of the PSM, credit risk and blacklist risk are aggravated by concentration in Circle, the issuer of USDC. If the distribution within the PSM or among the PSM and other collateral types was more diffuse, the credit risk and blacklist risk would drop commensurately. The final risk, revenue risk, is a lack of an opportunity\u2014the opportunity to generate revenue for the protocol, which MakerDAO 1.0 was quite good at. Note: For all intents and purposes, technical \u201ccredit risk\u201d of USDC is actually low. This is because credit risk refers primarily to a borrower\u2019s inability to fulfill its debt obligations. Because USDC is backed by dollars in a bank account or short-term money market instruments, as long as those reserves genuinely exist, the de facto credit risk is that of the US government, which is effectively zero but growing. TLDR: While it bolsters the peg and expands access to DAI, the PSM brings single-point of failure risk to the protocol. This centralization risk, primarily that of Circle, is not offset by a commensurate surge in revenues. MakerDAO 3.0 - Direct Deposit Module (D3M) The direct deposit module is a mechanism by which DAI liquidity is injected directly into external DeFi protocols like Aave. MakerDAO recognized Aave as a reputable protocol and have effectively extended the right to mint DAI to its platform. This hedges borrowers in the Aave money markets against spiking DAI borrowing rates. In the case of Aave, the D3M adjusts the supply of DAI algorithmically to fix an interest rate for borrowers of DAI (in the case of Aave, 3.5% gross to borrowers, less after Aave token rewards). To the benefit of DAI borrowers throughout DeFi, the D3M delivers predictability in their cost of capital. To the benefit of MakerDAO, the D3M adds a distribution channel for supplying DAI in other DeFi environments. aDai, a yield-bearing token that represents DAI deposited in the Aave protocol, serves as the collateral against which the D3M is secured. In summary, the D3M allows MakerDAO to onboard the debts of various DeFi protocols as assets while continuing to expand the issuance of DAI as a liability. As a kicker, by providing DAI to external protocols, MakerDAO earns farms those protocols\u2019 native tokens, lengthening MakerDAO\u2019s governance arm and diversifying its treasury. D3M Balance Sheet The D3M compliments the humble realization that MakerDAO cannot be an expert at everything. Other protocols, for example Aave, are specialists within their domains. The D3M empowers specialist protocols with cheap, consistent credit lines. Please keep this principle in mind for when we discuss how to structure RWAs.  959\u00d7738 21 KB  D3M: Risks & Mitigants    Liquidity Risk: MakerDAO inherits the liquidation risk of other DeFi protocols.     Security Risk: MakerDAO inherits vulnerability to faulty smart contracts that may exist inside other DeFi protocols.    TLDR: The D3M extends the reach of MakerDAO\u2019s DeFi lending arm by composing other protocols. The risks to this business are effectively the same as those of Maker\u2019s native crypto loans. MakerDAO - 2022 Snapshot  992\u00d7496 107 KB   905\u00d7816 28.3 KB  Maker 4.0 - Real World Assets RWAs refer specifically to assets that exist outside of the world of smart contracts and inside the world of legal ones (for the most part)\u2014e.g. trade finance loans, bridge mortgages, renewable energy project loans, and carbon credits. 6S Capital and New Silver serve as examples of counterparties currently utilizing MakerDAO vaults to finance the origination of real world assets. RWAs are fundamentally different from crypto assets, whether loans, stablecoins, or DeFi protocol debt. They are varied, messy, and much, much more difficult to reverse/liquidate than a ledger entry on an ERC-20 contract on Ethereum. When times are good, both crypto and RWA vaults cash flow as promised. When times are bad, crypto assets are liquidated seamlessly while RWAs may enter a complicated process involving special servicing, courts, receivers and investment banks. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the asset is located, receivership and liquidation processes may look completely different. Whereas ETH, WBTC, and LINK are all liquidated via the same, predictable mechanism, mortgages in Pennsylvania, consumer invoices in the Netherlands, and BNPL receivables in Indonesia behave drastically differently during a down market. As we stated at the beginning of the piece, RWAs should be approached from a bird\u2019s eye view of the entire protocol. Only by understanding how these novel assets fit into the broader system can we proceed successfully. To chart an appropriate scaling strategy for real world asset vaults, we must evaluate this next evolution of MakerDAO via the framework we\u2019ve worked within thus far:    How does exposure to RWAs affect the economic reality of MakerDAO?     What opportunities do RWAs present to the protocol?     What are the risks against which those opportunities should be weighed?     How should the community structure its RWA exposures in a way that mitigates risks while driving revenues?    1. RWAs and The Economic Realities of MakerDAO In the case of crypto-native loans, MakerDAO dictates stability fees and will adjust them to reduce or increase loans outstanding. This mechanism enables the protocol to manage supply and demand and thus the peg. In the case of the D3M, MakerDAO wields similar levers: it algorithmically adjusts the Aave-native borrow rate and can withdraw liquidity on an as-needed basis. RWAs do not come built with these levers. Worthy counter-parties to whom MakerDAO issues RWA vaults require a level of predictability to operate their businesses effectively (and by extension to honor their obligations to MakerDAO). \u201cPredictability\u201d entails a few things.  Callability: Unlike with crypto-native loans and the D3M, loans against real world assets should/can not be called back quickly. Borrowers need assurance that we will not pull the rug from under their operation. Further, even if we wanted to call their loan and rug them, their assets would not be easy to liquidate. Inflexibility: Keeping rates steady (if fixed) or correlated to real-world rates like LIBOR and SOFR (if floating).  Parties who operate in the real world are betrothed to real world interest rates and business conditions. For MakerDAO to deliver a predictable UX to those who face the protocol, for example RWA managers, is to empower those businesses to execute at a high level in their domain. This in turn increases the odds that MakerDAO will get paid back. It is unthinkable for a high-quality manager to do business with us if the foundation keeps shifting. To become a dependable partner in RWA credit markets, we must generate confidence in the market that we have consistent principles and structures that we stick to. We cannot expect to do business with high quality asset managers if we demand they operate as per the whims of MakerDAO\u2019s internal monetary and fiscal requirements. At least not yet. What all this means is that by onboarding RWAs the protocol sacrifices some of the levers it has historically relied upon to meet its needs. By their nature, the onboarding of RWAs means a less flexible, more patient, and MUCH LARGER balance sheet.     Characteristic Crypto Loans Real World Assets     Fungible/Homogenous     Callable     Flexible: terms can be changed     Easy-to-Price     No Counterparty Risk     Low Liquidity Risk     Zero Credit Risk      2. RWAs - Opportunities RWAs can address each corner of the DAI-lemma:  1600\u00d7883 47.9 KB  Scale: For DeFi to fulfill its potential, it needs to integrate, not steamroll traditional finance. For DAI to generate scale and utility, it must provide a bridge between atoms and bits. Like the Bering Strait, such a bridge provides access to a completely new and much larger market. To finance real world assets is to expand DAI\u2019s reach beyond the narrow corridors of DeFi. While the total crypto market cap is ~2T, global fixed income is $199T, global equities are $125T, and global real estate is $326T.  1600\u00d7475 367 KB  Stability: The peg is currently maintained through incentives\u2014monetary levers (stability fees on crypto loans and D3M, DSR etc.) and an arbitrage facility (PSM). In reality, DAI represents a social contract between the market and the protocol: MakerDAO will onboard strong assets, reject weak assets, and structure vaults in a way that protects the protocol from losses. To bring strong, crypto-uncorrelated real world assets on-chain is to diversify the collateral base, reduce centralization risk, and strengthen the social contract. To the uninitiated (most of the outside world), a \u201ccrypto-currency\u201d pegged to the dollar via crypto-native collateral seems circular, maybe cute. But when that same synthetic dollar is being used in the real world by established institutions, other stronger counterparties will notice. The perception of DAI and its peg will strengthen, causing DAI to be stickier, which will strengthen the actual peg which will open more doors to higher and higher quality collateral and partnerships. Stronger and more diverse RWA collateral will feed the perception of a strong peg and so on and so forth\u2026  1218\u00d7866 68.9 KB  Decentralization: The PSM expanded access to DAI and bolstered its peg but sacrificed some decentralization (resiliency really) and potential yield. RWAs provide an opportunity to diversify MakerDAO\u2019s Circle counterparty risk and to drive some additional yield to the protocol. \u201cWith enough trusted counterparties spread across enough vaults, you have a sort of decentralized exposure\u201d - @rune , more or less, in the ReFi Podcast. How MakerDAO Asset Mix Changes if PSM is Invested in RWA  944\u00d7420 147 KB  The above visual shows how USDC centralization risk is ameliorated in the case that RWA vaults are funded via assets currently in the PSM. This exercise is instructive but likely non-practical. Instead of financing RWAs directly with PSM assets, RWAs will be financed via canonical DAI vaults which will dilute the current USDC concentration. The Short-Term Bond Strategy could be funded through the PSM, as the nature of such assets are much more liquid and low-risk. As @NikKunkel posited on Bankless, the PSM is a stockpile of financial energy for re-investment into other productive, yield-bearing strategic assets. *Approximate **Expenses would be significant, unlike with the PSM In the hypothetical scenario above, the protocol\u2019s USDC exposure falls by $3.4B, or 20% of the total collateral in MakerDAO vaults. Annual revenue increases by $176MM to $276MM, or a YoY increase of 176%. 3. RWAs - Risks In the case where token holders choose to dilute USDC concentration with RWAs, they must also consider, at a fundamental level, what novel risks the novel asset mix will entail. As mentioned previously, ERC-20\u2019s are homogenous\u2026RWAs are not. Each RWA MIP-6 application carries different underlying assets, credit quality, geographical idiosyncrasies, proposed economics etc. As such, Real World Assets lack a certain determinism, elegance, and efficiency that the remainder of MakerDAO\u2019s assets carry. Unlike with crypto-native loans, as RWAs scale, the biggest risks are neither centralization vectors nor trust assumptions but rather loss. It is always easy to put money out the door. It is much more difficult to get paid back. The following risks, if not heeded and structured around properly, may conspire to drive losses to the protocol. Credit Risk: what is the likelihood that the borrower fails to pay MakerDAO back? Liquidity Risk: what is the likelihood that it is difficult to liquidate/auction assets quickly at favorable prices during adverse market conditions? Legal/Structural Risk: do the choice of jurisdiction, the overall legal structure, and the contractual terms facilitate the probability of repayment and mitigate risks to MakerDAO? Counterparty Risk: what is the risk that the counterparties to whom MakerDAO chooses to extend credit will erode its reputation in the marketplace? Does associating with a given asset originator, by virtue of its historical performance, the track record of its principals, its domain of operations, or any other characteristic, imbue the market with doubt around the competence/maturity of MakerDAO\u2019s RWA arm? In my opinion, these combined factors capture the broad categorical risks that RWAs pose to the MakerDAO protocol. They can be summed to represent DAI stability risk, or systemic protocol risk.  1600\u00d7907 105 KB  In the \u201cOpportunities\u201d section, we discussed the reflexivity between strong collateral and the peg and how RWAs could buoy it. Conversely, if approached incorrectly, RWAs can unwind the stability as well. Positive feedback loops are devilish\u2014they push systems to extremes in both directions. During the cypriot financial crisis in 2012-2013, Cypriot banks who were over-exposed to over-leveraged property companies ran into trouble when property values dropped, as they had worldwide. (They were also exposed to Greek sov. debt) Ultimately bank loans (assets) went bad and it became obvious to depositors that the Cypriot banking system was functionally insolvent. A bank run ensued as fear spread contagiously through Cypriot savers. Bad Collateral \u2192 Broken Obligations \u2192 Panic/Exit \u2192 Systemic Collapse TLDR: In both their opportunities and their risks, RWAs are fundamentally different from any and all historical collateral types. They involve greater (expected loss) and broader (financial and reputational risk) risks than crypto-native collateral, but enable a quantum of lending impossible within crypto. RWAs present a strategic growth vector to the MakerDAO protocol but MUST be onboarded in a tame, measured way. 4. How should the community structure its RWA exposures? The Crux of the Asset Class DAI can be printed out of thin air because it is inextricably linked to something of value. The market can verify what sort of value is sitting in a MakerDAO vault on-chain. Instead of the Gold Standard, this is the Maker Standard. When prospective crypto collateral submits its MIP-6, token holders and delegates can assay its fundamental properties and make an informed judgment about the risk it poses to DAI and MakerDAO. What are its liquidity characteristics? What is the appetite like for the token during adverse market conditions? How long has it been circulating? How secure are the protocol\u2019s smart contracts? Only by asking the right questions do we gather the answers required to protect the protocol from losses. What is today a fairly standard examination conducted on all ERC-20 collateral was, surely, painstakingly launched by a handful of core protocol devs in the early days. These were domain experts who understood the essence of the assets they were considering allowing into the sacred halls of MakerDAO. Having gathered the required information on prospective collateral, the token holders (initially) would transform those risks into a suitable vault structure (SF, collateralization etc.). Today the onus of setting vault parameters rests largely on Risk, a small group steeped in crypto-native risk. Maker token holders have demonstrated tremendous judgment in onboarding collateral thus far. It\u2019s this shrewdness and long-term orientation that imbues MakerDAo\u2019s brand with cache. The broad, neat taxonomy of credit risk, liquidity risk, legal/structural risk, and counterparty risk betrays the complexity involved in underwriting, executing, monitoring, and unwinding a structured finance transaction: triaging the deal, understanding industry and geographical idiosyncrasies, managing the various service providers and parties involved, scrutinizing performance history of asset type and sponsors, negotiating the myriad terms and ensuring they do not deviate from market standard, modifying and understanding legal documents, growing and retaining a constellation of external counsel across various geographies, generating a model for the liquidity characteristics of a given RWA, constructing a concentration matrix that appropriately hedges against loss, conducting sponsor due diligence, ensuring incentives are aligned, structuring overcollateralization ratios and first-loss capital among many, many more functions. If this list of activities has lulled you to sleep, this is what is important:  1600\u00d7225 122 KB  The Theory of RWA-elativity: The Surplus Buffer I liked the spirit of @Hexonaut\u2019s @Nadia\u2019s @krzkaczor\u2019s \u201cAggressive Growth Strategy\u201d. It is nonsensical to consider the RWA scaling path in a vacuum. Our risk appetite on RWAs should be considered vis a vis the thickness of the surplus buffer. Because RWA exposures are lumpy due to credit risk, adding a cushion allows us to explore not only more experimental deals but more importantly larger single concentrations to tremendous counterparties. With a surplus buffer of $67MM, MakerDAO can afford to take some fairly large risks on RWAs. Currently, one $500MM vault with a 13.4% loss would blow through the cushion. With a surplus buffer of $250MM, the opportunity set drastically changes. With that said, just because we CAN stomach losses, doesn\u2019t mean we SHOULD stomach losses. MakerDAO can and will continue to business with established, institutional counterparties like Huntingdon Valley Bank and Societe Generale. This access comes on the back of years of reputation-building. The DAO should think long and hard about what signals a blase underwriting policy and cavalier attitude towards losses sends to the marketplace. Do we want to be perceived more as a central bank or a Softbank? MakerDAO Principles: A Man\u2019s Gotta Have a Code To me, the below are broad principles ingrained in the MakerDAO constitution:   Battle-Testing: First battle test infrastructure, then go out on the risk curve (Crypto loans)  Specialization: recognize skill and empower experts (D3M, DAO of DAOS)  User Experience: Deliver consistency and predictability to users (PSM, D3M)  Decentralization: Progressively decentralize (Maker Ethos)  Infinite Games: Play long-term games with long term people, don\u2019t cut corners. \u201cA finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.\u201d - James Carse (Maker Ethos)  Battle-Testing: From the beginning, MakerDAO has taken care to battle-test the rails before going out on the risk curve. SAI was bootstrapped with ETH, a blue-chip \u201ccounterparty\u201d with great fundamental qualities: liquidity, Lindy, proven store of value etc. As the protocol grew into its lending business and the rails hardened, governance opened up the aperture of its all-knowing eye to include other strategic assets. Neither confined to crypto-native loans nor to RWAs, this patient and long-term approach is engrained in the constitution of MakerDAO: start safe, learn, and open up. Specialization: MakerDAO appreciates Adam Smith and Clausewitz just as much as we do Darwin. The D3M expressed a humility that MakerDAO cannot be expert at everything. We recognize, for example, that Aave is damn good at what it does and wish to empower such prowess with cheap, predictable credit. Even within the DAO, core units are domain-specific experts who inherit an objective and are given the remit and resources to execute within that domain in the ways they see fit. UX: From crypto loans to the PSM to the D3M, MakerDAO\u2019s products are easy, convenient, and cheap to use. Crypto loan terms can be customized by the user. The PSM is instant and costless. The D3M delivers a predictable cost of capital to DAI borrowers on Aave and soon Maple, Compound, or Rari. Decentralization: Won\u2019t belabor this one. Infinite Games: MakerDAO is oriented towards the long-term. Built into the history, culture, and governance of Maker is the refusal to cut corners and to do things the right way.  1202\u00d7260 89.1 KB  Parlaying Principles into Action: The Case For Continuity RWAs are where crypto-native loans were in 2017. Just as the rails for crypto-loans were being laid then, so the rails for RWAs are being laid now. I agree with @monet-supply characterization on Bankless: MakerDAO\u2019s RWA protocol is akin to a token bridge. Messages need to be shuttled between one consensus environment (the real world) to another (on-chain) and back. MakerDAO governance actions must be expressed via physical actions off-chain. Real world assets need to be parked in an off-chain custodian and represented on-chain in MakerDAO vaults. Continuing the analogy, to avoid a Wormhole or Ronin scenario, secure and audited contracts (legal ones) and a robust oracle mechanism (pricing) are key. Returning from the land of analogy, MakerDAO needs to come to consensus around the RWF core unit\u2019s role, which assets to add, how to structure those transactions, and how to monitor the ongoing risk that such assets pose to the protocol. I believe, to the best of our ability, we should encode the RWA strategy with the same principles that got us here. Let\u2019s not lose the plot.   Rail Construction: Build the RWA \u201cprotocol\u201d from the ground up the right way. This means pursuing robust legal architecture and asset-specific and jurisdiction-specific support, building thoughtful mechanisms that allow token votes to dictate real world actions, designing deal structures to hedge against credit loss, and working with CES to address technical implementation correctly.  Battle-Testing Rails with Strong Collateral: Just as we did with ETH/SAI for the early days of crypto loans, start RWA with collateral with fundamentally strong properties. We should avoid esoteric asset classes with high risk of default. No New Guinean sovereign debt, and no cobalt mine financing. As the RWA rails become more Lindy, higher-risk freight should be added. If the \u201cAggressive Growth Strategy\u201d is ratified, I see these initiatives as moving in parallel. In other words, as profits flow in and the surplus grows, the RWA rails will have progressively hardened and the protocol can look towards newer, riskier collateral types.  Specialization/UX: Empower best-in-class managers with cheap capital. Make it easy and predictable to deal with MakerDAO as a senior secured lender.  Organically Decentralize: Dilute Circle Risk in the PSM by adding a series of large, secure vaults across a series of excellent managers and asset classes. Rather than accuse RWF of \u201cgatekeeping\u201d or \u201ccentralization\u201d, decentralization, or resilience at the cost of efficiency, will occur organically over time. When things were uncertain, the Foundation bootstrapped the protocol and captained it through the fog through focus and execution. It dissolved as things started to hum. RWF should be no different\u2014the community either trusts us to apply our skill and do our jobs or it doesn\u2019t. As RWA assets are added, RWF will undergo mitosis. RWF will split into sub-groups based on geography, asset class, or any number of other dimensions. This is the direction that everyone wants to move\u2014we all recognize the existential risk of single points of failure.  Infinite Games: MakerDAO should approach RWAs in an effort to continue playing the role of DeFi\u2019s progenitor. We must start safe and then, of course, innovate! Adding more entrepreneurial and experimental collateral as per strategic objectives. RWF is already starting to explore external protocols crafting de novo assets on-chain and representing existing assets via tokenization.  Innovating on the RWA Protocol As per the Case for Clean Money, MakerDAO will strategically add green, experimental, and entrepreneurial deals and let those run on soon-to-be war-tested commercial and legal rails.  RWF would seek to increasingly work with protocols actually tokenizing assets and bringing them on-chain (Regen, Toucan, Bacon etc) Either MakerDAO or other protocols will construct, de novo, on-chain financial instruments that hedge out messy RWA risks, morphing such exposures to more closely resemble crypto-native ones.  We\u2019d look to pursue initiatives such as building greening incentives and on-chain verification mechanisms into RWA vault stability fees or other terms. Any real world mission the community wishes to reinforce can theoretically be captured by combining an oracle with a responsive cost of capital. Maker\u2019s current cost of capital is zero\u2014this is a superpower. We can capitalize on the rising rate environment to pick off strategic assets and reward their operators via financial incentives. RWF will work with the community to find novel ways of carving trust and centralizing vectors out of the RWA protocol. We look forward to productive debate around how a constellation of token holders can efficiently and responsibly govern real world conduits that hold a diverse set of assets. A recently proposed structure where an on-chain MKR vote will direct the actions of a trustee (who presides over a trust that holds assets) serves as a promising taste of what is to come. Because the origination, negotiation around, funding, management, and disposition of RWAs is new for DeFi, many of these mechanisms will serve as a foundation for other DeFi protocols to build on. With this power comes great responsibility. I cannot emphasize enough how complicated the real world is and in how many ways the protocol can be subverted if this basic fact is not respected. But the corollary is even more noteworthy: the opportunity to take a messy, off-chain system and bring efficiencies, standards, and transparency to it is enormous. The Final Chapter: The Case For Continuity DAI is the lifeblood of MakerDAO. It\u2019s $9.5B footprint represents deep trust. Trust that the MakerDAO protocol is secure. Trust that MakerDAO token holders will continue to exercise excellent judgment. Trust that the collateral backing the peg is strong. Belief in the peg and the peg itself are the same thing. If done right, RWAs make the protocol less nimble but stronger. As anything grows older, it generates Lindyness. Lindyness, to me, is the staying power of collective belief. Beliefs are not created equal\u2014some are fleeting and others are woven into the fabric of society. DAI and MakerDAO are powerful Lindy brands. Within crypto, the brands face some competition. Beyond crypto, the brands do not yet hold cache. But they sure as hell will if we chart the right path. As DAI and Maker continue to survive and thrive, the market will tacitly believe in the peg more and more. By bridging into the real world, these brands can extend beyond DeFi and subsequently strengthen their mindshare in both DeFi and TradFi. MakerDAO can afford to relinquish control of some of its levers for the sake of scale, revenue growth, and decentralization. Long-termism, a value that lies at the very heart of MakerDAO, is the most powerful moat. It is prudence that has enabled the protocol to retain and attract high-quality delegates, core contributors, and investors. Built into the long-term view is an aversion to risk and a focus on doing things the right way\u2014not cutting corners. The protocol never offered yield-farming incentives like its peers. The protocol never compromised its judiciousness in onboarding assets that backed the peg. We talk ad nauseum about how Terra is taking a myopic and unsustainable approach, yet are considering one for RWAs. Foregoing smaller short-term gains for much larger long-term gains is forged into the culture here. To not apply this same logic to RWAs would be antithetical to what got us here. Epilogue MakerDAO is, ultimately, still a venture-funded start-up in a fierce, adversarial space. To not grow is to die. In a rising rate environment, we\u2019ve been handed a golden opportunity to seize RWA market share. Let\u2019s pump the surplus buffer and tackle RWAs properly. Stay Frosty, Teej ",

I will be sending this around to my colleagues / friends in finance who are exploring DeFi as a funding mechanism for real-world asset deals. A few questions, if you have a moment:   You close by saying, \u201cMakerDAO is, ultimately, still a venture-funded start-up in a fierce, adversarial space.\u201d Are there any DeFi/crypto entities you see as competitors for these sorts of real-world asset transactions? Or, is this more about TradFi trying to keep control of the game?   Based on my read of recent MIPs, it seems that there is some discussion within your team regarding problems with the 6S Capital SPV-based structure. I assume the structure in question is what is documented here:      RWA Homepage    A Walkthrough of the 6s Capital Trust Structure\u00a0 \u2014 RWA Homepage DISCLAIMER    The content of this communication is for informational purposes only. You should not construe any information contained herein as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice. You should not rely on the information contained...

It seems that the loans are done off-chain, using normal legal agreements and \u201cnormal\u201d counterparties, but the money is exchanged on-chain in the form of DAI.  In your post, you wrote:   MakerDAO\u2019s RWA protocol is akin to a token bridge. Messages need to be shuttled between one consensus environment (the real world) to another (on-chain) and back.

Or, is this more about TradFi trying to keep control of the game?   Good question. I think there are two ways to approach the question. One is: Are there other protocols with a similar suite of characteristics to MakerDAO that might be considered competitors in bringing RWAs on-chain? Mainly no, though some folks at Frax and Rari are noodling with the premise. Terra, the protocol that is fundamentally most similar to MakerDAO, appears to be directing its collateralization efforts at purely crypto collateral. The other is: Will there be competition on the horizon to bring RWAs on chain? I think the answer here is indubitably yes, though we don\u2019t know what form that competition takes. The crypto market is small, the world of value huge. Entrepreneurs, whether inside of Maker or outside of it, will build this bridge over the next decade. My point regarding Maker\u2019s jostling for position was intended to juxtapose the largely risk-averse, central-bank like tone of the rest of the piece. Risk-aversion and long-termism are features of MakerDAO but we cannot sit on our hands and expect things to go our way. Crypto is a red queen scenario and to run at the same speed as everyone else is to go nowhere.  I would be keen to know what the problems were, and what the replacement might be, for those writing future proposals?  Ah I see you\u2019ve been in the weeds\u2026welcome to the undergrowth! Please see this post for some insight into how we, specifically @christiancdpetersen thinks about the conception of the 6S structure and the progress towards strengthening it. From my vantage point, and CP will correct me if I am wrong, there is nothing inherently wrong with the DST structure per se. Like any legal construct, it serves a particular purpose for particular scenarios. But the community really seems to have rallied around the DST as a panacea for MakerDAO RWA going forward. There are a bevy of real-world architectures  that enable MakerDAO to ingest assets lawfully and for token holders to interact with those assets. The appropriate structure will vary much depend on the jurisdiction (DST may not be all that helpful for Rwandan hydro assets), the asset type, and tax treatment, among other things.  Is there a roadmap to bring the actual loan docs into smart contract-based structures? Any breakdown on the parts of RWA transactions that happen off-chain, versus on-chain, and how this bridging is currently accomplished?  A lot of what is occurring now entails off-chain structures like trusts, trustees, and legal contracts. Ultimately, to access high-quality RWAs today, you must retrofit. Path dependencies are impossible to avoid and so we are navigating the incumbent systems to the best of our ability. With that said, Centrifuge (and some others) has been a pioneer in representing assets via on-chain tokens and we continue to look for ways to bring on-chain liquidity and transparency to the real world. As the sequence of the \u201cCase for Continuity\u201d suggest, I think we need to battle-test the pipes with some high quality assets and start driving real revenue to the protocol. Then, of course,  as we study the way these systems work in a more controlled environment, it is imperative that we look for ways to innovate: sever trust assumptions, execute legal contracts via smart contracts, bring censorship-resistant oracles into RWA valuations/liquidation proceedings etc. ",

Like any legal construct, it serves a particular purpose for particular scenarios. But the community really seems to have rallied around the DST as a panacea for MakerDAO RWA going forward. There are a bevy of real-world architectures that enable MakerDAO to ingest assets lawfully and for token holders to interact with those assets. The appropriate structure will vary much depend on the jurisdiction (DST may not be all that helpful for Rwandan hydro assets), the asset type, and tax treatment, among other things.   Correct. That is why we seek to identify key principles that we can apply across multiple jurisdictions.

This sounds promising.  Are you indicating that the interest rate Maker requires its borrowers to pay could be adjusted to incentivise behaviour that reinforces the mission of the community?  So in theory if certain targets (say around ESG) were being consistently hit by a borrower, they could be rewarded with a cut in their interest rate. Maybe you have some examples of where you think this could be a powerful tool to encourage a real world mission? ",

Many of us believe the only thing will drive good ecological/social outcomes is economic incentive and this does just that. If the community wanted to explore this, I think a combination of MakerDAO senior funding, Helium for connectivity, and Regen for verification is not impossible. These mechanism would of course verify ecological outcomes, not social ones. Rewarding the \u201cS\u201d of ESG is maybe an even more interesting design space. Not about IoT or sensors.

                    "content": "Hi @teej This:  \u201c\u2026RWA counterparties are alive and self-interested: they want the best terms for themselves and the worst terms for MakerDAO\u2026\u201d is perhaps oversimplifying the situation a bit. Have a think about this game mechanics: The \u201ccredit game\u201d, Maker generally is to play in RWA, is a case of infinitely repeating games between lender and borrower (first credit facility replaced by second ad infinitum)  with increasing payouts (increasing size of credit facility), with informational asymmetry during a specific game (borrower knows more than lender), but with credible sanctions for non-cooperation on the side of the lender at the end of each game (no further credit lines and broken market reputation). In addition there are material upfront investment requirements on both parties to start such a set of repeating games, which strongly discourages anybody entering this \u201ccredit game\u201d for a single game \u201cI win/you lose\u201d payout situation - which still would contain credible sanction options at the end of it (broken market reputation). In short: RWA counterparty self-interest does not equate to best terms for themselves and worst terms for MakerDAO. Rather, it equates to keeping the above cooperative set of repeating games alive by ensuring both parties are gaining appropriate results and maximising long-term multi-game increasing payout for both parties. And this credit game has a reasonably stable equilibrium of long-term win-win. In the particular case of Maker RWA onboarding, the upfront investments required by potential RWA counterparties are so high (actual cost, time, resources, forum interaction, potential reputational outcome, uncertain time-horizons etc) before any decision and any potential first dollar deployment, that the direct financial outcome of the \u201cfirst game\u201d is of somewhat limited consequences to the borrower - the only importance is the stream of increasingly larger payout games to come thereafter. This means that RWA counterparty should, if they understand the credit game, provide Maker particularly attractive terms in the first game, as this would be in their long-term self-interest. This dynamic exists to a certain degree also with Maker: large investments in onboarding a borrower. Here motivating for onboarding repeat and scalable game borrowers and seeking signals that shows the borrower will play according to the rules, be a repeat player and seek an appropriate win-win equilibrium. As a lender, you usually ensure your operations, interaction, agreements and deal-making is set up to encourage, and take advantage of, above game mechanics. It develops long-term relations to, and good behaviour in, your borrowers. You can only get so far with covenants and junior capital and other structural measures in defending against information asymmetry - you need this expected long-term relationship and expected repeating game mechanics to get the borrowers to tell you about issues before they blow up and get out of control and not hide them - and have the borrower doing so in the hope that honesty and collaborative troubleshooting of extraordinary circumstances will allow the games to repeat. In addition, of course, as a lender, you need long-term growing lender/borrower relationships to grow profitably. So, I\u2019d venture, if you setup the game mechanics right, you can have self-interest based actions of both parties conclude in long-term Win-Win situations for both parties. ",

I think most members of the community can only occasionally look into certain topics - as I do - , so many of us have a sense of lack. Think of it as an incomplete jigsaw puzzle with pieces that don\u2019t necessarily fit together. The only thing that fills in the gaps is the trust and faith that YOU - Whales, core unit members, delegates etc - all those who have worked here in the past and all those who are currently working for the future of the Maker, are doing and seeing something important, that our incomplete information puzzle does not show. Unfortunately, over time, transparency turns around and becomes opaque because of too much and fragmented information. It is impossible to keep track of everything just by taking time out of your free time. As protocol and the industry become more complex, this gap between us will continue to widen, an this can cause many problems. I think people are starved for summaries like this.
