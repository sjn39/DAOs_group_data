Now separate from the Weekly Relay with the objective to scale and improve all the information you need for your Dai escapades!

This update is for information and communication purposes only.  Hey, you! Yes, you. We asked. We still have a couple of questions! Very Short Feedback Survey   1782\u00d71230 225 KB   'Sellsius Monday\u2019s peg variance up close and personal. In yet another market panic, snap back to peg is swift.   Peg1780\u00d71252 256 KB   Zooming out, what\u2019s fascinating is the premium. DAI continues to be above rather than below peg as the sell-offs march towards goblin town. Macro sentiment is bold   24 hour versus 7 day1062\u00d7806 477 KB   Half a billion in volume on DEX venues. Max and Min 1.14 and .80, the same variance as less active weeks. Good to see that even in extreme times, overall, the peg mechanisms perform well.   Celsius whale stats2080\u00d7680 97.3 KB   Keeping perspective in check, Celsius does have its positions in healthy collateralization, though not from another 22% hit. Unless conspiracy is your thing  More on liquidation risk later.     DAI Supply2334\u00d71498 289 KB   TVL is down a billion and a half to 9.1. But there is more DAI supply at the time of writing than last week! Likely due to throughput from stables and a flight to safety. Overall, collateralization is floating very low. USDC in PSM is at 49%   Stablecoin balance1860\u00d7986 144 KB   Total stable coin balances are 4.6 billion.   Mins/burns1332\u00d71220 147 KB   More mints than burns this week, 13 million net.   Overall borrowers1318\u00d7810 63.6 KB   Overall, this week\u2019s borrowers bumped on Maker and Compound while Aave leveled off.  Visit Makerburn for an up-to-the-minute breakdown of changes, expenses, and Ilk updates.  Auctions totals998\u00d7758 338 KB   Auctions in the past few days are numbering 284, with 5.5 million sent to the surplus.   Keepers and takers tied986\u00d71072 76.9 KB   Keepers and Takers at 15, keeping auctions running smoothly. MakerDAO twitter breaking auctions down further: https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1536376851756630017    Keepers on long tail1994\u00d71364 330 KB   One thing to watch in turbulent markets is the keepers on long-tail assets. Some of the smaller DC collateral could be viewed as problematic. Auctions settling greater than an hour and fewer keepers make for stagnant markets. Not a huge problem! But definitely, something to keep in the hindbrain for onboarding new ilks.   Avergae auction2048\u00d7516 113 KB   Overall, though, auctions purring like an e39 M3. The average duration at 30 mins or less.   1072\u00d7580 352 KB   AAVE D3M balance is 76 million at the time of writing.   Vaults 7 day2056\u00d71584 334 KB   Weekly vault openi\u2026ok, fine, closing stats are stark. ETH-A and ETH-C take the largest losses in vaults.   OPen interest BTC2576\u00d71588 288 KB   Open interest in BTC is mostly on perps, Binance, FTX, and OKEx. Why write about BTC? Because liquidation cascades would hit our whales smack in the middle of this mess.  If you\u2019d like perspective, shoot, even Binance had to suspend Bitcoin operations for a bit due to faulty sats per byte on their transaction sends https://twitter.com/binance/status/1536398691602399232?s=21&t=weyUMSSwVrTh0RP5oSMeCw. Probably just bad timing for a hardware upgrade.  22% or more1238\u00d7920 112 KB   As we mentioned, a 22% drop would cascade debt pretty far up the liquidation mountain. 388 million.    So for your health, take a break once in a while and go outside. Go Build/learn something  twitter.com    q\u1d64\u1d62\u209c.\u209a\ua700\ua700.\u2091\u209c\u2095 @0xQuit  7/ and while everybody else panics over their bags. Put your head down and learn something new, or build something, or map out your plan for next cycle. I know it's been a while since it felt this way, but wagmi. I mean that.
