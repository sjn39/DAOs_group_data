                    "content": "   Introduction   Welcome to the first quarterly update covering Stakeholder Content at GovComms. Our Stakeholder Content program consists of several publications that summarize governance, forum activity, Dai performance, and Core Unit updates.  The program\u2019s vision is to provide relevant and informative content at a general level that a broad audience can easily understand. You may check out our program documentation that more comprehensively outlines all Stakeholder News and Reports. Each publication is produced through workflows involving the Content Lead and several contributors, enabling us to produce a substantial amount of weekly and monthly content. In addition to the Stakeholder News and Reports, GovComms Content performs public call transcriptions, video uploads, metric gathering & analysis, and Reddit moderation.   Summaries Team  Our Summaries Team performs transcriptions to promote transparency, archive-ability, and searchability of public information. The following chart depicts public calls transcribed and their contribution:  1600\u00d7888 124 KB     Stakeholder News & Reports   The Stakeholder News & Reports program began with only the Maker Relay, Forum at a Glance, Governance Review, and public call transcriptions. Eight months later, GovComm\u2019s content output has almost doubled. There are now five recurring publications with corresponding metrics reports and twelve public calls serviced with transcriptions or editorial summaries. Our contributor team has grown as well. What began with just a handful of part-time contributors under the Content Lead\u2019s management now includes a writer, an editor, a recognized delegate contributor, a Reddit moderator, seven summary team members, and one quality assurer, all of whom are part-time. The newest forms of heading and banner designs are made by Kat (thank you!) This brings our total part-time contributor count to thirteen people. The following chart depicts Stakeholder content published and their contribution:  991\u00d7619 39.4 KB  The last eight months have only been the beginning; we found our footing and built the GovComm\u2019s Stakeholder Content vision through our projects and workflow support structures. Now that the ball has been rolling, there is much more in store, not just for the content side of things but also for Governance Communications. Amount of work delivered during Q1 2022:  29 public call transcriptions 15 Weekly Relay publication 15 State of Dai publications 4 Governance and Risk Call summaries 3 Monthly Governance Summaries 3 Monthly Core Unit Updates 1 Piece on MakerDAO at ETHDenver   Below is a visual map detailing contributor involvement throughout the workflow of the program:  1600\u00d7925 166 KB  Context: \u201cFront-end\u201d defines actions and work that are very visible and public, such as posts, uploads, recaps, and more. \u201cBack-end\u201d defines actions and work that are also public but involve more planning, management, information collection, research, editing, and procedural work. This year\u2019s most notable changes include additional content publication, sharing,  and delegating more tasks to our part-time contributors. The delegation of projects and certain tasks allows the Content Lead more time to step back and focus on improving quality, scaling existing projects, training the team, and working on a strategy to level up the entire presentation, delivery, and production of Stakeholder Content.    Content Publications   Check out the Stakeholder Content | Overview document for the program\u2019s mission, vision, objectives, and roadmap.  Weekly Relay: Check out the Weekly Relay | Overview document for information on its mission, vision, objectives, roadmap, and process. Weekly Relay has been our most known publication because it was produced before the ratification of COM-001 and was integrated into our mandate from the beginning. The vision has been to create the MakerDAO stakeholder\u2019s primary source for \u201ceverything that happened in Maker this week.\u201d Artem, the Content Lead, and Ashton, our writer & editor, currently produce the Weekly Relay. After that, a quality check is performed, PDF documents are created, and finally, the publication is posted on various media platforms. OKRs:  1234\u00d71600 226 KB  Notable Q1 Completions:  Workforce cut by half while still improving quality of posts Added online .pdf links for mobile users and download lovers Onboarded Ashton and now working together on Weekly Relay and other publications Began posting WR on Medium every Tuesday morning Integrated more analytics such as average read time and engagement ratio Created the first Weekly Relay | Overview, which is now served as a template for future updates, quarterly reviews, and project documentation Improved the posted format into a more compact version using dropdown widgets and interactive icons   State of Dai: Check out the State of Dai | Overview document for information on its mission, vision, objectives, roadmap, and process. State of Dai was initially included in the Maker Relay prior to the ratification of COM-001. I believe it has the potential to scale into its unique publication providing analytical summaries of Dai activity. The state of Dai is currently produced by Recognized Delegate, Tim Black, and then reviewed and posted on forum and media platforms by Artem, the Content Lead. Additionally, there is a discussion on improving the State of Dai strategy and scaling it into a larger beast. OKRs:  1600\u00d71366 297 KB  Notable Q1 Completions:  Made State of Dai its own publication, separate from the Weekly Relay. Ashton is onboarded as an additional contributor. Development of a more actionable and clarified set of OKRs.   Forum at a Glance: Check out the Forum at a Glance | Overview document for information on its mission, vision, objectives, roadmap, and process. Forum at a Glance was passed down to us by GovAlpha during early Q4 of 2021. Since then, we have embraced this publication, developing a vision and improving it thanks to the feedback from several community members. Ashton and Artem currently create the Weekly Relay. After that, Artem performs a quality check, creates PDF documents, and posts them on our media platforms. OKRs:  1382\u00d71600 241 KB  Notable Q1 Completions:  Improved the posted format into a more compact version using dropdown widgets and interactive icons Added online .pdf links for mobile users and download lovers Expanded the comprehensiveness of FaaG into a TL;DR style summary Ashton was onboarded as a primary contributor Began posting FaaG on Medium every Tuesday morning Applied more analytics such as average read time and engagement ratio   Monthly Governance Review: Check out the Monthly Governance Review | Overview document for information on its mission, vision, objectives, roadmap, and process. The Monthly Governance Review was produced before the ratification of COM-001 and was integrated into our mandate. It is our more technical publication because it includes all governance-related votes, polls, and activity over the past month. Currently, only Artem writes the MGR, while David and/or Ashton perform quality assurance. Ashton will soon be trained to contribute to the MGR. OKRs:  1495\u00d71600 298 KB  Notable Q1 Completions:  Improved the posted format into a more compact version using dropdown widgets and interactive icons Added online .pdf links for mobile users and download lovers. Began posting MGR on Medium every Tuesday morning Applied more analytics such as average read time and engagement ratio Development of a more actionable and clarified set of OKRs.   Monthly Core Unit Updates: The monthly Core Unit Updates overview document and its OKR table will be available soon. This project was birthed through the discussion and community need for organization of all Core Unit and Team updates; there are many updates throughout the month, and several Core Units release an update every week. The MCUU was designed to improve searchability and ease of access to Core Unit Updates for each month. This project is relatively new and is still going through its initial kinks and quirks, but its potential is great, along with the services provided by SES and Growth. Overall, there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement. OKRs:  2000\u00d71552 266 KB  Notable Q1 Completions:  Created a tracking table of all Core Unit Updates, which is now delegated to one contributor Added online .pdf links for mobile users and download lovers, which also contains a semi-easy to navigate table of contents Added a shortlist table of all Core Unit Update links New: updated the format and post navigation to promote compact and quicker access to each update     Media Platform Review   Media Platform Docs Summary: Stakeholder Content is currently posted on Forum, Medium, Reddit, and Twitter. All of our content is first published to the Forum because this is where our active stakeholders spend the most time. We then publish to Medium, Reddit, and Twitter to better reach MakerDAO\u2019s less active stakeholders who are not present on the forum. Medium and Twitter are unique because we have created our own accounts that enable us to access better metrics we can analyze and build towards supporting the Stakeholder Content mission. These accounts are still fairly new and have undergone several strategy tests to improve audience engagement. Notable Q1 Completions:  Created our Medium account  Improved workflow for Twitter and Reddit Improved moderation, scheduled posts, post quality, and more cross-platform announcements   Metrics: Collecting metrics has probably been one of the most difficult tasks due to the inability to integrate Google Analytics into Twitter and Reddit without direct API access. Additionally, analytics provided on Discourse do not help us identify appropriate data and information to help strategically respond and improve published content. Medium, however, has some valuable metrics such as engagement rate and average read time. Twitter has lately improved its analytics system, which helps provide a little more information that can be valuable if used in conjunction with other metrics. Reddit metrics are only useful on a post-by-post basis because other members also utilize the subreddit; the account does not reflect the metrics of Stakeholder Content posts alone. Metrics collection is still a challenge that is being worked on. The following is a 28-day summary of GovComm\u2019s Twitter and Medium accounts using our updated posting strategy: Twitter:  1600\u00d7410 218 KB  Medium:  1600\u00d7659 97.6 KB  Additional documentation will be available soon. In the meantime, check out the Media Workflow Plan for some more information. Notable Q1 Completions:  Slightly improved audience reach by expanding to new platforms and increasing total Tweet impressions MoM by 191% Collected and published media platform metrics for Q3-Q4, 2021 Revised media strategy for Reddit and Twitter Utilized a time activity heat map by Reddit, engagement rate analytics from Medium, and more descriptive posts     Transcriptions Review  Onboarding and Training Call Summaries Tracker Call Summaries Overview  Summary:  Transcriptions are done for all recurring public calls recorded and posted on the MakerDAO YouTube channel. There have been minor improvements in the quality and process throughout the last several months; transcriptions are more aesthetically pleasing with the improved format, crosslinks, and timestamps separating discussion topics. Additionally, transcriptions have been optimized by implementing an AI speech-to-text software called Otter.ai (which is not perfect but helps reduce time spent during transcriptions), a public tracker sheet, and training a dedicated team of contributors for certain roles. We continue to reduce the time spent per transcription to reduce the cost per transcription summary. Notable Q1 Completions:  Improved workflow by reducing workforce hours while also improving quality Utilizing Otter.ai, YouTube chapters, and slides for improved performance Almost the entire summary process is now delegated to a set of contributors Discontinued Snippets in exchange for new Medium public call summaries      YouTube Uploads   I have recently taken oversight in uploading and slightly refining the Issue Discussion, Governance and Risk,, and other calls. Videos now contain navigatable chapters, an improved \u2018about\u2019 section, and a subscribe and playlist ending scene.    What\u2019s Ahead?   The following are Q2 soft objectives for GovComm\u2019s content as a whole:  Complete full documentation, overview, written strategy, and improved roadmap for all GovComm\u2019s Content work; three (of eight) projects remaining Begin publishing on substack and then Revue (Twitter) Contribute to and utilize the SES dashboard hub (for MCUUs) and Growth Twitter to help expand our reachable audience Delegate additional projects to contributors and have contributors begin posting on the forum Strategically interact more with the community, delegates, and other members to gather ideas, feedback, needs, and requests we can deliver Onboard an additional contributor for State of Dai who has experience in markets, DeFi economics, trading, and analytics  More objectives, tasks, and challenges are available within individual project drive folders and Overview documentation.
