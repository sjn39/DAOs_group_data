Anyways, hope this is helpful  It\u2019s great that the community is creating a Community Code of Conduct. Even cooler is that it\u2019 opt-in. When organizations and individuals buy-in they\u2019re doing so against the default. They\u2019re taking action. That\u2019s meaningful. I agree with everything in the doc and it all makes sense, except the part on Unwelcomed Behavior. This part is very vague. What is unpolite or unprofessional to one person might be honest to another. As Linus said \u201cOn the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle.\u201d Also, too often smart people will hide ill intent behind polite speech. They\u2019re very good at it. Also, sometimes those who are rough around the edges are the most caring. They say things that are less than eloquent, but have good intentions and honest feedback. They\u2019re willing to say the truth, and sometimes that\u2019s hard. The world isn\u2019t this black and white, but it\u2019s important to keep these things in mind. In the CoC doc there\u2019s a list of \u201cquestions to ask yourself.\u201d These are a good start, but I can see a whole host of situations where this could get complicated. Everything\u2019s relative. Human\u2019s operate on subjective viewpoints, but there\u2019s no global \u201ctruth\u201d. It comes down to how people feel. This is treacherous confusing territory. With these questions the goal seems to be to reduce drama and increase empathy? If so, here\u2019s a few more questions that have helped me avoid conflict and drama. These questions do not directly address more hostile forms of negative behavior. They address what often leads to conflict and drama: miscommunication. For me, thinking about incentives and playing to win a positive sum game is much easier and more compelling than thinking about \u201cfeelings.\u201d Here\u2019s a few ways I frame that: Am I playing a positive sum game?   Do I feel like it\u2019s a game of \u201cus/me vs them?\u201d If so, are there any ideas or solutions that would be a win/win?   Am I taking into consideration the interests of all parties involved, or just my own?   Am I talking about the person, or their ideas/actions?  It\u2019s always a good idea to be easy on people, but hard on ideas. Am I taking someone\u2019s criticism of my ideas as an attack on me as a person? If so, try re-reading/thinking about it, but imagining it\u2019s someone else\u2019s idea. Does it look different from that perspective?  Am I creating value?   If I am highlighting a problem, am I also proposing a solution? If so, is that solution supported by facts as well as feedback from the community? If not, am I seeking out feedback to create a win/win scenario or trying to sell people on my idea vs theirs?   If I am highlighting a problem, what would have to change for that to no longer be a problem. What needs to happen to make it better? Sharing this feedback with other party could help facilitate constructive conversations rather than being stuck in the land of opinions and emotions.   If I am proposing a solution, is it a solution for me or for all parties involved? If all parties involved would not be happy with this idea, is there a way to change it where they would be?   Are we talking about facts, or opinions?  Can I back my idea up with facts? If so, what are those? Share them. If not, why? More research would make for a more persuasive discussion. Can I argue for the other side of this issue as well, or do I only understand my own viewpoint?  I don\u2019t know much about Ethereum Magicians or rolling CoCs, but I hope this is helpful. Also, if this isn\u2019t the right place for feedback or this direction isn\u2019t useful please let me know!  ",

It would create an \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d group. Whether or not that\u2019s the intention, anything that allows for differentiation also allows for discrimination. What about a file in the repo like what Aragon did, or like the people who supported the Pitchforks are for hay not hate letter? You could even bake it into a smart contract. People would opt-in by sending a tx to the contract. The action shows they really care, it\u2019s publicly verifiable, and you can\u2019t sign someone up without their consent. It\u2019s also completely open so anyone can choose to join and contribute   It\u2019s essential to put thought into how disputes would be resolved. Otherwise at the first sign of trouble the entire system will devolve into a sea of confusion and frustration. If the system doesn\u2019t work, no one will trust it. It needs to work. Do you guys have any ideas how we could test that out? Like would we have to role play various scenarios in a red team / blue team game like the infosec community? lol  Also, glad my suggestions were helpful. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to put them in the main CoC doc, but they could become part of a supporting doc. That way if people opt-in to the CoC they\u2019ll have the latest CoC doc to refer to, but also a set of supplementary guides. These could include:  tips for conflict resolution, communication best practices, values the community shares, etc\u2026  The CoC says what not to do. The supplementary guides could provide suggestions on what to do. This would help cap the downside of negative behaviors, but also provide support and direction for positive growth.

I disagree. If both parties have agreed to the CoC they can go through arbitration. I think that this scenario will be unlikely given that the program is opt-in and the Ethereum community is rather large. Most people will follow the default. That means that if someone flags a comment for moderation, most likely the moderator will be limited to making suggestions to \u201cplay nice.\u201d At most the moderator could check the CoC for that communication channel or platform to see if it breaks any rules there. Essentially, I think that the CoC could serve to help educate and guide the community towards more respectful, constructive, and open dialog. I don\u2019t think that people rolling around with sheriff badges is going to go over well though.     consciousEntity:  I think the CoC needs to exist as a number of documents - the C-CoC itself, an implementation guide, and the \u201cQuestions\u201d section as a Guide to Good Behavior document or something.   Agreed. An implementation guide would be great because in this case \u201chow\u201d is a lot more complicated than \u201cwhat\u201d or \u201cwhy.\u201d Support docs around better communication tactics would be great too  ",

HackMD is good for early drafting but eventually it needs to get into better tools (and not even sure if GitHub is as good as others for policy work). I have created a GitHub repo for Integrity Ring projects, and the first piece of it is this CoC.

If the process is supposed to be community driven and open for anyone to collaborate on, wouldn\u2019t PRs to the repo make more sense? Then anyone can participate.

Otherwise people have to read through a huge comments thread just to know what\u2019s going on.

Perhaps general discussions could happen on the forum, but when someone wants to make a change they submit a PR to the repo along with an explanation as to why they think it\u2019s important.

What if the CoC was split into 2 sections: preventative and reactionary?   preventative: best practices for communication, collaboration, inclusive language, things to not do, etc\u2026   reactionary: how to ask for help, conflict resolution, consequences, etc\u2026   Here\u2019s my thinking. The whole thing is opt-in and volunteer based, so it\u2019s not a binding legal agreement. Even if it was, the community is globally decentralized so it would be unrealistic to try enforce. This means that we can\u2019t do much after the fact when things don\u2019t go well. The purpose of the CoC is to make the community safer, more diverse, and more collaborative. The best way to create that is via preventative measures and education. Also, people generally react well when you make their experiences better, but react poorly when you try to tell them what to do. We might get a higher ROI by cultivating the positive aspects of the community rather than trying to enforce rules or arbitration. It\u2019s still important to have \u201crules\u201d and consequences, but there\u2019s a lot more we can do to create a better experience for everyone. ",
