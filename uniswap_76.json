Brother Blec is no doubt a very prominent figure in the DeFi community, thanks to his (warm)takes and skeptical attitude. Say what you want about him, but I think it would benefit all of us if he was gone.(Especially if you are an underage dev) Thankfully, Blec has given us a wonderful opportunity to make this happen: just give him 50 million dollars. With the Uniswap treasury holding almost $4B, and considering even our lord and savior Hayden Adams has voiced his disdain for Mr. Blec, I propose we go ahead and give him the $50M in UNI tokens. Link to snapshot poll: link Voting ends in a week or so. ",

I will save puppies and kitties and babies with my money.    I will live my life richly and thoroughly until someone has decided that my actions, whether laudable or detestable or in-between are worthy of that $50 million dollars\u2026  and we can all be grateful that I didn\u2019t ask for the money on twitter after accumulating some noteworthiness in the crypto community, but by being a person of little significance who showed up one day and replied to a rather extraordinarily sarcastic comment!  Why grateful, you might be asking?  I saved you from thousands of comments and interactions just by going straight for the cash!  Pay me for all the time I previously was not involved with DeFi and other such things!  (Also, the kitties & puppies & babies I might save!)  It will be grand!   50000 grand to be exact! ",
