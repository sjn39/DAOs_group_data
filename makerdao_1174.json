Say for instance, just swapping the collateral for DAI using uniswap. Presumably an alternative system could be conceived where the protocol makes use of the liquidity of these decentralized exchanges until it is exhausted before having to fall back and actually trigger an auction. Curious if this has been discussed in the past. What are the potential downsides that i am not considering? Would we ever consider making use of the other defi projects in order to improve liquidation efficiency or mitigate liquidation risks? Would also love to hear any alternative liquidation systems that we believe might also be an improvement on what we have today. ",

Is this really a problem if the default is to fall back to flip auctions if there is not sufficient liquidity? For these large CDPs we could just fall-back to the system as currently implemented. Second thought on this. How big of a problem is this really? There is currently about 1.5MM dai in uniswap. How many CDPs are there out there with a dai debt > 1.5MM? Some probably but is this 10% of the vaults or is this 50% of vaults. Also it seems to me that the larger CDPs are going to be less likely to get liquidated anyway since they stand to have a lot more to lose. ",

If someone can do better than the market they win the auction but the auction defaults to selling on a secondary market.   After giving this a bit more thought it is a bit unclear to me how you might go about implementing this. One thought i had would be to set up a keeper that could place an initial bid based on the uniswap price. I see 2 problems with this: 1 where will it get the DAI for it\u2019s initial bid? 2 what happens if the uniswap price drops before the auction is over. Ignoring the problems in #1 you would run the risk of the price dropping below the price floor before the auction is finished. Potentially you might have the the keeper bid something like 1/2 the uniswap price which could probably save you as long as the current volatility wasn\u2019t too high but the risk would still be present. Again it seems more straight forward and less risky to me for the flip contract to just check the exchange liquidity for DAI / collateral price and immediately liquidate when kick is called by the cat contract. That is supposing that there is sufficient liquidity to cover the tab. If not it would emit the kick event and the auction would begin same as it does today. Maybe i just have a lack of imagination here on how you might be able to implement this. Any thoughts on how the cat / flipper contracts might be modified to ensure a floor price for the auction? ",

You may also be able to setup some sort of throttling mechanism to mitigate these concerns. The flipper could potentially check the throttle before deciding to offload the collateral onto the exchanges. Potentially this could be implemented by some token bucket type solution but there might be a better throttling algorithm. Maybe count on the MKR holders to decide the token bucket parameters like burst size and average rate. concerning specifically:     IslandHunting:  You can\u2019t just dump millions of ETH onto DeFi exchanges and get a result that is even close to OK.

I\u2019ve talked a bit previously about changes that i believe could be made to the deal function . Perhaps the deal function only attempts to offload the collateral to the DeX if the bid is say < 50% of the osm price. This should still leave the keepers plenty of opportunity to buy discounted collateral without allowing them to bid $0 for it.     latetot:  The only problem last time was failure to adjust gas prices and not enough of them around.   This is kind of what i am saying about making the bid ttl a dynamic value. If we can detect network congestion then we might be able to use it to raise the auction duration in times of stress. This might give the keepers the ability/time to compensate to extreme conditions without forcing the tau and ttl values to just be set to extremely high levels which is also a concerning state of affairs.
