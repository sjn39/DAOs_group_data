People seem to think that the amount of resources available on the network (particularly hard drive space) is infinite, and given recent discussions re: rent, I think this is obviously not the case. If the ethos of the community was that an EIP must be not only useful and needed, but it also must be _and efficient, and not destroy the network if it succeeds. I\u2019ll probably make this PR soon, but I thought I\u2019d see what other thinks first.
