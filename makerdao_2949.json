                    "content": "Over the past few weeks the SourceCred working group has been debating whether to increase weekly payouts from 2,500 DAI to 5,000 DAI. We\u2019ve now decided to go ahead and increase the payout to 5,000 DAI per week, starting in December. We feel this is a benefit for the following reasons:  Additional Signups We are seeing additional users sign-up for the initiative, and more users means the payouts are split between more people, reducing the average payout.  Small Portion of Protocol Income 5,000 DAI/week is still an insignificant fraction of the total current income of the Maker Protocol (even excluding stablecoins, but may make a meaningful difference to the amount of time contributors feel they can spend on Maker. With 250k per week of non-stablecoin income, at 5,000 DAI per week, this comes to 2% of the Maker Protocol\u2019s income. Note that for the time being, this continues to be paid by the Maker Foundation.  Growth Growth of the DAO is a key goal at the moment. Having more community members gives the protocol a larger pool of potential talent that may be willing to work more formally for the DAO.  Experimentation Using SourceCred in MakerDAO is still considered to be in a trial phase, experimenting with the total payout will hopefully allow us to better set the payout amount when / if the DAO is paying for SourceCred with funds from the Maker Protocol. Edit: Forgot to add, this starts in December. ",

Not really an issue, but don\u2019t know how to phrase it.    MIP13c3-SP6: SourceCred Funding   But then my question is: How does that work for other users. Let\u2019s take my example  You spend A LOT of time reading posts. You vote to all polls. But you don\u2019t really write comments/topic. Mainly because people already do it very well. You are still very important for the DAO, and you participate very carefully. But how this is taken into account ?   I also saw a topic to reward users when they voted. I think it\u2019s also a good idea. But you also don\u2019t want people to vote randomly to received rewards. To be honest i thinks it\u2019s very hard to find a perfect solution. I also think that people very involved in the governance and spending working almost full time on it, should have a special status and be paid by the governance. As is it done on several others DAO.

One potential issue is that much of your Cred was earned while you were working for the Foundation. Because the original motivation behind not including Foundation members was to avoid double paying (which some in the community thought unfair), paying the full catchup payment would likely contain some double pay. Due to the nature of the algorithm and payout mechanism, separating out Cred and DAI earned in different time periods can be tricky\u2026 This is a problem we need to solve though. Raising this issue with the SourceCred working group and will keep you posted. ",

Medium \u2013 13 Sep 19    The DAO Missing Link: Reputation Protocols It\u2019s time to call it. 2019 is indeed the year of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The term DAO, once tainted by the\u2026 Reading time: 10 min read           David_Meister:  doing it manually is likely way more effort and chaos that it is worth, and then who pays for the people reviewing \u2018quality\u2019\u2026 do we use kleros?   For now, I think the algorithm is doing a good job just using data from platforms (Discourse, Discord, GitHub, etc.). But as we try to fill in gaps not captured by those platforms (e.g. project management, emotional labor, leadership, etc.), we are likely going to need higher-level governance mechanisms, essentially, to reach consensus and resolve disputes. It\u2019s going to be a challenge to keep the neutrality (hopefully credible ) we have now. GitCoin is working on a SourceCred plugin      David_Meister:  as long as the algorithm doesn\u2019t encourage low effort \u2018me too\u2019 spam, it\u2019s pretty crazy that the opportunity even exists to reward people directly for real $, could you even imagine what would need to happen to do this in a \u2018traditional\u2019 way with bank accounts etc.?

The way it works currently, we invoice the Foundation for the prior month\u2019s rewards, then once we have the funds process the payouts manually. Iirc, we invoice monthly because we\u2019re part of the Foundation\u2019s monthly billing cycle for other grants and expenses (we\u2019re still funded by a dev grant). Just to be extra careful with large amounts of money, the internal process on our end is fairly manual and tedious. We are building some automation into instances including storing ETH addresses in the ledger, and if our Declaration of Intent funding MIP passes, the plan is to revisit funding before we begin our six month march to a protocol integration. So weekly payouts could become more feasible soon. ",
