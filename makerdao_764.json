It garnered a lot of discussion around the Oracles, and I\u2019m more than happy to answer any questions. The Oracle Governance Framework draft will be published in the forum by the end of next week so the community can start giving feedback and iterating on the document. There will be a review period of two weeks, before it will go to a Governance Polling Vote. I\u2019ve posted the presentation in PDF form below so there\u2019s a public record.   drive.google.com    Oracles Governance Feb 2020.pdf Google Drive file.       ",
