                    "content": "@loredanacirstea thanks for kicking this off. To recap, in the linked GitHub issue, several of us suggested that more process wasn\u2019t needed, but rather just doing the work of regularly reviewing EIPs & ERCs.  Basically, I believe the issue is actually recruiting knowledgeable people and asking them to commit time to do the work \u2014 not handing someone a title. If there were a line up of people begging for editor titles and/or tons of people consistently reviewing \u2014 this might be needed. If it were me, I would put effort into recruiting more people rather than adding process that it\u2019s unclear what it solves. That\u2019s my 2gwei. Good luck!  Here are some quick thoughts on ideas that might grow participation / how to participate more: Subscribe to new GitHub issues / PRs by \u201cWatching\u201d Leave a comment saying \u201cI\u2019m reviewing\u201d  this lets people know if anyone is working on a particular EIP  Run \u201cwhat is an EIP / how do EIPs work\u201d sessions at various conferences.  Any in person conferences and Hackathons are good times for this  Hold a weekly EIP review / edit session  Pick a time, gather in the EIPs Gitter Post chats as you edit / Review Have one or more existing editors there to approve PRs and do issue management  Run a weekly review of new EIPs  post them here and on Twitter  Use GitHub issues for more categorization:  if the current repo maintainers want to add new people (essentially more editors), then labels and other GitHub features could be used.  Related \u2014 I still have a PR in to add a full RSS feed of all EIPs. That handles them when they hit Draft on the website, not when they first get added to GitHub. Anyway, the main thing is getting more humans involved. The bar for helping to correct EIPs into Draft is quite low. The next step of reviewing the technical content is probably about cross posting an announce here to the forum and promotion. Also: I think Core EIPs have way different issues, so a lot of this mainly applies to ERCs. ",

Can I add that: It seems according to this issue comment  that \u201cEditor to check technical soundness\u201d is not a consensus. Then can I say that at least \u201csomeone\u201d(or some defined or undefined group of people) have to check / vet on technical soundness of an EIP - (is that a consensus?). If that\u2019s a case, we might also need to add a role / rule for checking that. I propose, for tech soundness, if at least one EIP-final status author of same category step up and say LGTM for the technical soundnesss, and within the time range of last call no obligations, it\u2019s being considered technically sound. If people have no consensus in technical soundness, then it blocks the Final-status bit until a technical soundness consensus (similar to how Wikipedia gets consensus check is reached. ",
