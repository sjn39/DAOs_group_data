                    "content": "The first real world asset went live on Maker almost a year ago. The first DAI backed by RWA was minted by New Silver in April 2021. Since then we have been continuously improving the technology and the legal structure. We continue to work with the RWF Core Unit (thanks to @christiancdpetersen and @eumenes!) on structures both for US based issuers like the ones live today as well as an off-shore structure based in Jersey. In this post we want to share progress on the legal structure for US-based assets. The Jersey structure is a collaboration with RWF Core Unit and Nebula Capital, a MIP6 application we are very excited about. We will introduce it in a later post. In this update we explain the basic principles of how we expect that this structure will work in the future. This structure will provide formalization for our pool transactions. This upgrade is intended to better protect the interest of investors and the DAO. The two key changes to highlight are:   We are proposing that issuers will appoint a third party trustee to act on behalf of the DAO and other investors. The trustee will be able to protect the interests of the DAO and ensure independent control of the assets. It would also handle distributions in case of default leaving it no longer in control of the issuer or a liquidator. We are in initial discussions with some potential trustees.   The second proposed change is the introduction of a lock-box. A lock-box is a term of art meaning a segregated account for assets held outside the control of the issuer and the SPV. This structure means that the SPV assets are no longer in control of the issuer but in control of the trustee. It will be the role of the trustee to receive and handle payments to and from the lock-box and make sure the right parties (for example Maker) receive the payments. This means the issuer doesn\u2019t control the funds from the borrowers to the Maker vault, reducing the risk of loss of funds or misuse of funds by the issuer.   This setup is intended to better protect investors and issuers from potential litigation claims and provides a consistent and coherent story for discussions with regulators and third party service providers such as custodians and banks. This type of structure is well established in the industry and accepted by many TradFi players. Using this structure should make it easier to bring TradFi players into DeFi which will expand the types and quantity of real world assets available to Maker, which we think is a key step to reducing the volatility of DAI. The schematic shared below (thanks to @christiancdpetersen) is a work in progress with the RWF Core Unit with support provided by Shearman & Sterling as engaged by the RWF CU as counsel, along with Manatt as Centrifuge\u2019s counsel.  Credit to @christiancdpetersen Some of the different pieces in the diagram to highlight are:  The lock-box arrangement ringfences the payments so these are not subject to the possible insolvency of the SPV. The use of a trustee better protects the interests of the investors and provides recourse in case of default. The pledges in favor of the trustee remove bankruptcy risk with respect to the underlying assets.  We remain committed to coming up with a robust legal structure to ensure that the DAO\u2019s interests are protected while growing the presence of diversified RWA as collateral. Please join us next week on Wednesday February 23 5pm UTC at our community AMA call where we will share more about the legal update, and why on-chain securitization matters with other members of the Centrifuge team. We look forward to your participation and questions, and meeting all of you! ",

The original Centrifuge model (and this update) contemplates that DROP and TIN Tokenholders will execute a subscription agreement for acquisition of the tokens. We added the layer of the indenture plus trustee to ensure that there was an independent third party in the real world that could take instructions from the DROP and TIN token holders as and when required under the indenture. Both the subscription agreement and the indenture plus trustee layer required a trusted legal entity (8). For purposes of the subscription agreement and the indenture, the trusted legal entity (8) will be the DROP Token holder. As a practical matter, however, the DROP Token will be deposited in the Maker vault. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any doubts. This is an iterative process, so questions are welcomed as we continually refine the implementation. ",

If there is no broker/dealer involved on the auctions, can you or your counsel from Sherman explain why not?

While I would love to see a future of liquid secondary markets for RWAs that are on Centrifuge this is not the reality yet today. This structure does not liquidate tokens by auctioning them off on chain but instead off chain payments from the borrowers are used to repay Maker if it wanted to \u201cliquidate\u201d the vault. This is also how all other RWA vaults under consideration from Maker are structured. In the long term if we see secondary markets of RWA backed tokens by Centrifuge then I think we would have to revisit your question. ",
