                    "content": "Launched on April 9, it is the first stablecoin to replicate the U.S. consumer price index (CPI). The Frax Price Index is a brand new, unique protocol within the Frax ecosystem. Centered around its own native stablecoin (FPI) and governance token (FPIS), the system will adjust every month according to an on-chain Consumer Price Index oracle so that holders of the FPI will increase their dollar-denominated value each month according to the reported CPI increase. It does this by earning yield on the underlying FPI treasury, created from users minting and redeeming FPI with FRAX. The Frax Price Index Share (FPIS) token is the governance token of the system, which is also entitled to seigniorage from the protocol. Excess yield will be directed from the treasury to FPIS holders, similar to the FXS structure. During times in which the FPI treasury does not create enough yield to maintain the increased backing per FPI due to inflation, new FPIS may be minted and sold to increase the treasury. Since the protocol is launched from within the Frax ecosystem, the FPIS token will also direct a variable part of its revenue to FXS holders. Inflation Calculation The FPI uses the CPI-U unadjusted 12 month inflation rate reported by the US Federal Government: Consumer Price Index Summary - 2022 M04 Results A specialized Chainlink oracle commits this data onchain immediately after it is publicly released. The FPI peg tracks the above 12 month inflation rate and pegs to it at all times from the FPI redemption contract. Thus, when buying FPI stablecoins for another asset (such as ETH) the trader is taking the position that CPI purchasing power is growing faster over time than the sold ETH. If selling FPI for ETH, then the trader is taking the position that ETH growth is outpacing the CPI inflation rate of the US Dollar.  FPI_FPIS1725\u00d7423 37.6 KB  It is as fragile as FRAX, it is like an extension of FRAX, since it is 100% backed by FRAX, and FRAX is 89.25% collateralized by different assets, and the other 10.75% algorithmically, it is not over-collateralized like Dai.  FRAX collateral860\u00d7424 23.8 KB   FRAX1725\u00d7424 52.5 KB  I would love to see Dai come out with their version in a much more robust form, it would be the best crypto hedge ideal for these times of financial uncertainty. The problem is how to apply it without damaging or unsettling some nuts and bolts of the Maker system and then harming us in the future. ",

The fact of creating a stablecoin that does not need to back 100% of its reserves to remain stable is a risky bet, but if it succeeds it could mark a path for other projects. However, it will have to be seen whether the structure based on partial collateralization is able to maintain the stability of the currency when they start handling large volumes of market capitalization at the level of today\u2019s consolidated stablecoins.
