                    "content": "I think there are two conversations that are worth having and we should be wary of separating them.  Budget Service  As @Doo_StableLab mentions above, we should separate the budget from the service in a first instance. I cannot really comment on the quality of the service or applicability to Maker. Would defer in this instance to @sidestream-core-unit @Protocol-Engineering @Risk-Core-Unit to comment. Of course, this value - now and in the long-term - is an important question as it will influence the expected return on the ongoing investment that is requested.  Budget and Vendor vs Core Unit Clearly, some functions (many of which are represented as CUs already, and many which might not be yet) need ongoing operational expense to keep the lights on and grow the protocol. However, I believe Maker in its current form has two key structural features that make it unsuitable to onboard Core Units over vendors in most instances.  Maker has operating leverage more similar to a small business than a SaaS company with steady recurring revenues  As a protocol, Maker alternates between accumulating capital in bountiful harvests and spending down its earnings in droughts It therefore faces quite large investment horizon uncertainty   MKR holders face adverse selection when evaluating a new Core Unit onboarding proposal  There is no alignment on what investments are desirable or appropriate  There is no agreement or consensus to what strategy or business practices are appropriate (Constitution, Public Good Purpose or whatever you want to call it) There is no independent body that can supervise Core Units and investment performance accountable to MKR holders (Council, Budget Allocators or whatever you want to call it) Edit: Will add that this also makes it really hard for prospective CUs or service providers to understand what it is that the DAO would like to be delivered thanks @retro    Applying Core Units have every incentive to maximize the fixed investment in their Core Unit  MKR holders do not have the time or bandwidth to evaluate every request holistically Applying Core Units have more information than MKR holders about the suitability of a team for onboarding  Businesses that apply as Core Units are only incentivized to increase the size of the retainer to subsidize the rest of their business (caution: not suggesting this is the case for Chaos Labs, and will always evaluate proposals in good faith - I am only pointing out what I believe are the natural incentives in the current structure)        Let\u2019s assume project X could be done either by a vendor in 12 months or by an onboarded Core Unit in 9. The vendor charges $100k upfront with $10k in annual maintenance therafter, the onboarded Core Unit costs $100k a year. Project X individually is clearly cheaper when run through the Core Unit ($75k vs $100k) and will probably be a better product. However, the value capture risk from the Core Unit is in ongoing and indefinite maintenance expenses that add operating leverage. If maintenance or other new projects don\u2019t fill the Core Unit\u2019s bandwidth, the protocol is essentially losing money and keeping the Core Unit is destroying capital. The counter argument is that this Core Unit could be offboarded. However, there is a behavioral kink to this where Core Units can argue, make the case to stay, reduce their run-rates, ask for exit bonuses to soften the landing or simply make off with funds (like Content Production). Therefore there is more friction than it might seem from the outset to plainly offboarding a CU so this mechanism is not as efficient as it might seem. Incentives through MKR vesting do not really address this issue either as they are only time-dependent and, truly, Maker could ask/force vendors to accept payment in wholly or partly in MKR to be properly aligned. Once in a situation of overinvestment, especially for a drought/harvest cycle type business, there are only two ways out of having built operational bandwidth too big for the business:  Fill the pipe Shrink the operations   Disadvantages of Vendors for Maker Contracting is useful, hard and expensive. The same structural features that make onboarding new CUs difficult for Maker atm apply to vendor selection and competitive RFQ processes. Furthermore, many vendors have fixed costs of their own to cover and will rarely be fully variable. Finally, the more customized and specific the project, the closer it starts to look like in-house work but just more expensive. This could be mitigated by seeking off-the-shelf solutions to the extent possible and limiting investment outlays where not. Sequencing investments in stages and milestones would ringfence the capital at risk working to develop any given projects regardless of its size.  Proposed Mental Model for Vendor vs Core Unit In the absence of a structured strategy (see above, Constitution/Purpose/Council/Allocators) to determine what services may or may not be suitable for Maker, I have a feeling the protocol is best served by approaching new service proposals in limited, SPF-style investments that can limit the total outflow and evaluate businesses more competitively. The scalable approach is to minimize in-housing until you reach a point where the margin capture benefit from in-housing is larger than the increase in ongoing fixed costs.  Tangible Feedback for Chaos Labs Sorry to dump this on Chaos Labs. I really do not mean this to be a specific comment on this particular MIP. What would be a shame is that in the fright of budget pressures (relating to the stage of drought/harvest we are in right now) we dismiss perfectly good contributors and services that could be helpful when market conditions recover. Defer to technical colleagues for this. That being said, what might be helpful to address my remark and some of the earlier comments in the thread is to see a side-by-side of what it might look like to rely on Chaos Labs through a vendor-retainer model rather than being onboarded completely as a Core Unit. In this light, a staggered rollout over time could be made more explicit - perhaps starting with fewer or no dedicated resources followed by a gradual ramp up of resources in sync with the market. This could show understanding of the situation Maker is in at the moment and demonstrate willingness to get a foot in the door over a take it or leave it approach with a fully ramped up spending run-rate. It could also show that for the importance and value of the service provided, the ongoing fixed operating cost is more attractive than a vendor-retainer model. ",

                    "content": "Maybe this should be split off in its own topic. We can add cross-reference links. Some good points made by @adcv. I want to note that many of the issues (barring the dire budgetary situation at the moment), come from missing process or governance structure.  Adding the Decentralized Perspective With the right structures in place, it should be possible to have a \u201cbring your own project\u201d relationship with vendors. But then the DAO needs the checks in place to better assess proposals and do quality control on the work. This is one of the strengths of open and decentralized organizations that we have not unlocked yet. Another neglected strength of decentralized organizations is adding competition to the mix. Instead of simply offboarding CUs, maybe we should consider to bring better alternatives to the table? If there is another team that can deliver the same or more for less money, then that should be preferred. This is much more difficult if the vendor-relationship is part of the black-box of a core unit. I want to add the link to my own write-up, further making the case why core units often do make sense as a vehicle to structure business relationships:     MIP39c2-SP24: Adding Immunefi Security Core Unit - IS-001 Archive       There are a number of reasons why it\u2019s preferred to have teams for business partnerships, even if they\u2019re just small like the Immunefi CU, onboarded into the DAO. This is important so I want to call them out.  As a starting point, a couple of observations:  A/ MakerDAO\u2019s Moats  MakerDAO has 3 long-term moats that protect the project from being forked gratuitously, i.e. copy/paste vampire attacks. They are    vesting / locked up MKR which give participants a stake in the game and provide incenti\u2026      Standardizing Decentralized Operations through Common Infrastructure Another important point I want to add is that leaving the responsibility of a coherent strategy to core units, for example in the case of security or testing, is bound to fail due to diffusion of responsibilities. This is a very simple mechanic: every core unit will have their own preference for which vendor to select and how much to pay for which services. As a result, there is no standardization, no transparency, no efficiency gains from sharing context and work. In the same way that one works with Notion, another with Google Docs, and yet another with Office365, so will the security and QA strategy be fractured and leaky. This is the reason why shared infrastructure is so important: if there is a preferred platform to work with, the expectation will grow that core units will use it. And that\u2019s how part of our coordination problems get solved: core units act independently but they interact transparently through the common infrastructure.  Crossing Deserts without Water Reservoirs The other big discussion that we need to have is this one:     adcv:  Once in a situation of overinvestment, especially for a drought/harvest cycle type business, there are only two ways out of having built operational bandwidth too big for the business:  Fill the pipe Shrink the operations    This poses tremendous challenges on an operational level. If we will insist to run break-even even during the worst bear markets, it\u2019s always going to hurt us badly. And it will clearly lead to sub-optimal performance. I don\u2019t believe this is necessary if we build up enough buffers. MakerDAO should be targeting an operational runway buffer that lengthens during bull markets and slowly shortens during bear markets. Break-even can then become a target at some point when the buffers are running dry. ",

                    "content": "Appreciate the spirited conversation here and wanted to take the opportunity to respond to everyone who has posted their thoughts / concern about Chaos Labs as a Core Unit and the work that we have and will do with the key maintainers of the MakerDAO protocol. In response to some of the primary concerns raised thus far, I want to break down my response (and thus segment the conversation) into two very distinct questions:   Vendor vs. Core Unit  What is the most appropriate structure for MakerDAO to work with third party companies who have additional, non-MakerDAO customers? What is the appropriate budget hold for those engagements?    Chaos Labs value  What can Chaos Labs & simulation testing do for MakerDAO? How can Chaos Labs work with other Core units and where is it additive vs. redundant (specifically with Risk)?     Vendor vs. Core Unit One thing I want to open up with is that Chaos Labs is in it for the long haul. MakerDAO was the company\u2019s first customer and is a community we have the utmost respect for as a steward of innovation and risk management in DeFi. We believe that the Core Unit process and structure is an ideal fit for how we want to work with the community, but also understand it is not the only option. Take this message as a commitment from me on behalf of the Chaos Labs team that we want to be engaged with Maker and flexible in working with the appropriate stakeholders on the tradeoffs from structure to budget. If other Core Units and the broader community find value in what Chaos Labs brings to the table, we will work in good faith to find the right way to build this engagement to continue earning the trust of the DAO and make sure we can support the relevant Core Units with infrastructure and tooling to enhance their capabilities to fulfill their respective missions. I know this thread and proposal is sparking a debate that is much larger than Chaos Labs specifically, but @adcv\u2019s post sheds a light on both the varying views of community disagreement as well as the confusion to an outside party into how to best engage with the DAO. While in the SES incubation program, the primary route forward was to become a Core Unit, but we\u2019ve never shied away from discussing / exploring a different structure (i.e. MIP55 SPF) if the community decided it made more sense.     adcv:  Disadvantages of Vendors for Maker Contracting is useful, hard and expensive. The same structural features that make onboarding new CUs difficult for Maker atm apply to vendor selection and competitive RFQ processes. Furthermore, many vendors have fixed costs of their own to cover and will rarely be fully variable. Finally, the more customized and specific the project, the closer it starts to look like in-house work but just more expensive. This could be mitigated by seeking off-the-shelf solutions to the extent possible and limiting investment outlays where not. Sequencing investments in stages and milestones would ringfence the capital at risk working to develop any given projects regardless of its size.   The primary goal of Chaos Labs as a company is to build scalable and flexible software for our customers to use in order to create agent- and scenario-based simulations for more robust economic testing and understanding. For larger institutions and DAOs, to get the most of this platform you will need to spend precious engineering and data science hours defining the scenarios you want to test (different attack vectors, price drops, on-chain conditions, and environments) as well as formally defining what insights you want to target, measure and learn from (account balances, smart contract triggers, etc.). The analogy I\u2019ve used throughout this process is to look to pre-existing Enterprise SaaS contracts and re-interpret them for DAOs. The question I posed on Twitter regarding this topic was \u201cAt what point is a vendor\u2019s services so widely used / mission critical that it\u2019s ROI+ for the DAO to have dedicated resources optimizing that external environment for their needs (a la salesforce engineers in a sales org)?\u201d By allocating budget for dedicated headcount, MakerDAO is bringing the expertise of these simulations, the most important scenarios for testing, as well as Chaos Labs expertise in house to make sure that the tooling they use is best suited for their specific needs. This would allow for the benefits of the tooling to be maximized by the end users (i.e. Sidestream, Collateral Onboarding, Risk, etc.) while the set-up and maintenance is not a cognitive overhang.  image1692\u00d7820 55.2 KB  Secondly, I want to piggyback on @wouter\u2019s \u201ccommon infrastructure\u201d theory:    Chaos Labs - Community Update & Call - July 08 at 14:30 UTC   Standardizing Decentralized Operations through Common Infrastructure Another important point I want to add is that leaving the responsibility of a coherent strategy to core units, for example in the case of security or testing, is bound to fail due to diffusion of responsibilities. This is a very simple mechanic: every core unit will have their own preference for which vendor to select and how much to pay for which services. As a result, there is no standardization, no transparency, no efficiency gains from sharing context and work. In the same way that one works with Notion, another with Google Docs, and yet another with Office365, so will the security and QA strategy be fractured and leaky. This is the reason why shared infrastructure is so important: if there is a preferred platform to work with, the expectation will grow that core units will use it. And that\u2019s how part of our coordination problems get solved: core units act independently but they interact transparently through the common infrastructure.   As I outlined in our update call last week, our aim as a Core Unit would be to build a unified testing platform for all core units and the community:  image2000\u00d71104 180 KB  This means that there is an independent, Maker-prioritized body that is developing this infrastructure from a holistic point of view so that it is functional for each Core Unit individually, but also accessible across them interchangeably. If SAS is testing new Auction mechanisms, should those simulations trigger different alerts/outputs for the Risk team to understand how what is being developed for one team impact another? By integrating this process (economic & simulation testing broadly) into the MakerDAO structure we can create more transparency both between CUs and the community to understand not only the security and side effects of new proposals, but the trade-offs made during development. With each Core Unit treating Chaos Labs as an external vendor, it\u2019s more likely than not that each Core Unit will operate in a siloed environment with minimal standardization and testing communication. Budget We proposed a budget that would scale with the needs of the DAO utilizing the platform over time. We have no problem initiating the relationship with the starting budget (subscription + 3 heads) and using the other period budgets (scaling to 7 heads) as an indication of expectations that can be implemented based on future MIP approval once traction and value is proved. Starting point And to @adcv\u2019s final point (which ties nicely to the question from @psychonaut):     adcv:  Tangible Feedback for Chaos Labs Sorry to dump this on Chaos Labs. I really do not mean this to be a specific comment on this particular MIP. What would be a shame is that in the fright of budget pressures (relating to the stage of drought/harvest we are in right now) we dismiss perfectly good contributors and services that could be helpful when market conditions recover. Defer to technical colleagues for this. That being said, what might be helpful to address my remark and some of the earlier comments in the thread is to see a side-by-side of what it might look like to rely on Chaos Labs through a vendor-retainer model rather than being onboarded completely as a Core Unit.

This could show understanding of the situation Maker is in at the moment and demonstrate willingness to get a foot in the door over a take it or leave it approach with a fully ramped up spending run-rate. It could also show that for the importance and value of the service provided, the ongoing fixed operating cost is more attractive than a vendor-retainer model.   I\u2019ll reiterate what I stated above: becoming a Core Unit is not the end all be all. We believe in MakerDAO and we believe the working with the individuals working on MakerDAO will be mutually beneficial for MakerDAO, the Core Units, and Chaos Labs individually and mutually. We are open to working with the community to determine the right structure to continue / expand our engagement and prove ourselves as is necessary. We will be research and drafting multiple MIPs concurrently for community review to hopefully triangulate on the most appropriate structure, budget, and scope for the current market environment.  Chaos Labs Value CL-001 Mission: As MakerDAO enters a new era of technological and economic complexity, the mission of Chaos Labs Core Unit is to provide a future-proof blockchain testing platform (and services) that enable MakerDAO to continue building products with best-in-class, easily verifiable security. We have a firm bias towards more investments in security, especially when the market is slow and thus the perceived risk are lower.    Chaos Labs - Community Update & Call - July 08 at 14:30 UTC   But the DAO has not needed it in the past, so I cannot in good conscience support bringing it on while also suggesting other units be removed.   The maturation of the market and the protocol, in particular, has driven the need to be more acute. I distinctly remember Black Thursday and the market watching MakerDAO with bated breath hoping, that it would survive. Just because the need wasn\u2019t apparent in the past, does not mean that it will not become one in the near future. If we\u2019ve learned anything from this past cycle, it\u2019s that protocols and the DeFi ecosystem are rapidly growing in terms of complexity and innovation. We\u2019ve watched multi-billion projects meltdown over the past few months: new technologies require new and improved testing paradigms and platforms. Many of these flawed protocol designs could have easily been detected and proved via simulations. The importance of testing, security, and risk management is often evident when it\u2019s too late. Chaos Labs would contribute state of the art tooling to allow Maker to continue moving fast with stable infrastructure.  image2000\u00d71114 130 KB  Oracle and Incentive manipulation is a top of mind concern, but with the market crashing and DeFi protocols so intertwined, the concept of cross-protocol contagion and liquidation cascades is a much more serious threat than it has been in the past. These are some of the direct potential threats, but the value in a Maker-specific enhanced, connected testing environment that will minimize potential vulnerabilities and disruptions is nearly immeasurable in value and worthwhile of continued investment, regardless of market. We have engaged in early conversations with the relevant Core Units that have been listed above, as well as some others not considered about how we can expand on their current mandate without being duplicative or overlapping, but directly beneficial to their specified mandate / KPIs. We\u2019ll hope to share aggregated and specific thoughts in the near future, but would welcome those teams to offer their thoughts individually, as well. The one thing that has become clear, as it was earlier in the SES program: building robust simulation engines is a complicated task and one that would require budget to be done right.    Chaos Labs - Community Update & Call - July 08 at 14:30 UTC   My comment on the work is I believe there\u2019s quite a lot of overlap with the Risk CU which also conducts analysis and research to examine different parameters and sensitivity. Even assuming the budget is not an issue, I believe the current Risk CU can and do handle such already   As @Doo_StableLab specified the Risk team as a key point of overlap, we can dig in a bit there. We do not intend to replace or duplicate the work of the Risk team regarding specific recommendations on parameters or analysis, but give them an additional tool to more accurately estimate the implications of different decisions/proposals on the protocol with a wider-ranging lens. What an engagement with Chaos Labs would aim to do is allow for them to focus more on determine the correct model inputs/outputs and less on building the foundational software that is running between them. By separating the two concepts, we can allow for more sophisticated modeling with more thoughtful analysis such as:  complicated price drop scenarios cross-protocol contagion and impact on liquidations multi-agent modeling on how CDPs will react prior to liquidation specific \u201crandom\u201d simulations and attack vectors such as [Urgent] Adjustments to tip & PSM-USDC-A DC   A similar pitch would be made for other technical teams such as Sidestream\u2019s Clip Auction functionality testing. Circling back to the concept of \u201cCommon Infrastructure\u201d, one of the top things that has been discussed lately is a unified testing infrastructure for new asset addition. This is a testing environment and process consideration that would require inputs and analysis from a number of Core Units (Oracles, Smart Contracts, Sidestream, Risk, Protocol Engineering, etc.). While none of these units individually should be responsible for the burden of creating and maintaining this tool, the cost of usage would be shared across all of them. If a common testing and simulation infrastructure, built as a tailor-made solution for Maker, will enable more assets to be added, quicker Spell creation, and better risk parameter setting,  then it stands to reason that MakerDAO would be able to generate significant additional income from these streams, thus an avenue for Chaos Labs to pay for itself beyond risk mitigation and potential cost optimizations. \u2014 We wanted to start this conversation early to get this exact feedback, iterate on it, and start showing the impact we can have for the Core Units and Community prior to a vote becoming a priority. As we\u2019ve stated, we plan to do a deeper product demo and deep dive next month, but have opened our doors to a variety of Core Units to do proof of concepts as a starting point for collaboration. We aim to act like a Core Unit while in the process of becoming one and separate the conversations around the budget / structure from the value this engagement will bring to the protocol at large. Appreciate your consideration and the thoughtful responses thus far. We look forward to continuing the conversation. ",

Not to mention SES writing in depth challenging current budget adjustments sentiment and also idea for vendor? I mean that\u2019s fine but I think it\u2019s fair to say SES is at least defending incubated CU.   That\u2019s the main reason why I said the topic should be split. These are meant as general comments and not specific to this core unit. It\u2019s up to voters what to do with them. To continue this off-topic conversation, and this is personal opinion: It\u2019s definitely true that I disagree with both the notions of \u201coutsourcing all the things\u201d and the insistence to run a break-even business all the time when practically all income evaporates during dry spells. This combination is a very good recipe to turn MakerDAO into an organization that no one cares about, because everyone\u2019s a hired gun, except as short-term cash cow for MKR holders until it\u2019s starved to death. It\u2019s also the reason why I believe we shouldn\u2019t vote in core units without MKR bonus. The bonuses shouldn\u2019t be too large, but there must be a bonus. Because it\u2019s the most direct tool we have for incentive alignment. (MetaDAOs can potentially change this with their own tokens.) DAOs run to a large degree on passion and a feeling of shared ownership. Telling people they\u2019re officially not part of the project does not create passion or loyalty. So I hope MakerDAO has more ambition than being a short-term cash cow and has the courage to dream big. Instead of focusing all its efforts on letting go over 50% of its workforce, it should urgently look for mechanisms to align MKR holders\u2019 interests with the long-term success of the project. ",

IMO, the slowdown in the DAOs profitability should be question in another forum post\u2014we should be asking what innovative initiatives can deliver and replace the lost revenue, as oppose to attempting to slow down the development of MakerDAO via much needed tooling.

I believe it\u2019s a balance between efficient and effective operation and responsible budgets, where we have to think about allocation of scarce resources. And we have seen it\u2019s much more difficult to cut budgets than to increase as once it\u2019s passed, cutting it have many consequences. Therefore, increasing budgets or onboarding new CUs should be viewed very carefully. The last thing we want is we are forced to cut core functions as the treasury runs low. So with that in mind, even if I support the following statement:    Chaos Labs - Community Update & Call - July 08 at 14:30 UTC   Education is the passport to the future folks. And I believe having teams like Chaos Labs performing diligent agent-based simulations is a step in the right direction. While I understand @Doo_Nam concerns over budgeting, we must remember that the \u201creal world\u201d needs to be educated on the difference between MakerDAO and some of those other Platforms Doo is bringing up here.   Let\u2019s divide this into several parts. In terms of education itself, we have several such as Maker Academy, Brand team, and etc that are working on it and Chaos Labs itself is not focusing on education so I am not sure whether it will be a good reason to support it if the focus is on education. In terms of diligent agent-based simulations, if we believe this is the key point, there are other services such as Gauntlet that can bid as well. And the Maker protocol doesn\u2019t even have ownership or ways to ensure CL focuses on Maker despite paying for all of their various expenses. ",
