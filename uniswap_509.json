Appreciate the great work everyone is doing \u2013 including regarding the proposal to continue the liquidity mining rewards in some capacity. Put together this piece with counterarguments for why there\u2019s no need for the rewards right now, and hopefully opening up some new ideas about how rewards could be distributed in the future + what the treasury could be spent on.

You equally suggested issuing grants/bounty towards building/developing competitive DeFi-based products/applicationns for more advanced Uniswap interaction. Your ideas are intelligent and lofty, but I beg to differ from your opinion that valuation tied to LPM is a \u201cvanity-metric\u201d. I believe for this period LPM still has a subtle role to play as a kind of \u201cstratum-layer\u201d\u2026aside any measure of its correlation to market-share/volume\u2026at least until Uniswap v3 is up and running. LPM reward however can come at a reduced rate and may or may not be in UNI.  Your idea can still be implemented alongside LPM program or whenever possible. One thing is sure LPM program can\u2019t continue endlessly, it\u2019s only for a limited period. ",
