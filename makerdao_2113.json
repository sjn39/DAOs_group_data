Detail The MakerDAO veNFT multisig consisting of @MakerMan, @juanbug, @ultraschuppi and @rspa started administering the VELO airdrop to MakerDAO on 2022-09-26. We received the veNFT on 2022-10-28. Taking wishes from Strategic Finance into account, we talked with Velodrome developers first, who advised us to bribe the USDC/DAI pool to promote DAI liquidity on Velodrome, one of the top DeFi protocols on Optimism. They would also match 35% of our bribes with OP, making our strategy cost neutral. @MakerMan was the initial mastermind of our strategy and found the perfect timing to deploy bribes, so we collected the maximum OP match and had the biggest effect possible. Since then, we deployed 105 transactions as a multi-sig, exchanged one address (flipsidecrypto.eth to an address directly controlled by @rspa), and managed not to lose money while making a visible bump in the DAI in the sAMM-USDC/DAI pool. See this Flipside query for the current pool TVL:  Chart1436\u00d7742 38.9 KB   Chart1436\u00d7742 15 KB  And here\u2019s a chart of our assets:  Total gas cost so far was a little over 0.01 ETH. Optimism is not expensive.  Actions Now @MakerMan has decided to leave us. While we mourn this loss, we want to use the opportunity to streamline our operations even further. We\u2019re looking to expand the multisig to a three-of-five and are looking for two motivated, reliable multi-sig signers.  Self-nominations are very welcome. Please provide your name and one sentence of why we should pick you. We will select two candidates and submit the change to an on-chain poll. ",
