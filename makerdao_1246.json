                    "content": " Updated Growth Task Force Vote This is an announcement that the vote on the Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) had to be taken down and replaced due to an error made by GovAlpha. Please note the change and reach out if you have any questions.  Executive Summary  The Growth Task Force proposal was originally posted as a standard ratification poll due to GovAlpha misreading the requirements of MIP75. The poll should have been Ranked Choice IRV format, as dictated by MIP75. MIP75 is up for approval right now as well, marking the first time a MIP75 subproposal was voted on. Given the lack of initial participation and plenty of time until the conclusion of the poll, the new vote will still end at the regular time (Monday, June 27th @ 16:00 UTC.) While the \u201cOutcome\u201d section of the subproposal vote is mismatched from the Subproposal Parameters, the intention of the MIP was clearly to provide an option for voters to approve a Task Force without their initial budget request. GovAlpha will be refunding the gas used to vote on the earlier version of this proposal.   Additional Details GovAlpha takes full responsibility for this error. The new MIP75 that defines the Growth Task Force Subproposal should have been reviewed in association with the upcoming ratification poll. Because our process was separated (different people reviewing MIP75 and crafting the subproposal poll), the poll appeared ready for production when submitted. We will be refining our process for MIP reviews going forward. With a growing amount of related subproposals and different rules per type of proposal, it is likely that some errors will occur. However, our system must be robust enough to discover these errors, ideally before they reach the voting portal. Updates on our process will follow this month, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions on how the community would like to see GovAlpha respond to errors like this in the future. ",
