The idea has already been ask by community member @SebVentures https://bit.ly/2Gye96v and it seems as if most of us want to avoid talking about it, or we believe Regulators just don\u2019t understand us. If there is a \u201cRisk\u201d to ALL community members, including non-Americans\u2014should we start a working group examining the possibilities of compliance initiatives? We have to believe and think that eventually there will be a day that Regulators will come after anybody who is not in compliance. And you have to believe/think that if you are an ANON it does not mean that you cannot be found by these powerful U.S. agencies. But I don\u2019t need to tell you that.

KYC/AML are national sets of legislations with differing applications for businesses and private persons. Compliance is national and according to entity. One example being US individuals who are not accredited investors not being allowed to participate in ICOs, but it is ok for investment funds. For any non-US individual this does however not apply. For an individual European investor defi is no problem. For a company however it is likely chanceless as you need to KYC your customers  ",
