August 14th is Testnet deploy, so I didn\u2019t want to conflict too closely to that. Essentially part of this would be to have clients & testnet folks coordinate. Here\u2019s also what I think the topics would be:  work on testnet / main net Istanbul deploys \u2013 so more let\u2019s get prepped for testing, interop, and so on kick off for April 2020 \u2013 pick a name, get dates from @shemnon Cheesy Hardfork Schedule, and essentially solidify what the next HF is host working group sessions \u2013 now that we have a list of WGs https://en.ethereum.wiki/eth1 we can ask those people to organize and just help host them  Also: to state again \u2013 I\u2019m floating this as a proposed option. Should CoreDevs meet ~3-4 times per year, with the assumption that DevCon has meetings as well? ",
