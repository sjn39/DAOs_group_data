Then, does the user have to separately purchase MKR as a fee? I wonder if they are still using that method. In addition, I have a question on the makerburn site.  image908\u00d7540 32.4 KB  It was liquidated and I don\u2019t know how to interpret this. Is the borrower\u2019s vault total assets 8.94 ETH, of which 7.11 ETH was liquidated? Or is the vault\u2019s total assets unknown and 8.94 ETH was auctioned off, of which only 7.11 ETH was sold? I like Maker, but it\u2019s too difficult. Any help would be appreciated. ",
