Your collateral was not redeemed.\u201d message. also have a \u201c7480e19: don\u2019t display duplicate cdps\u201d message to the lower right. I don\u2019t have a large degree of technical know how with details to assess what the problem is here. I redeemed another CDP to a different address that I took out around the same time as this one, and had no problems. Could anyone help me figure out what the issue is and how to properly redeem this? UPDATE: Got it sorted. Turns out browser contract data was off on my Ledger. Worked ok once turned on. ",
