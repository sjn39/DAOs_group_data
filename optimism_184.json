Put forward the following suggestions, welcome to supplement the shortcomings, and hope that the administrators will consider adopting them! Based on the settings of Unlocked Supply, the follow-up 14% airdrop should be divided into four stages, that is, once every 6 months, 3.5% each time, which is very reasonable. It is conducive to continuous incentive contribution value, and promotes the prosperity of OP ecology and popularity. .  image1920\u00d7914 47.1 KB  It is hoped that the rules of subsequent airdrops will be more complete and detailed. For example, the maximum reward is set to 100 points, and different contributions will get different score ratios. If you reach 50 points or more, there will be bonus accumulation. The higher the score, the greater the accumulation.  Optimism Users +5 points  Gitcoin Donors (on L1) +5 points  Multisig Signers +10 points  Repeat Optimism Users +10 points  Airdrop 1 users who have not sold Airdrop 1 claim tokens +10 points  Delegate OP voting rights to yourself, and continue to participate in voting +10 points  Users Priced Out of Ethereum +10 points  More than three interactions in the Optimism ecosystem +10 points  The interaction of participating in the Optimism ecosystem includes at least three sections such as: DEFI, NFT, LENDING, BRIDGE, DAO +10 points  Bonus points for the activity on the address chain, such as total transactions greater than 50 +5 points, more than 100 +10 points Other factors that have not been fully considered are welcome. This way of subdividing the airdrop rules can reward users who have made varying degrees of contributions to the OP as much as possible, and can also dilute the witch attack, allowing the team to save the energy of preventing witch attacks and focus on doing things instead.

I think, once token is users address its their call what they choose to do with it. For some it might be tax reason, may be someone sold to buy back later at lower price or someone has bills to pay.  Delegate OP voting rights to yourself, and continue to participate in voting  This is a really good point and we are also thinking about it but major challenge is definition of \u201cparticipation\u201d.
