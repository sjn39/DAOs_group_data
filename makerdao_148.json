But is there a way to require an affirmative acceptance of a Terms of Service or End User License Agreement on-chain for a wallet the first time it interacts with the protocol? If so, do we want to pioneer this kind of permissioned permissionlessness? A way to self-whitelist. I see lots of applications such as self-attestation of being an accredited investor to waiver of liability to agreements to use arbitration, etc. I will admit I don\u2019t know how useful it is legally in major jurisdictions, and will defer to the various lawyers in the DAO on the usefulness of such a contraption.

Putting aside the important \u201cpermissionless vs. permissioned\u201d debate which thanks to 1inch, Aave Arc etc. seems to be relevant again, there might be some value in such a solution in terms of liability protection. There are also challenges (incomplete list, just what immediately comes to mind):   Who would act as a service provider? Typically you have a person who provides a service and requires acceptance of its terms. For example, for services provided on oasis.app, a major external front-end to Maker Protocol, that will be the entity indicated in their ToS. In the case of the Protocol itself, it seems to me that the narrative that a user interacts with a set of autonomous smart contracts with no operator / service provider is usually very useful.   I am not sure if it would be possible to actually display the contents of any ToS / disclaimer, how the acceptance process would look like, whether it is technically feasible (and legally meaningful) to have the acceptance required for bots / direct Protocol access / other DeFi protocols which plug into Maker, etc.   ",
