What I am proposing to discuss here goes kind of against the \u201ctraditional MakerDAO culture\u201d of avoiding memes/pumps/shills/etc, but let me try anyway (mostly for the sake of discussion)  PROPOSAL: Start a SourceCred initiative on Twitter: reward (registered) users based on their number of likes/retweets on tweets containing the hashtags MKR/makerdao/DAI. What do you think? We might just start and try it out for a 2-3 months and see what are the results, and if we like them  @s_ben would SourceCred be able to support the Twitter platform? ",

Moonboi-army not welcome. we grow based on fundamentals, not based on memes   Totally agree on preserving the culture here, in the forum and in the chat. But one of the fundamentals of MakerDAO is for the MKR token to be:  widely distributed (to avoid centralisation in decisions) and, valuable (to sustain bad events in case of unbacked DAIs).  So I would like to challenge this apparent dichcotomy: Nice people/chat/forum  \u2190 vs \u2192  MKR well known and bought by crypto armies. Are the two really incompatible? ",

Yeah perhaps I should have made the: Disclaimer: I don\u2019t even have a twitter account.  But I think it\u2019s full of people out there who like communicating/learning from tweets, and I even witnessed some good tweets (see several examples here: SebVentures twitter account).     Aaron_Bartsch:  I don\u2019t think other large projects have to pay for grass roots marketing. That should come intrinsically from a passionate community of MKR token holders that have an incentive to bring added value to their investment. Ideally this should be free.   Again, I am not an expert of social media dynamics, but I suspect your belief is possibly a bit naive. I am certain that several projects directly pay top influencers to shill their crypto products/coins: youtube and twitter . And if they don\u2019t pay directly, they \u2018stimulate\u2019 grass roots marketing through other systems: airdropping tokens left and right, crazy farming opportunities, etc. So yeah, I don\u2019t think it is \u2018free\u2019 for anybody, really.

We discuss this internally from time to time actually, and may do it one day. tldr; it could be really powerful, but there are reservations around what behavior it could incentivize, and it\u2019s not currently a priority. Part of this is just dev bandwidth. You\u2019d need to create a Twitter plugin for SourceCred, which would involve knowledge of the algorithm and devs to build and maintain it. Also, SourceCred is currently focused on building a new plugin called the Creditor, which could serve similar needs. It allows you to input arbitrary contributions into the graph. This would allow someone to, for instance, submit a list of high-impact Tweets they\u2019d made as a contribution. If the contribution is accepted, Cred would flow to those Tweets and its author. As for incentives, if the payouts are high enough, you will likely be spammed/gamed. Point in case, 1Hive was running SourceCred on its Discord, including its #memes channel (link). Which is kind of a meme-focused social media feed. When their token ($HNY) mooned, the fixed amount of HNY they were distributing per week via SourceCred went from being worth ~$2k to ~$60k. People were making thousands just making memes. Pretty quickly, their meme channel exploded. Lots of brilliant memes at first. Then more spammy, low-effort memes\u2026Eventually, people started gaming it with upvoting rings, which ruined the experience for many honest actors, and 1Hive had to set the #memes channel to mint 0 Cred. Gaming stopped almost immediately. Another \u201ccautionary tale\u201d is the r/CryptoCurrency and r/ethtrader subreddits, which are distributing tokens based on karma (also a reputation system). Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love these experiments, and I think they\u2019re generally going well. But both subs also appear to have a \u201cmeme problem\u201d. Many (if not most) in these communities think memes are over rewarded, but appear to have a problem reining them in. See r/ethtrader\u2019s most recent governance poll related to memes and Twitter posts     reddit    r/ethtrader - [Governance Poll] Change donut distribution for posts of memes... 73 votes and 99 comments so far on Reddit      So, if Maker wanted to go this route, it will likely need additional technical and governance bandwidth, both of which are scarce due to other priorities. On a personal note, I have enjoyed memes and comedy surfaced recently by @Uncle. Even though it\u2019s a bit edgy at times, the community seems to have generally embraced it, and it\u2019s the first contributor I\u2019m aware of in a community using SourceCred that is making money just from art. This seems like an interesting experiment for the forum . ",
