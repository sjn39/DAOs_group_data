                    "content": "The team at Abridged recently engaged with the MakerDAO Comm-Dev on creating a system to ease the pains of Maker governance and coordination.  DAO Ops defined: DAO Ops is a set of practices that aims to systematize the management of DAO functions and reduce human coordination costs associated with resource allocation, decision-making processes, and membership administration.  Decentralized governance is hard. Communities continue to find solutions to make governance system reliable and agile. Issues most commonly seen include 1. asymmetrical information, and 2. inability to access functionality. These become particularly pronounced as organizations form with individuals collaborating across all timezones. Finding agreements among a diverse group of stakeholders around the world requires a ubiquitous knowledge base and shared context. MKR holders need to understand the most critical risks associated with the success of the protocol, the levers available to mitigate these risks, and the decision-making system enforcing necessary changes to these levers. With a track record of bringing tools that increase participation, our team at Abridged is beginning a process to create a product to assist with the new MIP process. The next two weeks we will spend time better understanding the Maker ecosystem, and created this survey to kick off the process. Please follow the link below, or feel free to answer the following questions in comments! Take the Survey Here!  Do you feel that you have a strong understanding of the Maker DAO governance process? (Y/N) Please describe the Maker governance process today. (short answer) Please provide the links you rely on most for participating in and understanding Maker governance. (short answer) Have you ever missed a vote you would have liked to participate in? (Y/N) What is your preferred communication channel? (multiple choice) How important is a mobile notification system? (scale) How important is mobile voting access? (scale) Under which social platform does the Maker ecosystem coordinate today? (multiple choice)  Thanks for your participation. Feel free to reach out OKDuncan on rocketchat to learn more. ",
