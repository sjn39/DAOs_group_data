No public information yet to indicate platform usage. Optimism alignment We are building the 4 dimensional railway of the metaverse - the infrastructure to connect social dapps and enable massive on chain gaming. The cost is too high and the speed too low on mainnet for casual users. Optimism allows for low cost of entry and high user rates, which is absolutely necessary for scale and interconnectedness. Our tools give the metaverse components a place and time, which gives us the ability to create a connection graph to unites the various worlds in novel ways. Map your 3D island, connect like minded groups, or connect anything represented on-chain and help form the neurons of our digital consciousness. These are the portals that will connect our experiences. Optimistic railway is like an on-chain mass transit system, making possible the connection to any world from any world. Move as an individual or as a group. Take a solo or group tour of digital art galleries, join a virtual scavenger hunt, compete in a massive trivia game, or a massive squid game with your NFTs. Mass transit enables unification between collective spaces and encourages coordinated activities for truly unique group experiences. We can build these railways on many chains, and ultimately will, but we would first like to focus on optimism as it has a proven record of success and is directly integrated with Ethereum. How will the OP tokens be distributed? Core team & operations will receive 90%, and 10% will be used to incentivize users through \u201cFree play\u201d entries in our initial games designed to be connected through our system. The core team & operations distribution will primarily be allocated for the following purposes: team compensation (building out core product, public UI, and community support), general project expenses (web services, deployment costs, etc.), and marketing costs (advertising, social media management, cultivating strategic partnerships). How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? The tools built on here are designed to utilize continual micro-transactions, which are ideal on Optimism. Additionally, we will distribute tokens minted on Optimism as in-game rewards in our flagship product, an interconnected on-chain arcade. We are bringing coin operated games to the metaverse, using small amounts of ETH or other tokens to purchase credits, similar to popping a quarter in the arcade machine. This model allows ongoing liquidity by encouraging the flow of in-world tokens to users and accumulating micro transactions that may ultimately be used as liquidity for newer tokens that will live on Optimism. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Once users are in the system, they will continually be incentivized to re-circulate in world currencies to keep the economies alive, but even without that, the pay-to-play micro-transactions will sustain liquidity as long as development around these arcade style games and experiences continues. If the speed of transactions remains fast, the cost of gas remains low, and the gameplay / community experiences remain fun, the community will have little reason to leave. We intend to grow alongside the entire ecosystem and the initial incentives are just opening the door. As we build more fun experiences and allow all creators to connect to our meta-railway, the user growth can and will continue organically. Additionally we can issue new tokens with added benefits to longtime community members to incentivize future activity during potentially slower growth phases. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? This distribution will take place over 1 year total. It will be distributed from the core team portion monthly for 12 months, and from the community incentive pool as soon as the product is ready for beta testing. How much will your project match in co-incentives? We will match 2:1 in in-world tokens or freeplay vouchers. For every OP token received from this distribution, we will give away 2 of a similar rarity token or 2x the amount of in game credits of relative value, e.g. if 1 billion OP tokens exist and we received 1 million, we would mint a utility token of ours in a similar quantity of 1 billion, and give 2 million tokens directly to the community as incentives to use this system on Optimism. A commitment to success. We are committed to building a functional community tool and we hold ourselves accountable to the deliverables. As such, we would like to lock up 50% of the tokens allocated to this proposal for a minimum of 6 months. In order to obtain this half of the funding, we should prove that we have met a predetermined set of goals, outlined below. Only after completion of these goals or 6 months, whichever is later, we will submit another proposal outlining our accomplishment and requesting the remaining 50% of allocated tokens. Depending on the preference of the foundation, either of 2 options can be implemented: a. During this lockup phase these tokens can be controlled via a multi-sig wallet, such as a gnosis safe, with our project wallet as a signer in addition to one or more representatives of the Optimism foundation. From this safe, these tokens can be invested in a pool on Beethoven (Balancer on Optimism - https://op.beets.fi/) to provide liquidity to the community and have an additional positive impact until the OP tokens are available for collection. b. The tokens can remain in the governance fund, without any temporary LP lockup, and are distributed as normal once the second proposal is approved. All of the following goals must be met in order to unlock second half of funding:  Core contracts published on Optimism  Railway Hubs Hub Registry   Public beta available to developers Upgrade plan to account for future development and smooth transitions as railway is improved Collection of example dapps demonstrating capabilities of railway Community website with active resources and points of contact Sufficient documentation to integrate OR into new projects Community forum or discord server to give active feedback and get questions answered Report published on the state of the Optimistic Railway with plans for continued development  ",

Team is new but I am willing to give them benefit of doubt, we all have to start someday, right?

Would the Optimistic Railway team have to submit another similar Proposal to this same Governance Fund (before it ends in 6 months), or would it be something managed directly between the Optimistic Foundation and the Optimistic Railway teams? If I can get my head around this works in practicality, then I\u2019m looking at introducing it into my own Draft Proposal. I appreciate any advice, from either or both of you, on how you envisage this will be implemented beyond the vote. Thank you for your time and any assistance. Kind regards, Axel ",

You have wallet, you know the seed-phrase/private key which means you are in full control of the address and all the asset on that address. In Multi-sig, more than one entity is owner of address. Lets say, there is a multi-sig address with three owner, you, bob and alice, and you agreed that two party approval is needed to move the funds, in that case, each transaction will need approval from at least 2 parties. You can create one such wallet on gnosis wallet. I mentioned it as pro as this shows more transparency, although i highly doubt the OP team has bandwidth to participate in mult-sig ",

There is effectively no match here if my understanding is correct. Locking the funds for 6 months is a lot more operational overhead than simply you returning here in 6 months to make a new proposal and update us all on your progress. You do mention supplying liquidity on BeethovenX so much love for that  The problem here is it\u2019s very difficult for me to assess whether paying your salaries to make this game(?) is a good use of funds. If you work for 6 months and realize this is not a good idea anymore we\u2019ve wasted OP. You could make the game then no one plays it and you realize it wasn\u2019t such a good idea - again we\u2019ve wasted OP. The much cleaner way to do this in my mind is you find backers willing to support you during development - whether that\u2019s raising through gitcoin, seed round, whatever. Then you return here with a working product ready for Optimism users and we simply sprinkle some OP incentives on what is already working and showing traction. There\u2019s just too high of a risk we spend 400k OP on this proposal and it ultimately leads to no new Optimism users or usage, thus I don\u2019t think I can support it. ",

We will be demonstrating the capabilities of the system through a mario-style world-map of connected experiences, but the free play incentive can be applied to any dapp built on the system. There is some cost to run transactions through the Optimistic Railway, as with anything on the blockchain. We will use tokens to pay these costs as well as allowing hub operators to collect a small fee if desired. Whether using our token or a native token like ETH, \u201cfree play\u201d is essentially the same as paying gas plus these operator fees. Our system is designed to minimize gas for many users doing the same type of transaction, however this will never be a free operation on the blockchain so our proposed incentive will translate into real value, and can be adjusted to match the market value of OP received.

A central aspect of Optimism is the retroactive public goods funding.  Given the spirit of not trying to pick future winners that i\u2019ve read in Vitalik\u2019s and optimism\u2019s writing on the subject, i am concluding that the governance fund also isn\u2019t designed to speculatively fund founding teams in the way that an angel or early round venture would.  Rather, the incentives are intended to stimulate usage and liquidity of protocols that are already operating.   I am making assumptions because despite effort, I have not found much guidance.  This is part of the reason why i added the post below.  What is your take?     What is your Evaluation Criteria for Phase 1 Proposals? \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       Reading the proposals has been very educational and interesting.  I can\u2019t really find any evaluation criteria, so I am curious how you all plan to evaluate proposals.  The OPerating Manual suggests that distributions \u201cproactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities\u201d which is pretty broad.  The standard template questions narrow this down much further by specifically asking proposers to explain how their proposal will \u201cincentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism\u201d.  I would plan \u2026     ",

This is in alignment with the governance fund and we are directly adding the value that you just mentioned, which indeed grows the ecosystem. In response to your topics: Value-add We very much disagree that is a small value add. Our railway will allow dapps of all kinds to talk to one another and transport users in new and useful ways. This will improve the development experience as well as the user experience for countless dApps to come. Connected metaverses has been a promise of web3 that has yet to be realized, and this is a component that can move that forward in a big way. Amount The amount received is contingent upon us actually delivering what we say we will. This is based on early feedback we received and is specifically to address the worry of these funds being misallocated or our team being unable to deliver what we promise. OP distribution We believe the biggest value we can presently deliver is in actually building this infrastructure, since it doesn\u2019t yet exist, which is why 90% of the distribution is allocated to core team and services. However, this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t plan to give back in a big way to our community (see co-incentives below). Co-incentives: These are absolutely applicable. The Optimism foundation recommends matching as follows:  the Optimism Foundation recommends that each project submitting a Governance Fund proposal include a commitment to match OP token incentives with their own project incentives (when the project has the capital and capacity to do so).  We 100% plan on delivering at least 2X the value of what we receive in this grant back to the community, as soon as the project has the capital and capacity to do so, namely after this initial phase of development is complete. One of the primary ways we will contribute this is through by paying user fees (such as gas) to travel through hubs (dApps) along the railway. ",

Additionally, 0x will receive funds (from Phase 0 check here) and will be dedicated to grants, in part for NFT and gaming. This, can represent an opportunity for you? Just giving some feasible ideas, let us know what do you think. At this stage, I do not approve of the proposal. ",

Incentive matched  Cons:  Full dev budget Not live on OP Chain  Suggestion:- A POC would help. As you will be using this budget for dev, I will highly recommend you make a ledger of your spending, ideally on-chain verifiable. If you some input here, I would really appreciate that.     Proposal to stop Phase 0 Projects to submit new proposal in Phase 1 \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute the token while other does not. Here is an excellent summary by @MinimalGravitas .  Phase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token between Phase 0 projects. Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.  For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application.

                    "content": "@linda @Bobbay_StableLab I do appreciate the feedback. It\u2019s been very difficult to convince the community without already having a fully built product. We have been available for weeks posting here and on discord, asking for feedback and answering questions and making adjustments to the proposal, but unfortunately all this new feedback is coming after the proposal is finalized and up for a vote. This granting has seemed very unfriendly towards projects that aren\u2019t already fully built, which really leaves us and any other new projects in a tough spot. It doesn\u2019t make sense to focus 100% of the grants on existing built out products, as this is leaving no room for any innovation or development specific to the Optimism space. We have the skills and ideas to move the space forward, but without some funding for development, we simply cannot devote the time required as we have bills to pay and need to focus on other paid work. We know this is \u201crisky\u201d and have done everything in our power to assure the community we will develop and deliver as promised, and we have committed to forfeit half of our funding if we can\u2019t deliver, which we thought addressed the concerns of asking for \u201ctoo much funding\u201d. Again thanks for all the feedback, it would have been much more helpful before the voting began when we were in the draft phase. I would strongly encourage you to change your votes to Yes and give us a chance. We will prove ourselves, but we do not have the capacity to fully build this product first and come back for funding after the fact. If we cannot obtain funding for this phase, we just don\u2019t have the time or capacity necessary to work on this, as much as our hearts are in it. And we are still completely open to new suggestions on ways of proving ourselves every step of the way. We built out the concept and an early tech demo for free on our own time and would hope the code and demonstration would be a clear indicator we are more than capable. Thanks again, please take a chance on us so we can set the standard for early stage funding, which is an essential component to building out any ecosystem. ",

I must say though that the overhead which comes with tracking the technical progress for a project like this is a bit of a deal breaker for me. I think a better approach to securing OP funding, rather than asking for half now and half locked until some deliverables are made, is to make small applications for just enough OP to build out the project layer by layer. For example the initial proposal could ask for 50K OP tokens to get the project started and build out the foundation. Then you can easily reference how the initial 50K was used and re-apply for another funding round which would likely get approved even easier since there is already evidence of a productive use of funds. Each new funding application would be easier to approve since it would contain an overview of how the previous funds were used, until the project is eventually finished. Incrementally funding an initiative like this seems like a much more viable way of building a project from scratch using OP funds and generating trust among delegates that Optimistic Railway can in fact deliver on their ambitions.

The following 6 months will have similar needs, though slightly different, and will be included with our report on the success and continuation of the project once we meet these initial milestones. For our budget we are paying an average of $2000 USD/week per developer and these expenses will be paid in roughly equivalent amounts of OP tokens. If the value of OP drops, we will not allocate more than 1/12 of the total pool of tokens every month, so it is possible devs may get paid lower than this amount, which is understood, though if this happens, we will attempt to balance those underpayments out if values exceed $0.52 in future months. Assuming we receive the grant, we will have 200,000 OP tokens for the first 6 months. Right off the top we will lock up 10% until we are able to allocate those directly to Railway users, which leaves us with 180,000 OP. In order to hit our targets, we have approximately 26 calendar weeks, and a budget 46.8 paid developer weeks, to be allocated as follows: Core contract development 12 weeks x 1 dev (12 dev weeks) Collection of example dapps (3 - 4 demos) 4 weeks x 3 devs (12 dev weeks) Initial community website 4 weeks x 2 devs (8 dev weeks) Initial developer documentation 2 weeks x 1 dev (2 dev weeks) Upgrade plan and report 2 weeks x 1 dev (2 dev weeks) Community setup & maintenance 2 weeks x 1 dev (2 dev weeks) Report on state of Railway 2 weeks x 2 devs (4 dev weeks) Continuation plan for Railway development 2 week x 2 devs (4 dev weeks) Note: this development work will roughly take place in the order listed above, although various goals will be worked on simultaneously by multiple developers. If the timeframe must be extended for any reason, we will have to stretch the existing budget, as unlocking the next set of funds requires completion of these goals. ",
