                    "content": "I\u2019d like here to bring my objection to EIP-1344 being included in the Istanbul hard-fork. The concerns behind the objections have already be mentioned on the EIP-1344 discussion thread but since this EIP is being finalized and discussion on each EIP are meant to be about technical soundness, the best place to raise my concerns seemed to be here in this discussion thread. My concerns are as follow :   EIP-1344 opcode can be easily misused as can be shown in the discussion thread and explained partially in the rationale of EIP-1344. Simply doing an equality check is indeed not enough since after a contentious hard fork (that change the chainID), messages signed before hand (with an older chainID) will fail to be valid, breaking signer\u2019s expectation. EIP-1344 rationale propose thus a contract based caching solution to remedy the problem.   EIP-1344 requires thus a contract based solution to be used properly in most use-case. This is due to the design of the solution EIP-1344 proposes (namely only letting access the tip of the chainID history). This increase complexity and gas cost for no benefit.   In case of minority-led hardfork as described here in details, the contract based caching is insufficient as there will be a gap where a message signed with a past chainID will not be protected from replay.   Note that while I agree with the importance to have a replay protection mechanism for off-chain messages included in the next hardfork, it should not be EIP-1344. All the concerns mentioned above are non-existent with EIP-1965 which achieve full replay protection without requiring added complexity from the users. EIP-1965 should be thus chosen for off-chain message replay-protection instead of EIP-1344 in the next hardfork. Why not have both ? Because EIP-1344 has no useful purpose of its own if EIP-1965 was included. As PR 1965 is not merged in yet though, I can\u2019t add it to proposed list yet. If anyone reading here could help on that, that would be great. Thanks ",

                    "content": "I proposed EIP-1344 for Istanbul because I think it\u2019s the most straightforward and flexible proposal for managing chain ID-based domain separation in the application layer. I don\u2019t believe EIP-1965 has to be Accepted to be proposed for Istanbul, so that should not be an issue in proposing it. It does however have several unresolved technical issues concerning how it might be implemented which are being worked through as we speak. There are many potential use cases for chain ID in the application layer, many of which may yet to be discovered. Some of them require consideration of a change to the value of chain ID in a contentious fork scenario, which is easily implemented in application code per the requirements the developer has for those scenarios (if such a feature is required). EIP-1344 does not wish to be prescriptive of how these scenarios are resolved, instead providing the rationale that developers should consider this scenario when implementing it in their application. Being too prescriptive could potentially be burdensome to the application developer in some circumstances. That being said, there are scenarios where having access to a list of prior chain IDs would be helpful, namely the use of \u201ccounterfactual\u201d settlement contracts where transaction history needs to be processed (in scenarios where the results are not simply aggregated in a final message). I will also state for the record that EIP-1959 was proposed alongside EIP-1344, and may be complementary to it. An oracle contract could be developed to satisfy the intention of EIP-1959 or EIP-1965 if EIP-1344 were made available, with only a marginal increase in complexity of the mechanism required for it to work correctly (the block heights might end up a few off of the true height where the contentious split happened). There are many options here, and I believe EIP-1344 to be the simplest and most straightforward since the information is already accessible in the VM execution context due to EIP-155, as well as the fact that we haven\u2019t seen a contentious split with EIP-155 implemented at the present time (and that we have no actual process in place for changing it in light of a contentious fork).  Edit: I added a link to an example implementation of such a trustless chain ID oracle contract leveraging EIP-1344 to the forum for that proposal here:     EIP-1344: Add chain id opcode EIPs       I decided to draft an example of a \u201cTrustless Oracle Contract\u201d for historical chain IDs, which is something that could very easily be implemented, audited, and leveraged as a standard for any potential use case requiring access to historical chain IDs, without the complexity of alternative proposals.

I can understand that could be the case for ERCs or non-Core EIPs. Core EIPs should be serious specifications and there should be an obvious way to reach someone capable of answering specific technical questions about a specification. If there are multiple hops someone has to go through to reach a technical person, then I do not think such a Core EIPs should have a chance to be accepted. If there is no technical person willing to champion it, that signals to me there is no technical need for it. At the specification stage (e.g. Draft mode) there must be a technical champion. When the specification is clear and coordination focuses around implementing the change in second and subsequent clients, there I could see non-technical coordinators to play a big role. ",

Accepted as a Draft? Maybe the EIP-1 requirements need to be updated because that wasn\u2019t on the list when I submitted blake2b nor 2025.  Your role as the champion is to write the EIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea.  As far as I can tell, that is exactly what I am doing. Of course, anything beyond being accepted as a Draft I understand. Why \u201caccepted as draft\u201d is the gatekeeper for this I don\u2019t understand. I will respect it, I just don\u2019t understand it. What is the issue in labeling an EIP as Draft? Being draft doesn\u2019t mean you are going to be accepted. Being draft doesn\u2019t mean the core-devs need to bring it up on calls. After it is accepted by an editor it could never be brought up again. It is the first stage in the rest of the process. My previous understanding was that the requirements to be made a draft is that it was correctly formatted.     Draft \u2013 If agreeable, EIP editor will assign the EIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the EIP) and merge your pull request. The EIP editor will not unreasonably deny an EIP.   Draft \u2013 Reasons for denying draft status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not in keeping with the Ethereum philosophy.  Draft  \u2013 Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the EIP to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status. An EIP in draft status must be implemented to be considered for promotion to the next status (ignore this requirement for core EIPs).  What is the resistance to marking things as Draft? I am not upset, I just want to understand where I am wrong on this. ",

MadeofTin:   Draft \u2013 Reasons for denying draft status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not in keeping with the Ethereum philosophy.   Also from EIP-1:   Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (cpp-ethereum, go-ethereum, parity, ethereumJ, ethereumjs-lib, and others.   The main point of being Draft and having a somewhat comprehensible Specification is to allow actually useful discussions to happen around it. If a Draft doesn\u2019t have any specification, then how will it be discussed? I actually like @timbeiko\u2019s proposal clarifying the EIP-1 text:   It will be your role as the champion to socialize your EIP and build community consensus around it. Before you begin writing a formal EIP, you should vet your idea. Ask the Ethereum community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research.   My understanding based on this is that EIPs without specification should not be drafts, but rather discussions in appropriate forums, such as FEM. ",
