This proposal may fall under the revision of DeFi committees Project Description: Homora is the world\u2019s first multi-chain leveraged yield farming and lending protocol, and is also the first and flagship product from Alpha Venture DAO\u2019s build arm. Homora V1 was first launched on Ethereum in October, 2020. To offer a more disruptive value proposition, Homora V2 was introduced on Ethereum in April, 2021, with enhanced technology and functionalities such as single asset liquidity providing and flexible borrowing of multiple assets for leveraged yield farming. After the Homora V2 launch, the product has reached significant usage and adoption with a record high Total Value Locked (TVL) of 2 billions USD in May, 2021. To enable our users to take leverage on many assets, Homora is partnering and integrating deeply with Iron Bank, a protocol-to-protocol lending platform and liquidity backstop for the DeFi ecosystem as our main source of borrow liquidity. Homora V2 x Ironbank has continuously expanded across other L-1 chains, including Avalanche and Fantom, to bring high yield opportunities to mass users at lower transaction expenses. To continue lowering the barrier of entry for users, Homora V2 x Ironbank scaled to L2s, starting with Optimism and launching Homora V2 on Optimism as the first leveraged yield farming protocol to integrate with Uniswap V3.

At the moment of submitting the proposal, Homora V2 ranks #1 in the leveraged yield farming and lending category and #9 among protocols within Optimism ecosystem while Ironbank ranks #2 in the lending category and #14 among protocols within the ecosystem Public dashboard: Grafana Total Value Locked: Total Value Locked (all chains): ~70M (1B at peak) Total Value Locked on Optimism: ~20M (35M at peak) No. of opened positions: No. of opened positions (all chains): 17,231 positions No. of opened positions on Optimism: 433 positions Unique address: undefined: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama Total unique address (all chains): 4,966 addresses Unique address on Optimism: 211 addresses Ironbank: Total Value Locked: Iron Bank: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Homora V2  Alpaca finance (BSC, FTM): https://www.alpacafinance.org/  Francium (SOL): https://francium.io/  Tulip (SOL): Tulip  Tarot Finance (OP, FTM): https://www.tarot.to/  Reaper Farm (OP, FTM): https://www.reaper.farm/   Ironbank  AAVE (OP, AVAX, FTM, ETH) https://aave.com/  Compound (ETH) https://compound.finance/  The Granary (OP) The Granary  Solend (SOL) https://solend.fi/   Is/will this project be open-sourced?  Ironbank \u2013 Yes Homora V2 \u2013 No  With Homora V2 product nature, we intend to innovate fast and support future integrations while maintaining protocol security. As a result, we decided to make our code close-sourced to strengthen our user\u2019s security Optimism native?: Yes/No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:  Ironbank \u2013 16th August, 2022 Homora V2 --18th August, 2022 10AM UTC  Ecosystem Value Proposition: Optimism is the first L-2 chain that Homora V2 and Ironbank launched since we believe in the growing ecosystem and the vision of decentralized governance. With our growth strategies to integrate and build partnerships with more DeFi projects on Optimism, we believe that our launch will further drive DeFi activities and liquidity locked on chain, supporting Optimism to grow into a leading L2 chain. Moreover, we believe that our launch will benefit the whole ecosystem stakeholders, including   Users on Optimism to get access to high boosted yields on high-quality pools from top DEXes with enhanced protocol security through leveraged yield farming on Homora V2 and lending on Ironbank.   Builders on Optimism, including   DEXes we integrate on top will gain higher TVL and deeper liquidity added to their pools, facilitating higher efficiency and lower slippage on AMM swaps.   Other protocols that integrate on top of Homora V2 and Ironbank can leverage this partnership to expand more use cases of leveraged yield farming, such as yield strategies and vaults.   Additionally, we have strengthened the Optimism ecosystem by co-launching with ecosystem partners, including Iron Bank, Yearn Finance, and Perpetual Protocol and gained impressive traction of ~$20M in TVL, > 30k impressions and >900 engagement. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 684,000 $OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: Yes/No/In Process How much will your project match in co-incentives? Homora V2 x Ironbank is willing to match additional 45,000 IB tokens to be distributed as LM incentives on top of leveraged yield farming and lending pools Beyond this, Homora V2 x Ironbank has already committed up to 15,300 IB (~$50,000) to celebrate our launch on Optimism and bootstrap the liquidity locked on the platforms over 4 weeks. See more details of our previous LM program here. (Edited 2 Nov 2022: The LM period is extended until 20 Nov 2022) Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? As a builder on Optimism, Homora V2 is requesting 684,000 $OP tokens where   Type1: ~56% of granted OP tokens (~384,000 $OP) will be allocated to users as promotional liquidity mining rewards to help bootstrap liquidity at launch in addition to the organic usage. We plan to prioritize listing the pools with OP tokens to ensure that the distributed rewards benefit back to the ecosystem. The tokens will be allocated to supply pools at a fixed rate of a 16,000 OP tokens per week with the distribution rate at start as follow  Supply pools  OP = 11,000 OP per week ETH = 5,000 OP per week  The rationales behind our token allocation is to incentivize OP lending activities, which will lower the number of OP tokens in circulation while advertising borrowing activities against OP, ETH, DAI, USDC that such that higher farming yields will attract more liquidity providers. Higher borrowing demand will lead to higher yields for lenders. Overall, this will help shape a positive feedback loop, leading to more lending and borrowing activities. However, the allocation of the requested tokens may be adjusted based on market conditions.   Type2: ~44% of granted OP tokens (~300,000 $OP) will be allocated as builder\u2019s grant for protocols looking to integrate on top of Homora and Ironbank. For example, building yield strategy vaults on top of Homora\u2019s leveraged yield farming pools that also contributes usage on Ironbank. This will allow Homora to leverage the synergies with integrated protocols and further increase liquidity and leveraged yield farming and lending activities on Optimism. See example of previous integration here   We target 3 protocols to integrate on top of Homora with the builder\u2019s grant given out on the FCFS basis, with more allocation ratio given to the protocols committing to integrate with us before the grant is approved (as they take on more uncertainties of the grant itself). Currently, we have reached out to 4 partners in our contact whether they are interested in building strategies on top of Homora and 2 of them confirms to integrate with us (Sharpe.AI and Blue Swan Labs) For the requirements to receive the grant, the integrated protocols must use the OP received in a way that  Incentivize on-chain activities and contributes to increase in TVL on Optimism Distribute in a span of at least 3 months  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? As a leveraged yield farming protocol, Homora aims to help bring large TVL and liquidity to the underlying DEXes and become the majority contributor of underlying liquidity pools that it integrates with. (e.g.Homora V2 aims to contribute over 70% to Uniswap V3\u2019s liquidity for the pools that are integrated with Homora) Since many of Homora\u2019s users are degens and advanced investors looking for opportunities to boost their yields, distributing OP tokens as promotional liquidity mining rewards will help incentivize protocol usage and bootstrap the liquidity on Optimism after deployment. As a result, higher farming yields will attract more liquidity providers, while higher borrowing demand will lead to higher yields for lenders. In overall, this will help shape a positive feedback loop, leading to more lending and borrowing activities. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The liquidity mining incentives of $OP token will be distributed over 24 weeks (6 months), with 12 active liquidity mining period (2-week each) Key milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve  Launch on Optimism (18 Aug 2022) with 3 leveraged yield farming + 3 lending pool listing Target 1-week after launch (with IB tokens LM rewards on lending pools)  Gain an average of 20% organic traction on leveraged yield farming pools: 5M (exceed, actual TVL = 10M, contribution = 50%) Bootstrap 20% of the target liquidity on lending pools: 7M (exceed)   List ETH-OP pool and OP lending pools (07 Nov 2022) Target 1-month after launch  Gain an average of 50% organic traction on leveraged yield farming pools (meet, actual TVL = 12M, contribution = 50%) Bootstrap 30% of the target liquidity on lending pools (exceed, contribution = 57.5%)   Target 2-month after launch (with OP tokens LM rewards on leveraged yield farming pools)  Gain an average of 70% on leveraged yield farming pools after the LM rewards are distributed Bootstrap 50% of the target liquidity on lending pools  (meet only on ETH/USDC and ETH/DAI pool, contribute = 74%)   Continue new DEXes, asset listing, and explore integratation with other protocols to increase protocol use cases  Integrate with >=3 ecosystem partners on Optimism   Target 4-month after launch  Maintain a TVL share of 2% across Optimism DeFi landscape     Screen Shot 2565-10-05 at 12.00.321920\u00d7790 105 KB  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? After incentives dry up, there are three key factors that can help sustain the liquidity on Homora V2, including organic traction, a strong track record of usage from Uniswap V2\u2019s liquidity pools, and the first-mover advantage from integrating with Uniswap V3. First, by launching without distributing additional liquidity mining rewards on liquidity providing pools, we can organically bring in a total of $20M in TVL at its peak since launching on Optimism, with ~80% liquidity locked on Uniswap v3 ETH-DAI 0.03% pools from Homora. Secondly, with proven track records on other chains that Homora is currently live on, such as Ethereum, ~50% of Homora\u2019s TVL on Ethereum comes from Uniswap V2 even after incentives dry up. This proves that integrating leveraged yield farming protocol on top of a large DEX like Uniswap can bring sticky organic usage without extra incentives. We aim to replicate a similar impact to Homora on Optimism after integrating with Uniswap V3. Finally, Homora is the first leveraged yield farming protocol to integrate with Uniswap V3, which gives it a first-mover advantage to offer a more unique value proposition towards the Optimism community.

Here is the summary of the feedback and how we act In response to them accordingly. 1. Add the specification on which committee type Homora proposal will fall under: Homora is the DeFi\u2019s first leveraged yield farming and lending protocol 2. Reduce the number of requested OP tokens: We benchmarked our protocol organic traction (TVL) to similar protocols and their granted OP tokens from previous voting cycles and decided to lower the number of requested tokens by 20% to reflect our best interest to grow along other protocols on Optimism 3. Adjust allocation of OP tokens: We pushed back the allocation % for contingency usage to only 3% and decided to add that to allocation for builder\u2019s grants instead. The reason is that we agree with the feedback to focus more on allocating the requested tokens to acquire new integration partners in order to leverage synergies between protocols rather than using the granted tokens on operation costs. Also, we refined this section to be more aligned with the previous distribution reflection from the last cycle retrospective. ",

Here is the summary of the delegate feedback and how we act in response to them accordingly. 1. Reduce the number of total requested OP tokens from 1M to 800k: We received feedback from the delegates regarding the too many OP tokens being requested in one round. Therefore, we decided to break down the requested amount into different requests to reflect different milestones acheived. As a result, we lowered the requested tokens in this 6th voting cycle by another 20% (to 800k OP) to kickstart the first phase of using requested tokens to drive usage on the Optimism ecosystem to show our fairness and sincere intention to grow alongside the Optimism community. 2. Adjust allocation of OP tokens: We cut off the allocation % for contingency usage and distributed the allocation to 80% (640k OP) to be used as Liquidity Mining Incentives on the pools with OP tokens instead to ensure that the OP requested tokens used will be circulating and benefiting back to OP community, delegators, and holders. Another remaining 20% (160k OP) will be used to support new integrations on top of Homora, emphasizing the usage growth even more. 3. Update all the statistics and relevant metrics (ie. Public Grafana dashboard, no. of positions, etc \u2026) to be up to date on a daily basis and include the link to public dashboard ie. DeFillama and DeBank for more transparency 4. Extend the distribution period from 8 weeks to 10 weeks to encourage a more sustainable usage and tractions from requested tokens Thank you @OPUser @ScaleWeb3 @katie @Netrim @MinimalGravitas for your support and useful feedback.

How much you expect now ? I would suggest to reduce the weekly distribution significantly. It seems liquidity on protocol is sticky which is a plus point but you are burning token too fast for my taste. Not being open source is also a point to consider here, I am more aligned towards OSS. This is my personal view and not of committee, committee is reviewing your proposal and once you have approval from 2 delegate and included in snapshot, we will share our recommendation. @Gonna.eth ",

Liquidity is sticky, new innovative approach, focused on V3, good tvl in short time after your launch along with liqduity on main net. I dont like that the protocol is not OSS and high weekly distribution. I assume, we cant do anything about OSS but token distribution still need improvement and I am talking about 5-7K/weekly.  Adjust accordingly and focus on 6 month distribution period or even shorter, you can always submit another proposal in future once current incentives are over. Homora has potential to grow OP ecosystem but not being OSS is against my personal opinion so I will most likely abstain from voting but only if token distribution is adjusted. Most important, remember that I am really small delegate so making change according to my suggestion does not necessary mean bigger delegate will share the same thought. Check with them too and decide.  From committee stand point, if you feel that your proposal need to be reviewed by DeFi committee A please let me know and I will talk to them. ",

Imo 640K Op for liquidity incentives (short-Term APY boost) without co-incentives is still pretty hard to vote for.\u201d Potential improvements (in the best case a combination of the following):  (Lower Overall Ask, put higher focus on project onboarding than LM) Co-incentives: Match at least the liquidity mining rewards Adjust distribution & or incentive design for more sustainable, sticky incentives Target existing user groups, pools, projects to move over to (your pools on) Optimism  We believe Alpha Homora can significantly contribute to initial liquidity flow to important Optimism pools ($30M already, good initial pool choice ) with this proposal. As Homora is mainly attractive to \u201csmart money\u201d though, we are afraid these LM incentives will be picked up by professionals and excess users & liquidity will leave as soon as Op incentives run out. Thinking out loud\u2026end-user onboarding is tough at the moment but we believe it\u2019s a great time to onboard stablecoins, large projects to Optimism DEXs and consequently to levered pools on Homora. Looking forward to your ideas around co-incentives matching and OSS concerns! ",

Thus, the previous Homora V2 on Optimism proposal will now become a co-proposal between Homora V2 and Ironbank. 2. Protocol information update As a result of (1), key information (contact person, website link) and all relevant metrics relating to the Ironbank protocol will now be included in the proposal. 3. No. of tokens request and allocation We adjusted the number of tokens requested to the amount that we believe could attract more TVL and activities on Optimism given the contribution of both Homora V2 and Ironbank. We also add the allocation to bootstrap OP lending pools as an additional to only the borrowing side to help lower the amount of OP in circulation. 4. No. distribution period We extend the distribution period from previous 16 weeks to a total of 50 weeks (roughly 1 year) to show lower the requested tokens burn rate and show our intention to support sustainable growth on Optimism.

                    "content": "This update shows significant changes in the proposal:  Ironbank as co-proposer has already meaningfully contributed to (TVL) growth on Optimism incl. the liquidity mining campaign financed with IB tokens Overall distribution of tokens will still be 80% towards liquidity and 20% for builders. Of the 80%, 15% go to OP lenders on IB which \u201cmight\u201d cause less selling pressure than the 85% (680K Op) for liquidity mining of popular Uni V3 pairs. IB offers co-incentives of 111K IB (current price 3$). Price of IB is trending down though and the marketcap is only $500K USD - hence the effective co-incentives might be much lower. Distribution of LM rewards over 50 weeks instead of 16 weeks. Ask increased again from 800K to 1M Op in total.  To summarize our thinking:  Alpha + IB demonstrated already value-add and potential to move significant TVL to Optimism. 6 months distribution of LM rewards would make more sense. (Follow-up proposal possible) 20% (200K Op) Builder incentives can spur additional, sustainable growth. It\u2019s great to have another place to take out a loan against Op on Optimism. (15% of 80% = 120K Op) 85% of 80% = 680K Op for liquidity mining incentives is still a huge ask. 111K IB as co-incentives on top of  leveraged yield farms & lending pools show good will but there is a ? how much that will actually contribute.   \u2192 Maybe reduce Ask by 50%+, stick to distribution over 6 months & create a new proposal when this co-growth program ends, success was demonstrated - incorporating lessons learnt. Overall, this co-proposal looks stronger than the proposal before. Thank you for bringing in Ironbank. We appreciate the hustle for co-incentives though we are not confident they will be significant due to illiquidity and low floating supply. Echoing @jackanorak\u2019s comment, we don\u2019t see a good reason for changing the distribution schedule towards 1 year and raising the Ask to 1M - still lacking significant co-incentives. @prima You mention TVL contribution (see below): Liquidity is very important for protocols to enable traders and other protocols to build on. That said, we should look more at effective liquidity, marginal value added to the Op ecosystem and sustainable incentives, which also means that tokens should not be temporary APY boosters which are instantly sold & less Op incentives are left for the rest of the ecosystem. Some earlier proposals (xToken, Gamma, Uni Staker; all grants) might have gotten a larger amount but it\u2019s important for Optimism to spend Op more wisely going forward to not waste resources, grow the overall ecosystem & not add risk without reward.     prima:  To clarify, we benchmark our protocol TVL contribution with other protocols applying for the grant, so we considered the ask a reasonable amount given that we are applying as a joint proposal between Homora V2 x Ironbank.

                    "content": "Recommendation from DeFi committee C Details Detailed proposal focused on liquidity mining and protocol integration. Homora (Prima) was active throughout the cycle, indulging community by answering their query and adjusting their proposal on the basis of suggestion and feedback. Value-Add Protocol was deployed in August and has attracted 23MTVL according to Defillama. Comparing Uniswap V3 TVL for the last month shows it has been steadily in the 49 to 55 M range. Nevertheless the protocol has attracted TVL which seems to have migrated from UniV3 but with no obvious increase on either side. Initial pool selection shows a good understanding of UniV3 volume drivers, already accounting for half of USDC/wETH (0.05%) total TVL on UniV3. They outline in their proposal that new pool/assets will be added and looking at their past performance they tend to go for the best return pools. Traction Not native to Optimism but the integration with UniV3 is new and unique. Activity on other chains has shown a consistent pattern of integration and resilience in the face of a downturn market movement. Their track record for Liquidity Mining shows a TVL expansion to accompany them. Amount Divided into 2 groups: Increased numbers on 6/OCT to 1M but also increased the time frame for distribution to 50 weeks a) Type 1 / Liquidity Mining to incentivize borrowing (800K OP). Weekly 20K Distribution. Lending pools (15% of Type1)  OP (15%) = 3,000 OP tokens distributed among OP lenders  Liquidity providing pools (85% of Type1)  Uniswap v3 WETH-OP 0.3% (45%) = 9,000 OP tokens distributed equally among OP and WETH borrowers Uniswap v3 WETH-USDC 0.05% (20%) = 4,000 OP tokens distributed among USDC borrowers Uniswap v3 WETH-DAI 0.3% (20%) = 4,000 OP tokens distributed among DAI borrowers.  b) Type 2 / Builder grant for protocols on top of Homora (200K OP) Amount is a flat 200K to be distributed at the Alpha\u2019s discretion with no specific milestones nor KPIs, the idea of building blocks on top of Homora or Iron Bank. Both seem appealing for Value added and Traction. As Homora is not a DAO, team will decide who to give this incentive which could be gamed easily. Their track record does not suggest such a path as probable. No Governance provision is included in the proposal. Additional information would help. OP Distribution Heavily increased from the revised 16 weeks to 50 weeks. Track record shows this kind of programs if applied to borrowers can have a short/medium term impact. Sustainability should not be an issue considering Homora has already attracted a sizable chunk of TVL without incentives, same as Iron Bank. Suggestion is to focus on short duration. Co-incentives Co-Incentives are going to be run by Iron Bank using IB Tokens, around 111K IB tokens, ~340k USD at the moment of review. They represent around 40% of total ask which seems low when compared to other co incentives approved in the past. Alignment Alpha seems to be very aligned with the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole and Homora implementation is a building block on top of Dexes (Curve, Balancer, Sushi, UniV2, UniV3, PancakeSwap, Trader Joe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, Beethoveen X, SpiritSwap) AND on Iron Bank, Chainlink, Band Protocol. General comment regarding Open Source, Homora has stated they will not open source on the short term, as a measure of security with its users. Recommendation No Liquidity Mining was reduced 2 times from their original ask but then increased back to 1M. As was the distribution period to 50 weeks. Furthermore the ask should be reduced at least to 500k, with a heavy emphasis on building composability on top and less on LM.Time-frame for distribution should be 4 to 6 months. Then can re apply if needed. Note :- This committee acknowledge that the proposal was significantly changed after receiving the two-delegate endorsement. Which could mean that the original endorsement should not be considered binding. But this is an edge case as such scenario has not happened in the past and we can not make a rule change mid-cycle. In case this proposal is included on Snapshot for voting, our recommendation should be consider as official committee decision. cc @prima Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread.

Here is a quick recap on what we have been through as there are lots of both iterations on feedback for improvement and significant changes to the proposal after submission  Submited the proposal for governance fund cycle #6 by creating a thread and submitting in gov-temp-check in discord  Received the feedback, majorly on 1) Too much number of token requests and allocation period 2) No existence of co-incentives matching 3) Homora V2 being non-open-sourced   Actively reached out for >=2 delegates\u2019 approval for cycle #6 but managed to get the approvals (from @katie and @mastermojo) during cycle #7  Revised the proposal structure to apply as a joint-proposal with our partner; Ironbank, a protocol-to-protocol lending platform which provide liquidity for Homora users to enable leverage  Added Ironbank information Included co-incentives matching in $IB tokens Increased number of tokens request to 1M, extended the period to 1-year   [Current] Re-submitted the proposal for cycle #8 as there are substantial changes in proposal structure  Actively reach out to integration partners and set up a solid process on what are the requirements and how our builder\u2019s grant will be allocated    Below is the list of some feedback we received so far on cycle #8 and how we incorporated that into our latest proposal in order to move the proposal forward from [DRAFT] to [REVIEW] phase as per the operating manual.  From @jackanorak  on no. of tokens requested and distribution period, suggesting that a longer term of allocation should not be the solution for too much number of request.   \u201cI don\u2019t believe that anyone here has suggested a longer term and yet you\u2019ve gone from 8 to 10 to 16 to now 50 weeks in response to feedback that the weekly ask is too large.\u201d  We are looking to shorten the distribution period to 6 months  From @OPUser on pool listing suggestions and LM rewards, suggesting that the different OP pools should be considered for LM rewards   \u201cOne suggestion would you consider replacing WETH-OP 0.3% to a different $OP pair. Gamma has a join proposal of 900K OP dedicated for this pair, so what do you think about using different pair ?\u201d  We have thought about it but as now we are collaborating with Gamma protocol on integrating new pools (with auto-compound and rebalance features) on Homora V2 (Tentative pools are OP-ETH 0.3%, USDC-DAI 0.01%, DAI-ETH 0.3%, USDC-ETH 0.05%) which will be available around end of November, the full resources are allocated there to support this partnership. Therefore, we might revisit new OP pools again once we completed integration with Gamma.  From @ScaleWeb3 on no. of tokens requested and distribution period, how the granted tokens are used, sustainability of apply rewards, suggesting lower no. of tokens requested and distribution period (to 6 months) and allocating more % as builder incentives, as well as looking into integrating with active manager protocol.   \u201c6 months distribution of LM rewards would make more sense. (Follow-up proposal possible).\u201d   \u201c20% (200K Op) Builder incentives can spur additional, sustainable growth.\u201d   \u201cLiquidity is very important for protocols to enable traders and other protocols to build on. That said, we should look more at effective liquidity, marginal value added to the Op ecosystem and sustainable incentives, which also means that tokens should not be temporary APY boosters which are instantly sold & less Op incentives are left for the rest of the ecosystem.\u201d  We are allocating more % to the builder\u2019s grant, lower the distribution period, and explored integration with Univ3 active liquidity manager protocols.  From @Netrim  on open-sourced concerns and potential workarounds to push the proposal forward   \u201cNot being open source subtracts support but it will not be a hard NO. Also you hinted there was a way to having a workaround for open sourced code.\u201d   \u201cFor instance moving things from LM to the builder grant amounts was very well recieved\u201d  We are cutting off LM rewards allocation to the borrowers and focusing on builder\u2019s grant instead.  From  DeFi committee C cycle #7 recommendation, majorly suggesting on more allocation % to builders with provision of more transparency on builder\u2019s grant (ie. how it will be distributed and key milestones)  We have included details of what are the key criteria of getting the builder\u2019s grant, how the grant will be allocated, and add integration milestones. To sum up, we responded to the above feedback by proposing these changes   Total no. of token requests \u2013 The overall ask is reduced from 800k to 684k by cutting off entire LM allocation (Type1) to borrowers and allocating some to builders (Type2) instead.  Distribution period \u2013 Shorten to 6 months from previously 12 months  Add milestones and details on builders\u2019 grant \u2013 The builder\u2019s grant will be allocated to the integrations partner on FCFS basis with more allocation ratio given to the protocols committing to integrate with us before the grant is approved. We target at total of 3 integration partners within 6 months with 2 protocols now committed to integrate with Homora V2 on Optimism.   ",

                    "content": "Recommendation from DeFi committee C Details Detailed proposal focused on liquidity mining and protocol integration. Homora (Prima) was active throughout the cycle, indulging community by answering their query and adjusting their proposal on the basis of suggestion and feedback. Value-Add Homora attracts significant liquidity (17MTVL according to Defillama) and can improve liquidity on key pairs for Optimism. They outline clearly in their proposal which pool/assets will be added and how liquidity will improve. The builder incentives are rather large but focused with a direct impact on Optimism. Traction Not native to Optimism but the integration with UniV3 is new and unique. Initial pool selection shows a good understanding of UniV3 volume drivers, already accounting for half of USDC/wETH (0.05%) total TVL on UniV3. Activity on other chains has shown a consistent pattern of integration and resilience in the face of a downturn market movement. Comparing Uniswap V3 TVL for the last months shows it has been steadily in the 49 to 55 M range. Their track record for Liquidity Mining shows a TVL expansion to accompany them. Amount Incorporated feedback and reduced the amount to 684K OP - which is reasonable for the size of Alpha & impact of this proposal. a) Type 1 (56%): Liquidity Mining to incentivize borrowing (384k OP)  OP = 11,000 OP/week ETH = 5,000 OP/week  b) Type 2 (44%): Builder grant for protocols on top of Homora (300K OP) Intention to forward 3 large grants to 3 affiliated projects (Sharpe AI, Blue Swap Labs, x) which build yield strategies on top. They will use Op to incentivize growth which seems beneficial to Optimism & Homora. OP Distribution Good time-frame and reasonable weekly distribution  Liquidity incentives: 16K Op per week for 6 months Builder grant will also be distributed over min 3 months  Co-incentives Iron Bank will offer 45K IB Tokens ~154k USD at the moment of review. They represent around 40% of total liquidity ask which is rather low compared to others. Alignment Alpha seems to be very aligned with the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole and Homora implementation is a building block on top of many DEXs AND Iron Bank for additional yield strategy protocols. General comment regarding Open Source, Homora has stated they will not open source on the short term, as a measure of security with its users. KPIs Clearly defined  Liquidity gains & TVL share Support of key assets/pairs Ecosystem integrations  Recommendation :- Yes This proposal is focused on increasing liquidity along with protocol integration. Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread ",

The proposal references incentivizing Iron Bank lending and Homora leveraged yield farms but isn\u2019t clear how much will go to either. The current description suggests it will be used to reward the folding of ETH and OP on Iron Bank, which in our opinion doesn\u2019t bring any sustainable value to Optimism.   The builders allocation doesn\u2019t make much sense if Homora is closed source and building on Iron Bank is not a tremendous achievement since IB is a generic Compound v2 fork.   ",

Alpha has asked Iron Bank (their exclusive partner) to add co-incentivizes to the OP received.

                    "content": "Hi, thank you everyone for the additional comments. While we understand the community\u2019s concerns, we would like to use this opportunity to share our perspective and answer all the concerns raised as thoroughly as possible.  Why Closed-Sourced?  First of all, we understand that protocol being open-sourced is highly valued in the Optimism ecosystem, however, we would also like to mention that being closed-sourced doesn\u2019t equate to increased security risks as well. This decision made on our end is to provide another buffer layer for security to make our protocol safer. To provide more context, we\u2019ve had an exploit happen before on V1 when we first launched on Ethereum. Since then, we have been trying to make extra cautions to prevent any potential hacks from happening again. As a result of this incident, we believe having our protocol closed-sourced would be the best way to ensure the highest security (for now). To further strengthen the security, we performed several audits when we relaunched V2 on Ethereum with Peckshield, Quantstamp, and Openzeppelin. As for the audits on other chains, despite those chains are EVM-compatible and not much of the code is changed, we still sent the code for audit. Our audit report for Optimism is hare: Optimism - Homora V2 Our team has been building in the DeFi space since 2020, deploying first on Ethereum and being the first to come up with the concept of leveraged liquidity providing. Our goal to innovate has never changed and we have been consistently bringing yield opportunities across different key chains to users, and Optimism is the first L-2 chains our protocol went live on. This can be evidently seen with our organic TVL peaking at 35M when we launched on Optimism within the first month and being the first leveraged liquidity providing protocol to integrate on top of Uniswap V3. To clarify, our code is not fully closed sourced; we are willing open source to those who become key partners of Homora or necessary to have access to the full code. This has already been the case with Iron Bank. The code is given more on a necessary-basis to make sure that the code will not be exposed to other potential security risks. By keeping it closed-sourced, we believe this can greatly reduce any malicious acts from potential hackers or external parties. We believe most of users who are interested in interaction with our code would only fall 3 main categories: 1) Key Partners 2) Integration Partners 3) Malicious Actors For key partners, such as Iron Bank, they currently have access to our private repo, which gives them access to our full code as it is required to ensure Homora functions normally. For integration partners, we give them necessary public resources to integrate with us.  [How to integrate with Homora V2] How to integrate with Homora V2 - Homora V2  [Whitelisting criteria] Homora V2 Leveraged Yield Farming Integration Requirements - Google Docs  [Integration doc + public code for integration] Alpha Venture DAO \u00b7 GitHub   For malicious actors, by keeping it closed-sourced it greatly reduces any opportunities for them to tamper with the code or come up with potential hack. With all that being said, we also understand the importance of protocols being open-sourced. Thus, we make sure that we are as transparent as possible from other angles. Our team is fully doxxed with Tascha as our Project Lead and Nipun as Tech Lead. Our whole team is fully committed to bringing value to the Web3 ecosystem and you can see Tascha actively engaging with people in the Blockchain industry through various conferences and talks. If there is a need for any additional clarification or further information, we are happy and willing to hop on a call.  Clarification on how the $OP Grant will be used  A) Type1 request for LM (56%) and how it will be used   All 56% will go to lenders on Homora (already mentioned in the proposal but here\u2019s a recap):   Type1: ~56% of granted OP tokens (~384,000 $OP) will be allocated to users as promotional liquidity mining rewards to help bootstrap liquidity at launch in addition to the organic usage. The tokens will be allocated to Supply Pools at a fixed rate of a 16,000 OP tokens per week with the distribution rate at start as follow:  OP = 11,000 OP per week ETH = 5,000 OP per week    The rationale behind using 56% to incentivize only on the lending side for OP + ETH:  To us, lending also represents a way to stake asset and keep the supply circulating in the ecosystem. Moreover, by incentivising more supply on the lending side, it can help keep Homora V2\u2019s utilization rate at an optimum rate as it will ensure borrowers can still open leveraged position at a reasonable interest rate. As borrow interest lowers, farming with leverage will also yield higher APY, incentivizing more borrowing to perform leveraged yield farming activities (positive loop). This also benefits and make it easier for other builders to build leveraged strategies on Homora V2.    The rationale behind NOT incentivizing the borrowing side:  We received feedback and concerns when we allocated a portion on the Homora\u2019s borrowing side. Thus, we decided to incentivize borrowing activities via Type2 \u2013 Builder\u2019s grant instead which will encourages more vaults and strategies to be built from other integration partners. This will enable users to earn yields more easily with just one-click deposit through vaults. We believe this will be a way to use OP grant more sustainably while making DeFi more accessible to new/inexperienced users and onboard them to Optimism ecosystem as well.    B) Type2 request for Builder Grant (44%) and how it will be used  Purpose of the Builder Grant:  This is dedicated to bring partners who are not currently building on OP to enter the ecosystem, potentially helping to bring more liquidity inflow and activities to Optimism from users on other chains as well as more yield opportunities and DeFi use cases available. Many protocols we are currently looking at are active liquidity management protocols that can diversify user strategies and lower risk levels while offering high returns. As mentioned in the Type1 request, the dedicated will help keep the borrowing costs at the appropriate level, making it easier for builders to build on top of Homora at the same time.  Process of Evaluating Builder:  Although we mentioned in the proposal that it will be on an FCFS basis, we still carefully evaluate each team with due diligence to make sure they are a team with a trustworthy background and their product will bring value to the Optimism ecosystem. As for Sharpe.Ai, it is a project incubated under Alpha Ventureo DAO in our other arm. However, they have also undergo the same screening process and demonstrated the potential to provide value to Optimism. If they are one of the 3 protocols to finish integration first, then they will be eligible to receive the grant as well.  How We Ensure Builders Bring Value To Optimism  For builders to receive the grant from us, they must agree with the requirements provided by us, which will mainly be to incentivize on-chain activities, contribute to increasing TVL on Optimism. Builders must also use the grant correctly (i.e not use the grant for audit cost or operational cost) and distribute in a span of at least 3 months to avoid $OP supply from burning too quickly. Current Milestone/Expectation With Confirmed Builders (Which we already mentioned above but will recap again):  Blue Swan Labs \u2014 They are building PDN vaults on Homora\u2019s leveraged Uniswap V3 ETH/DAI and ETH/USDC pools to start with, aiming to launch the beginning of next year. Sharpe.AI \u2014 To start with, they are building strategies vaults on Homora\u2019s Uniswap V3 stables and volatile pools. They aim to finish development and testing by the end of November. Aperture Finance (tentative) \u2014 We are already in discussion and the team is currently exploring the feasibility of building with Homora V2 on Optimism and have just proved their PDN strategy at ETH SF Hackathon.  *Note: They are currently only building strategies on the available listed pools on Homora V2. As we plan to list more pools (that match our listing criteria) in the future, there is the possibility of these builders expanding strategies to other pools on Homora as well.  How We Can Ensure Full Transparency of Builder Grant Usage:  In the past, we\u2019ve always opened a separate wallet for grant rewards. For Optimism, we plan to do the same when distributing the OP grant. We will agree with all builder grant recipients to use a multisig wallet and ensure that all the OP grant usage will be traceable on-chain.  Integrated with only top DEXes ie. Uniswap V3  Although Homora is currently only integrated with Uniswap V3, this does not mean we are not open to adding pools from other DEXes. When we list new pools, we have several hard criteria that need to ensure the pool can be leveraged while ensuring high security. To give more context, we have already explored and reached out to other DEXes on Optimism, including Velodrome and Beethoven X:  For Velodrome, the pools that pass our security criteria (can refer to full doc above) are currently unable to be leveraged, thus unable to benefit users. For Beethoven X, many of the assets within the pools are Beethoven X-native without oracle price feed (yet), thus we are unable to list them for security reasons.  As long as a pool matches our listing criteria and offers opportunities to be leverage, we are open to working with other DEXes from the ecosystem. cc: @millie @polynya @ScaleWeb3 @jackanorak @linda @lefterisjp @OPUser @GFXlabs ",

NOT a fan of Iron Bank, they were an uninspiring spin off from a CREAM <> Yearn collaboration back in early 2021   Iron Bank seems to be the main beneficiary of this proposal   A \u201cfolded ETH/OP\u201d automated strategy is not really worth all those incentives as it brings little value from a liquidity stand point   In good faith I CANNOT endorse incentivizing deposits into contracts that are not verified on etherscan (Open source licence is not required, only public contracts)   The builders allocation goes to projects which should be applying for their own grant   If Alpha Homora had public contracts, I could support an open ended builders allocation for any project that does build on Homora (if that ends up being the projects mentioned in the proposal that\u2019s fine)   I find your approach to security by \u201cobscurity\u201d to be quite negligent given that the exploit from 2021 was specifically from an Iron Bank <> Alpha integration that used non-public contracts!!!
