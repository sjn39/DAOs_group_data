                    "content": " Background  Over the years, Gitcoin\u2019s mission has grown and evolved to showcase the positive role web3 can play in solving the global coordination problems (please read this link in particular) we are all facing. In contrast to the pervasive doomerism that\u2019s emerged in light of our declining institutions, we believe that we can still build a solarpunk future where creating positive externalities is not just the exception but the rule. As we continue to build this future, Ethereum can become a schelling point for the hopeful. Historically, we\u2019ve been doing this in an inside-out fashion, building the machine that builds the machine of web3 first by helping new intrinsically motivated contributors get paid to build an open web, then by helping maintainers get the funding they direly needed via quadratic funding experiments like Gitcoin Grants. But as the DAO and the ecosystem at large has evolved, the community has begun to think bigger about the role we can play in seeding new experiments; everything we are building involves playing infinite, multiplayer games. Naturally, this has led many folks to think about how Gitcoin as an Impact DAO can form a true DAO of DAOs consisting of some of the most values-aligned projects in the space.  Practically speaking, this overlapping DAO of DAOs is something Gitcoin has previously missed an opportunity to improve its own positioning through as well, by being unable to help grantees like Uniswap level up past smaller grants to larger forms of funding (often dilutive funding via VCs). Had we been able to do mutual grants then, some of these projects may have been able to avoid VC funding and instead form values aligned networks. In turn, we could imagine a more intentional relationship leading to a much larger amount of future public goods funding than what Uniswap currently provides (although we are grateful for what they do already).  The Journey So Far  To this end PGF has been pursuing small scale mutual grant agreements as opportunities emerge. Mutual grants as the name suggests are reciprocal grants of tokens for shared governance, with partners that are committed to working with Gitcoin via aqueducts, side rounds, or, more broadly, shared public goods related missions. While these have largely been successful, there lacks a formal process or committee behind each one. As PGF seeks to scale the size of these agreements, it\u2019s become clear that the DAO needs a better framework for evaluating a project\u2019s relevance to our mission. To fulfill this need, a few contributors have been starting first with a framework for how we might prioritize things like side rounds or mutual grants, based in part on a conversation here. In short, currently PGF measures: 1) Ecosystem Impact (e.g. Legitimacy): How much impact is a project likely to have in solving a key coordination problem in web3 and beyond, and will governance in their organization allow us to work to build something greater than the sum of its parts? 2) Strategic Relevance (e.g. GMV): How likely is the project to support the democratic, pluralistic vision we have for public goods funding and thus, as an example, increase GMV of grants 2.0 instances? If a project does not increase these measures directly, are there ways working together could increase them indirectly? 3) Execution Risks (e.g. Size of Deal): How likely is it that we\u2019ve missed something / that we\u2019re wrong about the future ability of a project to deliver? If we are wrong, how much does that impact us in the long run? Here are some brief high level examples of how these considerations play out: Example 1: Partnerships with groups like Wonder are likely higher risk than those made with a group like Uniswap who have a longer track record of impact in the ecosystem, and thus as stewards discussed should be for smaller amounts if any. At the same time, these projects are often willing to give more to public goods (as in the case of Wonder\u2019s 1% aqueduct commitment). Example 2: Although partnership with Radicle or Giveth would clearly be values aligned, pushing this forward would require much higher energy in terms of time for meta-governance and in terms of the amount we would have to request as a grant from those groups to properly engage in mutual governance. These are lower risk but also higher cost to execute.  Achieving a Pluralistic Vision at Scale  Where do we all go from here? First, although the framework above is necessary it may not be sufficient, and PGF contributors want to work more closely to outline the \u201cbar\u201d for mutual grants moving forward. The general belief is that this bar has been met, but order of execution has been on a first in first out basis and could likely improve. Second, prioritization is not a transparent and open process. Although PGF believes this process cannot be fully transparent for reasons noted here, they also believe now is the time for us to put together a committee that can review our prioritized recommendations in advance and have an active discussion with the workstream on a more frequent basis. With that in mind, members of PGF would like to invite members of the stewards council to join a working group on mutual grants. Joining this group is not necessarily an easy task but it\u2019s a necessary one, and would likely take between 5-10 hours a week for at least three stewards if stewards were to agree that it is relevant to Gitcoin\u2019s objectives. Committee membership would involve:  deciding when project alignment is high enough to necessitate a mutual grant (what bar should be set) helping to prioritize different proposals from external partners (in what order do we conduct grants and how often) work to suggest strong partners that come up process evaluating these proposals post-grant, helping to execute on meta-governance between different groups by serving as a member of at least one mutual grant multisig used for inter-DAO voting  Members of this group will be paid a stipend by PGF for their help on top of any amounts from other activities. If you\u2019d like to get involved, council members will have time to ask questions during the next call, so please reach out to a council member to make sure yours get in. Alternatively, feel free to reach out to one of the PGF workstream leads (@annika @Fishbiscuit @vgk and myself) so that we can discuss in more depth! ",

                    "content": "Hey @ceresstation do you think that workstreams that resemble more of sub-daos or side-daos fall within the \u2018mutual grants committee\u2019 framework or scope of work? Here\u2019s why I\u2019m asking the question. The examples im thinking of primarily in asking the question here are  KERNEL moonshot collective FDD dCompass MMM  At various times, each of these workstreams has flirted with going independent (or multi-DAO) and starting to seek governance tokens from multiple DAOs. Current course & speed, there is no standard for what those deals look like.  But a few recent examples:  KERNEL was incubated at Gitcoin Holdings, and is becoming its own independently governed project.  Vivek and I directly negotiated the terms of that departure such that he could be successful and that Gitcoin could make sure expectations were well defined of how Gitcoin was involved in the KERNEL project from now on. FDD (consuming 93.5k GTC/season) continues to flirt with spinning out a SDD (Sybil Dao). dCompass (consuming 38k GTC/season) continues to flirt with creating its own independently governed project. MMM (30k GTC/season)/MSC (130k GTC/quarter) has both had inconsistent discussion about becoming it\u2019s own independently governed project.  One example Ill drill deeper on recently is dCompass.  Specifically, the following has come up in discussion about dCompass:    [Discussion] dCompass - release plan and beyond   If GitcoinDAO continues to allocate GTC (governance rights) to dCompass, will it receive governance rights in an eventual dCompass DAO? What amount? Does this amount differ if dCompass is given more GTC in S14/S15?   To which @huxwell responded:    [Discussion] dCompass - release plan and beyond   Yes Gitcoin DAO should have a say in the governance of the dCompass DAO. Gitcoin is the biggest funder so far and it makes sense if it\u2019s one of the main governing entity of the dCompass DAO. I\u2019m open to negotiate regarding the amount but we can offer 2 seats in our council, which is currently a 3/5 multisig that we can update to be 5/8 so by owning 2 seats, Gitcoin DAO would have 25% of the governance rights. If Gitcoin DAO continues to fund us (through GTC or any other token), we\u2019re open to make a mutual grant agreement to make a swap between GTC and the DCOMP token for a maximum of 5% of our total supply.   I guess another way of asking the question at the top (does this fit in the MGC scope) is:  Who should be the counter-party to negotiations with @Huxwell (dCompass) or @DisruptionJoe (SDD) or @Fred (MMM) or @emudoteth (MSC) in the creation of this workstream flavor of mutual-grants? Is there a standard set of criteria/terms for when GitcoinDAO will/wont support these entities becoming independently governed?  Is there a common understanding of these criteria of terms?  Of course, the default option is to do nothing (not include these types of deals in the MGC scope).  There are a couple of problems with the current approach.  The primary one is there is no mutual understanding that there should be a correlation between the GTC governance rights that GitcoinDAO  gives to these workstreams to get them off the ground + the eventual governance rights of their independently governed project that GitcoinDAO gets back. This incentivizes the workstreams to keep requesting more GTC ad infinitum from GitcoinDAO.  I would venture to say that if a workstream fails to meet its goals  and thereby stays longer to consume more GTC, it should give up more governance rights in its eventual departure (or be shut down if its just not working).  Not having this understood upfront increases the risk of misunderstandings + hurt feelings down the road. Another problem is that GitcoinDAO has put a lot of work into being regulatory/legally compliant.  Without a process for the creation of these independently governed sub-DAOs, there is no way to make sure the sub-DAOs are regulatory legally compliant too.  Open to feedback on the thinking here.

Not having this understood upfront increases the risk of misunderstandings + hurt feelings down the road.   We\u2019ve requested 38k GTC previous season because we thought we were ready to scale and compensate more contributors. However our estimations were not accurate enough, we made this proposal before having a proper product roadmap.    [Discussion] dCompass - release plan and beyond   Mid season 14 - Alpha version: testnet environment, not audited Late Season 15 - Beta release: mainnet and L2 deployment, audited Season 16: DAO and token launch.   Failing is part of the journey but we\u2019re willing to improve and learn from our failures by minimizing the risks for the DAO and staying in alignement with our roadmap. So I\u2019d like to suggest the following approach.  instead of requesting more GTC, we will actually request way less for Season 14 and it would be our last season with recurrent funding from the DAO in both scenarios below.  Optimistic scenario: Assuming that we got back on track after Season 14 and reached our goals, we would work on a mutual grant agreement for a proper spin off. Pessimistic scenario: If dCompass was to fail again for accomplishing the Season 13 goals (going to production and hitting KPIs) then no mutual grant agreement would be created. ",

I\u2019d be happy to help build an effective framework to evaluate a potential mutual grant and make sure we set ourselves up for these grants to go beyond just a token swap into tangible value add and synergies between Gitocin and these projects or helping these bring a lot of value to the rest of the ecosystem! Continuing to nurture the relationships and execute on synergies will strengthen all mutual grant efforts. On a slightly separate note, regarding @owocki\u2019s comment on streams going independent \u2013 an idea that might be interesting to explore is  Orca Pods. Of course, I have far less context on how Gitoin governance works but this immediately came to mind as I was reading the challenge/opportunity of how to think about sub-daos. (Pods are small working groups, usually centred around one expertise. Each pod has its own multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the pod members. So pods can be thought of as mini-DAOs within a larger DAO.)  Although they are not yet active and still developing the product,  it might be a useful mental model to think about and possibly an aligned protocol to build synergies with. ",

At the same time, these projects are often willing to give more to public goods (as in the case of Wonder\u2019s 1% aqueduct commitment). Example 2: Although partnership with Radicle  or Giveth  would clearly be values aligned, pushing this forward would require much higher energy in terms of time for meta-governance and in terms of the amount we would have to request as a grant from those groups to properly engage in mutual governance. These are lower risk but also higher cost to execute.   I like the thinking around risk/rewards or cost/impact; I think those are very simple but powerful primitives. But as you mentioned, some partnerships might need a high amount grants to create reasonable engagement. I would add that it will also require high effort; someone should probably manage this partnership and be actively engaged in their governance, product development, strategy \u2026 and that can be a full-time job.     ceresstation:  Practically speaking, this overlapping DAO of DAOs is something Gitcoin has previously missed an opportunity to improve its own positioning through as well, by being unable to help grantees like Uniswap level up past smaller grants to larger forms of funding (often dilutive funding via VCs). Had we been able to do mutual grants then, some of these projects may have been able to avoid VC funding and instead form values aligned networks.   I would put even more emphasis on this - the problem with VC money as I see it is that it\u2019s just the money without the commitment and support. VC-funded DAOs very often struggle with governance engagement as there are no clear incentives to be involved for the VCs. I believe if we are creating an ecosystem of DAOs, something like business partnerships, there are incentives in place to make sure that we are supporting each other as we depend on each other success.

Mutual grants as the name suggests are reciprocal grants of tokens for shared governance, with partners that are committed to working with Gitcoin via aqueducts, side rounds, or, more broadly, shared public goods related missions.   I had no idea mutual grant agreements were a thing that PGF has dabbled in before. I\u2019d love to see this grow and evolve in the coming seasons and I\u2019m definitely interested in helping out with the committee if it comes back! ",
