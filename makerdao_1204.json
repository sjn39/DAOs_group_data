Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Online PDF Version | Show some love to our Medium account   We have some new ideas for improvement and would appreciate your feedback to help make the Weekly Relay more enjoyable publication.     Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Governance (GovAlpha) Core Unit published a forum post outlining the strategy it has developed to improve MakerDAO\u2019s off-chain incentivization system in response to an ongoing discussion about how to best use SourceCred. The SourceCred tool has proven to be an innovative reputation tool for fostering open collaboration among a decentralized team of contributors. However, SourceCred also has limitations. The main issue is that our SourceCred instance makes it difficult to modify incentives to keep rewards from falling into contributors\u2019 hands who already receive a salary from MakerDAO. GovAlpha has developed an approach to strengthen the MakerDAO governance process by incentivizing \u201cconcrete and result-producing\u201d initiatives based on the Off-Chain Governance Incentive Objectives. Proposal The proposal requests 72,000 DAI to create a new fund pool that will be distributed to all successful governance proposals, including MIP proposals, MIP sub-proposals, and Signal Requests, at a rate of 6,000 DAI per month. Contributors are encouraged to submit proposals in a timely manner since rewards are dynamic and dependent on the number of passing proposals submitted. Rewards Maximum Rewards  MIPs: 2,000 DAI Sub-proposals: 1,000 DAI Signal Requests: 500 DAI  The reward pool for each month is distributed according to the following weights:  MIPs: 1 Sub-proposals: 1/2 Signal Requests: \u00bc  Further Details Management The pool will be managed by GovAlpha using the Concrete Actions Reward Tracker. GovAlpha will post a short rewards report each month. Budgetary Impact 27% of the budget already designated for SourceCred would be used to finance this proposal, meaning there would be no additional budget expenditures. Opting In Members of the community with an official forum account are eligible for off-chain proposal bounty payouts. Contributors must provide an Ethereum address that can be seen publicly. Successful contributors will receive DAI at the beginning of each month. Proposal Bounties (Maker Operational Manual) This month, six bugs were submitted through the bug bounty program. All of them were found invalid by Immunefi Services Triaging. Mistakenly Archived Proposal Announcement @prose11 made an announcement on Discord regarding a proposal that was archived by mistake:  1309\u00d7351 60.8 KB      Executive Vote(s) June 01, 2022 did not contain an executive proposal. Due to the lack of proposals or items requiring inclusion in the next Executive Vote, Protocol Engineering and GovAlpha concluded that it was best to skip the scheduled vote on June 01, 2022, and resume the usual Executive Vote schedule the following week on June 08, 2022. For more information, please visit this post.  Governance Polls There is a problem with voting on the recently posted Prioritization Polls. GovAlpha has removed the UI for the polls as they investigate and resolve the issue. An update on the situation will be available soon. Prior to removal of polls: Please, check out the feedback survey mentioned at the head of this publication to help us improve Active Governance Polls. This week bares exciting news on improving Governance: GovAlpha has released the first round of monthly prioritization voting, featuring two sentiment polls!
