This is a great example of how to ensure MakerDAO assets remains public goods for the DAO. The existing users of sub-domains for redirects and emails on makerdao.network are now listed in the Asset Registry and will continue as Content Managers of their assets with grandfathered access. For anyone that want to become Content Manager of a new makerdao.network subdomain please use the MIP60 process. The same goes for email records - However, if this modification of management passes without opposition then Core Units will by default be able to have email addresses using either (cuid).makerdao.network or (cuid).makerdao.com hosted on their own email server.
