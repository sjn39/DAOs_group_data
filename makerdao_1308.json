What We Would Do: List DAI token on the Knights DAO Promote DAI on our launchpad Coins Zap About KXCO.IO - Knightsbridge: KNIGHTSBRIDGE DAO is a decentral organization that spans the entire Metaverse ecosystem. KNIGHTSBRIDGE DAO includes unique modules such as the KXCO \u2013 Knights Exchange, NFT Hub, Wallet and aims to provide simple and reliable access to selected Crypto/NFTs while actively creating new classes of digital assets. KNIGHTSBRIDGE DAO prioritizes high-quality projects by vetting and rating projects. We are working to onboard external Rating Agencies to make this process even more independent and transparent. Knightsbridge has over 200,000 member accounts in over 23 different countries, with a strong Asian footprint. The design is all inclusive, for web, android, IOS, and more, prioritizing accessibility. liquidity and funding: There are no fees to get your coin listed, there are no initial payments to be made backing your coin either. For example, on traditional exchanges to have your coin listed you would need to provide all the money that could match the value the coins tally up to. On Knightsbridge, all you need to do is list the coin, we promote the coin, and roughly 30% of revenue is saved on the exchange to create the liquidity for the coins. So we would basically be creating the value as the coins were bought and sold, there\u2019s no need to do crowdfunding just to start backing the coin before listing. If you are interested in having your token listed with us on our exchange, please get in contact with me via Email, or Telegram. I look forward to hearing back from you.
