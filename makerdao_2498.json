See my comment here for details.  This post is intended to communicate the planned timeline for voting and possible implementation of the Peg Stabilization Module (described here: Peg Stabilization Modules: A Pre-MIP Discussion) I\u2019ve communicated this a number of times informally, but this should be considered the canonical resource. 20th July - On-Chain Governance Poll: \u201cDoes Maker Governance want to implement the Peg Stabilization Module proposal in some form, targeting implementation at the end of July?\u201d If this poll fails to have a majority yes vote, the rest of this timeline will not take place. 27th July - Ranked On-chain Governance Poll(s?) which will determine the parameters with which the PSM is deployed. 31st July* - Authorisation and activation of the PSM included in weekly executive vote. *Note that the inclusion in the 31st July executive will depend on how smoothly the smart contracts domain work goes on the PSM. If the implementation is not ready by the 31st, it will be included in the 7th August Executive vote.  One possible difficulty for this timeline is figuring out what the poll or polls on the 27th of July should look like. I would recommend that governance start considering concrete options as to what certain parameter settings for the PSM should be. I think it would be ideal if we had a set of 3-5 \u2018parameter packages\u2019 or strategies to choose from. This should help to ensure that whatever set of parameters ends up moving forward to the executive is at least consistent within itself. Parameters available For each PSM  Fee In Fee Out Debt Ceiling ERC20  There can be one or more PSMs with the same or different ERC20 tokens operating with different fees and debt ceiling settings.

I believe it\u2019s low, <0.5%, but not zero Using the 50 million USDC ceiling that people have thrown out for the PSM.   Even if the PSM had 0.04% fee both ways, at 10% daily turnover, it would be 50M*.1*.0004*365 = 0.73M or an effective APR of 1.46%. So that\u2019s great, relatively in line with the current USCD-A vaults, so maybe we could have an even lower fee. Which got me thinking\u2026 Could DEX aggregators route orders through PSM? Unless I\u2019m missing something in the ecosystem. There isn\u2019t a DEX that can currently do a 10 Million USDC/DAI swap, regardless of slippage. Could DEXs route orders through the USDC/DAI pair on the PSM to take advantage of the arbitrage? So a USDC -> ETH swap would be a USDC -> (tap PSM) -> DAI -> ETH. And really, if the USDC/DAI spread is high enough, all er20 token swaps could be done through the PSM. If that\u2019s the case, then maybe a super low fee, eg 0.01% (effective 0.365% APR using same math above) would help encourage this use (because it would lead to selling DAI -> restoring PEG) *Edited to fix curve fee ",

I heard some discussion on the last governance call about setting the fees to something like 5% or more. This seems like the wrong approach to me. I hear the concerns of Rune and others regarding 3rd parties not integrating Dai because of the peg. If we really want to get some next level liquidity available, then I think a tight spread on the fees is the way to go. We want to be able to go from 10M USDC to Dai (and vice versa) with minimal slippage to onboard these larger players and build trust in the system. This is currently not available, and I doubt fees of 5% or even 0.5% are reasonable to allow this to happen. In my view it\u2019s trust, trust, trust at this stage, and we need to provide these guarantees that if I\u2019m in Dai, I will be able to get back out into fiat via USDC without massive slippage.

Fee In : 1.5%, then 1%, then 0.5% (stop if the peg is restored) Fee Out : 0% (to reduce USDC custody risk at the minimum) Debt Ceiling : unlimited (more on that below) ERC20 : USDC, then the Paxos stablecoins  Those setting would enable the ability to buy DAI at 1.015 USDC then 1.005. We can discuss if a cap at 1.005 is close enough to 1 for DAI users (I would say close enough). When peg return close to 1 (starting at 1.003 for Uniswap users), the PSM USDC will be drained by arbitrage (less expensive than any alternative). On the unlimited cap, it means the willingness to increase the ceiling each week if needed. It will avoid any significant arbitrage risk if USDC fails. Still, this \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach will send the right message to the public, anyone buying DAI at 1.015 or above will lose 1%. The ceiling will have to be reduced if not used. The main risk is if the community think DAI deserve a premium to USD (or any other USD alternative). Let\u2019s hope collateral onboarding will provide enough supply while keeping counterparty risks low (diversified). In any case, the peg will be hit, the more the USDC PSM is filled, the less valuable DAI is (at the limit USDC risk + MakerDAO risk can\u2019t be more valuable as only USDC risk). If we want to provide liquidity of first resort, we can provide liquidity to trading pairs on Uniswap and balancer. That would be great to bring value to DAI usage. Much more an ecosystem building strategy. I like it. But this isn\u2019t the same problem. ",
