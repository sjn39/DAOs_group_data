                    "content": " TLDR  In the last Gitcoin Community Call of 2022, we had a community discussion around naming our protocols and the products we\u2019re building on top of them (or, the dApps being integrated with them that will be used by program managers, builders/project owners, and donors. Now that we are gearing up to actually launch the protocols, it\u2019s time to give them final names, so we\u2019re looking for feedback on our top contenders.  The presentation from this session can be found here - and has some helpful additional context  Why we\u2019re here:  As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential). We\u2019re looking for feedback from the community on the work being done across workstreams and led by MMM. This post is about naming, and aims to gather feedback on final names being considered for:  The set of dApps running on our protocols, working name Grants Suite, latest name Grants Stack  Our protocol that enables groups to pool and allocate funds to support their collective goals, currently called Grants Protocol  Our protocol that empowers project owners to build a project profile, grow their reputation and apply for funding, currently called Project Protocol    So far, there have been three other posts in this series:  An explanation of key definitions like Brand and Brand Strategy then walks through the foundational work leading up to the synthesis of the Brand Strategy, which can be found here. A post soliciting feedback on Brand Vision, Brand Mission and Brand Values, which can be found here. A post soliciting feedback on our Brand Personality, Voice & Tone, which can be found here.     Specifically, we\u2019d love your feedback on:   Approach: How we\u2019ve approached the naming process and the philosophy behind naming selection  Top Selects: The short list of names in the running for Grants Protocol and Project Protocol  Anything Missing: Names you like that you think we\u2019ve missed And, if you have time, take a look at the current naming brainstorm here  We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we\u2019d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12!   Anything else?  The current naming brainstorm can be found here and is open for input, but we ask that you please leave feedback on the governance forum In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback in the #brand-pod channel in the Discord.   Defining our Approach To Naming What goes into developing a successful product naming strategy? First and foremost, it\u2019s important to understand the target audience for the product. The name should appeal to and make sense for this group. It\u2019s also important to consider the product\u2019s positioning within the market and the overall brand. In addition to considering the target audience, positioning, and overall brand image, it\u2019s also important to consider the brand\u2019s mission, vision, values, and personality when developing a product naming strategy - hence why naming has come as a later stage. In summary, our criteria for deciding on a name looks like this:   Audience Aligned: The name will resonate with the target audience.  Value Prop Aligned: The name should effectively communicate the product\u2019s value proposition.  Positioning Aligned: The name fits the overall product positioning within the market and within the overall brand (e.g., harmonizes/does not conflict with the brand name or other product names)  Vision Aligned: The name should align with the brand\u2019s long-term goals and help to bring the vision to life  Mission Aligned: The name should align with the brand\u2019s mission and purpose  Values Aligned: The name should reflect the brand\u2019s beliefs and principles, and should appeal to people who share those values.  Personality Aligned: The name should fit within the overall tone and aesthetic of the brand, and should effectively communicate the brand\u2019s personality.  We also outlined some secondary creative considerations to gut check ourselves once we landed on top names, which included:   Cohesiveness: Names that feel like a \u201cset.\u201d  Independence: Names that can standalone and feel just as strong as when used together  Pronunciation: Easy across languages  Ownable: Not infringing on names of other products/protocols in our space  And specifically, one more consideration for the protocols:   Openness: Protocol names that give a sense of flexibility, customizability, and possibility  No Use of Protocol: Protocol names that don\u2019t need to have \u201cProtocol\u201d in them or following them (e.g., we call Lens, Lens - not always Lens Protocol)   Types of Names There are several different types of names to consider when naming a product.  1302\u00d7484 96.3 KB    Descriptive names clearly and directly describe the product and its function, such as \u201cSunscreen Lotion\u201d or \u201cQuick-Dry Towel.\u201d These types of names can be useful for new and innovative products, as they help the consumer understand what the product does right away. However, they can be limiting and may not allow for much brand personality. On the other end of the spectrum are invented or abstract names, which are more creative and memorable but may be harder for the consumer to understand. Examples include \u201cNike\u201d and \u201cApple.\u201d These types of names allow for more brand personality and can be effective for established brands, but may not be as effective for new products as they may be harder for the consumer to understand. Another option is to use a combination of both, such as \u201cHair Food\u201d or \u201cLife Water.\u201d These types of names provide a hint at the product\u2019s function while also allowing for some creative branding.  Other Considerations Product vs. Brand Name: Another important consideration when developing a product naming strategy is how the brand and product names fit together. A strong brand name can be a powerful asset, and the product name should complement and support the brand name rather than overshadowing it. For example, if the brand name is more evocative and memorable, the product name may be more functional and descriptive to clearly communicate the product\u2019s value and purpose. On the other hand, if the brand name is more functional and descriptive, the product name may be more creative and memorable to add personality and stand out in the market. It\u2019s also important to consider how the product name will fit within the overall brand name and product portfolio. The product name should fit within the naming system and structure established by the brand, and should not conflict with any other products within the portfolio. It\u2019s also important to consider the product\u2019s potential expansion and how the name will fit within the brand\u2019s overall product portfolio. The name should fit within the brand\u2019s overall messaging and aesthetic, and should not conflict with any other products within the portfolio. This is where brand and product architecture come into play. A strong brand architecture helps to clearly define the relationship between products within a portfolio and how they fit within the overall brand. This can include creating a naming system, such as using a specific word or phrase in all product names, or using a specific naming structure (e.g. all names starting with the letter \u201cS\u201d).  Naming Grants Stack, formerly known as Grants Suite This brings us to our first name: The set of dApps running on our protocols, working name Grants Suite. Grants Stack is the first-ever solution connecting grants program managers, donors, and project owners to launch, participate, and scale community-powered grants programs. It enables a streamlined process from program deployment to application management to funds allocation, encourages donor discovery and support of projects, and empowers builder participation and reputation building. Most recently, we began socializing Grants Stack as the new and updated name. Why? Let\u2019s check against our criteria.   Audience Aligned: The name will resonate with the target audience - CHECK   Value Prop Aligned: The name should effectively communicate the product\u2019s value proposition. - CHECK   Positioning Aligned: The name fits the overall product positioning within the market and within the overall brand (e.g., harmonizes/does not conflict with the brand name or other product names) - CHECK   Vision Aligned: The name should align with the brand\u2019s long-term goals and help to bring the vision to life - CHECK   Mission Aligned: The name should align with the brand\u2019s mission and purpose - CHECK   Values Aligned: The name should reflect the brand\u2019s beliefs and principles, and should appeal to people who share those values. - CHECK   Personality Aligned: The name should fit within the overall tone and aesthetic of the brand, and should effectively communicate the brand\u2019s personality. - CHECK   Pronunciation: Easy - CHECK   Ownable: No one else in our space currently using it; while it\u2019s not trademarkable, it\u2019s highly descriptive, so less important here - CHECK   For the first half of these, here\u2019s what we looked at:   Audience: Our primary target audience for this set of tools is program managers; the tools will also be used by builders/project owners and donors, but the program managers will be a main driver in getting them to use - thus keeping GRANTS in the name is valuable  Value Prop: The value proposition for this set of tools of course varies by audience, but for our core audience, program managers, the value is that this is the first comprehensive solution that enables them to create and scale a program, plus engage/encourage donors and empower project leaders - thus STACK makes sense as a descriptor for these tools  Positioning: Similar to the value proposition, we\u2019re positioning this as the only end to end solution, and this name signals the comprehensiveness of this set of tools; we also want this name to signal intuitiveness, reliability, impact, so keeping the name direct and descriptive helps us achieve this  For more reasoning on the second half, take a look back at past posts about Mission, Vision, Values and Personality and you\u2019ll see how this name fits with those as well. You may be wondering what happened to previous names: Grants Manager, Grants Explorer, and Grants Hub. Grants Stack is comprised of several dApps built on top of our new protocols plus the Passport integration. These names were for those individual dApps. For now, we\u2019ve aligned to not name the individual dApps, but instead speak to their functionality in the context of the Grants Stack (Manager, Explorer and Builder.) We will no longer be referring to the individual dApp names (although it\u2019s likely just out of habit those names will continue to come up - but we\u2019ll be socializing a robust glossary soon that will reinforce the transition away from these.) You might also be wondering why we don\u2019t mention our new protocols - or why they aren\u2019t part of the naming of the Grants Stack. We\u2019ve aligned on not going too far into the underlying tech powering these dApps, as that will be part of the protocol marketing strategy, which is more focused on ecosystem partners and developers at this stage. For this reason, we are thinking about the Grants Stack name separately from the protocol names. More will be shared around this thinking in a very near future governance post about Grants Stack Marketing. Again, we\u2019re encouraging feedback here - would love all thoughts on the Grants Stack name.  Naming Grants Protocol This brings us to our second name: our protocol that enables groups to pool and allocate funds to support their collective goals, currently called Grants Protocol. As a reminder, this protocol is an open, permissionless protocol that enables and scales community-led funding systems by allowing groups to pool resources and build funding mechanisms that are uniquely tailored to their needs. It will allow for more efficient, democratic distribution of funds through a variety of mechanisms in the long term. For now, our primary audience is developers who want to build on the protocol. Grants Protocol powers two main functions of the Grants Stack - the Manager and Explorer functions. We kicked off the naming process with a cross-workstream brainstorming session, which looked like this:  1172\u00d7772 162 KB  We then opened up additional brainstorming prior to our Community Call naming session. Over the holidays, we gave community members the opportunity to add to this brainstorm here, and then cast a vote. The short list of names for Grants Protocol came down to:   Alo Protocol: Evocative; Alo means feed, rear, cherish, educate, sustain in Latin and is also short for \u201callocate\u201d  Allocate Protocol: Descriptive; tied to core functionality of the protocol which is helping to allocate funds to communities building shared needs  Stream Protocol: Evocative; stream suggests a flow of capital but also ties into the more nature-inspired elements of our brands like biomimicry and mycelial networks  Pollen Protocol: Evocative; similar to stream, pollen suggest pollination, essential to germination and growth similar to funding for community projects and also ties to the nature-inspired elements of our brand  Plurality Protocol: A blend between descriptive and evocative; helps describe our pluralistic tool that is the protocol and simultaneously signals our intention to showcase many and ties into our overall mission and vision  To be clear, there were not an overwhelming number of votes. But it\u2019s time to name these protocols, because they are launching. So here, I encourage you to go back to our criteria and evaluate these names against those for yourself. At first glance, most pass the criteria. The key concerns I have are:  Alo being latin vs. just using Allo which comes from the English Allocate being too on the nose Stream sounding like it relates to a streaming/music service Pollen already being used for a DeFi protocol Plurality losing its impact if not paired with Protocol after it Descriptive vs. Evocative naming in general - is one better than the other for encouraging devs to build? There are certainly different opinions  Given that Alo has the most votes, I am encouraging us to consider Alo vs. Allo. I also encourage you to consider this as part the Gitcoin protocol portfolio, which includes Passport and will also include whatever we name Project Protocol. Rather than running down the list of criteria and evaluation here, will let you do that on your own and leave feedback in the comments section.  Naming Project Protocol This brings us to our third name: our protocol that empowers project owners to build a project profile, grow their reputation and apply for funding, currently called Project Protocol As a reminder, this a decentralized registry of projects designed to empower project owners to grow their online reputation, demonstrate impact and connect with funding to bring their vision to life - all with sovereign ownership of their data. It acts as a project\u2019s single home where project owners can integrate their most up-to-date information to easily access resources they need to thrive. Concurrently, the protocol can act as a repository in which funders can source and validate trustworthy, impactful projects that will help grow their ecosystem. For now, our primary audience is developers who want to build on the protocol. Grants Protocol powers a main function of the Grants Stack - the Builder function (previously known as Grants Hub.) Project Protocol was part of the same process.  696\u00d7622 89.1 KB  The short list of names for Project Protocol came down to:   Node [Protocol]: Evocative; In botany, the part of a plant stem from which one or more leaves emerge; in tech, a point at which lines or pathways intersect or branch; a central or connecting point; alludes to the protocol proposition as this being a hub empowering project owners to create a single profile they can then use to establish reputation  Seed [Protocol]: Evocative; in botany, the embryonic stage of the plant life cycle, suggesting a starting point from which everything blooms; alludes to the value proposition of being an essential starting point for project growth  Base [Protocol]: Descriptive: a conceptual structure or entity on which something draws or depends, a foundational structure; ties into the core functionality of the protocol serving as a hub for projects  Interestingly, none of these were originally followed with \u201cProtocol\u201d in the original brainstorm. There were also many other descriptive names that had a couple of votes, like Project Hub Protocol and Project Registry. Again, I encourage you to go back to our criteria and evaluate these names against those for yourself. At first glance, most pass the criteria. The key concern I have is Seed being owned by our friends at Seed Club. Additionally, considering the common association between seed and capital (e.g., seed funding), it feels to me like a better fit for our Grants Protocol. But regardless, I\u2019d worry about us using it. As with Grants Protocol, I\u2019m also still wondering about the Descriptive vs. Evocative question. Here it again becomes important to consider this name alongside our other protocols, and to consider the aforementioned proposed names for Grants Protocol as well as our existing Passport. As before, rather than running down the list of criteria and evaluation here, will let you do that on your own and leave feedback in the comments section.  Next Steps Are the names here? I\u2019m not sure. Personally, I would love to see more options and a robust discussion here. We already have Passport - it\u2019s simultaneously evocative and descriptive. It\u2019s not a literal passport - but the name alludes to what it does, while also describing it as a tool. Does Allo do that? Does Node do that? No. Names that would align with Passport would be things like Wallet or Bank, Hub or Home. If we go with a latin name for one, should they all be Latin? Honestly, it probably doesn\u2019t matter - we don\u2019t need to be rigid. The point of this post is to lay out the considerations and the criteria so you can evaluate and give feedback for us to consider as we evaluate next steps. We will likely not have a vote here on the forum, but again, feedback here will help determine that. We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we\u2019d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12! ALSO! You might be wondering when we\u2019ll be sharing the most up to date information on Grants Stack and the other protocols - this will be shared in forthcoming governance posts in the next week.  Share your feedback! We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we\u2019d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12!  Looking for additional context? Here\u2019s a quick reminder of how we got here and our objectives of this work After months of foundational work that included reviewing past iterations of our mission and vision, speaking with different community members and thought leaders, surveying stakeholder audiences completed, and coming back together to synthesize, we started to distill key pieces of our Brand Strategy (as a reminder, you can learn more about Brand and Brand Strategy in the last governance post in this series, here.) The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions. Our intent is to develop a Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity. In its entirety, the Brand Strategy will define vision, mission, core principles, and strategic approaches for the foreseeable future (until another revision is deemed necessary by the community). The aim is to align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared \u201cNorth Star.\u201d To better understand how we reached the below, and to understand it more comprehensively, visit our Brand Evolution Board as well as the original Brand Attributes Workshop, which kicked off this work. We\u2019ve referenced our community\u2019s past work - including the Other Internet work and the Mission and Vision work ",

I actually think it\u2019s quite descriptive in that the project registry will act as a point from which any project can plug into the resources it needs to thrive. \u201cNode\u201d also has a definition in botany which I think could illicit some cool visuals that are emerging from the visual brand refresh work. As for Alo (or even Allo), I\u2019m less attached to this one. I did propose the name and love the essence of what it represents: Al\u014d refers to the transitive act of causing someone or something to grow or develop - which I think is very fitting for the essence of the protocol but as an integrated name it feels slightly less connected. I do love that it\u2019s shortform for allocation as well and\u2013although maybe not immediately obvious as an \u201cAllocate Protocol\u201d\u2013the name could be a quick reference for users once they are familiar with the protocol. I also like the idea of using \u201cAlo\u201d (not Allo) and potentially playing with visuals of aloe plants. That said, Alo feels more disconnected from \u201cPassport\u201d and I think the visual identity would need to be slightly more technical to bridge that gap. I don\u2019t think this would REALLY matter in the grand scheme of things but I understand your hesitation with this name. I also like the proposed \u201cStream\u201d - I hadn\u2019t thought of it in the context of a streaming but I like what it represents and I also like the potential of incorporating water into visual references.

                    "content": "Thanks so much for putting this together @alexalombardo. I think we have a really strong framework for coming to a decision here given your efforts. I\u2019m also biased but glad to see my suggestion for moving Grants Suite to Grants Stack was well received. On protocol naming, my view is that we probably need to dive deeper into the why for each of them (and it sounds like that\u2019s partly the goal of this thread which is great). In particular, many of the names (e.g. base / node / core) or (seed / roots / garden) define broader categories of thought that set the stage for a broader conversation about a \u2018type\u2019 of name. Is it going to be something that sounds more technical (e.g. node), or something that sounds more natural (e.g. seed)? Knowing this can then better help us pick \u2018sets\u2019 of names that fit together. I know you\u2019ve outlined the importance of \u2018sets\u2019 already, so I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but there are currently many names that don\u2019t map to the same \u2018set\u2019 as a name in the other protocol category (e.g. Alo doesn\u2019t really neatly cluster with Node for example). In addition, there are many names that wouldn\u2019t mesh super well with \u2018Passport\u2019 which I think we\u2019ve been intending to keep right? In general we should always think about how we can build a narrative landscape (consider this a kind of world-building exercise) that is: (a) authentic and true to who we are, meaning it ties back in some way to the ethos and view the community has of us; (b) that deeply defines some set of internal principles we want to live by and intend to enact in the next 5 years; and (c) is easy to expand upon / build lore around with the community over time. To be more practical / tangible I\u2019ll give some more thought to specific names and come back to edit this post later, but first I want to mention some web3 names that I think are very strong in terms of the above framing.   MetaLabel \u2013 Inventive, but allows for the co-creation of a totally new category of ideas that ties back to the core thesis of the product.   Supermodular \u2013 Descriptive, but still elegant and deeply ties back to the concepts at hand, building systems that are positive-sum and help others as they scale.   Juicebox \u2013 Descriptive but also evocative, playful, and gives a sense of why it might actually be enjoyable to raise capital to get the energy you need to build with friends.   Moloch (DAO) \u2013 Evocative, with a rich lore that has been now taken up (by Gitcoin and others) as a key framing for the kinds of coordination problems we\u2019re solving for in web3.   Optimism \u2013 Simple, descriptive (optimistic rollups) yet evocative and striking at the heart of the broader techno-optimist vision their team has for the world.   and to throw in one that\u2019s also plant based but a bit more off the beaten path:   Radicle \u2013 Speaks to the kind of ethos (radical change) their core team wants to see, but also to the way that this happens by setting the very foundations for growth as a radicle does in nature.  Right now none of the names listed feel like they hit the mark for me the same way as these names from close collaborators do, and I think that\u2019s kind of expected as we only had about an hour to go through and brainstorm right before the holidays. I\u2019ll give some thought on my end too and I think the framework that\u2019s been outlined will be super helpful in guiding this further. ",

With regard to the why for each name - it was originally asked that people who write in names also give their reasoning, which we still are missing for quite a number of names in the brainstorm (I too am at fault for this and will work on getting some why\u2019s in there) - so I encourage everyone to contribute to the \u201cwhy\u201d section of the Notion brainstorm. Since these protocols are being named as part of our immediate Gitcoin ecosystem - essentially, our \u201cportfolio,\u201d - attributes of each name would ideally align with our brand characteristics - hence why it was important to discuss these prior to naming:  Knowledgeable not pretentious Relatable not casual Dynamic not brash Intentional not chaotic Generous not overbearing Open not reckless Optimistic not naive Delightful not silly  To @owocki\u2019s point, I think it\u2019s important to recognize we our brand name that is separate from our protocol names (unlike some of the aforementioned web3 brands, like Optimism and Juicebox, whose protocol and brand names are shared.) I\u2019d encourage us to think about how these all fit together, how the protocols share our brand values and personality traits, but also embody their own, which were also shared as part of the brand positioning work: Grants Protocol:  Informative not overkill Flexible not confusing Effective not overpromising Intuitive not lazy Practical not boring  Project Protocol:  Structured not rigid Functional not cold Adaptable not wishy washy Intuitive not lazy Practical not boring  I think a lot of the points raised here come down to brand and product positioning, so I encourage everyone to think about these names in that context. Nowhere in the above do we specifically highlight technical or natural - but they are softly alluded to throughout the traits. Additionally, visual elements will complement these names - the most recent work can be found in the Community Call takeover presentation here, which also brings to life these traits visually and gives a sense of how we might do the same with the protocols. Lastly, I personally dont have the context around the naming process for Passport, but there does seem to be alignment around keeping the name. That said, without that context I don\u2019t know if I can justify holding ourselves to names that best fit. Plus, these protocols while modular can also stand alone. While we don\u2019t want Passport to feel like the one that doesn\u2019t belong, I don\u2019t know if we need to be beholden to the style. Really enjoying these comments and looking forward to more feedback! ",

Aqueducts are a technology that carries an important resource for livelihood (water) from a specific source to a specific destination.

I think QL is fine as a frame of reference\u2026 But if we\u2019re going to do that, then I think we need to commit to this idea, and educating around what it means. I\u2019ve seen the term used in various ways, so I\u2019d love for us to all align on a narrative. What does QL mean to us? Is that how we see a better world, more than it actually being Quadratic Lands (e.g., does it matter if we\u2019re talking about future mechanisms that dont involve QF/QV)? The protocols will live on beyond the short term - how would we describe this concept to someone in the future? Then I think we\u2019d really need to define what each protocol is in the QL framework - so we say Grants Protocol would be our source of support, a lifeforce; and then Project would be the home, the hub - is this 100% accurate? For Project i feel like node is more accurate because its one point in a network. For Grants I feel like it\u2019s not the lifeforce, its the mechanism for coordinating it. What i like about these names is that they are infrastructure concepts - and our protocols are infrastructures. Although some of these names are what gets built on top of the infrastructure. I\u2019d like to see us go more the route that these are the rails, or the tunnels, not the trains (those are the dApps). So, for Grants Protocol, instead of Square-esque words, maybe something more related to infrastructure:  metro municipal groundwork buttress pylon totem lattice trellis  I actually love Aqueduct - do we think that will resonate with developers? Some others for Project Protocol could be  Cornerstone Keystone Linchpin Crossroads Junction Pillar  Also, side note, but if we went that route I love the concept of Blueprint for Grants Stack That said, these feel man-made vs. the more natural and therefore feel slightly in opposition to some of the brand creative - so I\u2019d love @birdsoar\u2019s input here as well. Some that could fall in between:   Cloverleaf: NORTH AMERICAN: a junction of roads intersecting at different levels with connecting sections forming the pattern of a four-leaf clover.  Hatch: an entryway but also the idea of birth, hatching projects  We also haven\u2019t talked about names as action verbs instead of nouns. Hatch could fall into both. Others:   Tend: Like tending a garden, nurturing; gardens are also a source of sustenance  (for Grants)  Fare: Also sustenance, but also to fare well (for Grants)  Spring: A source of sustenance but also to spring into action  Vault: Place to keep valuables/money safe but also leaping to success  Shelter: Like a home but also keeping safe (for Project)  Harbor: Like a place that shelters boats, where they come in and out of/connection to land. from the storm but also to harbor someone is to keep them safe (for Project)  Fort: Like a place for safekeeping but also short for fortify (for Project)  Other comments:  Co it makes me think of Coordinape and I know they\u2019re going to be leaning into the use of Co more. Some of these names (Basecamp, Mint, Box, Square) are used by major tech companies so I suggest we avoid just for brand recognition/ownership purposes I don\u2019t like abode but i like Bode, an allusion to abode but also ties to boding well  Definitely will keep thinking on this but overall liking the direction\u2026 ",

Really resonate with the points made above about finding a conceptual framework like QL to ground our protocols. I feel that the best brand names lend themselves versatility and room for imagination. Some results from my brainstorm for Grants Stack:   topia - latin meaning: place The suffix approach aligns with our core mission as it allows people to envision their own world that they\u2019d like to build with our tools, ie: utopia, ecotopia, technotopia, etc. Other variations for consideration include topias (for plurality), or co-topia (for co-creation, co-existence, coordination, etc)  Copia - latin meaning: abundance, multitude. From co(m)- (\u201ctogether\u201d) +\u200e ops, opis (\u201cpower, ability, resources\u201d) +\u200e -ia (\u201cabstract noun suffix\u201d). The meaning perfectly aligns with our mission, and reinforces ideas related to reservoirs, pluralism, co-existence, etc.  The above names suggest invitations to new worlds to me, and this would tie in our current metaphor with Passport, which we can keep extending to other protocols as well. If Passport is the ticket to another realm, then Project Protocol can be the landmarks, and Grants Protocol the infrastructure that connects these landmarks for the Passport holder to access. ",

The original Gitcoin Aqueduct was described and built to solve the Uniswap problem - \u201cHow might we convince Uniswap to donate 5% of their treasury to public goods for Gitcoin Grantees?\u201d The solution was go back in time and have them commit before their treasury was worth billions (Though Badger did this, and then backed out of the deal\u2026 which is whole other story). The thinking was to find a simple and easy way that DAO/protocols could commit 5% of their treasury early in their project lifecycle and have those stream to a matching pool (technically two) to be used for public goods. So, an aqueduct helps direct some % of funds to a public goods matching pool that grow\u2019s that ecosystem and Public goods more broadly. I really the idea of working QL back into the narrative.

I\u2019ve been leaning into autonomy on this particular subject, and want to float ideas as our discussion evolves. There are some excellent points above around creating compelling names in parallel to some of our close collaborators. I agree with that approach. Names can be unique, descriptive, and playful or serious (depending on context). Achieving all of this in one word is possible, and where we probably want to land. Before diving into to specific names, I\u2019m thinking through this conceptually and want to share ideas around how we can leverage the evolving brand as a framework. To me, Quadratic Lands is solely a community-building piece of lore. Although the mechanism of QF is deeply rooted in our product suite, the lands themselves are about being a utopia. In contrast, our products and protocols are about providing the structure and support required to make that utopia come true. If we look at this from the lens of the evolving brand visuals that our designs reflect, we already have a framework for making conceptual brand decisions:  311920\u00d71080 53.9 KB  I acknowledge that this is a work in progress, and iirc @Etovardesign has ideas for how to translate this framework with a product focus. Still, it\u2019s worth filtering the name options through this framework to see where things land - is the name futuristic? optimistic? earth-aligned? regenerative? etc. All of this helps us relate with the biomemetic magic theme.

Or something like that which does a better job of describing what it does for the users. I\u2019m finding that grantees are already getting pretty confused between grants hub and grants explorer. Im worried we are going to have so many names and some of them not a clear description of the functionality that it will lead to even more confusion. Not going to the same web page to create a grant that you do to apply to a round or donate to a round is going to have a learning curve for sure. I wonder how these decisions will play themselves out in terms of domain names and the flow of traffic between things. I\u2019m a bit confused about which names are being changed and which are not. Is Grants Hub still grants hub? Grants Explorer? Round Manager? I see 3 proposed names here: Grants Stack (replacing grants suit), Alo (replacing grants protocol),  and Node replacing (project protocol). Is the intention for these protocol names to all be public facing? Are the names for the protocols different than the names of the individual tools (and their associated domain names) within these protocols? This honestly feels more confusing as opposed to easier to understand. When describing this to grantees or donors on a twitter space what will they need to know what will we say. Go to grants hub to create your grant and then apply to the round in explorer? Donate to the round in explorer? Find opportunities to get involved in a round\u2026 somewhere? As a round manager what do I need to know? Manage the round in round manager? Support grantees onboarding in grants hub and explorer? The protocols are the overarching infrastructure connecting these pieces together into a cohesive whole. I get that and I\u2019m excited about it. Maybe we are saying as a round manager you will have access to all the tools in the Gitcoin Grants Stack and these are connected using the Alo protocol and the Node protocol? Something like that? Just trying to imagine how I will share information about these new names with our 3 different audiences and what they will need to know to participate. ",

With regard to Grants Hub/Grants Explorer - we won\u2019t be using these names anymore, per my initial note. We will be referring to the different functions within the Grants Stack - but it will all be Grants Stack. See info from my original post:  You may be wondering what happened to previous names: Grants Manager, Grants Explorer, and Grants Hub. Grants Stack is comprised of several dApps built on top of our new protocols plus the Passport integration. These names were for those individual dApps. For now, we\u2019ve aligned to not name the individual dApps, but instead speak to their functionality in the context of the Grants Stack (Manager, Explorer and Builder.) We will no longer be referring to the individual dApp names (although it\u2019s likely just out of habit those names will continue to come up - but we\u2019ll be socializing a robust glossary soon that will reinforce the transition away from these.)  And this:  You might also be wondering why we don\u2019t mention our new protocols - or why they aren\u2019t part of the naming of the Grants Stack. We\u2019ve aligned on not going too far into the underlying tech powering these dApps, as that will be part of the protocol marketing strategy, which is more focused on ecosystem partners and developers at this stage. For this reason, we are thinking about the Grants Stack name separately from the protocol names.  In terms of domain names and navigation, we will look to amend these so it feels cohesive. Additionally, the visuals will also be cohesive across Grants Stack, so it will feel like a seamless experience. This will evolve much more once we are out of Alpha Rounds. Additionally, the marketing of the Grants Protocol will be mainly directed at developers. In terms of how we message this to the end user, it will be more like \u201cGrants Stack - built on our open, permissionless, modular protocols\u201d and then the specifics about the Protocols can be accessed on our website, where devs can also access docs. Hope this helps clarify. ",

I think my favorite of what I have read is Base for the Project Protocol. I go to my Base to strategize and prepare as a grantee. Base also makes me think of a Basecamp. That took my mind to an Expedition.  Groups pool and allocate funds into an Expedition and Grantees start at the Base(camp) and go on Expeditions. Other thoughts along this line of thinking:  Campaign (for all the D&D players) Mission Adventure Voyage  Also, I want to add to what Ben voiced above. We need to think about how this is described in public. Currently, in the Climate Alpha Round, we have a lot of confusion about the Hub and Explorer and what each is for. Grantees go and set up a grant and assume they are done and aren\u2019t trained yet to think now I need to take this grant and apply to the ______ Grant Round Protocol. The names are important but they play heavily into how we describe the overall Grants Stack to the public. ",

                    "content": "So to summarize, the distinction between the two Grants Protocol: (assuming the grants rounds will be run here) A place for pooling resources + community-allocated funding to support projects vs Project Protocol: A place where owners store their project information, build reputation, & apply to various funding rounds To me, the two products described above are both software which directly compliment each other in the same vertical\u2013decentralized, community-oriented funding in web3. A similar comparison to Alphabet\u2019s software offerings could be Google Pay (payment system) vs Google Drive (file storage). They can interact, stand alone, but both still contain Google in the same because they both serve the web-based software vertical. Looking at the slide deck, I can see the argument for Alphabet\u2019s Platform Branding structure, but please remember the company was called Google until 2015, when they began acquiring different companies in order to expand their brand across untouched verticals. However, even in 2023, if you take a look at Google\u2019s product offerings, the most recognized/popular apps on here all have G or Google in the name. We can see that the product names directly appeal to user recognition of Google\u2019s historical reputation by explicitly including Google or G before the function\u2013Gmail, GSuite, Google Maps\u2013and it has been instrumental in each product\u2019s smooth adoption. Also note the other sub brands under Alphabet occupy extremely distinct verticals\u2013ex: Calico - biotech,  Verily - research, Google - software, Nest - hardware, GV - ventures. It took us years to develop the Gitcoin Grants Protocol, and even longer to create a uniquely positive-sum reputation in this chaotic space. Although I have no doubt we have a great roadmap of incoming products, we should first  focus on making this current product suite as successful as possible, not trying to prepare for future products that haven\u2019t even been made yet. As someone who interacts frequently with builders in this space (& I\u2019m sure many contributors relate to this experience), the way people\u2019s face light up when you mention working with Gitcoin   feels incredible and makes me really proud to represent this DAO! Although Gitcoin has existed in the ecosystem for a considerable bit of time, zooming out, we are still incredibly young in our business stage having been founded in 2017. Would warn against imitating the actions of these web2 titans who have been going through many business cycles, product launches, and acquisition since the 90\u2019s/00\u2019s. It would be a shame if premature branding additions diluted the Gitcoin brand, because we have been the forerunners in decentralized funding space. Definitely an OG blue chip brand in web3 funding at this point. Many projects/teams in this space will jump at the opportunity to use Gitcoin-branded, created, tested, & approved software. The branded house structure like Adobe\u2019s or Google\u2019s native apps makes the most sense right now given our product suite offerings + current reputation at this time. But also noticed we already lowkey have a Platform Brand structure with Schelling Point (distinctly different vertical\u2013irl conference event) and supermodular? both not explicitly mentioning Gitcoin in the name (although frequently interacting w/ Gitcoin communities & causes). Although these web2 brand structures are great examples for us to learn and draw inspiration from, we don\u2019t need to imitate. Gitcoin is a unique, recognizable brand name that has plenty of mileage left IMHO. ",

As some of you may have heard, after much discussion around this feedback, MMM and GPC aligned on two final names: Grants Stack (for the set of dApps that act as the interface(s) for our protocols) and Allo Protocol (for Grants Protocol.) We feel these names are mission aligned, positioning aligned, audience aligned, and values aligned. Additionally, both are easy to pronounce, to read/write, and in the case of Allo, is ownable if we choose to trademark it in the future (since Google has abandoned theirs.) Next up, I want to share some additional background on the selection of Allo Protocol** specifically. Beyond aligning with our original naming criteria, this name adequately addresses many of the points made here around function and brand.   Function Forward/Descriptive: It is a direct shorthand for allocate or allocation; thus it directly communicates the primary function, the distribution (resources or duties) for a particular purpose (this is the definition of allocation, and the definition of allocate is TO distribute resources or duties for a particular purpose); we will be dialing up the use of the word allocation in other marketing materials including the marketing brief to ensure this correlation is crystal clear   Mission/Vision/Worldbuilding: Allo and the concept of allocate/allocation ties into our overall mission of empowering the funding/building of shared needs; additionally, it connects to our overarching vision for a better world; if we think about it in the context of existing names, it also complements Passport well (passport being your passport to this world, and allocation being the way you get the funds you need to build what you need to get there) - so in this sense it still maps to the Quadratic Lands meme while simultaneously not undermining the biomemetic magic concept we\u2019re exploring as the evolved brand direction (more info will be shared this week on the brand evolution work)   We felt it was important to give this protocol a name separate from Gitcoin, since the Gitcoin brand is already so much bigger in mission, vision and product landscape vs. that of this particular protocol. That said, we do intend to leverage the credibility and equity of the Gitcoin name across all of our protocols - some of this will be accomplished through certain shared aspects of our overarching Gitcoin brand identity, but will also be done with intentional copy (e.g., saying Gitcoin Allo Protocol when introducing it for the first time, or eventually saying Allo Protocol by Gitcoin - again, more to come here as we finesse these details) Next up we are working on a glossary of terms that will further clarify naming and copy conventions. We will also be sharing updated product information for the Grants Stack and Allo Protocol. You might be wondering - what happened to Project Protocol? For now, as the protocol is in its infancy, it will continue to live almost as part of Allo Protocol until it is ready to be spun out (I welcome @nategosselin, @michelle_ma, @kyle, @kevin.olsen to elaborate here!) Moving forward, we hope to leave even more time for discussion and consideration around things like names and greatly appreciate your continued input! ",
