At most, I think such a list should be used to add context to quantitative signals and ongoing discussions of EIPs (for example, a website searching twitter and github \u201cinfluencers\u201d and their comments on specific EIPs). However, what you\u2019re really suggesting is to use an identity and reputation-based metric when those identity and reputation metrics have not been clearly defined, agreed upon, or legitimized. My suggestion is to focus on the quantitative statistics available via the ethereum blockchain (coin signaling, gas signaling, contract signaling) or services tied to it (hashpower signaling, node operator signaling), as these metrics are exclusive to the ethereum network, are easily understood, are more transparent, and therefore have a less controversial path to be legitimized by the community and accepted by core developers.

How the algorithm works We\u2019ve developed an algorithm that works similar to the original Pagerank. Instead of ranking websites \u2013 we rank identities, instead of tracking links \u2013 we track attention. It\u2019s a 2nd order metric, therefore, the number of followers doesn\u2019t matter much. It matters who these followers are. It\u2019s not just about followers. We\u2019re tracking attention, which is scarce. Following somebody is an indicator of paying attention. One of many. At the moment we\u2019re tracking Twitter, but soon we will combine it with many other sources of data. More here: https://cryptoinfluencers.io/algorithm - a brief description of our algorithm; this page will be gradually expanded with more details http://maciek.blog/what-is-influence - my blog post outlying how we think of influence To address the cons in @MaxSemenchuk post: Majority of them may not be interested to vote This problem applies to any voting system. One could potentially address this by delegating one\u2019s votes and through other approaches. May be prone to bribes One cannot guarantee that no bribery will take place. However, we believe that this approach is less susceptible to this risk than alternatives. The influence scores distribution is subject to Power Laws. The people who have the most voting power, e.g. Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, Joseph Lubin or Gavin Wood are unlikely to be corrupted. May be prone to fake subscribers approach We believe that this system can be Sybil-resistant. It\u2019s based on quantifying attention. Attention is the source of scarcity. To address @decanus concerns: How do you propose to measure technical ability or contributions to the ecosystem otherwise? My belief is that systems tracking ability should be fundamentally divided into: a) Accountability metrics \u2013 they work for use cases that can be accurately quantified, e.g. an investors performance can be quantified accurately through returns. b) Reputation metrics \u2013 they are necessary when things escape direct quantification, therefore can\u2019t be measured with accountability metrics. For example, should surgeons be measured by the number of patients that die/survive on their table? If this was the case, they\u2019d have an incentive to only treat \u201ceasy\u201d patients and avoid serious cases. Whereas if one quantified which experienced surgeons other surgeons want to observe and learn from \u2013 that\u2019s probably a good indication of their expertise. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on how technical ability/contributions can be measured more accurately. To address mattdf concerns: Peter Todd is not on the Ethereum list. You can check the list on our website (tab Ethereum). It sounds to me like what @MaxSemenchuk is proposing is an experiment. I see no reason why it couldn\u2019t be running along with other experiments, e.g. based on the governance system that @decanus is building. In the end, one can evaluate how these multiple experiments performed and it will help inform future decisions regarding governance. ",

If it\u2019s manual then you\u2019ve introduced a highly subjective filter which makes you (the list maintainer) another point of failure/corruption. It\u2019s likely that even people who are deeply involved in the space only know ~10% of the accounts on that list at most, hence it\u2019s not easy to check if someone who shouldn\u2019t be included is there, or vice versa.  It sounds to me like what @MaxSemenchuk is proposing is an experiment.  Best to speak out against ridiculous ideas quickly lest they go too far and start getting taken seriously, for example by people who would take influencer scores as a measure of the quality of a person\u2019s opinions.

Anyone can measure time or clicks related to watching, listening, reading, doing work, completing tasks, sharing ideas, looking for truth, etc. Reputation is multidimensional. We should intelligently use the power of social capital to facilitate coordination. Think about Ken Arrow, Nobel Prize recipient who argued, \u201cIt seems to make no sense to add the utility of one individual, a psychic magnitude in his mind, with the utility of another individual\u201d (1951). However, social scientists often associate Arrow\u2019s \u201cgeneral possibility theorem,\u201d with Condorcet\u2019s \u201cparadox of voting\u201d (1785). Let\u2019s abstract reputation from any single token balance, giving potential value to the multitude of actions we intentionally do in public. Don\u2019t sell your influence. Simply understanding attention will better inform us to make decisions that provide justice and liberty for everyone. Bribery is less likely to happen if we have greater transparency & accountability. Fake traffic is not a new problem, and tokenizing complex signals might actually help. Dimensional voting can be weighted by a specific reputation. Time (a.k.a. validated human proof of energy/work) levels the playing field. It\u2019s possible for token engineers to create hierarchical systems with infinite layers of structured information, i.e blockchains account for everything. We\u2019re objectively representing subjectively-controlled actions/events in order to gain unprecedented common knowledge.

Right now we look to social media to gauge sentiment within the community but on an ad hoc basis that is incredibly imprecise and inefficient. I personally would find something like this list that distills that into a clear signal on an issue a fairly practical solution. I think the fact that this algorithm is closed source and therefore not easily validated or replicated by the community is a huge barrier to legitimacy, and I get the sense that its probably best to focus on on-chain signals first.

The fundamental problem is that by assigning a concrete influence score to influencers you are modifying the very thing you are trying to observe. You create strong incentives for identities to react in ways to specifically modify and monetize the influencer metric.  At the moment we\u2019re tracking Twitter, but soon we will combine it with many other sources of data.  Already this has a serious issue. Twitter is not a public utility. It is not an open platform, it has no transparent governance, and perversely incentivizes gaining influence over audience. Twitter can silently suppress or even censor certain topics and people. What would prevent Twitter itself from doing this to promote its own agenda for an influence score? The other issue is Twitter is not reflective of greater society. It\u2019s very much loved by mainstream and social media users but is not so popular outside of that. Additionally, Twitter has serious issues with both bots and extensive use of block-chains (where you automatically block people based on who they follow, not their interactions with you can lead to severely distorted echo chambers that leads to endless tempests in teapots that blow over within 24 hours. I think even Facebook or Bitcoin Talk) would be fairer.  The influence scores distribution is subject to Power Laws. The people who have the most voting power, e.g. Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, Joseph Lubin or Gavin Wood are unlikely to be corrupted.  The way you prevent corruption is by removing temptation, not by designating moral guardians. If you want to assign influence score, I\u2019d stick to on-chain solutions that are openly verifiable.

Gas Signaling Coin Signaling Hashpower Signaling Node Operator Signaling Influencer Stances  Core Devs Influencer Ranking list Other    Maybe the term Influencer is the problem here. The goal is to collect the current stance of people influential in the community on a specific EIP. Collecting everyone\u2019s would lead to an overwhelming amount if information. Collecting no ones means it is difficult to see how individuals throughout the community stand on a topic. So, we are left with some means of showing a subset of everyone. Having different groups of Stances I hope will highlight that there isn\u2019t one that is more or less valuable then the other. One benefit of the Influencer Ranking list is that it gives a view of a consistent group of individuals across all EIPs. Yes it will change overtime, but at any one point it will be the same list of 300 individuals. This consistency I hope will give an interesting cross section on sentiment around EIPs. One way to curtail gaming a system is to tailor the reward function appropriately. People do not game systems if it is not worth it to them individually. We will continue to work on this, and I am not so tied to it as to not throw it out all together when the time comes. I would like more concrete information through testing before I make any call like that. It is worth pursuing until it isn\u2019t. ",

The fundamental problem is that by assigning a concrete influence score to influencers you are modifying the very thing you are trying to observe. You create strong incentives for identities to react in ways to specifically modify and monetize the influencer metric.  The same argument could be made about impact scores that are used to measure the influence of academic papers. Does this mean that you think they should be abandoned?  Already this has a serious issue. Twitter is not a public utility. It is not an open platform, it has no transparent governance, and perversely incentivizes gaining influence over audience. Twitter can silently suppress or even censor certain topics and people. What would prevent Twitter itself from doing this to promote its own agenda for an influence score?  We share these concerns about using Twitter. That\u2019s the reason this is only a starting point and our objective is to start using multiple sources of data as soon as possible. I\u2019d rather use a decentralized source, but there does not seem to be a better alternative at this point.  The other issue is Twitter is not reflective of greater society. It\u2019s very much loved by mainstream and social media users but is not so popular outside of that.  It\u2019s not used by the \u201cgreater society\u201d, but it has a high penetration within the crypto community. And that\u2019s enough to start with. We believe that this is the first time a score like this can be built. And this is due to the peculiar nature of the crypto ecosystem. It\u2019s the first \u2018global first, local second\u2019 ecosystem. This means that significantly more communication happens online within this community, compared to say, a startup ecosystem. This leads us to believe that it might be possible to collect enough data to assess influence probabilistically. We believe that crypto will \u201ceat the world\u201d. If this is the case, then the solutions that work in this community will spill over to other sectors.  Additionally, Twitter has serious issues with both bots and extensive use of block-chains (where you automatically block people based on who they follow, not their interactions with you can lead to severely distorted echo chambers that leads to endless tempests in teapots that blow over within 24 hours. I think even Facebook or Bitcoin Talk) would be fairer.  Twitter has many issues. However, the examples you brought up have not been problematic so far in our experience. I don\u2019t see how Facebook could be a better source of data for this purpose. We don\u2019t exclude the possibility of using BitcoinTalk.  The way you prevent corruption is by removing temptation, not by designating moral guardians.  I think I was not clear in my comment about corruption. We don\u2019t claim to solve this problem. What I intended to point out was that people with strong reputation have more at stake, therefore should be less likely to accept bribes (or at least the cost of bribery should increase).  If you want to assign influence score, I\u2019d stick to on-chain solutions that are openly verifiable. I do think an influencer score causes more issues than it solves.  I\u2019m not aware of any on-chain solution that solves the problem we\u2019re addressing. I\u2019d love to change my mind on this, so feel free to educate me. Besides, our goal is to open-source our algorithm and decentralize its governance. We just believe that starting in a centralized model and decentralizing once we prove that it can work increases chances of success.  Besides, influencers already have influence. That\u2019s why they\u2019re influencers! If they want people to vote a certain way, they can influence them to do so and that would be a far more accurate measure of their social influence than any metric we could come up with.  Good point. One can even think of this as a form of \u201cvoting with attention\u201d. Many governance models run into the problem that few voters participate. Even with delegated voting. In this case, delegation happens naturally and is predicated on one\u2019s self-interest. E.g. let\u2019s say there is a group of physicists. Each one of them has limited attention. They can dedicate it to their own thinking or reading each other\u2019s papers. The optimal strategy is to spend some of it on your own work and dedicate some to keeping track of important ideas produced by others. This is likely going to lead to the following outcome: those regarded as producing the highest quality thinking will accumulate disproportionally more attention than those producing low-quality thinking. This distribution is predicated on self-interest \u2013 i.e. I\u2019m reading papers that I think will benefit my work. Arguably, the same dynamics applies to other groups. Including open-source developers. Centralized networks (e.g. corporations, governments, armies), can make quick decisions because it\u2019s clear who holds power*. The problem with decentralized networks is that there is nobody who does. There are people who have influence, however. There is just no way (yet) of telling who they are and how much influence they have. Our hypothesis is that if there is a reliable way of quantifying this influence it opens up possibilities for removing this weakness. This would make decentralized networks even more compelling. *Power is influence with agency. ",

As is, I spend an inordinate amount of time undoing the Bitcoin propaganda that miner desires matter, if you create a metric for \u201cminer desires\u201d it makes my (self assigned) job of reminding people of this fact significantly harder.  They will just point at the metrics and checkout. You can see this in society today, people point at statistics from academic papers in political debates all the time without any consideration for context, nuance, etc.  By making bad data available in a nice format, many people will prefer to use that as a primary decider rather than understanding the issue. We should be working on making it easier for people to understand the arguments and nuance, not making it easier for them to mentally check out. ",
