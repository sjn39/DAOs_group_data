                    "content": "This document is an initial proposal for review following the application from the Gnosis team (@Karpatkey) for the addition of GNO as a collateral type. Nothing in this document represents a commitment and is merely guidance at this stage to help frame next steps in the discussion. Any agreement to parameters will be for initial purposes only. MakerDAO can freely alter GNO-A vault parameters if it is necessary based on the opinion of Governance or mandated actors.  Scope of the Agreement  Introduction of GNO-A vault in MCD GnosisDAO continuation of borrowing activity with highly liquid decentralized assets (ie. stEth) in MCD Further development in a second phase through joint collaboration efforts of DAI ecosystem, liquidity and user base within GnosisDAO controlled projects including but not limited to Gnosis Chain (GC).   Vault Parameters Following the initial analysis, the following parameters for the GNO-A vault are proposed and will be further explained in more detail in the [GNO] Risk Assessment to be published by Risk CU (@Risk-Core-Unit ).  DC-IAM Line (max DC): 5M Liquidation ratio: 350% Stability fee: 2.5%   Commitments GnosisDAO  Remain an active MCD vault user with decentralized highly liquid assets including ETH and its liquid staking derivatives available as collateral. Maintain no less than 75% of GnosisDAO stablecoin borrowing activities with highly liquid assets excluding possible recursive farming activity in lending markets in MCD. GnosisDAO will conduct the majority of its stablecoin borrowing volume with Maker. Utilize the GNO-A debt ceiling as soon as possible, Maker prefers the majority of available debt ceiling to be utilized at all times.  ",

And as @Saludiego_201 noted, a 350% liquidation ration suggests a lack of confidence in the token liquidity. That increases the likelihood this will turn into a troubled asset that requires disproportionate DAO attention. ",

They are committing to remain using other Vaults, in fact they hold a decent wsETH-A Vault, the parameters seems fair for a little collateral like this one and they seem to be a team willing to REALLY work with us, we can\u2019t be just pushing away opportunities like this, in the very first place being just in Mainnet and not having a super smooth liquidation system is what put us in this situation with tons of stablecoins backing DAI, the first whole idea of MCD was getting as much crypto/decentralize coins as possible.

As you said, the liquidation ratio it\u2019s because of the token\u2019s liquidity, and as a general rule we don\u2019t use to onboard this type of tokens, but I think it\u2019s important to make exceptions, especially if it\u2019s for a partner that it\u2019s aligned with Maker:  GnosisDAO is committing to maintaining no less than 75% of their stablecoin borrowing activities with Maker. Currently, they have a 25m debt position using stETH They are also helping us to increase DAI demand as the Gnosis chain uses DAI for fees. They are one of the main liquidity providers of DAI in bridges like Hop. As always, it\u2019s up to MKR holders to decide if we should onboard it or not, but we think it\u2019s worth it to consider it.  ",
