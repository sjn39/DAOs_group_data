                    "content": "Summary In dealing with RWA, either the risk team contributors and/or the Maker Representatives will have access to undisclosed information that will be under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Sharing information with the governance/community would therefore not be possible. This NDA will not be with MakerDAO (as the DAO is not able to sign one). Any breach would lead to legal actions against those community members. Examples For instance, in the covenant structure, there is a formula to compute the collateralization ratio. The inputs of this formula are under NDA (things like location of the properties, credit score of the lenders, \u2026). At most, only the result will be shared with the community. For instance, this is a possible outcome of a covenant assessment:  The collateralization ratio is currently at 104% which is below the liquidation ratio of 105% because some loans are at risk, therefore the risk team will trigger the liquidation.  For Centrifuge assets, there is also a public ratio (the TIN/DROP ratio). But the underlying model can be different (hence different results). The same issue arises on our partners due diligence. For instance, the risk team might provide an assessment like the following one, without the data to verify it.  The risk team has assessed that the asset originator is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months. This impression is based on an analysis of bank statements and internal forecast models from the company.  Do you agree to trust the risk domain team to do risk assessment without providing the underlying data due to NDA?     Yes, agree No, don\u2019t agree Abstain     0 voters     If successful (yes winning and enough quorum), this poll will be bundled with all RWA polls in a on-chain governance poll for governance validation.

For example, it would be much better for the DAO, generally speaking if:  The secret data/document could be Hashed/Fingerprinted and (cryptographically) signed by the risk team contributors and/or the Maker Representatives, and posted in the forum (and in a public ledger like Ethereum). This NDA data could be released to the public after a certain agreed amount of time (e.g., 6months/2y/5y/etc ) so everybody can transparently check (just after some time) that things were done properly by the Maker Representatives.  Ideally (maybe not now, because we are still not organised, but in the future), we should find incentives for good behaviours. For example: team contributors and/or the Maker Representatives should be rewarded for their work but only after the verification step (2 above) has been successfully passed. ",

                    "content": "I feel there are some unresolved issues. First of all we should keep the role of the Maker risk team separate from the role of Maker representative. This is simply due to the legal issues that could arise from having a representative role. It will be much harder for Maker to recruit the much needed brainpower needed for Risk if these run the risk of ending up in legal problems. This does however leave us with problems when resolving breaches. Let us use your above example: Some generic asset originator has a non disclosure agreement as well as a liquidation ratio of 105%. One day the manager in charge of crypto leaves for vacation and someone thought it was a good idea to borrow some extra DAI in order to improve the quarterly figures. As a result the collateralization ratio dropped to 104% resulting in a breach of the terms. This breach is reported. Now the Maker community must make a decision to whether or not liquidate the SPV assets. The problem is that they have no information on which to base the decision. The Maker representative has a non disclosure and cannot provide any information and the company itself cannot give up any additional data on this. The community have no information whatsoever and the end result is a blind decision. Alternatively we give the Maker representatives some wiggle room. We could for example say that with in 48 hours of breach detection the Maker representatives would have to issue a statement where they recommend one of three choices.  Immediate liquidation Allow 48 hours to repair breach. If not successful->liquidation. Do nothing  This allows some human steering and might prevent unnecessary and costly liquidations. On the downside it costs braincells. The first method could be much more messy but will allow for full or nearly full automation of the process, allowing much more scale. ",

But I really like your idea to store some data in a non readable way and have a formula that can work on that (I think it is possible not 100% sure). Something like, \u201cgiven these inputs, output 104% of collateralization ratio\u201d. If something is important for the community to be aware of, it is always possible to find a way with the data owner (asset originator) to allow some specific sharing. But we shouldn\u2019t take it as a given. For instance, I don\u2019t think one should care that the the Starbuck around the corner in Nashville is in the portfolio and hasn\u2019t pay its rent. What might be interesting is knowing that the value of the portfolio is decreasing because of its exposure to auto dealers that are hit hard by XYZ reason. I guess you can expect the same level of disclosure that any public company. I fully agree that the risk team / Maker representative should be rewarded/penalized. Not clear how to do that. As seen with the subprimes, it\u2019s difficult to assess. @Planet_X We had this debate inside Risk on the difference between a risk contributor and a Maker representative. This remains somewhat an open question. It is not possible to perform a risk assessment without an NDA. At some point, Maker will most likely have a legal entity devoted to RWA stuff so the legal risk will be on that entity and no longer the risk contributor and/or Maker representative. It is also difficult/painful to work between risk contributors on sensible data as NDA are on an individual level. The second part on having some wiggle room is taken care of with the discrete liquidiation on the post [Poll] RWA Working Group - Covenant structure. So far, the community is okay with that. Let me know if you had something else in mind. ",

As long as that \u201cmarket intelligence\u201d that is released doesn\u2019t come from confidential sources, I agree.     SebVentures:  It is not possible to perform a risk assessment without an NDA.   This part I would challenge. If we separate the transactional risk and the credit risk, virtually all of the credit risk can be done without an NDA. (e.g. no NDA needed to research the credit viability of Maersk or a credit tenant for a net-lease deal. Most of that information is public and can be reviewed by credit agencies that have done most of the heavy lifting.) Now if MKR starts to want to lend against complex \u201crated\u201d legal structures that have multi-tranched securitizations, then yes, research is needed to know what you are lending against.     SebVentures:  The second part on having some wiggle room is taken care of with the discrete liquidiation on the post [Poll] RWA Working Group - Covenant structure . So far, the community is okay with that. Let me know if you had something else in mind.   Let\u2019s also not forget that in the Credit Agreement (between a LendCo and a Trust) a cure period will be defined (as is industry standard). For sure the Maker Representative, should use his / her discretion, but we must also remember the difference between technical breach and material breach. This is why cure periods have been in contracts for decades to allow oversights to be remedied. ",

I think the real question here is whether someone from risk teams needs to be on the NDA and provide their input.   If I had to answer this from a MKR side I\u2019d say yes.   But then the risk assessment falls in other hands as then the risk assessment no longer not the formal duty of the Maker Rep but a Maker risk team associate.   Which would beg a question.  What are going to be the necessary qualifications of a Maker Rep if we are going to have to have a legal rep, risk rep, etc. other reps.   Maybe the Maker Representative needs to be a RWA team composed of a number of experts. ",

In my mind, the Maker rep is having a risk role for Maker (even very limited). The risk team might also be a support function for the Maker Rep. Even if a third party is doing the evaluation, we might want to check that. For instance, each asset originator has a due diligence on borrowers. But we need to check that (by sampling or whatever). Moreover we need to conduct a due diligence on those asset originators themselves (as per the covenant structure). ",

                    "content": "Hope I am not commenting too late on this topic      mrabino1:  If we separate the transactional risk and the credit risk, virtually all of the credit risk can be done without an NDA. (e.g. no NDA needed to research the credit viability of Maersk or a credit tenant for a net-lease deal. Most of that information is public and can be reviewed by credit agencies that have done most of the heavy lifting.)   @mrabino1 In terms of assessment of credit risk, I would still challenge the notion of a non-NDA required here. If not an NDA, at least the idea of consent from the business enquired. While it\u2019s true that credit information can be obtained on most companies big enough to have a credit rating, for some SMEs included in the underlying portfolios this is not necessarily the case. Besides, usually the credit risk is not only on the legal entity but also on its directors and other possible associated entities. Involvement of directors along with source of wealth, income and assets can be determinant in the health of an SME under a stressed scenario. In this case, information would indeed require consent, if not on the legal entity at least on the directors\u2019 credit risk.     iammeeoh:  The secret data/document could be Hashed/Fingerprinted and (cryptographically) signed by the risk team contributors and/or the Maker Representatives, and posted in the forum (and in a public ledger like Ethereum).   @iammeeoh I believe technically, this would be possible, although with some tweaks. There are distributed mechanisms for hashing and storing data in components like IFPS or BigchainDB which may guarantee some level of certificate on chain representing the underlying granular information. Future proving, homomorphic encryption may play a role here too, without data disclosure at all (not mature yet and computationally too expensive). Legally, and to an extent technically, though I do not think this would be feasible this early in the game to place such a burden on AOs and integrators such as Centrifuge. ",
