PROBLEM Uniswap is built on the concept of liquidity pools. more liquidity means more stable prices and therefore healthier pairs. coins are locked in these pools for great lengths of time. One of those pairs is UNIETH, with currently ~5.6 million UNI locked up in the pool. The problem I see is that currently it is not possible to vote with pooled UNI. in order to vote, one would have to leave the pool altogether and repurpose their UNI to the vote. on a personal level this leaves us with a problem, where we have to choose between pulling out and voting at the risk of loss, or not voting on a topic that we would actually care about. On a macro scale, the setup is forcing us to choose between either a stable pool or using the tokens for their intended purpose. I believe this problem is quite substantial as ideally we would be doing both. the pools are what gives uniswap its title as the top dex out there and the governance is a great leap forward, yet the UNI coin in effect is incompatible with the platform\u2019s own core defining feature. SOLUTION allow us to stake our LP tokens in a voting contract which returns us some sort of IOU token useful for votes and delegation, conservatively representing our share in the UNI pool (like, factoring in slippage by calculating our pool share at 80% of a holder\u2019s UNI share at the time of staking). This way we can actually hold UNI, strengthen the pair and do our part in the governance of uniswap by propsing and casting votes. This proposal needs thought and development, its easier said than done to just create a vote staking mechanism, not to mention it will probably include updating the current vote contracts. therefore a part of my proposal would be to free up adequate funding from the treasury to compensate the team for time put into making this work.

I equally presume that bringing up the issue in the community call is a prime step. The technicality behind the adoption will ideally become a matter of community contribution at least, and it could pass as a proposal if the puzzle is solved. ",

Plus as there is competitors in this sector you have tonalways be competitive and attract investors liquidity. So being able to invest in lp and votes should be very helpfull. Concerning how value lp UNI locked it can be a fixed percentage (example 75%) . So holders vote will be considered as more important ? ",

I wrestle with how accurate Uniswap\u2019s voting model is reflective of UNI holders interests both in the short and long term. In the short term Uniswap has historically been one of the most fair token distributions in the crypto space.   My concern is with whale pump/dumps around the time a vote would pass.  The UNI Token purchase would move the token value granted their was an entity up for that task. In the long term,  I see UNI tokens flat out being collected quietly and have the power to sway voting predictably or actively work in opposition of the Uniswap community as a whole.  Or, on the otherhand,  hemmorage the UNI token value and sizzle to other projects in 2 or so years in the UNI Community does not stay competitive.  Decentralized governance takes more work at an individual level staying tuned and the decision making process more arduous. ",
