Our guests will first discuss the MIP6 process by reviewing the framework for fact-based assessments and the role of RWF core unit(s) within the process. The team will then explore comparable aspects of TradFi Structured Finance Transactions and how the roles of borrowers & lenders translate to MakerDAO\u2019s MIP6 framework. The team will conclude with a review of an off market transaction example, with a deep dive into specific metrics. The community will have a chance to have their questions answered at the end of the presentation.  Join us!  @juan & @retro will host.
