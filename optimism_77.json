When it comes to governance, I think it\u2019s important to consider the level of decentralization for the council of delegates. It\u2019s also prudent to consider the underlying connections and attachments of the delegates and whether there are conflicting views, biases or other. I suspect the vast majority will remain ethical and mindful of their influence. However, we must not inherently place trust in groups or persons in this industry \u2014 or most other industries. Trust should be earned and visibility does not equate to a consistent trust factor. Verifiable actions, words and results are the foremost indicator for trust. With that being said, it will become easier in time to recognize honest actors active within governance. By sharing our opinions and being consistent with ethics, morals and virtues, it becomes much easier to express ourselves and critique one another\u2014 without much fears of being shunned, turned away directly or discouraged. If anyone doesn\u2019t feel they can give enough time to direct governance, I\u2019m more than willing to step up and be a delegate. I take pride in my work in general and governance is one component of this space that drew me in and got me hooked.  I did write a blurb on the delegates commitment page: Delegate Commitments - #117 by knowledgeable-idiot ",
