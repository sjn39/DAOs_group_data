Contribute to unifra20/solidity-now development by creating an account on GitHub.      Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: yes.  solidity now. developers from ETH baselayer would know if their contract can run smoothly on op. and we will give them hint if don\u2019t. L2 notify will significantly reduce the development time for developers who want to know their txs status on particular L2.  Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: L2 notify is an out of box tool for developer to use. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: this I am not sure. but lowering the developing cost for developers for sure.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): NPM download time Who are your competitors?: none What differentiates you from your competitors?: there is no such service available in the market atm Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: not sure. Team Who are your founders?: team from well known tech companies and universities What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: we have already delivered initial results. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): alibaba cloud, ant financial, Is this your first Web3 project?: yes If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post : [Yes/No]: yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: 12 months Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 30k How do you justify the size of the grant? development cost and maintenance Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:  image1770\u00d71172 140 KB   image1438\u00d71176 71 KB   image1846\u00d71130 135 KB  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) N/A Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: we will be better supported since this is a public good and community-driven effort. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: better support the funding of unifra network Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. \u2013please see above screenshots Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: yes. EVM compatibility check tools pre-integrated with hardhat. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: EVM compatibility check tools pre-integrated with hardhat. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: yes. bring more solidity developers to op ecosystem. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: yes. we are bullish on op future growth especially after the coinbase partnership. Is your project Optimism Native?: no. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: yes ",
