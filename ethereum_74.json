The standard is kept very generic to allow the industry to evolve new ecosystems that can all rely on the same basic standard at their core.

                    "content": "There is no accepted standard mechanism to license a work, or to represent it, except using traditional NFTs. But regular NFTs only represent a collectible item use case, and cannot easily represent more complicated use cases of licensing a work for different types of uses. To enable such mechanisms, we need a more robust mechanism for : Declaring that a work exists, SEPARATE from its purchase ability Declaring possibly multiple interested parties to be paid for such work  for #1 no standard exists today. For #2 we only have regular splits standards based on NFT purchases, or through mechanisms like 0xsplits. While these are a great headstart, they do not contain the ability to name multiple types of collaboration participants, and more importantly, do not contain an easy way to manage the splits in a way that feels natural. With this proposal, registration is taken care of, and splits are taken care of by defining the splits as an open array of EIP-20 tokens that represent split percentages. Moving splits to various participants will be as simple as sending an EIP-20 token from one wallet to another. discovering split movements is as simple as checking EIP-20 transfer events. In the future, we can build full payout mechanisms based on these simple split tokens, and licensing standards on top of those payout mechanisms, which are not possible today due to the complexity of splits management in the traditional web2 world.

This standard provides basic functionality to create, transfer, and revoke licenses, and to determine the current licensing state of an NFT. The standard does not define the legal details of the license. Instead, it provides a structured framework for recording licensing details.  We consider use cases of NFT creators who wish to give the NFT holder a copyright license to use a work associated with the NFT. The license can optionally be revoked under conditions specified by the creator. The holder of an active license can issue sublicenses to others to carry out the rights granted under the license.       This file has been truncated. show original      ",
