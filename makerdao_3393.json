Welcome to another session of Core Unit Tools. This one is number 4. Today I\u2019m happily joined by a bunch of Maker people, and we have Otonomos and OtoCo, Han and Daan, that have joined us. Hopefully we can go through what they do, how they can help Core Units, and the important questions that anyone may have. For other episodes of Core Unit Tools, please check the forum.   Presentation (00:38)   Han, Daan, and  1920\u00d71080 79.2 KB   09:31 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: You just mentioned Wyoming and Delaware, but on your website it seems that you cover many more jurisdictions. I was wondering why. And the second questions that I have is, let\u2019s say any US citizen wants to start providing services for the DAO. How would that work?   17:12 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Maybe you can cover a general example. Let\u2019s say Frank wants to start a Core Unit in the US and wants to hire two more people, one in the US and one in Germany. What would he need to get this running?   19:47 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I guess that anything that has to do with dealing with the administration and the legal and the paperwork, he would have to take care of that \u2014 it\u2019s not something that you\u2026   23:05 \u2014 Nadia \u00c1lvarez: We have been talking with Opolis; they are a payroll system and they are able to pay others in crypto. One of their suggestions was that, even if you\u2019re a contractor, you should create your own LLC. So, I was wondering: maybe these instruments of creating an LLC through you it\u2019s not just for the Core Units but it also could be for every contractor that will provide services to that Core Unit, right?   25:44 \u2014 David Utrobin: My questions was about the breadth of services that your organization offers. I know you mentioned payroll, I know you mentioned the creation of the entity and presumably the destruction of the entity if it\u2019s needed\u2026 I\u2019m curious if you also offer things like accounting, creation of bank accounts, that kind of management \u2014 and just generally I\u2019m curious about what else I might have missed   27:53 \u2014 David Utrobin: I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around how I would use your service, but then also\u2026 Because as a person who is proposing a Core Unit, I am cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s going to\u2026 you know, probably be a need to set up some accounting, there\u2019s going to be a need to set up payroll in some cases, maybe not in all cases\u2026   1920\u00d71080 91.9 KB   1920\u00d71080 65.7 KB   1920\u00d71080 55 KB   1920\u00d71080 66.7 KB   1920\u00d71080 66.2 KB   1920\u00d71080 181 KB   1920\u00d71080 75.4 KB   42:17 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you import a Gnosis wallet that\u2019s been already created?   1920\u00d71080 68.7 KB   45:16 \u2014 Frank Cruz: With regards to the operating agreement, when you\u2019re creating an LLC, is there an opportunity for you\u2026 Say you have a partner and you\u2019re going 50-50, or three partners and it\u2019s 33-33-33. Is there a chance to put that in the operating agreement or no, you have to do it with the token deployment?   47:39 \u2014 Kim: When you were going through your example there, the part where everybody got a chance to see that PDF, are those PDFs available for people to review before we actually go through the process?   Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro  If people have more questions or they are interested in starting something or doing a follow-up session with you, what\u2019s the best way of reaching out? (50:35) Thank you for joining us. You\u2019ll probably be hearing from some of us soon   Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.
