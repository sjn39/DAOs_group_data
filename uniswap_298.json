UNI drop rewarded Uniswap users and Uniswap liquidity providers, especially those who were active during the early days. However, I feel that some people which contributed a lot to the Uniswap success were left aside: software developers and content creators. People who wrote code (and made it public for free) to interact with and analyse Uniswap, writers spreading the word about Uniswap, when whole idea of AMM exchanges should be offered some UNI for their work. I don\u2019t have any concrete proposal, but I think at least some of those contributions should be included in UNI distribution. I\u2019d like to open a discussion if and how this should be done. PS. Perhaps also some fund should be created for content/software creators in the future. ",
