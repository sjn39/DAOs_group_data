                    "content": " Consensus Check - Add 1 Basis Point Fee Tier Prior discussion Snapshot poll  TLDR: Uniswap should add a 1bps fee tier with 1 tick spacing. This change is straightforward from a technical perspective and would help Uniswap compete in stablecoin <> stablecoin pairs, where the majority of the market share is taken by Curve and DODO.  Background on pool fees Uniswap v3 allows for the creation of new pools via calls to the factory contract. In order to keep liquidity for pairs consolidated, only a few fee options are allowed\u2013currently, 5, 30, and 100 basis points are supported (10, 60, 200 tick spacing). Governance should add a 1 basis point fee option for the following reasons:  Curve\u2019s stablecoin markets have 3-4 bps fees. Dodo\u2019s stablecoin markets have a 1 bps fee. FTX\u2019s fees for retail are 2/7bps fees and for whales 0/4bps.  However, we recognize there are some potential counterarguments to adding this fee tier:  Adding too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity. Liquidity providers may earn less in fees.   We discuss each of these points in greater detail below This will allow for the creation of much more competitive stablecoin<>stablecoin pools. Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs in AMMs is generally easier than other pairs due to their relatively low price volatility. As such, the determining factor in driving volume is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won\u2019t necessarily make Uniswap v3\u2019s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as Curve\u2019s 3pool (3 bps fees) and DODO\u2019s USDC-USDT pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO. Very little of it is routed to Uniswap v3.  2804\u00d7688 166 KB  In the DEX market as a whole (not just 1inch), DODO and Curve still take the majority of the market share (60-70%) in USDC-USDT trading. Uniswap v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity helped increase market share, but lower fees can help it grab more.  2804\u00d7688 162 KB  The data tells a similar story for DAI-USDC (see 1inch exported volume and overall market share), though in the case of DAI-USDC, DODO is less active. While the case is compelling just from competition in the DEX space, Uniswap also competes with centralized exchanges. Many centralized exchanges offer lower than 5 basis point taker fees for high volume traders (Binance offers < 5 basis point fees above 40K BTC in 30-day volume, FTX above $25M in 30-day volume, etc.). Lower fees could increase the DEX volume pie by comparing favorably to spot markets on centralized exchanges and drawing volume from large players.  The change is a very light touch. The change requires just one function call\u2013enableFeeAmount(100)\u2013on the factory contract. Governance controls this contract, so a simple proposal could make this change. The enableFeeAmount function takes as parameters  Fee: the fee amount denominated in 100ths of a basis point.  tickSpacing: the granularity one may specify a liquidity range (see the Uniswap v3 Core whitepaper for more details)  To add a 1 basis point fee option, fee would be 100. tickSpacing requires some consideration. On the one hand, too high of a value restricts LPs\u2019 ability to set granular prices, since initializable price ticks would be roughly [tickSpacing] basis points apart. On the other hand, too low of a value could entail liquidity being too low in each tick, meaning that larger orders may need to cross multiple ticks to fill, entailing extra gas cost for each additional tick. We suggest that a value of 1 for tickSpacing would be reasonable for 1 basis point fee pools, allowing LPs to set prices with precision in positions that span ~1 basis point between initializable ticks. For a stablecoin market like USDC-USDT, we expect most of the liquidity to reside in 6 ticks. Orders <$1m will like only require 1 tick and larger orders may require a second or third tick. For each tick used it adds about 15k-20k gas costs.  Too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity The downside of adding too many fee tier possibilities is that liquidity is then fragmented across pools. However, we believe that LPs will naturally settle over time into the fee tier that is most appropriate for the volatility of the pair. Pairs with particularly low volatility, like stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs, will likely have a liquidity migration to the 1 bps tier, as the required return to capital should be low in equilibrium given the low risk of impermanent loss.  LPs may earn less in fees Assuming overall volume stays stable (although it\u2019s worth mentioning more competitive fees should grow the pie), total fees paid will go down (volume would have to 5X for fees paid to LPs to stay the same). However, LPs are not the only constituency to take into consideration\u2013takers will be paying lower fees in aggregate. Growing Uniswap\u2019s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. These pools could become more enticing to large traders looking to swap stablecoins, for instance.  Concluding Thoughts We believe this simple change could boost Uniswap\u2019s competitiveness in low volatility pairs, and the change presents minimal risk for Uniswap. We welcome any thoughts on this idea from the community. ",

We feel that, since there is little downside, more optionality is better than less, especially considering Uniswap\u2019s current minimum rate of 5% being uncompetitive compared to DODO and Curve. We agree that Uniswap should strive to be the one-stop shop for all swaps, including stablecoins. The mindset of creating a great trading experience to attract large organic volumes, which is recursively followed by more LPs and TVL is one we subscribe to. Our only reservation is that 1% may be a little too low. A 2% bps rate may allow Uniswap to find a middle ground between competing with Curve and DODO, whilst also having enough margin for LPs to consider this profitable. Indeed, we must think carefully about how this change could affect the market landscape. A race to the bottom in fee levels amongst DEXes is suboptimal. We need to carefully discern what number will create long-term sustainable and organic volume, and sticky TVL from satisfied LPs. It would be interesting to see some data or backtesting on pricing efficiencies with TVL, fee levels, and order sizes as the independent variables. We will vote yes on this Consensus Check, but do wish our above suggestions are addressed. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @pennblockchain, I\u2019d also like to add a few comments to the discussion of the exact choice of the new fee option:  \u201cA 2% bps rate may allow Uniswap to find a middle ground between competing with Curve and DODO, whilst also having enough margin for LPs to consider this profitable.\u201d  With the current sizes of stablecoin pools, slippage is negligible compared to trading fees for most trades. This means that lowering fees from 5bps to 2bps when competing with a 1bps pools will not help much - the 1bps pool will still be the optimal choice in most cases.  \u201cA race to the bottom in fee levels amongst DEXes is suboptimal.\u201d  Interestingly, competition among AMM pools does not necessarily lead to a race to the bottom (see our paper for more details). For the stablecoin pools in question, one would expect fees to decrease (and possibly TVL to decline) until slippage is no longer negligible compared to trading fees. Then pool fees would converge to an equilibrium. Finally, my personal opinion: Thinking for the long term, fee levels should be chosen to give LPs a wide range of options while also not fragmenting liquidity too much. From this perspective, 2 and 5 bps pools seem too close together to me and the options 1, 5, 30, 100 seem better spread than 2, 5, 30, 100. ",

                    "content": " Proposal - Add 1 Basis Point Fee Tier Consensus Check | Snapshot  TLDR: Uniswap should add a 1bps fee tier with 1 tick spacing. This change is straightforward from a technical perspective and would help Uniswap compete in stablecoin <> stablecoin pairs, where the majority of the market share is taken by Curve and DODO.  Background on pool fees Uniswap v3 allows for the creation of new pools via calls to the factory contract. In order to keep liquidity for pairs consolidated, only a few fee options are allowed\u2013currently, 5, 30, and 100 basis points are supported (10, 60, 200 tick spacing). Governance should add a 1 basis point fee option for the following reasons:  Curve\u2019s stablecoin markets have 3-4 bps fees. Dodo\u2019s stablecoin markets have a 1 bps fee. FTX\u2019s fees for retail are 2/7bps fees and for whales 0/4bps.  However, we recognize there are some potential counterarguments to adding this fee tier:  Adding too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity. Liquidity providers may earn less in fees.   We discuss each of these points in greater detail below This will allow for the creation of much more competitive stablecoin<>stablecoin pools. Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs in AMMs is generally easier than other pairs due to their relatively low price volatility. As such, the determining factor in driving volume is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won\u2019t necessarily make Uniswap v3\u2019s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as Curve\u2019s 3pool (3 bps fees) and DODO\u2019s USDC-USDT pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO. Very little of it is routed to Uniswap v3.  2804\u00d7688 166 KB  In the DEX market as a whole (not just 1inch), DODO and Curve still take the majority of the market share (60-70%) in USDC-USDT trading. Uniswap v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity helped increase market share, but lower fees can help it grab more.  2804\u00d7688 162 KB  The data tells a similar story for DAI-USDC (see 1inch exported volume and overall market share), though in the case of DAI-USDC, DODO is less active. While the case is compelling just from competition in the DEX space, Uniswap also competes with centralized exchanges. Many centralized exchanges offer lower than 5 basis point taker fees for high volume traders (Binance offers < 5 basis point fees above 40K BTC in 30-day volume, FTX above $25M in 30-day volume, etc.). Lower fees could increase the DEX volume pie by comparing favorably to spot markets on centralized exchanges and drawing volume from large players.  The change is a very light touch. The change requires just one function call\u2013enableFeeAmount(100)\u2013on the factory contract. Governance controls this contract, so a simple proposal could make this change. The enableFeeAmount function takes as parameters  Fee: the fee amount denominated in 100ths of a basis point.  tickSpacing: the granularity one may specify a liquidity range (see the Uniswap v3 Core whitepaper for more details)  To add a 1 basis point fee option, fee would be 100. tickSpacing requires some consideration. On the one hand, too high of a value restricts LPs\u2019 ability to set granular prices, since initializable price ticks would be roughly [tickSpacing] basis points apart. On the other hand, too low of a value could entail liquidity being too low in each tick, meaning that larger orders may need to cross multiple ticks to fill, entailing extra gas cost for each additional tick. We suggest that a value of 1 for tickSpacing would be reasonable for 1 basis point fee pools, allowing LPs to set prices with precision in positions that span ~1 basis point between initializable ticks. For a stablecoin market like USDC-USDT, we expect most of the liquidity to reside in 6 ticks. Orders <$1m will like only require 1 tick and larger orders may require a second or third tick. For each tick used it adds about 15k-20k gas costs.  Too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity The downside of adding too many fee tier possibilities is that liquidity is then fragmented across pools. However, we believe that LPs will naturally settle over time into the fee tier that is most appropriate for the volatility of the pair. Pairs with particularly low volatility, like stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs, will likely have a liquidity migration to the 1 bps tier, as the required return to capital should be low in equilibrium given the low risk of impermanent loss.  LPs may earn less in fees Assuming overall volume stays stable (although it\u2019s worth mentioning more competitive fees should grow the pie), total fees paid will go down (volume would have to 5X for fees paid to LPs to stay the same). However, LPs are not the only constituency to take into consideration\u2013takers will be paying lower fees in aggregate. Growing Uniswap\u2019s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. These pools could become more enticing to large traders looking to swap stablecoins, for instance.  Concluding Thoughts We believe this simple change could boost Uniswap\u2019s competitiveness in low volatility pairs, and the change presents minimal risk for Uniswap.  Testing: Github  Using Hardhat, I forked the chain, implemented the proposal, and verified that it resulted in the expected result. ",
