                    "content": "The maker protocol has grown significantly and is securing more assets than ever, as well as more battle tested than ever. The emergency shutdown feature has always been a critical part of the design of Maker, as it makes it possible to reduce the severity of many types of critical issues (such as governance attacks) to simply the shutdown of the protocol, rather than e.g. stealing all the collateral. However, we are reaching a point where the core Maker security is so battle tested that the emergency shutdown feature is beginning to become a risk rather than a solution, as it increasingly looks like the most likely place for someone to try to damage the system, with only 75000 MKR currently needed to trigger ES. This is honestly making me quite nervous at this stage, and I dont think we should wait with fixing the vulnerability. I propose we double this to 150000 MKR to make the risk of a sudden ES significantly lower and the system as a whole safer and more reliable. To balance this change and mitigate the possibility that it might make a governance attack more attractive, I propose we also double the Governance Delay from the current 48 hours, to 96 hours (4 days). This way it will provide enough time to gather together enough MKR to react to a governance attack - obviously its not really possible to quantify this, but I think doubling both parameters is the simplest option that feels right.     Yes, increase the ESM threshold to 150000 MKR and the GSM delay to 96 hours No, keep it as it is Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps (added by LFW) This poll will end on Thursday 21st October, and will proceed to an on-chain poll the following Monday if it ends successfully.

All the pregenerated dai would then be sent to the ES claim contract, so lets say if maker is backed 50% by ETH and 50% by RWA, then in ES you would get 0.5 new dai (backed by RWA) and 0.5 USD worth of ETH.

                    "content": "Personally, I think a longer GSM delay makes sense at this point, even without modifying the ESM threshold. Responding to a sudden issue like Black Thursday or a vulnerability in another protocol needs to be done in much less time than 48 hours to achieve meaningful results, and is why we build instant access modules for risks we\u2019re really worried about (e.g. oracle attacks). OTOH it makes a big difference having 4 days instead of 2 to mobilize MKR holders to drop a malicious spell. 4 days is also still less than the time lag between sufficient bad debt accruing and flops starting, which is currently 6.5 days, so we\u2019d have about 2.5 days to react and postpone flops if for any reason that were necessary. The part I\u2019m not sure about is the 150K MKR limit on the ESM. For comparison, there\u2019s only about 150K MKR in the Chief currently, about ~75K of which is delegated. I worry that a 150K threshold is already enough to functionally disable the ESM, given how slow-moving large MKR whales tend to be. I\u2019d prefer a more conservative increase, e.g. to 100K or roughly 10% of supply. Maybe around 110K at most, which I think is roughly the heaviest weight that\u2019s ever been on a single spell at a given time. ",

Re: ESM itself, I feel uncomfortable with the actual ability for us to shut down. As DAI grows, we have to think not just about Maker or even vault holders, but systemic risk. There are increasing amounts of prices and debt obligations denominated in DAI, so it\u2019s not as simple as just DAI holders, either. We should probably come up with some kind of new plan that can minimize possible disruption to financial markets. Making ESM more difficult to activate as we figure that out feels correct to me. ",

The current 2 days is already making the Maker governance some inefficiency, that any executive proposal passed needed to wait for 2 days to be in effect. 2 days can be long in the crypto timeline, where projects (e.g., Liquity) are using codes and algorithms to make things faster and efficient, while we are looking to further increase the GSM delay? I think we should focus on making things more efficient instead of increase further the GSM delay, perhaps consider some kind of automated algorithms to replace governance for some simple functions as the start? For example, if ES of 2 day is not sufficient, we can have an algorithm that once this specific module is triggered, it takes 4 days to be in effect, and the delay does not affect other executive proposals.

An example, exec is posted on Friday, doesn\u2019t pass until Tuesday evening, GSM pause delay will expire on Saturday and office hours will delay things until the following Monday. This is 10 days after the executive was initially posted. This risk is probably higher now we have lost Planet\u2019s voting power. Is this an acceptable delay? Perhaps. More realistically if we are enacting this then we may want to move away from putting up execs on the Friday. Would be interested to hear thoughts on @prose11 and @LongForWisdom on this. ",

                    "content": "Definitely an important consideration. Basically the delay balances the time needed to detect an error/attack with the need to be nimble in the face of changing market conditions or undiscovered errors from previous proposals. Doing the executives on a different day is something we can look into, especially if the delay becomes a concern. There are a few nice things about dining it on Friday however:  gives teams time to coordinate throughout the week allows for discussions from the G&R to be considered in upcoming executive prevents the need for weekend coordination outside of urgent/emergency situations  Basically it\u2019s all a balancing act, but reworking our cadence is worth discussing if we do mess with some of the delay parameters.

                    "content": "Ok.   My take because I have been flagging ES as a possible attack vector for a while. Really would like to hear from PECO on this. My take.    Right now Maker has not even done a ES test.   My understanding is MKR has to pull from governance to enter the ES contract.   Without one single test on whether a ES could even be activated in a reasonable time (or what threshold is suitable) a number is just picked out of the air without data. As to the GSM delay.    Completely against 4 days because again without any data or sort of test we can\u2019t even assess what is a decent delay or under what conditions we already have the required control. What I really want to see here is a real Risk assessment (thank you @Primoz for commenting) and @Derek PECO to comment as well.   I believe we need to run two different test scenarios at least once and probably a couple times before we can properly assess what these settings should be based on MKR participating in governance.  govAlpha ES test dry run.   A quick and easy way govAlpha to throw up a ES test for MKR inside and outside governance to signal it would be ready to accomplish the on-chain tasks with another on-chain signal) but to \u2018not do them in actuality\u2019. Emergency executive dry run test.   Same deal - govAlpha throws up a emergency executive test and put up a on-chain response for MKR in governance to signal.  Ideally would like to run these kinds of tests on a cheaper chain or via a model where key signers can just sign when they would be ready to act. Measure response time and use this data to determine the proper ES and GSM delay settings. FYI:   Without above data I sit with @Primoz with general impression here.     Primoz:  but my preference is to have ESM threshold be a bit lower than the 150k proposed and GSM delay kept the same at 2 days. There was a good discussion on why a 4 day GSM delay may not have a significantly different outcome compared to 2 days when responding to potential bugs in most hypothetical cases, but I think the 4 day period is more problematic when it comes to changing system parameters for operational purposes, especially during volatile and unpredicted systemic events after this bull run. For instance if we needed to change auction parameters or lower debt ceilings (see Monetsupply\u2019s post  on DC-IAM gap/ttl parameters).   Because of the lack of data and even a lack of coherent response from CUs and the DAO here I am a no.  Not because I don\u2019t want to change this or see issues, but because the proposed changes are arbitrary and somewhat extreme and may have unintended consequences. I really want to urge GovAlpha to come up with the proposed tests and to collect data on MKR/governance response times so we can properly tune these.    We also need to make these tests part of the system operational readiness review process. ",
