No Project description:Pink Paper is a decentralized and permissionless publishing platform for individuals and communities worldwide to express their opinions and share the information with the rest of their communities. Users can come and publish blogs and other forms of content on the platform and showcase it to the world. At the same time, one can raise funds for their endeavors on the platform allowing donating to world-changing technologies. Pink Paper will provide a decentralized and censorship-free platform for everyone to use and express their views about different topics. Project links:  Website: https://pinkpaper.xyz/  Twitter:@Pinkpaperxyz  Please include all other relevant links below: GitHub - pinkpaper/pink-paper-frontend: This repo contains the open source frontend for PinkPaper.xyz   Additional team member info**: Rupin Mathur(Founder) He has been a Blockchain Maximalist since 2015 and an advocate of decentralization and self-sovereignty. He worked as marketing head for QuadB apparels from 2015-2017, India\u2019s second-largest custom apparel brand where he established the first VAL (Virtual Assembly Line) basically creating hundreds of nodal points for blue-collar workers scaling the business infinitely. From 2017 onwards, he decided to go all-in Web3 and thus acted a crucial part in setting up Finstreet, India\u2019s 1st Crypto Education Platform and scaled it to a community of 70,000+ Web3 Enthusiasts and 4.2 million social media following. During this journey, he worked alongside brands such as Near, Algorand, WazirX, Huobi, Polygon, Aave, and many more to help bring their respective platforms adoption in the Indian Markets, He has begun his journey to create and bring adoption for the Decentralized content management platform, Pink Paper LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupin-mathur-3a7689141/ Relevant usage metrics : NA Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://mirror.xyz/ Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Within two months after the grant approval Ecosystem Value Proposition:  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?  There are increased attacks from big tech worldwide on free speech. Big Tech platforms are increasingly banning specific individuals and communities from their platforms. In these testing times for free speech, Pink Paper aspires to protect the ethos of free speech and freedom for communities who want to raise their voice. Even Stani, founder of Aave was recently banned from Twitter for posting a joke which highlights the need for a decentralized platform.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?  We will provide a free platform which will be available with zero censorship and there\u2019s increasing need for such a platform where users data is being used to profit billions and at the same time deplatform them anytime the big tech wants.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?  With increased censorship by big tech decentralized, censorship free platforms will be in high demand. We want to cater to this growing demand and it will directly push the growth for Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 25,000 How much will your project match in co-incentives? NA Proposal for token distribution:  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)  Majority of the funds will be used for the development of the platform. Adoption Strategy:  We will be partnering with DAOs and companies to bring their content system on Pink Paper. It will be used for providing key updates and announcements for their communities. We will be launching a creator fund to incentivize writers, which will be distributed according to the engagement brought through their communities. We will be Collaborating with renowned authors, and novelists, and publish their upcoming novels on the Pink Papers platform, (increasing visibility and engagement of the platform through their communities) We will be Collaborating with Researchers and publish their research papers on the platform ( this will give penetration into the community of learned individuals in various academic fields) We will be Collaborating with localized news agencies and publishers to have local, national and international news published on the platform.  Key Outcomes:  Adoption of the publishing platform by major individual contributors along with companies as it provides a fair and free platform to communicate with their communities. Due to the Global, transparent & decentralized nature of the publishing platform, we will be able to better deliver to the different communities and readers around the world. Pink Paper will provide the platform as a center for decentralized information flow. One stop medium of communication with the communities of any type, size etc.  Development Roadmap: First Phase: MVP A. Building MVP on Optimism with following features: a.

If I login with MetaMask will I be doing more than just using blockchain identity? I can see that you\u2019ve already got a feature for making donations to authors, will that be done across the Optimism network Will there be other features eventually like minting posts and articles as NFTs like on Mirror, or are you intending to keep it simple and more streamlined? I\u2019m also really interested in the point you made that:     PinkPaper:  where users data is being used to profit billions   The sale of users\u2019 social media data and it\u2019s subsequent analysis and weaponization by political manipulation companies (like Cambridge Analytica) is one of the issues I think is most important to understand and counter in today\u2019s world. It sounds like you think that your project might be able to avoid this data harvesting somehow, so I\u2019d be really interested if you could expand on that. ",

Apart from this we will be developing social profiling system into our product which will have numerous use cases like projects can directly airdrop to creators with most engagement, etc. . We will be partnering with projects with the creator\u2019s fund to fund the creators on the platform. At the moment we are not actively looking to integrate the NFT part but going forward we will discuss with all the ecosystem partners and include it as per the requirement of the community. We are not storing any personal data. Anybody can just simply use the platform with their web3 wallet. All the data will be stored on IPFS and related decentralized services. We envision the product not just for web3 people but general people because of the ease being provided by web3-based login systems. We will provide a censorship free platform which supports freedom of speech for everyone around the world. ",
