But we can imagine a store where it is not the prices that change, but the amount of money in the wallet. It is interesting to study a certain city as an economic model, where prices for any product or real estate do not change, but the number of coins of people and businesses changes. Prices for goods can be assigned and depend on the number of goods and mutual proportions, different living conditions. In this system, buyers can buy exactly as many goods as there is money for it. Such an NFT-based system could become a model for an alternative type of economic distribution. ",
