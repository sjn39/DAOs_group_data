For details on opting in, see Opting in to Sourcecred/Wth is SourceCred?. Announcements With the passing of the November Governance Cycle Bundle, the SourceCred Funding Declaration of Intent has been ratified  As detailed in the the SourceCred Pilot Extension post, the SourceCred trial will be extended for an additional six months, during which time details of a technical integration can be worked out. This will include experimenting with the algorithm to determine optimal parameters, creating a process whereby parameters can be determined and ratified by Maker Governance, creating a process whereby Cred scores can be calculated and communicated in a reliable and trust-minimized way, and building an integration that allows tokens to be distributed directly from the protocol.  WARNING:  Cred scores and payouts may see volatility in the coming months as we tweak the algorithm and payout parameters. We still have a lot of work to do before the system is optimized enough to \u201cossify\u201d , producing predictable payouts. In case you missed it, starting in December (next week), payouts are increasing from 2,500 DAI/week to 5,000 DAI/week  For more details and motivations behind the change, see Increasing SourceCred Payouts. Payouts This week $2,500 worth of DAI was distributed based on Cred scores. Navigate to the DAI Accounts tab  of the Maker instance to see your current DAI balance and total DAI earned. Cred Stats This week saw the amount of Cred generated (a proxy for work) continue its uptrend. This week\u2019s numbers were helped by a number of high-effort posts dropping, as detailed below in the Top Contributions section. New participants continue to trickle in, with two new contributors opting in this week. 51 contributors are now receiving payouts.  image796\u00d7561 36.4 KB  Top Contributions Below are the top 10 posts created last week, ranked by Cred generated.
