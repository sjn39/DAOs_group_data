Along these lines I\u2019ve been looking at what we as PMs do, from the outside looking in.  How do developer-heavy crypto teams view us? What does an effective PM do?  I\u2019ve been thinking about the first question for a while now. I recently started shifting my focus to the second. Another way to ask the second question is - Pain and Symptoms \u201cWhat pain does an effective PM ease? What are the symptoms?\u201d Asking ourselves that question, from a team\u2019s perspective, will help project and product management gain traction in the space. Gaining traction will help more teams ship products. It\u2019s only once those product ship that they can contribute to decentralizing our world. Here are a few initial symptoms that came to my mind - 1 - A team can\u2019t get an idea past releasing a white paper, i.e. they don\u2019t know how to get started or where to start. 2 - A team did start and is active, as verified by them through their Github repo activity. Yet they feel they should be further along a/k/a aren\u2019t moving fast enough. 3 - A team is very close to releasing, yet can\u2019t get the project across the release line. 4 - A team\u2019s community is getting restless and antsy, starting to ask roadmap and timeline questions. 5 - A team has launched, yet very few people are using their product. Raising Awareness These symptoms aren\u2019t unique to crypto. I mention them to raise awareness of the symptoms. This awareness is important, since many #BUIDL\u2019ers may be working on their first project. As a result, they may not recognize the symptoms as they\u2019re experiencing them. What other symptoms do teams that need a PM experience? Let\u2019s discuss in the comments. (I first published this in the Blockchain PM newsletter.) ",

Are the above signs you mentioned generally accepted signs that a team is struggling with a lack of PM based structure ?  If so, then how can teams help themselves be more accountable, more vigilant to the signs and start addressing those issues earlier.  If not, then what are they or what are some we\u2019re not seeing here ?  My thought would be how do we formulate some type of Web3 team self analysis ? For me personally Iv\u2019e seen some of the above  effect various projects that iv\u2019e been connected to directly or indirectly. Here are some of my own:  Lack of communication between decision makers and lower level team members. Teams might know how they get from A - B - C but lack the clarity of how they get to Z. Following leaders blindly, because they \u201cknow\u201d better.  Leaders of a team whether from technical expertise or vision should be able to make a clear distinction for team members of how and why things are being done a certain way, \" because I said so\" simply doesn\u2019t cut it. Decision making centralized to a few people within the team.  ",

When a team is uncomfortable and unsure about its future direction, vision and roadmap ~ it\u2019s down on paper but you feel like there still are unspoken reservations When you feel it is hard to keep on top of what is going on with the team, what discussions are happening and overall feel like it is hard to \u2018keep on top of it all\u2019 When the work being done feels inconsiderate and often unvervalued if not ignored Other feelings of struggling to trying to keep up  ",
