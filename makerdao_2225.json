This DAO Resolution instructs the directors of the RWA Foundation to take several actions to support the Foundation\u2019s work. The directors are instructed to onboard with a new prime broker, engage legal and accounting firms as needed, and expense no more than $25,000 per year in fees for services provided by these firms to the RWA Master Participation Trust.

It will be important, however, to have the new broker accept the inflexible structure implemented in the existing arrangement. I recommend that Ankura Trust be fully informed of any developments as they have responsibility to monitor the RWA Foundation account. The engagement of an accounting firm is important for general compliance. In the interest of full disclosure, neither I nor North Lakes Legal will benefit from the passage of this MIP. I am simply pleased to see RWA Foundation continue to evolve. ",

SF just happened to have looked at the things that need to be done there while monitoring RWA.     Doo_StableLab:  And is this asking for separate budget?   Yes and no, the expenses we are talking would be taken from the HVB deal, just like Ankura, WSFS and the other service providers for RWA Foundation. Or, in MIP65, like service providers of James Asset PTC. The RWA Foundation was setup to have little power and autonomy in order to protect Maker as much as possible. But the counterparty is that Maker should watch over the RWA Foundation. If we don\u2019t onboard a new broker, you are betting on Genesis Trading only. If you don\u2019t onboard Ogier, directors might not execute follow up resolution as they can\u2019t be advise on the legality of it. If you don\u2019t onboard an accounting firm, the RWA Foundation will at some point not be in good standing. Decision is up to MKR tokenholders. I would have less to do if you vote it down, but it is my duty to advise to vote it. There is exactly no reason to vote it down. In the endgame, probably better to use arrangers to take care of those administrative problems. But so far no one wanted to deal with it. It will probably be more expenses. PS: We also need to check TACO (the Foundation used for Blocktower MIP6). ",
