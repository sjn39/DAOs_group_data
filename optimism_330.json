The workload for delegates was very intense and we appreciate your dedication, feedback, and willingness to iterate. In recognition of this work, the Foundation will retroactively reward the top active delegates from Seasons 1 & 2.  Delegates with >0.5% voting power are eligible to receive 10,500 OP, if they meet the below criteria. Delegates with >0.25% but <0.5% voting power are eligible to receive 8,000 OP, if they meet the below criteria. These criteria, while imperfect, attempt to take into account a delegate\u2019s reputation, voting participation, and voting quality. Please remember this criteria is only being used for Season 2 and is likely to change in the future Seasons as governance evolves.  Untitled1003\u00d7523 49.2 KB  note: snapshot as of 11/11/22 Qualifying delegates:  OPSNXambassadors.eth (problems voting are well documented, but some examples are here and here) lindajxie.eth polynya.eth Quix lefteris.eth katiegarcia.eth ceresstation.eth griff.eth gfxlabs.eth (problems voting documented here) flipsidecrypto.eth Sugma.eth solarcurve.eth UPennBlockchain.eth MinimalGravitas.eth joxes.defilatam.eth butterbum.eth dhannte.eth ScaleWeb3.eth/superdelegate.eth (address change documented here) hailvitalik.eth stablenodegov.eth  If you were prevented from fulfilling the voting participation criteria due to third-party application errors, please DM lavande#3900 with evidence of your participation (transaction hashes, etc.) by end of day Monday, November 21st If you met the quality approximation criteria but were not added to the list because forum name(s) do not clearly tie to your on-chain address, please DM lavande#3900 by end of day Monday, November 21st  In addition to the above rewards, 4,000 OP will be distributed to each member of Shadow Committee B, in recognition of their contributions during Season 2.  Untitled (1)1002\u00d7151 15 KB  Shadow Committee B members:  jackanorak.eth Mastermojo Matt L Sugma.eth solarcurve.eth  Consistent with other grant distributions, delegate rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.  In Season 3, rewards will be pre-defined for all Council positions, if the Grants Council is approved.  All other delegate rewards will continue to be allocated retroactively. As Collective governance processes are still highly experimental, there may be large shifts in delegate responsibility and activity levels between Seasons. Distributing rewards retroactively allows for flexibility in the face of this high variability. Once governance has stabilized, an ongoing delegate rewards policy may be implemented, subject to a governance vote. This round of retroactive delegate rewards will be allocated from the \u201cUnallocated\u201d portion of the Ecosystem Fund, not the Governance Fund (and is therefore not subject to Token House approval). Delegates are a critical part of Optimism governance. Without delegates, we cannot effectively translate individual needs and wants into Collective action. We know participating in Token House governance requires a serious time commitment and are beyond grateful for your engagement in governance, as it benefits the whole Collective. ",
