                    "content": "Sometimes it is unclear what the status is on certain collateral types, like which ones have passed, which ones are being implemented by the Foundation, and what\u2019s on deck. What if we could make a quick dashboard that is updated weekly to show the status of collateral, and also get a clearer indication of which of the \u2018passed\u2019 collateral types are currently being worked on, and what is next? We have a pretty decent backlog of collateral types, and I myself am curious when things like PC-DROP (passed a little while ago) will get worked on.  An idea is to put everything into a simple Trello board [attached][ or some other project management tool, to quickly visualize the collateral lifecycle of Maker.  This can give governance slightly better view into the Foundation\u2019s work, without being too overbearing.  Better yet, this could be a website where people can monitor vote status, access forum links, etc.  Is this desirable to people?  The downside is this just another artifact to maintain, so it should only be done if its useful.  How else are people currently keeping track today? col-status1442\u00d7680 89.1 KB ",
