It ensures your location stays private, your data remains encrypted, and you can surf the web more anonymously than without it. A commercial VPN provider knows exactly who you are and what you\u2019re doing. They can find out who you are from your IP address, payment information, emails, usernames, browsing history, etc. The VPN provider is in full position to log all of your traffic or launch man-in-the-middle attacks. Many commercial VPN providers promise to not keep any logs of your activities, but why trust them? This guide helps you set up a VPN without relying on a commercial provider. If you still can\u2019t be bothered to run your own, at least do your research on good VPN companies. My recommendation is Mullvad VPN. Obviously, pay with an anonymous payment method. But then again, IMO there are only two real options for privacy a self-hosted VPN or TOR. Further enhancement of your OpSec If you want to further enhance your OpSec, you can run Tails or Qubes as your OS and you TORify all your traffic (not only your browser) e.g. by using Whonix or Nipe. A VPN encrypts the traffic while TOR anonymizes it - these are two slightly different things. If you connect to TOR, your internet service provider can detect that you did that, but that is everything they will know, they will not know what sites you went to. Using a VPN in front of TOR means your internet service provider no longer knows you went to TOR. To read more about the combo, go here. While TOR and VPN services both work to keep your identity anonymous, the latter is a more convenient choice when used correctly, as TOR often is very slow and doesn\u2019t provide access to all websites. However, TOR grants a higher level of anonymity. Be aware, none of the tools provides you 100% security or privacy. 1-2-3-GO! The quick guide is for you who just want to rush through the three steps and hope nothing breaks.   Rent a VPS on Digital Ocean and pay with crypto from an undoxxed wallet through https://www.BitLaunch.io. I don\u2019t have to tell you to not sign in on BitLaunch using a Google login or a doxxed email and pay with crypto from an undoxxed wallet\u2026   Install this VPN on the VPS GitHub - trailofbits/algo: Set up a personal VPN in the cloud   Install the WireGuard VPN on your devices Installation - WireGuard   If the quick guide causes you trouble, or if you want more details about the setup, head to the step-by-step guide at the bottom of this post. Pros for hosting your own VPN   Prevent any public WiFi from snooping on your browsing activities or injecting adverts / tracking / malicious code into your web browser (including theft);   Break the link between the IP you use for your anon activities and name on your cell/Internet bill;   Allow you to hide your geographic location (or present a different location) when using online services;   Actually no logs (you are in control);   You are in control over the software (using WireGuard over OpenVPN, making sure the binaries are not tampered with).   Cons for hosting your own VPN   Can\u2019t easily distribute your VPN through multiple countries   Your VPS provider could still spy on your activity with a a \u2018Website Fingerprint Attack\u2019   Why all anons should use a VPN The motivations for becoming an anon can include avoiding envy, harassment, and becoming a target for crime. It seems to me that the interest in becoming an anon has increased over the last few years, or even months. If you want to keep your real-world identity separate from your online anon identity and crypto activity, you should probably use a VPN. ELI5 A VPN extends a private network across a public network using encryption software. Each computer has a unique IP address which tells the Internet Protocol where to send data addressed to that computer; These addresses usually correspond to a physical location or user identifier (a specific office or employee ID for companies or the bill payer for consumer Internet subscribers). A VPN can be used to encrypt the address (and physical location) of a computer and keep data flows between computers confidential. Why should I use a VPN? What is the Value of changing my IP address? Everything you do online ends up in log files stored by the service providers you use and the hosts of the sites you browse. Governments can request this information and use the listed IP addresses to track your identity and location. But with a VPN the information only reaches the VPN server. They cant track you back to your original IP address. Many commercial VPN providers promise to not keep any logs of your activities, but why trust them? Your IP address also traces closely to your location - to city neighborhood, town level. This data can be used by anyone like ad companies, search engines, etc. By using a VPN you can hide or change your geographic location and you can prevent different types of your online activity being linked to the same identity/profile. Why would this be a problem? If you are using the same IP for your real-world identity (for instance by using your private Twitter or Facebook account) and you also contribute as an anon, this makes you traceable. Your anon profile can be matched to your Facebook profile and you risk being doxxed. I would like to know a bit more about the setup before I proceed to the guide When to use this VPN You are using this VPN for services where you need to \u2018log in\u2019 and are therefore not anonymous (though you may be using a pseudonym). If you use a separate computer and phone for your work activities, you can stay connected to the VPN as long as you never uses those devices for purposes that can be associated with your real identity. Virtual Private Server You need a VPS to host your own VPN. Most VPS can be set up to work as a VPN endpoint, so you simply bypass many issues with commercial VPNs by renting a virtual server from a reputable provider like Digital Ocean or Linode. I don\u2019t recommend linking your VPS to your personal name by paying in fiat or registering with your private email address. You can pay anonymously with crypto at BitLaunch.io and they\u2019ll give you access to a VPS at Linode or Digital Ocean, both are considered solid providers. Free and Open-Source Software VPN software from a commercial provider could be malicious. Use either the VPN tools built into the operating system (Apple) or a free software project like Wireguard because it has had many security experts review its code (and works on all platforms Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iPhone/iOS). Use Trail of Bits deployment script for a VPS hosted VPN called Algo I recommend using Algo by Trail of Bits (Source). They have a presence in the crypto community as the auditor of Gemini and other DeFi projects. The step-by-step-guide As you saw in the quick guide, you rent a VPS, install the VPN on the VPS, then install the Wireguard VPN software on each of your devices. You connect to the VPN when you are operating as anon and disconnect when you are going to log into a service (e.g. Facebook) with your government name. Even better, use one device for personal use and another device for anon/crypto use, the device you use for anon-activities stays connected to the VPN and never visits any services that are connected to your real-world identity.   Register a new account on BitLaunch.io   Log in to BitLaunch and ask support chat for a $0.10 credit \u2018to check that Trail of Bits\u2019 Algo VPN works with my connection. This should be approved in less than 10 minutes. Or just make the payment upfront, and take the chance.   Visit BitLaunch to Create a New Server   Select Linode or Digital Ocean as a \u2018host\u2019 choose depending on which datacenter region you prefer, the options differ slightly. Browse all options before making your final choice Choose a datacenter region. This will be the location you appear to be from so choose according to your needs.   Choose an image: Ubuntu version 20.04 LTS   Choose a size: the smallest / cheapest \u2018Standard\u2019 plan will do just fine, it comes at $14/mo.   Set access your method. Use SSH keys if you know how, otherwise set a strong password. Pick something long and complex.  Finally, click Launch Server.  You should be redirected to a page that lists the IP address of your server something looking like this: 192.168.100.1. Instructions - Configure VPS for VPN You want to make sure your IP address connected to your government name is hidden for the next couple of steps. Use a public wifi, connect through a phone that runs on a burner sim, Whonix or another VPN. You will need to use a terminal to type in commands to the computer. Remember you have to press Enter after each command. If you are on MacOS: 8.1.1 (mac) Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, 8.1.2 (mac) type Terminal in the search field, 8.1.3 (mac) then click Terminal. Now go to SSH section (step 9) below. If you are on Windows: SSH is not included and the easiest way to install a terminal is to download \u2018Git\u2019 the popular version control software. 8.2.1 (Win) Visit https://gitforwindows.org/ , 8.2.2 (Win) Download, run the installer and follow the instructions. 8.2.3 (Win) Right click on your desktop and select the \u2018Git Bash Here\u2019 option to open a terminal. SSH  Enter the following command in the terminal window exactly as written, replacing 1.2.3.4 with the IP address of your VPS which you wrote down earlier.  ssh [email\u00a0protected]   Press Enter.  As you have never connected to this VPS, you will receive a message explaining the authenticity of the host is not established and asking if you want to connect anyway.   Type yes and press Enter.   Type in the long and complex password you chose earlier.   You should now be connected to your VPS. You will know you are connected because your terminal will display a line like this: [email\u00a0protected]:~$   copy and paste the following command exactly. If you do not do this correctly the process will not work. This updates your server and installs the official version of Algo by Trail Of Bits by pulling the script from their GitHub repository.  apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trailofbits/algo/master/install.sh   | bash -x -s local false false _null false false false $(curl -4 ifconfig.io) phone,tablet,laptop,pc,extradevice1,extradevice2   Press Enter.  You will know it is working because a large amount of text will scroll across your screen as the configuration runs. This takes a couple of minutes. When the process finishes the text will stop scrolling and you should see this text: CONGRATULATIONS YOUR ALGO SERVER IS RUNNING CONFIG FILES AND CERTIFICATES ARE IN THE CONFIGS DIRECTORY GO TO HTTPS://WHOER.NET AFTER CONNECTING AND ENSURE THAT ALL YOUR TRAFFIC PASSES THROUGH THE VPN. THE P12 AND SSH KEYS PASSWORD FOR NEW USERS IS [specific in your terminal] If you do not see this text, you will get an error message instead, and the process has not worked.   If you do see the \u2018congratulations\u2019 message, type exit   Press Enter.   Copy the configuration files from the VPS to your computer. Paste the following command in your terminal, replacing 1.2.3.4 with your VPS IP address which you wrote down earlier.   mkdir vpn-config && cd vpn-config && scp -r [email\u00a0protected]:/opt/algo/configs    Press Enter.   You will then need to type the long and complex password you chose earlier. And press Enter.   Some text will scroll, these are the names of the files being copied. When this process stops. You can close your terminal.   This will create a folder called vpn-config on your desktop (Windows) or your home folder (MacOS) where your VPN configuration files are stored. You will need to send a different one of these files to each additional device you add to your VPN. Device Set Up Android 21.1.1 (Android): Install the WireGuard VPN Client from Google Play 21.1.2: Open QR code image file configs/<ip_address>/wireguard/phone.png from the vpn-config folder you downloaded earlier on your computer. 21.1.3.: Open Wireguard app on Android, press the blue button in the bottom right, select the QR code option, and point your camera at the QR code displayed on your computer to scan it in the WireGuard app. Give the connection a name and then use the slider to enable the connection. iPhone 21.2.1 (Iphone) Open *.mobileconfig file (AirDrop or email) 21.2.2 (Iphone) Settings | Profile | Install Algo VPN (accept warning) 21.2.3 (Iphone) Settings | VPN | Connect slider Alternative: if this does not connect (status stays as Connecting),  your ISP may be blocking the IKEv2 IPSEC VPN ports. Try installing Wireguard from the App store and send the configs/<ip_address>/wireguard/<device.conf> file to the iPhone. This uses a different port and may get around an ISP block. MacOS For modern version of MacOS you can use the built in IPSEC VPN. 21.3.1 (Mac) Find the mobileconfig (Apple Profile) from the vpn-config folder you downloaded into your home directory. Apple Configuration Profiles are all-in-one configuration files for iOS and macOS devices. 21.3.2 (Mac) double-clicking a profile to install it will fully configure the VPN. On iOS, users are prompted to install the profile as soon as the AirDrop is accepted. 21.3.3 (Mac) Connect to the VPN by opening System Preferences \u2192 Network, finding the Algo VPN in the left column, and clicking Connect. Check Show VPN status in menu bar to easily connect and disconnect from the menu bar. If you use one device for both anon and private activities I do not recommend using \u2018Connect On Demand\u2019 as you will want to control when you enable the VPN rather than have this be automatic. If you use separate devices for anon activities and private activities I do recommend using \u2018Connect On Demand\u2019 as you will want the VPN connection to happen automatically. In this case I also recommend applying a kill switch so you can only connect to the internet, when the VPN is active. Alternative: if this does not connect your ISP may be blocking the IKEv2 IPSEC VPN ports. Install Wireguard from the App store and use the configs/<ip_address>/wireguard/<device.conf> file to configure. This uses a different port and may get around an ISP block. Windows 21.4.1 (Win) Install WireGuard from Installation - WireGuard 21.4.2 (Win) Run the installer (as Administrator or a user with Administrator level access) 21.4.3 (Win) Run the app and click the Import tunnel(s) from file button. 21.4.4 (Win) Browse to configs/<ip_address>/wireguard/ from the vpn-config folder you downloaded earlier and select a file e.g. laptop.conf. (note that you can only use 1 configuration file per device). 21.4.5 (Win) Click Open, then Activate to connect to the VPN. You can also turn on Block untunneled traffic (kill switch) if desired. Linux Qubes - Fedora VM 21.5.1 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Create a new qube Click on the Qubes app menu and then Create Qubes VM.   Name and label: AlgoVPN.   Type: Qube based on a template (AppVM).   Template: fedora-36 (or later).   Networking: default (sys-firewall).   Advanced: Check (enable) provides network.   Click on OK.   21.5.2 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Place the WireGuard configuration file Copy the files from step 20 to the home directory in the AlgoVPN VM. 21.5.3 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Install WireGuard We will install WireGuard in the Fedora-36 template so your AlgoVPN ProxyVM can use that.   Click on the Qubes app menu and go to Template: fedora-36 and open the Terminal.   In the Terminal run the command   sudo dnf install wireguard-tools -y   Shut down the VM with the command  sudo shutdown -h now  If you are not able to run these commands, go to the network settings of the template to make sure it has access to the internet. Remember to deactivate the internet connection to this template once you are done installing the VPN. 21.5.4 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Set the Networking   Click on the Qubes app menu and go to System Tools > Qube Manager.   Select the AppVM that you want to use with the AlgoVPN ProxyVM and click on the Stop button in the toolbar to shut it down.   Right click on the same AppVM and then select Qube settings.   On the Basic tab, click on the Networking drop-down list and select AlgoVPN.   Click on OK.   Click on the Start button in the toolbar to start the AppVM again.   21.5.5 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Configure WireGuard In the AlgoVPN ProxyVM:   Click on the Qubes app menu and go to AlgoVPN and open the Terminal.   Now you will copy the WireGuard .conf file that was copied from the other AppVM to the /home/user/ folder so it persists after reboot. First run:   cd /home/user/QubesIncoming/*   Then run:  cp mlvd*.conf /home/user    Now you will edit the /rw/config/rc.local file using a text editor. First, install nano:  sudo dnf install nano -y    Then run  sudo nano /rw/config/rc.local    Add  wg-quick up /home/user/mlvd-se9.conf  (or the config file you used) on a new line.  Press Ctrl+O (Enter) and then Ctrl+X to save and exit.  Make sure that WireGuard connects:  Open your browser and visit www.dnsleaktest.com   21.5.6 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Add DNS hijacking rules Now we will add firewall rules to redirect DNS requests to 10.64.0.1 (the DNS on the VPN server) for all AppVMs that use the AlgoVPN ProxyVM. Make sure that you have started an AppVM that has the Networking set to AlgoVPN, otherwise the \u201cvif\u201d IP address will not be visible. Still in the AlgoVPN Terminal:  To find out your vif* IP address, run  ip a | grep -i vif   Edit the firewall user file with nano:  sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script    Copy and paste the following in the bottom. Replace 10.137.0.47 with your own vif* IP address:   # replace 10.137.0.47 with the IP address of your vif* interface virtualif=10.137.0.47 vpndns1=10.64.0.1 iptables -F OUTPUT iptables -I FORWARD -o eth0 -j DROP iptables -I FORWARD -i eth0 -j DROP iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS  --clamp-mss-to-pmtu iptables -F PR-QBS -t nat iptables -A PR-QBS -t nat -d $virtualif -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $vpndns1 iptables -A PR-QBS -t nat -d $virtualif -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $vpndns1   Press Ctrl+O (Enter) and then Ctrl+X to save and exit.  21.5.7 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Add qube firewall rules In Qube Manager, select AlgoVPN then right-click and select Qube settings. Make the following changes:   Ensure it is still set to use sys-firewall as \u201cNetworking\u201d.   Check \u201cStart qube automatically on boot\u201d.   Click on the \u201cFirewall rules\u201d tab.   Click on \u201cLimit outgoing internet connections to \u2026\u201d.   Click on \u201c+\u201d and enter the IP addresses of the VPN servers that you want to be able to connect to. You can find it in the WireGuard configuration file (mlvd-se9.conf) on the Endpoint line, or in our Servers list.   Click on OK.   In the next step you will edit the firewall manually. After this you can not open Qube Manager and add rules on the Firewall rules tab anymore, so make sure to add all the servers you need now. If you have to add more servers later you can do it in the Terminal Emulator using the following command (replace SERVER-IP with the IP-address to the Algo VPN server). qvm-firewall AlgoVPN add accept dsthost=SERVER-IP  21.5.8 (Linux Qubes - Fedora VM) Disable ping replies   Click on the Qubes app menu and open Terminal Emulator.   Run   qvm-firewall AlgoVPN list  Find the rule in the bottom that says \u201caccept icmp\u201d and note the line number.  Run  qvm-firewall AlgoVPN del --rule-no NUMBER  Replace NUMBER with the line number you found above.  Run  qvm-firewall AlgoVPN add --before NUMBER drop proto=icmp  Replace NUMBER with the line number you found above. This new rule will be added before the last \u201cdrop\u201d line.  Check it by running the list command again. The rules should be in this order: accept (the IP addresses of the VPN servers), accept dns, drop icmp, drop.  21.6.1 For other Linux guides see  algo   Using Ubuntu as a Client with WireGuard Set up a personal VPN in the cloud        algo   Linux strongSwan IPsec Clients (e.g., OpenWRT, Ubuntu Server, etc.) Set up a personal VPN in the cloud        algo   Linux client setup Set up a personal VPN in the cloud      Important final step  On each device, please visit https://whoer.net/  after turning on the VPN to check that your IP / location has changed.  You should see the location which you selected in the data centre region you chose earlier. If you didn\u2019t already do it, you must now add funds to your BitLaunch account, and generate and pay the crypto invoice (in BTC ETH, or LTC). Remember to do this from an undoxxed wallet. Remember: do not make any connections from the VPN to your real-world identity by signing in with your government name to any web service while connected to the VPN. ",
