If it traded above, you could arbitrage the difference risklessly by minting stETH with 1 ETH and selling 1 stETH immediately for more than 1 ETH. Below 1 ETH there is no arbitrage price because it is impossible to redeem 1 stETH for 1 ETH. Therefore, stETH more closely represents a PIK coupon bond with an unknown maturity date. It can, should and does trade freely. When redemptions become possible you could expect it to trade close to 1 ETH give or take transaction friction. As to whether Maker should step in to save market participants from overlevering on the mistaken assumption that 1 stETH should equal 1 ETH, I put this in the same category as the question of whether Maker should finance Ukrainian War Bonds: No. ",

                    "content": "Hey, just want to add how we see the proposal and risks associated with it. If we consider wstETH equal to ETH internally, we are completely exposed to Lido risk. Also assuming the proposed strategy, we would need to further increase DC of wstETH vaults and probably lower CR (Aave has lower CR than us, so some of their positions couldn\u2019t be migrated to us). If something were to happen with Lido, we would become exit liquidity for the whole ecosystem. I would also not recommend substantially increasing the collateral structure towards an illiquid asset. If someone were to trigger ES, dai holders would carry depeg loss or would be stuck with it for some time. There is also a problem with general price drops in ETH, even if there are no problems with stETH/ETH peg. With diminished liquidity, some users won\u2019t be able to unwind their stETH position. So even if we offer protection against depeg to users, we will still assume large ETH market risk and potential wstETH bad debt due to large price slippage. I think we should distance ourselves from systemic risk currently present among large crypto entities. wstETH is different from WBTC and USDC where we assume 1:1. wstETH is much more technically complex, merge and withdrawal capability can be further delayed and there are generally more potential issues with it. WBTC and USDC are essentially just tokenized assets and some central entity is holding reserves. Out of context of this poll, but here is a comment in regards to our current direct exposure to wstETH; About 76.5% of wstETH debt in Maker is from Gnosis Treasury and 7 siblings. Both users have some additional capital to top up/repay and are generally active in vault management. So we are more exposed to general ETH market risk than stETH-ETH depeg risk. When we proposed CR for wstETH-A we already accounted for potential depeg (ETH-A is 145%, wstETH-A is at 160%). We believe there is hidden demand and the derivative will not depeg substantially (10%+). ",
