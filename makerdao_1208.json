The focus will be on getting short term governance under control, including reviewing focus objectives, rebalancing votes to delegates, discussing checks and balances on delegates, and empowering supporting core units and talk about principles of how we MKR holders should influence the development DAO Toolkit that\u2019s being developed by SES to make sure that it delivers what we want to see in Decentralized Voter Committees. Thursday 5pm CEST I will do a presentation on the Endgame Plan, including a new section on the Endgame Decentralized Workforce that has not yet been widely published, and only been shared on discord so far. It will continue the discussion of how to position MKR voters to provide the strongest check and balancing force on the decentralized workforce to ensure that everyone is aligned and set up for success. I will be requesting support from GovComms for hosting and recording these meetings, as the last times, to ensure maximum transparency for the whole community. Call Join Link - Wednesday Call Join Link - Thursday ",

In particular I want to impact what\u2019s happening with RWA sooner rather than later, and do it by setting up a specialized voter committee with focus on RWAs in the short run. I will also be rebalancing delegate votes. I chose not to do it after the last DVC in the end, because there had been some confusion about the timing, but this time my goal is to begin to take action for real so there will be no more grace period when it comes to my delegation. If you are a delegate that wants to be considered for delegation you have to join the voter committees, and participate. ",

I would much appreciate it if other MKR holders would join and share their voting capability in advance. This helps create more stability around the voter committees and maker governance in general, and it will give you a much greater influence over my own voter behaviour, as my main objective is to try to align with other MKR holders and create a coalition that aim to improve Maker, deal with the complexity and bad habits and accept the burden that we have to be the ones to make some tough decisions.
