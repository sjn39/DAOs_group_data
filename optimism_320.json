For the first time I just wanted to delegate my voting power and thus I\u2019ve read through the different Delegates and their proposals. It then came to my mind that I want to support different delegates, since I support more than just one delegate and their visions, however it is not possible. In order to do so I have to use different addresses which is quite a hassle to be honest. Now, that\u2019s why I come here to propose this option. Is this possible to add this feature in the future? PS: Just to be clear what I mean here is an example: Lets assume I have 10k OP to delegate and I like  the proposals and visions of Delegate A and Delegate B and thus want to support them each with 50% (5k) of my voting power instead of giving it to just one.
