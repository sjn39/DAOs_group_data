JustinCase - YouTube Resides in the UTC+1 time zone. Core Values Maintaining obligations \u2013 Trust comes from honouring commitments; trust is essential for adoption and use of the protocol. Growing the profitability of the protocol \u2013 Growth is good, but growth must lead to profitability. I favour increasing revenue over reducing costs. Simplicity \u2013 given a choice between a complex and a less complex solution I will favour the less complex one. Delegate Statement Summary: I will work towards:  Ensuring that a portion of the protocol profits are going towards maintaining a steady burn but recognize that the protocol has other strategic goals as well. Making sure that previously made deals are honoured and that changes, and terminations of deals are communicated well in advance. Enhancing growth of the protocol and adoption in new areas, while growing revenue and profitability. Communicating in a more easily understandable fashion and to try to create enthusiasm for governance among smaller holders of MKR.  Here are examples of me advocating some of these issues, A B C When I first got into Maker in the fall of 2018 the way it was presented to me was something like this: \u201cThis new protocol generates a stablecoin that it lends out and it uses the profits to burn the token and increase its value\u201d. With a lifelong interest in finance and just dipping my toes into crypto, this was a sentence that resonated with me. It presented something different in the cryptosphere. I believe many others have heard a similar pitch and has for a time been somewhat disappointed that a combination of factors has led to long periods of no burn. As examples I have these two quotes from two different articles about Maker: \u201c\u2026All accrued fees on MakerDAO are paid in MKR. The protocol purchases MKR off the secondary market and burns it, ensuring proper alignment incentive between MKR token holders. The burning of MKR reduces its supply in circulation through its intentional destruction. It is an effective method for increasing and stabilizing the price of MKR with the increased value given to the holder resembling that of a dividend\u2026\u201d Link \u201c\u2026Token Burn \u201cBurnt tokens\u201d have effectively been destroyed, ultimately reducing the total supply of tokens in circulation. Interest accumulated on Maker vaults is paid back in Dai, this Dai is then automatically swapped for MKR and burned. This is the primary economic driver behind the price of MKR tokens. Burning MKR reduces the supply of tokens, putting constant upwards pressure on the price. The more Dai in circulation, the more interest is generated, the stronger the upwards pressure on MKR\u2019s price \u2026\u201d Link This shows that the perception from the outside is that MKR tokens will be burned. Failing to live up to this expectation is to me a failure to meet obligations. I believe that prolonged periods with no burn is damaging to MakerDAO\u2019s credibility and trust and has caused some retail investors to look to other projects, reducing value for remaining MKR holders. In order to maintain a healthy burn we must turn a healthy profit as well as keep the protocol safe and stable. As indicated by the portion of MKR in my portfolio I am a believer in the growth potential of Maker. I think there is a potential for capturing a larger market share in the cryptosphere, but I believe there is an even larger potential for growth in Real World Assets (RWA). Maintaining a burn touches into a broader issue of meeting obligations in general. As we grow larger in RWA, we\u2019re going to have many entities depending on MakerDAO acting in good faith and honouring its obligations. Erratic behaviour will result in us losing trust with other entities and reducing our potential as a partner. My default stance will always be to maintain previous deals, either implicit or explicit. Strong arguments can sway a particular issue or stance but if we need to break off on a previous agreement it will have to be after giving a fair warning ahead of time that we intend to do so, assuming it is not possible to come to a mutually agreeable alternate plan. I recognize that Maker can have a very high barrier of entry and I will do my very best to try to keep my communication as understandable as possible with as little technical jargon and abbreviations as possible. Lastly, I\u2019d like to share a little of my background. I\u2019m currently working in business administration with a decade of experience. I hold an MBA with a major in Strategy and a minor in Finance. I have also had some experience from politics. The key takeaway for me was to more carefully consider the needs of different parties and come up with a workable solution that leaves stakeholders satisfied. Potential conflicts of interest I am a holder of MKR and currently it is about half my crypto portfolio. The maker portion is about two years salary. The other half is in ETH. I hold a diversified portfolio of stocks and funds. My primary income is not from Maker, nor do I receive any form of compensation outside of MakerDAO for my participation within. Waiver of liability I have read and pledge to follow the Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct. As such I will to the best of my ability act in good faith to the best interests of the Maker Protocol. I will maintain communication regarding my stance on the various issues that is voted on. By delegating to me you acknowledge and agree that JustinCase will not be held liable for any damages caused by my participation in the Maker Protocol or because of any votes cast while acting as a delegate.

Rates Proposal - November 15, 2021 Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal is in essence a question of balancing risk with growth. The carrot is that reducing risk comes with some extra revenue. Offboard the AAVE-A Vault Type - November 15, 2021 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Conflicted between profitability and maintaining obligations I landed on the side of profitability. Due to the lack of an entity to communicate with one must assume that stakeholders in this case are \u201ccommunicating with their assets\u201d and the lack of profitable interest is an indication this collateral type is not needed right now.

Change of Covenants for P1-DROP (Peoples Company Series 1) - November 15, 2021 Voted: Yes Reasoning: I can see the concerns regarding the legal structures and the murkiness regarding the risk. However in this case it is not enough for me to overcome my default stance of maintaining obligations. If we want to unwind from the current structure I think we should start a process on that and signal our intentions well in advance. Preferably we should work out a new structure that doesn\u2019t leave our counterparts hanging. ",

Voted: Yes Reasoning: The poll that ended November 15. covers almost all of this executive and I voted yes in the relevant polls. The piece included is adding the WBTC-B vault type. This is a riskier type of vault but has a higher stability fee. It mirrors the existing ETH-B vaults. The likely results of introducing this vault is that some portion of WBTC will flow to this new type of vault. Overall it might increase risk somewhat but it is bundled with a change that will reduce risk in the same vault type. I approve of this change. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending November 22, 2021 Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: This is a very interesting proposal introducing a possibility for getting fixed interests in vaults. With this proposal I see some of my principles being in opposition. On the pro side we\u2019re looking at a growth opportunity in capturing value from actors that require fixed rates, we\u2019re getting more predictable income which can serve as insurance for when markets turn, and we open up the potential to other applications being built onto this. On the con side I see this adding more complexity, both on the technical side and for users to relate to. There has also been raised some concerns on the legal side which hasn\u2019t been fully answered. Overall I\u2019m torn enough that I vote abstain. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP39) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I believe Makers greatest growth potential lies within Real World Finance. The team so far has done great work and I have full confidence they will put the funds to good use. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40) Voted: Yes Resoning: Hardly controversial this makes some minor changes to the budget, but most importantly extends until then end of the second quarter of 2022. Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Voted: Yes Reasoning: If we are to maintain our obligations we need to ensure the security and integrity of the protocol. Leaving that to chance seems ill advised. Ratification Poll for Adding Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit, SAS-001 Voted: Yes Reasoning: One of our key obligation is making sure the protocol stays collateralized. In order to do so we need to make sure the liquidation auctions are working as intended. This seems to me to be a step in the right direction to make sure we live up to our obligations. Ratification Poll for Real-World Finance Core Unit MKR Compensation, RWF-001 Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal establishes MKR compensation for the Real World Asset core unit. Having compensation in MKR increases the teams alignment with that of other MKR holders. I believe this is a prudent step and in line with what is done in other core units. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal extends the budget of Content Production until the end of the first half of 2022. Having core units comes with the obligation to fund them so this is an easy yes. Ratification Poll for Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal adds a list of further requirements to any onboarding applications for real world assets. As we cross the boundaries from the virtual to the physical there are information needs that needs to be filled. This proposal helps fill that need for information, and is something we should expect anyone wishing to onboard real world collateral to answer. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending November 25. 2021 Add WBTC-C as a new Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is the complementary vault type to WBTC-B that I discussed in relation to the executive of November 19. WBTC is a less risky vault than WBTC-A and given the volume in those vaults I think it is worth it to provide a less risky alternative. This also helps balance out the increased risks that comes from the WBTC-B vaults. The downside is less revenue generated. Increase the System Surplus Buffer Voted: 1. No increase 2. Increse Stability buffer to 90M and the limit by 0.67M/week 3. Increase Stability buffer to 90M and the limit by 1M/Week Reasoning: This is an issue I feel strongly about and one that is at the center of my delegate platform. I believe that we should strive to maintain some level at burn as long as we run a profit. Ideally we would do this with a set fraction and set fractions going to other purposes. Due to technical limitations we\u2019re right now constrained to burning everything as long as the surplus buffer is full and nothing when it is not. In order to fully evaluate this change it isn\u2019t enough to look at the surplus buffer limit but also other events that contribute to either filling or emptying the surplus buffer. Oracles Core Unit has put in a request to pull 8.7M in expenses. At the current profit levels that would take around a month to build back. Granted there might be mitigating steps taken but that is going to shave off a week or so of this time.If we start increasing the surplus buffer at the same time it\u2019s going to delay the start of the burn by around two more weeks at 1M a week increase. My preference at this time would therefore be no increase until we are back on 60M and then a gradual increase to 90M. Add a GUSD Peg Stability Module Voted: Yes Reasoning: The most important obligation of the protocol is to keep the peg. This gives us another asset that will help maintain it and it diversifies us from other assets all in all a big plus in my book. Increase the Aave D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling Voted: Yes Reasoning: The D3M is a way for us to stabilize the interest of DAI and to capture some of the value from its use outside of MakerDAO. I appreciate the gradual phasing in of this and given that risk as deemed it safe to do so support increasing the debt ceiling. This will also help grow our profitability. ",

This is very much in the direction laid out in the case for green money. It is also a fairly substantial sum that is question. It seems to me this project also carries a potential to scale further. Overall I think this is a compelling case for both growing the profits of the protocol and getting more DAI into circulation. Community Greenlight Poll - SB-frOGI (SolidBlock Red Frog Digital Coin) Voted: No Reasoning: This one took a lot of thinking, but in the end I landed on that I believe it is best for Maker DAO to focus their limited capacity elsewhere at this time. This project is also a real world project asking for funding to real estate projects. In this project there is the added complexity of having another tokenization model to deal with. I don\u2019t see any immediate scaling with this project either. That being said we might find room for this or something similar further down the line. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 02. December 2021 Increase the Dust Parameter for Most Vault Types Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is an unfortunate step because it increases the bar to get access to the majority of our vaults. I fear higher dust limits will limit our growth. We have no control over the prices of gas however and have to take steps to protect the protocol from losses in the event of liquidations. Hopefully we can find solutions that makes these vaults more accessible again in the near future. Increase the Dust Parameter for ETH-B Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is also a case of protecting vaults in the event of liquidations due to high gas prices. In this particular case I\u2019m less concerned than with the other vaults as ETH-B represents a more risky vault and I think we should be able to expect more from users of such vaults. Of course ideally we want to find solutions that we don\u2019t have to for these kinds of vaults too. Use the MakerDAO Treasury to Fund MKR Expenses Voted: Yes Reasoning: Part of the draw of the MKR token is the narrative that there is 1.000.000 tokens or less in existence. As long as we have a treasury of them I vastly prefer to draw from this over issuing new ones. Primarily I would not support issuing new MKR at all, but if we are to do it we need to have a long and good discussion about how we are going to go about it. Issuing MKR is burning in reverse and we\u2019ve seen the effects of postponing the burn. Add GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A as a new Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: It\u2019s always nice to be able to support onboarding of a new vault and watch Maker grow. This goes straight to my principle of wanting to grow profitability. I want to add that in the light of the recent discussions surrounding offboarding of other vaults that by taking this stance we should also be willing to let this vault run for a while to give it a chance to show it\u2019s worth. One Time Payment to the GovComms CU to Deal with Budget Issues Voted: Yes Reasoning: In the field of human endeavours mistakes are going to be made. I believe in correcting honest mistakes with a minimum amount of friction. Hopefully we can learn something from this and avoid similar mistakes in the future. Perhaps this can also help build a case for making a separate accounting CU. Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee Voted: Yes Reasoning: In my view these changes to parameters are largely based on changing market conditions. Most, if all of them, are tweaks so there shouldn\u2019t be any dramatic effects. I\u2019m happy to see that this will add more revenue and thus profitability to the protocol. Add CurveLP-stETH-ETH as a new Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another ETH vault. I predict that staked Ethereum is just going to grow in popularity as we go forward. Making a vault for this asset is prudent and in line with growing the profitability of the protocol. I am a little concerned that we are setting the dust limit too low in light of the proposal of increasing it from 10k to 15k for all similar vault types. ",

Along with this there are some other parameter changes that will allow for faster debt growth and quicker liquidations. It is always nice to see a new vault type gain popularity and given that we do not incur undue risk I happily support these changes. Growth in our vaults leads to growth in our profit. Adjust MATIC-A System Parameters Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal is to increase the debt ceiling of the MATIC-A vault. This vault type has survived two recent attempts to offboard it so it is really good to see it gain some traction. I think it also serves as a reminder that we need to have some patience with different vault types as they may not start out profitable. Now that the momentum is positive I think it\u2019s urgent that we allow it to fulfill its potential. We may have gotten off on the wrong foot but right now it seems that we\u2019re heading for a bright future. ",

Neither Indicated Percentage of Real AAVEv2 DAI Supply 2. 25% of Real AAVEv2 DAI Supply 3. 30% of Real AAVEv2 DAI Supply Reasoning: I believe the D3M modules represents a useful way to provide DAI through third parties, and especially for users who are locked out of participating in Maker Vaults due to dust limits. As such I\u2019m happy to support proposals that increase the amounts we can provide. Unfortunately in this particular case risk recommended keeping the supply to 15-20%. I highly value the expert opinion of risk and would therefore primarily prefer to keep the supply at those levels. That being said, we are in an expansion phase and as such we might have to condone a little elevated risk for some time so I\u2019ll support further increase although at a lower priority. DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Net Rates Spread Voted: Yes Reasoning: This poll is tied to the previous one. The target rate of the D3M module is going to have a direct effect on how much of the debt ceiling we can utilize. The lower the rates the higher the utility. On the flip side, lower rates on the D3M makes it more attractive to borrow through Aave rather directly from Maker Vaults. This reduction in target rate makes it a little more attractive to borrow through Aave but still for the majority of use cases it\u2019s cheaper to use Maker vaults directly. I\u2019m not overly concerned how we put the DAI into circulation because at the end of the day, Maker DAO ends up with the interest from the issue either directly or through the D3M. Overall I expect this to increase DAI supply from current levels. Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier Voted: Abstain Reasoning: I was asked about delegate compensation in my introduction video and I will restate some of what I said there. In matters of delegate compensation I will as a main rule always abstain. That is because I see it as impossible to hold an unbiased view on the matter as long as I am an acting delegate. My preferred solution to questions of this type to be solved without any involvement of delegates at all. ",

Monet-supply made a compelling risk arguement here. Hopefully the issues can be adressed and we can have a future fruitful collaberation. Community Greenlight Poll - G-UNIv3-DAIUSDP (Gelato UniswapV3 DAI-USDP LP Token) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: This is another onboarding application for a collateral type. For this collateral I fear we might be too late to the party and even so I have doubts this will prove profitable. I don\u2019t think it will pose a direct risk to the protocol however so we might try it out but I think our resources are better employed elsewhere.

                    "content": "Polls ending January 13. 2022 Prioritize Onboarding a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Compound is another big player in DeFi space. Establishing a D3M with them allows us to capture some revenue from people unwilling or unable to interact with Maker directly. As we continue to add D3Ms we need to be mindful not only of the individual risks posed by each one but the systemic and cumulative risks that goes into the combination of them. On a more positive note I\u2019m excited to see us grow and find new ways to generate revenue. Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold Voted: Yes Reasoning: It is important to maintain an emergency option, but lately we have seen a few actors getting close to being able to trigger this shutdown on their own. It is also a potential malicious attack vector for someone looking to get rid of a bothersome competitor at 7,5% of the value of the protocol. This move increases the threshold to just over 10%. A step in a safer direction without making it impossible to use. Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another Direct Deposit Module, this one still differs that it\u2019s not connected to a big established actor in DeFi. The proposal is interesting and even though there are parameters that needs defining I think it\u2019s interesting enough that it warrants looking further into. Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is more or less housecleaning from the last round of increasing dust limits. While I regret the necessity of doing so it must be done to maintain risk at an acceptable level. Hopefully we will see gas prices come down or our own L2 solutions come online so we can become more accessable. Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow Voted: No Reasoning: This is a very reasonable request. In general I think we should make an effort to recover these funds, but I also recognize there are a lot of others who have also lost funds in similar circumstances. Before we do these kinds of recoveries I believe we ought to have a policy in place that describes how we handle these kinds of situations. Such a policy is even being worked on as we speak. While I recognize the terrible situation the entity that lost those funds to be in, I want to reassure that we are talking about a delay until we can treat everyone fairly. I would also like to underline that a delay is vastly preferable to funds being lost permanently which is a very real possibility in other parts of crypto. The proposal as written is a one-off solution for a single actor. It will leave us open to accusations that we are catering to a select group, further alienating smaller actors. ",

As a result I\u2019m happy we\u2019ve established the Open Market Committee to suggest changes in parameters to various vaults.

Decrease the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal is not covered by the mandate of the Open Market Committee. It follows in the same vein as the previous proposal and my reasoning remains much the same. I can\u2019t see this proposal be to the detriment of our users nor to increase our risk unacceptably. So all in all I support it. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending January 24. 2022 Community Greenlight Poll - OGN (Origin Protocol) Voted: Yes Reasoning: After a helpful reminder from Long For Wisdom here, and getting assurances that action is being taken to reduce our backlog of earlier greenlit collateral onboarding applications my assesment is that the application is strong enough for CUs to start doing a real assessment on the validity. One aspect I\u2019m going to particular look for in the next round of assessment is going to be profitability. I want to avoid onboarding a collateral that takes too long to turn profitable and having to go through a process of offboarding shortly after. Community Greenlight Poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Much the same reasoning as the previous collateral (in fact they are part of the same application). Hopefully this can turn fruitful, but will have to be examined closer. Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another greenlight poll. I\u2019m really happy we are getting traction on our backlog which was my main concern regarding this application. The way @Scarlet_Chen har interacted with the community does her and her project credit and should be looked to for inspiration for other applicants. Concerns have been raised and answered. It seems to me there is a lot of alignment between Robinland and Maker. Further work by the CUs will determine just how compatible we are but given the level of communication so far I\u2019m more than hopeful an agreement can be reached. Community Greenlight Poll - TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD) Voted: No Reasoning: It\u2019s always a sad day when I need to turn down an application because I know the amount of work involved. However I still think it\u2019s better to give an up front answer when I don\u2019t think this proposal will make it through the process. This is not the first time TUSD have applied to Maker. Unfortunately I don\u2019t see any of the concerns that were raised in the previous application have been addressed and thus I don\u2019t see any reason this one will get another outcome. Transparency is a very important quality and one fundamental to proper assessment of risk. When that is lacking there is little hope moving forward. Community Greenlight Poll - USDap (BondAppetit) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another greenlight poll. This one holds promise as well. It will naturally add to the workload of the CUs but again I think a closer assessment is worth the effort involved. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) (MIP40c3-SP45) Voted: Yes Reasoning: An increase in the budget for Oracles mainly to account for expected increases in gas costs and to repay the foundation for fronting gas costs for us for the end of 2021. One of my core values is maintaining obligations and repaying debt is a very serious obligation. I\u2019m happy to see this settled but I do wish when we interact with another entity that the documentation would be clearer. I expect other partners will expect the same from us as we go forward. Ratification Poll for Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This core unit is meant to maintain the infrastructure of the protocol. A vital function and I\u2019m  happy they get established. This is an easy proposal to support. As a support function it\u2019s somewhat harder to define clear goals for it, but what we have so far will have to serve. Ratification Poll for the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is a core unit I have high hopes for. Bringing two highly talented individuals together in order to get a closer look at the overall financial health of the protocol and to assist in strategic decision making when it comes to the allocation of capital. I suspect there is room for improvement in this area and I believe this core unit is capable of finding it. Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Maintaining obligations is one of my core values and one of the keys to that is to manage expectations. Well thought out and founded processes is one tool to manage expectations. Our experience with previous collateral offboarding has revealed the need for a better process and now one has been approved. I\u2019m really happy this is coming. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47) Voted: Yes Reasoning: If we want to remain relevant in the cryptoshere we need to develop for the sidechains. Granting this budget allows work to continue to adopt Maker to L2 and has my full support. Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64) Voted: Yes Reasoning: If we want to maintain our obligations then we need to make sure our protocol remains safe. This program is designed to help us uncover weaknesses before they become serious issues. As is the case with all security measures I really hope it\u2019s unnecessary, but in a complex world this is rarely the case. Security can be an underappreciated field but this proposal will help secure Maker\u2019s value. Ratification Poll for Maker Keeper Network (MIP63) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Keepers are another essential part of the Maker ecosystem. They are responsible for many things but perhaps the most prominent is being the counterpart in liquidation auctions. Needless to say should those auctions fail, our whole protocol fails. This proposal makes it easier for third party keepers to interface with Maker. This should make their jobs easier and might attract more keepers over time. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) Voted: No Reasoning: This is another proposal that goes straight to my value of maintaining obligations. In my view once we bring on a core unit we have certain responsibilities towards said unit. One of those to me is to act in a predictable manner. In this particular case I am of the opinion that Content Production has not received enough time to prove their value. I also think there has been a clash of expectations in what this core unit is supposed to deliver. First and foremost I think there should be a clearer process for how we offboard both core units and facilitators. Given that we are in a situation without those I will need a clearer statement of exact statements of what the core unit were supposed to deliver and what they haven\u2019t delivered. Even showing that I think it\u2019s reasonable to give the core unit a chance to correct for a failure to deliver before we offboard. Offboarding carries several costs. It has the opportunity cost of all the things that is not done before we optionally onboard a new core unit, and it has the reputation cost of others seeing how we conduct our offboardings. It may also cause members of other core units to reconsider their commitment to Maker given that it has been shown that is a more unstable place of employment than earlier thought. In light of things that have come up during this discussion I do think Content Production do have some earlier promises they need to deliver on, but they deserve a chance to do so. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I believe that Real World Finance holds a lot of promise when it comes to growing Maker. As such I\u2019m paying extra close attention to what happens in this core unit. I\u2019m happy the process of changing facilitator is about to come to an end. Both the person stepping down and the person stepping up as facilitator have impressed me with their insights on the forum and I\u2019m confident Real World Finance is going to do great things for Maker the coming years. Ratification Poll for Development & UX Core Unit Budget - DUX-001 (MIP40c3-SP52) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is minor adjustments to the budget of Development & UX. I don\u2019t see anything unreasonable in this. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) (MIP40c3-SP55) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another mostly technical adjustment of the budget. It also extends it but I don\u2019t see anything controversial so I will support it. ",

This was done as an emergency meassure until a better solution can be placed into effect. I urged the community to make that a priority here. From what I\u2019ve gathered the most immediate fix is to put in a throttle on the rate of the surplus auctions. The more long term solutions will be to implement liquidity 2.0 (reverse dutch auctions) auctions. This is the type of auctions we use for our liquidation auctions. Hopefully the market turbulence will settle soon and a workable solution will be in place. As much as I support keeping the burn going, the primary concern must be for the immediate health and safety of the protocol. I will work to restore the burn as soon as it is safe to do so. ",

Of not is the start of the new strategic finance core unit and the substantial sum that goes to the oracles core unit. Included in the funds for oracles is the establishment of an emergency fund to ensure that there will be sufficient ETH available even in the event of a massive spike in gas costs. I have voted in favor of all the budget proposals earlier so it\u2019s an easy support. The one immediate downside I see is that this will lower our surplus buffer by ~15%, which is a little bit unnerving given that we this same week suspended the burn due to concerns of inefficiencies in burning as well as the worry of a cascading market downturn resulting in bad debt for the protocol. In the absence of liquidation penalties it is going to take us around a month to build back that same buffer. ",

The advantage of doing so is to move counterparty risk from USDC over to Stable+. A version of putting our eggs in more baskets. As an added incentive there is the possibility of a low yield over no yield. The proposed structure leaves some questions regarding the experience of Stable+ to handle such transactions, it also leaves some questions on debt portfolio management and a clear picture of the total risk incurred to Maker. However, this is a greenlight poll. GFX Labs and Paperimperium have so far shown an excellent willingness to engage with the community in addressing concerns and at this stage I have no reason to doubt they will continue to do so. I am not certain this proposal will pass scrutiny once more details are put under the microscope, but on the other hand I\u2019m not convince it will be rejected either. Our growing holdings of USDC should be resolved in some way and this proposal has at least someone working on it. Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-TBILL (US Treasury Securities Up To 12 Months Duration) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal is the same as the above but with different maturity times for the securities. As such the reasoning laid out above also applies here. From my point of view, a shorter duration of the securities gives up less of the liquidity that is a major reason of having the PSM and thus probably is the one with the most promise. ",

My default stance is to support the Open Market Committee in their work. Watching rates, and thus our revenues, fall is not pleasant but for now necessary. If we continue in this direction however I\u2019m concerned for our profit margins, and that we risk getting into the same position we were in the summer of '21 where revenue barely keeps up with our expenses. Especially concerning is the added effect the introduction of the Nexo vault will have on our overall revenue. I think we need to take the time and effort to do a closer study on the relationship between changing rates and debt retention so we don\u2019t end up lowering our rates too much for too little gain.

This is due to the inherent conflict of interest that is present in this issue. Offloading TUSD-A Voted: 1. Activate liquidations 2. Offload to a new TUSD-PSM with 0 Debt Ceiling Reasoning: The majority of TUSD vaults are undercollateralized at this point. As such it is time to correct our balance sheet. Given that the recent proposal to enact a TUSD PSM got overwhelming negative response it seems prudent to attempt another route if possible. Activating liquidations involves less engineering effort and thus lower opportunity cost. Either option is likely to result in losses to the protocol, but with liquidations it\u2019s quick and relatively painless. Going by my principle on selecting the less complex solution I will favor liquidations first. Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper Voted: Yes Reasoning: The most important reason for voting \u201cyes\u201d on this issue is because it is the quickest way to return to a normalized state following an urgent executive. After the massive wave of liquidations January 21. we passed an urgent executive the following week raising the surplus buffer to 250M. This was primarily done to protect the protocol from inefficient surplus auctions but also over worries that in a cascading liquidation scenario we might incur larger losses than our current surplus buffer can handle. In order to achieve these changes quickly an urgent executive was proposed and passed. When we deviate from standard governance process due to specific events or unforseen circumstances we need to return to a state of standard governance process. That means that any change has to be temporary in nature. If we do not change back then every urgent or emergency measure needs to be evaluated not only on the merits of the immediate situation, but also on the long term consequences. If we need to carefully weigh the long term consequences we should use the normal governance process to make sure we\u2019ve carefully considered all relevant facts, and their probable consequences. Failing to revert to normality will put a question on every future use of urgent or emergency executives. At best they will be slowed down, and at worst they will be denied because the long term consequences are unacceptable. In my opinion a rate limiter solves the immediate issues and thus allows us to return to a normal state of operation. A rate limiter will remove the worst inefficiencies of surplus auctions (making it almost impossible to get away with extremely low bids). It is also going to give us an immediate injection to the surplus buffer in the event of mass liquidations. This temporary shield will help us avoid us if the market trend continues downwards and a further wave of liquidations hit. Would I like to see a more efficient way to burn our surplus DAI? Absolutely, but the place to discuss that is from a position of normal governance. ",

Keeping the peg is the most fundamental obligation the protocol has to deliver on. Having a variety of PSMs reduces the individual counterparty risk, making us more robust in the face of potential troubles with either one of them. The GUSD PSM has shown a potential to reach its current debt ceiling. Increasing this keeps us within acceptable risk levels. As such I support raising the debt ceiling with 10M. ",

The reason it is brought up is because he missed the performance requirements by less than a % point. It is also worth noting that the requirements were at the time just introduced so a single missed vote would have big consequences for the performance. Given the rather large difference in payment that 1% constitutes my opinion is that MakerMan should get compensation for the month in question. This compensation is also not a full compensation but rather the reduced compensation that was introduced in the following month. All things considered this seems like a reasonable course of action to me and thus I support this poll. ",

To me it is important that governance does not become blocked and a delegate should recognize when their view is not the majority view. Abstaining or refusing to support an executive should in my opinion only be considered if there is a reasonable expectation that the executive will be actively harmful to the protocol. ",

Recognizing when to change roles is a major strength in any organization. I\u2019m very happy to welcome @0xdeniz as the new facilitator and expect he\u2019ll do great work in bringing the core unit forward. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, RISK-001 Voted: Yes Reasoning: While the increase in the proposed budget might seem excessive at first glance we\u2019re talking about a substantial increase in contributors. In my opinion RISK have been delivering value and I expect they will be able to add even more with an expanded team. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Collateral Engineering Services, CES-001 (MIP40c3-SP57) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is to continue funding Collateral Engineering Services (CES). CES is an important piece in the growth and maintainance of Maker. It is also involved in further developing real world assets. After reviewing the budget proposal I find it reasonable and thus support it. Ratification Poll for MIP55 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP16) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal is an ammendment to MIP-55. The main purpose of the ammendment was to clarify the DAI limits on which kind of proposals go to the weekly and which proposals goes into the monthly governance cycle. More clarity means less complexity and less room for error, as such I support the proposal. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, Immunefi Security (IS-001) (MIP40c3-SP58) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is a 12 month funding for the Immunefi Security core unit. Maintaining the security of the protocol is almost as important as maintaining the peg. If we fail on either the protocol is dead. As such I support this proposal that helps us achieve the needed security. As a side note, I wish all the core units operated with the same time frame. I suspect a 12 month timeframe makes the most sense as a balance between potential losses and governance overhead. Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Tech-Ops (MIP63c4-SP1) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Every organization needs someone to be able to grease the wheels to keep operations running. This is the role of the Tech-Ops core unit and I\u2019m happy to have them join the family. Ratification Poll for Onboarding the Maker Talent Core Unit (MT-001) Voted: No Reasoning: I want to start this by saying I believe in @manomad and the team he has assembled. In my view, the protocol is now grown to the size of an organization that is going to need a more diverse set of skills from its contributors. As such I welcome the creation of this core unit. However, this core units primary audience and customer base are the other core units. As the core units are autonomous and free to choose whether they want to employ the expertise Maker Talent brings to the table I believe it is critical for the success of this core unit that there is sufficient will among the other core units to actually use them. I want to set up core units for success and not for failing and necessitating an off-boarding process 6 months down the line. After reviewing feedback from other parts of the community I am of the opinion that the support at this time is insufficient. That being said I think that is possible to remedy, but this proposal should brought up again in the next governance cycle. It is never pleasant to have to take a negative stance but I really want Maker Talent to fly and serve as an inspiration and a guiding beacon for bringing new areas of expertise into the Maker community. To achieve this they deserve the very best starting position. Ratification Poll for Intangible Asset Assignment (MIP60) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal brings more clarity on which actors manage which intangible assets. Coordination of this kind is to be expected as the protocol grows and is important to get in place before it turns into a point of dispute. I support this effort to bring more clarity to this field and the processes it outlines. A personal note The events of this past week has been dramatic and I have been personally affected given that my in-laws reside in Ukraine. I hope everyone takes a moment to reflect on the blessing it is to live in safety. Having to help my extended family survive and get to safety while having to decide on what to leave behind has been heartbreaking. I fear this situation may interfere somewhat with my work, but I hope the situation will be resolved peacefully soon. ",

I\u2019m looking forward to the time when we once again can increase stability fees. Even so I think its important that we react to changing market conditions and maintain Makers reputation as a fair actor, so I support this proposal. Adding Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions Voted: Yes Reasoning: I\u2019m excited to see the Rate Limiter get ready to get implemented. This have been in the works since flappy Friday and will both help secure the protocol in the event of mass liquidations and help avoid inefficient surplus auctions by limiting the maximum number of parallel ones.

This proposal sets the parameters to ensure that happens. While this is going to result in some losses to the protocol, those losses are already here, this is merely acknowledging them. It also cleans up our books by no longer appearing to generate revenue from these vaults which we know we will never receive. Reinstate Surplus Buffer Lerp Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is an issue that is very important to me and frankly one of the reasons I even got started as a delegate. The way its been handled by the protocol has shaken my faith in the project. What was supposed to be a immediate response to a threatening situation has in bad faith been turned into a question on whether or not we should have burn at all. Turning off the burn took one vote totally bypassing the whole of the ordinary governance process, but trying to get it restored has so far taken 2 different signal requests, 1 executive and now we\u2019re on the third signal request to try to make it happen. It is increasingly clear to me that actors within the Maker community, especially those working directly with core units are openly opposed to burning MKR. That is understandable, after all their pay comes directly from the surplus buffer, they have a direct economic incentive to make sure it is perpetually filled up. However, where does that leave MKR holders? If this proposal doesn\u2019t pass there is no economic incentive to hold MKR tokens. With current levels of profitability (which have been falling dramatically for the past months) burning may resume in 2026(!). I have seen fantasies of having a surplus buffer of one billion or more, but nothing in our pipeline is showing any promise of even filling the 250M that its currently set for. Even the argument that the surplus buffer has anything to do with risk to the protocol is rapidly losing relevance as we are already between the 2-3% of surplus to non-stablecoin ratio. In addition we have now implemented a rate limiter to further protect the protocol in a cascading downwards scenario. Should this proposal fail I\u2019m certain that we will see MKR tokens continue to decline in value relative to ETH as only the larger holders of MKR will maintain their positions and then only because the limited liquidity makes an exit impossible.

Realize that there is zero correlation to MKR price to burn. I appreciate you taking the burn side here JustinCase and keep plugging away.    If taking what resources we have now and putting them to work to grow DAI, and hence revenues, is less important compared to throwing DAI capital assets away to remove MKR assets off the book at high prices while thinking, somehow magically, Maker will be able to sell MKR to raise cash (flop) when Maker has a surplus hole is the best use of assets at this time. Evidence from Black Thursday stands in stark contrast to the whitepaper assertion and promise and as the best evidence that the above is NOT the best approach to build value for MKR holders. If I am a DAI holder (and I am BTW, but really I am a net DAI borrower) that got left with a 6% hole in my collateral backing for an entire week during Black Thursday I have to wonder whether in the future I could be left holding empty DAI because governance failed to plan.   Governance need to not just manage the surplus buffer but using all assets (MKR and DAI) to earn return for the DAO to buy things that build a treasury so instead of flopping to fill any DAI shortfall Maker has productive assets to fall back on for borrowing. Wouldn\u2019t the above be a more prudent use of tangible assets than basically using one asset to destroy another? If you had MKR and DAI in your own wallet wouldn\u2019t you be taking that MKR and that DAI and looking for return vs. buying more MKR with the DAI only to \u2018burn\u2019 MKR so maybe in the future you could mint more MKR to raise DAI to pay bills?

Ratification Poll for Facilitators Offboarding (MDS-001) (MIP41c5-SP5) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: With the facilitators of the Core Unit confirming they are stepping down voluntarily after the proposal going on-chain it has lost its relevance. Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The GovAlpha core unit is perforing an essential function in ensuring that protocol governance is running efficiently and in accordance with previously agreed upon rules. They are also asking for a modest budget to continue their operations. As much as I believe we need to be much more critical of budget proposals going forward, this particular one does not seem to be the first one that needs to be reduced. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal caused difficulty in reaching a decision. I am a firm beliver in the potential of real world assets and in the value of bridging the traditional world with crypto. I also believe that having high quality legal assistance on what is the frontier of finance and unexplored legal territory is both necessary and prudent. That being said, the total amount asked for in this budget is very high. It is going to put a considerable strain on the surplus buffer. It also poses a significant risk to the Maker protocol if the core unit decides to not live up to its obligations to MakerDAO. We have seen that offboarding core units doesn\u2019t automatically come with return of excess funding. The deciding factor to me was that in a plausable scenario of rising interest rates and a reduced risk appetite potentially leading to a bear market for crypto, real world assets shows the biggest promise for revenue growth going forward. Nothing in this world comes without risk, and in this particular case I landed just on the side of attempting. I really wish we had scaled back the scope somewhat on the total amount of deals, and rather focused more on a few larger showcases to lay the foundation before committing as much resources as we do. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) Voted: Yes Reasoning: As stated above I value the work done by GovAlpha very highly. Giving MKR vesting to two important contributors to the protocol is long overdue and will further align their interests with that of the protocol as a whole. This alignment of incentives is important and as such it is good to see this becoming a standard in all of GovAlpha. Going further I think we need to re-evaluate contributor compensation packages to focus more on MKR staking and less on DAI. Overall a proposal I very much support. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network (MIP63c4-SP3) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Keeping a healthy keeper network is important to the protocol and this proposal will allow us to grow it. The costs are very low so overall this seems like a good move. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP2) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another addition to the keeper network. Much the same reasoning as the proposal directly above. It is also worth noting that increased diversification also increases our redundancy and robustness. Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal moves the decision of small bug bounty payouts from the protocol level to a core unit. This helps increase efficiency and supports core unit autonomy. It has the added benefit of reducing governance overhead. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of increased risk. It increases the reliance that Immunify will act in good faith and that it will be distribute bounties fairly to the benefit of the protocol. Overall I think the benefits outweigh the risks, but we need to be mindful of the limited options available to the protocol in the event of a core unit failing in its responsibilities. Ratification Poll for Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Due to the obvious conflict of interest in this proposal I abstained the vote. I do think it is worth pointing out that if every delegate did this the proposal would be unable to meet the minimum votes required to pass. This would also be the case with almost every other recent proposal put to a vote including executives. Should the delegates stop voting protocol governance would become significantly less effective and that is without considering the research each delegate puts into their respective votes. In an ideal world there should be some other mechanism with which delegate compensation is discussed and decided. Hopefully this vote can serve as a demonstration of the value delegates brings to this community. ",

Short Ratification Poll for SPF ETHAmsterdam Event (MIP55c3-SP3) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal seeks funding to host an event at ETHAmsterdam. At the time of the proposal several Core Units have already pre-paid for the same event. This creates a situation where lack of additional funding puts previously committed resources at risk. As such the decision can not be evaluated entirely on its own merit. Supporting such a proposal sets a precedent that core units can gain leverage on an initiative by putting in their own funding first, undermining a regular governance process. That is a precedent I\u2019m reluctant to set. Furthermore I am wary of spending resources on marketing until we have a clear marketing strategy in place. I am a big proponent of increasing our marketing efforts, in fact one of the first things I looked into after starting as a delegate was marketing initiatives. However, marketing has its own science behind it and we should approach it in a professional and deliberate manner. In sum I am therefore not supporting this proposal. Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge Voted: Yes Reasoning: Getting into L2s require that we dip our toes. This proposal sets initial parameters with 5M DAI as the limit. Should be big enough to test validity and small enough that if anything goes wrong we\u2019re not too badly burnt. Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal amends MIP62 to account for the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit. Housekeeping that needs to be done. Investigate Implementation of a Notional Finance D3M Voted: Yes Reasoning: We are experiencing a period of declining revenue and increasing expenses. There are many proposals that wants to increase our spending but few that looks to increasing our revenue. This one is one of them. This poll is for investigating implementation as confirmed by governance and as such should have a low bar for acceptance. I am not sure it\u2019s the best idea that delegates initiates proposals, but as of time of writing we have not implemented a policy on the matter nor made any other decision that it should be disqualifying. In sum I think this proposal has enough merit to warrant a closer look and once that is done do an evaluation on further action. ",

By burning MKR, you incentivize holders to sell the token; companies and DAOs should strive to generate long-term demand for the stock/token, not incentivize investors to purchase and sell to cash out on the profit generated by the entity. When looking at traditional tech companies experiencing rapid growth (i.e. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.), you would be hard-pressed to find any that offer a dividend. The Maker ecosystem and the entire crypto industry are on the verge of unseen levels of growth. With so many exciting opportunities for Maker to deploy capital, it seems irrational to burn profit because we want to provide dividends to MKR holders. Investments made by Maker to progress the ecosystem will create returns far exceeding investors\u2019 cost of capital and will generate greater returns via deployment than burning the token. The aforementioned tech companies chose not to distribute dividends because they believe that they have excellent investment opportunities to deploy capital towards. Maker is in a similar situation and should follow a similar strategy. ",

I\u2019ve said this before but reinvesting funds in mkr will be all about trust in the core units and in mkr governance.  If capital is deployed well, then you will get the growth you seek.  But it can also be deployed poorly and wasted.  Anyway, it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re headed toward giving CUs free reign over all profits.  We shall see if the promised growth follows. ",

This represents an annual dividend yield, at the time of writing, of .5%. In contrast, comparing the MKR burn rate to a dividend, Maker offers an annual dividend yield of 2.78% (5.6x larger than the dividend offered on Apple stock and down from an all time high of 9.32% on January 22, 2022. Maker will likely have a greater amount of opportunities to deploy capital towards than Apple, yet the dividend amount does not seem to be reflective of this. Burning MKR could be appropriate in some situations, however to take a hard line to always burn the token because we can and believe that there is a 1:1 transfer of value to the token holder seems misguided and rarely true in reality. When comparing the burn rate of MKR to its price, there is very little correlation (if not an inverse relation) between the burn rate and the value of the token.

PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: No Reasoning: I will start by saying I have a lot of respect for the work the Open Market Committee does and in most cases I will follow their recommended proposal. In the current situation however there are two factors that have caused me to go against the proposal. The first being that we are currently in a world of rising interest rates across the board. While that has yet to manifest directly in crypto it is my clear belief this is coming. In a raising rate environment it doesn\u2019t make much sense to lower our own rates. Secondly we have previously shown that we are slow to increase rates when market conditions change, as such I\u2019m reluctant to support yet another reduction in rates. Our revenue is already perilously low, and past rate reductions has not shown a decisive effect on retaining vaults nor increasing them. At the very least we could have waited a little longer before implementing changes. Launch Maker Wormhole With Optimism and Arbitrum Domains Voted: Yes Reasoning: I have become less optimistic on the value proposal of deploying on the various L2s. Even so, it is still too early to consider cancelling exploring growth in that direction. Maker Wormhole will hopefully prove to be a good step in the right direction in making Optimism and Arbitrum an area of profitable expansion for Maker. We must still keep in mind the added risk these deployments entail and how that might restrict other growth opportunities. ",

This one contains several items which I voted against. It is going to incur and estimated 6M reduction in revenue from the MOMC parameter changes as well as an additional expense of 50k DAI to the ETHAmsterdam Event. This will reduce our surplus buffer as well as hamper our ability to refill it. Currently the surplus buffer is at the same level it was when we suspended burning on January 23rd more than two months ago. With the proposed changes it is possible and even likely that we will be in a scenario with a diminishing surplus buffer. Even so these are not immediate threats and the community has made their choice. As such I will support this executive and work to try to improve our financial situation. As stated in my delegate platform I will prioritize increasing revenue over cutting costs, but in the current environment cutting costs seems unavoidable. Going forward I will therefore be much more reluctant to support any proposal that increases our expenses without showing a likely increase in revenues that exceeds the increase in expenses in a short to medium time frame. This includes any expansions to Core Unit budgets. . ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 25th of April 2022 Ratification Poll for Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh (MIP39c2-SP30) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This updated mandate provides a somewhat increased emphasis on external communication and messaging. While I do think that part is premature before a proper marketing and branding strategy is in place I do think it will be a natural part for govcoms to engage in further down the line. As such an updated mandate makes sense, but the funding for it should be withheld until a more mature time. Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) Voted: Yes Reasoning: With Content Producion Core Unit off-boarded it doesn\u2019t make any sense to keep this Multi-Sig around. Housekeeping that shouldn\u2019t be very controversial nor work intensive. Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Lack of capacity in Protocol Engineering represents one of the biggest bottlenecks for further development of the protocol. Even though this budget like most others represents an increase in spending I\u2019m more comfortable that this spending will result in increased revenues further down the line. Very little of what the protocol attempts to do is possible without some kind of involvement from PE. In light of that and to increase redundancy I think it is prudent to start to consider establishing a PE-002. Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) Voted: No Reasoning: Data Insights is a Core Unit that provides data to other core units and to the protocol at large. This budget proposal represents an increase of more than 50%. Having received mixed feedback from the core units already served by DI I do not think this added cost will benefit the protocol. I\u2019m also wary that CUs start express desire to work outside of the protocol. Using services from providers to multiple partners is fine but it is hard to justify a permanent budget from Maker in such a case. Ultimately I think this Core Unit needs to prove its value by vying for business directly from the core units and not from Maker at the protocol level. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Governance Communications have proposed a new budget that is quite a bit larger from the previous one. I am not thrilled by what seems like inefficiencies in parts of the proposed expenses. A continuation budget should not see this much growth and casts doubts about previous budgets, in particular given that the core unit still has a fair amount of remaining funds. That being said I think GovComms delivers an important service to the protocol and I would not want to put them at risk of being off-boarded at this time. They have also managed to separate their recurring budget from their expanding one which I think is commendable. So considering all factors I land on a very weak yes for this proposal. Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) Voted: No Reasoning: As I wrote in the updated mandate. I do not think this is the right time for GovComs to expand. We need to establish a brand and a message to convey before hiring people to start conveying it. Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team Voted: Yes Reasoning: In order to remain profitable we need to have effective teams in place to onboard new collatteral. This proposal should help CES increase their effectiveness. Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) Voted: Yes Reasoning: As a growing protocol it is natural to review and update various processes. This particular proposal changes the application form for collateral. It is my belief this will ultimately make it easier for counterparties to work with us as it gives more clarity in what we are looking for when we evaluate various collateral. I\u2019m a proponent of less complexity, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can do away with all of it. Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) Voted: No Reasoning: As I have stated previously I don\u2019t think we should engage in marketing without a solid plan in place first. This proposal seeks to establish a core unit for events without us having done a proper analysis of whether or not the protocol actually needs to host events or what revenue or other advantage they might generate. Given that onboarding creates both expectations and obligations I\u2019m very reluctant to do so without any confidence this is something that is acutally needed. I do not doubt the ability of this Core Unit to deliver what they promise, there is actually credible track record that they should be able to, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right strategic choice until we have an established marketing and branding strategy in place. Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) Voted: Yes Reasoning: As with the collateral application above it is natural that we improve other processes. This particular proposal should improve the current process for structured finance transactions. I do expect we will have to come back to this one once we gain more relevant experience, but for now it\u2019s an improvement over what we had. Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) Voted: No Reasoning: Given the current market conditions I do not think fixed-rates is something we should work on. Our backlog is substantial and I think other areas holds more promise for expanding revenues and gaining market shares. In addition this proposal seems expensive for what it does. Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) Voted: No Reasoning: Given the feedback received so far on the work carried out by Data Insight it seems unwise to give them increased responsibilities and mandate. A focus on improving current deliveries should come first or even the creation of a different Core Unit could solve the same issues. ",

The running costs of having this vault should be minimal given the reuse of existing oracles. We might even attract some users that didn\u2019t have their needs met by existing vaults and might see some migration from wstETH-A vaults. The only thing I\u2019m not fully in agreement with is the name. Going by the convention of our other vaults this has the profile of a -C vault and I fear it might be confusing for vault users. Extend Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Budget Until May Governance Cycle Voted: No Reasoning: I\u2019m a big believer in maintaining core unit autonomy. To get the best results there should not be too much micro management from the protocol level. However with this autonomy comes the obligation of responsibility. Having a failed budget proposal or failing to meet budget proposal deadlines should fall under the responsibility of the core unit in question. It is one way to influence core units to not ask for unreasonable budgets. In addition this particular proposal seem excessive for the time period its intended to cover. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - HVBANK (Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Collateral) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Greenlight poll for a proposal that touches into the RWF realm. This one has a few more stumbling blocks than on-chain collateral but I think overall there is enough promise here to warrant a closer look.

This particular D3M will, if implemented, open previously untapped market. I can\u2019t see any showstoppers in this proposal so I approve looking at it more closely. A note on prioritization on greenlights in general: We are currently having a fair amount of greenlight polls. This is of course a good thing, but I\u2019m starting to wonder how many is too many? At some point adding another investigation is going to going to have to wait for a long time until given a more thorough investigation. I\u2019m grateful for the recent clean-up of our pipeline, but I do think we should have a little more critical information to evaluate even at the greenlight stage. For one I think there should be a very rough estimate of expected yearly revenue as well as a very rough estimate of engineering effort required. The process as it is now leaves too much of a backlog and not enough weight to prioritize the effort to the projects which is most strategically for MakerDAO. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: No Reasoning: This is the second time in a row I voted against the recomendations from the Open Market Committee. In general I am very much in favor of following the expert advice from the committee and my negative vote this time is not a firm \u201cno\u201d, but still an overall \u201cno\u201d. My opposition comes from the following 3 axis:  We are currently in a rising rate environment. Even though rates in crypto are going down I am a firm believer this is temporary and they will soon start to follow TradFi rates. The draws on the vaults seems to be much more influenced by general market sentiment than rates. I.E. if people expect crypto to boom they draw more from vaults and vice versa. Maker vaults are more stable and better able to handle large volumes than our competitors. For some vaults (In particular WBTC-B) the discrepancy between stability fee and risk premium is becoming troubling.  Weighing these concerns against the proposal presented I ultimately landed on not supporting the proposal. However going forward I expect to vote in favor of the proposals from the Open Market Committee. ",

In my view this proposal is within the Clean Money vision and it is with a partner I think will be a welcome one to Maker. This, to me, means we should be willing to go bellow market rates in order to support the vision. However, if we take on excessive risk compared to our revenues our ability to keep supporting the vision will be diminished as we will be more and more limited by keeping capital reserves. Community Greenlight Poll - IPCL (India Power Green Bonds) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal has the same issues and thus the same reasoning as the previous one. I would like to add that I think both of them have merit and could pass a greenlight. Another issue when viewing both proposals together is the required ad hoc work for both of them.

Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold Voted: Yes Reasoning: The emergency shutdown module is an action of last resort in order to prevent the protocol causing harm and to act as a final protection for minority interest holders. There has been some debate about what the correct level should be but I think this quote from LongForWisdom captures the essence of the issue:  \u201cThe severity of it being too high is quite low, the severity of it being too low is much, much higher.\u201d  As such I support rising the threshold while we investigate further to what the optimum should be. Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate Limited Flapper Voted: Yes Reasoning: I pledged to support this change back when we had the larger debate about temporarily halting the burn. This proposal will limit the rate of surplus auctions. This will lead to a situation where we will more gradually burn DAI for MKR in the event of a big spike in the surplus buffer. Typically what happens during a sharp market downturn. This change will still allow us a good rate once we get in a position to burn again. My main objection to this proposal as it stands is the timing. Currently we have an absurdly high SB limit that will take us years to reach under current market conditions. Spending engineering and governance effort on this proposal at this time seems to me to be poor prioritization. If I had not pledged to support this I would have voted against it due to the low optimization. I however strongly believe in commitment and staying true to promises made so I will support this proposal. ",

One of my core values is maintaining obligations and as such I stand by my word. In a wider sense this proposal will allow us to utilize some of the USDC we\u2019re holding for meaningful gains through a partnership with Monetalis. It is my belief that utilizing our stablecoin holdings in order to diversify counterparty risk and to increase revenue is critical in the current market condition and important to the future survival and success of this protocol. Monetalis and @Allan_Pedersen has shown a tremendous patience with our community and a willingness to engage with it. I think we do wisely to recognize the value in that. I also thing we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of urgency. A smaller and more dedicated partner is more likely to prioritize us and to more rapidly accommodate changing needs or requests from the protocol. We should also recognize the potential value of an early partnership as both partners have growth potential. Would I have preferred if they had extensive experience in bond management; yes. But to quote General Patton; \u201cA good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.\u201d We should have several different bond managers, this is to me a good start. Ratification Poll for Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending (MIP68) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal was harder to decide upon than MIP-65. I view this proposal as more risky and requiring more work both from us and from Monetalis. Everything I said previously concerning Monetalis still holds true and I doubtful others would still be putting in the effort to work with us after having faced the difficulties they have so far. That commitment has value. The engagement with the community has value. I\u2019m a believer that actions speaks louder than words and Monetalis has shown a willingness to put into action requests presented by us as a community. I do share concerns voiced for team bandwidth and the ability to execute. That being said, I still think we need to at least make an attempt at this. As a delegate and as an MKR holder I have to stress the importance of delivering value within RWA. In a raising rate environment this holds even more promise. I will urge the RWA teams, should they find they find their bandwidth exceeded, to present to the wider community a list of projects to prioritize. Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) Voted: Yes Reasoning: An easy proposal to support. This one lays groundwork to be able to deploy L2-to-L1 teleports. It\u2019s one more step in our work towards L2s. Ratification Poll for MIP40 Budget Process Amendment (MIP4c2-SP19) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Budgets and reviewing them is one of the most important decision points when it comes to Maker governance. As such I highly welcome more standardization in the field. As long as we don\u2019t use alternative methods to promote fiscal restraint, like competition, direct oversight remains necessary. While this is a step in the right direction I think there should be a future requirement to split any budget proposals into a continuation budget and growth/expansion budgets. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) Voted: No Resoning: It is always hard to vote against a proposal involving existing core units. In this particular case there is no doubt that @aburban90 has his heart in the right place. That being said, it\u2019s my role to consider whether any proposal is a net gain to the protocol or not. Despite the passion expressed on the forums and in real life we must be able to put some requirements on those who take on certain roles in the DAO. For someone to take on the mantle as facilitator the ability to produce an overview of expenses should be a task that should be manageable and not something that is \u201c80% done\u201d. Furthermore the compensation should match the kind of services provided. The level of compensation has been remarked upon by others than myself, but this endeavor is fairly close to a online merchandising store and shouldn\u2019t have markedly different compensation levels for such an entity despite being associated with Maker. This point rings particularly true in the current economic environment with rapidly declining revenues. There is also the necessity angle to consider. Will this benefit Maker enough to offset the resources put into it? In my view the answer to this is also \u201cno\u201d. I have earlier expressed an unwillingness to put resources into marketing without a clear strategy in place. We are unlikely to see such a plan until at least we have the Brand core unit up and running. ",

Hi Justin, Thanks for the feedback on the Executive Vote cadence. The past couple of Executive Votes have had office hours turned on so had to wait until Monday after the GSM Pause Delay expired to execute. The current Executive Vote does not have office hours turned on, so would execute on Sunday if passed today, for example. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 26th of May 2022 Investigate Implementation of an Antalpha Institutional Vault Voted: Yes Reasoning: I have not been the biggest fan of institutional vaults since I believe that the range of vaults we offer gives a fair range of choices that are balanced by the risk and revenue they bring to the protocol. However, I can recognize the wish for partners and counter parties to get an offering that provides a greater degree of stability. In the future we might look into mechanisms that gives Maker some stability back. This vault, if completed, will add to our existing pipeline of institutional vaults. My expectation is that onboarding these will become easier and easier as we gain experience and hopefully we can get to a point where they are close to fully decentralized. Assuming this vault doesn\u2019t cannibalize existing vaults it will be a welcome addition in a market that has shown a general tendency to reduce their vault exposure. Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another investigation poll. With this one I came close to voting no. While I understand the desire to place parts of our reserve into ETH I have some concerns that I hope to see addressed in the following investigation:  Maker is naturally long in ETH. When ETH rises so does value in our vaults and with it our revenues. So far our revenues have been increasing a lot more than the increase in our expenses in ETH. In the event of a need to cover bad debt the price of ETH is most likely depressed. Protecting the protocol is the primary function of the SB and it seems ill advised to put ourselves in a position to have a shrinking SB at the times we need it the most. Deploying the SB into ETH seems to increase centralization of the protocol. There may be some clever ways to do this in a more decentralized manner, but I see at least a slight reduction of decentralization. With this comes increased need for bandwith.  Even so, with the size of our SB and inflation well above 5% we should investigate if there is a way to make sure we at least don\u2019t lose value so I support an investigation but remain sceptical until I see a suggestion for implementation. Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee Voted: Yes Reasoning: It\u2019s good to see a suggestion that actually starts to generate some revenue from our L2 work. In my view Maker delivers a superior product to our competitors and can thus gain market share despite pricing ourselves equally to our competitors. I also think that it will be a much easier task to remove the cost later in case we need to aggressively gain market share rather than take the reputational hit of putting a price on something that was launched as free.

When you can achieve what the proposal set out to do without going through engineering and governance effort I think it is prudent to go with the simpler solution. In this case it would be perfectly fine to borrow DAI against ETH collateral either through a regular vault or with more effort an institutional vault. The proposal as it stands presents Maker with more risk and more complexity for equivalent revenue. In addition there will be opportunity costs by implementing this over other projects. I don\u2019t see what we would possibly discover after greenlight that would improve the proposal significantly enough to be worth the effort. ",

Sometimes you have to touch ground and realize that something isn\u2019t working out. Sadly that is the case of these vaults where demand simply haven\u2019t materialized. The methodology is similar on all vaults so I approve the start of the offboarding process. Going off my principle of maintaining obligations, I\u2019m happy we got a routine in place following the lessons learned from offboarding Aave. As a consequence I want to stress the paramount importance of clear communication of our intentions to go through with this offboarding in as many different channels as possible. Users need and deserve a warning in advance. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: This votes marks a break my recent trend of voting against the recommendation of the MOMC. The bear market is here and with it a serious unwinding of all types of vaults. The changes suggested are for the large part minor, but one new concept is the signaling of freezing stability fees until September 1st. Given the recent turbulence in crypto and in particular stablecoins lately showing stability can help improve Maker\u2019s market position. With the massive unwinding of vaults any increase in rates will also have a limited impact on short term revenue. Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c7-SP2 - Modify Oracle Data Models Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal changes the Oravle Data Models to more accurately reflect current conditions. As we rely on the data provided from our Oracles these are welcome changes. Periodic reviews of these models comes with the territory of having them. Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c19-SP1 - Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal reduces the overall cost of our Oracles without causing a undue increase in risk.

This is an issue that has the community divided, but this initiative might provide us with a working compromise. It is also a good chance to test DSSKiln. In my opinion the most important part of burning is showing dedication to the promise of a return of capital to MKR holders. It is integral to the idea of a self running permissionless protocol. Once we put humans into the mix it suddenly becomes a question of trust. Do we trust promises that the burn will ever be put back on? I recently saw a new community member ask about how revenue was beneficial to Maker holders and the answer given, from a CU member, was that there is a buyback and burn system. Here lies the pitch, the story, the promise that not only is Maker burning, but it will keep burning so you will never have to trust a human to buy your MKR from you. Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT Voted: Yes Reasoning: We got these tokens through an airdrop and needed to find a way to make use of them. I\u2019m a little concerned about the added governance overhead, but think we can prioritize if needed. Add rETH as a new Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: This was a decision I had to reconsider. Initially I voted no because we really need to focus our efforts and we have a long backlog. This particular proposal would also get less workload if we could wait until after the merge. Ideally I would have had a \u201cYes, but later\u201d option. After getting more reassurances from the community that the workload was less than I initially anticipated I flipped from a weak \u201cno\u201d to a weak \u201cyes\u201d. Given the expected revenue, small debt ceiling and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding sETH I still think we should\u2019t put this at the top of our priority, but I do think it will have potential going forward.

Saying no to the onboarding of a facilitator is painful because I know very well the personal courage and sacrifice one puts in to be weighted by the community. Being a facilitator is a privilege and a great responsibility and we owe it to the community that the ones we appoint have the best possibilities in becoming successes both for themselves and the community. Being a facilitator involves management duties, it involves working with and interacting with other core units, delegates, and other stakeholders. A critical skill in that regard is managing expectations of counterparts. Knowing when to push ahead and when to defer and making sure the team shines and not just individual contributors.

I hope to see him help DIN evolve into an even better provider of relevant insight for the community as a whole and for CUs in particular. Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) Voted: No Reasoning: The week prior to the deadline for voting on I was on vacation and thus I did not cast my vote until late. It\u2019s been one that I have been weighing back and forth for a long time. RWA has been a passion of mine ever since becoming actively involved in the community. My first exposure to LOVE was reading the Sandbox Project at 30.000 feet over Europe on my way to Christmas Holiday last year. Since then, I\u2019ve been watching RWA grow slowly (some might say too slowly) but steadily. Crossing the boundary between TradFi and DeFi carries a lot of work pushing boundaries and it carries risks. Both known and unknown risks. We also operate largely in an unregulated space. With so much capital at stake there is a lot of incentives for actors to act dishonourably, especially so when there is limited legal recourse. It therefore seems prudent to add an additional layer of control to the RWA lending process. The Core Unit cannot be seen in a vacuum, however. A phrase that has been repeated during the discussions have been \u201creview the proposal on its merits\u201d. The process surrounding a proposal and the intentions of the backers of a proposal is part of the merit. I think it is easy to forget that MakerDAO is not a traditional company. There are many checks and balances that we take for granted because we\u2019re so used to operating in a traditional organization. Maker lacks a lot of tools to ensure obedience that is present in most organizations. Firstly, the only real method of sanction Maker has against a CU is the discontinuation of funding. This means that trust plays a much larger role in MakerDAO that one would assume at first glance. Having established that trust in a DAO is already at a premium, it becomes even more paramount when we consider a control function. When an oversight function approves something, it can be because they have done their due diligence, and everything is where it is supposed to be. However, it is also possible that they are not sharing negative findings because they have been incentivised somehow not to. As double checking all the work done by a CU would essentially render them redundant a certain level of trust must exist between the oversight function and the ones employing said function. Having a control function beholden to a subgroup of voting actors casts doubts about the motives of said subgroup. Maybe they are merely concerned MKR holders that wants additional oversight over risky business processes. But it is also possible they have interests they know wouldn\u2019t otherwise be approved by the protocol unless they can exert influence over the oversight. It is also worth taking into consideration that if the process is compromised and funds are lost there are very limited legal recourse to amend the situation. When we add to this the endgame plan and an expressed desire to move away from complex RWA my votes went on no. An oversight CU I can\u2019t fully trust doesn\u2019t have any value. Ratification Poll for Task Forces (MIP75) Voted: No Reasoning: Whenever there exists a power vacuum something or someone will eventually attempt to fill it. Operating and organizing as a DAO is a novel concept and it can be frustrating depending on where in the organization a member might be. It also presents issues to counterparties that are used to dealing with hierarchy and where given individuals are mandated to act and commit the entirety of the organization. Maker does not have an executive level that traditional organizations have, and which would deal with day-to-day coordination and prioritization. As such it is understandable that dealing with approval from MKR holders and having constraints on how quickly it is possible to act that an initiative like this would show up. Even less surprising that it comes from the Core Units which are the ones feeling this need daily. While I recognize the need for the need of MKR holders to clearly state their long-term objectives and priorities it should still be the domain of MKR holders and not left in the hands of the CUs. MKR holders should deal with the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d and CUs should primarily deal with \u201chow\u201d. To pull a parallel to politics. In a representative government you have a civil service that provides the expertise on various fields but ultimately puts into action the ideas and aspirations set forth by the people represented through politicians. In a similar vein. CUs should put into action the vision, objectives and aspirations expressed my MKR holders. Even with limitations on scope and time, this framework seems to sacrifice too much MKR input in the name of efficiency. This is similarly to let the government run itself without input from elected politicians. Thus, I do not support this proposal. Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) Voted: No Reasoning: The notion of putting existing capital to work gaining revenue is something that aligns very well with my core value of growing the profitability of the protocol it is in this instance in conflict with the values of maintaining obligations and simplicity. For the past year the surplus buffer has been a tiny fraction of the capital in vaults. In fact, last fall there was serious concern that the buffer was way too small when it was down to 1%. Today it is at an all time high of 7,2%. In the same period the size of our vaults has contracted immensely. In isolation this speaks in favour of exposing the buffer for added risk to increase revenue. I have two main arguments of going against. Firstly, even though we are now more comfortably able to cover possible bad debt, we have an added obligation of ongoing expenses to contributors in the protocol. With such reduced revenues it is highly likely we will have to be operation cash negative for an unknown amount of time. As such we must expect the surplus buffer to shrink. Should the markets turn, it will also take time for stability fees to build up enough levels to sustain a new high level of vaults. My second main argument is one of simplicity. By investing parts of the surplus buffer, we are implicitly claiming that the protocol is superior at investing than the MKR holder. If we distributed the capital to the MKR holder, they could then allocate it to whatever risk/reward profile or investment that makes sense to their individual portfolio. We already have a mechanism for this in the burn mechanic and we are also testing out another one with DSS Kiln. Lastly there is the concern about counterparty and centralization risk. This proposal would put a considerable amount of funds under control of a limited number of people in a multisig. There are vectors of attack against this that is hard to eliminate completely. Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal formalizes the changes to the schedule for deployment of the executive that has been on trial for the past few weeks. The change allows for a little more testing and adds workdays immediately following a new executive. Overall, a change with some upside and little downside. Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We launched a trial of this MIP to resurrect the burn. This MIP sets a framework for the use of the DSS Kiln to conduct permissionless open market operations. The most immediate is to acquire MKR for DAI from the surplus buffer more efficiently than current flapper auctions. While I can see the argument that having this capacity can incentivize its use in other areas, I believe governance capable of showing restraint and implement whatever direction the community wishes the protocol to go. Having a framework in place reduces the chance of ad-hoc proposals introducing unintended risks. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) Voted:  Approve existing budget only (business as usual) Reject Budget  Reasoning: With the recent downturn in revenue, it has become imperative to increase fiscal discipline. A natural first step is to restrict a further increase in our current expenses. Cutting expenses is a much more painful process than not taking them on in the first place. Avoiding increases until we can get a holistic view of total expenses is a prudent and cautious step. Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal adds a compensation budget for the Keep3r Network. Incentives makes actors do what we want them to. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) Voted:  Approve existing budget only (BrandlessGrowth) Reject budget  Reasoning: With the recent downturn in revenue, it has become imperative to increase fiscal discipline. A natural first step is to restrict a further increase in our current expenses. A bear market presents opportunity as well so we should be prepared to deploy resources if there is a fair chance of turning a profit. One area I think we\u2019re woefully unequipped is within marketing. Even so I find it hard to accept that it is not possible to prioritize budgets internally in the Growth CU to realise the Brand CU. Looking to SES they even proposed reducing their own budget to sustain LOVE getting realized. I think it is better to keep a strategic reserve for great opportunities that might present themselves.  The bear market must go on for some time to shake out the most vulnerable actors in the markets before I expect such opportunities will present themselves. ",

Delving into it I will answer on my own behalf since I think Doo and Rune should answer concerning their own thoughts and motivations if they are so inclined. My journey as a delegate started back in November last year. If you check my delegate platform you can see that it is the same as it was when I started. My voting history and reasoning for voting is also open for anyone to go through and examine. Doing so I\u2019m certain you will find that I\u2019ve stuck to my core values throughout and I have no intention of changing that anytime soon. Some decisions are easier to make because one side has a clearly stronger case and others are much harder because the arguments on both sides are compelling. You may be aware that for some time Rune has been working on his endgame plan and in May he started to involve the community to a larger extent. I followed the presentations he\u2019s given and after weighing the proposed solution I find that I\u2019m in agreement with the overall direction of the plan. As such I have publicly supported it. So does this mean I\u2019ve given up my own assessments and values? It is my clear impression that the intention of the endgame plan is to have competing views within it. My intention is to do my part to make it the best it can be for the whole of MakerDAO. I do not intend to hide my affiliation with the end-game plan but rather communicate openly as I have done so far. Any delegate serves at the mercy of their delegator. That is as true for me as it is for any other. But that MKR was delegated in the first place because the delegate acted and voted in a way that inspired confidence and trust that they would make good decisions. Thus it is reasonable to assume that any delegator would want that same behaviour to continue. So far as a delegate I have yet to be approaced by a delegator and asked to vote in a certain way. On the other hand I have been approaced by members of CUs and asked to vote in a certain way.     MakerWOW:  Thank you for your time/consideration.

It makes me even more happy to have a newcomer excited enough to deep dive into the forums. I also share your hope that Maker manages to rally more token holders into governance. In my belief we get the best decisions when more voices add to the discussion. Hopefully this answers your questions and if not just let me know and I\u2019ll try to elaborate and clarify. ",

This proposal promises steps in the right direction for both. This will shift some of our counterparty risk away from USDC. My initial stance was to go 100% for US Treasuries due to the lower risk involved. However, we should not get into a position where we trade one dominant counterpary risk for another. As such it is important that we get exposure to and experience with other entities. Gaining experience with Baillie Gifford will allow us to expand in that direction later. Another reason to accept a little elevated risk is the chance to align more with the clean money initiative. I have high hopes for this proposal. May it come into fruition soon. ",

This proposal also allows us to diversify our counter-party risk. I\u2019m excited to see this progress. While it carries other risks, as well as unknown unknowns as this has note been done before, I think they are reasonably minimized. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes It feels good to be friends with MOMC again. I agree with their proposals. Sad to see that Aave D3M keeps being dormant, but at this point it is market considerations. I hope that for the next meeting we will see a discussion surrounding MANA and whether ETH-C vaults can be increased somewhat in SF. There seems to be an ongoing trend where funds get shuffled over to ETH-C for the lower fees and only get put into -A and -B when the market turns down. Select a Target Level of rNPI Profitability to Guide Budget Cuts Voted: 1. Positive (Greather than 5%) 2. Break-even (Plus-minus 5%) Reasoning: The protocol faces several existential threats. One that is looming right now is the slow strangulation unless we manage to balance our revenues and expenses. It is my opinion that there have been a lack of overarching objectives and vision for MakerDAO and as such I think a poll such as this that gives guidance on what to aim for in a comprehensive plan to evaluate expenses seems prudent. I fully expect turning this goal into specific cuts is going to be hard however. My first vote was to keep a profit going. This is directly stated as one of my core values as a delegate. In saying so, I also recognize that doing that with cuts along right now is probably too much to ask. That would entail reducing our expenses by more than 50% and that is going to break our DAO I fear. Luckily we have some projects underway that I expect are going to raise our revenues so the necessary cuts will be more in the order of 20%. Still a significant cut, but one that should be possible to go through with. ",

The establishment of this vault signals a bridging of a gap between a large TradFi organization and a DeFi protocol. Two very different organizations from to similar yet very different worlds. Progress tends to come in small steps and sometimes we don\u2019t realize how far we\u2019ve come until we look at the tracks going back from where we came from. This vault should open doors, not only for Maker but also for the wider DeFi space. To remain grounded this vault is still a proof of concept, it has a SF of 0%.

That way we can enact the positive change we want to see, including realizing the clean money vision. In order to make use of non-crypto native assets they need to somehow get tokenized and made available. The work of \u201ctranslating\u201d RWA into something manageable is a complex and demanding task. It is one I think Maker is better off letting other entities handle to avoid growing to complex to govern as a DAO. As such I have high hopes this proposal can help pave the road for others of the same type for Maker to interact with. Bonds are a good place to expand into and also fits with the endgame plan. Keeping in mind that this is a greenlight poll and there are many potential pitfalls before this becomes productive I still think the potential here warrants the use of resources to investigate. ",

While I doubt changing stability fees by 25 basis points are going to have perceptible effect on vault usage, we are now at such low revenue levels that it doesn\u2019t really cost much to try. Honestly I think at this point marketing would have a lot more impact. Crossing my fingers the markets will turn and our revenue and vault usage will increase. Maker Teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters\u00a8 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Deploying on L2\u2019s has been a focus of the protocol for a while now. It is nice to see us getting closer to the finishing line. I\u2019m a little disapointed to see the initial parameters set for a 0 bps, when it was previously agreed to be put at 1, but at least there is a process that should be able to correct for this prior to actual launch. While any innovative work carries risk I think the limited debt ceiling we have chosen keeps the risk at acceptable levels. That being said we should work to improve security and lessen risk as we have done on numerous other occasions. Maker has a solid reputation. Let\u2019s keep building on that. Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments Voted: Yes Reasoning: Reducing budgets are never easy. It creates an atmosphere of uncertainty. Contributors naturally will worry about what comes next. At the same time it concerns the survival of the whole. Failure to address the issue will only worsen the problem ultimately leading to a worse situation for more contributors. On the question on whether going for a broad cut or a more targeted approach I was conflicted. A broad cut would presumably mean a quicker process which would be a boon. At the same time different CUs got onboarded in different economic circumstances and it is reasonable to review them holistically. In the end I landed on supporting a targeted approach because it allows the different CUs to have a more involved role in the process and gives us a greater security of not inadvertently underfunding a critical function. My wish is for us to get this process over with as soon as we can so we can turn our attention on focus on the future and the possibilities that lies there. ",

As far as I\u2019m aware there hasn\u2019t been a vote to revoke this initiative. It is broad and allows for wide interpretation of what it actually means. Even so the deals we have been closing lately would be hard pressed to fit into the concept of clean money. This proposal however seems to me to fit into the vision of clean money. It is also a greenlight poll and as such the bar should be relatively low. Backing this particular proposal could lead to investments that would help combat climate change. With increasing regulatory pressure, being tied in to positive real world change will also serve to improve our standing in relation to regulators. As such I think we should at least give it a closer examination. That being said, there is rarely a deal that is flawless and I do see several areas of concern with the proposal as presented. Two of the major ones are:   Duration. While it is flattering that Maker is deemed a reliable partner enough that a 14 year facility is sough, it is the longest duration of any asset we\u2019ve been involved with by a long shot. This might not be a complete showstopper, but it needs to be addressed. Especially in relation to secondary markets and how to handle a default scenario. From the preliminary assessments that seems to mean we\u2019re limited to the size of the surplus buffer.  Risk adjusted yields. While I think the clean money vision entails a willingness to give up some financial gain for a given risk level, my view is that Maker should at least be compensated at the level of comparable treasury bonds. As it stands Maker would have to take on elevated risk to receive less than 10-year treasury bonds. This would need to be addressed before I would vote in favor after a more thorough investigation.  Overall I fear that closer examination will reach the conclusion that this proposal is not fitting for Maker at the current time, but if we defer our vision at every opportunity it\u2019s not much of a vision. The debate on this proposal was also long and thorough and revealed a lack of examination to make a final call. While I also recognize that the current state of the RWA CU is not the best I believe this state of affairs to be temporary. Whether this means a reformed CU, some other arrangement or a new meta-DAO remains to be seen. ",

Any of the proposed spend levels constitutes a bellow break even spend level going by the forecast provided by strategic finance. Prior to the uncertainty introduced with the RWA CU I would have had a higher estimate on the income from RWA. As it is view the estimate as being probable. Given the current size of our surpluss buffer, I think we can spending some without causing unacceptable risk. Lower cuts are easier to handle and causes less disruption. A bear market also afords an opportunity to gather talent so we don\u2019t want to make the cuts too deep. Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR) Voted: Yes Reasoning: A major concern for me with the current state of RWA is ensuring business continuity. This proposal allows for CES to pick up some of the pieces left in the wake of the sudden drop in activity from RWA. Even though this authorizes funds within CES\u2019 own budget I think we should divert some funding from RWA-001 to the various initiatives needed to handle ongoing obligations.

Even so in my mind the superbear scenario cuts too deep, and maintaining our intellectual property rights is an ongoing obligation that we should not take lightly. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Streamlining and codifying the offboarding process was revealed to be important as far back as when Content production got off-boarded. Happy to see further refinement to this work. Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) Voted: 1. Approve proposed budget (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months) 2. Approve existing budget (Business as usual) Reasoning: In a bear market it is helpful when everyone pitches in and takes responsibility. Oracles were early in proposing voluntary cuts in exchange for guarantees to avoid further cuts for the coming 12 months. Stability is also important to give core units peace to focus on their tasks. As such I find this option to be the optimal compromise. Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Housekeeping proposal to clear up the language in the MIP50 making it universal. Clarity helps promote simplicity. Easy to support. Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is the second attempt at this proposal. The previous time around my two main concerns were volatility in the proposed assets and the manual nature of deployment of capital. This proposal addresses most of my concerns. At least enough to give it an attempt that we can evaluate. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I did not support the onboarding of this core unit because I think it is a poor strategic fit. That position has not changed. To me this is a subset of marketing that needs to fit into a marketing strategy which we do not currently have. Even so I\u2019m reluctant to offboard in the middle of an active budget cycle because it is disruptive, obviously to the core unit in question, but also to other core units. As such I refrain from proposing offboardings unless there is clear risk to the protocol or the costs incurred is substantial. Once a proposal is presented however that uncertainty is already introduced. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC Voted: No Reasoning: In the current transition period and with a lack of a functioning RWA team for the short term, I think it creates false expectations to greenlight this application at the current time. Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) Voted: No Reasoning:  In the current transition period and with a lack of a functioning RWA team for the short term, I think it creates false expectations to greenlight this application at the current time. Executive 31st of August 2022. HVBank Drawdown, Maker Teleport Launch on Optimism and Arbitrum Voted: Yes Reasoning: Nothing objectionable in this executive. Happy to see HVBank finalized as well as the launch of Teleport on Optimism and Arbitrum. Fingers crossed for smooth sailing. Polls ending 1st of September 2022. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: 1. Option 1 2. Option 2 Reasoning: Another open market committee another reduction in stability fees. This proposal gives the option between minor cuts and moderate cuts in an effort to increase vault usage. Previously there have been little visible correlation between rate and usage, but there might be signs this is turning. Personally I think it is too early to try the heavier cuts in fees. I would much rather see us try to reduce CRs first. Maker is different from other lending providers that we can provide much greater liquidity than others without affecting fees. As such I expect the players utilizing Maker to be more incentivized by lower CRs than slightly lower fees. And as always macro considerations reigns supreme, so regardless of our actions the main driver will be the markets belief in the value of leveraged collateral. Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) Voted: Yes Reasoning: With the sudden reduction in output from our RWA core unit a need for business continuation has been created. I have previously supported CES in continuing some of the work and this is a request to carry on other aspects of the work. Maintaining our obligations is a key virtue to me as a delegate and thus I support this proposal. My natural expectation is that this is going to be covered by a similar reduction in the RWA-001 budget. ",

Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is another proposal in response to the failure of RWA-001 to deliver on their mandate. This particular one provides funding for legal work being carried out by Christian Pedersen and done under the umbrella of the Strategic Finance core unit. Immediate business continuity must be preserved while we organize a long term solution to how we treat real world assets. Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another proposal in response to the failure of RWA-001 to deliver on their mandate. This particular amends wording in MIP-65 so that it no longer requires the certification of the RWA-001 facilitator. A sensible course of action since at the present time it seems unlikely that RWA-001 will resume operations. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members Voted: No Reasoning: This one was difficult. Maintaining obligations is a core value of mine. Rewarding contributors according to agreements are important to me. In this case however, the contributors in question does not meet the criteria for payment according to the agreement. There are valid arguments why it would be possible to make an exception. I made a post explaining more in detail here. In the end I came down in favour of preserving the cliff as a concept. A precedent here will open the floodgates. An almost immediate example before this proposal has even passed can be seen here. Updating HVBank (RWA-009) Legal Agreements Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal updates the legal agreements with HVBank. There are numerous changes but the majority clarifies and specifies more detailed some of terms and conditions of the agreement the most important being the scope and types of loans being acceptable. This will remove any confusion as to what the agreement is actually about since some of these terms were not clearly stated before. Executive 7th of September 2022 Core Unit MKR Vesting, Recognized Delegate Compensation, MOMC Parameter Changes Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another executive. This one contains CU MKR vesting, MOMC parameter changes and delegate compensation. My fingers are crossed changed MOMC parameters results in increased vault usage. We could really need it at this point given that our revenue from vaults are at their lowest point in 2 years. ",

Enacting accepted proposals are required to continuously improve the protocol. No immediate dangers, even if it got a little delayed due to waiting for final confirmation on the validity of the spell. Polls ending 19th of September 2022 Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI Voted: No Reasoning: I went back and forth on this one, but ultimately ended on \u201cno\u201d because I don\u2019t think the expenditure of resources on this proposal is worth it at the current time. The liquidity is limited and while I think this proposal might have merit in a more medium term I think we are better served by focusing our resources elsewhere in the short term. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) Voted: No Reasoning: Reviewing this proposal in light of the assessment given by risk and the estimated revenue this proposal seems to be too risk heavy for the rewards offered. I don\u2019t think this is likely to change withing a reasonable time frame. As such we are better served examining other collateral. Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The mint promised in this proposal is substantial. We do need to examine more new on chain collateral to diversify our risk and to avoid stagnation. Even with a stricter expectation for success my assessment is that this particular collateral is worth investigating further. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending on the 26th of September 2022 Ratification Poll for Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP24) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I came very close to voting \u201cAbstain\u201d since this MIP very easily falls into a conflict of interest as a delegate. In the end I came down on supporting because it provides a more timely response to a delegate failing to meet the duties required. With the current way we track performance metrics a delegate could build a perfect record and then stop all voting and communication for over a month and still receive compensation. Shortening the measured period reduces the potential time for a free ride. Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Due to the extremely obvious conflict of interest of deciding on your own compensation I abstained this vote as I have done in other votes concerning delegate compensation. I really wish there was a functioning alternative to deciding questions related to delegate functions or compensation. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) Voted: No Reasoning: I want to start this by saying I do think StarkNet deserves MKR compensation in the current compensation environment and I could very well support an alternative proposal. There are several reasons why I\u2019m opposed to this particular proposal. Firstly I think the overall compensation is very high, in fact it slightly exceeds that of Protocol Engineering (249/FTE vs 270/FTE), this is despite StarkNet currently holding a more limited scope of responsibility and also a significant smaller impact on the health of the protocol. Secondly I do not agree to starting the cliff period at the inception of the Core Unit. The whole point of the cliff is to ensure aligned incentives and a shared concern for risk to the protocol. This is significantly diminished by almost eliminating the whole of the cliff period. Thirdly I think that we need to examine MKR vests in general. Of the distributed MKR a dissapointingly low portion have been kept by contributors, meaning it would make sense to look at alternative forms for compensation that do not negatively impact existing MKR token holders value. Since we need to honor existing commitments I think it is prudent to be extra careful to enter into new agreements that we will have to honor for years to come. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I belive in the idea of banking the bankless. The major areas to do so does not neccesarily use English as their primary language. Recent events have shown a growing support for crypto in South America and especially in Argentina. To help make us more accessible I think the ambassador program is a good step. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) Voted:  150% 100%  Reasoning: While my general apprehension against MKR vesting in its current form also applies to this proposal, in the end I reach the opposite conclusion. This proposal has a much lower MKR/FTE, it is also previously approved through MKR governance meaning we have an obligation to see it through. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I do not think the Strategic Happiness Core unit is a good strategic fit for MakerDAO. I did not think this when it was first proposed and I have not changed my mind from seeing it in operation. With the downturn in revenue since its inception and thus the expenses it incurs be an ever growing proportion of those revenues it is also increasingly difficult to justify the level of spending. Adding marketing activities with no overall plan on what we attempt to achieve is also very unlikely to generate value in excess of expenses. I have seen the argument to delay approving this proposal due to another similar proposal coming up in the next governance cycle. In the final analysis there can be no certainty on the outcome of a hypothetical next proposal. As such I must vote the way I think best for the protocol on every proposal. And that to me is for SHCU and Maker to part ways. ",

Update rETH Onboarding Parameters Voted: Yes Reasoning: Given the time passed since this collateral was first proposed onboarded and the developmens that has happened it seems reasonable to update the parameters to more closely reflect actuality. Collateral Auction Parameter Updates Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal from Risk adjusts some of the auction parameters to better align to current conditions. The changes seems reasonable and it is to be expected that we need to adjust to changing market conditions. Poll ending 3rd of October 2022. Community Greenlight Poll - RFA (RFA - Canadian Federally Regulated Mortgage Originator) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I\u2019m generally reluctant to recommend any greenlight poll given the unfortunate state of our ability to handle them in the short term. Even so this specific proposal shows promise as well as a diversification compared to other onboarded collateral. Looking into the crystal ball I foresee this particular collateral being more suited to a metaDAO than to the core. Time and investigation will show where it ends up. ",

Happy to see that our Monetalis deal start to get traction in more traditional media too. This helps build both presence and legitimacy. If we are to succeed with broader adoption we cannot remain unknown to masses of people. Polls ending 6th of October 2022. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: This particular proposal have insignificant impact on our revenue but includes the tightening of one debt ceiling to reduce risk exposure. My default stance is to support our appointed committee and I don\u2019t find anything objectionable in this proposal. With the parameter guidance it should be noted that no increases in our major vaults are planned for the remainder of Q4. This means that we must expect our revenue from crypto collateral to be well under our running expenses. As such we must put further faith in RWA or other forms of generated revenue to keep us afloat until market conditions improve. This must be part of our overall picture even as we presumably start to implement the endgame plan. Especially as we stay in pigeon stance the importance of RWA in the short term remain substantial and needs support going forward. The alternative is to slowly bleed surplus buffer and maybe survive. Approve Multisig for Management of Velodrome NFT Voted: Yes Reasoning: In any governance process we need to strike a balance between efficiency and security. Any multisig carries a risk for abuse. The greater value that can be extracted with the particular sig, the greater this risk becomes. Looking at the overall value involved and the reputation risk and financial incentives for the potential signers the overall assessment comes down on \u201capprove\u201d for this particular proposal. That being said, any of our multisigs should be routinely reviewed to ensure the risk/reward equation have not meaningfully been altered since approval. Poll ending 17th of October 2022 Community Greenlight Poll - ANCHORAGE (Anchorage Lending Crypto Mining) Voted: No Reasoning: While the lack of a functioning RWA team doesn\u2019t mean I categorically vote against any greenlight proposal it does mean my bar for approving is significantly higher than it otherwise would be. This particular proposal carries a high degree of necessary due diligence. As such I do not think it is a good strategic fit for Maker at this time. ",

I think the future of DeFi entails collaberation and maintaining and expanding our relationships will make us stronger going forward. Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters Voted: Yes Reasoning: While I\u2019m uncertain this will increase our revenue in a meaningful way, at least it is worth the attempt. Diversifying our stablecoin exposure from an overwhelming portion of USDC this is also a step in the right direction though it exposes us to some of the same kinds of problems just from a different actor. Going a bit back and forth I ended up on at slight yes. Best to monitor the development and then reassess. End DAI Funding For Sourcecred Voted: Yes Reasoning: This one was hard to approve. I wrote a line of argument against this proposal here. Even so I think in the final analysis the overall cost to GovAlpha (not just financial, but also workload) the benefits are just too minor. Hopefully a replacement system that can reward contributors starting out can be found. MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations Voted: Yes Reasoning: I concur with the analysis presented that the additional risks a user is exposed to on Aave and Compound justifies a higher reward for using them. As such I also agree that it is reasonable to exclude those rewards in our calculations. MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee Voted: 0,5% (0%) Reasoning: Assuming a change to the previous poll is passed which seems highly likely it makes sense to adjust the spread to account for the change. A spread of 0,5% seems to provide a good balance between exposure and revenue. Furthermore it keeps the total exposure closer to our current surplus buffer. Executive 14th of October Collateral Auction Parameter Changes, MOMC Parameter Adjustments, Recognized Delegate Compensation for September Voted: Yes Reasoning: As usual I supported the current executive.

                    "content": "Polls ending 24th of October 2022 Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set Voted: Yes Reasoning: Finally the big moment. Even before I attended the first DVC back in May it was clear that reform was needed at MakerDAO. The scope and complexity had grown substantially and was already making governance and oversight hard to manage. Since then the endgame plan has evolved. From my personal perspective I think this plan provides a foundation and a direction upon which to build. The devil will continue to be in the details and much must be done before even the first parts of this plan will bear fruits. I\u2019m particularly hopeful that changes to the front end of governance and the gamefication and staking rewards will succeed in bringing in more smaller MKR holders and creating a lasting interest in Maker governance. At the same time, I fear the tokenomics is the weakest link in this plan so far. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I\u2019ve been an opponent of the SH core unit since its inception. The strategic fit was bad due to a lack of coordination of marketing efforts, and the downturn in revenue has made the expenditure even more ill advised. Even in sync with other marketing effort it does not make any sense as its own core unit. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) Voted: Yes Reasoning: My reasoning today is the same as it has been since the first vote. I do not think we should add marketing efforts piecemeal and without a solid set of objectives what we are trying to achieve and as part of an overall marketing strategy. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) Voted: Yes Reasoning: I\u2019m sad to see RWF go as it was a pioneer in Maker history. However it is a necessary step on the road to changing how we approach real world assets. To me real world assets provides a crucial link that is required if Maker is truly going to make a difference in the world. Regardless whether the goal is the clean money vision or if it is to bring banking to the bankless we must somehow pierce the veil between crypto and real world goods and services. Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Maker is in a dangerous situation where we need to grow out revenues. One fairly untapped source is putting our balance sheet to work. This provides an opportunity to do so. Although the proposal carries risks, it is my belief that technical solutions can mitigate the most serious ones. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another proposal to put our balance sheet to work. I\u2019m happy we are taking our time implementing these and making sure we don\u2019t stumble on the execution. Loss of our capital should be our primary concern at this stage, even tough I\u2019m confident we can make it work. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) Voted: Yes Reasoning: An easy proposal to support. We want to examine this collateral and we can\u2019t do that without the resources necessary. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) Voted: Yes Reasoning: With the sweeping changes that are coming up on the protocol this amendment might become redunant but even so I think it constitutes an improvement over what we have today so I support it. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Given that I was co-author on this proposal it would be strange not to support it. In order to proceed with the new approach to real world assets we need to clear out old mandates and actors. Executive 26th of October 2022 rETH Technical Onboarding, Enable Starknet DAI Bridge Fees Voted: Yes Reaoning: Supported this weeks proposal as ususal. Poll ending 27th of October 2022 MIP65 Asset Reallocation Voted: Yes Reasoning: A sensible proposal that lowers the risk while maintaining the majority of the revenue. As I wrote earlier our main concern should be to preserve the capital employed and that means low risk and in all likelihood low yield. ",

Changes must be enacted to make a difference. Polls ending 3rd of November 2022 Activate Liquidations for Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt Voted: Yes Reasoning: The vaults in questions predates the PSM. The way our system is now set up these vaults are accruing stability fees that is in excess of what we will be able to claim for them. Liquidating these vaults will seemingly incur losses, but it is mostly a question of setting the record straight. With all the recent proposals for utilization of the PSM moving some additional USDC there doesn\u2019t seem to be the worst idea. One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit Voted: No Reasoning: When a decision is made to offboard a core unit we cannot in good conscience keep extending the lenght of the offboarding. This particular core unit has already gotten extended once to be able to cover Bogota and have been given a generous severance package. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: Supported the proposal from the open market committee. Minor changes this time. With rates rapidly rising in traditional finance I expect to see some contagion into DeFi as time marches on. Still the majority of lending demand seems to originate in expectation of rising asset prices so we will probably not see substantial increases until the next bull cycle. Until then we will have to make do. ",

                    "content": "Executive 9th of November 2022 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Another week another executive needed to enact approved changes. Nothing immediately damaging here so supported. Poll ending 10th of November 2022 Add the Compound V2 DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Activating the Compound Direct Deposit Module will lead to some badly needed revenue for the protocol. As a risk mitigating measure the debt ceiling will start off low and increase with time. Any issues should be dealt with as early as possible to keep the capital at risk low. In order to scale we need to minimize the amount of human input and this provides another automated solution. Urgent Executive 12th of November 2022 Urgent Collateral Parameter Changes Voted: Yes Reasoning: This urgent executive follows an urgent signal request to sharply change the parameters of the MANA vault in order to encourage discontinuation of its use. The intention is to protect the protocol from bad debt as the risk assessment has rapidly deteriorated. This is very sensible from a risk management perspective in isolation. It has been known for some time that MANA has been an asset with high slippage. However I think we need to consider other aspects and learn from this going forward. It is clear that it is Maker\u2019s right to change parameters according to changing market conditions. However we do need to be mindful about the impact of those changes on our users and how well we can communicate with those users. Even though we have the right to change the parameters the rate and magnitude of that change cannot be infinite. I don\u2019t think anyone would accept if we overnight increased SF to 1.000.000%. Similarly a change to liquidation penalty to 100% would be unreasonable. As such we should put a limit to the potential magnitude and rate of change of our parameters to give a certain amount of predictability to our users. The less communication we have with the end user the lower the rate of change should be. These considerations should go into the work MOMC does. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 24th of November 2022 Add GNO (GnosisDAO) as a new Vault Type Voted: Yes Reasoning: Adding GNO as a new Vault type carries a risk. There is limited liquidity other risk factors covered in the risk analysis. As a whole they don\u2019t seem overly risky. With the way the markets are shaking out and the looming crypto winter I believe it is important to forge alliances. No one protocol can do all the work alone. In the specific case of Gnosis we also have an agreement with them. In order to maintain a reputation as a reliable partner I think the agreement weighs more heavily than the slightly elevated risk. Thus I support this proposal. Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal seeks to onboard senior secured debt using DAI. The estimated yield is at 4%. Maker is still in a precarious situation when it comes to revenue compared to expenses. This proposal would mean we can shift the balance somewhat at the same time as we get to diversify our exposure. Given the type of assets being proposed the risk should be manageable. We need to start to monitor our USDC reserves as we are getting more proposals for its use than we can realistically employ. The relatively low debt ceiling on this proposal compared to others while giving us a chance to build relations as well as gain experience seems to me to be an overall valuable package. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A Voted: Yes Reasoning: Given the recent events, offboarding renBTC seems the prudent measure. Maker has already closed the possibility of taking on more debt to this collateral. These further changes to parameters will assist in closing down existing positions. Sad that we need to. Hopefully better times will come. Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This poll asks for sentiment for expending work to assess the viability of onboarding another highly rated bond asset. This type of collateral seems to be the best fit to diversify our PSM exposure until we can get negotiated revenue sharing arrangements with PSM partners. In this environment of medium and rising rates this is likely to generate a meaningful yield for Maker as well. At the very least it is worth investigating. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 28th of November 2022. Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) Voted: No Reasoning: With the approval of the framework for the endgame plan it is time to start to pivot the organization toward this new direction. That means we have to shape existing core units into the scopes, metaDAOs and ecosystem actors. In my view Immunify represents a clear ecosystem actor. As such it should use the remaining budget to reorganize and seek funding through other parts of the organization. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) Voted: 1. Approve Reduced budget - New Base 2. Approve existing budget only Reasoning: Again the change of strategic direction towards the endgame necessitates changes to the current and future tasks. DUX will play a crucial role in building the new front-end that will be an integral part of the endgame. As such their workload is likely to increase or at the very least remain constant. In a project as complex as the endgame it would be very fortuitous if we do not run into any unforeseen issues and additional workforce can help mitigate delays. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal was a close \u201cno\u201d in my final estimation. There is a lot to like about it. It creates much needed revenue for Maker, it is in very solid financial products, and the team has made a good case for the proposal. Yet there are some factors that in the end turned this from a \u201cyes\u201d to a \u201cno\u201d for me. First, it goes against my core value of simplicity. Deploying the PSM needs to be done into very secure facilities. This proposal introduces a layer of management and thus complexity that goes against the notion of decentralization and automation. Secondly, Maker\u2019s PSM reserves have been substantially from earlier levels. Thus Maker also needs to factor in how much time it will take to be able to meet the obligations to repay USDC. Hopefully we can find a future more automated and decentralized solution to be able to get exposure to these types of yields. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) Voted: No Reasoning: While I can see the value proposition of this proposal I find it hard to reconcile with Maker\u2019s risk tolerance. The limited liquidity coupled with an active management strategy makes this a poor strategic fit for Maker in my evaluation. Unless there is a fairly major shift in sentiment I do not see that changing either. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) Voted: No Reasoning: As I do not see a future where Immunifi remains as a core unit I do not see any reason to modify the mandate. As an ecosystem actor Immunifi is free to determine their own and do not need any further approval from Maker. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) Voted: Reject Budget Reasoning: As previously argued, I believe the future of Immunify lies as an ecosystem actor in the endgame paradigm. By that logic it doesn\u2019t make sense to renew the current budget. The remaining funding should rather be used to pivot as quickly as possible. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) Voted: Reject Budget Reasoning: Evaluating the endgame plan there is unfortunately no room for a Gov-Coms core unit. Given that the budget is only six months and the time line for the end game plan is a year I was close to voting in favor of this budget proposal. In the end I believe it is in the overall interest of the protocol to enact these changes without delay and that Gov-Coms can transition into an ecosystem actor. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) Voted: Reject Budget Reasoning: With the change into the end-game plan I do not see Sidestream Auction Services continue as a core unit. As with numerous other core units the future lies as an ecosystem actor. In order to expedite the change it thus seems sensible not to renew the budget and lock in the core unit structure for another budget cycle. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) Voted: Reject Budget Reasoning: Tech Ops is another core unit that doesn\u2019t fit into the endgame plan in its current form. In many ways Tech Ops are already taken steps towards becoming an ecosystem actor and I think it is very possible to fund these kinds of services indirectly through MetaDAOs or the scopes. As with any transition there will be some friction but I believe a faster change will ultimately lead to less reduction in efficiency overall. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) Voted: No Reasoning: It is unclear to this delegate where the number 1BN is taken from. The last time the protocol added an arbitrary number to the ceiling of the surplus buffer of 250M it stayed. Until there is a more well argued reason for a given parameter I think it is prudent to refrain from setting one. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) Voted: No Reasoning: Monetalis has a track record of providing Maker with a steady stream of opportunities to limit our USDC counterparty exposure. This proposal seeks to do so by providing access to low risk real estate lending. While the risks remain low they are still in excess of what can be expected from high grade government bonds. Our tolerance for losses to bad debt remains very limited given the size of our surplus buffer and thus I think Maker should choose the safer path and refrain from this particular proposal. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) Voted: Yes Reasoning: While much of the same reasoning for MIP88 also holds water for MIP89, there is an agreed upon strategic direction with the clean money vision. It would thus seem that placements that are in support of that vision can endure somewhat worse terms than would otherwise be acceptable. In this particular case the risk is higher than it could otherwise have been for the same level of revenue. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) Voted: Approve speedy operations platform options budget Reasoning: SES has through this proposal put forth a plan for the transition of the core unit into a form compatible with the endgame plan. In order to minimize the transition period the budget requested for the fastest completion seems sensible. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 01st of December 2022 DAI Savings Rate Adjustment Voted: Leave the DSR unchanged at 0.01% Reasoning: In a world with continiously raising rates, even if the pace might be slowing, it is highly likely we\u2019ll see a harmonization between real life rates and rates offered in crypto. As such it is my belief that if Maker wants to retain the amount of DAI in circulation the Dai Savings Rate will have to increase. As such I believe the reasoning behind this proposal is sound. There are however two reasons to vote against it at the present time. Firstly, this is likely to provide another expense to the protocol. This expense will also come from assets on our balance sheet that haven\u2019t been proven to provide revenue at the present time. In particular this is the case for the various PSMs. While I do think it is very probable that these will provide a steady revenue stream I think it would be prudent to have seen a proven stream and to have had more time to avoid unknown unknowns. Secondly, even with a increase to 1% on the DRS I\u2019m unconvinced it will create too much of a positive impression amongst DAI users, but it will expose us to negative sentiment if we have to lower the rate again. This is also primarily a question of timing. My preferred solution would be to wait until January/February to consider such a change. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: The open market committee has once again delivered proposed changes. The changes proposed seems reasonable and in line with the strategic direction Maker is moving. As such I am supporting this proposal. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI Voted: Yes Reasoning: New Silver has been one of MakerDAOs longest running partners. It is good to see them being in a position where they wish to expand upon this partnership. A proven track record as a reliable partner should not be underestimated and should be valued even more in a world where we see various projects fail every month. Even so we should not blindly rely on trust and it therefore seems prudent to invest in additional risk and legal assessment before committing to providing a higher debt ceiling. Executive 02nd of December 2022 Compound D3M Onboarding, Activating Stablecoin Liquidations, Oracle Feed Whitelisting, Starknet Relay Upgrade, and MKR Vesting Voted: Yes Reasoning: Supported this weeks executive in order to enact previously agreed upon changes to the protocol.

Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll Voted: Neither Candidate Reasoning: First off, I would like to clarify that I think both candidates can do a good job for Maker so the voting is a little misleading. I voted that way because the vote didn\u2019t require an urgent resolution and at the time there were a few open questions. I\u2019m happy those have been answered and I\u2019m happy the community has made their choice. Best of luck to @Daimon-Law in his new role. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request Voted: Yes Reasoning: I voted against the past budget proposal for SAS-001.

It thus seems reasonable to me to grant this request in a transitional period to minimize friction. Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request Voted: Yes Reasoning: Same logic and reasoning as in the SAS proposal above. Ratification Poll for Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication (MIP55c3-SP11) Voted: No Reasoning: While this proposal presents a very interesting take and is very much in line with automating processes it does run into some difficulties of acceptance. The way Maker is structured there is a certain incumbent advantage when it comes to evaluate the merits of new ideas. This particular incumbent advantage will be lessened with the implementation of the endgame plan. In our current organizational setup I\u2019m inclined to follow the recommendations of the existing Risk CU. I would much rather this particular proposal be worked on in collaboration with them. Often, even great ideas, benefits from constructive debate. There is also something to be said for a proven track record. While existing risk models may not be perfect they have served us well in what can be described as a very volatile market, far in excess of what we have seen in more traditional markets. Over time I\u2019m certain we can tune our models to have more accurate parameters but until that time I think it pays to adopt a conservative stance and maintain stricter parameters than we might need.

                    "content": "Executive 11th of January 2023 Voted: Yes Reasoning: Supported this weeks executive as usual given that nothing malicious was detected during due diligence. Polls ending 12th of January 2023 Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall Voted: Yes Reasoning: Deciding on this took a fair while. Maker governance has approved a certain stream of MKR to cover for the incentive program for CES-001. As such it is my base view that any shortfall falls on CES-001 to cover. However this picture is complicated by the fact that those benefiting from the shortfall is no longer part of the CU and those being hurt by the shortfall is. I am also satisfied that avenues have been explored with regards to reclaiming the missing MKR. As an overall evaluation I\u2019m therefore reluctantly supporting this request. This requests shows very clearly that the current budgeting oversight is lacking. In particular when it comes to off boarding scenarios. This is not the first time funds have ended up with the wrong recipients. I believe the endgame will provide some solution to this but there will also be other more short term solutions that needs to be implemented to avoid similar issues going forward. Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln Voted: 1. 3 Million 2. 2 Million 3. 1 Million 4. 0,5 Million Reasoning: The burn has been a distant dream since early last year when a emergency executive raised the surplus buffer to 250 million with no reasoning behind it other than preventing further burn. Prior to that the size of the surplus buffer was a compromise between the need for a mechanism to let MKR holders take part in the protocols success and risk and capital buffer on the other hand. So a single vote to shut of the burn has lead to a whole series of votes to attempt to turn it back on. Several of these successful, yet not implemented. Thus having yet another one seems very superfluous, yet here we are. The arguments in favor of the burn has not disappeared and if anything the current low valuation of the token makes this a fantastic time to initiate such a burn. Sadly it seems this particular vote fails so I guess there will have to be another one followed by a confirmation one, followed by yet another confirming one 6 months after the first two has passed before we maybe implement it. This polls also shows the necessity of governance reform where passed governance proposals are actually implemented. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: Disclaimer of conflict of interest. I have personal vaults of StETH (Low fee). To address the conflict of interest first. I am happy to see the stability fee of this particular vault rise. Even so I believe the current levels are too low. It should as a minimum be ETH Low fee + a risk premium. As we have seen reducing the fee of this particular vault has mostly just shifted collateral out of other StEth. Time to fully end the sponsoring of this vault. I\u2019m very happy to see the tin of USDP increase a further 0.1% point. USDP has yet to engage with Maker in a revenue share program. With the increase in our DSR to 1% this particular PSM represents a net negative yield as well as constituting a counterparty risk. Unless some of these parameters changes I believe it is in Maker\u2019s interest to disincentivize its use. Overall I\u2019m happy with the changes and support the proposal. ",

                    "content": "Polls ending 19th of January 2023 Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling Voted: No change (500 Million DAI) Reasoning: While I\u2019m not thrilled with the considerable portion of GUSD of overall market cap in Maker\u2019s possession I do not believe a reduction in debt ceiling is a very productive proposal. Reducing this would not have any immediate effect except signal distrust. Maintaining obligations is a core value of my delegate platform and thus it is my belief that we can accomplish more by engaging in dialogue than simply changing a parameter. The current arrangement we have regarding GUSD is at a juncture where we need to re-evaluate, both  the rewards in relation to exposure, but also the transparency when it comes to the placement by the counter-party. It\u2019s my clear belief that steps are being taken in this direction and depending on where they lead we might have to re-visit this or a similar proposal. Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal should be viewed in conjunction with the previous one. I believe encouraging a reduction in GUSD exposure is premature until other options to improve the risk/reward equation has been attempted. Even so given the sizable exposure from a single actor, this move by itself is unlikely to provide a meaningful change. With the competency Maker has built through other RWA exposure we have mechanisms to deploy GUSD on our own to both increase revenue and decrease exposure if other arrangements cannot be reached. ",

It clarifies a few issues that was previously only implied. A needed housekeeping task containing minor changes. Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) Voted: Yes Reasoning: While I\u2019m neither thrilled by the the existance of such a fund nor the reason it is suggested, I do think it pays to be prepared. The way this fund is structured it is my belief that overall it does more good than harm. It also makes sense to deal with potential legal action from a collective standpoint as nobody knows who might be the one on the receiving end. Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) Voted: No Reasoning: While I\u2019m generally in favor of proposals seeking to generate revenue from our PSMs I think the overall risk/reward on this particular proposal means Maker should decline. The big weakness with this particular proposal is firstly that the strategies are possible to do directly by Maker. Secondly the fee is initially high, but more importantly is based on a performance. A performance based fee stacks incentives towards risk taking behavior. As the provider of capital, Maker will thus be exposed for the full risk with only a portion of the rewards. The provider is incentivised to maximize the fee through increased risk. Given that there is a finite amount of USDC to deploy I think Maker is better served by using other solutions. Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This is an easy proposal to support. With the growing number of RWA collateral and the unfortunate dissolution of the RWF core unit, it\u2019s high time Maker paid closer attention. A proposal like this gets the ball rolling until more permanent solutions can be put into place. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network Voted: Yes Reasoning: Lately Chainlink has provided a meaningful portion of the work of the Keeper Network. Onboarding them seems like the sensible thing to do as it strengthens the network overall. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) Voted: No Reasoning: There is a conflict of interest present in this proposal. In order to ensure proper monitoring of assets, that control should come from outside the entity being controlled. While this proposal would presumably increase monitoring and safety somewhat Maker should base their control efforts outside the entity being controlled. Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Tech Ops was one first core units to start the transition to ecosystem actor. As such Maker has a vested interest in seeing them succeed and chart a course for others to follow. In order to do so successfully they require resources, especially in light of the end-game plan and constitution getting pushed back by 6 months. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) Voted:  Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 80% Multiplier for retroactive MKR - additional 85,854 DAI Reject Options  Reasoning: As another core unit transitioning early to ecosystem actor it seems sensible to ensure funding to wind down. On principle I am against retroactive compensations as it goes against my core value of maintaining obligations. As such I was very much in doubt whether to approve any of the options granting such compensation. Still in recognition of the work put in by the core unit and not least to ease the transition an exception seems appropriate in this case. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Due to the transition to the end-game there is likely to be an increase in the usage of MIP-14. In order to expedite governance and reduce governance overhead it seems reasonable to remove the cap associated with MIP-14. Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal removes MIPs for a framwork that is no longer being used. Getting rid of redundant MIPs makes the remaining ones more accessible. Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) Voted: No Reasoning: With the transition to the endgame there is a high likelyhood we will not only need MIP14 but that the need for it will even surpass the use we have seen in the past. As such it seems ill advised to remove it entirely. As the end-game is more implemented we can re-visit this proposal. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) Voted: No Resoning: While I can appreciate the intention behind this proposal, it is my clear view that anything that is time critical can be passed withing the calendar exceptions. Glancing to the calendar and having certain periods of low activity helps structure the overall flow of work and assists in maintaining contributors who might otherwise risk burning out. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) Voted: Yes to both Reasoning: Not all parts of governance is equally important and making sure governance flows is a prime consideration. Following that logic it makes sense that participation of executives should be more heavily weighted than other polls. Voting abstain has its place in governance and should be available and counted as participation, but there comes a point where it ceases to be a useful tool and becomes open to abuse. The proposal as written removes the most obvious edge case. Governance should require participation even if one disagrees with the current strategic direction. ",

The proposed parameters seems to achieve the desired results. Adjust the Debt Floor (dust) Voted: 1. Option 1 - Broad Reduction 2. Option 2 - Limited Reduction Resoning: Dust limits are in essence a trade-off between accessibility and risk. The determining factor is gas cost, both on average and in cases of stress. Maker needs to ensure there is not bad debt being accrued on account of too high gas costs in a liquidation event. In opposition is the need to keep vaults accessible. There is no point in having vaults that are guaranteed to never accrue bad debts if the dust limits are so high nobody can gather enough collateral to use them. In general Maker\u2019s vaults are not optimized for smaller users. However, Maker seeks to be as permissionless as possible. The idea of being permisionless seems to align to making vaults as accessible as reasonably possible. Following this logic the right course of action would be to seek as low dust limit as possible.

As such this proposal represents a step forward. It\u2019s not a final solution and might not even be an optimal solution, but it is progress. It also has the advantage of being a low cost proposal. On the other hand there is an inherent weakness that this is merely the infrastructure to gather information and not the information itself.

Polls ending 9th of February 2023 Update the Multisig Managing the Velodrome NFT Voted: Yes Reasoning: A housekeeping task to update the multisig with new signers that are more active contributors. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal Voted: Yes Reasoning: Declaration of conflict of interest: This delegate currently utilizes a WSTETH-B vault and is thus affected of the proposed changes. The overall direction of this proposal is more or less steady. It does contain some changes that would hopefully cause big improvements for certain collateral. In the last MOMC proposal I applauded the rising of the WSTETH-B vault from 0% to 0.25%. Seeing this trend continue with a further increase to 0.5% seems very prudent. Now the SF matches that of ETH-C which is a good start. It also needs to account for the added risk of being staked ETH on top of that so aiming to match ETH-A seems like a decent goal, even if it might be a little on the hawkish side. The decrease in SF on rETH is intentionally subsidizing this particular vault in relation to risk parameters. With the current debt ceiling this should be manageable but I would like to see a return to proper risk parameters sooner rather than later. In a more general sense the reduction of stability fees to entice increased usage has been of limited success in the past, but given the relatively low impact it has on overall revenue, it may be worth doing this experiment again.

Trying to re-ignite this particular mechanism has been a goal for this delegate ever since. Given the rapidly changing market conditions and Maker starting to deplete the surplus buffer this naturally meant shifting the focus towards increasing revenue and decreasing costs. After all Maker cannot burn more than it accumulates. Seeing the unwillingness to even extend a nod to this mechanism with a completely insignificant economic is a blow for those of us wishing for an autonomous depreciation of the MKR token. Given the massive reduction in exposure on risky debt the surplus buffer is at time of writing considerably larger than necessary, let alone require a limit of $250M. ",

Ratification Poll - Declaration of Intent - Implement a Feature to Refund People who Lost Money Sending Dai to the Dai Contract Address Voted: No Reasoning: The major reason for voting no to this proposal is opportunity cost. While it is unfortunate that users through error lose their DAI but this proposal has illustrated that the sums involved makes it hard to justify the development costs. Longer term I think it would be prudent to look into such a mechanism, but more importantly I think improvements in UI will reduce the numbers and scale of incidents going forward. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP62 to Allow for Changing Communication Responsibilities (MIP4c2-SP33) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal ties up a loose end after GovComs core unit transitioned to become an ecosystem actor. Transfering the responsibility to GovAlpha seems a sensible alternative. Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process (MIP4c2-SP30) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal ammends the interim facilitator process. After having some sub-optimal experiences with interim facilitators this proposal tightens up the process and brings more clarity. Most processes becomes refined through usage so this seems like a good evolutionary step. Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) Voted: Yes Reasoning: This proposal bear many resemblances to HVB bank. It allows for Maker to expand to a new geographic area and establish a comercial relationship with another real world actor. This proposal does require more due dilligence than going into government bonds. With the proposed changes coming into effect this kind of proposal will have to pass out of Maker core and be adopted by a subDAO but it should be similar enough to HVB that the process shouldn\u2019t add too much extra work. Despite the difficulties incurred with the changes coming with the end-game I think it would be worth investigating to get a jump start on the process and make it ready for transition to subDAO. ",

Any stability fee below the DSR is long term unsustainable and needs to be adressed. Any fee should be in excess of the DSR in order to account to the risk incurred to the protocol.

Supported to effectuate already polled governance. Nothing deemed critical to the protocol that warrants withholding support. Polls ending 9th of March 2022 Short Ratification Poll for Phoenix Labs Initial Funding (MIP55c3-SP15) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Given Maker\u2019s stated intention to implement the endgame it logically follows that structures needs to be prepared to get ready for the change. This proposal authorizes funds to incorporate and launch Phoenix labs as one of the inititial organizational structures aiming to transition to a creator sub-DAO. Change takes time and this ask seems appropriate to get preparations underway. Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter Voted: Yes Reasoning: Adjusting dust parameters in order to account for changing market conditions is important to ensure we neither expose the protocol to excessive risk balanced against user accessibility. In this particular case there is room to reduce the dust limit without taking excessive risk in order to give users with lower total funds the opportunity to open vaults. Dust limits are necessary but should\u2019t be excessive so I support this change. Emergency executive 11th of March 2022 Emergency Parameter Changes Voted: Yes Reasoning: This executive is in direct response to market conditions resulting from the uncertain future of SVB and the ripple effects this has caused. Most notably and critical to Maker is the depegging of USDC and the following depegging of DAI due to the sizable exposure to USDC through the PSM. The changes contained in this executive seeks to limit the most immediate exposures of the protocol as well as limit the influx of USDC in the PSM while a further assessment can be made. It is the view of this delegate that these measures will be highly temporary and I\u2019ll be surprised if they remain in excess of a week. This situation illustrates the need for Maker to further diversify our PSM portfolio and exposure to other collateral. Work on that diversification has already started but should be intensified as a consequence of the turbulence we are currently experiencing. Maker should further its role as a responsible actor in DeFi that will support the ecosystem and ensure stability of stablecoins. ",

                    "content": "Emergency Executive 14th of March 2023 Emergency PSM Changes Voted: Yes Reasoning: Voted in favor of the second emergency executive within the span of a week. This one contains emergency changes to the PSM allowing Maker to bypass the pause proxy to set the three PEG stability modules to 0 immediately. It\u2019s intended to provide protection in the event of further market turbulence where other stablecoins depegs significantly to allow DAI to more easily maintain the peg. This change provides an immediate emergency response but also underscores the importance of finding more permanent long term solutions to peg stability. Polls ending March 16th 2023 Remove the DC-IAM from MIP65 (RWA007-A) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal removes the DC-IAM and will allow access to the full increase of any debt ceiling increase to MIP-65 immediately instead of increasing it by 100M every week until it reaches maximum. This allows quicker access to the full revenue but carries a larger risk. There exists some uncertainty in the relationship between the foundation and the arranger in the MIP-65 structure that I think would be prudent to remove before removing this particular safeguard. My expectation is that it would be cleared and we could reintroduce this proposal in a week or two with minimal disruption to operations. It also seems preferable to delaying any and all increase to the DC of MIP-65. Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling Voted: Yes Reasoning: If it wasn\u2019t clear before the events of last weekend showed the importance of having clarity in where the assets backing the peg are and how available and safe they are. Being as connected to other stable coins assessments and exposure is a major risk that needs to be addressed. MIP-65 offers the one structure available that can rapidly deploy large sums of capital into safe assets and that can also increase the protocols revenue. Given that other providers have been slow in offering Maker revenue share proportional to the risk it exposes the protocol to it seems prudent to deploy the capital in order to reduce counter party risk and increase revenue to be able to absorb any potential losses that may occur. Short Ratification Poll for Vault Setting Amendment Subproposal (MIP92c5-SP1) Voted: No Reasoning: Given the recent turmoil surrounding USDC culminating in the depeg that also affected DAI adversely it seems prudent to do re-evaluate Maker\u2019s total exposure to USDC going forward. Until such a time, I think this proposal should be delayed. Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer Voted: Yes Reasoning: Highly excited to support this proposal. It\u2019s imperative that Maker evaluates its risks across all operations and the one place that ties everything together is the surplus buffer. As such any and all excess liquidity should be returned there to be fully evaluated before being deployed into anything else. As such this proposal should not only pass now, but for the basis for a standard operational procedure where every month any excess from MIP-65 (and any similar structures that might be made) is returned to the Surplus Buffer.

                    "content": "Constitution MIP Set Ratification Poll for the Constitution MIP Set Voted: No Reasoning: Executive summary: In my view this highly complex and comprehensive proposal delivers more negative effects than it does positive. The primary flaws are listed below:  The opportunity cost of this reform is already considerable, having consumed most of the DAO\u2019s resources for the past 6 months, potentially leaving existential risks to the protocol unaddressed. With the passage of the proposal the old governance system is abolished while the constitution is still neither finished nor tested. The creation of sub- or meta- DAOs does not sufficiently protect Maker core from substantial potential losses. Governance increases in complexity. The introduction of token emission coupled with a changed and limited burn mechanic is a probable cause of token devaluation. Unless the token is locked long term into contracts it is diluted. Poor minority token protection and diminished token utility.  In sum, the potential gains are uncertain and will further require so much of protocol resources that it risks the future of the protocol. It presents a clear devaluation of the token for any MKR holder not willing to fully commit to a long-term commitment to Maker governance. Further reasoning: I started my journey as a delegate because I was a MKR holder with a significant portion of my personal net value in MKR because I believed in the protocol and because I thought it had the potential to transform finance. During my tenure I have always voted what I believed to be in the interest of MKR holders both large and small. It didn\u2019t matter to me whether I voted with a small or a large amount of delegated MKR, my motivation and assessments remained the same. What have guided me however has been the three core values described in my delegate platform:  Maintaining obligations Growing the profitability of the protocol Simplicity  The constitution as it is presented now presents to me a breach to every one of those core values. I\u2019m aware that it is a work in progress and that it is subject to change, but that has seemingly also been the case as long as I have attended the CVC/DVC calls. The constitution as it is now presented, is a very different beast than the end-game plan as it was presented as a concept in the first meeting back on the 17th of May 2022. The fact that it is so clearly labelled as a work in progress also makes me deeply uncomfortable with bundling this with a dismantling of existing governance. It is clear to me that substantial work is required before this proposal is ready to fully support governance. It is equally clear to me that it represents a major increase in complexity of governance. This complexity is passed on to MKR token holders that is now required to participate or risk seeing their holdings diluted. One possibility is that MKR token holders are willing to pay that investment in time and energy, another possibility is deciding that this token is no longer right for them and dispensing it for other tokens. In my opinion this proposal puts too much faith into the first option while the current trend in the market seems to indicate many choosing the second option. There is a saying that code is law. In this context I\u2019d like to turn it on its head and point out that laws are functionally social code. I can\u2019t see Maker signing off on a piece of code that isn\u2019t fully written and then tested before implementation, yet that is exactly what this proposal is asking for. It is also asking to delete the current operating system while working on the new one. To me this is reckless and irresponsible. I\u2019ll use snippet below to illustrate just how much of a work in progress the current proposal is:  image863\u00d7350 45.1 KB  Regarding MetaDAO and SubDAO, it is still very much unclear how Maker core is protected in the eventuality of any one of them failing. This is of particular concern, given that they are meant to take on risk deemed too high by the core. The proposal as presented thus presents a clear increase in risk tolerance for the protocol. A big risk this proposal introduces to the protocol is opportunity cost. For those who frequent the forums the reduction in meaningful discussions on new creative proposals and solutions to the protocol outside of the constitution has been noticeable. Maker\u2019s exposure to stablecoins, and in particular USDC has been hotly debated before and the consensus is that something needs to be done. The solutions have varied and remain disputed, but the recent de-peg has shown in force how existential this threat is, and how dire the need to address it is. Unfortunately, most of Maker\u2019s resources are now focused on the implementation and consequences of the constitution. While there is potential that scopes will be able to address this issue, it still seems like a lot more work is needed before this will be a fully usable solution. Another potential negative effect of this proposal is the introduction of uncertainty for contributors. The structure and final form is in constant flux leaving contributors in a state of limbo until a final form is agreed upon. This presents a risk in contributors leaving as well as in wasting effort in pursuing plans and options that are subsequently dropped further down the line. While many things done at Maker presents cutting edge technological solutions and needs to go to unchartered waters, this is not true for every aspect of what Maker does. There exists a substantial body of work on organizational theory and how to incentivize contributors. This plan seeks a novel approach and is not founded on any prior research, at least none that has been referenced. The burn mechanic in its current form has also been a hotly debated topic and its resumption was one the elements in the original end-game plan. While it still exists, it is now countered by various planned token emissions which are functionally reverse burning. This coupled with other dilution mechanics, most notably from not being locked in governance, reduces the utility of the token for anyone not fully invested in becoming part of Maker governance. Barring some sudden influx of interested parties, this is likely to put considerable sell pressure and devaluation on the token. Given the reasoning stated above I cannot in good conscience vote in favour of this proposal, at least not in its current form at this time. ",

ACREinvest is our new blockchain venture focused on creating compelling Web3 infrastructure, virtual network services and social incentives for DAOs and other peer-to-peer permissionless stakeholders. We recently launched ACRE DAOs, a Web3 portal for a decentralized impact investment club and its related community ERC-20 token: ACRE Impact. Our Mission at ACREinvest is to regenerate the way capital markets work & for whom. I\u2019m excited to apply two decades of prior legal experience in derivatives and commodities markets to the world of DeFi, and MakerDAO specifically. New products and regulatory policy in markets have long been a hallmark of my work and professional fascination. I\u2019ve been down the crypto rabbit hole full-time since 2017 and have been an avid follower-fan of MakerDAO since that time. Until now I have not had the capacity to dig-in actively on governance, so I\u2019m thrilled to have a wonderful team in place at Acre of America to provide me with this opportunity to nerd out with you all. Further, I am keen to inform the wider world about this important work and experimental process by  publishing online content for a general finance savvy audience that is DeFi and crypto curious. I began my legal career as a Corporate Associate in the derivatives practice group at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP in New York City after graduating from Spelman College and the Yale Law School. Clients included the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d) and as ISDA\u2019s U.S. Outside Counsel I coordinated the work of several sell-side working groups that published documentation and resolved legal, commercial, regulatory and operational issues facing derivatives markets, including for the then-emerging credit derivatives market and launch of the Euro. In later roles I gained extensive deal and transactional experience supporting the fixed-income derivatives, currencies/FX, derivatives prime brokerage and energy trading businesses at Goldman Sachs; derivatives and physical commodities trading at Lehman Brothers; and global commodities merchant trading businesses at Castleton Commodities International. Conflicts of Interest Acre of America does not have any significant conflicts of interest at this time. I pledge to keep the community updated on any developments with our products and services that could present a conflict of interest, and will also inform of personal conflicts that would be appropriate to disclose as a result of any legal client representation or tradfi-style client advisory/asset management obligations.

                    "content": "General Update & January Signal Request Votes January 2022 marks the completion of our first full month as an active Recognized Delegate! ACREinvest received its first delegation of 1,000 MKR on December 14, 2021. During the past six weeks I have been actively listening, learning, reading posts and discussions here in the Forum, attending community meetings and following conversations in our Discord server and Twitter.  And, of course, doing some voting. We have also been hard at work to recruit talented individuals for active participation in Maker Governance through membership at ACRE DAOs, the Web3 impact investment club our firm sponsors. Membership in ACRE DAOs means a person or anon holds 1,000 $ACRE tokens pursuant to an Open Call for Founding Members during the month of December 2021, or via a later distribution of tokens as a reward for participation or other valuable contribution to the ACRE (Autonomous Communities for Regenerative Economies) community. I believe that scaling successful DAO governance requires a social component where individuals who know each other have fun sharing insights and knowledge among a small group. Accordingly, ACREinvest has established a New Products Working Group (NPWG) within ACRE DAOs to experiment with a targeted team approach to increasing permissionless participation and engagement. As of today there are two ACRE DAOs members engaged as thought partners and collaborators through the ACRE DAOs - MKRDAO - NPWG. Participants must be verified ACRE Impact token holders in the ACRE DAOs Discord Server. They will assist me in monitoring the day-to-day happenings at Maker DAO and with subject matter expert analysis, and may also engage directly via their own Forum accounts and independently on Social channels such as Twitter and Discord. To incentivize quality engagement for the long term, we are offering members of this working group a share of our overall Delegate Compensation and $ACRE token rewards commensurate with the value of their contribution to Maker in general, and our analysis for voting purposes as a Recognized Delegate in particular. I, Kianga Daverington, continue to be the sole decider for voting by ACREinvest. In the weeks ahead, ACREinvest will be more active in communicating views on the relevant forum posts ahead of votes. We will use updates to this Delegate Platform to provide monthly summaries of how we voted and why (with links to where we have shared views in other parts of the Forum). Thank you to all members of the community, proposers and Core Units who have reached out privately and assisted me with education, history, context and technical support! Yours truly, Kianga Daverington Founder, ACREinvest  [Signal Request] Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial  Voted YES -  Providing compensation to Recognized Delegates is an important signal to the market and our various stakeholders that the community values a high level of professionalism, commitment and quality within our decentralized governance function.

Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults - January 10, 2022 Signal your support or opposition to Increasing the Dust Parameter for UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2WBTCDAI-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, and UNIV2UNIETH-A.

Having SourceCred rewards signals that we value the effort everyone is making and hopefully the extra DAI correlated with that effort, makes it more fun and satisfying to engage in the activity. The amount of payment itself surely isn\u2019t the sole or even in my case a significant factor. The program expresses appreciation which is otherwise hard to feel from a decentralized group. It says, hey - we see you and your efforts here. Thank you! There\u2019s a psychological component here I haven\u2019t seen mentioned.   [Signal Request] Advance \u201cRapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties\u201d to on-chain poll  Voted YES - Pro-security and efficient DAO operations FTW!  [Signal Request] Raise Gemini Dollar (GUSD) PSM Debt Ceiling To 60 Million DAI  Voted YES - My comment on the corresponding on-chain polling vote:  Notwithstanding the recent drop in utilization, raising the debt ceiling at this time signals our interest and support for diversifying the PSM, and distributing counterparty risk with high-quality issuers such as Gemini.   [Signal Request] MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp  Voted ABSTAIN - My comment on the corresponding on-chain polling vote:  Because the activity related to this poll pre-dates my tenure as a Delegate, I vote to Abstain. However, I hold the principles of immutability and predictability in the highest regard. Retroactive \u201cfixes\u201d can infect governance with moral hazard.

Voted NO with the following on-chain comments:  I am voting no because we have enough exposure to Treasuries and US Federal Reserve risk via USDC. The proposal moves us away from the anti-fragile decentralized stablecoin structure I\u2019d like to see in the world.  Community Greenlight Poll - STABLE-TBILL (US Treasury Securities Up To 12 Months Duration) - January 24, 2022 Signal your support or opposition to prioritising onboarding STABLE-TBILL (US Treasury Securities Up To 12 Months Duration).

Voted YES in line with my previous support of delegate compensation as a necessary element for incentivizing the high level of professional, sustainable, consistent and quality governance MakerDAO requires. Offloading TUSD-A - February 7, 2022 Rank your preferred options to resolve the proposed offloading of TUSD collateral. Voted YES for reasons discussed here:    [Signal Request] Offloading TUSD-A Signal Requests       In my view of the world, unfinished business sitting dormant for a year has a way of putting a psychic drain on everything else. I am absolutely in favor of cleaning this up and running a tight ship. Agreeing here with @hexonaut on taking the path of least resistance and not putting pressure on devs. I voted to activate liquidations.     Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper - February 7, 2022 Signal your support or opposition to restarting the MKR burn by introducing Rate Limiting into the Flapper. Voted NO as I misread this poll as being a proposal to bring back the MKR burn per the related Signal Request. I do support the decision to introduce rate limiting into the Flapper. 1 Poll - Ended Feb 17 2022 16:00 UTC Increase the PSM-GUSD Debt Ceiling - February 14, 2022 Signal your support or opposition for adjusting the PSM-GUSD Debt Ceiling from 10 million DAI to 60 million DAI. Voted YES and posted this comment on-chain:  Notwithstanding the recent drop in utilization, raising the debt ceiling at this time signals our interest and support for diversifying the PSM, and distributing counterparty risk with high-quality issuers such as Gemini.  With additional comments here:    [EXECUTIVE VOTE NOTICE] 3F Delegate Cannot Support an INCREASE of the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling Governance       May I ask what is the harm and/or significant opportunity cost to increasing the GUSD PSM debt ceiling? Diversifying issuer risk among high quality stablecoins in the PSM should be a top priority. Gemini fits the bill! The immediate situation of low utilization does not concern me other than to demonstrate that we need a strategic effort to strengthen the relationship. This increase will serve as a signal to the market of our priorities and focus in this regard.     1 Poll - Ended Feb 24 2022 16:00 UTC MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Compensation - February 21, 2022 Signal your support or opposition to compensating MakerMan for Recognized Delegate activities in the month of November.

Ratification Poll for Onboarding the Maker Talent Core Unit (MT-001) - February 14, 2022 This MIP set adds the Maker Talent Core Unit, MT-001.

I agree with your views and also do not support this MIP.  Let me add that even with ample resources I would recommend we focus on the long-term vision and those highly strategic capacities and counterparties that will get us there.  For example, bringing real world assets on-chain and completing our risk assessments, policies and standards for permissionless use by top-tier counterparties and institutions.

I\u2019m eager to see communications and operations optimized for global participation and perspectives.  [Signal Request] Promote \u201cMIP4c3-SP2: MIP62 Amendments\u201d to an on-chain poll  Voted YES - it is good governance to have clarifications and administrative fixes go through a process of verification.  [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG  Voted NO - not a fan of gold-backed cryptocurrency [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG - #24 by ACREinvest  As a personal aside, I find the idea that gold is great for DeFi to be hilariously ironic and false. I\u2019m assuming a tokenized gold product functions or trades like a cash-settled futures contract (?), but do admit I am not yet familiar with this particular instrument. In any case, all that we are trying to innovate away from in DeFi is brought right back to center with onboarding a precious metal/commodity-backed token as collateral. We face the worst of Counterparty Risk, Credit Risk, Legal Risk, Political Risk and lack of any transparent mechanism to verify absolutely the ability to foreclose on a contractual claim to gold allegedly held in a vault somewhere. What are the proofs of the authenticity and provenance of said gold? Market confidence in the representational value of such a product is too easily destroyed for this to be an attractive collateral type in my view.]  I discuss additional risk factors for the community to consider here [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG - #30 by ACREinvest  I have not been able to locate on the Forum or on the Paxos website the specific PAXG product terms and conditions. For our community Due Diligence purposes we should also have (or have access to view) copies of contracts and counterparty agreements that confirm and detail the third party commercial arrangements as described in the initial proposal (brought forward to the current date).   Given the physical nature of the gold markets and structure backing PAXG, we need to carefully verify marketing descriptions and also understand the interpretation of fine print. For example, Force Majeure is defined to include such broadly described and regularly occurring events as \u201ccryptoasset market collapse or fluctuations.\u201d   How might sanctions/AML/KYC requirements limit the ability of a party to convert PAXG to gold?   [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance  Voted NO - Requests for important additional information in the linked comment below about the specific economic arrangement and commercial ties between the Recognized Delegate proposer and counterparty Notional Finance were ignored and not provided in the Forums and not addressed in the community call. [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance - #20 by MadShills Founder of Notional had an extremely poor response to my questions about the company\u2019s internal analysis of its and its products\u2019 regulatory status and enforcement risk. I communicated my intention to vote No in this comment for the reasons stated [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance - #25 by ACREinvest My views on the topic Expectations of a Delegate as pertaining to the ACREinvest Delegate Platform are discussed in this thread Expectations of a delegate - #5 by ACREinvest . I fully embrace the reality that others will have different views about how to engage with the community around these issues, and believe that a diversity of approaches is important and healthy. That said, my own values on this topic will influence my vote when I detect Conflicts of Interest and potential Abuses of Power that in my opinion could harm the culture and trust bonds of MakerDAO, not to mention leave us worse off than if specific conflicts are avoided or appropriate detailed disclosures are made for the community to make an informed vote.  Judicial Approach  Without there being an explicit mandate from the community for Delegates to operate in this mode, ACREinvest views the delegate role more in the vein of a Judiciary actor. Accordingly, from my perspective initiating proposals would not be appropriate especially if the proposal includes a paid role for the Delegate or an affiliate to provide other services to the DAO. Dispassionate neutrality across the entire scope of matters before the DAO is what I\u2019m striving for!   At this nascent stage of DeFi it is probably impossible and even undesirable to have a black-and-white, or rigidly proscribed conflicts policy. However, I do think now is a good time to elevate a discussion about Separation of Powers, and in any case set forth some daylight standards for proposals where a Conflict of Interest has been disclosed.   [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Part II  Voted NO [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Part II - #29 by ACREinvest  \u2026purely on the merits of what is best for the protocol right now as we find the world today. I am against the burn. The fact that the change was implemented as a solution to an emergency has no bearing whatsoever on whether it is appropriate to maintain even though the urgent moment is past. November 2021 is gone. We must stay on our toes and forward looking. This shows the strength and credibility of our governance process!   [Signal Request] Real World Asset Fast-Tracking  Voted NO rather emphatically. [Signal Request] Real World Asset Fast-Tracking - #6 by ACREinvest  No, no, absolutely not. What is going on here? A \u201cfast-track\u201d process makes no sense at all. An ill considered, \u201ctemporary\u201d process snatches defeat from the jaws of victory. @williamr is not at all overstating his case.

Also, I sense a general theme across the community of frustration with the friction and patience required to implement long-term solutions. Every attempt to grab \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d or do quick \u201ctemporary\u201d measures dilutes our focus and the potency we need as a community to navigate this massive decentralized ship.

Let me add that even with ample resources I would recommend we focus on the long-term vision and those highly strategic capacities and counterparties that will get us there.

Voted YES - due to user error that caused me to MISS casting my YES vote for Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount (MIP4c3-SP1) - March 14, 2022. I intended to vote NO as this proposal involves too many entanglements with centralized regulated counterparties and rent-seeking arrangements. Some thoughts from the Forum on related topics:     Grant Announcement: KYC/AML Compliance Research Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling       Thank you for your comments. Excellent questions for us all to engage with and answer thoroughly and thoughtfully. My Poll vote in favor of this Declaration of Intent was an unfortunate result of user error MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds. I\u2019ll go into more detail on why I intended to vote NO in my March month-end Delegate Platform summary post.

We are going to see the market cap and adoption grow exponentially for these and social tokens/tokenized communities (track the leaders here: Market | Forefront).  While #ReFi and social tokens are somewhat of a separate phenomenon, there\u2019s a converging of modes taking place. IMO we need a stronger dose of \u201cFi\u201d to power the \u201cRe\u201d (need more de-finance expertise to add to the rege\u2026     Ratification Poll for Facilitators Offboarding (MDS-001) (MIP41c5-SP5) - March 14, 2022 This subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitators of the MakerDAO Shop. Voted YES - with the following on-chain comment  I understand the Facilitators have resigned, which was not clear until recently. This Poll may be unnecessary. For the avoidance of doubt, I am voting yes so that either way we shut it down.  Ratification Poll for GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) - March 14, 2022 MIP40c3-SP59 adds a 12-month DAI budget of 1,109,793 DAI for the GovAlpha Core Unit starting in April 2022.

VAMOS    MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) Archive       On the road to RWA glory, we pass through Top-Tier Legal or perish.

LFG WAGMI     Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) - March 14, 2022 This budget proposes MKR compensation for GovAlpha (GOV-001) with a vesting component.

Ratification Poll for Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) - March 14, 2022 The current bug bounty payment process is adequate for large payouts, but inconvenient for small payouts. This MIP adds a small payout process. Voted YES - good adjustment to refine and strengthen the Bug Bounty program. Ratification Poll for Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) - March 14, 2022 This proposal describes how Recognized Delegates will be compensated. Voted YES - Absolutely in favor of compensation for the governance work of Recognized Delegates. It is solidly in the best interest of MakerDAO to signal to the market, community and other stakeholders the seriousness of the DAO to invest in the professionalization of our operations and process. This means we cannot sustain, nor grow well with a volunteer model for the crucial work of governance oversight that is not suited for all MKR holders to actively engage in. I don\u2019t see any conflict in voting yes as a Recognized Delegate who benefits from the Poll, or any reason why Recognized Delegates should abstain. Just because a voter benefits from a proposal does not automatically create a conflict of interest. I had no hand in initiating this MIP61 and have not taken any public or private actions to promote it, or influence the vote of others. On-chain comment:  It\u2019s my pride and joy to work for MKR holders! Thank you for recognizing the value of this important work.  4 Polls - Ending Mar 31 2022 16:00 UTC Short Ratification Poll for SPF ETHAmsterdam Event (MIP55c3-SP3) - March 28, 2022 Signal your support or opposition to approving Special Purpose Fund ETHAmsterdam Event (MIP55c3-SP3) Voted NO - I\u2019m generally a rules and procedure stickler because I believe it\u2019s the best and only way to ensure maximum fairness and good outcomes over time. So, I will tend not to be persuaded to vote against principle because of the specific individuals involved or certain substantive merits.    MIP55c3-SP3: ETHAmsterdam Event SPF RFC       My reading confirms this to be an accurate summary of the facts. Not the way to do things.  I am not going to Amsterdam and am voting no for the same reasons stated here:         MIP55c3-SP3: ETHAmsterdam Event SPF RFC       To be clear, me not attending has nothing to do with my vote. It was a comment to push back against the assertion that all delegates will vote yes because they are attending and want to enjoy a boondoggle.  Apologies for the confusion! It looks like the Poll will succeed, so I am happy for all the good that will come of it. I do follow your points, but I stand by the principles articulated in the sentiments I quoted.

We cannot neglect to empower this team for marketing and branding purposes, but also for ourselves. I was in Denver and although I did not attend the party, I saw how much it made everyone happy and eyes sparkle!! This sort of thing is 100% aligned with developing a \u201csocial token\u201d investment thesis for MKR which I would like to see us all lean into.  In the Forum:    MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) Formal Submission       I am voting in favor of adding the Events Core Unit.  I\u2019ve been encouraging the community to look at the nascent sector of social tokens. We can add utility to MKR via its use for social access and belonging. Would this team be willing to research and incorporate these approaches into the events?  For example, MKR holders should be able to claim an exclusive event NFT they can show for admission to a VIP section of the event. Perks might be combined with event sponsors for free drinks. The sky i\u2026         MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) Formal Submission       To be clear, the leading communities have ERC20 membership tokens, which also are used directly to token-gate IRL events as well as their community portals and private Discord channels.     Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022 MIP67 intends to formalise the methodology and high-level process to evaluate structured finance transactions made under the MIP6 application process. Voted - YES - I love TFW a colleague has so eloquently stated the reason to support a proposal that I can do no better than copy and past it here.  100% this, and especially appreciate the call out to prepare a process for small players and start ups.     Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Platform   Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022 Voted \u201cYES,\u201d in support of a methodology that will implement checks and balances\u2013a benchmark that will help attract quality borrowers and clarifies the necessary frameworks needed in order to onboard RWA collateral types. This framework will also help align and communicate to the world, the necessary requirements needed in order to become an RWA collateral type. We believe implementing a framework that hails MakerDAO as a senior secured lender with favorable rights for loan transactions. This will help the DAO determine what course of action it should take when a Default occurs. It will also help the RWF CU, incubating LOVE-01 CU, and proposed Legal CU create assessments that can determine if the MIP6 applicant has the ability to pay Stability Fees and principal under the terms of the legal/deal documents. Without an RWA methodology, we believe MakerDAO will not be taken serious as a Real World Lender. And because we believe that some digital asset will become global powerhouses, DAI must be showcased as a digital asset that has the ability to compete on the World\u2019s stage. MIP67 will help real world financing companies understand the requirements needed in order to access DAI RWA Vaults, a powerful tool. It will also help showcase the current RWA Core Units team members years of experience in selecting the right projects, and structuring RWA deals in a correct manner. However, let\u2019s not forget that MKR token owners will always have the final say. 3F Delegate is a proponent of implementing a secondary RWA Core Unit that will provide incoming RWA startups the ability to access the powerful tools of MakerDAO. This secondary Core Unit will inspired the next Generation MIP6 applicants to showcase themselves. Perhaps a former employee of a successful borrower who acquired the expertise and is now ready to explore uncharted waters. Such CU should follow a different Methodology that allows entrepreneurs the access and the freedom to perform lending best practices via Maker Vaults. After all, MakerDAO was built by taking-on Risk. And finally, we cannot begin to tell you how many times we have been ask by personal connections hailing from TradFi organizations, as to why MakerDAO is giving out risk-free loans? Some sounded baffled\u2013as they proceeded to deviate from further discussing if MakerDAO is a serious lender. And it\u2019s these misconception that can easily attract fraudulent borrowers. The MakerDAO community cannot afford to take on risks that it cannot afford. The off-chain world is opaque, and many borrowers are inexperienced. Defaults will happen. With a Surplus Buffer that allows this DAO to take minimal off-chain risk, there\u2019s no viable reason why MIP67 should not be supported.   ",

I appreciate the importance of timely communication by Recognized Delegates, so am working to find a happy balance of spending available time on the substance while also maintaining good records here! I look forward to the work we are doing as a community to better clarify and establish a common understanding of the Delegate role and/or the specific modes and views that distinguish how each of us approaches the responsibilities. My approach to date has been to observe as much as possible without participating in debate unless I have a specific question, concern or point of view I feel strongly about expressing in a particular context. This accords with my tendency to vote toward the very end of any allowable window, which gives me the best view of community perspectives. I believe my role as Recognized Delegate includes overwhelming support for the efforts and contributions of our Core Units and Mandated Actors, unless removed or to the extent sanctions or reprimand result through a community agreed process. I have a responsibly to be an optimistic and enthusiastic champion of our collective success, not a naysayer. I will not hesitate to go against popular opinion or bluntly state my objections. But at the end of the day I view myself as a servant of the DAO (not just MKR holders) which requires I evaluate decisions with deference to others where appropriate and not just based on my particular view of the world. You all deserve to know my crypto political and policy views so you can assess how I\u2019m likely to vote and engage around the very important conversations we are having about the future of the DAO, as well as, how best to navigate in the short-term. In brief: I drank all the Web3 kool-aide. And why not? I left WallStreetistan for a reason. So far, after 6 years in crypto I can honestly say there\u2019s no better place to apply belief (and hope!) than MakerDAO. My votes below reflect the trust I have in this incredible community. The people who have proposed budgets know better than I do what they need for their time and to accomplish their mandates. I am very concerned that non of you feel unappreciated and unseen! There is no one here who is getting paid enough in pure dollars today to compensate for the opportunity cost of your life, time and talent pursuing this wild endeavor. We are still at such an experimental stage with no idea really where exactly this goes, or how to get there. But if you are reading this, you probably feel something strongly that you can\u2019t see. Thus humility in all we do is crucial, but we must lean in and especially now during a most turbulent time ahead. 2 POLLS - ENDED APR 21 2022 16:00 UTC  Short Ratification Poll to Amend MIP64 to allow more flexibility in scope (MIP4c3-SP3) - April 18, 2022 Voted - YES  Whitelist Oasis.app on Multiple Oracles (MIP10c9-SP30) - April 18, 2022 Voted - YES 10 POLLS - ENDED APR 25 2022 16:00 UTC (see prior post for additional 2 polls ending on this date but voted earlier ACREinvest Delegate Platform - #13 by ACREinvest)  Ratification Poll for Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh (MIP39c2-SP30) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP62) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022 Voted - YES  Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) - April 11, 2022.

My high level take away is that your team is looking to MakerDAO for education and to determine for you key commercial terms of both deals. This is not our role. I am not enthusiastic about diverting the precious time and resources of our CUs to comb through all of this information without there being a pre-diligenced and comprehensive term sheet, structure, etc. etc. proposed for us to react to. I am not in favor of either MIP6s progressing. Given the jurisdictions, legal, political and sanctions risk involved, I cannot see a scenario where the collateral and credit support proposed provide any security whatsoever for MakerDAO in the event of a default. Further, the significant use of proceeds to refinance exciting debt is not attractive.

For votes below in favor of raising the ESM minimum threshold and adjusting the lid parameter on the rate limited flapper, ultimately I was persuaded these adjustments were in the best interest of the protocol\u2019s security and prudent risk management. In this update I\u2019d like to briefly share a few items to provide some color on what\u2019s standing out as core concerns from my perspective as a Delegate at ACREinvest. Each of the linked comments and proposals below illustrate extremely valid critiques and potential solutions for the challenges facing MakerDAO today. We urgently need to empower a DAO-wide/overall-DAO full-time executive function separate from, but integrated with CUs. This group must have specific domain expertise and credentialed experience unlocked through both a delegation of responsibility approved by MKR holder vote and adequate compensation/incentives. I am not convinced this should be work undertaken by Delegates or MKR holders (per se). Without adding bureaucracy and operational complexity, there needs to be someone(s) in charge of the big picture who can operate transparently and with complete disclosures regarding actual and potential conflicts of interest. Who (i.e., what kind of actor) is in the best position of trust to be responsible for understanding everything that\u2019s happening and capable to communicate the information legibly to the various stakeholders in the MakerDAO ecosystem (not just MKR holders)? We must achieve consensus on the answer quickly to maintain the legitimacy necessary to reach our full potential, while also remaining a pioneer in how an open, permissionless decentralized organizational structure in DeFi can work at scale. Food for thought:     The MKR holder Confessional Miscellaneous       Why I sold my MKR  After thinking long and hard I sold my stack of MKR several months ago. This post came as a good opportunity to explain why.  The initial design  As most of you know MakerDAO is one of the very first DAOs, with a initial design dating back to the start of Ethereum. Having such ancient DNA does however come with a cost - all the functions that since DeFi summer started can be found in other protocols had to be designed into Maker from the start.

Always thoughtful. I appreciate the time and effort to draw an analogy to a structure familiar in finance. Rather than blithely tearing up the playbook, we should always be looking toward precedent/history for lessons as to how to best design systems.  Ultimately, the efficacy of a system lies in in the incentives embedded within it.

In anticipation of risk assessments for SG Forge and HVB being published soonest, @eumenes and @christiancdpetersen are providing to the Forum a modified version of their presentation of May 4,\u2026     Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold - May 16, 2022 (thread](Mimecast TTP Web Portal)) Voted: Yes Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate Limited Flapper - May 16, 2022 (thread](Mimecast TTP Web Portal)) Voted: Yes Ratification Poll for Monetalis Clydesdale, Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution (MIP65) - May 9, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We stand at a crossroad. Will this community evolve to allow a meritocracy of transparent governance that resists centralized power and coercive tactics by those who would seek to capture the value and potential of this DAO for a small group of insiders? ACREinvest votes no on both Monetalis proposals which outsource for significant rents many of the same functions we have already painstakingly designed and resourced for internally via Core Units. The approval of this poll reflects a poor choice for how to optimize our current pole position, talent pool and resources for maximum effect in the rapidly innovating realm of DeFi and ReFi (regenerative finance). For further commentary, see updates to the ACREinvest Delegate Platform post on the Forum this coming week. Ratification Poll for Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending (MIP68) - May 9, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We stand at a crossroad.

For further commentary, see updates to the ACREinvest Delegate Platform post on the Forum this coming week. Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) - May 9, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Very happy to support this kind of upgrade which is inline with promoting MakerDAO as core DeFi settlement and transaction infrastructure. Ratification Poll for MIP40 Budget Process Amendment (MIP4c2-SP19) - May 9, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: The budget process absolutely needs this overhaul given the scale of our operations. The additional pain in the short term should have the beneficial effect of helping CUs achieve their business goals. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) - May 9, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: ACREinvest votes no due to the proposal not meeting the standards of professionalism and accountability necessary for a Core Unit. Even after many revisions and especially in light of current market conditions, the requested budget is not fiscally prudent without being closely integrated with an overall marketing and strategic plan (that may best be managed and executed cooperatively by multiple CUs). Community Greenlight Poll - FEI (Fei USD) - May 16, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight) Reasoning: Very supportive of this opportunity to support Tribe DAO and build ecosystem resiliency among natively decentralized protocols and communities. This proposal makes a positive contribution to advancing organic DAI growth as discussed in A North Star - DAI as the Destination - a strategic consideration important for the longer-term view. Investigate Implementation of an Antalpha Institutional Vault - May 23, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight) Reasoning: Happy to see us expand IV with this strong counterparty, but please do consider how we might implement with a larger number of vaults of lower value per vault. Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH - May 23, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Having fixed costs denominated in ETH is quite a valid reason to have some ETH. Sized correctly and with regular small purchases (DCA) would be important for implementation - we do not want to speculate on the price in the short term. This is not turning us into fund managers, but rather better aligning our overall performance with ether\u2019s long-term upside ROI that we certainly should hold as a base case. Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: There is no free lunch. Someone always pays. It should be the customers and not us. Failure to recoup any costs from launch is a form of taking losses rather than generating some income as thoughtfully proposed here where we can be both competitive and adaptable to changing market conditions in the future.

Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Voting yes here is a big reversal. ACREinvest until now has consistently signaled and polled no on burning MKR. In light of market conditions and challenges for the months to come, I favor supporting the views of a large part of the community regarding the burn at this time. You could say I\u2019m placing a new premium on compromise that boosts unity and morale where the trade off is controlled and appropriately risk-managed. I am comfortable with this trial given the limited scope as proposed here and, importantly, in light of recent liquidations increasing the SB over the past few days\u2026 plus, the technological experimentation is attractive. Given the brutal price action across the crypto ecosystem, an open market buy of MKR would be a very powerful signal now whether or not in the ordinary course the burn makes sense as part of normal operations.     [Signal Request] Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn Signal Requests       I very much respect that the burn is a very important part of MakerDAO for many members of the community. Framing this finance issue in terms of a social contract is interesting and a concept I struggle with on two fronts.  One: How does a social contract evolve as a DAO scales, becomes more decentralized and needs to onboard large numbers of new stakeholders to thrive?  Two: If one believes the economic impact does not match the lore of the burn, is it appropriate to continue for emotional reas\u2026     Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Excited about this project and appreciate these suggestions to assist the community until we have a more active metagovernance process in place to support the partnership.     [Signal Request] Incoming Velodrome Airdrop on Optimism - $VELO veNFT Signal Requests       This is sooooo exciting! I am very interested in assisting with the active governance of this on behalf of MakerDAO so we do not have to rely on the Velodrome team. Would the community support a metaGovernance proposal from ACREinvest and anyone in particular have capacity to help me with a proposal?     Add rETH as a new Vault Type - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: ACREinvest cannot support adding to the backlog at this time with increased exposure to a staked ETH product in the current environment. Also cautious due to the current specter of contagion from failure/insolvency of large forced sellers across the ecosystem. Very happy to revisit once the dust settles, and hope to see a better ROI picture at that time given the resources that would be required to onboard and sustain the vault. ",

                    "content": "NEWS: ACREinvest has submitted a proposal for Kianga Daverington to serve as Interim Chief Legal Officer of MakerDAO for a limited period of 6 months via a MIP55 Special Purpose Fund. View the proposal and community discussion here: MIP55c3-SP5: Interim Chief Legal Officer Summary of Executive & Polling Votes cast June 16 - 22, 2022 Community Greenlight Poll - KREDIKA (Kredika LTD) - June 6, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: I like the proposal, but from a timing and internal resources perspective do not want to add this to the cue until we have cleared the deck of deals near completion. Also key to my decision is the need to reserve capacity for the heightened credit and market risk review that\u2019s required across our current book. Until there is a better picture of the impact on our business and partners from the unfolding blowups and defaults, MakerDAO needs to focus on current obligations and existing relationships. Community Greenlight Poll - XSGD (StraitsX) - June 6, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: I very much support expanding the stablecoin collateral base of the protocol to other national currencies. How best to do that and when will take a significant amount of investigation and focused work. Accordingly, I repeat the need to reserve capacity for the heightened credit and market risk review that\u2019s required across our current book. Until there is a better picture of the impact on our business and partners from the unfolding blowups and defaults, MakerDAO needs to focus on current obligations and existing relationships. Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Abstain Reasoning: Please see my comments on the Forum explaining why I abstain https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554/29?u=acreinvest Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class - June 6, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Abstain Reasoning: Please see my comments on the Forum explaining why I abstain https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554/29?u=acreinvest Active Polls 11 POLLS - ENDING JUN 27 2022 16:00 UTC Reasoning provided with on-chain comments: All 11 of my poll votes today are cast as a resounding YES to the proposals and budget increases, as applicable. Please see my follow-up Delegate Platform post for specific reflections on each poll. But overall, why? Penny wise, Pound foolish is a warning my mother used to utter. I applaud every person in this community who has taken the initiative to express a vision and plan for actions. Now is the moment to empower them with a vote of trust to be excellent stewards of resources and their responsibilities. I trust they will all remain accountable to Governance and have the intention, integrity and intelligence to adjust budgets and priorities as appropriate where needed. We are heading into a period of unprecedented destruction. The fate of many generations will be determined by what each of us does right now. The people working for MakerDAO in Core Units and Mandated Actors are the army we have in place to meet this moment. They are the best in the business and best-in-class. We should not take them for granted. We cannot replace them, nor should we. We need their loyalty and enthusiasm to ensure DAI is available to re-liquify the world when the dust settles. No one has better information right now than the people who have stepped up via these proposals to move this organization forward. The governance checks in place are entirely sufficient to course correct or address unforeseen problems with the execution of these mandates. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001 - @psychonaut (MIP41c4-SP34) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: I appreciate Joshua\u2019s consistent presence and initiative he is taking to contribute more to MakerDAO. With community support I\u2019m sure he can do very well in this role and work constructively to revise the CU structure or mandate if that makes sense in the future. Travin\u2019s recommendation was an important positive factor in this determination. MIP41c4-SP34: Immunefi Security Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding - IS-001 - #17 by TravinImmunefi Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to DIN-001 - @tadeo (MIP41c4-SP35) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: Tadeo is doing terrific work for the DAO and I believe he will do a great job bringing more needed visibility to the work of this CU and assist in integrating its products in ways that will benefit the ecosystem even more. Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: Luca brings tremendous understanding and capabilities in crucial growth areas for MakerDAO. Highly supportive of formalizing this work in its own CU to improve resiliency, coordination and reputation among the next frontier of counterparties based primarily outside the cryptoverse. Ratification Poll for Task Forces (MIP75) - June 13, 2022. (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: There is a great need for more flexible and composable ways to collaborate productively across Core Units, and to decrease the stagnation occurring from a single, one-size fits all approach to governance cycles for functions that could be delegated with appropriate accountability. Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: The need for active Treasury Management is urgent. This is a conservative proposal to begin and we must. With the giga brains we are fortunate to have fired up to deliver results, ACREinvest is highly supportive of this mandate that grants some autonomy here and keeps the best people innovating for MakerDAO. Talent is too constrained under the status quo. Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: Excellent change moving Executive to mid-week voting for all the reasons stated! Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: As mentioned above, supportive of a more composable and responsive operating model for many decisions that need to be taken in the day-to-day operations of the DAO. MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations - #16 by ACREinvest Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve increased budget Additional Comments: Give the talent the resources they need! I am anti-austerity at this crucial time in the early stages of what MakerDAO is poised to become. Earning a positive net income because\u2026 profit?, makes no strategic sense whatsoever. There is not a single important business franchise dominating in its field originating in the past 20 years that achieved their status by being profitable from day one and limiting ambitions. Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Additional Comments: All good for keeping things running on rails. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve increased budget (BaseGrowth) Additional Comments: Ditto from above: Give the talent the resources they need! I am anti-austerity at this crucial time in the early stages of what MakerDAO is poised to become. Earning a positive net income because\u2026 profit?, makes no strategic sense whatsoever. There is not a single important business franchise dominating in its field originating in the past 20 years that achieved their status by being profitable from day one and limiting its ambitions. Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve Task Force and associated delegated authority to spend funds 2nd choice: Approve Task Force without associated delegated authority to spend funds Additional Comments: Ditto from above. Executive : MKR Vesting Transfers - June 22, 2022 Supported Reasoning: Composed of validly approved determinations through our established governance process. No objections. ",

This weak attempt at disclosure and resolving conflicts of interest is wholly inadequate: My involvement with Monetalis The cozy relationship that is being further pushed in centralized fashion by Rune\u2019s actions using extraordinary measures to force his desired out come for polls closing this week is a direct threat to the decentralization trajectory MakerDAO was clearly pursuing when ACREinvest decided to participate as a Recognized Delegate in December. Power moves such as reducing ACREinvest\u2019s voting power by half in those controversial votes within 15 minutes of votes closing does not shine of legitimacy as a credible and professional organization. Why does the community tolerate this attempt to capture all the DAO\u2019s resources and focus to financially benefit Rune\u2019s friends while sowing chaos across all channels to disrupt the otherwise productive, capable and serious work being accomplished by the RWF teams, including without a doubt LOVE? On the merits of investing in US Treasuries, I am against. We already have enough (too much) U.S. government debt exposure and political risk through USDC.

                    "content": "DAVERINGTON HOUSE RULES When I joined MakerDAO in December 2021 as a Recognized Delegate, the vibez were impeccable. My first contact was @prose11 who demontrated incredible warmth, friendliness and patience as I truly struggled to navigate the Forum for even the most basic information. Immediately, as soon as I published this Delegate Platform, @PaperImperium reached out with another warm welcome and invited me to join the Delegates chat group. All the other current Delegates at that time extended themselves and expressed enthusiasm for my joining their ranks. I thank you all and am so grateful for your continuing support! The Delegate chat is a place of informal banter and conversation. It was invaluable for me as a total outsider to have a small group I could relate with directly and learn a ton by osmosis. Plus, everyone was super helpful by answering questions or providing information to assist my getting up to speed. What also struck me at the time in those first months among OGs and newer Delegates was how collegial everyone is! There were disagreements absolutely and some clashes of opinion. But no matter how passionate the exchange, everyone always maintained respect. I never once detected that disagreements became personal attacks, or in any way compromised our ability to operate independently, yet still feel a sense of comradeship given our shared caring for this project. @MakerMan Don\u2019t go!!! Announcement - At end of term MakerMan will be retiring as a delegate. The weekly G&R (Governance and Risk) calls were also quite fun. @Davidutro used to que amazing mood music as we gathered and more people attended with their cameras on than do today. Ah,  today\u2026 Something has radically shifted in the culture and quality of community interactions. Many people are speaking about it, thinking about it and feeling it. Now I am a liberty minded person, so I don\u2019t like being told what to do and I try to refrain from telling others how they should think, behave and, most importantly, what they should value or believe. I am a die hard for VOLUNTARISM and FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. I hope I am a very tolerant person. I think my professional and personal life shows I can get along really well with all KINDS of people. But at the end of the day, let each person police themselves (or not) and let others chose to associate (or not). Simple, really. In the wider Web3 and DAO space, we are struggling greatly with how to have open communities with low barriers to entry and no \u201cgate-keeping,\u201d but that otherwise maintain healthy relationships among the participants, so we can work productively (and enjoyably!) together. A lot of communities are creating Codes of Conduct like this one at SEED CLUB: Snapshot I\u2019m a $CLUB holder. I signed it. I think it\u2019s totes fine that\u2019s how SEED CLUB rolls. They (it/we?) are trying to protect who they (we) are and what we want to achieve together. However, if I were a co-founder of a new tokenized community (oh wait, I am!) I don\u2019t think this approach aligns with some of my personal core values, but I have no inner conflict about agreeing and accepting the rules any community sets for participation in principle. I voluntarily choose to associate with the community, and these are the rules. >>> I <<< accept. That was easy. Accordingly, I have no issue with abiding by the SEED CLUB Code of Conduct, but honestly (between you and me) it probably does dampen my enthusiasm a little. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to mandate \u201csafe spaces\u201d and the attempt to do so probably has the opposite effect in practice. I really appreciate this proposal by Recognized Delegate @Hasu and do support the creation of a non-scientific document that specifies what MakerDAO is here to do, why and how. Simple MakerDAO \u2014 Governance from first principles - #58 by Miguel_Cabeza One urgent issue we don\u2019t spend enough time on at MakerDAO is the social/human dynamic of what we do here and how. I believe membership in the Council should have requirements about reputation and character that demonstrate members have sufficient EQ to understand and support the most sophisticated and advanced technology asset we have here - the HUMAN SPIRIT.  What is emotional intelligence or EQ? Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:   Self-management \u2013 You\u2019re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.  Self-awareness \u2013 You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.  Social awareness \u2013 You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.  Relationship management \u2013 You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.   I\u2019m supportive of a new effort to create a community/MKR holder ratified constitution-like document, but this should NOT be a Code of Conduct or set of rules for community member behavior. Instead, I have what I think is a novel approach in today\u2019s culture. I am going to set my own personal code of conduct.  These are Daverington House Rules. They apply to the individual writing this post (Kianga Daverington) and do not apply to any other person or business entity. As long as I speak and act for ACREinvest here, however, it will pertain to how ACREinvest shows up in community meetings and conversations. Anyone is free to associate with me or not based on my personal code of conduct. I welcome anyone pointing out when/if my actions in the community violate my own Daverington House Rules and to take whatever actions he/she/they find appropriate. If you\u2019ve read this far and still don\u2019t know why I am adopting this personal code of conduct. Let me be succinct: The quality of human interaction at MakerDAO is devolving. Should this continue I believe it will be fatal to the organization. No software upgrade, token incentives or restructuring is going to save it. Since I cannot control anyone else (and do not want to), I must consider what it is that I CAN do. The DAVERINGTON HOUSE RULES can be simply stated as: Two strikes and I\u2019m out!  If Kianga Daverington is attending a community meeting or engaged in an async conservation and observes any of the below Offending Behaviors according to her exclusive determination of the matter,   she will raise an objection in writing or verbally once\u2026 twice\u2026 and if the Offending Behavior against anyone or group in that meeting or conversation continues, Ms. Daverington will end the meeting (if she is the host) or she will leave the meeting/conversation if merely a participant. \u201cOffending Behavior\u201d means any of the following:    Psychological Operations designed to manipulate through deflection, gas-lighting, projection or other covert tactics Grand Standing Excessive Rudeness Personal attacks directed to anyone participating in such meeting or conversation (or not present) Trolling (especially in writing in the chat during live meetings when people are having a verbal discussion)   The next ACREinvest Delegate Office Hours will take place on Wed, July 6 at 15:00 EST | 19:00 UTC and the topic of discussion will be our MIP55 proposal MIP55c3-SP5: Interim Chief Legal Officer Kianga Daverington is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

                    "content": "Withdrawal of MIP55c3-SP5: Interim Chief Legal Officer Since submitting the above proposal on June 22, 2022 a number of developments internally and externally as of yesterday have resulted in my decision not to pursue a workforce role within MakerDAO. Thank you to all for your consideration and I look forward to being a participant in positive outcomes via other means. @Recognized-Delegates ACREinvest will continue to be an active voter on proposals under the Recognized Delegate program status quo, and will evaluate our engagement in the future relative to any modifications that may be proposed and passed by MKR holders. The core reason for this decision is the realization that MakerDAO has become, or reverted to, what I call \u201cRuneDAO\u201d which is an untenable situation in which to consider working full-time for MakerDAO. I\u2019ve given a number of speeches and rants on the subject in many places, so there\u2019s no a lot more to say in this post other than to summarize and collect the issues here for ease of reference: Internal: MakerDAO appears to be captured and entirely controlled by its Founder. A brief dynamic period of flourishing openness and organic decentralization of decision making appears to be over. Reasons for this conclusion: Excellent analysis of MakerDAO governance here by @luca_pro # 43 | First Principles of Crypto Governance This new analysis of MKR wallets is also instructive:     MKR Token Decentralization Views Strategic Finance   MKR Token Decentralization Views Commentary on data as of July 14, 2022 (embedded views will auto refresh with updated data). All views exclude Maker-owned addresses that hold MKR. Addresses known to be owned by a single entity are lumped together. Unless otherwise specified, views only include addresses/entities with at least 1 MKR token.  One aspect of decentralization in the DAO is how decentralized the MKR token is, as it represents governance power. For this reason, we put together some me\u2026     Most persuasive, however, has been the practical need for the community to capitulate to the Founder\u2019s domination of conversation and DAO resources as reflected by a couple conversations yesterday in Discord. Screen shots are attached below for those who do not frequent the main MakerDAO Discord server or follow this level of granularity in day-to-day governance. The imperative to view the Founder\u2019s influence as controlling the day and dispositive of the success or failure of DAO contributors has spread to partners, potential partners and counterparties of the DAO, which I find particularly distressing. The conversation in RWF office hours on July 20, 2022 revealed this unfortunate reality, including an example of the many ways pressure is being brought to bear on everyone to reorient themselves to serve RuneDAO. I had some choice words about this entire dynamic that for completeness should also be referenced here. As soon as the recording is available, I will link it to this thread.  1EFF57BE-638E-42B5-89C9-19D9C2DC206E1536\u00d72048 185 KB   F1554EEB-E2F3-4A96-8D05-E11DEC7AAC4B1536\u00d72048 270 KB   47CE8EEA-D574-4F4A-B5E7-A02D4A5AB9D21536\u00d72048 247 KB   C48186EC-DCF8-480B-84EA-CDDD68730BA51536\u00d72048 226 KB   F8C65161-EAD3-4300-BE82-AEEA6699BB211536\u00d72048 251 KB  As one can plainly deduce from the conversations, there is becoming (and planned for) limited viability to actively engage in the governance of MakerDAO or fulfill Core Unit responsibilities unless one gives the Founder their full attention and deference. The above reflected state of affairs is problematic for a number or reasons. When considering providing legal services in a leadership role at MakerDAO, recent external developments combined with the above radically diminishes the attractiveness of the opportunity (for any amount of money). External Clarity has greatly increased over the past 30 days from a regulatory/enforcement perspective as to how governance structures and the reality around who can and does influence outcomes for a project should be evaluated. See below for a few threads from Twitter worth a deep dive and my own summary high-level view on the matter.   twitter.com    Dane Lund \ud83d\udc7d @lund_dane  Today the DOJ and SEC brought actions against a former Coinbase employee, his brother, and his friend for allegedly trading ahead of listing announcements.  The SEC's action here is particularly relevant for securities analysis.  I will walk through the details here. \ud83e\uddf5   4:58 PM - 21 Jul 2022           83                15              twitter.com    Birdnals @BirdnalsLAW  Some quick thoughts on the SEC's action against an ex-Coinbase employee and others for selling \"crypto asset securities\" in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Complaint: sec.gov/litigation/com\u2026 \ud83e\uddf5   7:36 PM - 21 Jul 2022           41                20              twitter.com    Patrick Hansen @paddi_hansen  1/ Yesterday, after 2-3 years of consultation, discussion, amendments & negotiation, EU institutions reached an agreement on MiCA.  MiCA is probably the most important piece of crypto regulation to date.  Here is a brief overview of some key decisions \ud83d\udc47  europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-\u2026   10:14 AM - 1 Jul 2022           650                280              twitter.com    kianga.eth \ud83c\udf0d 1000 ACRE DAOs in 1000 Days @fhomoney  The calculation has become very easy.   A project that wants to preserve any measure of OG purity around permissionlessness and cypherpunk values MUST:  1) Operate as a \u201cTRULY\u201d decentralized network, and 2) Avoid global regulatory characterization as a security or stablecoin.   12:55 PM - 21 Jul 2022           2            In closing, the above in no way represents a legal conclusion or opinion on matters of law in any jurisdiction, nor the application of facts and circumstances at MakerDAO to any of these developments. The above is certainly not investment advice and does not express an opinion on whether MKR and the MakerDAO suite of products and services (however considered) are a good or bad investment for anyone in particular or in general. The above represents an individual and firm assessment of ACREinvest\u2019s particular role in the community at MakerDAO at this time, and the DeFi/Web3 community at large who we also seek to serve. I respect that others have very different opinions and may credibly disagree with the above characterizations. I have erred on the side of extreme transparency and an honest disclosure of sincerely held views to demonstrate the seriousness with which the proposal was put forward and ultimately withdrawn. Sincerely, Kianga Daverington Founder, ACREinvest Founder & Managing Partner, Daverington PLLC ",

These items should be vetted BEFORE a vote to Greenlight. We\u2019d like to see some traction on this discussion Embedding legal analysis on new governance proposals (2) We would wait for a liquid secondary market to develop and observe how it functions before Greenlighting. While at a high-level ACREinvest supports crypto-native collateral, onboarding a digital security of U.S. Government debt under any jurisdiction and governing law represents such complex issues of legal and regulatory risk that it should not be placed on the roster for further investigation at this time of apparent resource and budget reduction, and the community\u2019s rejection/push back on recent proposals to strengthen and provision for oversight and legal resources.

Has anyone considered whether now might be an opportunity to leverage the MakerDAO brand and reputation for reliability, trust, security\u2026 etc., recent favorable publicity during a painful season of defaults, losses, fraud, failure to perform, collapse, bankruptcy, etc. to in fact RAISE prices or at least hold the status quo? The problem with vault demand is not going to be fixed by lowering fees. The revenue is sorely needed. This organization needs to take a more long-term, strategic and coordinated approach to proposing system changes rather than operating in narrow reactive silos with fixed, untested assumptions. Maker Teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters - August 1, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: Cannot support this proposal given poor attention to risk management issues that cannot be solved by merely sizing the value at risk below a certain threshold and relying on the reputation of others to protect MakerDAO\u2019s interests. Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: This proposal should have been withdrawn due to disagreement and confusion within the community and among the proposers and GovAlpha as to its contents, intentions and implementation. A proposal should not be put forth that contains a declaration of how the proposers would like the world to be, but not in fact how the world is. It is not the role of Recognized Delegates to be in the workforce or responsible for management of day-to-day activities. The following outcome \u201ccoordination\u201d requirement with respect to MKR holders and Delegates is improper: \u201cco-ordinate the budget re-allocation process with Core Unit, MKR holders and Recognized Delegates.\u201d Carts are being put before the horses here, and community members seem to be taking cues directly from Rune and End Game meetings as to what the state of MakerDAO is. I believe any change in the responsibilities of Delegates with respect to a process such as this needs to be incorporated in its own on-chain vote with specificity and RFC- the whole nine yards.

There has been a tremendous amount of consternation in the community around budgets, expenses, and ensuring the protocol has sufficient runway to remain a going concern. SF took the initiative to ask the community how the protocol should be run (profitable, breakeven, at a loss but with sufficient runway) and MKR holders overwhelmingly supported operating at breakeven. SF then presented a couple paths forward, a broad cut or tactical reallocation. The community voted overwhelmingly both on the forums and on-chain to support the latter. I agree the wording of the poll was not ideal and not how we would\u2019ve written it. MKR holders and delegates have the power to allocate capital, which no other actor in Governance has. The goal for the tactical reallocation is to have fully open and transparent meetings to align on the DAO\u2019s budgeting priorities, KPIs for the Core Unit teams and therefore accountability to MKR holders, and visibility into Core Unit operations and performance.

Excited to do so again, and quote a comment we shared on the forum:  \"\u2026voting yes for \u201cStable & Volatile\u201d. An unacceptable risk of overall failure I see for MakerDAO is under utilizing its talented people!! We have the best in the business. I hate to see all the risk the community seems happy to absorb adding third parties to manage RWA on our behalf, but want to stifle so much we could be doing with our own teams and that\u2019s crypto-native. Vamos!!\"  MIP76: Makershire Redux - #45 by ACREinvest Community Greenlight Poll - RWA Arranger (BlockTower Credit) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight) Reasoning: These are difficult times in different ways. The reasons each of us have for being in this community at this moment in history are vastly diverse. One thing applies to all equally, as has been made clear in recent days: we must decide on exactly which road to travel from here. Make no mistake. The road has forked. If you don\u2019t choose a path, one will be chosen for you. I choose to accept that at the end of the day TRUST in people is all we have and the only foundation on which to build a new future. Code is written by humans after all. AI can\u2019t save us (haven\u2019t you been watching Westworld?). It is certain death for those we most want to help if individually we hide from the world, believing blindly in crypto or DeFi salvation. I see my role at MakerDAO as one for tackling the BIG systemic legacy problems. For that we need people who understand those problems and have a vision for realistic solutions. The BT presentation today Collateral Onboarding Call #47 | BlockTower Credit (Arranger) AMA combined with his wonderful essay Everything is Broken - by Daniel McCormick gave me the confidence in @humancapitol - specifically - to overcome my initial pessimism that now isn\u2019t the right time to proceed further down the RWA road without necessary governance fixes in place. A YES vote here is going to help us along the right path to what MakerDAO is uniquely positioned to do at a crucial time. ~ Kianga Daverington on behalf of ACREinvest Maker Teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: And the band played on!

Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: The specter of RuneDAO was just too strong on this one for us to participate. If one reviews the flow of comments and how sentiment is influenced by a \u201ccertain large token holder\u201d (a euphemism I keep hearing lately when it seems everyone ELSE knows Rune is being referred to\u2026because such is said by people in chat on a zoom call (for example) whilst the speak professes concerns about the token holder\u2019s privacy (???) - we have no ACTUAL idea), it paints a sad picture of governance-as-theater at MakerDAO.    MIP40c3-SP73: Modify Core Unit Budget (EVENTS-001)   Your options if opposed to this proposal are either lobby enough MKR to defeat the proposal (which seems difficult given Rune\u2019s support for it, but there\u2019s a lot of delegates with his MKR and some may be willing to oppose this proposal), or find a way to get the author to withdraw the proposal.   The comment above was stated after Rune came out in favor of the offboarding. He subsequently changed in mind and informed the community of his support and voila! the offboarding is defeated.     MIP40c3-SP73: Modify Core Unit Budget (EVENTS-001) Archive       Don\u2019t have time to read all the details, but I think that we are seeing decent progress on a broad and unified budget reduction strategy and so I am no longer in favor of abruptly offboarding this core unit.  As others are suggesting, we should wait with retiring the core unit until a proper attempt has been made to consolidate events under growth and marketing, and I think it should be considered to have a corresponding modest budget increase, if necessary and with clear KPIs and results expect\u2026     Our sentiment on this vote was expressed here in context of a discussion about the lack of human capital management function at the DAO, which is extremely problematic under the current actual state of centralized power.    Signal Request: MKR Pro-Rata Vesting Community Sentiment Poll   I am also troubled that Delegates are looked to as the HR department as well which in practice for some seems to be doing what a \u201ccertain large token holder\u201d is saying either privately or publicly on the Forum (as was the case with how the DAO should handle the Events CU offboarding - leading ACREinvest to abstain on that vote and otherwise distance our platform from engaging in what we view as management activities, HR and workforce administration).

Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer) Reasoning: No new business can be responsibly greenlit in this environment of uncertainty - even chaos - and live efforts to massively cut resources, offboard crucial CUs (such as Strategic Finance) and change the entire governance and operating structure of the DAO. We missed the vote for two polls ending August 25, 2022 due to user error (ID 854 and 855). Somehow they escaped our review of what needed to be voted on and when. The decision probably would have been to abstain on both. Organizational disfunction is forcing teams to improvise in order to continue executing their mandates as well as advance action in the overall best interest of the DAO and MKR holders. We recognize that and commend the effort. However, deciding on a target spend level in the absence of progress as to DAO restructuring (if that\u2019s what happening) and/or strategic alignment doesn\u2019t make sense. It could be that those with enough voting power to decide the big issues are happy to make a call on this downstream item, in which case we defer to the winning vote as to what the spend level should be. As for the Collateral Onboarding request, the evolution of this request was just plain confusing and there hasn\u2019t been enough time to research all the tangents, consider all the angles and then truly this level of management decision is not the proper tasking for Delegates in the current governance model. Accordingly, abstain would have been the best vote for us as we will do going forward when decision are put forward to a vote that we think reflect or react in unhealthy ways to the sub-optimal operating situation for the whole organization. We have come to think of Abstaining as a kind of quiet protest that is mostly symbolic, but perhaps (hopefully) may put some other kind of social pressure to raise the bar on what the community collectively will consider acceptable as the status quo.

In this case, the higher debt ceilings are attractive and being responsive to the specific request from the Decentraland community is a good decision.

Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Voting Yes because GovAlpha has done an excellent job drafting and vetting this MIP set in the community. ACREinvest does not feel at all conflicted. We did not ask for nor did we author the proposal, but can confirm its passing would have the intended result of making long-term orientation toward contribution to MakerDAO in this role more tenable/attractive.

Doing our part to hold this DAO together. Pay the people. GovAlpha has such a difficult job and its people have done incredibly over a very challenging year. Wearing many hats, contributing outside their specific mandate at times and holding this community together - plus going above and beyond on a personal level.

Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: SH should not be a separate core unit.

We hope that in the end, this kind of openness and adversarial engagement should produce better results for society than the old-school methods I believe are alive and well here at MakerDAO. But to your point, there is absolutely a limit to our participation in a community that diverges from our core values and what we believe is a positive force in the wider DeFi ecosystem, world and for its participants. ACREinvest is coming up to that line and once it is crossed, all the trolls here will be better able to enjoy the lovely harmony that Dear Leader obedience brings even if in MY OPINION it destroys something that could have been truly remarkable for the world. I\u2019ll keep standing for a different ideal and continue speaking out to protect the interests of those who are silenced here or not at liberty for various reasons to speak truth to power, and for as long as this Delegate Contract is active and MKR holders continue their delegation. ~ Kianga ",

But telling a delegate who continues to have community support from delegation, who continues to comply with the delegate rules, and who meaningfully explains their position to \u201cgo away\u201d strikes me as much more contrary to the spirit of an open DAO than protesting a policy direction by abstaining. @ACREinvest , I do wish that instead of just waiting for divine intervention to bring regulatory consciousness to the DAO, you would propose a MIP.

With respect to what taking regulatory risk seriously for the whole of the organization looks like and coming up with an informed consensus on what may be required to operate lawfully in all jurisdictions, we acknowledge that our purist view seems to be out-of-step with the controlling views of the community.

Our reason is that we\u2019ve taken time to evaluate our views about MakerDAO, and our role, responsibilities and potential liability as a Recognized Delegate in light of this new regime. Our opposition to the Endgame plan remains steadfast. Both the manner in which it was forced onto the community and flagrant disregard for its many fatal flaws render the result a complete and total tragedy. We are in agreement with the critiques very well detailed in a number of posts by other Recognized Delegates and prominent members of the community including:     LFWs Endgame Commentary Governance       Feels like this should go without saying with that title. But to be explicit: these thoughts and comments represent my personal position, rather than GovAlpha\u2019s.    LFWs Endgame Commentary  Aims  Highlight perceived risks with the Endgame plan that may have gone under-examined. Encourage changes in how the Endgame plan is realised to avoid the situation where Maker is locked into doing or continuing to do something that is not working. Suggest simplifications to the proposed Endgame structure.  \u2026         A16z Endgame Thoughts Governance       Overview  In the spirit of @LongForWisdom\u2019s thorough Endgame Commentary, we wanted to publicly clarify our thinking surrounding the overall strategic direction for MakerDAO, and the Endgame Plan\u2019s role in it going forward.  As many others have pointed out, the Endgame Plan contains a number of innovative ideas, but the proposals are complex and involve interlocking concepts that will dramatically change MakerDAO moving forward. We deeply appreciate all of @Rune\u2019s efforts to this point, and in re\u2026         London Business School Delegate Platform Delegates       We are voting NO to the Endgame Plan Prelaunch MIP Set and set out our rationale below. Our response focuses on a critique of the Endgame Plan rather than its implementation details as set out in the sub-proposals to this MIP set.  Summary and context  We understand that the Endgame Plan proposed by Rune is a roadmap for Maker to achieve maximal growth and decentralisation over the next 10+ years of its operation and bundles together a number of interrelated components, some of which we consider\u2026     Essay by @luca_pro # 47 | Tribes & Endgames: DAOs Stretching Themselves Tweet thread by @Hasu https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1584879485748678656?s=20&t=HJa_c-ERXHx0fuqASQrjkQ Despite its success in the Governance polling vote, the evidence that the Endgame plan does NOT have consensus approval or buy-in from the MakerDAO community-at-large is overwhelming. Exhibit A Informal poll on support for Rune's Endgame proposal We also cannot know from the on-chain vote what the views are of a huge portion of MKR holders who for various reasons do not or cannot participate in on-chain voting. Exhibit B Tweet Thread by @SebVentures https://twitter.com/SebVentures/status/1584875892555268096?s=20&t=HJa_c-ERXHx0fuqASQrjkQ Accordingly, we have determined that the outcome of the Endgame vote DOES NOT reflect the decision of the actual community and therefore we do not attribute the views and approach taken by the Endgame MIP set to be dispositive for the whole of MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization. We commend and applaud and tip all the hats to the full-time contributors, Core Unit members and Facilitators in particular who continue to execute their mandates during trying times in accordance with the outcome of Governance decisions, as well they should.  \u201cNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds\u201d  Since we have some skin in the game at this point, and believe it might still be possible that MakerDAO is in FACT beyond the reach of powers that want to centralize control for their own ends, we are taking liberties to continue our unique mode of \u201cprotest participation.\u201d This will necessarily mean our active visible engagement will be significantly reduced, but we will be watching closely. In order to continue our support for the community members and MKR holders who would like to see MakerDAO lead in: (1) truly decentralizing power, (2) implementing conflicts of interest standards and other compliance measures that protect the core protocol value and its sustainability, and (3) encouraging participatory leadership and inclusion of all ecosystem stakeholders (including DAI holders) we have decided to HOLD SPACE in honor of those who journeyed before us and for the future many would like to see by renewing our Recognized Delegate contract. Our stance regarding governance votes remains unchanged. Accordingly, as previously stated we:     ACREinvest:  will not support new Executives unless and until there is a clearly expressed commitment via on-chain vote to prioritize a new status quo where MakerDAO\u2019s operating structure has a researched and informed basis on which to conclude it is in compliance with any laws in any jurisdiction to which it may be subject, if any.   Any polls that may be offered in the future will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but we will refrain from casting a vote for as long as we believe the overall direction of MakerDAO to be unfocused and unresourced with respect to the totality of its legal and compliance responsibilities, including conflicts of interest standards and other checks and balances necessary for the protection of individual community members and all stakeholders in this important DeFi infrastructure.

You will find some details set forth here: https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP24#changes That said, we may have been the inspiration for an amendment to these rules now in RFC MIP4c2-SP29: Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics The above reflects the proper way for altering the behavior of participants through a governance designed and approved process that can implement incentive changes. There should be a healthy amount of respect by all community members regarding the rules all agree to participate under. When it comes to disagreeing with the manner in which someone chooses to engage, this is absolutely fine and encouraged, but your disapproval should not be conflated with that someone having taken improper or inappropriate action. Any compensation paid to ACREinvest is compensation earned no matter how anyone feels about it. You will note that compensation requires participation in voting and communicating reasons for voting, and is tied to the amount of MKR delegated. Our decisions regarding voting are understood to have an impact on compensation, whereas participation in the community and governance can still occur whilst NOT voting. Our Delegate Contract from the past year of service expired at the end of November. No MKR has migrated to the new contract which does not signal an active removal of delegation, and is often a process that can take some time for MKR holders to notice and move delegation to the new contract. We do not know if our current delegators under the expired contract will find it interesting to re-delegate to a Recognized Delegate who is not currently voting. There are a number of Recognized Delegates who do not vote often or communicate and therefore do not receive compensation, but have MKR delegated to them and are still Recognized Delegates per the rules of MakerDAO. Hope that provides some clarity on the subject. Thanks for your interest and taking the time to share your thoughts. ",

                    "content": "New for 2023: ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE As of January 10, 2023, our Founder Kianga Daverington will be posting on the Forum as @DaveringtonPLLC while we transition the firm to a purely administrative service on behalf of a decentralized group of contributors who are members of the ACRE DAOs network (Autonomous Communities for Regenerative Economies). Across the DeFi ecosystem governance is mostly an unpaid privilege expected to be performed by the owners of governance crypto assets. MakerDAO is among a handful of large projects that do provide compensation for governance services through the Recognized Delegate program we\u2019ve had the pleasure to participate in since December 2021. Internal and external events of the past year have exposed shortcomings in the current state of decentralized protocol governance and the urgent need to try new things. WE CAN HAVE NICE THINGS ACREinvest is doing our part with today\u2019s announcement and accelerating long-held plans to provide services through decentralized groups of contributors. An \u201cOrigin Story\u201d page has been added to our website for those who want the full back-story. We are sharing here this concept drawing from July 2021 to hopefully illustrate the alignment we perceive has occurred between this platform and the MakerDAO community with last week\u2019s announcements about changes in the Endgame plan and implementation.  ACRE DAO_Acre VNS_Acre of America_RHOZ1920\u00d71440 257 KB  In particular, we are pleased to see a prominent emphasis on legal and compliance issues.    Endgame updates & link for Endgame call tonight at 2pm ET/8pm CET   Compliance and short term products Another set of useful improvements is compliance and legal resilience from leveraging the increased knowledge we have as it relates to various legal and regulatory risks and opportunities. This additional risk reduction allows to move faster with certain products and launches with the safety of following best practice on defi frontend compliance. This in turn puts us in a better position to develop strong long term solutions for unbreakable decentralization.   We are also very supportive of postponing tokenomics changes and suspending the POVE implementation. Accordingly, ACREinvest is preparing to RESUME VOTING on behalf of our delegated MKR holders with decisions powered by an anon decentralized collective of NFT holders (the ACREinvest ReFi Collective) who are passionate about the power of DeFi to regenerate finance for the benefit of the \u201creal\u201d world and all of her people. Further information about participation in this group may be obtained by sending us a message on Blockscan Chat to acreinvest.eth. Communications should be from NON-doxxed ethereum addresses and you should not include any personally identifiable information in your message. The Collective through ACREinvest has retained @DaveringtonPLLC for advice on how to operate in this unconventional manner. Kianga Daverington as Principal Attorney @DaveringtonPLLC is empowered to oversee, veto or override decisions of the Collective with respect to ACREinvest\u2019s voting and communications for reasons of illegality or reputational risk in her sole discretion. OUR NEW DELEGATE CONTRACT IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS Our Delegate Contract was renewed in November 2022. If you previously delegated MKR to us, we would welcome your re-delegation to the new contract and if are a MKR holder that was not with us in 2022, we invite you to join us now! What do we hope to accomplish with these organizational changes? ACREinvest is pioneering a new concept for professional governance delegation that is rapidly scalable organically through the same network effects and social incentives that DeFi protocols themselves enjoy. You can see in our concept drawing above that we\u2019ve been thinking in terms of subDAOs and internal community tokens for quite some time. We believe the changes we are implementing in 2023 greatly complement the pre-game scoping work and Constitution development needs of MakerDAO. By anchoring toward completely anon attribution for our decisions, we hope to filter out distracting and divisive political dynamics while creating a safe space for all to engage without insecurity or fear of backlash. Until now, Recognized Delegates and their decisions have been attributable to individuals and firms whose identities you know. This is a strong basis for trust and credibility. However, we think it will be interesting to flip this model on its head. Let\u2019s fool around and find out if a decentralized anon group can gain your trust purely on the basis of track record and official communications. In our instance, of course, the reputation and particular experience set on which this Delegate Platform began continues on in some form with the new structure. We will update our initial profile information above and appearing on the Voting Portal in due course. From our new Origin Story page:  ACRE DAOs - A GLOBAL NETWORK In 2023, we are activating a new model for DeFi protocol layer operations where the workforce needed to execute governance functions are compensated permissionlessly based upon the collective success of its network members\u2019 contributions across the DeFi ecosystem. This approach reduces ACREinvest (the firm) to a purely administrative agent optimized to pass-through payments as trustee for the benefit of individual contributors doing open finance work. Our solution includes a spoke-hub global distribution of communities (subDAOs) connected by (1) their shared adoption of a single social currency - the $ACRE ERC-20 token, (2) multi-stakeholder governance of a permissionless income protocol (DOER Money DAO) for the benefit of $ACRE earners, and (3) a Charitable Remainder Trust legal entity structure.  Please note communications to ACREinvest as Recognized Delegate should be done by public mention on the Forum or Discord. Contacting Kianga Daverington directly should be done via @DaveringtonPLLC on the Forum or Discord kianga#9300. ",

Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Burn 0.5 million DAI worth of MKR 2nd choice: Do not burn any MKR Reasoning: This is an important technical solution with many use cases expected for future implementation. We would like to see it tested live and in the wild now. We are not otherwise supportive of burning MKR in line with the historical norm. Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: We are abstaining on all polls that deal with Core Unit budgets and off-boardings directly tied to the fallout from the initial Endgame plan approval and resulting workforce turmoil. We defer to the decisions of others closer to the discussion and planning on how the current Endgame vision will chart a positive and successful course for the future. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject both changes Reasoning: We oppose this proposal which was launched as a political attack against ACREinvest to intimidate and penalize us financially for lawful conduct that the proposing Recognized Delegate found personally objectionable. As many know, we were in the minority with respect to our views on the proposed Endgame MIP set and related matters. Our objections were sincerely held. We believed a full consideration of our points was mission critical for this community and those with the power to implement changes. Initially abstaining and, later, ceasing entirely from all voting and Executive support were permissible ways we could draw attention to our concerns. We are pleased to resume voting today because after several months we have been heard: ACREinvest Delegate Platform - #85 by ACREinvest Anyone supporting this proposal will be encouraging behaviour that allows a powerful and influential FEW to target those who disagree with measures disguised as for the common good, but in fact are narrowly politically motivated to suppress dissent. MIP4c2-SP29: Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics - #5 by ACREinvest We agree with sentiments Rune shared on yesterday\u2019s DVC call*: Delegates should not have the power to control the terms of their compensation, especially when that power can be abused in ways that threaten the integrity of the system by petty actions from its most trusted community stewards. *Anyone can view yesterday\u2019s (January 11, 2023), previous and future meetings once uploaded to the Open Decentralized Voter Committee YouTube Playlist Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: Unintended consequences for implementing this the wrong way could be significant in a very sensitive area touching DAO contributor potential legal liabilities. Without the full picture being understood and subject to a much more transparent and accountable diligence process and legal review we do not support implementation in pieces. ",

Polls: Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: This collectively observed break is very important for the resilience and health of the human-members of the community. The core workforce works extremely hard all year. The opportunity to downshift and have a different set of expectations apply should continue when the rest of humanity is also slowing down and retreating from work. Teams are well able to manage emergencies or any surprises under the status quo. Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: In this time of transition and processes going away with uncertainty about what, when and how new Endgame frameworks will replace them, we are persuaded by Patrick_J\u2019s comments that MIP14 is an available process that may prove more useful in the future than it has thus far. MIP4c4-SP2: MIP14 Repeal - #4 by Patrick_J Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Good clean up. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Useful modification to make the current available MIPs more responsive to the needs of the community during this time of transition to a pre-Endgame short-term stance. Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Abstain Reasoning: We are abstaining on all polls that deal with Core Unit budgets and off-boardings directly tied to the fallout from the initial Endgame plan approval and resulting workforce turmoil. We defer on this matter to the decisions of others who have been closer to the planning for how the current Endgame vision will chart a positive and successful course for the future.

Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: All new business and proposals that seek to implement new workforce structures should be put on hold pending guidance that will be forthcoming in Q2 following community discussion on a set of pre-Endgame proposals coming soon. We understand short-term operating rules and priorities to guide the community over the next 2 years will be submitted for ratification by MKR vote at the end of Q1. Today we saw a number of exciting MIPs introduced, including this one on Work Proposal Frameworks MIP98 - The Work Proposal Framework, that we should focus on developing for the fair use and equal access by all who would like to provide services to or fulfill needs of the DAO. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: We are generally in favor of this onboard, but lack the internal expertise at this time to directly evaluate the technical aspects. Accordingly, we defer to the judgement of others among Delegates and Core Units who have expressed support and whom we trust on these matters. Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We very much support the spirit and intention of this proposal. However, it is more likely to clutter the landscape and potentially conflict with or distract from efforts already underway by persons deeply engaged day-to-day on the problems identified. We understand short-term operating rules and priorities to guide the community over the next 2 years will be submitted for ratification by MKR vote at the end of Q1. Today we saw a number of exciting MIPs introduced, including this one on Work Proposal Frameworks MIP98 - The Work Proposal Framework. RWA presents a host of issues best treated comprehensively and with the right composition of dedicated Core resources (Facilitator DAOs) and Ecosystem Actors and/or subDAOs. In any case, the work and approach should be highly and expertly coordinated to follow the DAO-wide Endgame Framework and Scopes development processes. Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We are very excited about this proposal and potential to work with Yearn on strengthening crypto-native strategies. However, our across-the-board view is that no new business should be approved until we understand short-term operating rules and priorities that will guide the community over the next 2 years. New pre-Endgame stance MIPs are being introduced this month for community discussion and ratification by MKR vote at the end of Q1 2023. Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Abstain Reasoning: We lack the internal expertise at this time to understand and directly evaluate the technical aspects of this proposal. Accordingly, we defer to the judgement of others among Delegates and Core Units who have expressed support and whom we trust on these matters. ",

The most important risk to manage urgently is MakerDAO\u2019s own capacity to engage expertly with \u201cReal World\u201d counterparties and manage those relationships and their risks extremely well. If from a human resources perspective this can\u2019t be done in a timely fashion, there is too much risk on the table to continue. We consider that market confidence and reputation/trust deterioration in Gemini are as important as triggers for the worst case scenario as are poor legal structures, potential regulatory violations (SEC allegations and penalties sought are VERY serious) and what collateral is where backing GUSD. Speaking of reputation, we think maintaining the PSM at this difficult time may provide some relief to those who are victims of the contagion and this is a role MakerDAO should be proud to serve. Accordingly, we should go to some lengths to preserve what could still be a positive outcome for MakerDAO and ALL as originally hoped IF we can manage the situation well. Continuing with good outcomes, however, requires resources engaged to do the difficult substantive work. We have this invitation from Tyler today:    GUSD & MakerDAO Partnership Update   We are also happy to consider implementing additional processes for increased transparency (e.g., regular meetings with core teams, joining community calls, and other mechanisms to promote transparency and provide needed information) if the community would find it valuable.   Let\u2019s do it. Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) - January 16, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: We vote YES on reducing the tout to 0, making the PSM attractive for arbitrageurs to reduce MakerDAO exposure if market conditions support such trade. We understand from community discussion that relatively little is likely to exit organically. If reducing the position significantly and quickly is desired, Maker would most likely need to appoint a real-world legal entity to act as a counterparty to Gemini who could redeem directly for USD. This presents a HOST of \u201creal world\u201d issues. The bankruptcy of Gemini is only but ONE of many practical problems for MakerDAO in managing the situation. As a non-legal person, MakerDAO cannot directly handle fiat and has unknown & unknowable standing should any legal process be required to access or enforce remedies against any of (1) Gemini or (2) a 3rd party permitted to hold title to any Maker assets (such as USD redeemed for GUSD) or (3) any bank or custodian that would have actual possession of Maker assets (on behalf of Gemini or a 3rd party engaged by Maker). We note that $MKR holders have neither approved a 3rd party nor has an agreement with any 3rd party to act on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf with respect to holding title to protocol assets in this case, maintaining custody or use or transfer of those assets, or converting $GUSD via Gemini to USD, or otherwise. Per discussion with GovAlpha in Office Hours yesterday, we understand another poll would be needed for further MakerDAO-directed action to actively reduce exposure. ",

MakerDAO should reinforce the message and act consistently with the intention that it is a protocol operating for use by institutions and professional ecosystem participants. For access by retail and others operating at small scale, focus should be to support L2 and third-party app integrations that serve downstream/upstream/cross-stream(?) users. Income projections, strategy for expense management, marketing and partnership development should have this focus on professional actors as a central guiding theme. We are also thinking about \u201creal world\u201d compliance frames that would be most appropriate IF MakerDAO was a CeFi firm, which of course it is NOT. Nevertheless, we can still be aware and distinguish between responsibilities and features that may be appropriate for serving retail end users vs sophisticated parties or other protocols whether or not externally enforced rules can or should apply.

The latest news this morning of troubles at Gemini shared here \u201cGUSD & MakerDAO Partnership Update - #12 by DaveringtonPLLC\u201d further underscores the importance of implementing some kind of risk management action. However, it is noted and should be understood by all that this change alone is only one action among many that may be appropriate to take at this time. As we communicated at the time of the relevant Poll:     ACREinvest:  Reasoning: We vote YES on reducing the tout to 0, making the PSM attractive for arbitrageurs to reduce MakerDAO exposure if market conditions support such trade.

ACREinvest continues to support dialogue, engagement and strengthening the Gemini partnership in some form for as long as that remains sensible. That said, we do not have confidence MakerDAO is well positioned today to expertly negotiate the challenges and issues presented. This is a worry. Finally, we acknowledge a concern raised in the Governance Discord channel about the following language in the Executive Spell, and would like to address any questions folks might have as to how we were comfortable voting so quickly given this odd inclusion.  Executive spell text1284\u00d71162 116 KB  Answer: We regularly attend Core Unit weekly public meetings for the express purpose of staying current and having a deeper context from which to evaluate and execute Delegate responsibilities. PECU members can attest that either members of ACRE DAOs and/or @DaveringtonPLLC joins them often on Tuesdays just to listen in and learn - including during the period when we were not engaged in active voting. @GFXlabs and @flipflopflapdelegate can also confirm since we regularly see them at CU meetings as well. @brianmcmichael shared an explanation about the Spell text in question to the group in Discord and posted a link to this detailed description.

There should be no approvals at this stage of isolated Declarations of Intent, and non-critical ideas addressed to a future potential state of MakerDAO. Work of a prospective nature needs to be considered in context with the organizational restructuring and alignment attempt underway via the Endgame Plan. A decision on the substance proposed here naturally can only FOLLOW a determination on other key strategic choices regarding retail users and MakerDAO\u2019s social orientation toward its stakeholders. If approved to go forward, the Endgame Constitution radically shifts how technical work can be initiated and who/which contributing entities have responsibility and accountability for deliverables and maintenance. We see a general lack of sensitivity in the community to the amplification of spiraling chaos being unleashed by the continuing approval of things without any concern or regard for the organizational ORDER MakerDAO must urgently put in place. Without raising the bar on upholding the integrity of process, we are lost on the road to the Endgame even before we start. As for the BURN, specifically, we remain unconvinced of its efficacy and appropriateness in 2023 with rather substantial other dynamics at work to support a value proposition for holding MKR. The community\u2019s emotional attachment to the burn mechanism from days of yore needs to evolve with the times (as has everything else to do with MakerDAO). Ratification Poll for Amend MIP62 to Allow for Changing Communication Responsibilities (MIP4c2-SP33) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: Approve and appreciate the diligence and attention to ORDER through these kinds of governance documentation updates. Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process (MIP4c2-SP30) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes Reasoning: These are thoughtful improvements based on experience, and very useful to ratify now nothwithstanding that processes may be overwritten, redefined or refined in the pregame Constitutional Scopes work. It\u2019s critical we maintain the governance rules as they HAVE been ratified and not neglect order for the sake of what may be presumed to come online in the future. Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We are consistent in voting no on all new business during this quarter when the future state of organizational priorities, resource allocation and workforce responsibilities is unknown/unconfirmed. The Endgame Constitution MIPs scheduled for a vote next month - if approved - will put a new steady state in place. It\u2019s regretful this vote was rushed despite warnings from the community that the timing was bad and success more likely with additional time spent in RFC. If this poll fails, we hope Cogent will revisit opportunities with MakerDAO if there\u2019s still a match as the Real World Asset Scope Framework comes online and evolves. Audit and Review Work for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Engineering Resource for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: On both above polls we are voting no in an attempt to protect the integrity of the proposed Endgame Plan, which claims to solve for the corrosive culture of privately negotiated special treatment without appropriate safeguards and protections for conflicts of interest and self dealing. Decisions that happen without transparency and scrutiny and input via the processes, methods and expectations codified through onchain MKR votes lack legitimacy. A thread of our specific comments when this initiative was first recently announced can be found HERE and HERE. It would really be tragic if the new era of Endgame being sold to protect the organization and its stakeholders from such machinations, is actually launched with the very thing it claims to defeat being front and center thus contaminating the waters for what might otherwise be a good idea. We cannot tell. There has been little objective review, zero legal or regulatory risk analysis and the design contemplates an organizational structure that does not exist. Anything to do with Phoenix Labs and Spark should be paused full stop and proposed for approvals through an appropriate PUBLIC and ratified governance process.

While the cost of increased DSR usage in the short term might net-out a large portion of the revenue increases from the proposed higher stability fees, we see an important tail wind developing. The exciting takeaway is that the DSR story is driving demand for and adoption of DAI as a treasury diversification asset for large decentralized projects/communities. There are many levers to activate as this trend accelerates which could lead to success across multiple other priorities, such as the concept of a DeFi-wide \u201crisk-free rate\u201d anchored by the MakerDAO protocol.

The budget is insufficient and certainly there is not time to procure and implement any such advice for an April launch of anything. No one acting for Phoenix Labs can obtain legal advice for the benefit of MakerDAO. However, we trust the proposers will conduct their activities in good faith as stewards of the whole (since they are currently separately engaged in other trusted roles within the ecosystem). All should understand that to the extent there is not an adequate structural, legal or practical distinction between what Phoenix Labs operators are doing and the Core of MakerDAO, there may be no good enforcement mechanism or governance mechanism at this time to manage the conflicts of interest or other issues that may arise. Decrease the RETH-A Dust Parameter - March 6, 2023 (thread) Voted: No Reasoning: We are consistent in voting no on lowering Dust Parameters due to the risk it may be perceived externally as targeting retail users in the absence of the larger comprehensive strategy and risk management implementation to be developed through the Endgame Constitution Scope Frameworks.

But any system (even a decentralized one based on smart contracts) is only as good as the people who take care to perform their unique and individual functions well.

We expect SEC will move against Circle and USDC on the back of this weekend\u2019s spectacle. Signature is in trouble as well and at a minimum Signet is likely to be permanently suspended. As the contagion spreads, expect politics (including geo-political dynamics from a U.S. perspective) to be a defining force for what happens next and to whom. There will be no bailouts, but bail-ins.

We understand that the approval of the Constitutional MIP set will override and make obsolete many of the MIPs included in this set of polls. For the existing workforce business-as-usual MIPs we have approved the highest budget requests and otherwise defaulted to trusting these teams\u2019 assessment of their needs given their track record in the community, and recognizing the instability and stress of the even greater uncertainty they will be facing if the Constitution vote fails. We are very pleased to support the proposals that appointment specific Facilitators who have already served the project so excellently, and technical adjustments made for teams using business entities. Our consistent view this quarter with respect to new business has been to defer those approvals until the Endgame pregame structure has been ratified and its better way of doing all the things can be implemented. In the event of the Constitution vote failing, the project will be in an even worse place to have already approved the new business initiatives being proposed during this transition. We provide some additional color on specific votes below where relevant. Ratification Poll for the Constitution MIP Set - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes We look forward to the Endgame Era and hope this vote ends with an overwhelming majority of available MKR expressing support. We first become open to more actively engage in the Endgame planning in January after the successful Endgame Prelaunch vote last year, which we did not support. Once the first draft of the Constitution was posted we were encouraged and even excited about what was possible through its upgrade of the MakerDAO purpose, form and function. We have expressed interest in seeing a Regenerative Finance CVC along the lines proposed by ACRE DAOs @goodnews created during the pregame. Kianga @DaveringtonPLLC recently joined an Endgame Decentralized Vote Committee meeting to talk about the evolution of our views and why we see so much promise in the new direction. We are convinced this is the gwei and will be in the best interest of all stakeholders, including and most importantly DAI holders present and future.

We do not have sufficient information to form a view nor have we seen explicit discussion that makes the case in favor of this increase or removal of DC-IAM, either as a response to recent market turmoil or more generally in the absence of the Constitution MIPs failure.

UltraSchuppi - YouTube  Delegate Statement  Growth over Profit Despite already being considered as a blue chip in the DeFi-ecosystem, we believe Maker is still super early in the game and we should absolutely focus on growing our footprint instead of being profitable.  Decentralization We are far away from being decentralized. That\u2019s okay. Just to give you some idea how we feel where we should go to  Multiple Core Units caring about the same domain is desirable. Just having one Growth CU is not where we should be on the long run, same for CUs doing engineering (we are a lot better already here, but also far from perfect) We need a lot more collateral types. We already overdid this with crypoassets (onboarded collateral which was just not worth the effort/cost), but we think there are a lot of RWA we can onboard on the on the long run There has been some talking about SEC-compliance and other US-focused regulatory stuff. we are totally not saying that is bad, but we are missing the notion of Maker being a trans-national thing. Delegation helped us a lot on letting execs pass. But it also revealed that a single delegate/whale can flip any vote. We need more voter participation and for that most probably a lot more delegates to make this happen.   Trust We are usually trusting in people, and not caring a lot about KPIs. We know that this is bad, but it worked well enough for us. We think we do need some standardized way on how we go with accounting, budgets and all of that. Probably not urgent now, but if we don\u2019t prepare it will be too late at some point and everything will be a total mess. We already see traces here.  About us We are a group of MKR holders who prefer to stay unknown. We have been following @ultraschuppi for more than a year now and believe we can help the protocol by serving as a Recognized Delegate especially because we are not traceable. As for all human interactions a real human is needed, we are going to have @ultraschuppi as an advisor to our platform, empowered with interacting with all other parts of the DAO. Onchain activity will be done by us. In general, we will go with the advice we get from him. As a rule of thumb: We will vote in favor for every exec that gets promoted on chain by the Governance Facilitators that does not feel dangerous to the protocol even if that exec contains changes that we voted against in the previous onchain poll.  Conflicts of Interest We hold positions on several DeFi projects, but not to the same degree as we hold MKR. We are not participating in any other DAO and do not plan to do that. We have read and agree to the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of liability By delegating to us, you acknowledge and agree that we participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.  Edits   2021-11-07T23:00:00Z: added ENS-Delegation to conflicts of Interest  2021-12-12T23:00:00Z: changed ENS name for delegate contract, added twitter, removed RocketChat, added Meet your delegate-link    2022-07-13T22:00:00Z: updated to new delegate contract, removed section about 2nd delegate contract (no one ever delegated to it, pointless to recreate - it will expire in some days)  2023-01-20T23:00:00Z: platform taken over from @ultraschuppi + update  ",

This is an interesting idea which allows for different styles and preferences of delegation - I wonder if there are other ways that we will see votes broken down and how that will inform delegation and voting processes in the future.

Aside from that, ETH-B has shown that low-LR vaults provide a good income and are attracting different customers. Nice to see we finally make a move into this direction with WBTC as well.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A Parameter Adjustments (thread) voted Yes Allowing more leverage is good, even if it comes with a lower SF. But I think we should make stablecoin<->DAI-conversation is cheap as possible anyway (remember: we are not making any more money with the PSMs starting tomorrow). I have some doubts the new DC will even get maxed out, but those changes make sense to me.  NS-DROP Covenant Modification (thread) voted Abstain We are in a bit of turmoil in the RWA area right now. As the whole domain is clearly outside of my expertise a PPG around this area would certainly help me a lot on making decisions. Reading the thread, there is a lot of topics outside of the distinct topic the Signal Request. I hope we get this ship back into safe waters soon.  Recognised Delegate Compensation Increase (thread) voted Abstain As stated in my Meet your Delegate call I think delegates should not decide on their compensation on their own. I believe MIP61 is a step into the right direction - using a shortcut for trying it out for 3 months is not offbeat, but I would like to lay this into the hands of non-delegate voters to decide if we should go this path or not. If this poll is not passing onchain, it will not change anything for me personally.  Increase the WSTETH-A Debt Ceiling (thread) voted Yes WSTEth as a collateral has been a nice addition to our portfolio, seeing that it got adopted by customers so quickly is good to see. We need to keep up with the demand (and it provides some solid income as well).  DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Parameter Adjustments (thread) voted Yes Being an impatient person, I cannot wait for the moment where we can do a strong promise on DAI-Borrowers at AAVE to be sure the rates are safu. Increasing the line is a first good step into this direction. The D3M is one of the most important things we have shipped this year which is the reason I am holding this wonderful NFT from @aburban90   Community Greenlight Poll - MDI (MD Irradiance LLC) (thread) voted Abstain Like most of the topics around collateral onboarding in general and RWA specially I just don\u2019t feel informed enough to make a call here. In a more general sense, I guess it makes a lot more sense to first to some eval around efforts needed, profitability, risk by smart people before bringing the topic to MKR holders to decide.  Community Greenlight Poll - OHM (Olympus DAO) (thread) voted No Same as with MDI, but adding here: @MakerMan and @PaperImperium made some convincing comments why this probably not a good idea to have in the first place (here and here) ",

Being able to have smoothly running liquidations is going to be really important on the next market downturn.  Rates Proposal (thread) votes Yes Despite appetite for DAI-from-WBTC has cooled down a lot in the last week (but not special compared to other ilks), I still think it is reasonable to increase the rates here.

Let\u2019s move on.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40)  (thread) voted Yes Essentially a renewal of the currently running budget. No surprises. I think we should get a standardized and mandatory system in place (reference) - this would not only help the teams to focus on their core competencies but also increase visibility for all stakeholders.  Ratification Poll for Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) (thread) votes Yes The collateral onboarding process is not ideal in general, but it is great that we get something new for RWA now. I expect more iterations on it in the future, but this is a good start for sure.  Ratification Poll for Adding Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit, SAS-001 (thread) voted Yes This Core Unit has a meaningful mission and a capable team for executing it. The only thing that I do not like is the retroactive vesting - I know this is not the first time and @wouter made some good points why we should do that. There need to be good reasons when this is applied but my subjective assessment is aligned with the procedure here.  Ratification Poll for the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) (thread) voted Yes A great addition to our existing Core Unit stack and I am really happy to have @psychonaut as Deputy Facilitator in here as well.  Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) (thread) voted Yes This Core Unit application has been the cause of some sleepless nights and making a decision on it has been the hardest tasks as a new delegate so far. I have been talking with a lot of people from the community, from existing Core Units and from the Deco team. The discussions, opinions and assessments on this application are wide-ranging and frankly speaking: If I would be just a casual voter, I would probably just abstain. I don\u2019t want to go too much into details, but highlight just two points that bring me to the conclusion to support this:  We are onboarding a really skilled team with a unique background - this is a great opportunity for us to evolve. It is not only about the skills they have but also about the nice side effect of unlocking the Project Sandbox (will link to the summary of @SES-Core-Unit  once it is live) Yes, there are uncertainties about the legal and regulatory implications - but again: we are not modifying the protocol here - we just onboard a great team that will take care of dealing with this as well. This is a unique opportunity - you might think of a high-risk high-reward situation - and we should not miss it.  ",

But like the D3M, this is not about revenue, this is about making a strong message to the userbase. A GUSD-PSM will support this.  Add WBTC-C as a new Vault Type (thread) voted Yes ETH-C has been a nice addition to our portfolio, I expect the same to happen with WBTC-C as well. I believe the trade-off of having fewer income by a lower Stability Fee is getting to get offset by having a lower risk on our side in case of a large market downturn and we are potentially also attracting different and more users to this product.  Increase the Aave D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling (thread) voted Yes I would like to see the D3M in a position to enforce a maximum variable borrow rate as soon as possible. For that, we will need a lot higher DC than suggested with this poll. However I am fully trusting @Derek and his team to go with the appropriate speed.  Increase the System Surplus Buffer  (thread) voted  Option 3: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week. Option 4: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week. Option 1: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week. Option 2: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week.  My primary goal here is to get the SB increased as quick as possible. Going with the 1 MM/week option leaves more than 60% of the profit for MKR burning. Having a higher SB will not only protect us better in case of a crash, but will also allow us to do more experiments (e.g. with RWAs and higher DCs on them). You may find it strange that I favour the 90 MM option over the 130 MM options - I simply think that we will need to revisit our strategy around increasing the Surplus Buffer short term anyway, so i would rather make a commitment on a shorter timespan. There were some concerns about the flap-Keeper ecosystem not being in a good shape, but haven\u2019t seen a single auction since we restarted burning that was not running good. It does not take much to keep it alive, we can be safer by just continously burning a bit - but even some months of not burning has not hurt the ecosystem much.  Ending 2021-11-28T23:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - SB-frOGI (SolidBlock Red Frog Digital Coin) (thread) voted Abstain I honestly have no opinion here, and I am looking forward to have a better greenlight procedure for RWA in the future as outlined in here.  Community Greenlight Poll - MONETALIS (Monetalis Wholesale SME Green Growth Lending) (thread) voted Yes Looks like a nice opportunity to get more DAI from RWA and also fits nicely to the Green Money idea.

I am really sad we need to make these adjustments, but they are necessary given the current gas-prices. We need to be prepared for liquidating vaults, it is just not avoidable to make these changes. I hope we can be more open once we allow minting on L2s.  Use the MakerDAO Treasury to Fund MKR Expenses (thread) voted Yes As long as we have MKR in our treasury it just does not make sense to mint some for MKR vesting. Even if we cannot agree on burning some of it or putting it to work, we have this option to use it.  Add GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A as a new Vault Type (thread) voted Yes The proposed stability fees are unlikely going to attract users of this vault-type, but we can adjust them later. The first version of integrating the GUNI-product into our stack was already a huge success though not in terms of revenue. I hope we can tweak the parameters, as this is a nice way helping to keep the peg.

Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee (thead) voted Yes The proposed changes by MOMC are reasonable - both in terms of balancing growth and profit, but also in terms of trying to break even vault-types with their oracle costs. I would like to see a lower bar and higher debt-ceiling for D3M mid-term so we can grow the footprint of DAI in DeFi and also making some profit out of it.  Add CurveLP-stETH-ETH as a new Vault Type (thread) voted Yes I am really happy to see another staked ETH product appear in our portfolio. Let\u2019s hope it gets enough traction for covering the oracle costs, but you have to spend money to make money. ",

Thanks a lot!  If all new vault-types would work this way we wouldn\u2019t need to talk about offboarding that often  I have been supporting the last increase and of course also support this increase of the Debt Ceiling.  Adjust MATIC-A System Parameters (thread) voted Yes Really happy to see that MATIC-A finally gets some traction. I guess we will no longer need to talk about offboarding this vault-types if the proposed line will be utilized. Thanks @Risk-Core-Unit for taking the initiative. Lowering the gap also fits to the proposal by MOMC  (ratified onchain here).  Ending 2021-12-19T23:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - G-UNIv3-DAIUSDP (Gelato UniswapV3 DAI-USDP LP Token) (thread) voted Yes This is a similar application to GUNIV3DAIUSDC1 but based on USDP (PAX). The situation is almost the same - we also have a PSM for it which is already heavily used. I have some doubts that this will really get used as both 0.01% and 0.05% have insignificant volume right now - but in the end this is just a green light poll and the smart people from our Core Units will have some deeper look at it before this eventually goes into the protocol. If this gets a positive attestation by our Core Units I think it does make sense to have it as it is a valuable addition the PSM diversifying our risk. My main concern right now is about oracle costs and projected utilization. ",

With a bar of 3.75% we are most probably not coming anywhere near the DC-target. Nevertheless, I want us to be prepared for sudden spikes in DAI borrowing at Aave so we can provide help on stable variable borrowing rates. That\u2019s why I prefer the highest option on the DC-target.  Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier (thread) votes Yes Unlike the previous polls related to delegate compensation I do not Abstain but instead support this. The current implementation is a bit too harsh on the cut-off, which led to undesirable effects for @MakerMan in the last months. This is a step in the right direction.  Ending 2021-12-19T23:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - aUST (Anchor TerraUSD) (thread) voted No @flipflopflapdelegate did some research on this token, and also @monet-supply from the Risk team made a comment on it. I am agreeing to both assessments and therefor do not support moving forward with this application. ",

Extending this tool to Compound is a logical next step.  Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold (thread) voted Yes Most of the MKR is not locked in our voting contract and the current ESM Threshold is just barely above the liquidity in Aave, Sushi, UniV2 combined. It should be a lot more difficult for a bad actor to shut down the protocol. Raising the threshold to 100k is a step in the right direction.  Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance (thread) voted Yes Depending on further investigations and details provided by @Growth-Core-Unit and @Real-World-Finance this could evolve in a great way of providing DAI to the markets. Note we are not voting here on any parameters yet, this is just to test the water if the community is supporting this initiative.  Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults (thread) voted Yes Increasing the dust is always a sad move at it excludes even more users from the protocol. But given the current gas-prices, it is also not economically sound for participants to join the game without being able to provide the necessary amount of collateral anyway. Still hoping for L2   Proposal - Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow  (thread) voted Abstain I don\u2019t like us to perform a special treatment just because the victim is well connected and the amount of DAI is especially huge. We need to set up a process for those cases, also taking the costs for recovery into account. This should really not be handled on individual cases. Some kind of seed-funding of a MIP taking care of those situations would be a nice compensation in this case. On the other hand: it would not be reasonable to ask the victim to wait some months until a MIP is done and ratified, and this is about 10 MM DAI not usable on Optimism. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - OUSD (Origin Dollar) (thread) voted No Being tied to USDT is a big red flag for me. But even ignoring this, I don\u2019t think onboarding this asset will bring enough benefit to justify the risk.

Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings) (thread) voted Abstain I have doubts this collateral will make sense for us, but after all this is a greenlight poll just to put a priority to it.  Community Greenlight Poll - TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD)  (thread) voted No We still have a good amount of TUSD sitting in the TUSD-A and a PSM would be a nice thing to offload the remains so it would be easily accessible for people who want to swap their DAI to TUSD - but not the other way round. The Debt Ceiling for TUSD-A has been set to 0 more than a year ago (reasons: here, here) and setting up a PSM with a Debt Ceiling > 0 is not something appropriate in the current situation.  Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) (MIP40c3-SP45) (thread) voted Yes While I agree with some of the comments that this proposal should be split in two seperate ones I don\u2019t think it will change a lot - MakerDAO will cover both parts and it is correct to do so. There is bigger fish to fry on the oracles side. It was clear that with the carve out of the oracles team the operational gas-costs would still be covered by the foundation and that this will transition later - now it is happening.  Ratification Poll for Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) (thread) voted Yes This is a well established team with a track record transitioning over to the DAO.

Ratification Poll for Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62)  (thread) voted Yes Great to see we are finally formalizing this procedure, thanks a lot @PaperImperium for driving this initiative.  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47)  (thread) voted Yes The Starknet Engineering CU has delivered from the start and I am happy to support the next steps. L2 support for Maker is desperately needed.  Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64)  (thread) voted Yes Nice to see the newly founded Immunefi CU is starting to get some traction. Let\u2019s hope we will not see the 10 MM reward anytime soon   Ratification Poll for Maker Keeper Network (MIP63)  (thread) voted Yes This is a step into the right direction.

Ratification Poll for Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) (thread) voted No I do agree that there are issues w.r.t. cost VS output and the lack of transparency and OKRs - but the latter is not something unique to this Coreunit.

Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) (thread) voted Yes I am hoping the RWF-turmoil is now finally settled, best wished for @williamr taking over and a big Thank you to @SebVentures - really happy you found a next place within the DAO to keep contributing!

                    "content": "Thanks so much for the feedback! I\u2019m Scarlet Chen, CEO of Robinland. As you mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of the community greenlight poll about our MIP6 proposal here. We saw that you have some questions/concerns so would like to reach out proactively to see if there\u2019s anything we might be able to answer. Robinland channels liquidity from Defi lenders like Maker to fund real estate development projects for a better physical world. Our team consists of real estate industry veteran, crypto native coder, and lawyer familiar with the legal process underneath a security token offering (STO, only process the SEC approves of to issue on-chain crypto tokens that represents real world asset). We tokenize real estate debt projects via security token issuance, and pledge the tokens with Maker to access financing. The projects are all first lien projects w/ full recourse rights, from developers w/ A ratings in NYC. Compared to other proposals (some already approved) on the forum, our advantage is: (1) there is no retail investor involved in any stage, which mitigates compliance risk for Maker (2) there is no utility token or NFT involved in our process, only security tokens, which ensures 100% compliance w/ current SEC rules about securitization (3) we have in-house lawyers familiar w/ the STO process, and our COO has structured Reg D and Reg A fund in her previous career, which are the same underlying process of how we onboard a debt project at Robinland. As for track record: (1) our COO has been in the real estate industry for 7 years and (2) our lawyer has been in practice for 10 years on the same legal process (3) our real estate projects are supplied by Crowdfunz, a real estate PE w/ 5 years track record, 0 default rate, and 10-20 projects financed every year. This is all reflected in the proposal we put together - We talked to one of the senior members of the governance community, and he said \u2018this is far more superior than anything I\u2019ve seen on the forum; lots of concerns have been addressed ex ante, like providing Maker w/ a put option\u2019. We\u2019ve spent a long time & lots of thoughts putting together the proposal, read most of the proposals on our forum of similar nature, talked to 5+ lawyers about our structure, and also one of the major members of the Maker governance to get feedback. We truly believe that we\u2019re bringing a better alternative to both parties (supply of projects and supply of liquidity) in this ecosystem! We noticed that a large fraction of the community has voted \u2018abstain\u2019, and one delegate voted \u2018no\u2019, which is why we\u2019re proactively reaching out. We\u2019re happy to respond to any feedback/criticism the community and/or you might have, as we believe we have the capacity to change our proposal in a way that accommodates Maker\u2019s needs. My apologies for the intrusion if any! And we\u2019re here to answer any question you might have. Many thanks for your time and we really appreciate it! ",

Especially lowering ETH-A WSTETH-A Stability Fees and increasing our share on AAVE-DAI through the D3M is something I support. There has been some discussion on the high Debt Ceiling for GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A (data can be found here, discussion on the chat), but I don\u2019t think we should have an artificially low Debt Ceiling on those GUNI-based-vaults. The market will find an equilibrium on its own.  Decrease the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio (thread) voted Yes This brings GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A to the same level as GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A - cannot see a reason why we shouldn\u2019t do this.  Ending 2022-01-23T23:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - RBLD (Robinland Holdings) (thread) changed vote to Yes (Greenlight) After a call with @Scarlet_Chen and reading the post of @LongForWisdom about the intention of MIP6-Greenlight-Polls I changed my vote to support this application. I think this asset is totally worth exploring and there is no reason to stop it right here. ",

After waiting one year for this thing to work out we need to realize it is not going to happen (almost all vaults are undercollateralized) and we should do something about it. Even if we start again with TUSD as collateral in the future, it is best if we get this cleared. I believe the best way to achieve this is to just activate Liquidations and let keepers do it for us. Adding a dedicated PSM is just adding more work on @Protocol-Engineering - and they have bigger fish to fry.  Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper (thread) voted Yes We have been stopping the MKR burn as a urgency exec and this has created a vivid discussion about the pros and cons of keeping the partial burning VS not doing so. I have to admit I am not super convinced that the partial burning we had before this event was the right thing to do - but we should not use an urgency situation as an excuse to stop burning entirely. The Rate Limiter is a reasonable investment even if we decide to move ahead with a different Flap-strategy midterm - but it is mandatory if we want to keep the strategy we had before the urgency exec. In my discussions with @Derek I got the impression it is a reasonable investment from the engineering-capacity perspective as well.  Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial (thread) voted Abstain Needed to think about this a bit, but returning to the same state as before: this needs to pass without me supporting it. MIP61 is in discussion for some months now - I don\u2019t think it is a big issue it hasn\u2019t been submitted so far. But of course it would bring some more certainty - but this is a 1st world problem I guess  ",

After the experience we made with the offboarding of Content Production CU I think we should try to make sure we reduce the risk of \u201cexperimenting failing\u201d as much as possible. Offboarding is going to be hurting no matter how professional we are going to be on that. we haven\u00b4t  done enough yet to minimize the risk: This Coreunit is not set up for success, For this team to be successfull, they need to have buyin and endorsement from their customers - the existing Coreunits and their facilitators. I have strong evidence this buyin and endorsement is not there. technically, the experiment is already running for some time - at least some of the time in incubation within @SES-Core-Unit an be counted that way.   Ratification Poll for Intangible Asset Assignment (MIP60)  (thread) voted Yes This is long overdue (though just a bureaucratic procedure) and will help the DAO to manage things like Twitter-accounts. For those who haven\u2019t noticed yet: https://twitter.com/MakerDAO is a thing again   Ending 2022-03-06T23:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - PUNK (NTFX CryptoPunk) (thread) voted Yes Really not convinced we are going into a territory a dedicated ilk will make sense - but I support the idea to generally investigate on using NFT as collateral. Probably a better candidate for the idea stolen by @juan in this post. Note this is just a Greenlight Poll and by no means a guarantee this will get onboarded. ",

Adding Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions (thread) voted Yes Supporting this proposal by @Primoz even if I think we should go a lot lower for the lid. Imho we should set it as low as possible so any burning is stretched over as much time as possible. However, I failed to raise my concerns earlier so for the sake of making progress, we should start with something. I will trigger a discussion with a Signal Request to set the lid lower next week after I am back from skiing. ",

I just don\u2019t want to create precedence of Signal Requests asking for funding. Regardless of the topic. In this specific case: we decided to offboard a CU and we have to deal with the collateral effects. Our existing processes for doing those things might not be perfect, but there are certainly ways that can be taken. I\u2019d rather see this thing working as part of an existing Core Unit (e.g. if this is about translating gov-material, can this be embedded into @gov-comms-core-unit ?) or as part of an @SES-Core-Unit Incubation - which will certainly also help to create a proper reporting and accounting structure around it. Some CUs have been running grants-programs successfully (latest example: adopting @makerburn into Risk), might be another option.  Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount (MIP4c3-SP1) (thread) voted Yes Pretty straight forward, thanks @psychonaut for pushing on this. Repeating the reasoning from him here:    [Signal Request] Promote \"MIP4c3-SP1: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount\" to on-chain poll   Considerations (not really Pro or Con):  Increase the payout for Critical severity web bugs from the range 5k-50k to a single amount 50k. Reduce negotiation around the Critical severity bounty amount. Increase incentive for whitehat hackers to pursue potential Critical severity web bugs.    ",

Active Polls  Ending 2022-03-27T22:00:00Z   Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) (thread) voted Yes This has been quite a long time for consideration on my side and I have been opposing this huge increase on the expenses for a couple of days. But eventually, I decided to support this budget after a call I had with @williamr If we want to go into RWAs, we shouldn\u2019t do that half-hearted. Yes, it breaks my heart we need to put up that much money to onboard RWAs onto our stack - but the alternative is to stop our activities and let others do the job. We are still in an early stage here, and we need to spend money if we want to make money here. Yep, this is still a bet that onboarding RWAs helps scaling DAI - but eventually it is a bet I am willing to make - not only as a delegate but also as a MKR holder. This little thing needs to learn flying, but if we don\u2019t fund the wings we should better tear it down entirely. I am not ready for that yet.  Ratification Poll for Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) (thread) voted Abstain There is really nothing I can add to the reasoning of @MakerMan on his delegation-platform:    MakerMan delegate platform   To be clear I support MakerDAO delegate compensation even if I wasn\u2019t a delegate. I believe the work done by delegates is needed and in fact compensation is still too low for the work many delegates do. I would have switched from Abstain to Yes to pass this, BUT I believe when it comes to conflict of interest voting such as this proposal it is the IOU/MKR holders that need to vote and decide these polls NOT delegates. My intention is to abstain from these kinds of conflict of interest votes in the future because I believe delegates should not be put into conflict of interest positions. Point of note here I am still waiting for a polling mechanism to be created that uses some form of snapshot so we can determine if MKR voting is a cost issue or not. We could use this snapshot to poll MKR holders directly on conflict of interest issues for ALL delegate issues.   Truth is: there is not a lot of MKR in the voting contract that is not delegated to recognized delegates - so it will be hard in the future to get stuff like this done without recognized delegates supporting it. So: thanks a lot to @monet-supply @ACREinvest and @GFXlabs for taking one for the team  ",

We need more of that. We have been underestimating the importance of brand building and this event will help.  Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge (thread) votes Yes Excited to see we are making more steps forward into L2-territory. 5MM DC is a reasonable first setting.  Short Ratification Poll for MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) (thread) voted Yes As we have offboarded MKT-001 the Collateral Offboarding Process needs to be updated.  Investigate Implementation of a Notional Finance D3M (thread) voted No While this looks like a Declaration of Intent the poll explicitly asks \u201cwhether a Notional Finance D3M should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the Core Units and Domain Teams.\u201d There are two reasons I vote against:  I personally would not put any DAI into Notional Finance - so why would I force our CUs to make a plan doing that? this is clearly a step of micromanaging our CoreUnits. We should stop doing that.  If adding a D3M on Notional would make sense it would have been pretty easy to move ahead with this initiative by collaborating with the relevant CoreUnits on the idea and bringing up a joint proposal to the community asking if we want that or not. I am absolutely  not objecting on getting approval from the community on initiatives like this, but reading the comments on the thread clearly shows this is premature. Instead the procedure looks like we are trying to enforce a direction. I really don\u2019t like that, this is not the modus operandi I envision for us. We should avoid micromanaging on tasks and solutions and rather prioritize on objectives and goals. Oh and yes, having a rather inactive MKR holder suddenly showing up for the onchain poll is not giving me a better feeling about this topic.  Personal Note I and my youngest kid just got tested positive on covid - I guess this is going to affect my whole family over the next days. My availability might be affected.

I really enjoyed the procedure that happened before the spell hit the voting portal, huge shoutouts to @blimpa and @LongForWisdom for coordinating around it and the explaination given by @Kurt_Barry - up to the last minute I was not sure if this is a fire drill or a real thing. After being hampered by COVID in the last two weeks not being on full throttle on Maker-things, this was a nice opportunity to help securing the protocol.

I\u2019d like GovComms to increase their footprint within their current mandate. Mid-term, I really would like to have some tools that makes it easier for the community to compare budget-figures between the different CoreUnits. Maybe @strat-fin-core-unit has some ideas on harmonizing budgeting and accounting best-practices?   Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63)  (thread) voted No I don\u2019t think it is the right time to extend the GovComms team by a Public Relations Project Manager. It is not too much about the additional costs we need to cover, but more about the risk of having an unaligned branding strategy. I\u2019d rather have GovComms keeping their current scope and excel at it before going deeper.  Ratification Poll for Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh (MIP39c2-SP30) (thread) voted No Same as above: Cannot really support a mandate refresh if I am not supporting the necessary budget for it - right?  Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) (thread) voted Yes Basic housekeeping, shutting down the multisig of the former Content Production CoreUnit.  Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68)  (thread) voted Yes I am really happy about seeing the first steps of further increasing the bandwidth by adding more FTE into the core engine team. @Derek is doing a great job leading this CoreUnit and I am confident he will continue delivering with his crew.  Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) (thread) voted No I spend some time talking to @tadeo in Amsterdam last week, and I have to admit I am a bit puzzled how we got to this point. There was this comment by @tmierzwa which left me under the impression of this being a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d proposal, and then just a few hours ago another comment him stepping down to allow @tadeo taking over. I am by no means that much of a German to now allow a certain amount of chaos, but\u2026 Isn\u2019t this a great opportunity to restart this endeavor by building up the right setup so this CoreUnit is setup for success? Maybe not to the same extend as I already asked the Talent CoreUnit - but surely it makes sense to sit together with the customers of this coreunit (as this is a service-CoreUnit serving other CoreUnits) and agree on the interface and service this CoreUnit will offer in the future? Asking for a budget increase and MKR vesting in the current situation is not the right thing to do.  Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) (thread) voted No same tune as for the budget request: I\u2019d rather see this being built up together with the CoreUnits being served. I personally have doubts about the need for RWA dashboards and analytics - I can\u00b4t see how the engineering effort justifies the benefit. But I am for sure wrong, but I\u2019d like to hear that from the domain-owners (RWF in this case).  Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team (thread) voted Yes This onboards the whole Collateral Engineering Services Domain Team of CES as a MIP7-Domainteam. Not objecting to this.  Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2)  (thread) voted Yes Another step forward to improve the collateral onboarding process. Can\u2019t find anything bad about it.  Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)  (thread) voted Yes I did a short trip to EthAmsterdam last week to meet up with some Maker people and to see the second event built by this team. There are just three questions that need to get answered w.r.t. to this Core Unit proposal:  should we invest in Events? does it make sense to have a dedicated group on our payroll instead of just outsourcing this to some agency? is this Core Unit capable of providing this service to the DAO  I think all questions are to be answered with yes:  Conferences like EthDenver and EthAmsterdam are rare opportunities for builders to meet in real life - and for us a great opportunity to build our brand among those people. if you want a consistent event experience it is going to be really hard to find an external partner being able to do that. A MakerParty should have the same look&feel regardless where it is happening. the team around @PonJerry has created an even better atmosphere in Amsterdam - and I already enjoyed the event at Denver pretty much. One can clearly see this team is excited and committed on delivering high-quality events for the DAO.  I agree that we still lack on Brand Startegy (typo intended), but this domain can be clearly handled by this Core Unit. Lezgo!  Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) (thread) voted Yes This is clearly outside of my domain of expertise but it looks like this is an improvement. Also very much trusting the originators of this MIP to do the right things.  Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66)  (thread) voted No I am not too much in the mood for funding another fixed-rate implementation right now. Especially given the costs associated with this proposal.  Ending 2022-05-01T22:00:00Z   Community Greenlight Poll - sETH2 (Stakewise Staked ETH) (thread) voted Yes Like all Greenlight polls I am supporting this as I don\u2019t see any red flags right now. Hope we don\u2019t find any more along the way in the future - but as of now there is nothing wrong about it.  Community Greenlight Poll - HVBANK (Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Collateral) (thread) voted Yes Like all Greenlight polls I am supporting this as I don\u2019t see any red flags right now. Hope we don\u2019t find any more along the way in the future - but as of now there is nothing wrong about it. ",

However - the Budget Proposal is now pending for quite some time so I ask @aburban90 to get this finalized asap.

Even from FEI perspective it would be more efficient to just borrow against their ETH (ETH-C is running with 0.5%). On the long run, even an IV might be an option (assuming there would be enough DAI demand from it) Adding to what the other Tim said yesterday:    Feedblack Loops LLC Delegate Platform (FBL)   The first thing is: that once collateral gets greenlit, there is little chance to say no, other than one recommendation to keep the debt ceiling low. \u201cIt\u2019s only a green light\u201d is incomplete reasoning on my part. Once the foot is in, the pressure is on the CU\u2019s to make deals happen. Which we have to fix as a community. Teams need to be able to say no, both faster and sooner.   I am actually not sure if this is really the case - as I would assume a thorough investigation on the collateral application post-greenlight would have revealed some news that might influence the perspective. But I agree that we in general should be more cautious on what kind of collateral makes sense to be onboarded given the associated risk; where I have nothing but a gut feeling right now - but 2MM/y seems not like a proper tradeoff. I absolutely do not oppose to the idea to collaborate with other protocols - FEI included - but adding the competing stablecoin (which is off-peg a bit right now) as a collateral is not the first step.

The recent market downturn moved the MKR price into a range where I believe we are highly undervalued. I do not believe buying 3MM DAI worth of MKR tokens are going to make a real difference on the price short term, but I think it is useful to pile up more of that cheap MKR into the DAO hands for future use. Of course this is adding another topic into the queue of @Protocol-Engineering  and they already have plenty of high-priority topics on their TODO-list - but after talking to @Derek I am convinced this is a good investment of resources now. While this is just an experiment with 3MM (and remember: we made around 5MM DAI in the last days just out of liquidation penalties) - this lays the foundation of using this mechanism later on again.  Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT (thread) voted Yes MakerDAO will receive a Velodrom airdrop so we can incentivize pools on this Optimism based AMM. The proposal is about which pools we want to push (DAIOP + DAIUSDC) and what to do with the generated fees (direct them to a DAO owned wallet). There are no downsides on supporting this proposal, so no reason to object.  Add rETH as a new Vault Type (thread) voted Yes Although rETH currently has a market cap too low for us to be comfortable to generate >30MM DAI from it, I believe it is important to onboard this collateral for diversification of staked ETH. The proposal adds a line of 5 MM which is a reasonable first step to start this experiment. ",

Catching up will for sure take some time next week, but since I am already awake and my family is still sleeping - I decided to write down my current thoughts. Let\u2019s check if my opinions hold up against a better informed schuppi in a couple of days   The Decentralization - Dear Leader drama Tons of voices out there ragging about @rune threatening delegates he will undelegate if they don\u2019t commit to his plan. I don\u2019t get it - what do you all think this is? Some kind of hippie commune? He can do whatever he wants with his MKR - nobody has a special privilege to maintain their delegated MKR. I lost ~50% of the delegated MKR from him yesterday and seriously - I am not having any kind of hard feelings about that. This is the risk you take as a delegate if you don\u2019t diversify. (but for sure I am super relieved I never seriously considered quitting my offchain job and go all-in on Maker) I think it is totally fine and reasonable to delegate to those who support your agenda and undelegate from those who don\u2019t. The only flaw we are seeing here is not about Rune, it is about - aside from very view - other MKR holders not participating in governance - either directly or by delegation. This will not change until we deploy heavy governance-participation incentives (and by that punishing those who don\u2019t). But for now it seems that the vast majority of MKR holders simply do not care. Back in the Autonmous MakerDAO Working Group I brought up that even in a fully decentralized organization it would be highly beneficial to have a CEO on top providing a vision, fostering a plan and having the ability to execute with their workforce. We lack that, and no - I don\u2019t think the current setup of MakerDAO can compensate this. So I am actually happy that Rune stepped up pushing his plan. Everybody is welcome to come up with a different one. There is tons of unused MKR out there that can be used to rally for it. My take on the inactivity is: those MKR holders don\u2019t care and by that are fine with moving ahead with this plan. If you don\u2019t use your voting power, you also lose your right to complain.  A plan! So finally we have it! Someone who is heavily advocating for a long term plan, facilitating discussions and by that generating buyin, and having the power to execute (by having the vast majority of MKR used in governance). That\u2019s great! Lezgo!  \u2026but is this everything? No. There is tons of stuff that needs to be decided and checked on even if we totally focus on the Endgame. We have a running business and my involvement as a delegate is not going to change that much just because we have the Endgame Plan and execute on it. My current view on the Engame Party - for sure I am going to party as soon as we really start making moves into this direction, but I don\u2019t see a reason to join a party - though I am probably more dovish than hawkish. Do I want to help? For sure! MKR holders will decide if my help justifies any delegation or not. ",

Poll Update  Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) (thread) voted No (replacing previous Abstain vote) Before going into the reasons why I switched: I still think we need to do something about DAI liquidity. this SPF would have helped. Does not feel too good of being an early supporter of this proposal to now voting against it.  we see a lot of new voters coming in - but quite obviously not because Maker is attractive again, but because rallying VCs seems to be a new thing. Cannot really say a lot against it, code is law and yadayada - but given the proposal faces a lot of concerns from the community I don\u2019t think a 50% majority is sufficient. As this is the current modus operandi, I do my part of enforcing this a bit by voting against it a 5/7 multisig is likely not good enough given we want this SPF manage 10MM DAI. I don\u2019t think we can avoid the multisig-problem as a whole, but we could have a lot more and diverse set of comptrollers checking on it yield farming. I don\u2019t think it is worth the effort. If we can purely concentrate on the liquiditiy-topic, that would probably reduce the existing pushback   Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) (thread) voted No Same reason about VC-rallying as in the Makershire proposal, but this is a different level. This is not how you win the hearts of the community. ",

Select a Target Level of rNPI Profitability to Guide Budget Cuts (thread) voted  1st choice: Negative (Minimum 3 years runway at any time) 2nd choice: Break-even (Plus-minus 5%)  While I think a healthy discussions on expenses has started, I think we should not overshoot here. In the current market condition it is better to run net-negative than to cripple our workforce. Thanks @strat-fin-core-unit for facilitating.  Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment (thread) voted  1st choice: Maker Teleport 2nd choice: Compound D3M 3rd choice: DssGate 4th choice: Collateral Onboarding  Initially thought those options do make sense, I don\u2019t do anymore. I guess it would be a lot better to vote on goals instead of micromanaging\u2026 Not sure this is helpful for anyone, but anyway: I still hope native L2-DAI-supply will be a game changer, hence Teleport on top spot. Compound D3M was initially ranked at place 1, but since there is not a lot room for utilization in the current market - not so urgent anymore. But it probably does not make a lot of sense to stop this initiative (D3M time will come again), so probably also not good to let anyone downvote it now ;-p Included in the Compound D3M is a more generalistic approach - the initial Aave D3M implementation was tailored for Aave. Another good reason to keep going. DssGate: Important to get this done, as it is a prerequisite for the DECO-integration. Collateral Onboarding: put to the last spot because there is not a lot to onboard. Still want to mention it, because i\u2019d like to see a Maker future where vaults provide the majority of DAI and not PSMs.  Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class (thread) voted  1st choice: Core Crypto Collateral 2nd choice: Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral 3rd choice: Broader Market Demand-Based Solutions 4th choice: Crypto Collateral from Other Chains  This prioritization sentiment poll is even more extreme to the point of micro-decision-making as the other one. My goal would be to satisfy as much of the DAI-demand without using PSMs. Does not really matter which one (of course risk/reward plays a role - which is part of any collateral onboarding process). We have smart people on the payroll that are encouraged to come up with smart initiatives, partnerships. ",

I had the great pleasure and honour to play guinea pig for the @dux-core-unit to be the first delegate testing the migration flow on production - worked like a charm! I updated the platform statement already (changelog)  pointing to the new contract removing the 2nd executive-only contract as nobody was using it  I will continue using both contracts (old one, new one) as long as the old contract is not expired. The new contract is currently listed as a shadow delegate contract, which will change as soon as the new release is on production. Technically it is already possible to move over by  undelegating from the old delegate contract  delegating to the new delegate contract - or delegate to someone else - good opportunity if you realize I am not good enough for your precious MKR ;-p  but you can also just wait until the new release is out of the door and experience the smooth UX the DUX-team has built! I was already a bit nervous and impatient, because I initially wanted at least 4 weeks for the delegators to migrate - but looking back I think the additional waiting time was worth it since the UX is really nice!

As I mentioned in the announcement post published earlier the notion of \u2018expiry\u2019 is there for a reason, but could have been solved more elegantly. The involved members from the PE team agreed that there are some ways to improve the UX through better delegate contract design, but this was too late for the currently deployed contracts\u2026 We made the decision to focus on the UX in the Voting Portal for now (as a means to minimize the risk of missing the deadline [ie. the first expiring contracts] and minimising dependencies on PE), but later this year we\u2019ll collaborate between PE, DUX and GovAlpha on an improved design for delegate contracts. In short; the need for migration sucks and the associated friction and gas costs even more so. The Voting Portal makes sure that delegators are warned in case they need to migrate\u2014no need for manually keeping track of things. And lastly; this will be all be mitigated through a better delegate contract design (release timeline n/a yet) @ultraschuppi Hope you don\u2019t mind me chiming in here  ",

This SR doesn\u2019t give any power to SF, it simply formalizes how the DAO will proceed with budget adjustments pursuant to the on-chain poll that stated the DAO\u2019s goal should be to move to cash flow breakeven.

Rune has mentioned his desire to have a variety of DVCs, each with distinct domains. To oversimplify regarding this proposal, delegates could specialize in technical, operations, or product for example and give feedback to Core Units within the specialized domain. ",

Further crippling the DAI foundation as outlined in the Super Bear option should not happen, hence I put the Base option as the 2nd option. replaced here  Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) (thread) voted Yes A clear improvement to the offboarding procedure - special thanks to @GFXlabs @twblack88 and @psychonaut on moving this forward. I am a bit sad this commit hasn\u2019t made it to the final state ;-p  Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) (thread) voted  1st choice: Approve proposed budget (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months) 2nd choice: Approve existing budget (Business as usual)  While it remains unclear for me how an exempt from a future budget cut will be enforced - but I guess this is not about code is law  I like to see proactive budget cuts from CoreUnits, so thumbs up to this proposal.  Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) (thread) voted Yes This amendment generalized MIP50 that was created for the AAVE-D3M for future usecases. Nothing controversial about it.  Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) (thread) voted Yes The two most controversial points (relying on a CoreUnit to manage it, providing liquidity to non-stable pairs) have been removed. It is a good first step for providing DAI liquidity - especially on L2s - so there is really nothing left to vote against it.  Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) (thread) voted No We just recently onboarded the Events Core Unit, so one might find it a bit weird about talking about offboarding again so soon. I don\u2019t think so - if a Core Unit is not meeting the expectations, we should be totally able to offboard them. But the Events Core Unit is delivering. I saw their work at the pilot event in Denver and also later in Amsterdam and Paris. Creating a unique Brand Experience at those events is an important tool for Maker to raise awareness. We don\u2019t have a dedicated Marketing team right now (which would be a lot more expensive to the protocol!), and if we would have, we wouldn\u2019t offboard this team as well. So thanks to @PonJerry and @Leggevents - please keep up the good work! ",

Given the lack of clear KPIs, objectives, comparability and what not (management tools) the only way to find out if we have enough bang for the buck is by  looking at the output/outcomes (agreed: pretty subjective) how much budget gets burned anecdotal situations like  bad: MKR-vesting repricing requests good: proactive ideas on how to reduce their burn    which either helps them staying afloat, under the radar, increasing their credibility or destroying it.

It\u2019s confusing because it\u2019s all chaotic but we are figuring it out slowly. This will all come in a budget-neutral way to the DAO as funds spent through the SPF will not be spent in RWF nor in CES. For that matter, if for whatever reason either of the SPFs fail, we will request the funding from CES. As a stopgap measure, CES funding RWA domain work is a good solution that can help clear a large backlog of RWA collateral, including a NS DC increase that @Khan pointed out and believe CES will look into.     ultraschuppi:  Thanks @christiancdpetersen for ignoring all of that and just continuing to work on that stuff, even if just recently getting fired.

Not enough on the uncertainty side to block it, but also not enough gut-feeling to support it.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal (thread) voted  1st choice: Option 2 2nd choice: Option 1  decreasing SFs on the flagship ilks is the right thing to do - with the upcoming merge we should make sure the buzz created around it can be directed into a higher utilization of our crypto-vaults. Even if the additional utilization might not offset the revenue-cuts we are creating by lowering the fees, it is a major step towards a lower DAI-from-Stablecoin ratio. WST-ETHB working pretty well, allowing more headroom there is reasonable, also the decreased SF on MANA-A as it has been fully utilized for some months now. Promoting the underutilized Curve stEth/Eth pool is a cheap way to attract more usage too.  Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) (thread) voted Yes thanks @christiancdpetersen to keep working on this issue and @strat-fin-core-unit for keep it rolling.  Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) (thread) voted Yes putting @christiancdpetersen on the spot again (quick reminder: he is among those that got removed from the now stale RWF-001\u2026) to allow the DAO to make progress on MIP65.  MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members (thread) voted No I totally get this is a weird situation getting fired just before the cliff - but I am not feeling good doing a one-off decision while in the middle of the whole turmoil. This sets just bad precedence and will just create more friction. The DAO already paid out MKR for long term contributors for their contributions as a retroactive bonus - which is a much better way of handling this once the dust has settled.  Updating HVBank (RWA-009) Legal Agreements (thread) voted Yes following the suggestion by @monkey.irish and the procedural explanations by @prose11 - this makes sense to me ",

Edit: Change my vote from No to Yes after the comment of the well respected @rema from the Risk-CU. In the end, this is a greenlight and simply put an indication for \u201cdoes it make sense to further investigate\u201d. Thanks for standing up and advocating here!  Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) (thread) voted No Neither TVL nor trading volume of the underlying pool look promising enough to offset opportunity and oracle costs. I am in general not too optimistic on the future of *BTC, so I don\u2019t think we should invest energy here  Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) (thread) voted Yes Gnosis is solid and is actively seeking a partnership with us. Promising a mint of 30 MM  DAI is also significant, especially if we compare this with MANA and MATIC. We should give this is a shot.  Ratification Poll for Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP24) (thread) voted Yes A lean fix for the problem stated here.  If the new Delegation MIP Set does not get proper support,  this will certainly help. Thanks @PaperImperium for this improvement!  Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set (thread) voted Yes Yes, it feels weird doing anything else than abstaining on this poll. But I think this is great step forward. To highlight some points:  the participation metrics are tightened - though I have to admit I think 72h reaction time on executives is still too long. Having them valued x5 against polls is also important - we should be able to quickly pass executives. Not because it is important all the time, but it will be important for urgency executives at some point (we already had that) opening up the delegation ceiling up to 30k MKR is a great way to attract power-delegates (I won\u2019t be one of them, don\u2019t worry). The corresponding compensation allows for teams instead of individuals to do the job - this will bring a whole different quality. MKR vesting - it is pretty obvious that delegates should have long term incentives for the protocol to stay healthy and grow. I especially like the long(er) lockup times; something I would like to see also other contributor compensation models. Imho it could be a lot longer (up to a couple of years).  thanks @Patrick_J for driving this! ",

This partnership is far superior over the Coinbase Instititutional Rewards  (which is up for vote right now as well).  End DAI Funding For Sourcecred (thread) voted Yes Sad to stop this system, but let\u2019s be honest: the amounf of low effort posts has increased a lot if we compare with 1-2 years ago. GovAlpha has already started other ways of compensating community efforts, and I would love to see more of that. Sourcecred is just not cutting it anymore\u2026  MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations and MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee (thread) voted   Yes on removing the yield and other incentives from the  bar calculation and  0.5% on the spread  Comparing  Aave and Maker cannot just be done by looking at the yield that users get at Aave when supplying collateral for borrowing. If we would keep the current formula, we will not see any D3M supply anytime soon. However, I don\u2019t think going down to 0 spread is not the right approach right now. It will cannibalize our core product and the additional revenue is also not that significant. Hence, I just voted for the .5% spread option - despite being excited to see Approval Voting in action   Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set (thread) voted Yes Feels like years of iterating on Clean Money / Sagittarius / End-game.

Transparency of activities and spending are lacking. But there are few individuals as married to the protocol and its community as he is. He is Maker every minute of his day. The quality of his swag is unmet. Especially in times of depression, bringing some strategic happiness is not a nice-to-have. I know my position on this poll will not change anything on his offboarding - and I already fear what is ahead of us. The day Andrew leaving the community will be a sad day for us, I hope you find another place here @aburban90  Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) (thread) voted No Just a bit more than a year ago, we were arguing about a moonshot fund of 5MM DAI  and now we are about to kick out a team that \"made Maker cool again\"\u2122 at various crypto-conferences. A bit similar to SHCU, spending some money on good vibes at bear\u2019o\u2019clock seems to be an easy spot for layoffs. I\u2019d rather cut down incubation expenses, as this CoreUnit has some tangible results. I know the team is already moving, and the poll is not going to be flipped. So: thanks @PonJerry @Leggevents for your contributions, I really enjoyed the parties you did and to see all these happy faces of your attendees - I hope our paths cross some days again.  Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) (thread) voted No I find the parachute to be excessive and it smells like a \u201cshut up, take the money and go\u201d. More like a diamond parachute, eh  Not gonna lie, I am happy when we can close this chapter. But it feels wrong throwing out this money.  Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) (thread) voted No I know it feels tempting with all this precious yield. But imvho having billions in the PSM is weird in the first place and we should rather try to not rely on USDC too much. Getting yield out of it will not increase our motivation to do so. As we need to move ahead with PSMified collateral, something like the Gemini Proposal feels a lot better to me.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) (thread) voted No A bit tired on all of these new MIPs. I miss the old days when people just locked in collateral to leverage. The notion of us investing in something is not why I came here.  Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) (thread) voted Yes I abstained on the original greenlight poll, but since it passed and we need to do something it is just right that SFCU is picking this up. Cannot wait for the mandates   Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) (thread) voted Yes This reduces the days-in-limbo and also days-in-uncertainty for a questionable coreunit facilitator. Clearly an improvement. Thanks @CodeKnight for improving our bureaucracy  Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) (thread) voted Yes If this would have been published one week earlier\u2026 My bad  This was set up to provide a low-footprint way to remove the facilitator and is superseeded by the CoreUnit-offboarding that is up for vote.

Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A (thread) voted Yes Ren is going to sunset the current deployment and as we already have the Debt Ceiling set to 0 for two weeks, we are able to move fast on offboarding. The proposed liquidation parameters should allow its processing without any further delays.  Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) (thread) voted Yes Joshua is already acting without the title as the de-facto facilitator for the CoreUnit. This poll is just about adjusting the de-jure state according to the de-facto state.  Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) (thread) voted Yes The Mandate Refresh makes sense, no reason to object to it.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) (thread) voted  1st choice: Reject budget  2nd choice: Approve reduced budget - BearMarket   It is pretty clear that this CoreUnit will not be part of the MakerCore in the Endgame state. I therefor would like to see the activities run in this CoreUnit to be moved over to e.g. an Ecosystem Actor.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) (thread) voted  1st choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBase  2nd choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBear   @0xdeniz is successfully guiding his CoreUnit into the Endgame state and it is already clear that there will be tons of work to do for his team to support the new features that need to get built. Given that, supporting the CoreUnit with funding is crucial to move on.  Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) (thread) voted Reject Budget Similar to the Immunefi-situation: GovComs will not be part of MakerCore so its activities should transition into an Ecosystem Actor.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) (thread) voted  1st choice: Reject budget  2nd choice: Approve new bear budget   If the solutions provided by SAS should be kept, it should be served from an Ecosystem Actor. I have to admit I am no longer convinced that we need frontends for liquidations in the first place; I have never won a liquidation-auction since BT - always outrun by the bots. In any case - continuing the effort as a CoreUnit does not make a lot of sense given that the Endgame is now locked in.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) (thread) voted Reject Budget I don\u2019t think hiring more people makes sense right now, the expenses for operations are already quite high. Imvho most of the functions currently served from this CoreUnit should transition over into Ecosystem Actor-like structs - and since TechOps is already partly operating like a Ecosystem Actor by charging CoreUnits for their service, I think it would be a lot better to come up with a budget proposal already taking those transitioning initiatives into account - or just fully convert to an Ecosystem Actor directly.  Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) (thread) voted No I think it is premature to think about restricting POVE right now - I agree that there are still things that need to get sorted out, but the whole thing isn\u2019t built yet anyway. So no need to rush.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) (thread) voted Abstain in line with my general policy on RWA-polls  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) (thread) voted  1st choice: Approve standard option budget  2nd choice: Approve speedy operations platform option budget   SES is spearheading the Endgame transition - I learned a lot about that during talks with @Retro and @juan at ethgathering.com - and we should equip this team with the necessary budget to move. I don\u2019t think the \u201cspeedy operation\u201d is crucial, which is why I put it to 2nd option. ",

Of course we would need to adjust Stability Fees if this works out, but I am willing to go this path. I hope that 1% is already making a difference (despite comparable real world rates are even higher), which is why I put that to the highest position.  PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal (thread) voted Yes While most of the proposed changes look more like housekeeping changes to adjust to the current utilization of the ilks, some changes are pretty noteworthy:   WSTETH-A is getting a lot of traction, doubling the line while at the same time lowering the gap  offers both more utilization while reducing tail risk - those changes will also apply to the lower-risk-sibling WSTETH-B   WBTC-A, WBTC-B and WBTC-C are getting their line reduced by a lot - but even more important: proposed changes to gap and ttl will reduce tail-risks by 90%  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A will get their line reduced below their current utilization. PSMs   USDP: as there is really nothing we can do with it, it makes sense to increase the tin to encourage utilization in more valueable positions for the protocol  GUSD: it just took a month to suck up almost 0.5B GUSD into the PSM, which allows us apply a small tin and also reduce the tout a bit     Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI (thread, original request) voted Yes Despite my usual abstaining on RWA-related topics, I have to admit I am really happy that our engagement with New Silver has been so successful that even the originator @prankstr25 has not only asked to increase the Debt Ceiling, but also proposed an increase on the Stability Fee!

Also subsidizing WSTETH-B has not worked as expected; it is time to move forward here. Re-activating the D3M for Aave is at the right time. I hope we can get back to the same levels we already had. As we have started successfully monetizing our PSMs, we should make sure to get off those assets that are not providing any revenue for us. Increasing the tin to 0.2% for PSM-USDP-A is a good first step to send this message. ",

As the delegate contract is already controlled by a multisig, all that\u2019s needed to effect the changes is to add EOAs of that group onto it - i will still be a signer but not having blocking minority. After adding their EOAs all onchain interactions can be done by them. This group is called coldiron.eth and is not interested in direct participation in the DAO. Instead I will remain active as their advisor, but no longer making the decisions. This change will be made until the end of this month. As soon as the change is done, all further actions and communications will no longer be done by @ultraschuppi, but by a new forum account: @coldiron.eth. ",

                    "content": " Poll Updates  Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) (thread) voted Yes As long as we stick to the hard peg story, redeeming DAI for GUSD should be free. For me this is not much about the turmoil that is currently around GUSD, but of course this helps with the decision as well. I do not expect a lot of outflow of the GUSD-PSM just because we change this (happy to be wrong though) - but if y\u2019all feel that we took to much exposure, it is a good idea to reduce the barriers for GUSD flowing out of the PSM.  Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling (thread) voted   1st option: No change (500 million DAI).  2nd option: Decrease to 100 million DAI.  To be really clear about this: yes, I do feel uncomfortable about the GUSD exposure. But changing the line does not change anything - it is not reducing the amount of GUSD in the PSM. It is a rather symbolic step without having a real effect. If there would be a tangible plan how to really unwind and this would been up for voting, it would have been a different game. But what we see here is just sending a \u201cburn bridges, without having a plan to move forward\u201d. I would like to see \u201cless panic, more plan\u201d.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (thread) voted Yes I think I made my point here already. I find the \u201cbut muuh holidays\u201d reasons weird, because again: it is not about acting, it is about being able to act. We had no-exec-months before MIP51 got introduced already, I don\u2019t see a reason why this cannot be the default in the future even if the Calendar Exception is removed.  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) (thread) voted   1st option: Approve both  2nd option: Approve only the Higher Participation Requirements and Weighting for Executive Votes  3rd option: Approve only the Abstain Modifier  On the Abstain Modifier: I don\u2019t think that abstaining on every poll is a political message. It is just as lazy as not going to the polls at all. On the Higher Participation part: I liked the spirit that started with MIP77 and tried to carry a bit of that into this amendmend. I think it is a good first step to move forward to tighten up the formal requirements on onchain participation and its communication.  Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) (thread) voted No During the transition period we are in right now, MIP14 is probably going to be used a lot more. We might need it.  Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) (thread) voted Yes Same reasons as with the Repeal of the same underlying MIP: We will probably use this more often in the future, having more wiggle room will be handy.  Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) (thread) voted Yes long overdue housekeeping chore, thanks @blimpa for cleaning up a bit!  Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1)  voted Yes This is buying the TechOps CU a bit of time to bring their new budget proposal into the MIP cycle. /lgtm  Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (thread) voted Yes This will fund the transition period for ISCU to become a ecosystem actor until May 2023. /lgtm  Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) (thread)  voted Yes Another keeper to the network - welcome Chainlink Automation! Really cool to see more and more participants.  Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) (thread) voted Yes Pulling in external actors to help on RWA monitoring is a good idea. I really hope this attracts some parties applying for the initiative and by that creating a healthy competition.  Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) (thread) voted Yes Some small refinements to the Maker Keeper Network - thanks @hexonaut for driving this initiative.  Change of Delegate Platform The change announced here is about to move forward - the multisig changes are happening today. I will reach out to @GovAlpha-Core-Unit to coordinate on the platform update. All future communications in this platform are going to be made by @coldiron.eth I am looking forward for this new setup, and not at all being fearful or unhappy about it. My personal bonds with MakerDAO are not going to be affected at all - future is bright! <3 If anyone has doubts or does not like what is going on here - really happy to hear from you.

Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) (thread) voted No The future we see for the DAO is fully anon.

While the original MIP does not include \u201cfee sharing\u201d and not a lot of negotiations have been included before the freeze we feel it is pretty clear that Yearn is really interested in making steps forward on this collaboration.
