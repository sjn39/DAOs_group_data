                    "content": "Hello everyone! It\u2019s been a minute since I brought some (mostly) unfiltered musing to the forum, so I hope this reflection is welcomed and gets some discussion. Happy to take feedback on better ways to present these thoughts if you have them, just shoot me a DM. Maker the meme: a decentralized, central bank Whether you personally feel Maker should be inserting itself as a \u201cdecentralized, central bank,\u201d it\u2019s hard to argue that this perception isn\u2019t already saturated in the crypto space. People looking for a phrase to describe the protocol often lean on this description. Despite the linguistic oddity of being both decentralized and a \u201ccentral\u201d bank,  this description is at least partially accurate as an issuer of DAI. If you do not agree, I suggest checking out Seb\u2019s Crypto Banking 101 explanation as it makes a good case for how \u201cmoney layers\u201d function. So bearing in mind our perception (meme) as the (de)central bank, I began to wonder how me might be able to step into this role in the crypto space for more profits and notoriety. It\u2019s our brand so why not own it? DAOs helping DAOs Admittedly, my first thought re: Maker as a central bank was in connection to \u201cbailouts\u201d for lack of a better word. We already have experienced a positive situation where Yearn was able to borrow against their treasury token to make users whole after an exploit.   BitcoinExchangeGuide    Yearn Finance Uses Treasury to Mints 9.7M DAI to Repay yDAI Vault Hack Victims The Yearn Finance team has restored the yDAI vault and will repay users who lost over million in a hack earlier in the week. According to the official Twitter account, the team created a Maker vault and deposited over YFI tokens from its Treasury... Est. reading time: 1 minute       This event not only helped stabilize the greater DeFi ecosystem, but resulted in some positive press from Maker. However in this situation we were fortunate, YFI was already added as a collateral type and had plenty of available DC for the team to make users whole in a permissionless way. If that wasn\u2019t the case, would we have been able to raise the DC in time for Yearn to utilize our bank? Exploits will happen in crypto and more often than not, capital is needed if a project wishes to gain back the trust of their users. Is there a way to safely capitalize during a crisis and grow both Maker revenues and brand through partnering with other organizations? DAO to DAO is a pretty nice starting point in my mind and there is likely to be a bit more understanding about the speed of progress and the difficulty of making an agreement that has to be approved by token holders. A raising marketcap lifts all tokens\u2026 or something like that While other crypto projects necessarily represent competition for attention, capital, and often user solutions, we are not playing in a zero-sum game. Helping other organizations gives us the chance to increase DAI, SFs, and Maker awareness all across the crypto ecosystem. Huge thanks to @juan who put up with a far worse rant on this subject. Despite not liking the idea of bailouts (feel free to slam me if I\u2019m mischaracterizing  ) Juan made an excellent point that organizations could mint their token and borrow against it to fund growth, without dumping on the market. This would be a far safer scenario for Maker and wouldn\u2019t require urgent judgement calls on the solvency of other crypto projects. Yet how many DeFi protocols have tried to take advantage of this? One neat (and potentially uncorrelated) follow-up with Yearn is that they are now utilizing the YFI-A vault more healthily for YFI yield strategies. Could opening up our central-bankness lead to further integration and utilization? This growth case seems like a better deal for Maker as the positon would be opened during a far less volatile moment, but it too is just one example of how embracing our meme could lead to more DAI generation. Considerations and Next Steps Any push to take on more collateral is going to involve risk. New collaterals and tokens currently under attack ratchet up that risk pretty severely. Not to mention the amount of work (due diligence, SC, governance drafting etc.) that is needed to make changes to the protocol. At the end of the day it\u2019s quite possible that it\u2019s not worth investing in our meme. We can continue to drive growth and not worry what opportunities and exceptions are circulating around us, but I think the general Maker ethos is one that is willing to pull back the curtain and explore the possibility that we could be functioning much better. Here are some ideas I had on how we could explore this topic further:  Working group to explore crypto \u201cbailouts\u201d (de)Central Bank Core Unit: a cross section of talent exploring further profits through traditional finance practices Expanding Gov Coms, Marketing, or Growth Core Units to focus on DAO to DAO (or B2B) communication. Media blitz highlighting how other projects can use Maker to fund growth, respond to a crisis  I think I\u2019m on the cusp of a valuable thought here and I\u2019d like to leverage the collective intelligence of the community to see if there really is an opportunity or if it\u2019s just an exercise in exploring different use-cases for vaults. If you\u2019ve taken the time to read this your opinion is super valuable and I\u2019d appreciate your comments and concerns! How do you feel about the Maker as a (de)central bank meme? ",

Identify beforehand which assets have value (which is already being done with onboarding various collateral), and then have some kind of idea of what the hypothetical \u201cMaker Put\u201d would be. That is, what extremely favorable terms would be acceptable to take on the role of recapitalizing another project? And how would that look different from simply collateralizing into a normal DAI loan now? ",

As far as the bank meme goes, I hope @layerzero will eventually be able to give us a better sense of where that could become problematic but I do think we should embrace it and I like the idea of a group exploring what that means. I don\u2019t know that it needs to be a Core Unit but I think a working group would be helpful.

Small loans to enable short-term access to capital as is the case for YFI makes sense. Size is limited by the liquidity/risk characteristics of the collateral. This makes sense for the Maker Protocol to engage in and is a win-win. This is not how I would define a bailout. At the risk of sounding alarmist and creating mountains out of mole-hills in a thread that is about memes, I\u2019d like to engage in this discussion around bailouts so humor me. What frightens me is a bailout where the Maker Protocol extends more credit than a collateral token can safely secure, thereby transferring risk to MKR token holders. The extreme example of this scenario is a protocol diluting their token supply to use as collateral in the Maker Protocol to take out a substantial amount of Dai. Recapitalizing \u201cbroken\u201d companies is something central banks do out of necessity, not because they \u201cwant\u201d to. The Maker Protocol should be extremely careful about the purpose of emulating this behavior. In particular if we find ourselves in the scenario where the Maker Protocol feels it \u201cneeds\u201d to bailout a DAO because of the Maker Protocol\u2019s existing exposure to that DAO on our balance sheet. This is a sign that the Maker Protocol already suffered from overexposure to said DAO, and not a good argument for \u201cdoubling down\u201d to avoid realizing short-term losses. This a slippery slope. What can seem like clever and prudent financial engineering in the short-term is really just increasing the size of the problem and kicking the can down the road. ",

I\u2019m really interested in the Core Unit you propose. I\u2019ve had an idea around this for a while. Please bear in mind I am not a coder so am not sure how difficult the following would be. I imagine MakerDAO could be a combination of the S&P500 and a broker. Imagine the DAO selecting indices across a wide range of crypto and tradFI (once adopted to the ETH ecosytem). For example a MKR50 where we choose 50 projects to index by market-cap and end-users can pay DAI in exchange for an ERC-20 representing the underlying assets. The DAI could then be used by the protocol to buy the assets on DEXes and add to an asset pool controlled by the DAO. The protocol could then charge a management fee for these assets a la Vanguard and open up a new revenue stream. We could even have multiple indices - for example a staked ETH index which included stETH, rETH, bETH etc, all weighted by market-cap, all making it easier for retail investors to stake and smoothing out smart contract risk for individual users. Other examples: uniswap LP index, a DEFI token index (essentially DPI but controlled by a DAO). While this is undoubtedly a complex endeavour I feel if MakerDAO is really about banking the unbanked and becoming the premium DeFI protocol we need to make bold steps like this to diversify income streams, it would also hopefully boost demand and usage of DAI if this is how deposits are required.
