This way I can leave several governance assets on loopring and still be able to vote by interacting with snapshot L1?   Yes, this will be possible + the more people who want to do the same thing, the cheaper it is for each person  If this is true, this could be a much cleaner solution for Maker too, wouldn\u2019t it? The idea being that low gas costs would lead to more governance participation. This is a nice complement to governance delegation as detailed in this topic. @krzkaczor, I know you\u2019re an L2 expert here - do you have a clearer idea of whether this could work for Maker voting too?

You probably have a much clearer picture of what Maker has already done to move to L2 than I do. For me, the main things that stood out were that Loopring is going to make it very easy to piggyback on their platform (of course, this implies that we need to trust that their L2 is secure) and being a zk-rollup, the security guarantees should be better than any optimistic rollup solution.
