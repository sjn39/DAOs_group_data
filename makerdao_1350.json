                    "content": "  Note: This is an urgent request to expedite a MIP6 & PSM launch for BUSD to diversify DAI\u2019s collateral backing. DAI is backed nearly entirely by a single centralized collateral in a defaulting environment.    TLDR   >80% of DAI is backed by USDC.  USDC may or may not be compromised.  Surprisingly, large players have been mismanaging customer funds, going under, and defaulting. It is feasible that Circle may have mismanaged USDC.   >80% of DAI is backed by USDC.  A potential default could be imminent. This would be an existential risk to DAI.      Immediately onboard BUSD as collateral.   BUSD will be a temporary alternative to phase out USDC or at least diversify the risk of single collateral defaulting.    Immediately introduce a PSM for BUSD identical to USDC\u2019s w/ 0% swap fee. Gradually (quickly) deploy all stablecoin backing of DAI.    Why BUSD? What is the urgency? In a defaulting environment, imagine what a shocker it would be\u2026 if it\u2019s discovered that USDC (not Tether, not BUSD)\u2026 but Circle, was the one gambling with their customer\u2019s funds? If Circle is underwater for whatever reason, our entire collateral base could be defaulted on.  We\u2019re ~80% exposed to USDC right now.  BUSD is fairly liquid on-chain. Binance has as good a reputation as anyone else and has been in the space for a long time. Adding BUSD and launching an identical PSM would diversify our backing temporarily. Gradually, we would move off from these kinds of collaterals, but right now, we are too exposed to USDC.  Add 0% PSM for BUSD  Clone the Peg Stability Module with a 0% swap fee for BUSD.  BUSD is slightly less liquid on-chain than USDC but liquid enough to meet our needs.   BUSD will be a good stop-gap while we offload all dependency on centralized stablecoins.

Ok I agree it is urgent  But imo more on the order of solving in the next couple months rather than weeks or days. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that USDC solvency or liquidity is stressed (they have seen huge inflows recently which improve the liquidity situation if anything). There\u2019s also another aspect to this - will diversifying risk actually help Maker survive?  US govt censorship will likely apply to all centralized USD stablecoin issuers so I dont think this offers meaningful protection against regulatory risk If we onboard BUSD, but our USDC holdings remain very high (eg $1 billion or more), we may still have existential level exposure to USDC counterparty/credit risk while also adding existential exposure to BUSD (Paxos credit risk + Binance key management)  Definitely still think we should onboard BUSD and support the signal generally, just not the \u201cimmediate\u201d part.

But as we currently are, we will be existentially exposed to a few counterparties in the near term.  We have to accept this as a fact and just work to diversify in a levelheaded manner.  But it might be wise to wait for all the market turmoil to clear out before going on this path.  In an environment where there is uncertainty of who might fail next and who might be exposed to failures, being exposed to the strongest assets out there like usdc and treasuries is actually the best position to be in.  You can diversify yourself to 100 counterparties but if we get into a deep global recession, you\u2019re going to start taking losses on the weakest of those counterparties. ",
