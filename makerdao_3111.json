                    "content": "Recently, I read Debt: The First 5000 Years, and The Fraying of the Petrodollar System. This has led to me thinking a lot about the nature of currency, and the way that currency systems can embody core contradictions that lead to their downfall. I\u2019m worried that DAI contains such a contradiction, and that it will create a long-term crisis if it\u2019s not addressed. The contradiction exists between the following three statements:  DAI is a currency. Every DAI is backed by at least $1 worth of high-quality collateral The price of DAI is pegged to be equal to $1  (See past discussion: [Poll] Should MakerDAO print unbacked DAI to solve the peg issue?) I believe that these three statements form an economic trilemma. The issue is that the value of a currency is always higher than the objective value \u201cbacking\u201d the currency. That\u2019s because currencies become valuable by virtue of their being currencies. There is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop\u2013a network effect\u2013which makes the currency valuable. Consider the example of gold. Gold is objectively valuable: it\u2019s soft, malleable, conductive, pretty, etc. However, that objective value is a tiny fraction of its economic value. Almost all of its economic value is derived from the reliable expectation, confirmed by centuries of history and precedent, that other humans will find gold valuable and will want to use it as a currency. Other currencies (like dollars or Bitcoin) have even less objective value, but still command large valuations, entirely because they are accepted as currencies. We can encode this observation into math as follows: (Value of an asset used as currency) = (Objective own-value of the asset) + (Network value due to its use as a currency) Applying it to DAI: (Value of one DAI) = (Value of collateral backing 1 DAI) + (Per-unit value from DAI\u2019s use as a currency) From the examples of other currencies like gold, dollars, or bitcoin, we can expect that the \u201cValue From Being A Currency\u201d may become much larger than \u201cValue of Collateral Backing\u201d. However, if we try to hold the price of DAI to be equal to $1, then we are in trouble. The \u201cobjective\u201d value of something backed by $1 of collateral should be close to $1. Then let\u2019s imagine, very conservatively, that the \u201cvalue from being a currency\u201d is only 1x of the objective value (even though for gold, dollars, etc, the true ratio is enormously higher). Plugging this into our equation, we arrive at: (Price of DAI = $1) = (Value of collateral backing = $1) + (Value of DAI as currency = $1) Since 1+1 != 1, there\u2019s a contradiction here. The problem will manifest as the price of DAI consistently creeping above its peg, as excess currency-driven demand pushes the price up. In response, Maker will be forced to add larger and larger amounts of riskier collateral, in order to ensure that the supply will keep up with demand. The only way to get the equation to truly work will be to erode the value of the collateral towards zero; at that point, the equation balances: (Price of DAI = $1) = (Value of collateral backing = $0) + (Value of DAI as a currency = $1) This would make DAI into just another fiat currency; one that is backed by nothing other than an expectation that it will be valuable. Also, the version of MakerDAO that maintains the peg by loading up on risk will be much more vulnerable to shocks that could destroy the system. Therefore, I think Maker should abandon the 1 DAI == $1 price peg, but hold onto the rule that 1 DAI is always backed by at least $1 of collateral. The price would start to float higher than $1 (perhaps materially higher over time, especially in a climate of dollar-devaluation), but users of DAI could always sleep easy knowing that the value of their DAI won\u2019t go below $1. This would make holding DAI much more appealing. The holder of DAI would have upside in the case of a weakening dollar (DAI would become over-collateralized and the price would rise), but downside protection in the case of a strong dollar (DAI would never drop below $1). As someone who is long-term bearish on the dollar (see The Fraying of the Petrodollar System), I could really use an asset with these properties. This change would be inconvenient for a certain set of users: users who (for regulatory or tax reasons) need a perfect peg for the U.S. dollar, rather than a stable cryptocurrency in general. However, for those users, I believe DAI is already strictly inferior to USDC. If you\u2019re looking for a perfect dollar peg, then USDC is that, and there\u2019s no reason to take all the additional risk and complexity of MakerDAO. Also, as crypto matures, the U.S. government is nearly certain to apply regulatory pressure to push users towards stable currencies that are de-facto controlled by the U.S. government. Thus, all of the users who most care about the U.S. dollar peg (for regulatory or tax reasons) are users who are likely to be pushed out of the DAI ecosystem over time, anyway. Based on this thread I understand that there\u2019s already regulatory pressure for MakerDAO to break the peg. If we decide to go down this road, we should put some thought into how to maintain price stability without a strict peg. I think doing some expectation-setting would help; e.g. we could target a price growth rate of 3%, and use the DSR as a mechanism to help meet the target. This might seem like it\u2019s compromising on the goal of being a stable currency. However, a system with some short-term price variation will actually be more stable than something with no apparent price volatility, but that is built on a contradiction. If unaddressed, I think the contradiction will eventually trigger a debt crisis that undermines price stability, perhaps permanently. Thanks for reading this post! I know a lot of folks here have a much deeper understanding of DAI than I do, and I look forward to reading your thoughts.  ",

From my perspective as a user \u201cDAI is exchangeable for 1 USD\u201d is the core value prop of DAI, and thus an end-in-itself. \u201cDAI is backed by 1 USD of collateral\u201d is just a means to that end. So if they are in conflict, it seems clear that the DAI backing should be sacrificed, rather than the stable peg. For me, this is not just hypothetical\u2013I run the SourceCred treasury and currently we pay all of our contributors in DAI, but Grain is pegged to USD, so I\u2019ve started needing to do spot currency price conversions every time someone redeems their Grain. It\u2019s a pain. For us to keep using DAI long term, it\u2019s important that Maker finds a way to keep a stable peg.   Since I\u2019ve totally reversed that position, I\u2019ll add a quick explanation. I\u2019ve realized that inasfar as I actually need a currency that is exactly pegged to $1, I should be using USDC, and there\u2019s no practical / incentive compatible reason to use DAI in lieu of USDC as a dollar peg. However, I like MakerDAO and want to keep using and supporting it. But since we\u2019re dealing with a financial asset, there needs to be a rational reason to hold it. Ensuring that DAI is always backed by strong collateral, but also allowing that it will float upwards over time, would make it an asset worth holding in its own right. ",

This non-pegged DAI would still be a valuable asset, much like other cryptocurrencies like ETH, you would be able to use it to buy other crypto or invest in other ventures. However, we can anticipate that it would have much lower volatility than ETH. ETH is \u201cbacked by\u201d the eventual value of the Ethereum network, and that perceived value fluctuates wildly based on the anticipated growth rate and future success of Ethereum. In contrast, DAI is backed by a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. That portfolio will experience lower volatility than Ethereum (since it will be a diversified portfolio including ETH among other things), which will translate to lower volatility for DAI. Thus, for people who want a low-volatility cryptonative asset, it will be more desirable than (say) ETH. ",

I believe there\u2019s at least a close metaphor here to the Impossibility Trilemma of international economics. Basically, it states that a monetary system cannot have the following three properties at the same time:  A fixed foreign exchange rate Free movement of capital Independent monetary policy  We can map this onto a similar trilemma in the Maker/DAI case:  A fixed token price Permissionless ability to open/close CDPs Independent policy on DAI issuance and risk tolerance  Right now Maker is succeeding at having a fixed token price, and entering/exiting the system is mostly permissionless (debt ceilings are kind of an exception). But the independence of Maker\u2019s monetary policy is getting compromised by by maintaining the peg, see this thread of emergency peg management as an example. Basically, because the price was sliding up off peg, Maker was forced to take on more risk than would have otherwise been comfortable, i.e. it sacrificed its monetary authority to preserve the peg. If this contradiction is not fixed, Maker\u2019s monetary autonomy will further erode. The simplest \u201cerrosive path\u201d would be to allow ever-larger amounts of USD stablecoins into Maker, as that will be most effective at stabilizing the USD peg. However, this will make Maker directly vulnerable to coercion by US regulators, who will have the ability to threaten Maker by blacklisting Maker\u2019s addresses in the USD stablecoin contracts. The alternate path would be to stay away from USD stablecoins, and instead risk-load on ever more exotic assets. This path could work for a long time (e.g. Tether is doing OK despite sketchy collateralization) but incurs significant long-term blowup risk. ",

We can use tools like the PSM to maintain the peg but this requires us to hoard large amounts of USDC, which creates its own risks.   My preferred solution to this problem is to issue unbacked dai (i.e. have ~1-2% of DAI be unbacked by collateral or therefore each Dai is backed by $0.98).  This would likely be enough to maintain the peg and we could use the proceeds from issuing unbacked dai to buy assets that are not under central control and countercyclical so that they would gain in value when the cryptomarkets were falling (probably inverse synthethics or maybe put options would be the best), which would be the main reason for Dai to fall below its peg, and then we could use the value of these to buy back Dai if the Dai price went below the peg.

                    "content": "    decentralion:  One of the main theses of Debt: The First 5000 Years is that most currencies are perpetual debts. Consider that early banknotes were debt of the bank, which promised to redeem the note for gold upon receipt. Consider that almost all of the dollars you might have\u2013in a bank account, in a money market fund, or held in t-bills\u2013are also debts (of the bank, fund, or U.S. government).   It depends on your perspective. As bankers, I think money is more precisely outside money, the rest being credit. Outside money is something that doesn\u2019t have a net supply in the considered system. Gold and bitcoin are outside money. The US dollar in the form of FED liability (deposit or notes/coins) is outside money because it is outside of the competitive business. DAI is not a unit of account, $ is. Currently, most algorithmic stablecoins have a value above $1 even when they are backed by nothing. It\u2019s not because of network\u2019s effects. It\u2019s just supply/demand imbalance and the lack of arbitrage. The space is young. I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. I fully agree with your presentation of the impossible trinity. I also already wrote on the link between interest rates and exchange rates (which doesn\u2019t find strong empirical evidence currently, but with all the farming \u2026). ",

You can easily convert DAI to $ going to USDC then an exchange.\u201d Maybe a few million sure, but I am not sure whether Dai can be easily converted at $ billion level right now. Of course, there are ways to use USDC vault or PSM but as they are capped right now, they are akin to capital controls. \u201cIt can as much as anyone else. I don\u2019t know any serious country with a fiat currency issued by a central bank with an insolvent central bank.\" \u201cBut I agree we don\u2019t have control of our monetary policy if we want to keep the peg.\u201d In traditional fixed exchange currency, if their currency is appreciating due to a demand, then the central bank can simply print its currency to keep the peg. As Financial Times noted of Hong Kong Dollar \u201cIf there is demand for the Hong Kong dollar, the currency will test the strong boundary of its tradable range. If this happens, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority steps in and prints as many new Hong Kong dollars as it thinks necessary to depress the interest rate.\u201d However, in the case of the Maker system, there\u2019s no way to print unlimited Dai to buy up for example USDC to keep up the peg at least for now. However, this also shields the system from the opposite problem that many countries faced before, which was in cases when fixed currencies faced depreciations. If the currency is devalued, then the country with devalued currency must \u201csell\u201d its foreign reserve and buy its own currency to bring back the peg. However, only few have foreign reserve that is bigger than its total money supply (as central banks can print its own currency without collaterals backing it). This is very different from the Maker system where every Dai is backed by collaterals. Therefore, at least for now, impossible Trinity doesn\u2019t apply to the Maker system. \u201cDo you have a reference highlighting how banknotes traded at a premium during the gold standard?\u201d To clarify, banknotes were traded at a premium against goods and services. Similar to how appreciated Dai would be able to buy more goods and services. This is considered deflation. There are several researches including this one that might find interesting.   nber.org    c11482.pdf 422.68 KB      \u201cAs noted by Choudhri and Kochin (1980), Spain\u2019s abstention from the gold standard insulated that country from the general deflation; New Zealand and Australia, presumably because they retained links to sterling despite early abandonment of the strict gold standard, did however experience some deflation. Among countries on the gold standard as of 1931, there is a rather uniform experience of about a 13% deflation in both 1930 and 1931. But after 1931 there is a sharp divergence between those countries on and those off the gold standard. Price levels in countries off the gold standard have stabilized by 1933 (with one or two exceptions), and these countries experience mild inflations in 1934-36. In contrast, the gold standard countries continue to deflate, although at a slower rate, until the gold standard\u2019s dissolution in 1936\u201d Here\u2019s a chart that you can see the difference more clearly. You can see that starting in 1971 when President Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard, inflation increases rapidly (inflation was already happening before the official declaration as the government relaxed rules to expand monetary supply to deal with its overvalued dollar). 1044\u00d7732 71.4 KB ",
