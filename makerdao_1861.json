                    "content": "[Signal Request] The SHCU Requests a One-Month Budget Extension   Are Signal Requests still a thing these days? I don\u2019t think the latest polls have concluded yet, so I assume they are\u2026 but this may be one of our last!     Overview Due to reasons:  The SHCU is requesting a one-time distribution for a one-month budget extension.  SHCU Annual Budget:  770,000 DAI [Current] 62.5 MKR   Monthly Pro-Rated Stream:  64,167 DAI [Current] 5.21 MKR   Signal Request Limitations:  50,000 DAI [Arbitrary]   Requested Amount for this SR:   49,999.99 DAI [Adjusted For Arbitrary Constraints] 5.21 MKR        Farewell? My time is up on Monday. I know it\u2019s my time to go. I\u2019ve made peace with that\u2026 but deep down, I just don\u2019t want to let go just yet.   DevCon DevCon was great. I got to see so many faces again. Share our merch with the LATAM community, our team, and all the other attendees that flew in from across the world for this event. Sure, maybe I didn\u2019t have a swag truck like AAVE did. It\u2019s hard to knock on them for that\u2026 but truthfully? I\u2019m not sure how many people I saw showing off their AAVE swag.  Ours though?    The looks on everyone\u2019s faces when they\u2019d get their hands on one of our (throwback) hats or fannies, or cinch bags. That alone was priceless  These people love Maker. They love DAI\u2026 and the little bit of merch they received? It means the world to them. You can just see it in their eyes. Each item is something they\u2019ll treasure for life. They\u2019ll proudly show it off to all their friends for years to come. You can\u2019t put a price tag on that. Somehow I managed to get 15 duffel bags through customs!  Did anyone know you can check 15 bags?  Turns out, you can check as many as you want! lol And since they were \u201cregalos\u201d\u2026 $300 (and 3.5 hours of my time) was enough to keep our friends at customs satisfied. As counterintuitive as it may sound, it\u2019s cheaper than shipping. You\u2019re also guaranteed that it will arrive when you arrive.      The Request So, back to my SR\u2026 Our event next in Barcelona is around the corner, ETH-Gathering. Everyone from our team is going. (I\u2019ve even heard rumors that the legend himself may or may not be there!) I hope the DAO does not mind that taken the liberty to pre-funded a portion of the arrangements for this event from my budget. Of course, not in its entirety. If I\u2019m to go purely by the rule of \u201ccode is law\u201d or whatever, I have no obligation to fulfill any more requests beyond Monday\u2026 but, alas, that\u2019s not me. Whether or not I\u2019ll be running on fumes, whether or not I get paid, I\u2019ve made promises, set expectations, and I intend to follow through on them. It wouldn\u2019t be my first nor my last time I work for no pay. Something about being passionate about the project or something? Beats me lol It took a while for people in our community to ask for compensation or salary at all in the first place! Anyway, there\u2019s a few cool things I\u2019d like to deliver for this event (and one in Lisbon happening in a few days). This little budget extension will let me deliver on one of my final Happiness Drops for our community. (I invite all to attend!)  Don\u2019t Be Shy! The drop ship to everyone that gave me their addresses a little while back should be shipping out this week. I have approximately 40-60 addresses logged to send out to 200250 recipients. That one was primarily geared towards domestic recipients to avoid customs issues. Anyone abroad that will also be in Barcelona, shoot me a DM with any special requests, and I\u2019ll do my best to get it to you in Europe!    Poll Details  Transfers  49,999.99 DAI will be transferred to:   StrategicHappiness.eth: SHCU Operational Wallet   The SHCU Golden Parachute:  Distribution will be delayed by 31 days. No additional DAI is requested. An additional 5.21 MKR will be added to the severance package.  This sum represents the pro-rated vest over an additional month and is based on previously approved terms outlined in the SHCU\u2019s onboarding MIPS.   The address for Golden Parachute distribution will remain TBD.    No matter how this SR goes, the SHCU will still be officially offboarded as per the Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3), assuming 100k+ MKR doesn\u2019t magically show up to overturn the current breakdown. However, if this poll passes, the SHCU will continue to exist in spirit and be funded for one more month, after which I, your Shitpost Facilitator, will step down, relinquish my role as a Mandated Actor, and return to my former role as \u201cMaker Community Member.\u201d     Extend The SHCU\u2019s Existence by One Month?   Yes: Transfer 49,999.99 DAI to the SHCU operational wallet and add one month of pro-rated MKR (5.21) vest to the SHCU Golden Parachute.  No: Stop flipping votes and leave already. Abstain      0 voters     This poll will run until October 28th. 2022-10-22T04:00:00Z\u21922022-10-28T15:11:00Z If successful, an on-chain vote will be held to confirm the changes.  Next Steps  I make some dope swag for ya\u2019ll      Edit From some of the comments and messages re this SR, it seems that some of those among us are worried about formatting and technicalities. Why an SR? Not an SPF? What was he thinking? Also, didn\u2019t he realize that throwing in that MKR would throw off everything? This SR can\u2019t possibly go to vote like this! Unfortunately, the five-minute window for changes passes by a lot faster than anyone could fathom. Anyway, if I take this SR down, that spoils all the fun! We should test our system\u2019s resiliency, no? If the 5.21 MKR is some kind of deal breaker, send it to this address instead:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000    ",

Edit posted     aburban90:  Edit From some of the comments and messages re this SR, it seems that some of those among us are worried about formatting and technicalities. Why an SR? Not an SPF? What was he thinking? Also, didn\u2019t he realize that throwing in that MKR would throw off everything? This SR can\u2019t possibly go to vote like this! Unfortunately, the five-minute window for changes passes by a lot faster than anyone could fathom. Anyway, if I take this SR down, that spoils all the fun! We should test our system\u2019s resiliency, no? If the 5.21 MKR is some kind of deal breaker, send it to this address instead:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000      ",

At the time of posting, SH-001 was still an active CU with a specific mandate from MKR voters for \u201cShitposting\u201d, so I am prepared to allow a little discretion on these grounds for this specific case, or anyone with a similar mandate.

Everyone seems quite concerned about trimming fat and waste in these hard times. Rightfully so, ofc! It\u2019s pretty easy to look at $50k spend on merch and see pure waste. It\u2019s visible (that\u2019s the point! ). On its face, it seems to deliver no tangible benefits. There\u2019s no particularly quantifiable ROI. (Though, I challenge any of you to assign a value to its effect on our brand image and community retention, an effect that persists years and years out). $50k is a rounding error. 5mkr is a rounding error. $1m is a rounding error. You know what\u2019s not a rounding error? Watching 90%+ of our DAO spending their entire budgets worldwide\u2026: on debit cards. No thought given to those little things they call \u201cforeign transaction fees\u201d\u2026 imagine, 3-5% gone, on every swipe, in every country. To the void, silently. Now multiply that across the entirety of our org\u2019s spending. Is that $50k? Is that $500k? Is it an order more? Who knows\u2026 no one tracks it, but it\u2019s not visible, so we don\u2019t care. And before someone tries to say that we should be doing fewer offsites and traveling to bring that number down, I caution against that as well. Offsites are extremely valuable for group cohesion, communication, and developing ideas through serendipity. No, they\u2019re not cheap\u2026 but, they are necessary. We can do some math there as well\u2026 and how much we could collectively save routing through me\u2026 but, I\u2019ll spare it since I\u2019m ranting at this point.  Tldr; Stop focusing on the wrong things. With love, Burban  ",

While their rates earlier on were quite high, they\u2019ve come down to much more sensible ones over time. I forget how much my CU was paying, but iirc, annualized cost for their services including conversion fees, expense tracking, and reporting, would have come out to roughly $30-35k or so? For the freeing of cognitive bandwidth alone, that price seems more than fair to me. While I agree that centralizing all our budgets with one service provider is unwise, Accountable does take on large responsibilities for us, absorbing many of the risks of the grey area this industry is. Also, finding a way to go from DAI to fiat via any route will come at a cost. Through Accountable, through another setup, those losses are a given and ones we may have to just accept for now. Post-conversion however\u2026 how did we come to justify tacking on another 3-5%? ",

In my case, I\u2019ve been regularly submitting detailed expense reports for PnL each month to Strategic Finance and SES. Admittedly, it took a while to get a working system for myself to track and report appropriately, but, once I got that sorted out, all expenses are accounted for, outlined, and submitted each month. As for quantifying ROI, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to assign a numerical value for that. What is the $ value of a merch recipient posting their swag on social media, tagging  us, and sharing that with the internet? We can probably pick numbers out of a hat for that. There\u2019s clearly value there, but\u2026 quantifying it? I\u2019m a mechanical engineer, I don\u2019t have a marketing background. I\u2019m sure marketing firms have all sorts of mystical ways to assign values for these things to sell their services to clients. I\u2019m sure most of their numbers are fiction anyway, (with grains of truth ofc). ",

Ofc, if scaled linearly, that number might be closer to $300k for a $10m budget (assuming 100% of the budget is converted to fiat). May there be some wiggle room for negotiations at that price? Maybe\u2026 but do we even have any CUs with those size budgets? In particular, ones that size that convert 100% of their budget to fiat? And since zero is off the table, what conversion rate do others consider tolerable? Edit: And of course, on top of the discounted conversation rate, the number would have to include the cost of hiring an internal accountant to fill the role of the services offered by AccountAble.

Yes I remember the good old days when we had a lot of cool Maker swag with innovative quotes and catchy lines. This was before SCHU time. Printing old phrases and the logo on a variety of different overpriced items does not = to good swag imo.

Quality > quantity      aburban90:  heat-transferred vinyl merch\u2026 sure, it looks nice the first or second time you wear it. After a few washes though, the vinyl cracks apart.

Of course, you\u2019ll save money if f cutting corners is your primary objective. \u2014\u2014 You can cut corners all day and save money galore.

Ofc, I could have gone ahead and handed them out anyway\u2026 no one would have noticed, not right away at least. The money spent was a sunk cost, but I had to make a judgment call. There is no worse look for our brand\u2019s image than merch representing a lack of regard for care, utility, and longevity\u2026 an effect that would be noticed months later, and reflect accordingly on our image. It\u2019s beneath my standards, and it should be a value shared across our community. It\u2019s a judgement call AAVE\u2019s team chooses to make, and I respect their decision, but it\u2019s not one I would feel comfortable with for myself, nor for our brand. ",
