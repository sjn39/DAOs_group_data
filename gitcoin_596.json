We have taken onboard your feedback in relation to donations to the DAO and have amended the \u2018Revenue\u2019 line to reflect more accurately that these are in fact donations. This month we have incorporated a consolidated financial statement report which shows both GTC transactions and stable coins. This shows both inflow and outflow in USD terms. Noting that we have used the month-end spot rate to translate GTC. Key highlights  Gitcoin treasury has grown 93.3% from $40.2m to $77.7m as a result of positive price movement in $GTC Total contributor rewards were $644.6k in October up 218% from September The grant for CLR.Fund was paid out in October totaling 40,000 GTC or $340.8k using month end spot rate. CLR.Fund is another prominent Quadratic Funding project in the Ethereum ecosystem with a mission/ethos that is similar to Gitcoin.

Due to a significant rise in token value to $17.13 at the month-end Total contributor rewards were up in USD terms by 173% to $1.12m, however, net outflows of GTC are down from last month suggesting the increase is due to a slight rise in stable coin denominated payments and also the rise in token price FDD had the largest workstream spend in relation to contributor rewards totaling 19,750 GTC.

To provide a little more detail: the working group is still actively working on the diversification, but the process has been slower than we initially expected for a few reasons. Most notably, market conditions weakened over the past few months and demand for publicly traded governance tokens from institutional partners slowed down. Kyle has written about this in more detail in the thread linked above. We\u2019re still in talks with potential partners and are exploring alternative mechanisms that will allow Gitcoin DAO to have stables in the treasury. I agree with your final point; during the next bull run we should proactively think about diversifying the treasury to protect against drops in GTC. ",

And why use end-of-april GTC prices but a latest transfer date of May 18th 2022 (slide 4)? This GTC price decision significantly changes the treasury outlook from having $40.4M to $23.7M (a >40% reduction). Could you also share more details about why the treasury diversification into stables could not occur in April or sooner? Llama\u2019s first post about treasury diversification (proposing swapping $15M of GTC into stables, which was at the time 24% of the treasury and is now 63%) is from January 13th. Based on the thread, perhaps it has been a slow search for institutional partners. I am confused why \u2018institutional partners\u2019 are needed at all to swap GTC into DAI or USDC (this may be my ignorance). An earlier diversification could have resulted in a much better treasury outlook than we now face. ",

Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite as easy as simply swapping GTC into DAI or USDC; while Gitcoin DAO might have been able to get some stables by doing so, there is not enough liquidity to do so on-chain in a timely fashion. Had we swapped GTC on the open market, we would have experienced material slippage and a negative price impact on GTC. Further, selling GTC in the open market would have resulted in the token ending up in the hands of short-term holders; the benefit of working with institutional partners is that we can select partners who are aligned and long-term oriented.

What financial forecasting needs does the DAO have + how can they been more deeply met by reporting?\u201d  Llama\u2019s best work has been on-chain, financially sophisticated actions that it doesn\u2019t make sense for a DAO to work on internally. For example, we are working on securing a Tokemak reactor for Gitcoin. The nature of the financial, technical, and governance work needed to secure and manage that process makes Llama better equipped to work on this versus the average Gitcoin contributor. We\u2019ve implemented on-chain proposals, constructed treasury strategies, designed liquidity incentive programs and on-chain indices, and built analytics dashboards and financial reports. Examples of what we\u2019ve worked on for Gitcoin:  Improve GTC liquidity with Tokemak Proposal to liquidate AKITA partly via sale and Sablier stream Financial statements  Examples of what we\u2019ve worked on for other DAOs:  Consolidate reserve factors and enable DPI borrowing on Aave Strategic partnership between Aave and Balancer Uniswap liquidity program v0.1 PoolTogether proposal on tokenomics and alternative capital structures FWB liquidity improvement plan & escrow contract Fei analytics dashboard CVX asset listing Forge template for Aave proposal payloads Harvest analytics dashboard  On how best to use Llama to serve Gitcoin: While we could work on one-off proposals for Gitcoin, I think entering into a longer-term 6-month contract could help accomplish more with a longer term, dedicated focus. A Llama team of engineers and DeFi strategists could be focused on few core areas for the DAO:  Increasing revenue to Gitcoin\u2019s treasury Improving liquidity for GTC token Growing Gitcoin\u2019s treasury and making it productive / earning yield Hedging the treasury against extreme downside risk Accruing metagovernance power in other protocols Building analytics dashboards and financial statements to inform the DAO Building a runway analysis report based on budget proposals (example from last month below)   1480\u00d7558 64.4 KB     On our monthly report: I\u2019ve heard from Gitcoin members that our monthly report is useful. However, so far, it has not gotten enough attention and visibility to the rest of the DAO. For example, I think the chart below should be shown in monthly steward calls and help inform voter decisions on approving quarterly budgets.  1600\u00d7598 198 KB  TLDR We think we can best serve Gitcoin\u2019s treasury with some type of longer-term arrangement that can align Llama and Gitcoin.

I just recently vented a bit to fellow wildfire folks in the last week about the challenges I think everyone likely feels about getting a sense of the context of a DAO before making suggestions or providing feedback on proposals and discussions.  The work you are doing w/ Llama obviously is promising.  That said we are still a little ways away from having a broadly adopted \u201cdefacto standard\u201d way of looking at DAO health and areas of activity, right?  What I\u2019m getting at is do you think we in GitCoin and DAOs more broadly DO have such a fairly well-accepted way of examining DAO health yet or is this an area you feel needs more work - or is the question moot? Secondarily - I asked below about means to assess treasury sensitivity to diversification.  Do you know of a model for predicting slippage?  I would guess you and fellow LLamas would be a good group to ask  ",

As with previous months, the statements are split into transactions denoted in the governance token GTC and separate transactions in stablecoins. We have also included a consolidated profit/(loss) account that translates the GTC transactions into $USD to allow for comparison in a denomination that is easily relatable to many reading the report. This month\u2019s iteration has undergone some design changes to improve the readability of the report, coupled with taking onboard some feedback from the community. You will also notice we have included a list of wallet address\u2019 used to prepare the report for auditing purposes. Highlights  Total $ value of contributor rewards is down 5.7% MoM. This is a direct result of timing differences in payments made to contributors cross workstreams. This can be seen in the screenshot below with the Moonshot collective making payment to contributors just after month end, hence not included in this report.

What else is Llama doing to support Gitcoin? Llama is currently working with the Gitcoin team to prepare a detailed Budget vs Actual view of contributor rewards payments over the last 6 months. We will post this analysis within this Financial reporting thread in due course. In addition to this we are also preparing a detailed runway analysis of GTC and also the organisations stablecoin needs over the next 2 year period. Watch this space\u2026 ",

Highlights  Total $ value of contributor rewards is up 76% MoM, which is a direct result of timing differences in payment made to contributors from differing workstreams.
