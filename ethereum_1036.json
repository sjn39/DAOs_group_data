Simple Summary A set of interfaces to save an SVG image in Ethereum, and to retrieve the image file from Ethereum for universal tokens. Abstract This set of interfaces allow a smart contract to save an SVG image in Ethereum and to retrieve an SVG image from Ethereum for fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens and tokens based on standards that will be developed in the future. The interface set has two interfaces: one to save an SVG file in Ethereum and the other to retrieve an SVG file from Ethereum. Typical applications include but not limited to: A solution for storage of a fungible token\u2019s icon. A solution for storage of a non-fungible token\u2019s icon. A solution for storage of the icon/logo of a DAO\u2019s reputation token. Motivation The ERC-721 token standard is a popular standard to define a non-fungible token in Ethereum. This standard is widely used to specify a cryto gift, crypto medal, crypto collectible etc. The most famous use case is the [cryptokitty]. In most of these applications an image is attached to an ERC-721 token. For example, in the cryptokitty case each kitty has a unique image. While the token\u2019s code is saved in Ethereum permenantly, the image attached to the token is not. The existing solutions still keep such an image in a centralized server instead of Ethereum. When these applications display an image for a token they retrieve the token\u2019s information from Ethereum and seach the centralized server for the token\u2019s associated image by using the token\u2019s information. Although this is an applicable way to display an image for a token, the image is still vulnerable to risks of being damaged or lost when saved in a centralized server. Hence we propose a set of interfaces to save an image for a universal token in Ethereum to keep the image permenant and tamper-resistant, and to retrieve an image for a universal token from Ethereum. Definitions tokenId: for a non-fungible token such as an ERC-721 token or a multi-token such as an ERC-1155 token which has a member \u201cID\u201d to specify its token type or token index our proposed interface assigns an SVG image\u2019s file content to a string variable of the token\u2019s contract and  associates the SVG image to this \u201cID\u201d number. This unique ID is used to access its SVG image in both a \u201cset\u201d operation and a \u201cget\u201d operation. For a fungible token such as an ERC-20 token no such an ID is needed and our proposed interface just assigns an SVG image\u2019s file content to a string variable of the token\u2019s contract. This is an ongoing project. We really need and welcome any help. ",

For a decentralized token, you likely want to set the image once at token deployment time and it would never change.  With ENS you will need a mechanism to ensure that regular payments are made to ENS to maintain the record, or you would need to pay for an arbitrary number of years in advance.  All in all, I think ENS isn\u2019t a great fit because there is no real need to update, and if there is a need to update it can be built into the contract and integrated directly with the token\u2019s management code rather than having to use an external system and pay for it. What would be nice is if ENS provided a free option for reverse lookup TXT records, but that is something for the ENS team to think about.   ",

And by the way, Etherscan has a thing called Public Name Tag, that makes it very helpful when looking at transactions log. I wish they could get a contract Public Name Tag from the contract public name string, instead of we having to create private tags or using ENS\u2026 ",

There are a few points and concerns to be said:  XSS attack - SVGs allows the use of javascript. So someone could add a malicious code in it. It could be prevented by just using <img> tags, here is an example of when javascript inside SVG is ran or not: https://csplite.com/csp/test376/  URI pointing to a very big image just to troll, maybe to microsoft hosted windows.iso or ubuntu.iso, people would just be wasting bandwidth. For solutions, maybe we would have to add a javascript code to verify the file extension, or for a gigabyte jpeg, it could be done as mentioned in this stackoverflow post.  ",
