                    "content": "Hi all, At the end of last year, this signal request polled the community for guidance on a framework for setting D3M parameters. Specifically, the bar (target borrow rate) and line (maximum debt exposure) parameters were gauged based on market utilization and competitive positioning versus Maker\u2019s core vaults. With the recent completion of the merge and declining stETH risk factors paving the way for potential reactivation of the Aave D3M, it\u2019s a good time to revisit this framework and see if the community would support changes.  Context The previous signal request, ratified by Maker holders in an on chain poll, set guidance as follows: Debt ceiling (line): Up to 30% of real DAI supplied (excluding recursively borrowed and supplied DAI from calculations). Target borrow rate (bar): Up to 0.5% below ETH-A stability fee, including impact of liquidity incentives on DAI borrowed, and incentives and earnings on supplied ETH collateral assuming 200% collateral ratio. Due to significant increase in ETH supply rates, caused by the onboarding of stETH collateral at Aave and corresponding leveraged staking strategies, the bar parameter guidance framework is currently highly restrictive against deploying funds into the Aave D3M. With supply rates hovering around 0.9%, the current calculation offsets borrowing costs on Aave by 1.8%. The end result is that the bar parameter supported by existing guidance would be ~1.3% above Maker\u2019s ETH-A stability fee (ETH-A stability fee - 0.5% allowed spread + 1.8% yield earned on ETH collateral at Aave). Aave\u2019s DAI borrow rate is currently at ~2.75%, so a bar of 2.8% with existing guidance would not result in any DAI deployed. While the guidance on bar is intended to maintain competitiveness of Maker\u2019s core vaults such as ETH-A, market dynamics indicate that it may not be accurately reflecting user preferences and rate comparisons. The effective DAI borrow rate calculated with the current formula at Aave is ~0.95%, well below Maker\u2019s ETH-A rate. If users were comparing these rates strictly on a like for like basis, we\u2019d expect to see more significant movement of users from Maker vaults to Aave. This may be explained by significant qualitative differences in risk profile. Aave aWETH collateral can be borrowed while Maker ETH vault collateral cannot, which exposes Aave users to tail risk of losing collateral due to a variety of factors: oracle problems, failure of any individual collateral asset on Aave, and indirect exposure to slashing or technical issues with Lido stETH backing outstanding aWETH loans.  Polls Given that collateral supplied pooled lending markets such as Aave and Compound is exposed to significant additional risk compared with Maker, the community can consider altering rate comparison calculations used to set the bar parameter to exclude yield and liquidity incentives earned on user collateral. Poll #1: Adjust collateral yield weighting within competitive rate calculations for D3M     Remove ETH supply yield and liquidity incentives from comparison Continue to count yield and incentives on ETH collateral (no change) Abstain     0 voters     If Maker removes yield earned on collateral from calculations, it may be suitable to adjust the allowed spread between D3M bar (target borrow rate) parameters and ETH-A stability fee. This would ensure that Maker doesn\u2019t give undue advantage to usage of external protocols instead of Maker vaults. Inclusion of any changes to maximum spread from the below poll is contingent on a positive result to the poll above (if a majority of forum voters support making no changes in the above poll, the following poll will be disregarded). This parameter is intended to provide a lower limit to bar parameters proposed by MOMC. The MOMC can always propose a higher spread with bar(but not go below the one voted by Governance). Poll #2: Adjust allowed spread between bar (target borrow rate) and ETH-A stability fee     1% (implies bar of 2.5%, 21 million DAI exposure, 250,000 annual revenue) 0.75% (implies bar of 2.25%, 51 million DAI exposure, 490,000 annual revenue) 0.5% (implies bar of 2%, 90 million DAI exposure, 680,000 annual revenue) 0% (implies bar of 1.5%, 105 million DAI exposure at 30% real supply cap, 730,000 annual revenue) -0.5% (implies bar of 1%, 105 million DAI exposure at 30% real supply cap, 730,000 annual revenue) Abstain     0 voters     (Note that the existing guidance is -0.5%, but if a change is adopted in poll #1 the resulting bar from this maximum spread would be significantly different that the status quo. Due to this dynamic, the -0.5% option is not marked as \u201cno change\u201d.) The risk core unit and MOMC remain confident in the prior guidance of limiting D3M line (maximum debt ceiling) to 30% of real DAI supplied to mitigate potential withdrawal and liquidity risk, so no polls for changes to line are included in this signal request. If other community members feel that a change in guidance is warranted, they are welcome to start a signal request to change guidance on this parameter.  Next Steps This signal request will run for 2 weeks, ending on 6 October 2022. If forum voters support changes, an on chain poll will be submitted the following week. MOMC may include an option in the upcoming parameter changes proposal for October that includes changes to Aave D3M bar outside of previously approved guidance. If such an option is considered, the committee will also submit at least one other parameter change proposal option that continues to conform to prior D3M guidance. This would give the Maker community the opportunity to deploy DAI into the Aave D3M in October, while this signal request is still being considered. ",

Voting on this Signal will run until 2022-10-06.  If Poll #1 has over 50% support from non-abstaining votes, the question will be brought to MKR Voters on Monday, September 10.  If Poll #1 has over 50% support from non-abstaining votes AND at least one option from Poll #2 does as well, the qualified items from Poll #2 will also be polled on 2022-10-10.  If multiple items advance from Poll #2, they will be formatted in a separate poll using approval voting.*  If Poll #1 does not advance, no further action will be taken regardless of the vote on Poll #2.  Poll #1 asks the community to \u201cAdjust collateral yield weighting within competitive rate calculations for D3M\u201d  Voting for \u201cRemove ETH supply yield and liquidity incentives from comparison\u201d represents a change to the status quo, and if approved by MKR holders would result in the MakerDAO Open Market Committee removing the ETH supplier\u2019s yield and AAVE liquidity incentives from their calculations for setting the bar (Target Borrow Rate).    Poll #2 asks the community to \u201cAdjust allowed spread between the bar (target borrow rate) and ETH-A stability fee.\u201d Note this poll is only relevant if Poll #1 passes the signal stage.  Because this poll is dependent on Poll #1, any non-abstain option will represent a change to the status quo. Thus, if Poll #1 advances, all options with more than 50% support from non-abstaining voters will be bundled into a separate poll. This spread is intended to help the MakerDAO Open Market Committee determine if changes should be recommended to the D3M during their monthly recommendations.
