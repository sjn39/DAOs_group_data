After implementing liquid mining, our interest rates will also rise. Use daily income to repurchase MKR and then allocate it to lenders. Maintain a balance between income and expenditure. Equivalent to 0 interest rate, but the effect will be better than 0 interest rate. If the MKR tokens come from the Maker Foundation, then I admire their bravery and dedication. ",
