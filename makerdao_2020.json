Instead, it\u2019s all a question of decentralization, and the number one way to reduce the regulatory attack surface is to ensure real decentralization is in place. The endgame plan delivers this for Maker Core through voter incentives, and the SubDAOs inherit the decentralization of Maker Core since their own governance execution runs on top of Maker Core defined by the processes that will be described in the Endgame Constitution and the Governance Security scope. The clusters that aim to onboard into working for the SubDAOs after they have launched, need to of course have solid legal structures and have their lawyers do important analysis about when actions would go beyond the mandate of facilitating and providing advice for the voters, and risk turning them into an actual operating agent of the SubDAO in the jurisdictions they have exposure to. The 250k structuring startup grant that every cluster gets is supposed to help with resources for this kind of initial work. Eventually, the final stage will be full mandatory pseudonymity of all Maker Core and SubDAO mandated actors, and beyond that point it is possible that the roles would begin to be replaced by AI, enabling an even greater level of decentralization.
