                    "content": " The MakerDAO Announcement Table  Hi, Maker fam! The Brand Team is pleased to present to you the MakerDAO Announcement Table. Since we are currently working to coordinate all of the major MakerDAO announcements for our Twitter and media audience, we created a workflow that treats each announcement as a project, and whose documentation process is publicly updated through this Notion database called MakerDAO Announcement Table. You will be able to access this public table via announcements.makergrowth.com  image - 2022-05-09T145846.6821909\u00d7853 121 KB  For transparency purposes towards the DAO and Core Units, we made public this table, so that anyone who wants to be informed about the upcoming announcements that the Brand Team is working on, can do so through this table with clear information. This is also helpful for coordination between CUs because all teams will be informed and updated about all these announcements.  How does this table work?  The table is composed of different pages. Each page represents one announcement. In addition to that, each announcement has different properties:   Priority: It\u2019s a number from 5 to 1 that defines the priority level of the announcement. 1 is highest priority, 5 is lowest priority. Priority will change according to the timeline of each announcement.   Name: The name to identify the announcement.   Type: This answers the question of where this announcement is coming from. This allows us to understand where to find updates on product and governance processes and where to find resources for creating content.   Content status: The status of the overall announcement process from the Brand Team.   Launch status: The release status of the product, partnership, integration, or deployment to be announced.   Next step: The next phase the Content Team is looking forward to or working on within the announcement process.   Last update resource: Link to a resource that will help the Content Team understand the last resource to refer to for information on the deployment to be announced.   Assets: Communication assets to be developed for each announcement.   Deployment date: Tentative launch date of the product, partnership, integration, or deployment to be announced.   Announcement date: Tentative date to execute the announcement.   If you click the \u201cOpen\u201d button right next to each announcement\u2019s name, you\u2019ll find information about what will be announced and several milestones that will separate the announcement into different tasks. *It should be noted that this announcement table is filtered to display public information only. Behind this, we are also working on announcements that contain confidential information (e.g. partnerships the Growth CU BD team is working on). Those confidential announcements will eventually go public and then show up on this public table when the information is no longer confidential. We\u2019re always open to suggestions, comments, or feedback.  6eplC4HlXm8x5Hs8o8scKuKHVuKOCUhEzOEkwIklhRbcOauJ6qSRl84yGdHIYkqvNJsoPVqo3or4f3tL-jezsREiw8U1ewIspWPt48Fgbr0ZlxICgT58Xye_sev8bMb_iLQXZ5N5960\u00d7960 253 KB  ",
