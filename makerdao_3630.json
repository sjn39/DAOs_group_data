                    "content": "Hi Doo, As you mentioned, the community leads are all in the transition away from the Foundation, and coverage has been minimal because of it. I would imagine that whatever PR/MKTG/Comms core unit that is voted to run social media, would have telegram fold under it. Seeing as you were an admin for it up until a week or so ago, you\u2019re well aware that the conversation there has never been as productive/effective as other channels, such as rocket, the forum, or twitter. Background: The most frequent issues are support requests that a core unit will need to be prepared to handle, and a boatload of spam whenever the price of MKR changes significantly. Note: The Community Leads have never taken part in discussing the price of MKR which is usually the most interesting topic for people, and therefore admins look like they\u2019re missing. As it relates to spam, numerous bots have been tried over the years to prevent it, but they tend to go offline frequently, leading to an influx of bad links/promos. Moving forward: Any PR/MKTG/Comms core unit should be prepared to inherit telegram and all other channels for Maker. Whether they deem telegram useful (vs. say, starting a Discord which could accomplish similar goals) is up to them, but the Foundation will keep it alive until then. The remaining community leads have been reminded to keep the spam in check multiple times. If all CLs are gone to core units or other ventures, we can consider pausing it until a core unit is ready to step in, because I think we all know the spam doesn\u2019t reflect well on Maker. ",
