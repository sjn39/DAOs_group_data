Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: There should be a clear path for a grant to be both useful and measurable in its effects. Soft goals like raising awareness are inappropriate, and programs such a user acquisition need to clearly demonstrate that spending is sourcing new users or assets for Optimism, rather than compete within Optimism for the same users/assets. Additionally, there needs to be tight control by Governance Fund representatives when disbursing funds to grantees. In a traditional organization, there would be a full time position tasked with monitoring incoming reports by grantees. That may not be appropriate or possible for Optimism, but handing over large piles of assets without any grant agreement in place needs to end, even if such an agreement is not enforceable legally. Going forward, most grants should be made on a competitive basis. The Grants Council should identify key areas it would like to see improved, and then solicit competition offers from prospective grantees for a finite grant budget. There should still be room for grantees with novel applications to approach Optimism for funding without such a process, but in general, all grants should be competitive unless they are a continuation of a previous grant that has been deemed successful. GFX Labs prefers to take a lifecycle view of grants, where even at the pre-grant stage there is planning for how the grantee will report on their expenses, their measurable effects, and how the grant will wind down. Overall, the common theme is that much of the tedious or less exciting work of grant allocation and  monitoring has not occurred, and GFX Labs is ready to assist with many of those tasks. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? Optimism, like other L1s and L2s, is at its core a new frontier that has been opened for settlement. Within a certain range, technology will not decide which of those L1s and L2s will become useful and which will not. Just like historical frontiers that were opened for settlement, Optimism needs settlers. It is the people and assets finding productive use on Optimism that will determine its ultimate success. This requires bringing in new users and new assets, since it is the activity of this users and assets that create value on Optimism. In general, we would like to see grants that migrate users and assets to Optimism in a way that is targeted and measurable. Governance of Optimism and increasing the usefulness of the OP token are also priorities, but less relevant for this nomination. Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: GFX Labs generally does not hold tokens in its own right, but does have significant delegations on MakerDAO, Hop Protocol, and Uniswap. Please verify that you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct : Yes Please verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council rewards at the end of Season 3: Yes Please verify that you are able to commit 12 hours / week to reviewing grant applications and other Council operations: Yes ",

Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: While StableLab is familiar with technical aspects, StableLab does not have a dedicated technical team yet. However, we have worked with numerous leading protocols, including MakerDAO, Balancer, and Element Finance, among others seen below.  1164\u00d7500 103 KB  We make up for our lack of a technical team with our extensive experience supporting protocols with growth and governance. Having these roles requires us to have a grasp of the technical elements of a protocol. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: DeFi Committee A - Reviewer Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: Alongside our participation in DeFi committee A, some of our team members have been in the space for many years, contributing to DeFi protocols such as MakerDAO and 1Inch. We have first-hand experience in understanding the needs of a protocol and expanding its reach. With a team of full-time governance analysts, we work in multiple protocols and have the privilege of understanding what works and does not. This gives us a bird\u2019s eye view of the ecosystem as we can identify patterns of successful and unsuccessful programs in attracting and retaining users. During our work in various protocols, we have worked with different service providers and can spot opportunities to insert relevant providers to elevate a protocol or network. For example, we introduced ShowKarma to Optimism. We were a consistent responder to proposals in seasons 1 and 2, both on the forums and in DMs, providing feedback when necessary. We are consistent across all platforms and will continue to act as a line of support for protocols in the Optimism ecosystem. Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: We are also the operations lead at Element Finance and have helped build the infrastructure for Element DAO. In doing so, we have worked with external providers to tailor their services for Element Finance, such as reviewing grant proposals and recommending amendments to create a successful proposal. We are also one of the lead domain allocators of the Compound Grants Committee and are working with Questbook to structure the grants program at Compound. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: We expect a successful grant application to demonstrate some of the following:   Clear milestones  Example: Socket     Granular explanations for the amount of funding requested  Example: Rotki     Effective and efficient distribution of grant funds  Example: Hop Protocol & EthernautDAO     Consistent communication with the community  Example: Alchemix & ShowKarma     Clear value-add to the ecosystem  Example: Agora     Achievable goals within a set timeframe  Example: Superfluid     What types of grant applications would you like to see: We are advocates for innovation. Here are some examples of what grants we would like to see:  DAO tooling  Governance Onboarding   \u201cMining\u201d experiments  Governance Mining   Educational initiatives  Technical Non-technical   Community  Marketing Education   Developer tooling  Overall, we believe Optimism has already distributed many grants, and the S3 Grants Council should use this information to identify gaps that need to be addressed. For example, multiple bridges and wallets have been given grants. Unless they are exceptional, we should avoid further funding them and focus on other gaps. Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: We are delegates at various protocols, which you can see on our website. We are also investors in certain protocols.

We have expertise, focus, and we work very well as a team in assigning and reviewing responsibilities, where our delegate remains the leader. Our proposal is also to offer a possibility of carrying out additional tasks in case the sub-committee deems it appropriate, such as organization, additional research, communication, etc. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:  Clear goals KPIs according to the amount requested and the current state of the ecosystem Good value proposition Team behind the project/protocol Sustainability of the project in the long term (tokenomics) Healthy treasury Active, simple and precise communication of the project Be aligned with the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystem And the most important a spectrum of decentralization identifiable and minimally reasonable to the web3 ecosystem that Optimism wants to target.  This can be corroborated in our updates in our communication thread. What types of grant applications would you like to see (or what RFPs would you create?): We would like to see innovative proposals in the DeFi ecosystem, with value proposals that really contribute to the ecosystem and that generate palpable growth of users with a focus on user experience and product, without only short-term incentives and avoiding the possibility of being gameable. In addition, we would like to see shorter deadlines where the requested funds are applied and evaluate results (its effectiveness) in a short period of time. Innovation in identity, privacy protocols and not so financial applications would also be highly valued. Finally, we want the initiatives in education to focus on the state of development of Optimism as defined by the Foundation according to its own progress (what and when to focus on infra and dApp development; and user education on key use cases).

If so, please specify which: We did not. Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: Penn Blockchain (FranklinDAO) is an active delegate in various defi protocols such as Aave, MakerDAO, dYdX, Uniswap, Centrifuge, etc. Our team ranges from crypto founders to lawyers and developers, many of which have massive passions for the L2 narrative and have been increasingly \u201coptimistic on Optimism.\u201d Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: Team members have been in similar grant reviewing positions in the past. We have worked for Near Protocol, Uniswap Foundation, and other web3 related grant teams. We have also received a few governance related grants ourselves and are very familiar with good and bad processes for the grant application process. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: At its core now, it\u2019s very innovative projects that will bring more users and TVL to Optimism. This could be anywhere from an optimized fork to a new defi primitive. A good request will have multiple milestones, a plan of action (roadmap), concrete deliverables, ambitious goals, and a good developer team to support and build it. No grant request will be perfect, but we\u2019ll try our best to make it as good as possible for Optimism. With years of experience, we\u2019ve gotten good at weeding out the \u201cgrant hunters\u201d from those with genuine intentions. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? This should incorporate your view on what the Optimism ecosystem needs to prioritize right now: As mentioned prior, we\u2019re looking for new defi primitives or optimized forks.

If you are a delegate, please indicate your voting participation rate in OP governance to date: The original SNXAmbassador wallet faced multisig issues from the start, and the new OPSNXAmbassador wallet was created after a few rounds of voting. In my opinion, it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to judge participation based on this. Please link to your voting history and any voting rationale you\u2019ve shared: OPSNXAmbassador Snapshot + SNXAmbassador Snapshot + Voting Rational for Shadow Committee Please outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: Discussed later on. Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: Although I do not have direct technical experience, I rely on the expertise of some members of the SNXAmbassadors who have solidity and other development experience. I also enjoy explaining technical matters. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: Shadow Committee Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role:  I am currently a Core Contributor for Synthetix, where I primarily focus on Communications, Marketing, and Partnerships. I have had the opportunity to take on various projects and initiatives, such as supporting SNX\u2019s international presence (SNX Country Leads) and community marketing (SNX 300), and helping new protocols build on top of Synthetix as part of partnership efforts. I was also recently re-elected as one of the five SNX Ambassadors. The SNX Ambassadors are an elected council that represents Synthetix through governance across the ecosystem and works on partnerships/business development alongside CCs and other councils. I have collaborated with many protocols across Optimism to support their growth, a prime example being Synthetix Spartan Spaces on Twitter, which I host as an SNX Ambassador. This platform promotes great protocols across both Optimism and ETH mainnet and helps them explain their protocols to users. These efforts have led to many successful partnerships and integrations for Synthetix and other ecosystem partners. I have the ability to concisely communicate complex technical topics in a way that is easily understood by end users. Extensive knowledge of the DeFi landscape and what it takes to support a protocol in various aspects. I have been a DeFi user since the early days of the space. Before the days of complex gov tokens and during the great times of yearn and curve being used together being the most interesting use-case  Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: I have a pulse on the Optimism ecosystem and have worked extensively with protocols onboarding to Optimism, helping them navigate the process of growth on Optimism. I have firsthand experience of onboarding new users into the ecosystem and supporting them with a great product and ongoing incentives to keep them engaged in the long term. Based on this experience, I believe I am a strong candidate to serve on the Optimism Growth Experiments Committee, with the goal of driving growth for Optimism in the long term. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant:  Great product / usecase for the protocol within Optimism and the greater DeFi ecosystem A clear path to non-incentivized growth - Overtime Markets fit this with it\u2019s Gov Fund Grant Clear KPI\u2019s Milestones to release grants Quality team (on all facets - devs, community, marketing, etc) Healthy Treasury Potential contingency plan / alternate path to distributing governance fund grant Path to protocol decentralization / Governance structure  Yet again, I will echo what Juan said \u2013 there\u2019s no way that a grant proposal will be perfect or fit in perfectly with what\u2019s required/wanted on Optimism. But there should always be a great attempt to bring in protocols that fit within the needs of Optimism users, and also help bring protocols to a yes grant request if it\u2019s close! What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? There\u2019s three big types of grant applications I would like to see  Innovative protocols that fit well into Optimism - While this is a wide net, I think the simplicity of it can\u2019t be denied. There must be an all-out push for protocols to build innovative protocols both on Optimism, and on Optimism protocols. There is a great opportunity to incentivize money legos to be built and supported for the long term, which will help to incentivize continued growth from users and development across Optimism. Furthermore, these protocols should be incentivized to support builders and education to bring users onto Optimism. Protocol ecosystems are great for Optimism, and should be uniquely supported. Onboarding and Education - The next group of DeFi users should be brought to Optimism directly from CEXs and educated on why it\u2019s important to continue building on top of Ethereum through L2s, and how all their DeFi/crypto needs can be supported on Optimism. These educational needs can be fulfilled through working with YouTubers/guide writers to ensure that there is ample content across onboarding to Optimism and using some of the projects on Optimism. Again, there is a need for a long-term partnership between the Optimism Foundation, Optimism Governance, and protocols on Optimism to ensure that onboarding is as easy as possible. Research Content (with distribution ability) - Research-level content should be incentivized in various ways, though this will require a deep partnership with the Optimism foundation to ensure that it is done correctly.  Yet again, I will echo what Juan said \u2013 there\u2019s no way that a grant proposal will be perfect or fit in perfectly with what\u2019s required/wanted on Optimism. But there should always be a great attempt to bring in protocols that fit within the needs of Optimism users, and also help bring protocols to a yes.

Leading most comprehensive retrospective of OP grants to date, which has already surfaced major insights and revelations of protocols\u2019 handling of OP Was voice influencing major changes in direction of grants, including the implementation of the Grants Council itself  Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: I\u2019m technical right up to the point of the actual software engineering of protocols. Conversant in code and design. Deeply involved in quantitative protocol construction and am credibly \u2018technical\u2019 in defi. Regularly code to extract insights and perform actions onchain. Without going into specifics, my professional background is quantitative in nature. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: I was on the shadow committee, which was an unofficial committee that I believe made valuable contributions. Please demonstrate expertise relevant to this role and your Council sub-committee: I am a builder and have gone through the process of going from zero to a major ecosystem player, building something while facing a threadbare budget, maximum skepticism, and vocal detractors. My team has gotten an OP Labs Grant and an OP governance grant and I believe raised the bar on applying for and reporting on grants of this nature. As a delegate, I\u2019ve voted on grants, and as a member of the Shadow Committee, I\u2019ve helped to push people\u2019s thinking on what grants ought to be used for. As an individual, I\u2019ve proposed ecosystem-wide initiatives rethinking how Optimism manages its resources, and I\u2019ve staked much of my career in crypto on making Optimism succeed. In short, I\u2019ve experienced virtually all tasks and perspectives that could go into the construction of grants, and there\u2019s little in the way of subject matter that I haven\u2019t personally worked with, from crosschain messaging to staking to security to NFTs. I chose to apply for builder grants instead of growth experiments for three reasons.  I already have a track record of independent voting and have advised my delegators that I would always vote and argue against Velodrome\u2019s immediate interest if it was in conflict with what I thought was best for Optimism. That said, it seems that perceived conflicts of interests are less pronounced in this group; more growth experiments are likely to touch velodrome than builder grants. This vertical also plays well into my day job, which has me doing a lot of outreach to builders. In this capacity, hopefully it\u2019s not a stretch to say I\u2019ve likely spoken with more active and prospective builders on Optimism than anyone outside of the OP Foundation. In this way I can help guide builders to the program and get the initiatives we\u2019re looking for. I think builder grants at this stage are more critical for the long-term viability of the Optimism project; there\u2019s a lot of exciting stuff that OP is going to roll out that the builder community needs to be prepared to exploit.  Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: I believe in a structured approach, where the council articulates where OP is and where it wants it to go. It should outline what sorts of people, teams, and activities are needed to get to this desired future, and it should shape and approve grants that get Optimism those people, teams, and activities. Grants should be designed with justifiable, measurable, and achievable objectives, and they should be reviewable periodically so that the Grants Council can guide them and retain the ability to withhold future grants. They should be scaled appropriately to the objectives (and the objectives\u2019 value to the ecosystem), not to the projects\u2019 size or perceived importance. Although there is room to take a slight shotgun approach, grants should go to the projects that are most promising in their domains. This requires the Grants Council to have an informed opinion about the likely winning teams in each space. Just like the best tools are multifunction tools, the best grants will have second-order benefits affecting the largest number of builders. That is, you fund the project that makes other projects more achievable. This is how you accelerate ecosystems. In the course of a grants program, major things might change. This is crypto. So the grants council should also allow for some opportunism in approving grants. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? Although I keep hearing about Optimism needing things like its own GMX, I think we want to skate to where the puck is going, and I think that\u2019s OP Stack and other forms of infrastructural/middleware advancements that publicly increase design space for enterprising builders. We want these fundamental advancements early, which will then through lower costs, better performance, more decentralization, etc, facilitate the building of those apps we want to see. We do want those apps too, things like RWA, gaming, privacy, and so on, but in my mind this all flows downstream of builders knowing that Optimism and not some other ecosystem is inevitable. That is, we want to fund the things that let builders know that we can offer the best ecosystem to work in, the best tools to work with, and the best funding to derisk experimentation. Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: If I am elected, I will review grants that could have a material impact on Velodrome. This is not new; the majority of grants proposed to date have involved Velodrome. That\u2019s unavoidable. We\u2019re an exchange. However, I\u2019ve consistently voted in Optimism\u2019s interest, even when doing so would be against Velodrome\u2019s immediate interests. I do so because I want Optimism to win, and in any case I see Optimism\u2019s success as more necessary for Velodrome\u2019s success than any individual grant.

A Good Governance Fund grant is one that is precise yet flexible. Not everything goes as planned, economic conditions change, users find other interests, liabilities are exposed. However, the projections and expectations of the funding should be clear to help best assess the effectiveness of funding. When we see consistent discussion and passion behind the protocol, it helps us gain confidence in what is being built and how close the goals of the funding can be met through challenges. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? This should incorporate your view on what the Optimism ecosystem needs to prioritize right now We would like to see grant applications that aim to further build the DeFi ecosystem. As crypto users have experienced CEX liability, asset management protocols is a place we\u2019d be excited to explore further, incurring less fees via Optimism\u2019s Optimistic Rollup and attracting users who don\u2019t want to focus on active management. We\u2019d also like to see further investment in informational reporting and developing relations within the Optimism Network. There should be a push to not only follow our current grants, but also to work on reporting it beyond the network, attracting new users based on our presented growth. Expanding the community via informative reports and celebrating the success of the grant funding outside the current Optimism Collective.

This base of research has given me a wealth of knowledge of the different incentives being used across the Ethereum ecosystem. When evaluating grants, this knowledge allows me to detect grant requests that are made to As a product manager focused on growth, I learned to think systematically about the process of transforming a potential user into a super-user. The combination of my technical background with my background in user incentives & behaviour is what will make me a valuable contributor to growth experiments sub-committee. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: Guiding Principle: Grants should use funds efficiently to drive us closer to the Optimistic Vision.  Specific things I\u2019d like to see with grant proposals: Clear milestones with milestone unlocks. Definition of what \u201csuccess\u201d of grant use would be, with trackable metrics. Accomplishes something that would be difficult to accomplish without the grant (bootstrapping liquidity, competitions, meetups, education) Solid logic for why grant is needed and how it will to more sticky users making Optimism their L2 home.  What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? Guiding principle: Bias towards experimentation Given the data we\u2019ve received on past grants, we know that funding massive liquidity incentive programs doesn\u2019t always yield the best results. As it stands right now, we don\u2019t currently know which type of grants are best for Optimism\u2019s growth. Because of this, our bias should be towards trying out new types of grant proposals and then being rigorous on judging how successful they were. As far as specific grant types, I\u2019ve already created a detailed thread here on why I believe competitions would be a great use of the grant funds. Some specific examples of grants that I\u2019d like to see:  Education competitions to improve usability (tutorials, how L2s work, about Optimism) Social media competitions to increase awareness Sponsoring real-world events (optimism/crypto meetups)  It\u2019s important to note that the size of these experimental grants will likely be much smaller than previous grants. As far as the traditional liquidity incentive grants that we saw so much of last year, I am still open to funding them given that they have strong logic behind why this grant will be effective vs some of the grants we saw last season.

I\u2019d encourage anyone interested in my rationale to browse my forum activity here. Please outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: I\u2019m largely responsible for getting BeethovenX & Balancer on Optimism early last summer. Optimism was the first network where boosted pools made up the majority of platform TVL (boosted pools deposit most tokens someone to earn extra yield for LP\u2019s, e.g. Aave). Beyond this, I\u2019ve been a fairly active delegate and participant in the Shadow Committee last season. Overall I believe Optimism has a very promising future and even if not elected to a position here, I\u2019ll continue working behind the scenes as much as I can. Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: I have taken some coding courses several years ago. I\u2019m certainly not a developer now days but I have a strong understanding of technical concepts. I would not be someone who could do a code review or similar. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: The Shadow Committee! Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: I\u2019ve served in the Balancer DAO since its inception. I spent a few months on Balancer\u2019s Grants team. I am a prominent participant in Balancer\u2019s governance process (and actually designed most of it). Additionally, I lead a team called the Balancer Maxis which works for the Balancer DAO in various capacities including on-chain ops and business development. Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: I believe I have a very strong understanding of how incentive mechanisms work in DeFi (and in general). The year is 2023 so we should ensure Optimism does not spend funds on sub-optimal incentive schemes. I\u2019m very open to novel approaches if any are brought forward. At the same time, there are many proposals Optimism has funded which will lead to zero lasting benefit. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: The most important factor is a reasonable likelihood of a long term benefit to Optimism. Printing OP can make anything look good while the printer is on. The critical question is does any benefit persist after the printing ends? If not, do not print. A simple philosophy but I believe a very important one. The act of spending OP on things that will not generate long term value can in fact make it harder for real value to rise to the surface, since it must compete with artificial short term incentives. The more we can level the playing field and let those products/projects which can stand on their own without incentives rise to the surface the quicker Optimism can grow in my view. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? Optimism needs additional second and third level projects which can build on top of the base level primitives like DEX\u2019s and lending markets (where we have sufficient liquidity already). In other words, more and better use cases for why users should come to Optimism and take advantage of our strong DEX & lending market liquidity. Leveraged vaults is one recent example of Notional Finance making good use of Balancer liquidity. Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: I contribute to Balancer DAO and have a good relationship with the BeethovenX team. I would abstain from voting on grant proposals from direct competitors (other DEXes).

From now on we\u2019ll be summarizing our participation in the delegate communication thread as well as on our social media (to spread the word about Optimism Governance outside of this forum). Please outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: L2BEAT is by definition ingrained in the L2 ecosystem. We\u2019ve been early fans and supporters of Optimism. On our website we present detailed information about Optimism (Optimism \u2013 L2BEAT) including project milestones, live TVL and activity tracking. We have created the risk framework for both L2s and Bridges so that first of all we keep the users informed about the risks they\u2019re taking but also we push the protocols (including Optimism) to strive for a better, decentralized, permissionless and trustless future. We are running an Optimism node in a validator mode and we\u2019re actively monitoring if everything is running correctly. Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: Yes, I am fluent with code and software architecture. I used to be a developer and sysadmin a long time ago. I also have a UX and product management background. For the last 15 years I\u2019ve been working as a product manager/product owner. I am used to scheduling and planning IT projects and working with the development teams. I\u2019ve been responsible for project delivery in various projects ranging from ecommerce through financial services to AI systems. As L2BEAT we have a very experienced technical team with deep expertise in L2s and crypto development. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: Yes, the Tooling Committee ([DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee) Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: I have a decent experience with non-crypto granting programs (mainly EU and government funds), both from the perspective of grant receiver as well as grant operator, I believe this might be useful in this role. No matter if I get elected or not, I\u2019ll be sharing my input on how to facilitate proper grant distribution. As L2BEAT we have a good overview of existing tooling in the L2 ecosystem and we have some vision of what\u2019s lacking and what would be interesting to have. We will be sharing those views as RFPs and will engage in discussions to help the relevant teams deliver best results possible. Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: I have lots of experience in working with teams to properly plan and schedule projects. While reviewing the proposals I will be working closely with proposers to make sure their proposals are both realistic and focused on delivering the most value to the Optimism ecosystem. I\u2019ve been already working on the Tooling Committee in the previous season and been engaging in productive discussions with the proposers, hope to continue this in the upcoming season. I believe that the grant council should be more involved in the discussion with projects while fine-tuning the grant proposal so that the proposals are either abandoned early or are written properly so that they are more likely to pass. Especially that going forward we won\u2019t have an open voting but just a Grant Council approval, it is crucial to have a healthy and open discussion on what are the Council\u2019s expectations and goals. Members of L2BEAT team have been involved in the development of many web3 tools, including DethCode (GitHub - dethcrypto/dethcode: View source of deployed Ethereum contracts in VSCode), TypeChain (GitHub - dethcrypto/TypeChain: \ud83d\udd0c TypeScript bindings for Ethereum smart contracts), ethTx (https://ethtx.info/)., TokenFlow (https://tokenflow.live/) and others. I believe that we have necessary experience and knowledge to make a valuable addition to the Builders Sub-committee. Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: A good grant is one that is deliverable in the proposed schedule and budget. I prefer smaller budgets and timeframes with a specific plan for execution. It\u2019s easier to pivot and adapt on a smaller scope than on the very ambitious, multi-month project. It is essential that all proposals include clearly defined and quantifiable key performance indicators (KPIs). This will enable the evaluation of the project\u2019s impact in the future and provide future grantees with valuable insights and lessons learned from the execution of previous projects. When it comes to software, we are firmly committed to the use of open-source, decentralized, and permissionless systems that prioritize the security and privacy of the users. While we acknowledge that certain compromises may be necessary in certain cases (such as with most Layer 2 solutions today), we will always give preference to proposals that align more closely with these values when presented with multiple options. What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? Regarding the type of proposals that we are looking for, we feel that there is a lot of space to innovate in terms of:  User-facing apps with exceptional user experience (like wallets, but also specific smaller feature-apps) Governance tooling, especially all kinds of projects that facilitate control and transparency over distributed funds or that allow for better process management in terms of Optimism governance Advanced developer tooling (like more sophisticated block explorers, etc.) that enhance developer experience and makes it easier to build, test and deploy software on Optimism Tools and resources that facilitate maintenance of Optimism rollup, like tooling that helps run an in-house Optimism validator node and monitor for the issues, in the future the possibility to submit fraud proofs All kinds of educational resources to promote not only the mechanics but also values of the Optimism ecosystem  Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: I don\u2019t think there are any existing personal conflicts of interest. If there are any during my tenure, I will immediately reveal them. As L2BEAT, we are running a research and analytics platform for the L2 ecosystem (https://l2beat.com/) so obviously any competing project could be considered as posing a conflict of interest. However, in all cases I will work closely with the projects for their best interest and best interest of the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems. Furthermore, as L2BEAT we might be applying for Optimism grants as well - in such cases I will abstain from voting and will not engage in the Council discussions on this specific proposal.

Please outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: I don\u2019t have a project of my own on Optimism so my contribution could be seen as limited to some audience. Nonetheless, as I am quite active on OP Governance, here are few small one\u2019s I would like to mention.  I was actively sharing my feedback on proposals during initial stage of our gov, when we were going through Phase 0. Lead DeFi Committee C Member of NFT committee After finding that Uni is seeking community feedback on their OP grant distribution, I shared my thought and they considered it. ([RFC] The Optimism-Uniswap Protocol Liquidity Mining Program - #9 by devinwalsh - Proposal Discussion - Uniswap Governance) I met Barbarossa (from Arrakis) and invited them to join our gov, they later submitted a grant proposal. Helped Tally in drafting their proposal ( Abstained from voting) Contributed to OP manual - Pull request. Update manual.md by OPuserWasTaken \u00b7 Pull Request #13 \u00b7 ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual \u00b7 GitHub  Created a flow chart for season 2 and later a zk-based badge (on Sisimo) for season 2 committee members Contributed to almost all proposals on this forum, in one way or another. Along with DeFiLatam Team, contributed towards updating OP manual.  Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: As a pseudo anon this is little weird but here are few points. As tradi-fi dev moving towards biz-dev and product management, I have seen and lead couple of end-to-end product development, so I understand bits and pieces of a project development, their complexity and challenges. No solidity experience but I am following and reading about web3 space from past couple of year, both personally and professionally, so I am comfortable with most web3 ecosystem. Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: DeFi Committee C NFT committee Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: Professionally, I have been on both side of grant, receiving and granting, with only difference is that web3 space is moving at an insane speed compare to tradifi. Deep understanding on Optimism ecosystem. Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee:  Learned a lot about distributed communication/co-ordination from my participation in season 2 committee. After reading all most all proposals on this forum, I am quite comfortable with reviewing a proposal based on its merit. As I am part of this gov from beginning, I have the full context on what type of funding was approved, their impact, drawback and scope of improvement. This is quite important as I can apply those learning on upcoming proposals. Not related to any project so my views not biased towards anyone.  Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: It wont be perfect, we just completed two seasons with some good and bad use of grant but we can apply those learning to build something new and better.  Clear timeline, short duration and KPI based proposals. From reviewer side, willingness to work in tandem with protocol. Foundation is working on iteration and i would like to see the same approach applied when doing the fund allocation, distribution of fund in small amount to fund and support as many proposals as possible.  What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? This should incorporate your view on what the Optimism ecosystem needs to prioritize right now.  Measurable, focus on short duration. Do, learn, and iterate Privacy related project. (DeFi or P2P) Building on/around LSD Project working on Digital Identity. Tool and infra on Optimism. With low transaction cost and OP stack, i believe on chain gaming will see some traction, metaverse is another domain that i am really excited about and would love to see some innovation around it.  Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: None, I am not related to any project in any way. Happy to answer any query.
