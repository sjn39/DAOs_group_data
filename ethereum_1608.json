                    "content": "This is a discussion topic for EIP-1240 The difficulty bomb operates under the assumption that miners decide what code economic participants are running, rather than economic participants deciding for themselves.  In reality, miners will mine whatever chain is most profitable and the most profitable chain is the one that economic participants use.  If 99% of miners mine a chain that no economic participants use then that chain will have no value and the miners will cease mining of it in favor of some other chain that does have economic participants.  Another way to put this is that miners will follow economic participants, not the other way around. With the difficulty bomb removed, when Casper is released it will be up to economic participants to decide whether they want the features that Casper enables or not.  If they do not want Casper, they are free to continue running unpatched clients and participating in the Ethereum network as it exists today.  This freedom of choice is the cornerstone of DLTs and making it hard for people to make that choice (by creating an artificial pressure) does not work towards that goal of freedom of choice.  If the development team is not confident that economic participants will want Casper, then they should re-evaluate their priorities rather than trying to force Casper onto users. Personal Note: I think we will see almost all economic participants in Ethereum switch to PoS/Sharding without any extra pressure beyond client defaults. ",

                    "content": "Reading over the All Core Devs meeting notes, it appears as though there is a belief among the developers that economic participants will not want to move to Shasper when the time comes.  I would like to see more discussion on the reasoning for this belief.  If the reasoning for this belief is sound, then we should ask ourselves, \u201cWhy are we building features that users do not want?\u201d I am of the opinion that hard forks should include substantial enough changes that users pro-actively want to upgrade.  To use an analogy, users shouldn\u2019t be forced to upgrade to an iPhone 35Q because their previous iPhone battery was designed to intentionally degrade with time and no one makes/sells old models anymore, they should upgrade to iPhone 35Q because it has compelling new features that the user wants and upgrading is an attractive proposition. At the moment, the ice age concept is planned obsolescence, and it forces users into a situation where the software they were using becomes unusable after a certain time in order to try to force users to use new software.  I am of the opinion that this is a distasteful business practice. As a consumer, I have been bitten many times by planned obsolescence and now it is a business strategy that I actively try to avoid. As a developer, planned obsolescence is a business practice that makes me feel like the work I am doing is not valued by users if they have to be \u201cforced\u201d to use it (decreases developer happiness). As a business owner, planned obsolescence is a reasonable business strategy and can work in some situations. I would like to hear arguments from those in favor of planned obsolescence as to why they believe that Ethereum has a large enough of a moat to practice such strategies (they tend to not work as well when users have choice), and what the revenue benefits are to the business.
