I think what is the most important thing to say is congratulations to the developers for making Maker a far more robust protocol than it was this time a year ago. This was a much bigger stress test than Black Thursday and this time, the protocol performed amazingly!! That said, I\u2019m gonna add a short list of things that didn\u2019t go quite perfectly last night. Hopefully, these are things we can discuss and improve before the next seismic crash - whenever that may be. We talked about some of this on the chat but I think it would be nice to put it one place for different teams to look through.   The OSM feed did not update at 13:00 UTC on 19/05 as it usually does due to insufficient gas. Gas prices were insane at this point, around 2500 gwei. As a result, the liquidation prices remained several hundred dollars above the true price, even though the crash persisted for well over an hour. I believe we had ETH at $2440 when it was actually under $2000 for an extended period of time. We were lucky that ETH bounced back from there but had it crashed further, this price feed delay might have caused bad debt issues.   Two vaults were liquidated and we could not recover their debt fully. This was simply liquidations being stretched to the limit presumably. Several vaults were liquidated and no collateral was returned - again a sign that this stress test pushed our systems pretty hard. Would we have survived had ETH crashed down to, say, $1400? This may also be related to the oracle issues in 1 - perhaps we were just too slow to update the prices and hence fell behind on the liquidation process.   ZRX had really low liquidity which meant that the auctions took a long time to clear. Moreover, some vaults which were underwater could not be liquidated because there simply wasn\u2019t enough ZRX liquidity anywhere. I\u2019m not sure if the same situation affected any other tokens but it was an interesting situation that played out.   The PSM generally helped keep DAI pegged. However, I\u2019m not sure if USDC itself was on peg - sources like Coingecko indicate that it was not. USDT certainly did not stay pegged. Perhaps it\u2019s worth thinking about how the PSM should function when our oracles suggest that USDC is off peg?   These were my four observations from yesterday. And again, congrats to all, especially the Liq 2.0 guys for massively improving the protocol and making it ready for Wild Wednesday. ",

I\u2019m not sure if the same situation affected any other tokens but it was an interesting situation that played out.   Let me also take a moment to point out that the liquidations in ZRX (and it looks like that big vault is eligible to be kicked again even now) are what has made that vault class profitable. I estimate it has only produced ~30k DAI in fees over the 11 months this class has been active. My understanding is that this does not begin to cover the oracle costs for this token. Given that most of the debt has been cleared out of this vault class, this is a good opportunity to retire the ZRX vault class. However we choose to encourage vault closure in this vault class can also serve as a template for offloading other vault classes that lose money by not even covering oracle costs. ",

The clear consideration here being the USDC-A vault which currently has no stability fee but is our 4th biggest vault type. I\u2019d also be interested in the costs the PSM incurs. We have allowed nearly a billion DAI to be generated and recouped less than a million in fees - are we subsiding stability here? ",

                    "content": "I want to echo this. While some of the delay was dealing with auditor schedules post DeFi summer, much of this delay was related to how we set priorities.  We were working on collateral onboarding, to keep up with DeFi summer DAI demand, PSMs, RWAs, flash loan fixes for governance, staffing problems, etc.  Some of this was just us responding to the market conditions or fire fighting, but everything else should not have been as high a priority.  Even the weekly spell cadence is aggressive and impacts our schedules. The fix is about communication of risks, rewards, and timelines and then a decisive follow-up on priorities.  We got very lucky.  A slip of 2 weeks more on the schedule would have been disastrous for the protocol this past week. This is my takeaway.  It was clear internally where the risk was, but we could have done better about pushing back on collateral onboarding to make sure the risk was better mitigated.  20/20 hindsight would have indicated we should have done the PSM immediately.  This would have taken the dire need for DAI supply off the table, and allowed us to focus earlier on completion of LIQ-2.0.  After that, like now, we can go back to being more focused on MIPs and collateral onboarding.  Risks and firefighting are always the high priority interrupt.  Maker should better have classified LIQ-2.0 as a high priority emergency. This should be a blameless exercise, but I think it\u2019s a good idea for each domain to ask how they could have enabled LIQ-2.0 better.  It may be that it was not communicated clearly enough how important this upgrade was for teams to make that choice, but look beyond that at what you can control.  What changes would you make today? In the end, we did know this was a priority, and we push aggressively in a few areas to ensure the schedule didn\u2019t slip more than it needed to.  That is a success, and teams should take a well deserved victory lap. ",

The Liquidation 2.0 timeline has definitely been long as hell, and more than anything that has appeared to be due to the long wait for audits. That said, both @Risk-Core-Unit and @Protocol-Engineering have been pushing really hard since then to get it out. They\u2019ve been pushing so hard because they knew that we needed to beat the next major crash. Everyone knew it was coming sooner or later. Everyone involved was aware of the urgency as the market continued to rise. Everyone pushed themselves hard to make sure it didn\u2019t slip more than absolutely necessary. We made our own luck here. And the outcome was that we did beat the crash on the major vault types. Not only that, but we also managed to onboard the PSM to prevent the peg from deviating significantly during the supply-demand imbalance. We also managed to onboard the first RWA\u2019s and AMM LPTs, both of which should help to provide DAI supply when the bear-market hits in earnest. Looking at what we needed to do, and what we\u2019ve done, I think everyone involved has done a damn good job at prioritizing. We\u2019ve staved off multiple existential threats to the protocol, and have probably laid the groundwork in time for us to stave off the next one (prolonged bear market.) We also (imo correctly) deprioritized several technical improvements that do not represent existential threats. There are always ways in which we can improve, and I think everyone will be more comfortable if we have more breathing room in the future, but we should not dismiss that which we did well as luck. Nor attribute that which went badly only to failures of process or prioritization. ",

This OSM action was delayed by about 8 minutes, as it usually  happens around the fifth minute of the hour. At 13:05 UTC, current OSM became $2705 (expected) and the next OSM was queued up at $2627. Between 12:13 and 13:05, ETH price dropped from $2723 to a low of $2003 before recovering to $2257 at the top of the hour. Due to network congestion and high gas cost during that period, the medianizer price couldn\u2019t be updated in time for the OSM update of 13:05, so the price that was queued up was the current price of approximately 12:30 instead of 13:05.     AstronautThis:  The OSM feed did not update at 01:00 UTC on 19/05 as it usually does due to insufficient gas. Gas prices were insane at this point, around 2500 gwei. As a result, the liquidation prices remained several hundred dollars above the true price, even though the crash persisted for well over an hour. I believe we had ETH at $2440 when it was actually under $2000 for an extended period of time. We were lucky that ETH bounced back from there but had it crashed further, this price feed delay might have caused bad debt issues.   ",
