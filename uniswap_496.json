The other half gets pooled with a few new pools together with a matched amount of another token. The initial liquidity supply should be locked so there is alway plenty of liquidity and no rug pull. Pair UNI with the more decent projects and I think uni will quickly gain tracktion as the go to token for liquidity. This put also less tokens in circulation, good for the price. People a getting instant fast small slippage transactions with uni which incrreases exposure and adoption. ",
