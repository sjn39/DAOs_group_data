                    "content": "Hello everyone. I come here to post a reflexion I originally posted as a response in the Maker subreddit, because I think it has its place here. The discussion was about the Governance Security Module vote being removed from the voting page, and the fact that Executive votes are hidden after a week to avoid vote dispersion, to ensure governance security. The system of \u201cgoverning proposals\u201d is designed for sequential voting (one after the other, the votes from proposal A switching to proposal B up to the point where B has more MKR votes than A). This leads me to the two following points: 1- If I\u2019m not mistaken this means that during a vote for a new proposal, the governance security is lowered since the votes are split between the governing proposal and the one being voted in. This might be part of the attack vector that the GSM was supposed to prevent, I don\u2019t remember. The consequence is that voting might augment overall governance risk temporarily, which creates an incentive to stay on the governing proposal and for big holders to stake a lot on it. This leads to the voting system potentially being stuck on a proposal. Since I originally posted this a new vote has been proposed and it is far from overtaking the governing proposal that has been heavily voted after the potential exploit was disclosed. This leads me to believe that my intuition was right. I don\u2019t see an obvious solution to this issue without a deep change in the voting system, maybe the team has already discussed this, I\u2019m curious to know what you think about it. 2- This means that 2 votes can\u2019t happen in parallel, as it would compromise security because of vote dispersion and could be confusing to voters that would have to choose which proposal is the most important to vote for. (or not understanding why they can\u2019t vote for both, I didn\u2019t understand the fact that votes are \u201ctransferred\u201d from one proposal to the other until recently) For this, I think that splitting the voting mechanism between 1. constants setting (DSR, stability fees, debt ceilings) 2. other governance votes (like the Governance security module vote) would improve the issue of concurrency voting. It would be possible for an MKR holder to vote in both voting branches, and the transfer of MKR allocated to proposals would only be inside the same branch. This would not (theoretically) lower security, except if it lowered engagement even more. While it makes sense to have sequential votes and a unique governing proposal for the system constants, It is less clear why other proposals would fit in the same \u201cproposal pipe\u201d. Also the UI could gather both proposal branches in the same page with some kind of color code and differentiate in the text at the top of the page like  Currently voting for  Activate DSR, Dai Stability Fee, and Sai Stability Fee Adjustments  (constants voting) Currently voting for  Governance Security Module Delay  (operations voting)  It seems to me that this would avoid lowering the votes and security while improving governability. I hope this helps somehow or sparks some discussions, I might be totally wrong in my analysis of the system, in that case please let me know. ",

I also don\u2019t think there is a solution other than a deep change to the voting system. That said, I think we will be stuck with continuous approval for some time yet. To your second point: Yes and no. I actually think that the dispersion problem isn\u2019t too severe of an issue (at least for perhaps 3-4 votes.) It\u2019s difficult to judge of course, and it\u2019s true that it reduces security whenever MKR is split, but in practice I don\u2019t think the dispersion will be reliable enough to exploited in practice. I agree the messaging around the \u2018transfer\u2019 of votes could be clearer. The whole system could be clearer to be honest. The split into different branches is an interesting idea and I quite like it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts! ",

Current voting system is more about voting on \u201cState transitions\u201d rather that state itself. I Guess It had been made this way, to be more flexible, but it has it\u2019s problems what we can see here. I think a solution is to build voting as a staking system. First we need define a datastructure that represent valid state of a system. Then there need to be mechanics to register new instance of datastructure with new proposed values by literally anyone. Then any MKR holder should be able to stake it\u2019s MKR tokens on any configuration. If leading (with most MKR\u2019s staken) configuration changes because of this action it becomes new configuration of a system with all consequences. Sure there might be some delay between certain configuration being voted in and it being used, but at this point it is just implementation detail. The core concept is that insead of voting on state transitions there need to be staking on state of a system BTW if You change voting with staking MKR tokens are securing a system in much more obvious way.

To some degree we\u2019ve been stuck in the risk-parameter voting cycle which has sometimes made it difficult to introduce infrastructure-type improvements like the GSM. We undoubtedly need to support both. Perhaps by redefining the voting cycle where risk parameters have the ability to be quickly implemented on a weekly basis (like they are today), become coupled with infrastructure changes made on a monthly basis could help highlight e.g. \u201cah in 4 weeks, we\u2019re voting on this new shiny change, cool\u201d\u2026meaning we could plan for it better.
