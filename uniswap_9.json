I can not figure out how it is possible or how it can grow the ecosystem of Uniswapbecause i don\u2019t have the technical knowledge but if you do please suggest. We all know an artist in our circle of people who may have brilliant ideas to get things even more interesting and help to get this community even bigger. Artists come along and deposit their art then programmers analyze it and do the rest. (I am making a very simple example but you get the idea) actually I saw a thing like this on Harvest but It was already closed so i didn\u2019t understand what was going on. A universal and user friendly system which can be used by any artist without any experience of Defi.    If you are not in a mood to write just click  good idea not related to Uniswap     0 voters     ",
