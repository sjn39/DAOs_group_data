But it is important to know how to ask good questions so support team can effectively help you. In this post, I would walk through how to ask good questions on Gitcoin (discord and knowledge base).  Do your research before asking There is a great post from freeCodeCamp named Read - Search - Ask. So before asking, make sure to do some research by yourself, there are lots of informations and tools you could choose. Here I would like to introduce some tips:  Mee6 bot for FAQ Support knowledge base Search feature on discord Google it  If you have any questions related with Gitcoin product, you should join our Gitcoin Discord Server. Choose a support role in #start-here channel. And then join #general-support channel. In support channel, we have deployed Mee6 bot for the FAQ list.
