We discussed everything MakerDAO, from:  The ELI5 on what exactly is a DLO (DAO-Level Objectives) How DLOs and Work Proposals (WP) will help monitor Ecosystem Actors (EA) and Core Units progress. Why the old way of approving MIP40 budget request for CUs did not work. Why it\u2019s important for  Core Unit team members to participate in the development of the Scope Frameworks. And most importantly, why DLOs will inspire the entrepreneurship hunger that is missing in the community.  We hope you enjoy this episode and gain an inside look at why the Endgame is a game-changer.

                    "content": "This was superb @flipflopflapdelegate @rspa @ultraschuppi! Very important and insightful conversation. A one stop shop for where to spend ONE HOUR to get an overview of what\u2019s going on now organizationally at MakerDAO. (p.s. the YouTube version is not accessible) We agree that the various restructuring initiatives and plans present exciting opportunities for current contributors, but also that the substance of what\u2019s being proposed in all its complexity and intimidating inaccessibility might be just what\u2019s needed to meet the outrageously ambitions ultimate goal we believe is held by all deep down. There is daily evidence that if any group of people can pull it off - this is the crew to do it. ACREinvest has a special fondness for the governance design work @juan @Retro. It\u2019s the overall enabling work that most interests us and why our approach to launching our own decentralized community - ACRE DAOs - actually aligns so well with this next phase for MakerDAO. We are thinking about how to recruit contributors via the social DAO work we have been doing in ReFi and tokenized communities generally. It might look like an ACRE DAOs sponsored CVC (?). The community treasury currently holds a teeny tinsy bit of MKR that is delegated to the ACREinvest Platform. We are trying to get up to speed on how the Pregame will work, and determine whether there\u2019s a clear structure for contributor involvement that we can plug our members into as part of Season 2 launching April 1. On our side, we can juice the opportunity with ACRE token rewards which paired with the compensation for CVCs could be a powerful combination. Among the people we\u2019ve been in community with since launching in December 2021, we think there\u2019s a strong argument that MakerDAO is worth their time if they are trying to solve for doing things like converting conventional farmland to regenerative agriculture and clean energy retrofitting old buildings like the work of Blocpower. The difference here is a focus on permissionless credit at scale and democratizing access to finance. (Appreciate the PECU office hours discussion today @brianmcmichael @cmooney @Kurt_Barry!) Among all the great ReFi projects and efforts ongoing, no one has the scale and incumbent status that MakerDAO does to give these efforts a link to what they desperately all need:  Network Effects Liquidity & market interest Adoption  Thus, the input of those focused on impact and regenerative economics at this formative time at Maker could have such powerful downstream effects for what their particular projects can access in the future. The direction of the Endgame effort gives us a lot to talk about in those circles, especially with the press catching on MakerDAO Constitution Would Fund Sustainability Efforts With 20K MKR Tokens From Reserves, Emissions The article highlights that an interest in the \u201cimpact\u201d side of things is not new. This is really important information to get out:. From the Coindesk article:  Although Christenson published his climate-forward draft Constitution for MakerDAO this week, the concept of sustainability can be traced back to the first-ever public MKR vote in September 2018, a vote on guiding principles. One of the principles was sustainable finance. \u201cThis means that Maker will be biased towards, for example, renewable energy that provides a long-term global benefit, while being biased against funding fossil fuels and other assets that create long-term risk, said a Maker blog post from August 2018 related to the first vote. Moreover, Christensen discussed climate change in \u201cThe Case for Clean Money\u201d in 2021, well before this attempt to codify the principles for the DAO. \u201cBy tapping into the fundamental features of blockchain we can develop verifiable processes to ensure all Maker collateral is in sustainable and climate-aligned assets that consider the long term impacts of financial activity on the environment,\u201d Christensen wrote at the time.  Based on this comment from Rune, we look forward to the natural relationship between the interests of our network in ReFi and Maker being made very obvious.    MIP101: The Maker Constitution   The answer is to deliver on the original clean money vision but simplifying it to funding the awareness of energy solutions that have 1) proven track record of large scale decarbonization 2) produce cheap electricity when all factors are considered, including storage and transmission. It allows us to vastly simplify our RWA process, which is already our most complex issue that tends to generate the most trouble in the community and bureaucracy. Then we are both having a huge impact with a set-and-forget solution, so we can focus all our efforts on making profits to ensure the sustainability of the early endgame with good conscience, and we have also not turned our backs on the original Clean Money vision. Not referencing Clean Money in the constitution was an obvious mistake that I will correct as soon as I have time. It is a part of the history and spirit of the constitution.   ",

                    "content": "Great call guys, thank you! Couple of things that came to mind during the call:  At the 15min mark there is discussion about DLOs identifying objectives and priorities, which may otherwise get lost within the remit of a single CU. I see the intent here, and generally agree with you - so in spirit I\u2019m with you on all this - but wanted to clarify that PECU (as per the example) is pretty strict about not working on things that are not approved by Governance. A number of times we have delayed or waited for explicit approval before commencing work - it makes for slower turn-around but retains a commitment to MKR holders as decision makers. Where there does occur a clash of priorities, it is typically resolved through technical discussion of what makes logical sense, which is then put to the community for approval (e.g. L2 progression with Optimistic rollups first etc). There was discussion of maintenance - indeed this is a critical area that happens in the background and doesn\u2019t get much spotlight because it isn\u2019t a shiny sexy thing and is at risk of falling through the gaps. PE is working on detailing this in more detail - and it will form a key part of the scopes - as you say, possibly on a retainer type basis for such work to be safely captured due to its overlap with spells, new/old modules etc. In terms of participation - Schuppi, good questions there - PE is engaged, and as Juan mentioned, we are working with GovAlpha to document/codify the spells process so there is documentation as part of the Governance Security Scopes. This is not only limited to Governance Security, but will also need to cover our L2/core work as well as innovative SubDAO modules that touch the core. The reason why this hasn\u2019t been all too visible for the community is - in my view - due to the ongoing and changing nature of the Endgame proposal, so there is an element of change that we are wrapping our heads around while keeping things moving on a development and spells front    All in all, great call, I\u2019d like to encourage Delegates to reach out to PE if you have  any questions wrt how Engineering related tasks fit with Endgame - we may not have the explicit details just yet but it is something we are actively working through.
