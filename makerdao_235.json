If not, what happens when the stability of Dai is hypothetically in conflict with the unifying vision?   Personally, I don\u2019t think that it the term unifying vision implies an answer to this one way or another. Voting on a unifying vision doesn\u2019t require us to abandon stability for the vision, nor abandon the vision for stability. I think trying to answer what this means in hypothetical situations isn\u2019t a good use of time. If we\u2019re faced with that choice, we\u2019ll need to make it at that time depending on the circumstances. I don\u2019t think there is a way of clarifying all these terms such that there is no ambiguity at all. I would encourage you to vote based on your own interpretation rather than waiting for people to agree on how they apply in hypothetical situations. The point of these polls is to better understand community sentiment, not to commit MakerDAO to any course of action. ",

(\u2018Separation of Powers\u2019 and \u2018Decision Impact Assessment\u2019) Regarding \u2018stable equilibrium\u2019 I disagreed because we are still in growth phase so I still expect major changes will be needed in certain things. Regarding MKR holders first.    As per my own delegate statement I believe all stakeholders should be considered equally.   It is almost a given with MKR being able to vote that they will consider themselves first in virtually every case.   Example turning down MKR rewards for governance participation. Decentralization is not the end all be all and in fact with respect governance is extremely centralized not just in Maker but almost every other significant protocol I can think of. I am also probably more on the side of prioritizing growth over MKR issuance because I can still be very conservative on MKR issuance, but still want some issuance for good reasons.   MKR rewards for governance participation for example.    Also I am probably the most conservative regarding MKR rewards for contractors, in that I want these to be conditional on the protocol having net DAI earnings.   In fact I want to change the way the system manages profits so the system is taking some % of DAI profits for a period and is buying MKR to vest for MKR compensation - excess potentially going to a MKR vesting buffer, with some percentage of this going to burn\u2026   This involves a change in how either governance deals with SB as well as what flaps do with MKR once purchased.   I believe this system can be slightly modified to do much better.  End result in my own model we only mint MKR to sell when the system has a expenditure shortfall (i.e. contractor commitments) beyond excess reserves. Regarding Eth as \u2018core\u2019 decentralized coin.   I think we can do better with other reasonably high MC coins by adopting a slightly different growth approach - to be released by me soon hopefully. ETH will always be a core collateral given the high MC. Most everything else is a \u2018somewhat agree\u2019 because details need to be discussed.   Sagittarius Engine as presented imo needs significant rework but much of what @rune has proposed can be accommodated.   Many of the ideas in there are good but the details really need a lot of consideration since as I see it - the engine is not sustainable - nor is it likely to be fair (first come first serve to borrowing seems wrong and emptying the SB to slot for MKR to borrow DAI seems highly risky - there are much better alternatives to achieve the same goals). 20211028_1503U EDIT ADD:   On-chain I voted yes to this because I believe the DAO can move forward on this as a vision statement and work on the details that need real work.  SE honestly needs significant rework.  I think it is more important to take a stance on \u2018sustainability\u2019 and then work out the details of achieving it than to say no because the vision doesn\u2019t contain a well formulated sustainable model.  Sometimes you have to support intent not just with your words, but also actions. ",

Dai holders don\u2019t have direct control over the protocol, which is why MKR holders is the best stand in for their interests. So MKR holders first is meant in comparison to delegates, mandated actors, collateral providers etc, in terms of who should the overall governance infrastructure be designed to serve. If MKR holders are happy, everyone else will also be best off. Dai users and Dai stability is the number one priority, in a way that is so fundamental that e.g. the entire Clean Money vision can only be justified if it entirely serves the goal of stability. But it does: Dai simply isn\u2019t gonna make it if the world continues on its current path towards collapse. If you want to stabilize a currency you need to stabilize the economy. If you want to stabilize the economy, you need to stabilize the environment. In this sense, the USD is not a stable currency - its own popularity is actively contributing to its demise as it directly funds activity that erodes the environmental foundation of its local economy.

We believe this can spark a more vibrant ecosystem that will ultimately establish Maker as a financial force with a positive societal impact. This is a net value add for the entire web3 community.

                    "content": "This proposal bundles many somewhat related and unrelated strategic ideas. I think it will take the community some time to unpack and debate all of them. I will comment on a few of them here: Two points that I wanted to comment on specifically are whether \u201cMakerDAO should prioritise real world asset collateral in climate-change resilient jurisdictions\u201d, as well as the comments on USD hyperinflation and a future free-floating DAI from the original Clean Money post. I think these particular strategic themes should be split out from the general \u201cGreen Money\u201d vision since they don\u2019t necessarily align with a lot of people\u2019s views on how to address the Climate Emergency and also have serious implications for all users of the system through monetary policy, and so should be debated separately from the proposal that \u201cClean Money and fighting climate change should be MakerDAO\u2019s unifying vision\u201d. Firstly, the idea of strongly prioritising \u201cclimate-change resilient jurisdictions\u201d/\u201cSuper Countries\u201d to the exclusion of regions that are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change sounds like a cynical and defeatist Sacrifice Zone mentality that short-sells the roles of human compassion and international cooperation in addressing the crisis, while also failing to address the crisis itself, positioning us to \u201crush to the lifeboats\u201d instead of taking responsibility for stewarding our environments. Needless to say, relocating the entire human civilisation to New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK is not a viable strategy, and even if it somehow were I don\u2019t think most people would recognise that as a \u201csolution\u201d to the crisis at all. Instead, I think most people who share our enthusiasm for actively addressing Climate Change believe that capital allocation to regions that are most affected by climate change is also required both in order to effect quicker decarbonisation as well as to mitigate the existing and oncoming effects of the crisis. In fact, some of the resilient Super Countries listed already have access to some of the most ample renewables financing available, and might not necessarily be the regions where our financing will be most effective in addressing the crisis. Secondly, I believe that tying in monetary policy considerations with the ESG investment strategy should be done only very carefully or perhaps not at all. In order for DAI monetary policy to remain credible, it\u2019s important to always clearly signal that transient political themes, collateral onboarding prioritisation, etc. will not be allowed to sway the promised monetary policy objectives (stability, liquidity). More concretely, I think while all of the borrowing is effectively USD-denominated, signalling a vague plan to transition to a different peg strategy is very off-putting for borrowers and in particular introduces huge uncertainty around currency risk for long-term RWA borrowers. Moreover, I think the assertion that Climate Change will lead to hyperinflation in USD is quite controversial and should be debated independently of our \u201cGreen Money\u201d/ESG collateral objectives, which are much less contentious, and not potentially destabilising to the global community of DAI users and borrowers.

It is interesting that despite the unpopularity of this one, most people somewhat agreed with MakerDAO should prioritize growth over conservative MKR token issuance. From my perspective, most of the goals that aren\u2019t aligned with growing Maker or \u201cgetting rich\u201d are an inefficient use of resources. However, conservative MKR token issuance keeps everything honest.   If we are not focused on getting rich and also not focused on conservative issuance, we are leveraging inefficiency and will suffer later. To me, putting greater emphasis on generating profit while also keeping the system honest with consersative MKR issuance is a good balance. Another thing, which I believe to be true, is that emphasis on profit making is more important in defi/daos than it is in centralized organizations. If the focus isn\u2019t on maximizing profit people will allocate more capital elsewhere and have lower exposure to the dao and thus lower incentive to vote and participate. DAOs need to never forget about profit making. ",

And I think such a definition if applied fairly excludes a majority of the countries and their citizens that DAI is best poised to assist. When the local USDA rep. analyzes my client\u2019s farm and designates certain acres \u201chighly erodible\u201d, which means the client will have to purchase different expensive equipment and till the ground in a certain limited manner, yet does that voluntarily, that\u2019s climate-change resilient.  What, say, Latin American countries do this? Are we to exclude them from DAI lending?  When my public power company (all electrical power sales in Nebraska must be by publicly owned entities, BTW) successfully sells bonds to generate funds to build wind farms, that\u2019s climate-change resilient.  When farmers create co-ops to build ethanol plants then successfully pressure politicians to require inclusion of ethanol in gasoline, that\u2019s climate-change resilient.  If I want to run even more environmental-friendly E85 in my vehicle, I have at least 10 locations in Omaha to get that.  In Canada E85 is almost non-existent and most of the provinces\u2019 ethanol blending requirements are less than USA. My point: proclamations from a country\u2019s national government and taxing corporations are feel-good measures and are hollow in gauging a country\u2019s true \u201cclimate change resiliency\u201d; it is not a path we should start walking down because if applied fairly it takes a 180 turn from what I thought our goal was - populist and near borderless access to debt financing through cryptocurrency.
