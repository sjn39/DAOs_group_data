                    "content": " Background The purpose of the Project-based Funding Request (PFR) is to gain support from the community as to the use of the existing Collateral Engineering Services (CES) core unit budget for professional services related to collateral onboarding and management. During the collateral onboarding process, the collateral stakeholders and domain teams need access to professional services for the assessment, implementation, and management of collateral applications relating to risk, legal, business terms, credit, and other attributes. Given the current situation with Real World Assets (RWA) and to eliminate any confusion with the SPFs, I am asking the community to support the utilization of the current CES budget for RWA professional services. CES will manage the administration and implementation of the reallocated funds.  Request Purpose of Funding: RWA professional services for collateral applications as listed on the CSI. Funding Approval: 44,000 Dai or 45% of the Professional Services CES budget line item 56,000 Dai or 40% of the Contingency Buffer CES budget line item 100,000 Dai is an allocation only. Professional services for RWAs can have large variances and a buffer prevents delays in the implementation of any one collateral. It also provides a cap so that the community is involved with any additional expenses that go over this amount. If additional funds are requested, CES will share summary data and the community will make a decision on continued professional services funding for RWAs whether from the existing CES budget or as a SPF. Scope of Work:  Fulfill the onboarding and management requirements of RWAs Utilize contractors/third parties to advise the domain teams in the areas of risk, legal, business terms, credit, etc. for the purposes of implementing RWAs Educate the community (Discord, forums, meetings) on the details of the RWA implementations If necessary, engage third parties to provide assessments relating to risk, terms, credit, or other areas deemed necessary by the domain teams Hire contractors to perform professional services on behalf of the CES core unit and domain teams  Fund Management:  All work will be managed by invoices from contracted services Once the work is complete, a full accounting of the costs will be made publicly available   Process   Tuesday, Aug 16: PFR forum post  Friday, Aug 19: Updated: Clarify the use of existing CES budgeted funds for RWA professional services  Monday, Aug 22: Governance Poll to approve the PFR  Thursday, Aug 25: Poll ends, CES budgeted funds supported/not supported  ",

I think the project based approach makes sense for this MIP if this is the only pending workstream (set of tasks) in the project which it might not be. Are there other workstreams that would require additional funding to complete this MIP, would it be better for the CUs and community if there was one PFR that covered the MIP from now until execution? The MIP has been approved so splitting out the additional funding into smaller pieces does not make sense. In either case, happy to see that there is interest from multiple CUs on moving this MIP forward. ",

The big gap with MIP65 is MakerDAO legal support. If there is additional work and we need to engage external third parties for opinions/assessments, the collateral applicant has agreed to pay for those services. The implementation teams may have questions and therefore we may pay for third party advice but that should be covered under this amount. I do not anticipate additional PFRs for MIP65. Regarding the process, for RWAs that are Greenlit, the goal would be to have one PFR per application then allow the community to decide whether to fund it. If not, we stop work and move on. We want to have budget for professional services so we\u2019re not going back to the DAO to do Dai transfers for each RWA. We would still continue with the PFR request/gov poll for each RWA since the professional services investment might not be worth it and this would allow the community to decide based upon the data we provide. It\u2019s important to think of this work as an investment. We also want to ensure that any RWA costs are allocated back to the appropriate parties. It\u2019s common for collateral applicants to pay for a majority of the professional services costs. We also need to evaluate implementation costs for development and ensure those are paid by the appropriate parties. This is part of the evolution of the collateral onboarding process. ",

[One of] Your friendly Governance Facilitators, reporting for duty  So @monkey.irish is making use of his facilitator powers to insert a domain related request into the weekly polling cycle. We recommended that if this is a recurring issue/plan it really should be part of the MIPs process. However, in this case Robert is saying the legal uncertainty around RWF is causing delays and he proposing some limited scope financing to fix that problem. It will be up to the MKR holders if they support this approach or would like to see it more rigorously defined. As a Governance Facilitator I need to defer to elected experts to recommend urgent changes when they are needed. In the same way that StarkNet is able to insert a poll about their launch parameters, Robert should be able to insert one on maintaining the collateral services. Feedback from the community is encouraged here as we do have time before this is polled if a better solution to the stated problem can surface. ",

My goals are:  Ensure quick decisions (<2 weeks) on professional service spending when dealing with RWAs Involve the community by asking for ongoing support of a collateral using a Governance Poll, go/no-go Assist with the relative priorities of collateral on the CSI  After running these experiments, build the PFR step into the collateral onboarding process Create a budget for professional services so that the collateral stakeholders don\u2019t need to do transfers from MakerDAO to fund the professional services. The PFR would be a go/no-go step from the community on if we want to spend the money already budgeted.  When working with GovAlpha, we agreed PFRs request/Dai transfer would be temporary until we can develop a more permanent solution. I\u2019ve included what I am hoping that will look like in the future. The MIP65 SPF is a very specific request for a legal deliverable, which is needed. What we have found is that every RWA implementation has numerous questions and therefore, we need advice from qualified third parties to ensure we do the proper implementation. Many times, it\u2019s outside of a legal scope. The general SPF MIP process isn\u2019t designed to do what I am proposing in my goals. It\u2019s not an issue with the SPF MIP. It\u2019s just that we need something different that doesn\u2019t exist yet and we have an immediate need. ",

                    "content": "@monkey.irish @juan For the sake of clarity and context. I support the initiative initiated by Robert here with regards to creating a shared funding mechanism for funding work of professional services e.g. legal review initiatives. I had this in the backlog and discussed with @wouter a number of times. It shouldn\u2019t be new to SES. This is just an initial proposal for one collateral onboarding. But it is part of a wider initiative to move towards a narrowly scoped fund for legal work related to onboardings. The intention is that the scope of fund use is much narrower than SPF, around legal services for onboardings. But also its operation is much more efficient than the SPF. RWF has a line item related to legal professional services that has been one of the most contentious, and seriously, a headache more than anything else. With the creation of a shared operational fund we will be able to significantly reduce the dssVest for RWF around services for legal. That shared operational fund still needs to provide operational processes for how it will/should work as well as scope and which obligations apply to fund requesters and fund releasers. The setup of such processes, scope etc can be done via a MIP. More than happy to collaborate with @monkey.irish and @wouter/@juan/@prose11 on that. But all in all, the request from Robert is a step in that direction to create more efficiency in getting access to funding for legal services related to onboardings. Once the fund is operational, RWF can then reduce its legal line item footprint. I think everyone will gain from this. ",

While CES has a professional services line item in our budget, we didn\u2019t anticipate spending it on professional services for RWAs.

The community can decide if the SPFs, MIP55c3-SP6: Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund and MIP55c3-SP7: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund, are still needed if this PFR is approved by MKR holders. @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @strat-fin-core-unit @juan @Nadia ",
