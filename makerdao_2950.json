We have a limited number of executives before year end and there is a healthy backlog of work. Consider this a tentative end-of-year schedule.  It\u2019s very aggressive, which means that for anything on this list, if it doesn\u2019t work out flawlessly, we are moving on.  Please think of this schedule as the best-case of what might happen, and consider it likely to change.  Schedule 2020-11-20: Just configuration changes 2020-11-27: ETH-A DC increase 2020-12-02: DsChief 1.2 executive (rescheduled) 2020-12-11: MIP27 (DC-IAM), UNI, RenBTC 2020-12-18: MIP21 (RWA), AAVE, UNI-V2-DAI-ETH, MIP29 (PSM)  Possible Changes to the Schedule   MIP22 is making a strong effort to hit code complete by the 4th, so they can make it in by the 18th.   Edit Log  Added PSM to the 18th as governance signaled for it Removed MIP25 (Flash Mint).  We decided not to unveil a DeFi Hydrogen bomb right before the holidays.  This was bumped for the PSM. Removed  UNI-V2-USDC-ETH, UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH from the 18th.  We are just going to do one LP token in this executive. Updated schedule for DSChief executive delay Added note about MIP22  Removed PAXG, we will put this off until 2021. Risk team need more time with tBTC, so we are dropping that from the schedule for the end of the year.  But we\u2019ll get back to it in 2021.  ",

MIP21 should come with some tests that we can also port over to MIP22.  At least for our part, if this work is done ahead of time, it makes assessment and implementation easy.  Oracles and risk would still have to weigh in, but I would imagine it could happen in the first week or two of January 2021. Sorry for the delay.  The DsChief 1.2 upgrade really threw off the SC domain team schedule. ",
