To this day, Kromatika is one of the few (if not the only) DEX protocols that implement automated Limit Orders and a Swap Aggregator on the Optimism network. Kromatika utilises the advanced UniswapV3 liquidity and the efficiency of Chainlink Keepers to settle trades automatically as per the user\u2019s pre-defined conditions. Kromatika has automated all the complex procedures and made it easy for DEX users to conduct limit trades. Now, users can trade without front-running BOTs, with no price slippage impact, no swap fees, and also earn a portion of LP rewards for providing liquidity on the trade. In other words, the trade target price defined by the user is precisely applied for execution without manipulation, no fees lost during the swap, and no BOTs will rob the users off their crypto during the trade. Kromatika v2 benefits from an advanced MetaSwap Aggregator as well. This platform aggregates the liquidity from popular DEX aggregators and compares swap data across Uniswap, 0xProject, and 1inch. This allows users to get better market rates than they would get on a single DEX by optimising token pricing, swap fees, and slippage. Kromatika\u2019s mission is to make DEX trading simple, accessible, and profitable to every crypto user who believes in the decentralised value of blockchain technology. Goal :  Bring more users into the Optimism ecosystem via our Marketing Triade plan Increase TVL and daily transaction on Optimism via Kromatika Create new partnership collab with other projects to bring them into the Optimism ecosystem.  Optimism alignment : Kromatika wants to help Optimism onboard new users and increase locked liquidity. Proposal for token distribution : How will the OP tokens be distributed? We created a Triade Marketing Plan, each corner of this triangle boosts the other one, it\u2019s a virtuous circle.  Points scored1200\u00d7742 35.6 KB  Influencer Marketing 50% We\u2019ll create a mass influencer marketing program to make the promotion of Kromatika on Optimism with a focus on 3 unique Optimism features:  3 free swaps on Optimism network only $OP airdrop for Liquidity Provider participant on the Optimism Blockchain Liquidity providing and solo staking on Kromatika Finance   1080\u00d71080 110 KB  We will be selecting quality influencers for this campaign. As a platform, we do not work with \u201ccoin shillers\u201d or pump-dump groups for promotion. We look for good educational content influencers who put out quality content. Our marketing team will ensure the selection of influencers is of the best quality and hence the educational youtube videos and twitter threads they produce will bring in quality users. In addition, the influencers will also be equipped with a referral link, which we will build (see next point below), that can be a useful tool to further promote awareness of Kromatika and Optimism Network. Kromatika is a fair launched project with no external funds, no VC and no ICO done. We are a fully minted project as well. This means our funds are limited, dependent on token prices, and have to be split between the various facets of running a well oiled machine - including dev work, hiring, team maintenance, all bills/cost related to the project. We strongly believe that Kromatika is the solution to the current issues in the DEX space. But, it is quite difficult to do this without a dedicated awareness campaign especially because we don\u2019t have any VCs or big names promoting our product. Hence the focus on marketing (including the building of the referral tool, see below) to raise awareness for Kromatika on the Optimism Network. The new users will be happy with the ease, automation and profitability using Kromatika protocol, and they will also experience the speed, low gas fees and versatility of Optimism Network. It is a win-win. Referral Program 20% Kromatika aims to build a referral program on Optimism first and make it exclusive for 2 months before setting it up on other blockchains. This idea was not part of our official roadmap, but since we are applying for a grant, it will enable us to dedicate funds (if we receive the grant) to pay salaries of the dev team in order to build this feature. We believe this program will help promote new user acquisition. Once created, this Referral Program can be one of the tools that will gain traction among influencers that have a larger following and will help onboard new users to the Optimism Network via Kromatika. Content creators monetize their audience with personal affiliation links for Coinbase, Bybit, Binance. etc. No one has monetized their audience via DEX affiliation yet. The goal is to change this trend and witness a \u201cKromatika affiliate link, on Optimism\u201d under Youtube Influencer Videos, Twitter bio links, and blogs. Liquidity Providing AirDrop 20% Increasing TVL is Kromatika\u2019s main goal and the $OP token presents a wonderful opportunity to attract new users and bring more on-chain liquidity. We are going to reward the users who provide bridge liquidity ( $OP & $KROM ), only on the Optimism Blockchain. Staking rewards : Kromatika will also create a limited time staking rewards for users who stake :  Stake $OP earn $OP Stake $KROM earn $OP  Early users Airdrop 10% A small portion of grant will be used to reward the early Optimism users of Kromatika.This will be one more reason for continued usage of Kromatika on Optimism as it will be viewed by early users as a loyalty reward. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? During the initial phase of the distribution, by temporarily giving 3 free swap fees, using our unique limit order platform, trading on Kromatika becomes more attractive. The users will benefit from an even smaller fee because Kromatika has no swap fees. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Once the new users onboard, they will stay because of the security (decentralized), benefits (Kromatika trading platform benefits), and the network efficiency/speed (Optimism) that enables all of this to happen. Our real mission is to make DEX trading simple, accessible and affordable. DEX trading does not have to be a ridiculously costly affair, and the users will discover this reality via Kromatika and will continue to stay with Kromatika and Optimism. As a Kromatika user, you will discover that:  You are not impacted by price slippage, or swap fees or bot attacks. (so more value for your crypto, no need to sacrifice it for bots/slippage) You do not pay needless fees, instead you earn LP fees. (again more returns on your trade) You do not need liquidity for both Token A and Token B, only liquidity for the token you want to buy or sell. No order delays, but quick execution and fully automated because our limit orders are implemented as liquidity provision around the target price. When your target price is reached, your trade is executed automatically, and your liquidity is pulled out, again automatically. You don\u2019t need to stare at your screen or worry about your orders being \u201cun-filled\u201d ever again.  This is fundamentally different from limit orders (range orders) that already exist in the DEX space which are prone to bot attacks, slippage, swap fees and also delays in the orders filled even if it is trading at target price. Wouldn\u2019t you be happy if as a DEX user you were given these advantages that exist in traditional finance and CEX? Why pay more on other DEX, when you can earn more with a \u201cset and forget\u201d type of automation via Kromatika? Now for the users who prefer only swap trades, Kromatika is an \u201caggregator of aggregators\u201d. The smart program scans the popular 1inch, Uniswap, and 0xProject for the best value for your swap trade in an instant. You will never need to scan multiple DEXs for your instant swaps because Kromatika does this heavy lifting for you. Additionally, Kromatika intends to provide BOT protection for swaps as well (just like our limit orders) in the near future. With the above advantages, it is no doubt that the users will stay once the incentives dry up, because Kromatika offers a solution in the DEX space that is unmatched by others. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The duration of the distribution phase is impossible to predict due to the variable nature of the distribution method. ",

You are giving 20% as swap(from the pie-chart) reward and you are also mentioning 3 free swap under your 50% allocation.  Are they same ? A:- influencer Marketing 50% 1. content creator 2. OP reward on trade volume 3. 3 free swap B:- Referral Program 20% How is this different from above (A.1) ? C:- Liquidity Providing AirDrop 20% 1. staking D:- Early users Airdrop 10% where is the 20%(Swap Reward) you are showing in pie-chart, is that a typo ?

For example, one user might write in depth review of the platform and other might just say \u201cKrom is the best dex\u201d.  \u2192 We have always believed in educational content to create awareness in this space. Even on a regular basis we turn down plenty of \u201cshill\u201d influencers, and choose only educational type influencers. Our marketing team will judge the user content to filter good-quality reviews. Our focus is Kromatika on the Optimism Network, and not just Kromatika as a DEX. where is the 20%(Swap Reward) you are showing in pie-chart, is that a typo ?  \u2192 Yes it was, I\u2019ve taken care of it. Thank you for pointing it out. You are giving 20% as swap(from the pie-chart) reward and you are also mentioning 3 free swap under your 50% allocation. Are they same ?  \u2192 There was a typo on the pie-chart. The correct form is: 20% of the Grant Fund will be used to reward users who provide bridge liquidity ($OP or $KROM). you have referral reward under influencer marketing and under referral program too , how are they different ? I get that in one you are talking about content creation and in other its about individual referral, correct? But arent they suppose to fall under on category ?  \u2192 The 20% mentioned under Referral Program will be the cost spent to build this feature. This is something that we did not plan in our official roadmap but now since we may have additional funds via this grant, we can direct a portion of the fund towards building this feature. The Referral Program is one of the tools for influencer marketing (apart from content creation etc). We envision that this referral program will gain traction with influencers that have a larger following and will help onboard new users to the Optimism Network via Kromatika. One of our objectives with this referral program is that Kromatika on Optimism Network will be featured on popular blogs/vlogs/influencer tweets etc ",

You left me a reply holding one position, and then here you post the opposite position, and justify it via:     Justin:  I am particularly drawn to using the tokens for marketing campaigns to onboard new users. Those efforts could reach beyond the mercenaries and lead to increased adoption, particular if the focus is on educational content.   This is literally what 25% of my requested allocation is for?!?! Why the contradiction on my Proposal? Help me understand this, please, while my Proposal is still in Draft mode. EDIT: Please respond to the request for clarification in the Summa Proposal thread, so we don\u2019t unfairly take Kromatika\u2019s thread off track. Cheers. Kind regards, Axel ",

The crowds will come in once they discover that DEX trading does not have to be a ridiculously costly affair. And, we believe that Kromatika is the solution to the current issues in the DEX space. But, it is quite difficult to do this without a dedicated awareness campaign especially because we don\u2019t have any VCs or big names promoting our product. Hence the focus on marketing (including the building of the referral tool). Once the new users onboard, they will stay because of the security (decentralized), benefits (Kromatika trading platform benefits), and the network efficiency/speed (Optimism) that enables all of this to happen.

That way there is quality and we are not throwing $OP tokens into the wind. The 20% for referral program is for the development of the referral program. This idea was not part of our official roadmap, but since we are applying for a grant, it will enable us to dedicate funds (if we receive the grant) to pay salaries of the dev team in order to build this feature.

As a platform, we do not work with \u201ccoin shillers\u201d or pump-dump groups for promotion. We look for good educational content influencers who put out quality content.   Influencers - and public personas - have historically been selling pressure for most projects and tokens. The benefit does not seem to outweigh risking the same fate for $OP.

The end goal of our entire proposal is to onboard as many new users to the Optimism Network because we are big Layer 2 fans. It is not restricted to Kromatika dApp itself. However, we understand your concerns with influencer marketing. Still, as a startup with zero external funding to be utilized for marketing campaigns, press releases, speaker events etc,  we do feel like our voice is unheard by the hundreds of traders out there who\u2019d surely benefit from our one-of-a-kind solution platform in the DEX space. And, this is why we went with a 50% allocation for influencers. Basically in our thought process, anybody with a decent following who can produce educational threads, youtube videos etc qualifies for an \u201cinfluencer\u201d. We don\u2019t work with coin shillers per se. We really value your input, and if we don\u2019t get through this round of grant approval, we will re-work our proposal after gathering all the delegate inputs here. Perhaps we will reduce the allocation for influencer marketing (and/or hire a PR agency and not having to deal with influencers), and increase the gas refunds allocation. On that note, I am curious if you have any thoughts toward hiring a PR agency instead of influencers. Would love to hear from you. Please do keep us in mind, and go through our proposal if we re-submit it. Cheers! ",

I hope they re-work and re-submit their proposal because I\u2019d like to see them win the grant and then more users to discover this platform on Optimism. ",
