Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP51 adds the MKR Incentive Plan budget for Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent. It contains:  Total MKR Expenditure Cap. Estimated MKR Expenditure (based on the current and projected team). Escrow Wallet mechanism.  MKR incentives have been determined based on the Program discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with 1-year cliff vest.  Total MKR Expenditure Cap The total Expenditure Cap will be 274.106 MKR.  Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess as to how much MKR will be used with the current and forecasted team configuration. The calculation of the MKR Incentives was done taking into account the team at its full projected capacity. Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  A raise for a member of the team. New hires. Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the event of a bear market.  If any Contributor chose to reprice their program, they could do it at a maximum of -30% from the set MKR price:   Price floor: -30%.   Permanent Team Forecast For the permanent team, this would result in the vesting schedule below.     Vesting Date MKR Amount     MAR, 2022 0 MKR   SEP, 2022 31.76 MKR   MAR, 2023 34.24 MKR   SEP, 2023 25.06 MKR   MAR, 2024 25.06 MKR   SEP, 2024 25.06 MKR   Total 141.18 MKR    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the current and forecasted 3 FTEs. On average, this yields 15.66 MKR per FTE per year. Any changes to these amounts will be reported and reviewed by our budget auditors.  Parameters     Parameter Value     MKR/DAI lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6 month average   MKR/DAI lock-in Price MKR = $3,121.70 (1/SEP/21 - 05/MAR/21)   MKR Price Floor -30% ($2185.19)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR amount   Vesting Interval 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes     Payment Implementation This payment implementation is based on the SES MKR budget proposal.  Payment of the MKR tokens will follow the same flow as described in the original MT MIP40c3-SP50 budget MIP    1791\u00d7227 33.4 KB   As defined above and in MIP40c3-SP50, the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages:  Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less, will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the MT Auditors Wallet, which then acts as an escrow wallet. Following the MKR vesting schedule, after review and approval by the auditors, any MKR that is vesting in 3 months or less, will be included in the monthly top-up transaction that moves funds from the MT Auditors Wallet to the MT Operational Wallet. When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor, either directly or through an intermediate payment processor.   Any excess MKR in the MT Auditors Wallet or the MT Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions.  This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the MT Auditors Wallet and the MT Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. MT may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team. ",

Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP50 adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent. The Maker Talent CU will act as a center of expertise, empowering CUs to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner. The Maker Talent CU costing model is designed with the following goals in mind:  The Maker Talent CU is to cover the infrastructure-related (sourcing channels, recruitment marketing, infrastructure) and operational-related costs (Compensation TalentCU contributors, daily operations). 2023 onwards the CUs may be charged a service fee to support the Maker TalentCU\u2019s infrastructure and operational costs. The Maker Talent CU is to maintain a reasonable buffer for unexpected expenses Whereas the Maker Talent CU is covering all fixed costs, the CUs themselves will cover the variable costs (e.g., referral rewards, agency fees, event-related costs, assessment costs) if they choose to make use of any of these options.   Specification  Motivation Going by the critical nature of the work done by the Maker Talent Core Unit, sufficient funds need to be provisioned in order to guarantee the success of the Maker ecosystem in the long run.  Core Unit ID  MT-001   Budget Implementation  1478\u00d7847 63.8 KB  The budget implementation will follow standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit and will involve a setup with an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet which will be topped up on a monthly basis with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce as much as possible the overhead for Maker governance. The MT-001 budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit Providing the protocol control over funds held in the Auditor Wallet. Reducing governance overhead to a minimum Providing full transparency and being kept in check by a group of trusted auditors  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  Streaming the annual budget for MT-001 using DssVest for 1 year A continuous-funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism.   Multisig Wallets The following multisigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multisig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role-based multisigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have 2 roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants. The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have 2 signers\u2014both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role multisig will also have 2 signers, also both SES permanent team contributors. SES will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup. This multisig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2013 One wallet for MT-001 operational expenses. This is a 1-out-of-1 multisig controlled by MT-001. Signers include the facilitator and an additional signer will be added as the Core Unit grows.    Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, MT-001 will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast - A forecast of the Dai amount required to maintain a 3-month operational runway for the team based on the latest available information.  MKR Vesting Overview - A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transactions  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallet that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet    The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in the GitHub repository (To be updated).  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first 5 days of the month, MT submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.   Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, MT submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallet balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 MT-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull - The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the MT-001 DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.   Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by MT-001 to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist, and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings. A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the MT-001\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals \u2013 Upon acceptance of the Monthy Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallet.   Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer. As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.    Auditor Wallet Configuration To enable this payment flow, the following configuration of the MT Auditor Wallet will be required.  Accountant Role Wallet (0xA2A855Ac8D2a92e8A5a437690875261535c8320C) as a signer Auditor Role Wallet (0xB2da57e224949acDDe173a5b8A8160c023ea86e6) as a signer Add MCD_PAUSE_PROXY as a beneficiary, with an allowance of 1B DAI withdrawal. Configure required confirmations as 2-out-of-2.   Transactions   Initial Seed Transfer 311,179.55 DAI will be transfered to 0x5a63814F7dD015c3C2EF038AEE19b0079dC62f30 address on 2022-03-01. This seeds the Operational Wallet to 3x the Month Budget Cap. This also initially funds the Auditor Wallet to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The initial transfer funds the Operational Wallet, enabling the Core Unit to begin operations. This also then positions DssVest to begin streaming funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap each month in the Auditor Wallet.   DssVest Stream A total of 746,830.93 DAI will be streamed to 0x5a63814F7dD015c3C2EF038AEE19b0079dC62f30 starting 2022-03-01 and ending 2023-02-28.    Budget Breakdown The budget is composed of the following categories, as stated below (in DAI):     Budgeted Item 3 Months Annual     Sourcing Channels 17,318.75 69,275.00   Recruitment Marketing 11,400.00 45,600.00   Consultancy 14,000.00 56,000.00   Infrastructure 27,001.00 108,004.00   Contributors Compensation 86,878.80 347,515.20   Operations 5,756.00 23,024.00   Subtotal Without Buffer 162,354.55 649,418.20   Buffer 15% 24,353.18 97,412.73   GRAND TOTAL 186,707.73 746,830.93     Sourcing Channels We will be further building out all necessary sourcing channels to create awareness about MakerDAO contributor opportunities with both active and passive candidates across a variety of channels. Sourcing Channel ROI will be closely monitored and continuously optimized. Given events are in the first place recruitment marketing initiatives instead of sourcing channels with good ROI, we have changed our approach towards events and moved any related expenses to the recruitment marketing category.  Recruitment Marketing Our recruitment marketing initiatives will be focused on defining and promoting the MakerDAO contributor brand. Given that the Maker Talent CU is not an event-organizing unit but a center of expertise empowering CUs to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner, the Maker Talent CU will be supporting the CUs with a branded recruitment marketing toolkit to be used for on-site events. The CUs can request the attendance of any Maker Talent CU contributor if needed as long as the respective contributor has the bandwidth and as long as the CU takes up all travel and other related costs.  Consultancy In order to build all components of the contributor experience journey, we may from time to time require external expertise for specialized initiatives (e.g., GDPR, Job evaluation & Compensation system).  Infrastructure In order to digitize and to provide an outstanding UX for the contributors we will be upscaling and deploying new tools, including but not limited to upscaling our Applicant Tracking System, creating digital onboarding workflows, deploying a gamified contributor referral system, and underpinning everything with a contributor experience management platform.  DAI Compensation Overview of the compensation for the Maker Talent CU contributors which will have 3 FTEs (1 Facilitator, 1 recruiter, 1 operational support) and 2 ad hoc contributors for recruitment/other support.  Operations This refers to all items needed to smoothly run the daily operations of the Maker Talent CU. ",

That usually depends on the complexity of the job. A recruiter can handle between 5-8 tech positions. When it comes to budget, a typical agency charges between 15-20% of the annual compensation of the contributor. Maker Talent will be fully covered by the protocol (it will be free for the CUs), unless the CU uses and external agency, in which case they will be paying the invoice. With an \u201cagency approach\u201d you receive candidates on demand, our idea is to create a great database we can all use. ",

We will include the different team growth phases on the MIP so you can see the way we can expand based on the number of openings the CUs request to us. When it comes to events\u2026 a sponsor ticket of a Blockchain event can cost 20k-40k or more. At Maker we are only doing a few side events and a few talks per year. We need to do more to make ourselves visible to more potential candidates. btw I had to google what a rolodex was not sure how this decentralized futuristic tool will take us to web3 top notched developers, but I trust you  ",
