Instead, or perhaps in the meantime, the Danish Krone (where you just change what you\u2019re pegged to) is a model worth having in mind. It\u2019s non-obvious to me what DAI would be if it\u2019s in complete free-float. Eth free floating makes some sense because it\u2019s effectively taking a cut - via base fee burns - of the underlying Ethereum economy. I\u2019m not against DAI free floating but I\u2019d want to have a better mental model for what that is (something like RAI? that\u2019s pretty hard to understand\u2026) ",
