                    "content": "Hello everyone! I am starting this thread in an attempt to learn a little bit about what (if anything) the SourceCred program has meant to you during your time contributing to Maker. I want to share my personal experience with the program as well as give out a few prompts to jog some thought for anyone who wishes to engage. My experience with Maker was very much one of diving into a Rabbit Hole that just kept going. From the moment I learned about Vaults I was mesmerized by DeFi and how a platform like this could truly revolutionize the world. When I first heard about Maker I didn\u2019t realize how \u201ceasy\u201d it would be to jump into the protocol and start getting paid for my contributions. SourceCred was a huge factor in me \u201cfalling\u201d into the Maker gravity. After writing a rather whiney first post to the forum over a raise to the Dust Parameter, I enrolled in SourceCred because I figured I had nothing to lose. Little did I know that my decision to sign up would fundamentally alter my career trajectory. About a week after enrolling (thanks in part to some lucky timing), I received a little over 50 DAI for my interactions surrounding my first post on the Forum. Already super intellectually interested in the space, that was enough for me to make the conscious decision to visit this space every day. Why not engage and challenge my perceptions with a smart group of people and get paid for doing so? Seemed like a no-brainer. As internal opportunities presented themselves to work and contribute to the Protocol, SourceCred became less of an instrument for me to get paid and more a motivation to share my thoughts and push for initiatives on the forum whenever I felt strongly about something. In this way, the SourceCred program has not only enabled me to dive fully into Maker, but also continually encourages me to share thoughts, give likes, and present new ideas to the community. For what it\u2019s worth, none of that would have been possible without the excellent community already in place here at Maker. I find this group to be intelligent, caring, and innovative in a way that is not easy to find in a \u201ctraditional workforce.\u201d Still, I wonder how things would have unfolded if I was not economically incentivized to start pouring my time into this space. SourceCred was fundamental to bringing me into Maker and I\u2019m curious to hear other\u2019s experiences in an attempt to learn what SourceCred has meant to the community so far. Do you interreact differently on the forum because of SourceCred?  What aspects of the SourceCred program have benefitted you? I\u2019m also curious to hear the downsides! Do you feel that SourceCred fails to capture the work you do on the forum? Are there different ways we could be incentivizing contributions? The goal of this post is nothing formal, I just felt it would be good to catalogue my experience with getting started here and seek feedback on what SourceCred has achieved for others and where it has fallen short. We\u2019re getting more parameters to mess with from the SourceCred Devs so I think hearing individual stories might help guide and preserve positive outcomes on the community. ",
