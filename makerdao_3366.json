Today\u2019s Community Call was actually converted to a community call that\u2019s part of a larger series that we\u2019ve been running at MakerDAO for the last couple of months, the Core Unit Tools series. Core Units need basic services, basic tools. We\u2019re putting together the Core Unit Tools series to cover the different options, the different interesting offerings that are available to Core Units. Today we have Dennis Lund from AccountAble. For other episodes of Core Unit Tools, please check the forum.  Presentation Dennis Lund from AccountAble 01:58  AccountAble1920\u00d71080 113 KB   Addressing issues...1920\u00d71080 124 KB   Servicing a domain team1920\u00d71080 170 KB   Timely deliveries1920\u00d71080 81.1 KB   Other services1920\u00d71080 165 KB   How does it work?1920\u00d71080 164 KB   Fine print1920\u00d71080 164 KB   10:34 \u2014 David Utrobin: There\u2019s this idea of full versus limited service. As a Core Unit you can either completely rely on your entity to do all your payroll, all your expenses, get whatever payment cards you need through your entity, and all that goes through that 10% service charge. But then I\u2019m curious about what your offerings are for the limited service. Let\u2019s say a Core Unit decides to incorporate ourselves, so we\u2019re using our own entity and, for example, we\u2019re using Opolis for payroll\u2026 And really the only thing we\u2019re looking for is help with accounting, by extension taxes, and Dai-to-fiat conversion. What options are on the limited side rather than the full service side?   14:01 \u2014 David Utrobin: Assuming a full service setup through AccountAble, what is the requirement for paying out freelancers that work part-time in Dai? Do they have to go through the whole KYC or can they be on their own and can we just independently pay them with Dai and let them worry about their own side of taxes and stuff?   15:36 \u2014 Payton Rose: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re just a contributor here to Maker, so maybe you\u2019re working for three or four different Core Units. Does that mess any of the extra steps for the user?   15:57 \u2014 Frank Cruz: You said you\u2019ve been doing this for the Maker Foundation. Hypothetically, imagine someone\u2019s starting a Core Unit for selling t-shirts, and they need to go to an event, and the event organizer says \u201cHey, I need you to fill out this form\u201d, and you need to put an organization with the person. Would the person then put \u201cCore Unit T-Shirts\u201d or would they put the name of AccountAble as the entity? Or would they put MakerDAO as the entity that\u2019s responsible for anything that goes wrong at the meetup?   17:02 \u2014 Frank Cruz: You mentioned you\u2019ve been doing this already for the Foundation.   17:48 \u2014 Frank Cruz: In the US, as an example, at the beginning of the year you would send a W-2 to every Core Unit employee?   18:48 \u2014 Frank Cruz: In one of your slides you showed where the community pays out to the Core Unit employee, and you mentioned that you could either use a multisig or you can go directly from your wallet to AccountAble \u2014 but in the US that would incur a taxable event. You\u2019re saying that a multisig would be a better way\u2026   19:46 \u2014 ?: What kind of transparency do your clients expect? Have you had any particularly weird requests to make sure that all of your paperwork is visible to everyone or are they kind of standard across all the clients?   21:02 \u2014 David Utrobin: In which cases would you say that it makes sense to actually incorporate as a Core Unit rather than use you directly?   21:33 \u2014 Frank Cruz: What are some of the downsides here? Hypothetically AccountAble goes bankrupt or the Philippines comes in and it\u2019s like \u201cOk, we can\u2019t have companies that do business in crypto anymore\u201d. What are some of those downsides? How would the employers of these Core Units get paid if things do fall apart?   22:53 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Just the whole experience of getting your Dai converted to euros or dollars\u2026 How long would it take for an employee of a Core Unit to get paid?   23:48 \u2014 David Utrobin: To continue on that, let\u2019s say that we get approved in the May cycle and we get our Dai to a multisig end of May, and we send that Dai to AccountAble\u2026 Is it like a two-week thing, a three-week thing\u2026?   25:14 \u2014 Nadia Alvarez: If I receive the budget for salaries and everything else in my multisig and then I send it to you to pay for salaries, what happened with the taxes when I received that budget in my multisig? Because I\u2019m not a company, I\u2019m an individual person who\u2019s receiving a bunch of money from a Dao. What is the procedure there?   26:19 \u2014 David Utrobin: You mentioned a little while ago about a deposit requirement for Core Units. I\u2019m curious about what the deposit requirement is and all that.   27:48 \u2014 David Utrobin: The only Core Unit budget proposal that I saw that was asking for three months upfront was the Smart Contract team \u2014 and in the proposal they said they\u2019d be keeping it in the mandated actor multisig just as backup. I\u2019m curious how Core Unit budgets will account for deposit requirements like that, specially for salaries because that\u2019s the bulk of most Core Unit expenses.   29:01 \u2014 David Utrobin: What\u2019s the process if somebody wants to onboard or consult you\u2026? What are the steps?   29:54 \u2014 David Utrobin: Let\u2019s say a Core Unit wasn\u2019t passed through governance yet, but maybe they saw a positive result in the first week\u2019s poll and they\u2019re beginning to figure out if they\u2019re going to incorporate and they\u2019re starting to get set up in anticipation of getting passed\u2026 What would be the best thing for a Facilitator to do? Would it be to reach out to you at the beginning of that governance cycle or do you recommend even earlier than that?   31:32 \u2014 Frank Cruz: How does it work if, say, David\u2019s Core Unit hires a freelancer in Michigan, and that freelancer is only going to do a one-time job? David has to pay them 2000 Dai. How long would that artist have to wait to get a payment?   32:51 \u2014 Frank Cruz: And does that artist need to provide their identification because you\u2019re going to have to 10-99 them?   33:36 \u2014 David Utrobin: What are the most common questions that you\u2019ve had from Core Units that you\u2019ve worked with so far?   37:19 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Speaking of Google subscriptions, can you describe the process of invoicing from vendors?   39:37 \u2014 Frank Cruz: If the Smart Contract team is doing an audit with Gauntlet, and they build it for US$100000, you would need an approval. There\u2019s like a threshold of the amount of the invoice to be approved by the Core Unit Facilitator\u2026  40:54 \u2014 Free discussion  44:36 \u2014 David Utrobin: Sounds like AccountAble is going to be really useful for relatively small Core Units because the way that you describe all the responsibilities that accompany incoporation sounds like quite a lot, specially the disolving part\u2026   45:25 \u2014 David Utrobin: I know you mentioned there\u2019s a monthly financial report that you produce for the client. Besides that monthly one, what other things should the client expect to receive from your firm?   47:37 \u2014 Frank Cruz: How do you deal with turning Dai into US dollars or euros? Do you have cut a deal with a brokerage company that allows you not to suffer any slippage?   49:34 \u2014 Nadia Alvarez: I guess if the employee has a salary of US$10000, you will have to pay, Dennis, whatever the conversion rate is at the date he\u2019s converting the Dai into dollars.   51:34 \u2014 Nadia Alvarez: Going to Frank\u2019s question about Dai losing the peg, if one Dai is under one dollar and at the moment you negotiate the conversion rate with the broker, he will give you an unexpected price for the budget I have for the salary. So I have to have an extra budget just in case that happens because I will have to pay you more Dai so the employee at the end could get the 10000 Dai, just in case the peg is broken.   52:30 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Would it be possible that MakerDAo as an entire protocol gets a discount one day? Right now you\u2019re charging 10%, but can we get that down to 8%, 5% if we give you a lot of business and everything runs smoothly? Is that maybe something you can see happening over the next 24 months?  53:29 \u2014 Free discussion Closing Comment David Utrobin Outro  Thank you so much, Dennis, for presenting AccountAble to us. I definitely look forward to see more of you around and I hope people take advantage of your service.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
