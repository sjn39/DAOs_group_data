THE ISSUE I foresee liquidity in Uniswap dropping once the genesis pools for UNI farming dry out Nov 17. My opinion is that the  total value locked (TVL) size of a DEX is what distinguishes DEX \u201cstatus\u201d among themselves.  So having this in mind, How do we keep liquidity providers in Uniswap without much UNI inflation?  THE \u201cPROPOSAL\u201d Every week \\ day \\ x-period of time,  pick randomly (by smartcontract) among x-amount of addresses who are providing liquidity in the top x-number of pools and reward them with a fair amount of UNI. The amount to award per x-period of time can be set to a satisfactory inflation ratio of the UNI governance.  I think this distribution is fair for small and big liquidity providers, and keeps the liquidity providers interested; sort of a lottery ticket. That is the extent of my proposal concept. Please agree, disagree, make comments and perhaps if there is interest there can be more details further developed, discussed. **There would have to be a way (via smartcontract) to avoid people or bots from creating multiple addresses with low liquidity; but those are details. People always find ways to break things. However,  I believe the ISSUE is real, and I hope I made the overall concept clear. Judge the concept. ",

I do think though, as a Liquidity provider, that having the chance to win the whole established supply for a week, rather than just your equivalent fraction of the pool gives it an interesting \u201ctwist\u201d; something like Pooltogether.
