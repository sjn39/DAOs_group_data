It seeks to contextualize the history of RWA tokenization, why tokenization of RWAs is important/what it unlocks, and some predictions for where the industry is going (including a wild one about Flexport!) Finally, we illustrate a landscape which breaks out all the various protocols in the ecosystem into two categories: Infrastructuralists and Asset Specialists. We hope this serves as the household resource for anyone trying to get up to speed on what\u2019s going on in our corner (growing to more of town square) of DeFi. My time at Maker and the colleagues I\u2019ve collaborated with have of course been integral to the production of this resource. And for that I am in deep gratitude.
