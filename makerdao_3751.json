The stablecoin pools offer attractive liquidity tokens that seem to be fairly low risk for Maker. The first pool we could start with is 3Pool - which consists of DAI, USDT and USDC. Maker already has vaults for UNI LP pool so it would make sense to expand to curve.  Reasons to include Curve 3Pool Large and established stable liquidity pool with a daily volume of ~$80m. It seems like a natural extension from the Uniswap LP tokens and proposed Sushiswap tokens etc. I assume most folks know what curve is. For more information and previous application see this post ",
