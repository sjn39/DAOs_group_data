See spell details. This marks a major milestone started late 2021. In line with my initial vision that I communicated from the get-go to the community (also here, here and here) after I became the facilitator of the RWF-001 CU the idea was always to groom personnel so, once they prove themselves, they create spin offs of the original core unit to scale and decentralise RWAs.  The motto has always been: \u201cprofessionalise and decentralise\u201d  The size and the complexity of the total addressable market for RWAs is simply too big for a single unit operating globally and across asset classes.  Opportunity    This is a great opportunity for team folks such as @eumenes and @teej to put forward their names to spin off a separate RWF-002 CU focused in North America, should tokenholders wish so. Watch this space! At the same time, the RWF-001 CU is starting a journey of transformation towards a Metadao paradigm. The key benefit will be increased specialisation, professionalisation and venture building in a more narrowly focused DAO environment purpose built for RWAs. This transition requires new and different sets of talents and skillsets to focus on Maker core consolidation, full transparency automation and organisational change towards a subDAO. The end goal of the transformation is more efficient, automated and faster RWA processing. I\u2019ll cover more on this in a separate post. ",

If I am wrong and missing something I apologise. In addition, as a MKR holder I\u2019d like to understand whether there is an indication that @williamr is indeed the best person available for Maker\u2019s flagship MetaDAO, or whether this role would be open to others to be assessed on. If I understand the MetaDAO construct correctly, those subDAOs are de facto independent sub-protocols. If this is the case, I\u2019m looking forward to hear @williamr\u2019s pitch as leader. In the meanwhile, I\u2019d like to hear what is the mandate to dedicate resources to morph in a setup that has no MKR holder onchain support. ",

I appreciate that the idea of spinning off more RWA teams predated the MetaDAO idea, but to the extent that this RWA opportunity is couched in terms of building towards the Endgame Plan, I recall this slide from Rune:  Screen Shot 2022-07-28 at 8.41.09 AM1770\u00d7930 58.9 KB  Just to be clear, I know this plan is hardly set in stone (as @luca_pro points out, I don\u2019t think there has been any formal governance process around the Endgame Plan). But there does seem to be a discrepancy between \u201cfreezing all further RWA activity\u201d and \u201cspin off a separate RWF-002 CU focused in North America\u201d. ",
