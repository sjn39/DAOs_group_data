Phase 1, Cycle 8 Grant category: Governance Fund, Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling Project description: Socket is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Apps can simply plug in Socket in their apps to get access to liquidity & state of all chains. Asset transfers are live today, with data transfers launching soon. How Asset Transfers Work: We aggregate all bridges & DEXs across chains for efficient asset transfers. The result is ultra-efficient cross chain swaps powered by an advanced routing mechanism that dynamically selects the best bridge/route & optimizes for developer preferences like cost, latency or security. Top wallets, DeFi & portfolio management apps like Zerion, Zapper, Synthetix & Lyra use Socket for a seamless bridging experience in their apps. Some places to try out Socket asset transfers in action:  Bungee (Single txn): https://www.bungee.exchange/ 3  Bungee (Multi txn): https://multitx.bungee.exchange/ 2  Zapper: https://zapper.fi/bridge 1  Zerion: https://app.zerion.io/bridge   Project Links  Website: https://socket.tech/ 6  Docs: https://docs.socket.tech/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech   Additional team member info The Socket team includes super coders with deep engineering & research experience; and seasoned business operators. Some of our team members:   Vaibhav Chellani 1 (Cofounder & CEO): First developer at Polygon; built first ever zkRollup & most scalable Optimistic rollup; Early core contributor at Flashbots.  Rishabh Khurana 1 (Cofounder): 4+yrs of experience launching web2 products (scaled one from 0 to $40mn ARR at India\u2019s first Unicorn).  Arth Patel 1 (Head of Engineering): Early developer at Polygon, built Polygon PoS bridge, ex-developer at Union Protcol, advisor & fren to DeFi projects Varun Bhalla (Product Manager): ex-founder. Last startup had $10mn+ ARR before it got acquired  Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to Our team has prior contributions across Polygon, Flashbots, Ethereum Foundation, Union Protocol, Index Coop, UMA, Harvest Finance, dOrg & other projects. Relevant usage metrics:  Total Volume Processed: $683mn Total Txns Processed: 529k Volume Onboarded to Optimism: $189mn Wallets Onboarded to Optimism: 51k 30+ Projects Leverage Socket for a Smoother Bridging Experience. Projects on Optimism include:  Synthetix Ecosystem: Synthetix, dHedge & Polynomial Web3 exploration app Zapper & Smart, Social Wallet Zerion DeFi dApps: Rubicon, Premia & Brahma Fi Wallets & Portfolio Mgmt Apps: One Key, Plasma Finance, Choise, Ambire Wallet, Sequence Wallet & imToken SoonTM- biggest Optimism dApps, wallets & portfolio management apps    Is/will this project be open sourced? All our contracts are openly available & verified on Etherscan. Our Optimism contract addresses can be viewed here 3 Competitors, peers, or similar projects Our peers are all bridging projects/protocols. Some of them include Across, Hop, Stargate, Synapse, Celer, Multichain, Li.Fi & Rango Exchange. Optimism native? No (as a bridging provider, we\u2019re deployed on 9 chains as of today) Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Dec 2021  Ecosystem Value Proposition  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? We share the Optimism Foundation\u2019s vision that the next billion users should be empowered to experience web3 through the security of L2s. We\u2019re working towards solving one of the key pieces to enable this- seamless user onboarding. Here\u2019s a quick example of what an Avalanche user with AVAX, who wants to stake sETH on Synthetix on Optimism needed to go through:  Leave Synthetix app to find the most cost-effective bridge from Avalanche to Optimism Swap AVAX into USDC/some bridge supported token (fee) Bridge to Optimism (fee) Get ETH from CEXs/Optimism Gateway Swap to sETH (fee)  This is a ton of friction! For users & liquidity to migrate into Optimism at scale, this experience needs to be a lot simpler & affordable. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? There are 2 major problems for users as seen in the above example:  High onboarding cost for user The friction associated with the whole onboarding journey filled with multiple steps (above process requires 20+ steps/clicks)  Socket will use the allocated $OP tokens to solve both these problems for users by using the allocated tokens to:  Reduce the net cost for users to onboard to Optimism Encourage app developers to provide a smoother in-app onboarding experience such that users on other chains can migrate their liquidity to Optimism & start using their app.  This would mean an amazing experience for users which allows them to come from any chain, get any token they want, along with GAS (oETH) to start transacting on Optimism easily & quickly! Here are some ways apps on Optimism are already leveraging Socket to make this happen:  DeFi projects like Synthetix, Premia & dHedge use Socket to allow users to come from different chains and start transacting on their apps easily Web3 exploration apps like Zapper, social wallets like Zerion & more allow users to bridge over (via Socket) & participate in the Optimism ecosystem easily Polynomial, Brahma Fi & more are powering the next generation of multichain apps to get liquidity on Optimism with Socket:  Polynomial is introducing chain-agnostic deposits into its vaults powered by Socket Brahma provides multichain yield with Socket. Deposit into Brahma vaults on any chain, & Brahma earns yield for you on Optimism!    Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The objective of the token distribution is to supercharge our existing efforts of liquidity migration and user onboarding into Optimism. The token distribution eliminates one of the biggest problems hindering user onboarding & protocol adoption to create an accessible & prosperous Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? No Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 How much will your project match in co-incentives? Socket doesn\u2019t have a token and hence can\u2019t match with token co-incentives. However, we plan to allocate significant marketing efforts & resources with our partners to attract users & liquidity. To achieve these we will be conducting marketing campaigns, tutorials, guides & more! We also plan to allocate significant developer efforts & resources to help our partners build great onboarding experiences, or truly multichain apps, along with 24*7 user & developer support. Lastly, we will continue to educate users & community about bridging with things like bridge risk framework 1, which we launched in collaboration with L2Beats.  Proposal for token distribution  How will the OP tokens be distributed? $OP tokens will be distributed to developers building on Optimism & users bridging to Optimism using Socket Users (60%) Every user that onboards to Optimism via Socket (from partner apps) will have 90% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $OP. Total onboarding fee includes the total GAS spent + the bridging fee from the underlying bridges Note: We plan to keep a max cap per user per transaction & minimum bridging amount Builders (40%) We put a strong focus on incentivizing builders on Optimism to encourage great onboarding experiences & migration of liquidity into Optimism. We propose the following allocation strategies for builders leveraging Socket to onboard users onto Optimism:   Developers who integrate Socket as a part of their UX (20%): Teams that integrate Socket as a part of their user experience using our APIs/SDK/Plugin would receive $OP over 6 months pro-rata based on the nominal USD value that their integration has transferred to Optimism.  Grants (20%): Teams building dApps with Socket that makes onboarding & using Optimism easier by building capabilities that allow users on other chains to directly interact with/migrate liquidity into Optimism based dApps with one-click UX. We aim to provide micro-grants to assist 4-5 teams that aim to create massive impact for Optimism and will also keep the governance community updated on the disbursement in periodic reports. Examples include:  Chain Agnostic Deposits: Allow users to deposit into vaults native to Optimism, from any chain & with any token Uniswap LP Migration: Allow users to migrate their LP position on Ethereum to LP position on Optimism in 1 click    Note: Bungee is an app built on Socket, by the Socket team. Hence, Bungee developers (Socket Team) will not be applicable for the developer rewards Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Overall, we expect the distribution will take 3-5 months. It will vary based on the price of $OP & other factors such as gas markets on various supported networks, prices of native tokens of supported networks & developer adoption. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Key KPIs:  Number of wallets onboarded onto Optimism Liquidity onboarded into Optimism  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? The incentives will help bring users to onboard to Optimism & start using their favourite apps easily. Once users get a taste of Optimism, they will want to stay for cheap & fast transactions, seamless user experience & the rich ecosystem of dapps. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) All smart contract addresses are available in our docs here ",

Here is the summary from the report:  The committee and delegates were supportive of our plan to solve onboarding painpoints for Optimism protocols and supercharge their growth     [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Socket   Added value (good to bad): good. Through the Socket, users and dApps could potentially benefit from their crosschain services in the same way that DEX aggregators are often the basis within the interactions of multiple DeFi applications.    The committee recommended we reduce our token allocation since similar proposals had been funded     [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Socket   we believe that the amount requested may be excessive given the expected usage, so we don\u2019t want to lead to a saturation of grants and waste of resources.   We have addressed the committee\u2019s reflection for reduction & cut down the requested token amount by half to 500K and plan to disburse it in 3-5 months. Socket brings a unique value proposition to Optimism  highlighted by the impact we have already achieved across Optimism:     sraim:  Relevant usage metrics:  Total Volume Processed: $683mn Total Txns Processed: 529k Volume Onboarded to Optimism: $189mn Wallets Onboarded to Optimism: 51k 30+ Projects Leverage Socket for a Smoother Bridging Experience.

Is the amount of tokens requested based on any metric? Running calculations on the historical txns for the users we onboarded we found that on average a user coming into Optimism spends $4 in gas + bridge fee We are requesting 1M tokens with 60% allocated to onboarding = 600K $OP or roughly $600K based on average $OP prices So with $600K we aim to onboard 150K users (4$ for 1 user) over 6-8 months which we think is a reasonable target since we have onboarded 30K+ users in just the last 2 months with zero incentives!

                    "content": "Hello @sraim and thank you for your proposal. Socket is one of the best bridge aggregators out there and its value to Optimism is clear in terms of encouraging users to migrate and increase adoption. I see you have incorporated feedback from the last round, and you have answered imortant questions in the previous post about double incentives from bridges and sybil resistance. I would encourage you to highlight them in your comment above so that is it\u2019s cleared that you have taken them into consideration. For gas rebating, I see that you have taken into consideration gas prices on Ethereum mainnet. Is that where most of your volume come from? How about cross-rollup transfers, how much to they weight in your gas calculation? If there are important, I would courage you to add them in your calculation and share them in your proposal so that reviewers have a sense of what is being incentives and refunded. On another note, I see that you have been given feedback by a delegate to reduce your amount asked by at least 60%, and that you have agreed to do so in cycle 7.    [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Socket   we consider it appropriate to request a reduction of at least 60% of the amount requested for the next cycle in case it is not approved in the current cycle.      [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Socket   We propose that we are ready to accept the suggestion of reducing the requested token by 60% for this voting cycle & receiving the requested rest based on milestones we produce(i.e go from receiving 1M upfront \u2192 staggered milestone-based distribution)   I would encourage to justify your change of amount asked in your proposal, or to stick to the initial recommendation so that the proposal has a better chance of passing this cycle. If you feel ready, you can change your title from DRAFT to REVIEW (since you have received two delegates approval that your proposal is ready to be reviewed). Then you will have to post it to proposal in this post. Being one of the first bridge aggregators, I appreciate that Socket is requesting this grant and the goals of this proposal fits well with the goal of incentivizing usage on Optimism. ",

                    "content": " 1. Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.). To begin with, for this proposal we identified a possible conflict of interest between our team members:   @cryptotesters involved in Hop protocol,  @krzkaczor involved in L2BEAT,  These individuals were excluded from assessing this proposal.  2. About the project  Socket plans to be an \u201cinteroperability protocol\u201d, which means that it allows the passing of messages (and therefore assets) between Optimism and other chains for different dApps and using different primitives to make it possible. For now, their released products, Bungee, a bridge aggregator; is based on bridges and DEXes they route the best parameterized alternative with aspects such as latency, costs and security. Additionally, Refuel allows users to send gas for transactions to other chains, with the advantage of not receiving any fee or charge beyond the transaction cost. External links:  Official Documentation Analytics on Optimism  Similar OP Governance proposals:   Paraswap - 450K OP tokens  Hop - 1M OP tokens   3. About the following  The proposal was presented in a previous cycle, and this committee emiting a No because high amount requested, receiving other recommendations and applying again. The new proposal just made changes in the amount request and duration.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Through the Socket, users and dApps could potentially benefit from their crosschain services in the same way that DEX aggregators are often the basis within the interactions of multiple DeFi applications.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. For now its bridge aggregator is seen as a plugin and suitable for less experienced users. However, the presence of multiple bridges with grants awarded focused on a better experience for users could overshadow the current target of its main application. On the other hand, the usability of future Socket tools in dApps is undetermined, which will depend on which ones and their user base (as they suggest some good ideas).  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): almost ready. For now, they have two functional products focused on bridging assets and several integrations, but developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. Subsidies are seen as a standard in terms of encouraging the use of bridges (60%). One remaining for development, this bucket would be destined for future ideas and third party teams working around Socket, there is no way to estimate the success of it and it is at the complete discretion of the Socket team.  Amount requested (high to low): standard. At the moment there is a considerable number of bridges and the like beginning to make use of the OPs granted by the governance (by example, implementing some sort of builder grants and user subsidies). For this reason we requested a reduction of amount of this proposal in a previous attempt. The team was responsive with these considerations and cut by a half.   5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes The proposal seems reasonable. After they have addressed our request about reducing the amount, all the rest of valuations remain as they were determined in the recommendation of the previous cycle. ",

Phase 1, Cycle 6 Grant category: Governance Fund, Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Tooling Project description: Socket is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Apps can simply plug in Socket in their apps to get access to liquidity & state of all chains. Asset transfers are live today, with data transfers launching soon. How Asset Transfers Work: We aggregate all bridges & DEXs across chains for efficient asset transfers. The result is ultra-efficient cross chain swaps powered by an advanced routing mechanism that dynamically selects the best bridge/route & optimizes for developer preferences like cost, latency or security. Top wallets, DeFi & portfolio management apps like Zerion, Zapper, Synthetix & Lyra use Socket for a seamless bridging experience in their apps. Some places to try out Socket asset transfers in action:  Bungee (Single txn): https://www.bungee.exchange/  Bungee (Multi txn): https://multitx.bungee.exchange/  Zapper: https://zapper.fi/bridge  Zerion: https://app.zerion.io/bridge   Project Links  Website: https://socket.tech/  Docs: https://docs.socket.tech/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech   Additional team member info The Socket team includes super coders with deep engineering & research experience; and seasoned business operators.

Relevant usage metrics:  Total Volume Processed: $683mn Total Txns Processed: 529k Volume Onboarded to Optimism: $189mn Wallets Onboarded to Optimism: 51k 30+ Projects Leverage Socket for a Smoother Bridging Experience. Projects on Optimism include:  Synthetix Ecosystem: Synthetix, dHedge & Polynomial Web3 exploration app Zapper & Smart, Social Wallet Zerion DeFi dApps: Rubicon, Premia & Brahma Fi Wallets & Portfolio Mgmt Apps: One Key, Plasma Finance, Choise, Ambire Wallet, Sequence Wallet & imToken SoonTM- biggest Optimism dApps, wallets & portfolio management apps    Is/will this project be open sourced? All our contracts are openly available & verified on Etherscan. Our Optimism contract addresses can be viewed here Competitors, peers, or similar projects Our peers are all bridging projects/protocols. Some of them include Across, Hop, Stargate, Synapse, Celer, Multichain, Li.Fi & Rango Exchange. Optimism native? No (as a bridging provider, we\u2019re deployed on 9 chains as of today) Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Dec 2021  Ecosystem Value Proposition  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? We share the Optimism Foundation\u2019s vision that the next billion users should be empowered to experience web3 through the security of L2s. We\u2019re working towards solving one of the key pieces to enable this- seamless user onboarding. Here\u2019s a quick example of what an Avalanche user with AVAX, who wants to stake sETH on Synthetix on Optimism needed to go through:  Leave Synthetix app to find the most cost-effective bridge from Avalanche to Optimism Swap AVAX into USDC/some bridge supported token (fee) Bridge to Optimism (fee) Get ETH from CEXs/Optimism Gateway Swap to sETH (fee)  This is a ton of friction! For users & liquidity to migrate into Optimism at scale, this experience needs to be a lot simpler & affordable. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? There are 2 major problems for users as seen in the above example:  High onboarding cost for user The friction associated with the whole onboarding journey filled with multiple steps (above process requires 20+ steps/clicks)  Socket will use the allocated $OP tokens to solve both these problems for users by using the allocated tokens to:  Reduce the net cost for users to onboard to Optimism Encourage app developers to provide a smoother in-app onboarding experience such that users on other chains can migrate their liquidity to Optimism & start using their app.  This would mean an amazing experience for users which allows them to come from any chain, get any token they want, along with GAS (oETH) to start transacting on Optimism easily & quickly! Here are some ways apps on Optimism are already leveraging Socket to make this happen:  DeFi projects like Synthetix, Premia & dHedge use Socket to allow users to come from different chains and start transacting on their apps easily Web3 exploration apps like Zapper, social wallets like Zerion & more allow users to bridge over (via Socket) & participate in the Optimism ecosystem easily Polynomial, Brahma Fi & more are powering the next generation of multichain apps to get liquidity on Optimism with Socket:  Polynomial is introducing chain-agnostic deposits into its vaults powered by Socket Brahma provides multichain yield with Socket. Deposit into Brahma vaults on any chain, & Brahma earns yield for you on Optimism!    Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The objective of the token distribution is to supercharge our existing efforts ****of liquidity migration and user onboarding into Optimism. The token distribution eliminates one of the biggest problems hindering user onboarding & protocol adoption to create an accessible & prosperous Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? No Number of OP tokens requested: 1,000,000 How much will your project match in co-incentives? Socket doesn\u2019t have a token and hence can\u2019t match with token co-incentives. However, we plan to allocate significant marketing efforts & resources with our partners to attract users & liquidity. To achieve these we will be conducting marketing campaigns, tutorials, guides & more! We also plan to allocate significant developer efforts & resources to help our partners build great onboarding experiences, or truly multichain apps, along with 24*7 user & developer support. Lastly, we will continue to educate users & community about bridging with things like bridge risk framework, which we launched in collaboration with L2Beats.  Proposal for token distribution  How will the OP tokens be distributed? $OP tokens will be distributed to developers building on Optimism & users bridging to Optimism using Socket Users (60%) Every user that onboards to Optimism via Socket (from partner apps) will have 90% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $OP. Total onboarding fee includes the total GAS spent + the bridging fee from the underlying bridges Note: We plan to keep a max cap per user per transaction & minimum bridging amount Builders (40%) We put a strong focus on incentivizing builders on Optimism to encourage great onboarding experiences & migration of liquidity into Optimism. We propose the following allocation strategies for builders leveraging Socket to onboard users onto Optimism:   Developers who integrate Socket as a part of their UX (20%): Teams that integrate Socket as a part of their user experience using our APIs/SDK/Plugin would receive $OP over 6 months pro-rata based on the nominal USD value that their integration has transferred to Optimism.  Grants (20%): Teams building dApps with Socket that makes onboarding & using Optimism easier by building capabilities that allow users on other chains to directly interact with/migrate liquidity into Optimism based dApps with one-click UX. Examples include:  Chain Agnostic Deposits: Allow users to deposit into vaults native to Optimism, from any chain & with any token Uniswap LP Migration: Allow users to migrate their LP position on Ethereum to LP position on Optimism in 1 click    Note: Bungee is an app built on Socket, by the Socket team. Hence, Bungee developers (Socket Team) will not be applicable for the developer rewards Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Overall, we expect the distribution will take 6-8 months. It will vary based on the price of $OP & other factors such as gas markets on various supported networks, prices of native tokens of supported networks & developer adoption. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Key KPIs:  Number of wallets onboarded onto Optimism Liquidity onboarded into Optimism  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? The incentives will help bring users to onboard to Optimism & start using their favourite apps easily. Once users get a taste of Optimism, they will want to stay for cheap & fast transactions, seamless user experience & the rich ecosystem of dapps. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) All smart contract addresses are available in our docs here ",

Their requested amount is appropriately the exact same as other bridge/cross-chain infra proposals (Hop, Stargate, and Celer). Socket has already onboarded 51k (!) addresses to Optimism, and these incentives would only accelerate users onboarding to L2. I will be voting in favor of this proposal. ",

Estimated spend at:  50 gwei \u2192 $33 110 gwei \u2192 $70  We plan to have a max cap such that users are encouraged to onboard to Optimism even (& especially) during high L1 GAS periods, while still ensuring we can optimize for onboarding max users to Optimism. Based on last few months, we feel cap should be based on 110 gwei i.e. $70 fee. Of course, open to suggestions/feedback here  Also, thoughts on refunding 80-90% instead of 100%? Cumulatively, you\u2019d be able to refund more people, and covering 90% of their cost is a great catch anyway.  This makes 100% sense, as this acts like a discount for users instead of a free functionality. Will be editing the proposal accordingly. Based on the 90% reimbursement, the cap of reimbursement will be $63 (or $60 to round it off) ",

Hence Socket OP incentives will apply    [GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Hop Protocol   Only direct interactions with the Hop Contracts should be considered for $OP rewards. Interactions that go through wrapper contracts, such as those deployed by bridge aggregators, add a ~20% gas premium vs using Hop directly, which works against the goals of this proposal.   Across - Use a combination of referrals to know wallets to reward & also mentioned they are strongly against farming. We plan to request Across to blacklist Socket contracts, so no rewards are received. Hence Socket OP incentives will apply    [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Across Protocol (updated template)   We also recognize that there will be external factors that may lead to farming as well. In such an event, we would expect to adjust the OP rewards distribution in a way that reduces this farming potential. Our goal is not to allow users to farm and sell $OP to bank a profit and not use the optimism ecosystem. We will keep the optimism delegates aware of any such actions, should they ever be necessary. We would like to be the bridge of choice for any user that ever needs to move tokens to Optimism as more and more assets migrate to Optimism.   Biconomy - Their incentives are towards builders and LPs. Hence Socket OP incentives will apply Multichain - No $OP grant. Hence Socket OP incentives will apply Celer - Has plans to use incentives for onboarding. We are in touch with Celer team and can ensure we get blacklisted here too. Socket OP incentives will apply after we do this. 3 -     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Do you mean any tool / service that can be considered a public good for Optimism? Could you elaborate a little more on this?   Could you clarify this question, unable to get you? ",

Is the amount of tokens requested based on any metric?  Running calculations on the historical txns for the users we onboarded we found that on average a user coming into Optimism spends $4 in gas + bridge fee  We are requesting 1M tokens with 60% allocated to onboarding = 600K $OP or roughly $600K based on average $OP prices  So with $600 we aim to onboard 150K users (4$ for 1 user) over 6-8 months which we think is a reasonable target s\u2026     For LiFi, since they are just doing gas rebates which are also unviable to sybil, we feel their proposal & incentives are irrelevant to our distribution plan ",

Here are a few examples of how different apps use Socket & how it\u2019s already benefiting the broader ecosystem:   Wallet & Portfolio Management apps (Zapper, Zerion, One Key, Sequence Wallet, Ambire Wallet & more): Use Socket to allow web3 users to seamlessly bridge into Optimism & interact with the ecosystem. Thus bringing Optimism within reach of users right from their wallets.   DeFi apps (Synthetix, Lyra, dHedge, Thales & more): Use Socket to make it easier for users on non-Optimism chains to start using their app immediately by seamless onboarding into Optimism. This ensures users get a great first onboarding experience to Optimism, and get to try out the secure, fast & cheap Optimism experience, which encourages them to explore the broader ecosystem   There are also apps like Bungee (built by Socket team itself), Via & more using Socket to provide an excellent bridging experience & also solve major pain points like being stuck without gas. These apps enable cross-chain swaps, so users can go from a token on any chain to the required token for the Optimism app in one transaction!   Across all these examples, by enabling a great onboarding experience & narrowing the gap for a non-Optimism user to interact with an app, we have continuously strived to reduce the major problems hindering web3 users from participating with the broad Optimism ecosystem!

                    "content": "Cycle 8 Recommendation made on 11/3/22. This recommendation pertains to the Cycle 8 proposal found here.  1. Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.). To begin with, for this proposal we identified a possible conflict of interest between our team members:   @cryptotesters involved in Hop protocol,  @krzkaczor involved in L2BEAT,  These individuals were excluded from assessing this proposal.  2. About the project  Socket plans to be an \u201cinteroperability protocol\u201d, which means that it allows the passing of messages (and therefore assets) between Optimism and other chains for different dApps and using different primitives to make it possible. For now, their released products, Bungee, a bridge aggregator; is based on bridges and DEXes they route the best parameterized alternative with aspects such as latency, costs and security. Additionally, Refuel allows users to send gas for transactions to other chains, with the advantage of not receiving any fee or charge beyond the transaction cost. External links:  Official Documentation Analytics on Optimism  Similar OP Governance proposals:   Paraswap  - 450K OP tokens  Hop - 1M OP tokens   3. About the following  The proposal was presented in a previous cycle, and this committee emiting a No because high amount requested, receiving other recommendations and applying again. The new proposal just made changes in the amount request and duration.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Through the Socket, users and dApps could potentially benefit from their crosschain services in the same way that DEX aggregators are often the basis within the interactions of multiple DeFi applications.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. For now its bridge aggregator is seen as a plugin and suitable for less experienced users. However, the presence of multiple bridges with grants awarded focused on a better experience for users could overshadow the current target of its main application. On the other hand, the usability of future Socket tools in dApps is undetermined, which will depend on which ones and their user base (as they suggest some good ideas).  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): almost ready. For now, they have two functional products focused on bridging assets and several integrations, but developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. Subsidies are seen as a standard in terms of encouraging the use of bridges (60%). One remaining for development, this bucket would be destined for future ideas and third party teams working around Socket, there is no way to estimate the success of it and it is at the complete discretion of the Socket team.  Amount requested (high to low): standard. At the moment there is a considerable number of bridges and the like beginning to make use of the OPs granted by the governance (by example, implementing some sort of builder grants and user subsidies). For this reason we requested a reduction of amount of this proposal in a previous attempt. The team was responsive with these considerations and cut by a half.   5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes The proposal seems reasonable. After they have addressed our request about reducing the amount, all the rest of valuations remain as they were determined in the recommendation of the previous cycle. This post will be restored to its original version after the completion of Voting Cycle #8. Cycle 6 recommendation currently at the end of this thread: [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Socket - #30 by lavande ",

To begin with, for this proposal we identified a possible conflict of interest between our team members:   @cryptotesters involved in Hop protocol,  @krzkaczor involved in L2BEAT,  These individuals were excluded from assessing this proposal.  2. About the project  Socket plans to be an \u201cinteroperability protocol\u201d, which means that it allows the passing of messages (and therefore assets) between Optimism and other chains for different dApps and using different primitives to make it possible. For now, their released products, Bungee, a bridge aggregator; is based on bridges and DEXes they route the best parameterized alternative with aspects such as latency, costs and security. Additionally, Refuel allows users to send gas for transactions to other chains, with the advantage of not receiving any fee or charge beyond the transaction cost.

About the following  The proposal hasn\u2019t had many consultations since it has been detailed enough, but the proponent responded to the few that have been made. No event or particularity to notice.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Through the Socket, users and dApps could potentially benefit from their crosschain services in the same way that DEX aggregators are often the basis within the interactions of multiple DeFi applications.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. For now its bridge aggregator is seen as a plugin and suitable for less experienced users. However, the presence of multiple bridges with grants awarded focused on a better experience for users could overshadow the current target of its main application. On the other hand, the usability of Socket in future dApps is undetermined, which will depend on which ones and their user base.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): almost ready. For now, they have two functional products focused on bridging assets and several integrations, but developers are encouraged to use the Socket bases for new use cases.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. Subsidies are seen as a standard in terms of encouraging the use of bridges (60%). One remaining for development, this bucket would be destined for future ideas and third party teams working around Socket, there is no way to estimate the success of it and it is at the complete discretion of the Socket team.  Amount requested (high to low): high. At the moment there is a considerable number of bridges and the like beginning to make use of the OPs granted by the governance (by example, implementing some sort of builder grants and user subsidies) and we believe that the amount requested may be excessive given the expected usage, so we don\u2019t want to lead to a saturation of grants and waste of resources. Currently there is no co-incentives.   5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: No.  The requested amount is not reasonable according to the distribution plan and expected usage. In order to maintain a healthy distribution and accountability according to the progress and goals of the proposal, we consider it appropriate to request a reduction of at least 60% of the amount requested for the next cycle in case it is not approved in the current cycle. We agree with the KPIs detailed in the proposal such as number of users and liquidity onboarded into Optimism, but also in the number of dApps and clearer goals set for integrations. This can be better addressed for the next cycle. ",
