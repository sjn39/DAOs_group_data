You can really see the timing of the decline \u2014 when we suspended the burn, we really lost all of our inverse correlation to crypto. MKR used to be seen as a safe haven when other cryptos were selling off due to our penalties + burn procedure. Hard to imagine MKR bouncing back from this one for a whole lot of years. Takes a long time to build investor confidence\u2026 and we\u2019ve bankrupted the confidence of MKR holders. ",

If Maker announced it would return a large part or the whole surplus buffer through a burn, it would be a very high-conviction signal that the growth expectations in the current P/B are not warranted and that there is nothing left to invest in except to return the equity to shareholders. In this instance, you could expect the price to converge near the updated long-term expected value of the token, i.e. its current book value of ca. $100 per token. This represents a -90% decline relative to today. Burning for price action assumes, without evidence, that there is inelastic demand for the token and that market cap will remain flat while supply of tokens declines ergo higher price per token. This has simply never been shown to be the case. Indeed, despite investing millions of DAI in burning historically, Maker\u2019s token value is -85% down from ATH and all of the past burns have been a negative ROI use of capital. Our goal should be to at the very least fulfill but especially exceed the expectations for growth that are priced into the token and over time, when Maker becomes the dominant decentralized rails for financial intermediation around the world and governments start pegging their tokens to Dai rather than the other way around, we can start thinking about returning value (a lot of value) to investors.

I\u2019ve been using DAI a lot but never been eager to buy MKR or use it (cuz of gas fees at most) in governance, but recently knew that you can participate in off-chain polls here and propose things to the Maker governance, which is pretty awesome. Found this post and wanted to ask two things cuz I\u2019m planning to start buying MKR (at discount hehe).   As I already said I\u2019m planning to buy MKR for the first time in the following days, isn\u2019t these bear times good times to incentivize people to buy MKR at low price, participate in governance and help to bootstrap the biggest DeFi protocol to earn big revenues in the future?   Any thoughts on restarting the burn in some near future to again \u201creward\u201d the MKR token holders? I supose there should be topics around this but well, first time here.   ",
