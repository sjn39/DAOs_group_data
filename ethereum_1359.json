                    "content": "TL:DR if we are going to create ERC editor and whole process around it, let\u2019s remake it completely and don\u2019t try to just rebuild the EIP process as ERCs are different thing from EIPs. ERCs are now days compared to EIPs and for the most people they seems similar to EIPs. I personally feel like ERCs should be probably renamed and the structure redirected / delegated on creating more of a list / wiki / technical documentation alike source for dApp devs. ERCs should be seen as technical documentation of how solidity & Smart Contracts functions works. ERCs are defining how something could work, when building dApp developer basically just puts together a couple of solidity contracts together which some of them are documented as ERCs, adds bits of solidity coding and that\u2019s how the dApps are being built I mean that ERCs are more of a documentation and we should not push ERCs to be  in Final. ERCs are not EIPs, ERCs deserves a better naming, better sorting and documented better. Ethereum Devs deserves to be aware of the ERCs as technical documents which could help them build projects. I noticed initiative brought by Ethereum Cat Herders of separating ERCs from EIPs in the ethereum/eips repo. I do support separation of ERCs from EIPs, but if there is going to be allocated someone to do the work of separating ERCs from EIPs why the work needs to be done the same as it is with Protocol layer standards? Protocol Layer Standards - EIPs needs to have its formalised process but ERCs don\u2019t need to go through the same approval process. I do think that ERCs deservers to be understood and marketed differently, they are different so why we should apply the same process to ERCs than we do to EIPs? I\u2019m not a fan of pushing ERCs to go to \u201cfinal\u201d status as the final status does not really tells us anything about the standard. A Solidity function, a feature, documenting how something could be implemented does not need to be implemented on Ethereum chain, all it needs to is to be used by developers and implemented into a projects. I\u2019m happy to work out this proposal more and outline the process for ERCs. Encouraging Ethereum Devs to share your ideas on what do you think about ERCs, and how would you change this process.

                    "content": "tldr; I think the ERC process is okay, the EIP process should be overhauled, and more people need to proactively guide and discuss ERC standards \u2013 It seems like there is a misconception here, probably because how convoluted the process EIPs follow now is.     anett:  I\u2019m not a fan of pushing ERCs to go to \u201cfinal\u201d status as the final status does not really tells us anything about the standard.   Originally, final meant that an EIP was on mainnet and was therefore unable to be changed further. This obviously doesn\u2019t make sense for ERCs because we don\u2019t have an equivalent consensus mechanism as \u201cit\u2019s on mainnet\u201d. The simple deployment of a standard should not be enough to solidify the standard\u2013in fact, this behaviour should really be frowned upon as it can unfairly push a standard to final before consensus on certain issues is reached. However, as of some time in 2020, this isn\u2019t what \u201cfinal\u201d means in the EIP repository. Final means the standard is final and will not be changed further, except for nonnormative changes. It may have very little chance of ever going into a hardfork. I\u2019m in favor of keeping the ERC process similar to now. I actually think this new process of focusing on the standard rather than the governance makes a lot of sense for ERCs. It\u2019s actually EIPs that I\u2019d like to see be treated differently. I don\u2019t think enough people are involved in core development to sustain such a fragmented process. I\u2019d rather governance and core EIPs go hand-in-hand. Having \u201cfinal\u201d EIPs that have very little chance of going to mainnet is not useful, and may even just suck bandwidth from people whose bandwidth is already severely limited. This isn\u2019t to say that people aren\u2019t welcome to bring their core changes and iterate on them until they feel they\u2019re \u201cfinal\u201d. We\u2019re an open ecosystem and this is always an option. But generally, core developers will make minor tweaks to proposals that are accepted. Making your EIP final before release on mainnet is imminent is not productive. We\u2019re getting off track.     anett:  EIPs needs to have its formalised process but ERCs don\u2019t need to go through the same approval process.   I disagree. I think it\u2019s also important to build strong, universally accepted standards in ERCs. I think we\u2019re in a place today where the top 1-3 projects have substantial control over what \u201cstandards\u201d are in place on Ethereum. If Uniswap decided it would support a new ERC-20 incompatible token, the community would scramble to add support. I feel like the ERC space is too reactive. Most people/teams react to immediate needs, rather than consider future desires. I would really like to see some people in the space step up and help lead the discussions on how to improve smart contract standards. Are we really going to just accept ERC-20 compatibility as absolute? Thank you @anett for raising this. I do agree, ERCs are very different from EIPs! ",

Yes, but it would be nice if they would at least release it as an ERC first. Uniswap released NFTs with permit in their v3, I wish they would\u2019ve taken the time to ERC it. That would at least allow for ecosystem review/conversation before it\u2019s out in the wild. fwiw, I also would push to keep \u201cFinal\u201d for ERCs, I feel like we need to figure out why so few make it there. Is it because of a lack of incentive? It does make it hard to tell the difference between a low- and high- quality ERC when even high-quality ERCs with traction are sometimes still in \u201cDraft\u201d. ",
