This enables Maker to deliver on the promise of creating an Unbiased World Currency that is reliable as fundamental infrastructure for both the crypto ecosystem and the global economy, regardless of how external factors may attempt to impact it. An analogy is that this is an attempt to make Dai as \u201cbitcoin-like\u201d as possible. The plan is based on reorganizing much of the existing complex decentralized workforce ecosystem into new self-sustainable DAOs called \u201cMetaDAOs\u201d. Once most of the complexity is removed it leaves behind a simple Maker Core that can realistically be managed through decentralized governance by MKR token holders. The new MetaDAOs will receive significant support and synergy from Maker Core, while running their own profitable business models, as well as their own governance tokens and parallel decentralized governance processes. The tokens and the liquidity and value they generate are in turn used to to provide yield farming rewards for Dai users to power adoption, ETH Vaults that generate fully decentralized Dai, and  MKR that is active in governance. This post details the third major iteration of the plan based on the feedback and ideas from the last several months. It includes new terminology, reordering of the content, simplified tokenomics that reduces the complexity of the plan significantly, and a greater focus on how to practically reduce Real World Asset exposure.  Meta The core underlying theoretical concept shaping the design of the Endgame Plan is \u201cmeta\u201d. \u201cThe meta of something\u201d is a broad concept describing all second order, contextual effects related to human interactions around a particular subject, such as the game theory and political, social and socio-economic conditions that impact the subject. Voter apathy and governance free riders, for instance, are useful example of \u201cbad meta\u201d that can be contrasted to something like Bitcoin Core development or Wikipedia where you have a \u201cgood meta\u201d that enables the project to run entirely based on volunteer work and donations. To reach a sustainable decentralized equilibrium requires a very strong and positive meta, that is also highly stable - effectively near unchangeable. This means a state where a broadly representative amount of token holders(not dominated by one or a few whales) are active and are in near agreement about exactly what Maker Core is and isn\u2019t, including which parts of the system MKR voting can change and make decisions about, and which part it can\u2019t. It also requires the community to have a \u201cself aware meta\u201d where the concept of meta is understood and actively monitored, in order to be able to detect slippery slope situations that could break the stability of the meta, opening the door to things such as arbitrary change and even centralization, corruption or the worst case scenario of \u201crugging\u201d.  Meta engineering Meta engineering means using tools and technology to shape and facilitate the meta of a community. It can be something as simple as having good forum technology, or going further and build towards a \u201cmetaverse\u201d which means an environment that is more conducive for the development of good meta. It can also just mean using memes and communication to shape the meta, such as explicit culture development or simply branding. Blockchain technology and in particular blockchain tokens have provided some of the strongest tools for large scale meta engineering ever created. Good examples of blockchain enabled meta engineering:  Early Bitcoin CPU mining which seeded the initial meta that bootstrapped the entire industry Yield farming of tokens that bootstrapped billion dollar communities such as UNI Unit bias of memecoins like Shiba Inu causing mass speculative adoption by regular people The combined financial and social incentives driving NFT profile picture adoption  The Endgame Plan aims to deconstruct blockchain enabled meta engineering and use it in its most effective and concentrated form in order to achieve the overall goals of Maker to create Unbiased World Currency that generates tangible benefit to humanity through positive externalities such as Clean Money and Resilience against any external threat.  MetaDAOs The cornerstone of meta engineering employed by the Endgame Plan is the continuous incubation of born-decentralized DAOs called MetaDAOs. The ability to continuously create new DAOs with new tokens is a unique opportunity available to Maker because of the high degree of decentralization in the protocol and governance process. MetaDAOs are born with self aware meta and fully functional decentralized governance, which gives them a strong starting point to segregate and parallelize governance complexity that Makers current monolithic governance is struggling to handle. It key mechanism to achieve this that MetaDAOs organize human relationships into self-selecting groups of humans with aligned meta, with less probability of the relationships descending into politics and power struggles. An analogy to understand the MetaDAOs role in Maker Governance is that of L2s. Maker Governance can be seen as a slow and expensive, but highly secure \u201cGovernance L1\u201d, while MetaDAOs are fast and nimble \u201cGovernance L2\u2019s\u201d that ultimately rolls up the security of their governance process to Maker Governance, allowing them to take greater risks. The governance tokens of MetaDAOs are distributed through yield farming to create broad, heterogenous communities, and simultaneously boost the key pillars of Maker\u2019s long term success, which includes Dai adoption, decentralized collateral and governance participation. This creates a strong symbiotic relationship between Maker and the MetaDAOs.  image1548\u00d7778 97.6 KB  MetaDAOs are a unique concept, and it can be difficult to compare them something existing. One analogy is daughter companies in Alphabet, with Maker Core as the Google subsidiary and MetaDAOs as the \u201cAlpha Bets\u201d: the non-core products that synergize with Googles core competencies and have asymmetric upside potential. Another analogy would be to think of Maker as a VC and the MetaDAOs as startups. Both analogies are flawed and don\u2019t capture the true nature of the relationship between Maker and the MetaDAOs, or the process they are created through. A better but more abstract way to think of MetaDAOs, and in particular the incubation and bootstrapping of new MetaDAOs, is cell division. The precursor cell divides, leaving two new cells which share DNA and essential components and infrastructure - and from this starting point they can then specialize into the most beneficial function that maximally benefits their symbiosis.  EtherDai (ETHD) and the importance of Ethereum The Endgame Plan is focused on achieving real long term sustainability and resilience of the Maker Protocol, and one of the most important aspects to achieve this is to leverage the fundamental role Ethereum plays both for Maker, but also for the entire DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum is the largest smart contract protocol, with the longest track record and the most network effect. It also has the strongest and most stable meta, and is the most bitcoin-like of all advanced blockchains. It\u2019s effectively guaranteed that the future of DeFi and eventually most global economic infrastructure will run on Ethereum blockspace, both because of its existing critical mass and momentum, but also because it is one of the only pieces of global financial infrastructure that can survive large scale global instability and economic crisis. The increasing importance of Ethereum as global infrastructure also makes it inevitable that ETH will \u201cflippen\u201d bitcoin and become the top fully decentralized cryptoasset in the long run. Maker is already heavily embedded into Ethereum and reliant on Ethereum as collateral, but with the Endgame Plan this will be taken to the next step, as Ethereum reliance and Ethereum dominance becomes fundamentally intertwined with the permanent end state of Maker Core, and the long term value and stability of Dai. To fully take advantage of this symbiotic relationship, a key initial step of the Endgame Plan is the launch of EtherDai ($ETHD), a new synthetic asset that is controlled by Maker Governance and aggregates the top liquid staking tokens for Staked ETH. The key to long term survival and success of a DeFi protocol comes from their ability to accumulate as much Staked ETH collateral as possible, and by recognizing this while also building a Staked ETH product Maker is optimally positioned to maintain its role as the top DeFi and decentralized stablecoin protocol. This means whenever Maker incentivizes Dai generation from staked ETH in the form of ETHD, or accumulates staked ETH to its treasury in the form of ETHD, Maker is also bootstrapping and boosting the growth of its own flagship product that may be as important as Dai itself in the long run. Initially ETHD is built in a bootstrap version that is extremely simple, but allows it to quickly launch and begin accumulating liquidity, users and be built into the meta engineering enabled by the MetaDAOs. The technical details of how ETHD works and how it is upgraded to its end state is described later in the post under Endgame Plan Product Roadmap.  MetaDAO token farming emissions schedule The yield farming distribution of MetaDAO tokens is the most obvious way that the Endgame Plan uses MetaDAOs for meta engineering purposes. New MetaDAOs are launched with 2 billion MetaDAO tokens (MDAO) available for genesis yield farming during the first 10 years of the MetaDAOs lifespan. The distribution starts at 1 billion during the first 2 years, and then halves every following 2 years. In addition, all MetaDAOs emit 3% of their total supply every year towards permanent yield farming. (Full description of all long run MetaDAO tokenomics is detailed later) The genesis and permanent yield farming is split between 3 general categories:   20% of the MDAO token distribution goes to Dai farming, boosting Dai demand and providing a very widespread token distribution   40% of the MDAO token distribution goes to ETHD vault farming, that provide rewards based on active vault debt. This creates an unprecedented incentive for users to generate more fully decentralized Dai overcollateralized by ETH that is providing a staking yield in addition to the MDAO farming yield   40% of the MDAO token distribution goes to the delegated MKR farming. This provides a powerful voting incentives that will immediately increase voter participation and ensure there is a very broad voter base powering the delegates, reducing the influence of whales.   The distribution between the 3 assets ensures a wide and heterogenous distribution of new MetaDAO governance tokens while remaining aligned with Maker and MKR holders, maximizing the conditions that a completely new community can emerge with a new and unique, self-defined meta that is compatible with the broader Maker ecosystem. The relative balance of the token farming incentives heavily favors increasing Dai supply generated from decentralized collateral over increasing Dai demand, with twice as much going to the ETHD farm over the Dai farm. This is a critical step towards realizing the vision of an Unbiased World Currency.  image1166\u00d7996 172 KB  (Illustrated with relative percentages and absolute amount per year for the first 2 years)  Active supply and demand levers In addition to the new introduction of MetaDAO token farming and the impact it will have on driving more decentralized ETHD collateral into the Dai collateral portfolio, the Maker Protocol has multiple features implemented that can dynamically impact supply and demand of Dai, and which can also be used to impact the composition of the collateral portfolio.  Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and Stability Fee Base Rate (SFBR) The DSR and the SFBR are mechanisms that help the Maker Protocol protect the Dai peg from downside risk. The DSR allows users to earn a simple yield on holding Dai funded directly from the Surplus Buffer, while the SFBR increases the stability fee of some or all vaults, increasing income to help fund the DSR. This increases demand for Dai, while decreasing supply, resulting in upward pressure on the price.  Target Rate (TR) The TR is a mechanism that continuously changes the Target Price of Dai over time. Once engaged, Dai will free float away 1:1 with USD by gradually changing its price over time according to the target rate. PSMs and liquidations will follow the Target Price when determining their prices. A positive TR has the same theoretical effect as an increased DSR and SFBR: It increases demand for Dai and reduces supply of Dai. A negative TR has the opposite effect: It reduces demand for Dai, and increases supply. The TR is an extremely powerful tool that enables Maker to put a hard limit on how much RWA exposure the protocol has, while also encouraging more Dai generation from decentralized collateral such as ETHD. However the cost is also very high, and permanent, as once the peg has been broken the schelling point that 1 Dai equals 1 Dollar can never be regained. The Endgame Plan ultimately assumes that a regulatory crackdown on RWA collateral is likely, and as a result it prioritizes resilience against physical attacks over maintaining the 1:1 USD peg. This will have major ramifications for the protocol, and when it is first activated there could be an immediate massive outflux of users. Losing as many as 50% of the protocol users in a short period of time after free floating is a real possibility. However, it is ultimately worth it because of the risk that existential reliance on RWA poses to Maker, and the long term benefits of being truly decentralized will be greater as it will significantly improve the meta of Maker in the long run by giving it a real purpose and unique value proposition compared to centralized stablecoins.  Protocol owned vault The protocol owned vault is a mechanism that\u2019s very different from DSR + SFBR and TR, but also crucial in enabling the Endgame Plan to control the collateral portfolio backing Dai, and highly synergetic with having a negative TR. The Protocol Owned Vault is a special Maker Vault only usable by Maker Governance that holds ETHD and potentially other decentralized assets as collateral, and then uses it to generate Dai. It cannot be liquidated and has no Stability Fee. Maker Governance can use it to generate more Dai and purchase ETHD with the newly generated Dai, in order to directly increase the share of Dai backed by decentralized collateral, and also take advantage of a potential negative TR. Having a large collateral pool available that can be used to power a large scale Protocol Owned Vault makes it must safer to activate a negative TR and free float Dai, because it can step in to generate more Dai if the TR gets overly negative - benefitting users of Dai while also allowing the Maker Protocol to earn significant yield both from ETH staking and exposure to debt with negative rates.  Endgame Collateral Categories The Endgame Plan aims to use meta engineering and carefully designed incentive balancing mechanisms to target a collateral portfolio that fulfills the vision of an Unbiased World Currency. This ultimately requires two overall types of collateral: Decentralized assets that can physically guarantee the unbiased characteristic, and Real World Assets that can provide reliable liquidity and stability, while also creating tangible impacts showing the benefits of what DeFi, Maker and the Dai Stablecoin can bring to the world. These two broad types of decentralized and RWA collateral are further broken down into 8 collateral categories. Some of them are manually monitored and controlled through Maker Governance and risk advice, others are automatically measured and controlled via incentive levers.  colcat1087\u00d7668 98.1 KB   Decentralized collateral  ETH Examples: ETH, Liquid Staked ETH tokens, EtherDai, ETH/DAI LP tokens To become unbiased and resistant to attacks from global powers a significant amount of ETH is required as native blockchain staking tokens are the only assets that are guaranteed to be truly decentralized and resilient at scale. The Endgame plan directly incentivizes increase in ETH collateral through the MetaDAO yield farming for ETHD, and uses the Protocol Owned Vault to accumulate more ETHD over time.  Misc Decentralized Examples: UNI, LINK, and LP tokens based on such assets Miscellaneous decentralized assets are also useful in making Dai as decentralized and unbiased as possible, although only rarely are they scalable enough to be useful as collateral directly in Maker Core, and are in instead mostly the responsibility of MetaDAOs (the mechanisms for this are explained further later)  MKR The Endgame Plan significantly changes how the MKR asset is used and its economic characteristics. The liquidity backstop is no longer enforced, and instead becomes optional subject to a governance decision. Instead the possibility of passing on a loss to Dai holders through a haircut to the Target Price becomes explicitly possible (it is already technically possible for Maker Governance to do this today, but not supposed to happen based on expectations and current meta). The reason why this makes sense is because the backstop mechanism of MKR isn\u2019t very useful in the first place, because the moment when you actually need it MKR will typically be near worthless anyway, resulting in no effective protection. Meanwhile, once the role of automatic backstop is removed, MKR becomes a very useful form of decentralized collateral for Dai through overcollateralized vaults that can generate stability fees for the protocol, and participate in governance while also farming MetaDAO tokens. This allows MKR to play an important role in reducing exposure to seizable RWA.  MDAO MetaDAO tokens are also a source of decentralized collateral that can be used in overcollateralized vaults to generate fully decentralized Dai. However, MetaDAOs do have the role of providing a forced backstop to risk generated within the MetaDAOs. As a result the amount of exposure that Dai has to the tokens of each MetaDAO must be heavily restricted.  Real World Asset collateral  Cashlike RWA Examples: Centralized Stablecoins, Short Term Government Bonds To maximize its usefulness as a currency, especially when still at small scale and growing, Dai needs to have a reliable exchange rate and deep liquidity to other stablecoins and cashlike assets. This is achieved through Cashlike collateral, which is a portfolio of on-chain and off-chain stablecoins and low risk, short term bonds. It is actively monitored and managed by the Stability & ALM Tribunal (This is described further in Scopes). The major downside with Cashlike RWA is that it is easily seizable, so in the long run the total exposure must be limited to prevent risk of sudden death.  Clean Money RWA Examples: Renewable energy projects, sustainable agriculture assets To achieve global adoption a brand that is mainstream relevant is required - Clean Money collateral makes this possible through the highly positive meta it generates and the Clean Money brand. Just like Cashlike RWA, Clean Money RWA assets are easily seizable. One major advantage on this front is that the positive meta and branding they generate could help create popular resistance and impose a political cost on attempts to seize the assets, or in general seize any assets or attack Maker in other ways.  Misc RWA Examples: WBTC, cross-chain bridge tokens from L1\u2019s, Security Token Vaults Miscellanous RWAs are on-chain assets that are centralized and don\u2019t fit into another category. They are seizable, but sometimes can have the disadvantage that they don\u2019t immediately appear to be RWAs and as a result Maker might fail to take proper precaution of the seizure risk.  Physically Resilient RWA The Endgame Plan assumes that at a point in the future there will be a severe crackdown on use of RWA in crypto, and anything that can be seized by global powers will be at serious risk of seizure through legal means. Physically Resilient RWA are real world assets that cannot easily be seized, and that a DAO like Maker can retain some level of technical sovereignty over. This is a very challenging concept to design and create, and it will take years or decades before it is realizable. A hypothetical example of what future Physically Resilient RWA could look like are renewable powered drone ships that can be disabled and re-enabled through on-chain governance and operate long term in international waters.  The Unbiased World Currency Stances The Endgame Plan requires the Maker Protocol to be able to handle the possibility that there will be a significant deterioration of regulatory security alongside a global economic and social decline. To be able to adapt to this changing environment, the Maker Protocol will adopt different \u201cstances\u201d that determine the functionality of the economic levers that impact the collateral makeup of the Dai Stablecoin. This prepares the Maker Protocol to survive and recover from the realistic worst case scenarios that can occur over the coming years and decades. The overall multi-year strategy can be thought of as first focusing on \u201cworld currency\u201d by prioritizing keeping the 1:1 USD peg and not putting a limit on RWA exposure, and then switching to focus on \u201cunbiased\u201d by allowing the peg to break and enforcing hard limits on RWA exposure. The switch to a new stance is triggered by certain conditions that are determined up front as a part of the Endgame Plan approval, providing long term certainty and risk guarantees to users of the Maker Protocol. There are three stances:  Pigeon Stance where there is no limit to RWA exposure and Dai remains pegged 1:1 with USD Eagle Stance where Dai becomes free floating with a negative Target Rate Phoenix Stance where Dai no longer allows any RWA other than Physically Resilient RWA  Each of these Stances have a set of Automatic Targeting Rules, which are global rules implemented with automatic smart contracts that measure the state of the collateral portfolio and then react by adjusting incentive levers such as the Dai Savings Rate, the Stability Fee Base Rate, and the Target Rate. The Automatic Target Rules measure and react to the concentration of different categories of collateral in the portfolio. So for instance RWA > 25% = X means \u201cif the total concentration of Dai backed by Real World Assets in the portfolio exceeds 25%, then X happens\u201d.  Pigeon Stance  image1200\u00d7800 138 KB  Pigeon Stance is the first stance that \u00a8Maker starts in at the moment of the Endgame Plan Launch. The name is inspired by the evolutionary advantage of Pigeons: Low fear of humans makes it a lot easier for them to scavenge leftover food in cities, allowing them to reproduce in massive numbers. Similarly, Pigeon Stance is suitable for Maker as long as the regulatory threat is still minimal and global economic conditions are stable, and during such optimal conditions for generating income from RWA the objective for Maker should be to \u201cfatten up\u201d and accumulate as much ETH as possible into the Protocol Owned Vault, which will help the protocol overcome the challenges of reducing its reliance on Real World Assets in long run and reduce the risks that the target rate will become overly negative once Eagle Stance is activated. Pigeon Stance lasts 2.5 years (30 months), and the protocol then automatically switches to Eagle Stance after having had 3 years of preparation. Should the external threats to Maker be much better understood and it is clear there is no immediate risk, then Pigeon Stance can be extended in order to further build up the Protocol Owned Vault.  Collateral Targeting and cashflow Rules of Pigeon Stance   If Cashlike RWA < 10% = DSR and SFBR begin to automatically increase   If Cashlike RWA > 15% = DSR and SFBR automatically decrease until 0%   If Clean Money RWA < 5% = Propose increase in debt ceilings to MetaDAO Clean Money Vaults if good deals are available.   Physically Resilient RWA counts as only half RWA for the purposes of these calculations. So as an example if there is 10% exposure to Cashlike RWA and 20% exposure to Physically Resilient RWA, it would count as a total RWA exposure of 20% for the sake of calculating the targeting rules.   If RWA > 25%: 90% Of protocol surplus must go to accumulate ETHD for the Protocol Controlled Vault    Eagle Stance  image1600\u00d71071 74.1 KB  Eagle Stance is becomes active after 2.5 years of Pigeon Stance, or in a rare situation where it provides a clear regulatory benefit to not have a 1:1 pegged stablecoin. It is named after the Theodore Roosevelt quote: \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d Eagle Stance guarantees that Maker\u2019s exposure to seizable RWA is limited to no more than 25%, and to achieve this Dai in unpegged from the dollar if necessary. The result is that Dai is able to survive even the most severe regulatory crackdown or physical attack, but at the same isn\u2019t severing its ties with the real world and is still able to take advantage of RWA liquidity and Clean Money projects that demonstrate the positive impact of letting DeFi flourish. Eagle Stance has a 6 month windup period where there is a limit to how negative the TR can get. This limit is removed after 6 months.  Targeting Rules of Eagle Stance   Physically Resilient RWA counts as only half RWA for the purposes of these calculations. So as an example if there is 10% exposure to Cashlike RWA and 20% exposure to Physically Resilient RWA, it would count as a total RWA exposure of 20% for the sake of calculating the targeting rules.   If RWA > 25% within 6 months of entering Eagle Stance: TR starts to decrease to a minimum of -5%   If RWA > 25% after 6 months of entering Eagle Stance: TR starts to decrease with no minimum   If RWA < 25%, Cashlike < 10% and TR < 0%: TR starts to increase up to a maximum of 0%   If RWA < 25%, Cashlike < 10% and TR = 0%: DSR and SFBR starts to increase   If RWA < 25% and Clean Money RWA < 10%: Make governance proposals for increased Clean Money RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available.   If Physically Resilient RWA < 25% (after accounting for 50% weight multiplier for Physically Resilient RWA): Make Governance proposals for increased Physically Resilient RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available.   If Clean Money RWA +  Physically Resilient RWA > 25% (after accounting for 50% weight multiplier for Physically Resilient RWA): Begin to slowly liquidate Clean Money RWA projects.    Phoenix Stance  image1920\u00d71080 166 KB  Phoenix Stance is the final stance of the Endgame Plan, where Maker and Dai reaches their final, long term form of maximum resilience and survivability. It is only triggered if there are clear signs of an impending attack on the RWA collateral, or if there is general global economic and geopolitical instability. The main characteristic of Phoenix Stance is that it no longer allows easily seizable RWA as collateral, so only Decentralized Collateral and Physically Resilient Collateral is used. This also means that PSMs will no longer function, and as a result the Target Rate will be modified based on Market Price deviation rather than PSM collateral. Additionally, it is possible that while Phoenix Stance is active there are no major currencies to use as price references, making it impossible to calculate a Market Price through an exchange rate. Instead, inflation of Dai purchasing power relative to a consumer price basket chosen by Maker Governance must be calculated directly by the Stability and Liquidity Scope (Explained further later)  Targeting rules of Phoenix Stance   Cashlike RWA, Clean Money RWA and misc RWA are not allowed as collateral in Phoenix Stance. Any remaining Cashlike RWA, Clean Money RWA or Misc RWA is \u201cuprooted\u201d, which means that all of the assets are immediately converted to ETHD and the debt and ETHD proceeds is transferred to the Protocol Owned Vault.   Physically Resilient RWA has no weight modifier like in Eagle Stance, as it is now the only type of RWA available.   If Physically Resilient RWA < 50%: Make governance proposals to increase Physically Resilient RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available.    The role of MetaDAOs in the Maker Ecosystem  image1912\u00d71656 260 KB  The core value proposition of the MetaDAOs is that they can segregate, derisk and parallelize Makers highly complex governance processes. The myriad of relationships with workforce contributors, service providers and counterparties will be restructured into much fewer relationships with self-organizing, self-sustainable MetaDAOs that are shaped by a free market evolutionary process in the broad Maker Ecosystem. The second major value proposition of MetaDAOs is that they act as blank slates with resources and processes already in place for a completely new community and decentralized workforce to pursue all opportunities they discover in the blockchain ecosystem. MetaDAOs have near total freedom in developing such \u201cexternal facing products\u201d and this means that Maker Core can safely lock down its scope of governance and still not be left behind from the upside of major innovation that will occur in the space in the future, as Maker still has exposure through the MetaDAOs. The key to make it work well is that each MetaDAO is well positioned to develop a new community with a unique, self-aware meta through the fully decentralized and fair launch distribution of the MetaDAO governance tokens. This creates a higher likelihood that some of them will be able to achieve strong and stable meta resulting in sustainable, effective governance and viral growth with minimal corruption and free rider problems. MetaDAOs run their governance processes on top of the Maker Core governance infrastructure - this means that actual physical control of MetaDAO owned protocols and treasury is held by MKR voters, but is in practice controlled by MetaDAO voters through signal polls that are then executed in bundled Maker Executive Votes. This makes it possible for MetaDAOs to have fully decentralized token distribution from genesis without being vulnerable to governance attacks and take more risks that can have unknown impacts on their meta, because the Maker Governance process can always act as an \u201cappeals court\u201d in case a governance breakdown happens. From the moment their tokens are distributed, MetaDAOs can immediately spring to action and use their fully decentralized governance process to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.  The three MetaDAO classes  image1718\u00d7800 116 KB  There are three distinct classes of MetaDAOs with unique roles in the Maker Ecosystem: Governors, Creators and Protectors. The class of MetaDAO determines how it interacts with Maker Core, but beyond that all MetaDAOs are completely free to pursue all external facing products, services and protocols using their available workforce and resources.  MetaDAO Frontends Central to the fundamental value of all MetaDAOs are their MetaDAO frontend. MetaDAO frontends are the primary place for a MetaDAO to express its brand and meta in order to connect with new users and community members. All MetaDAO frontends have the same base features, but different classes will focus on different features and all MetaDAOs will have unique branding and design. Initially, the MetaDAO frontends are relatively simple and many of the features may be directly copied from other products. In the medium term the goal is that all MetaDAO frontends are fully decentralized and provide multiple redundant options for state of the art financial security, financial resilience and financial privacy easily accessible to regular people.  Maker Vaults, revenue share and farming  image1694\u00d7934 164 KB  The main product that all MetaDAOs make available on their frontends are Maker Vaults, and in particular ETHD Vaults that have active MetaDAO yield farming. All MetaDAOs earn a significant revenue share of 25% of all net stability fees generated from Vaults managed through their frontend. Additionally, the MetaDAO farming allows the MetaDAO to promote farming and holding their own governance token, helping them to expand their community and strengthen their meta. While Maker Vaults are an important feature in all MetaDAO frontends, Creators focus on it particularly much since their specialty is marketing, UX and innovation of DeFi products. Dai farming is also a key feature MetaDAOs provide in the frontends.  Governance interface All MetaDAOs also run governance interfaces in their frontends. Both a version for their internal governance, but also a complete version of the end to end Maker Governance process that keeps up with the latest updates and proposals of Maker Governance, and provides easy access to MKR faming of MetaDAO tokens. This helps diversify the access points to Maker Governance, making it more resilient to attacks or technical failure, in particular once the MetaDAO frontends migrate to being fully decentralized. This is a particular focus for Governors, since in general they aim to attract a community that is interested in decentralized governance. Once the Long Term Singularity Engine has been developed (described in Endgame Plan Product Roadmap, below), it will open up for a revenue share opportunity for MetaDAOs that attract MKR holders to Maker Governance and lock up into the Magic Engine.  Deep dive on the 3 MetaDAO classes  Governors  Governors, or GovernorDAOs, are responsible for organizing the Decentralized Workforce of Maker Core, and generally enhance governance participation and function of the Maker ecosystem. They operate Councils, Core Units and Tribunals based on the Results Guarantee system. The Results Guarantee system works by giving the Governors additional overhead fees on top of the base budgets that are paid to the Decentralized Workforce. In return the Governor can be held accountable for issues that occur - this transfers the operational risk of running the Decentralized Workforce from Maker Core to the Governors. The entire Decentralized Workforce and Maker Governance Process is broadly divided into 11 focus areas known as Scopes, with 4 Primary Scopes and 7 Supporting Scopes (The actual Scopes and what they cover is explained in the DAO Scopes section below). The 4 Primary Scopes each have a single Council, and multiple Core Units, while the 7 Supporting Scopes each have just one Tribunal.  Councils Councils advise Maker Governance on how to best design the transparent, open source Scope Frameworks that the rest of the Decentralized Workforce within that Scope must adhere to and which defines their KPIs. Councils do not have any operational role, and have no governance privileges or budget responsibility beyond working on the Scope Frameworks.  Core Units Core Units are the top operational units in the decentralized workforce. Their main function is to control the budgets allocated to each Scope, as well as access the governance fast track for proposals directly related to their Scope. Each Governor can operate a Core Unit within each Scope, and a Scope can have more than one Governor operating a Core Unit, which creates internal redundancy and parallelization in the Decentralized Workforce. Core Units work as RFP/outsourcing hubs - they don\u2019t do the heavy lifting themselves, but instead specialize in creating public bidding processes for projects defined by the Scope Map for their particular Scope. MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors compete to carry out the work under the supervision of the Core Unit, using its budget and governance privileges to execute the work.  Tribunals The Supporting Scopes, which generally are smaller and require fewer resources, but must be considered directly by Maker Governance, are coordinated at the highest level by Tribunals that combine the role of Council and Core Unit. All Governors participate in all Tribunals, and they have shared responsibility for proposing changes to the Scope Framework and controlling a single, shared budget.  Creators  Creators, or CreatorDAOs, focus on growth and innovation in the Maker ecosystem and the fully decentralized, deep crypto ecosystem. They are the most open ended of the MetaDAO classes in terms of which direction and evolutionary path they can take, because their focus is raw innovation and experimentation, both with technology but also with branding and meta development. Their unique interactions with Maker include Vault Adoption of decentralized Vaults and receiving special \u201chome base\u201d benefits on a specific L2s.  Decentralized Vault Adoption Creators can \u201cadopt\u201d existing or new vault types on the Maker Protocols Vault Engine. Vault Adoption requires that Maker Governance first passes MIP giving the Creator a Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling, and a Vault Adoption Cost of Capital. The Creator then uses its internal governance process to adopt specific vault types, as long their total Debt Ceiling doesn\u2019t surpass the total Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling. Adopted Vaults behave differently than normal Vaults. First, they only pay a fixed part of their stability fee to Maker Core, which is defined by the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital. Additionally, if they have issues with liquidations or otherwise cause losses, the Creator is fully responsible to take first loss on all downside. Longer term, adopted vaults are replaced with MetaDAO Lending Engines  image1776\u00d7978 191 KB   Home base Creators each choose a Home Base, which is an L2 or shard with an active Maker Vault Engine. The Creator then receives a 1% revenue share of all net stability fee income from that Vault Engine. In return this incentivizes the Creator to participate and develop the adoption and integration of the Maker Protocol on the shard, and gives Maker Core a way to directly engage with specific L2s and Shards in a parallelized and decentralized manner.  Decentralized Workforce participation As described under Core Units, in the Endgame Plan the Decentralized Workforce is managed at the highest level by the Governors, but in order to enforce decentralization and transparency, the actual execution work is done by independent parties that compete with each other in free and open processes to get the budget. Creators are particularly well suited to complete tasks related to technological development and web3 marketing.  Protectors  Protectors, or ProtectorDAOs, are MetaDAOs focused on intermediating Maker Cores interaction with the physical world. Their primary focus is to allocate collateral to real world assets, including Filler RWA Collateral and Clean Money RWA Collateral. They also have responsibility for protecting Maker against physical and legal threats to its RWA collateral. Their unique interactions with Maker Core include RWA Vault Adoption and Phoenix Staking.  RWA Vault Adoption Like Decentralized Vault Adoption for Creators, Protectors can obtain a Vault Adoption MIP that provides them with a Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling and a Vault Adoption Cost of Capital. Protectors can only adopt RWA Vaults that either conform to the Cashlike RWA Collateral standard or the Clean Money RWA Collateral standard, which is determined by the RWA Collateral Scope Framework created by MKR holders with advice from the RWA Collateral Council. The Protector can use its internal governance to allocate up to its Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling to its Arrangers, and the return generated by the Arrangers is split between Maker, which earns the Vault Adoption Cost of Capital, and the Protector, which earns anything in excess of that. In case there are losses from liquidations or default, the Protector takes first loss with all of its assets, and the Protector is also fully responsible for paying all expenses related to the Adopted Vaults. Protectors have two distinct Vault Adoption MIPs, one governing their Cashlike RWA collateral, and one governing their Clean Money RWA collateral. Cashlike RWA Collateral for a particular Protector can have an effectively unlimited debt ceiling as long as there is excess Cashlike Collateral that must be reallocated according to the RWA Collateral Scope Framework. Clean Money RWA Collateral requires two layers of Junior Capital in order to scale up its debt ceiling, both at the Arranger level and also at the MetaDAO level.  image1754\u00d7986 153 KB   Phoenix Staking Phoenix Staking is a unique feature that all Protectors must offer once the technology has been developed. It enables users to deposit ETH into a smart contract, where the ETH then both earns staking yield, and on top of that also earns an additional risk premium. The ETH is then used to take first loss if there are RWA losses from Vault Adoption by the Protector, 50/50 alongside the Protectors own reserves. Additionally, if the Maker Protocol is forced to rapidly exit all of its RWA exposure (An uprooting event when entering Phoenix Stance) due to a severe external threat, all the Phoenix Staked ETH is paid out to Maker Core in order to strengthen its resilience in such a damaging situation. Protectors pay 20% of their surplus to fund the Phoenix Staking Risk Premium. (The full details of the MetaDAO tokenomics are explained below)  Decentralized Workforce Participation Protectors are well positioned to use their internal workforce resources to execute on project for Core Units related to the real world in some way, such as real life marketing or anything that requires legal work or review.  Creator and Protector Vault Adoption mapped to Collateral Categories The collateral categories were explained earlier, and now that the MetaDAO classes have been introduced and the Vault Adoption mechanisms of Creators and Protectors, it is possible to map which collateral categories are the responsibilites of Creators and Protectors, and which collateral categories Maker Core still directly manages through the Maker Vault Engines.  colcatmeta1108\u00d71292 141 KB   MetaDAO clustering and workforce MetaDAOs have an internal governance process that is similar to the governance process of Maker Core, with token voting, delegates that are coordinated with forum and discord discussions. The most important thing that MetaDAO governance must deal with is onboarding and managing their internal workforce. The internal workforce of a MetaDAO is split into teams, and to enforce that teams do not grow beyond a natural team size and become black boxes with multiple sub-teams, there is a maximum team size of 7 people per team. A MetaDAO cannot be created with pre-existing teams, as its governance is determined by token holders that are unknown until the MetaDAO genesis distribution begins. Instead prospective MetaDAO teams \u201ccluster\u201d in advance of the launch of the MetaDAO. Clustering means preparing proposals and interacting with the people that considering farming the MetaDAO tokens in order to build support for the future proposals. The clustering process and pre-launch community interaction plays a crucial part in shaping the meta of the future MetaDAO, as the community both impacts which teams want to cluster to the future MetaDAO, but the teams that are clustering to a future MetaDAO also impacts which people will want to farm the tokens of the future MetaDAO. The goal is that the MetaDAO can stabilize its meta as quickly as possible following launch, and onboard one or more prospective clusters that are fully compatible and positively contribute to the stabilized meta. In general there are two types of teams: Administration Teams and Contribution Teams.  Administration Teams Administration Teams are the teams that directly interface with MetaDAO governance, make proposals, receive budgets and governance fast-track privileges. An Administration Team is led by one or more Facilitators, who use their governance privileges and budget powers through consensus. Administration Teams are comparable to the Facilitator role of Core Units, and are even comparable to Governance Facilitators as a part of their job is to run the core governance processes of the MetaDAO. Due to the small scale and flexible nature of MetaDAOs, their role also expands to community interaction and management, and taking care of gaps or opportunities, \u201cstartup-style\u201d. Initially MetaDAOs will likely be run by a single general purpose Administration Team, but as a MetaDAO scales it switches to having multiple Administration Teams that can specialize within different areas of responsibility, similar to Maker Core Units. All members of Administration Teams receive MetaDAO tokens from the MetaDAO Internal Workforce Bonus Pool.  Contribution Teams Contribution Teams are specialist teams that are funded by Administration Teams. They have less exposure to the MetaDAO Governance and don\u2019t make proposals or have governance fast-track privileges. They usually focus on more specialized work, such as development, risk or marketing, depending on the class and priorities of the MetaDAO. Contribution Teams can both work to build and improve the MetaDAO, or the MetaDAO can provide the services of their Contribution Teams to external customers, other MetaDAOs or Maker Core for a fee. The fluidity of the Contribution Teams helps increase efficiency of the overall Maker Ecosystem as it means people can work where they produce the most value, rather than just where they are onboarded. All members of Contribution Teams receive MetaDAO tokens from the MetaDAO Internal Workforce Bonus Pool, and this is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes whether something is a Contribution Team or just an ecosystem company.  Ecosystem Actors In addition to the Internal Workforce of a MetaDAO, a key resource of MetaDAOs comes from interfacing with Ecosystem Actors. Ecosystem Actors means any kind of company, person, entity or DAO that is doing business with the MetaDAO, and isn\u2019t an Administration Team or Contribution Team. A key way to determine this is whether they receive MetaDAO tokens for their work. If they don\u2019t receive MetaDAO Tokens from the Internal Workforce Bonus Pool, it\u2019s an Ecosystem Actor. Ecosystem Actors are usually highly specialized, and offer their services to multiple or all MetaDAOs, and often also Maker Core. The most common relationship is simple contracting based on a statement of work or an hourly rate. More advanced and experimental relationships can also be explored. Ecosystem Actors are paid either by an Administration Team or a Contribution Team from the MetaDAO Internal Workforce.  Arrangers Protectors interact with a specific type of Ecosystem Actor that allocates RWA collateral for them, called Arrangers. Arrangers are basically the intermediary between the decentralized world of DeFi and MetaDAOs, and the traditional financial and legal systems. Arrangers can only interact with a single Protector, and the RWA Collateral Scope Framework regulates how much risk concentration a MetaDAO can have to a single Arranger. An Arranger can provide both Cashlike Collateral and Clean Money Collateral, and a single Arranger can also have more than one Asset Manager that allocates the underlying capital in the real world financial system. Clean Money RWA Asset Managers must always have Junior Capital available at the Asset Manager level, based on requirements specificied in the RWA Collateral Scope Framework.  Plug and Play Protocols A more advanced and unique opportunity for Ecosystem Actors is to develop Plug and Play Protocols. These are open source protocol features that are able to charge a fee of some sort for usage, and are easily available for MetaDAOs to integrate into their decentralized frontends. In their source code, they have a revenue share percentage and minimum fee parameters specified, and a payment address. All fees earned by the MetaDAO from integrating the Plug and Play Protocol are then split with the Ecosystem Actor and sent to their payment address on a recurring basis. This is enforced by Maker Governance, which will penalize the MetaDAO if it fails to properly account for and pay out the revenue share it owes. This creates the conditions for a sandbox of innovation where open source developers can monetize their code without worrying about trade secrets or IP rights. All MetaDAOs can take advantage of Plug and Play Protocols, but Creators are particularly well suited to experiment with their technology.  The 6 Launch MetaDAOs If the Endgame Plan Preparation MIP is approved, Maker\u2019s entire Decentralized Workforce will begin to coordinate the preparation and execution of the Endgame Plan Launch. The main event of the Endgame Plan launch is the simultaneous or sequential launch of 6 new MetaDAOs (depending on logistics and pragmatic considerations). These 6 Launch MetaDAOs are carefully prepared with complete, high quality clusters for each of them so that they can all hit the ground running. Alongside this, 6 separate forums and discord channels will allow a community and unique meta to emerge, and allow the clusters to connect to the community. The 6 Launch MetaDAOs contain 2 MetaDAOs of each class, so that at launch there is immediately redundancy for each critical role, creating strong foundation for lasting decentralization.   2 Creators, that will onboard developers and build frontend products and on-chain features   2 Protectors that will adopt existing Arranger RWA Vaults, and build redundant, lean deal teams to underwite future arrangers and scale up Cashlike and Clean Money RWA when required   2 Governors that will onboard all the existing Maker Core Units and establish Councils and Tribunals for the most critical Scopes in the short term.    Long term MetaDAO incubation and Clustering After the Endgame Plan Launch phase, additional MetaDAOs will begin to be incubated through an autonomous smart contract system. There are no humans involved in the incubation of new MetaDAOs - everything is automated via a smart contract system called the Incubator, to ensure nothing can interfere with the new MetaDAOs status as \u201cborn-decentralized\u201d, creating optimal conditions for their meta to develop well. Clustering to these MetaDAOs occur with less organization and more competition than the 6 Launch MetaDAOs. A cooldown period will prevent MetaDAOs from onboarding Administration Teams until at least 3 months (exact TBD), so that the meta of the new MetaDAO can somewhat settle before votes occur. There will then in many cases be multiple competing clusters that will attempt  Maker Level governance roles Maker Core also has roles that are done carried out directly by companies or individuals, without going through MetaDAOs as intermediaries. All these roles have in common that none of them are elected through a general governance processes, such as MIPs, but instead they are marginally empowered by MKR holders in different ways to represent those specific voters, rather than attempt to represent the DAO itself. This provides strong minority stakeholder protections and reduces the risk of Maker level governance actors destabilising the meta.  Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs) DVCs are the most important organized governance body, and their goal is to openly organize and represent regular voters that are incentivized by their MKR token exposure to counterbalance the influence of the Decentralized Workforce and professional governance roles that are incentivized by the special payments they receive based on their role, which makes them susceptible to the Iron Law of Bureaucracy. DVCs organize broadly and generally as a loose group of voters with aligned overall values and views, and use chatrooms and forums to discuss their views. DVCs directly engage in the important high level questions in Maker Governance by organizing Subcommittees and Subcommittee meetings that cover the 11 DAO Scopes (The details of the 11 Scopes are described in the next section).  Recognized Status DVCs can become Recognized by the Governance Tribunal through a process approved by MKR voters in the Governance Scope Framework MIP and managed by the Governance Tribunal. The objective of the process is to ensure that the DVC contains real, independent MKR voters that have publicly registered some or all of their MKR stake to be aligned with their DVC, and are contributing to Maker Governance in good faith based on their incentives as MKR holders and community stakeholders. Another important is that members of the Decentralized Workforce cannot be registered to a DVC.  Benefits of Recognized Status Recognized DVCs name and logo are directly displayed in the Maker Governance frontend and ranked based on their total registered MKR support. Additionally, registered DVC Subcommittee participants can earn MKR compensation for their participation on the Subcommittees. Recognized DVCs also have the ability to call Council members, Tribunal members and Core Unit Facilitators to their Subcommittee meetings in order to gain the latest updates, advice and proposals on the specific Scope.  Requirements of Recognized Status The main operational requirement of Recognized DVCs is that they must hold quarterly Subcommittee meetings for each DAO Scope that are verified by the Governance Tribunal. The main requirement for a quarterly DVC Subcommittee meeting to become verified is that at least one publicly registered MKR holder must attend. When they are not Recognized, DVCs do not need to have any kind of internal governance structure and can operate completely informally. Recognized DVCs must formalize their internal governance structure to follow a simple majority of registered MKR, in order to be able to access the benefits outlined above. The most important role of the internal governance process is to govern who can join the DVC, and who to reject or expel, so the DVC can maintain a single coherent direction and vision. Major governance disputes inside a Recognized DVC will result in the DVC splitting into two new Recognized DVCs. Usually, the side with more registered MKR gets to keep the original name and logo, but in rare cases the Governance Tribunal might determine that the smaller group better represents the original intent of the DVC and can let it inherit the original DVC branding in order to cause less confusion for voters. Recognized DVCs must adhere to the overall scope constraints of the Endgame Plan, and the bottom line of their responsibility is to maintain the stability of the Endgame meta, cash flow incentives and complexity. Any attempt to change the meta or fundamental rules of Maker must be interpreted as a power grab attempt that aims to directly or indirectly centralize control of the protocol for the benefit of the ruling majority.  Delegates Delegates play a critical and central role in the governance of Maker, and in the Endgame Plan this reliance is further increased and used as one of the main means to engineer a stable long term meta, through the MetaDAO token farming incentives provided to MKR holders that actively delegate. While advanced users can simply delegate to a delegate contract they themselves control, regular users will tend to follow whatever the simplest and quickest option is in the user interface they are interacting with. That gives Delegates the potential to gather significant amounts of voting power, shifting the balance of power away from MKR whales and towards the major delegates. It also makes regulation of the official governance frontends that provide easy access to delegated MKR farming extremely important, and dealing with this challenge is the main objective of the Recognized Delegate system.  Recognized Status Delegates can become Recognized by the Governance Tribunal if they post an application and hold a public onboarding meeting. This is used as their independent delegate strategy, and makes them eligible for compensation based on the amount of MKR that is delegated to them and their DVC attendance, and also gives them a higher position in the official governance frontends. In addition to their independent delegate strategy, delegates can also support one or more DVC strategies. This makes it possible for voters to delegate MKR to a Recognized Delegate, but with the constraint that the delegate must vote according to the overall principles and values of a particular DVC. Recognized Delegates can freely support any DVC strategy without requiring approval, but DVCs internal governance process can reactively ban a Recognized Delegate from supporting the strategy if they consider them to vote against its values. Banning a Recognized Delegate from supporting a DVC strategy prevents them from receiving more vote delegation in support of that strategy, but doesn\u2019t remove the existing votes, and the existing votes instead effectively become a part of their independent strategy. Having additional DVC strategies increases the position of the Recognized Delegates in the official governance frontend, and as a result has a significant impact on the amount of regular voters that will delegate to a particular Recognized Delegate.  The 4 categories of delegates as they are ranked in the official governance frontend The official governance frontends categorize delegates into 3 ranks. Each rank is displayed with all of its members in randomized order, as ordering is going to be extremely impactful on the amount of incentivized voters that will delegate to a particular delegate. For this reason the Recognized Delegates that support several different DVC strategies receive better exposure since it forces them to be more objective and professional in their approach to serving the interests of their voters, and this makes them less likely to destabilize the meta.  Rank 1: Recognized Delegates supporting at least 2 DVC strategies Multi-strategy Recognized Delegates are Recognized Delegates that support at least 2 different DVC strategies. The can also support their Independent Delegate Strategy, but it doesn\u2019t count towards the requirement of supporting 2 DVC strategies. Recognized Delegates can choose as many strategies as they want, but they will have to choose which 3 that displays in the delegate overview page, as that is the maximum number it will support in order to help keep it simple for voters.  Rank 2: Recognized Delegates supporting less than 2 DVC strategies Delegates that either support just one DVC strategy, one DVC strategy plus their Independent Strategy, or only their Independent Strategy are covered by Rank 2. The reason why they are grouped below the multi-strategy Recognized Delegates is because they are at higher risk of being biased and entrenched in their specific single perspective. This is not a bad thing, but it is risky to promote the laziest incentivized to delegate to them as voters will need to be more active and aware of whether the delegate continues to vote according to their interests.  Rank 3: Unrecognized Delegates Unrecognized Delegates are any delegate contracts that have not achieved Recognized Status. They are not eligible to receive compensation and are placed at the bottom of the official governance frontend, since there is a high risk that they can be sybil attacked.  Delegation and MKR farming frontend mockup  Mockup of the delegated MKR farming frontend. Users click on a strategy icon for Recognized Delegates or directly on the delegate icon for unrecognized delegates, and can then click the top right button to delegate their MKR and begin farming MetaDAO tokens in a single transaction.  DVC Subcommittee attendance Recognized Delegates become eligible to earn compensation based on MKR delegated to them, but they must also attend DVC Subcommittee meetings in order to receive the compensation. The hours of attendance required increases as they become eligible for higher compensation, with the maximum achievable compensation corresponding to a DVC Subcommittee meeting attendance equivalent to a full time job (also assuming that delegate spends time on preparation and office hours in addition to the actual attendance). Similar to supporting a DVC Strategy, Delegates can also be banned from attending DVC Subcommittee meetings if they are simply abusing it to unlock the compensation and not actively contributing.  Budget Allocators Budget Allocators are an optional role that provides a powerful and flexible tool useable both in Maker Governance and in MetaDAO Governance to allow marginal voters to impact budget allocation, providing minority voter protection and preventing tyranny of the majority, which helps promote a more stable meta. To activate Budget Allocators, the technical system must first be built, and once built must be provided with an Allocated Budget through a MIP, which can be both fixed (e.g. 30 million USD equivalent per year) or relative (e.g. 50% of all surplus up to 50 million USD equivalent per year). Companies and individuals can then sign up as Budget Allocators, and this allows them to received delegated Budget Power in the same way Delegates receive voting power. Budget Power comes from MKR just like voting, but can be split off by the voter if they want to. Otherwise it can be passed on to the delegates alongside the voting power, who can then delegate it further to the Budget Allocators. The Budget Allocators split the total Allocated Budget amongst them proportionally based on their relative Budget Power. They receive it into their non-custodial Budget Allocator accounts, and can then either pass it on in a continuous streaming fashion, or in lump sum payments to Core Units and Tribunals. The technical system for Budget Allocators prevents Budget Allocators from sending budget anywhere other than to Core Units and Tribunals approved by Maker Governance, making embezzlement or accidentally losing the budgets impossible. Maker Governance can also freeze the Budget Allocator system at any time, and clawback funds from Budget Allocators (monitored and advised by the Finance and Ecosystem Tribunals) in the same way they can clawback funds from Core Units and Tribunals.  Recognized Status Budget Allocators can achieve Recognized Status similar to Delegates by verifying that they are independent individuals through a process managed by the Governance Tribunal, that involves writing a public information sheet, and holding a public Q&A meeting open to the community. Recognized Budget Allocators become eligible for compensation, and are prioritized in the Budget Allocator frontend, but must post continuous updates and transparency reports. They are compensated based a % of the budget power that flows through them, incentivizing individual Budget Allocators to strive for competition and outperformance in terms of results and impacts of the budget they direct.  The Scopes The Scopes are 11 focus areas of Maker Governance that together encompass the entire universe of complexity of valid Maker Governance decisions. Their chief objective is to create a rigid structure that prevents scope creep or drift over time, while also ensuring that none of the critical functions necessary for Maker Core to survive long term are ever neglected, or are not easily accessible or understood by regular MKR governance participants. Each Scope is governed at the highest level by a MIP called a Scope Framework, which is continuously edited through a ratification process where Maker Governance votes on new versions based on input from all relevant experts and stakeholders, curated by the Councils and Tribunals, run by the Governors. The scopes are segmented into two broad categories:   The 4 Primary Scopes are direct business focused scopes that handle the most critical day to day operations of the protocol. They have high budgets, and multiple redundant Core Units provided by different Governors that each control a piece of the overall budget and governance fast track privileges. There is strong balance of power where Councils are the ones tasked with researching and updating the Scope Frameworks, while the Core Units have to operate by interpreting and following the Scope Frameworks.  The 7 Supporting Scopes are \u201cbackend\u201d functions of the DAO that are necessary for the ecosystem to thrive and function properly in the long run. They have lower budgets, and are controlled by singular Tribunals that all Governors participate in.   Unified Coordination Toolkit (UCT) It is critical that the Decentralized Workforce of Maker Core only use fully transparent and decentralized processes for all operations and decision making.  The primary method used to enable this is the UCT, a single open source software system that simultaneously works as a transparency and governance reporting tool, while also functioning as a collaboration tool. It is best comparable to github but for operations, and is both used by contributors to directly collaborate on work using streamlined and standardized transparent processes. At the same time it is also used by Maker Governance and MKR holders to oversee and understand the progress, results and risks of the tasks being undertaken by the Decentralized Workforce, and the information that they are sharing. The UCT also synergizes well with the Decentralized Frontend as it can be bundled as a standard feature alongside other governance related components. The Council or Tribunal of each Scope is responsible for designing the UCT module for their respective Scope. The UCT module is how the Scope Framework is practically turned into processes that the Core Units and Tribunals can then follow.  Primary Scopes  Decentralized Collateral Decentralized Collateral covers the processes related to management and onboarding of decentralized collateral.  Top down parameter adjustment Top down parameter adjustment is the process used to change risk parameters such as stability fees and debt ceiling of decentralized collateral vault types. It is done at regular intervals, and in special cases done reactively, such as due to hitting the debt ceiling or emerging external factors. The research, data collection, processing and recommendations provided are done according to the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework. The process both covers standard vaults directly used by end users, but another highly scalable and impactful aspect of the top down parameter adjustment process is that it modifies the parameters of Vault Adoption or D3M connections to Creators.  Top down collateral onboarding Top down collateral onboarding covers cases where Core Unit Facilitators follow the Scope Framework to prioritize new collateral types based on research and data collection, and then use budget to fund the onboarding work of new collateral types.  Bottom up collateral onboarding The bottom up collateral onboarding process is based on a Revenue Share Bounty Plan that is specified in the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework. It incentivizes MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors to take the initiative on developing and deploying new collateral onboarding code, and then bring it to Maker Governance for approval. If a bottom up collateral onboarding is approved, the proposer will then earn a revenue share from the net stability fees generated from the collateral type according to the Revenue Share Bounty Plan. The review process and how to determine whether to reject or approve a bottom up collateral onboarding is also specificed in the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework.  RWA Collateral  Top down parameter adjustment The top down parameter adjustment process overs the process of managing risk related to Real World Asset collateral exposure. The RWA Collateral Scope Framework specifies the process used to analyze and modify Vault Adoption or D3M parameters to Protectors, and parameter adjustments of PSMs. These process takes into account several sub frameworks that covers financial risk, physical threat risk and sustainability.  Top down collateral onboarding The top down collateral onboarding process for RWAs covers specifically the onboarding of new PSMs. This works identically to the top down collateral onboardig process for decentralized collateral, and taps into the same supply chain.  Protocol Engineering  Top down product development and upgrades Protocol Features prioritizes and funds the research, development and deployment of the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap, as well as ongoing major feature upgrades, such as security upgrades, gas efficiency refactoring and governance submodules such as IAMs. The protocol feature scope is responsible for preventing scope creep and complexity growth beyond the boundaries of the Endgame Plan. In very rare cases it will be possible to add additional complexity, but only if it fits cleanly together with the holistic view of the Endgame Plan is in effect a missing feature. To do so will require very rigorous research and broad community consensus.  Top down protocol expansion In the long run the main focus of the Protocol Features scope is the deployment of new major building blocks across the L2 ecosystem or on the Ethereum Mainnet. This includes Sharded Vault Engines/Singularity Engines, new Maker Teleport building blocks, and new Synthetic Assets. It is also responsible for expanding certain backend features such Multichain Elixir and Meta Elixir (explained later).  Bottom up protocol expansion The bottom up protocol expansion process is based on a Revenue Share Bounty Plan that is specified in the Protocol Features Scope Framework. It incentivizes MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors to take the initiative on developing and deploying new Sharded Vault Engine, Maker Teleport and Synthetic Assets code, and then bring it to Maker Governance for approval. If a bottom up protocol expansion is approved, the proposer will then earn a revenue share from the net stability fees generated from the collateral type according to the Revenue Share Bounty Plan. The review process and how to determine whether to reject or approve a bottom up protocol expansion is also specified in the Protocol Features Scope Framework.  Protocol Security The Protocol Engineering Scope is responsible for funding continuous audits and security research into the deployed Maker Protocol. It is also responsible for funding and operating smart contract bug bounty programs.  Growth The growth scope focuses on developing the Maker and Dai brand, and allocate budget to fund various growth and marketing initiatives. It is also responsible for maintaining the official MakerDAO website design, and design and branding guidelines for MetaDAO frontends.  Supporting Scopes  Finance The Finance scope builds the financial reporting processes and systems for the UCT, and provide regular comprehensive updates and overviews of the overall state of the protocols financial situation.  Stability and Liquidity  Cashlike RWA portfolio management Stability and Liquidity is responsible for updating and implementing a framework for the Cashlike RWA portfolio of assets, in order to ensure that it balances optimal yield generation with enough liquidity to keep Dai fully useable as a currency.  Target Rate management After Dai becomes free floating the Stability and Liquidity scope must monitor and research upgrades to the Target Rate algorithm, and in the long run when no external value reference can be relied upon, the scope expands significantly and also engages in aggregating CPI data in order to measure and target inflation rates of Dai.  Protocol Owned Vault management The Stability and Liquidity Scope is also responsible for providing advice related to the management of the Protocol Owned Vault, using it for optimal benefit for maintaining Dai stability and market confidence. Risk management related research is done by relying on the supply chain of Decentralized Collateral.  Legal Research The Legal Research Supporting Scope focuses on the broad legal and regulatory impacts on Maker Core and the Decentralized Workforce in the broader ecosystem.  legal risk monitoring Legal Research defines best practice around avoiding legal risk in the Legal Research Scope Framework, and continuously monitors the activity of the Decentralized Workforce, the MetaDAOs and the Ecosystem Actors to detect risk. In case activity is detected that could result in e.g. a regulatory backlash or legal liability, it may propose reactive measures to Maker Governance.  External physical threat monitoring Legal Research continuously researches and monitors the possibility of a severe external physical threat, such as a regulatory crackdown or legislative changes that could create considerable risk for Maker\u2019s RWA collateral. In the worst case scenario, the Legal Research Tribunal must advice Maker to activate Phoenix Stance as a reactive measure.  Infrastructure Infrastructure and security details the overall security requirements of the most critical infrastructure of the Maker Protocol including the smart contract protocol itself, the keepers, oracles and other Node Network related infrastructure necessary for the Maker Protocol to function. It is responsible for choosing and funding MetaDAOs that provide Oracle Guarantee services. It is also responsible for funding bug bounty and similar security focused programs.  Interface The Interface Scope focuses on the regulation and development of the core elements of the Decentralized Frontend. This includes ensuring that a fully functional and secure decentralized frontend codebase is available that covers:  DSR Vaults MetaDAO farms Governance Auctions Chat Forum Unified Coordination Toolkit  The work to build all of these features into accessible and easily shareable decentralized frontends will take a long time, and different features will be prioritized at different  Ecosystem  Governance process The Ecosystem Scope operates the governance processes of Maker Core, including MIPs and MIP-derived processes  Governance communications The Ecosystem Scope operates the governance and community communication platforms, and provides easy to access information about the governance process  MetaDAO monitoring The Ecosystem Scope monitors the general business practices of the MetaDAOs and proposes reactive measures of a breach of best practices or other malpractice is discovered. It also maintains a framework for MetaDAO penalties as a part of the Ecosystem Scope Framework.  MetaDAO agreement enforcement The Ecosystem Scope interprets and proposes actions to Maker Governance that follow governance agreements or settle disputes between MetaDAOs or Ecosystem Actors. For example, the Ecosystem Scope is responsible for paying out the Maker Vault Stability Fee Frontend Revenue Share to MetaDAOs that have complied with best practice in their Decentralized Frontends, including determining who is eligible. It is also responsible for enforcing the revenue share agreements of Plut and Play Protocol features adopted by MetaDAOs.  Governance  Final arbitration The Governance Tribunal is responsible for providing final arbitration on metagovernance disputes, including decisions by the Ecosystem Tribunal that have been escalated, and disputes or risks related to Delegate compensation or Decentralized Voter Committee Compensation. The Governance Scope Framework tries to cover as many edge cases in advance as possible, however in practice disputes that are escalated to the Governance Tribunal are likely to not have any precedents.  Governance frontend regulation The Governance Scope Framework determines the requirements for Decentralized Voter Committee inclusion and ranking in the Governance frontends.  Recognized Delegate and Recognized Budget Allocator program The Governance Tribunal operates the process with which Delegates and Budget Allocators can achieved Recognized status and become eligible for compensation.

                    "content": " Endgame Plan Product Roadmap The Endgame Plan Product Roadmap contains the complete and finite list of all features that will be developed and implemented as a part of the Endgame Plan rollout. Their completion marks a crucial step in achieving a stable and reliable Endgame State as it will mean no more technical complexity or feature expansion of the protocol, beyond the specific and limited expansion processes detailed in the Scopes. The Endgame Plan Product Roadmap is broken into 4 major phases: Pregame, Early Game, Midgame and Endgame. Rather than try to follow a rigid roadmap this allows the community to prioritize the products that are best fit for the current conditions, but still follow an overall high level reliable roadmap.  endgameplanroad931\u00d7288 23.9 KB  The different products and stages of each products are described in their corresponding phase. In most cases, all products of an existing phase must be finished before the community can move on to begin development of the next phase. As a part of the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap, the Endgame Plan Metanomics are also described, and broken down into the different stages it will be implemented in. Additionally, in the following section there is as full tokenomics review of the Metanomics system that focuses on providing a holistic view of all the tokenomics flows and how they interact.  Pregame The Pregame Phase is the first phase of Endgame Plan Product development, which focuses on preparing the features that are on the critical path to launching the 6 Launch MetaDAOs in the event called the Endgame Plan Launch. All of the features in the Pregame Phase must be developed and then the Endgame Plan Launch can be triggerered.  Overview  Endgame Plan Approval MIP EtherDai I Elixir I MetaDAO tokens MetaDAO farms Meta Elixir I Metanomics I Anti Reflexivity Mechanic Simple offchain voting Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set   Endgame Plan Approval MIP The Endgame Plan Approval MIP is the first step towards implementating the Endgame Plan. It first and foremost determines whether there is MKR voter support for the Endgame Plan, and if passed signals the commitment of Maker Governance to launch a version of the Endgame Plan and to launc the 6 launch MetaDAOs  Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters It designates 6 Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters, that are each attached to an existing Core Unit. These 6 Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters receive governance approval as the MetaDAO clusters that will be available for token holders of the 6 Launch MetaDAOs to onboard after the Endgame Plan Launch, and gives them various privileges. These privileges are in practice controlled by the Facilitator of the Core Unit that the clusters are attached to, but must be controlled according to the views of the cluster as interpreted by the Facilitator, in order to maximally set up the cluster for success after onboarding to the Launch MetaDAOs.  Creator and Protector cluster collateral onboarding authority There are two clusters corresponding to each MetaDAO class. The Creator Clusters take over the responsibility of decentralized collateral onboarding and Protector clusters take over the responsibility of collateral onboarding responsibilities, and each receive a preliminary Vault Adoption Debt Ceiling of 250 million Dai. The vaults are still considered Maker Core Vaults, and all stability fees will continue to go to Maker Core. After the Endgame Plan Launch the vaults will then have to be formally adopted by the MetaDAOs following the Vault Adoption system when it is ready.  Collateral onboarding process replacement and collateral application rejection The Endgame Approval MIP replaces the existing collateral onboarding process, and rejects all active collateral applications. Instead, most collateral onboarding must go through the collateral onboarding privileges of the Recognized MetaDAO Clusters described, including all RWA and altcoins. By default it will be a top down process only, and there will be no formal application process available at the Maker level. A bottom up collateral onboarding process will only exist if the clusters choose to define and manage one themselves and follow it fully or partially using their top down collateral onboarding authority, however they are not bound to do so and have full autonomy on how they want to use this authority.  Continued Maker Core collateral onboarding of ETH, Stablecoins and D3Ms The Risk Core Unit will also have the authority to prioritize and onboard major, scalable collateral types  including:  ETH, or ETH related assets such as Staked ETH or ETH/DAI LP tokens stablecoin PSMs or stablecoin related collateral such as USDC/DAI LP tokens D3Ms   Preliminary Protocol Owned Vault activation The Endgame Approval MIP also immediately activates the Protocol Owned Vault through a Protocol Owned Vault Emulation, authorizing the immediate start to a manually executed Staked ETH accumulation strategy. Protocol Owned Vault Emulation is not implementing through any new smart contracts, but is instead executed by taking advantage of the ability for Maker Governance to set the Surplus Buffer to go negative, and the ability of the Pause Proxy to hold governance controlled assets. Initially, 40 million Dai from the Surplus Buffer will be used, and will immediately begin acquiring Staked ETH at 2x leverage with a paced dollar cost averaging process. This means in practice 80 million Dai will be spent from the Surplus Buffer to acquire Staked ETH into the Pause Proxy, and its lower limit will be set to -40 million. Additional surplus earned will also be put into the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation and manually used to acquire more Staked ETH. The reason why the Endgame Plan aims to immediately begin accumulating Staked ETH is so that the actual pace of accumulation can be made slower, in order to prevent too much slippage and frontrunning from occuring, as well as to begin the dollar cost average accumulation as soon as possible following the Merge.  ETHD I: EtherDai EtherDai is the central user facing product of the entire Endgame Plan, as all other mechanisms and incentives aim to drive users towards EtherDai Vaults. ETHD I is the Pregame implementation of EtherDai, and uses a \u201cshortcut\u201d approach in order to quickly bootstrap the product rather than implement the full, long run scope of the product. The goal is to have a staked ETH token under the control of Maker governance, that can ultimately be upgraded to become a fully fledged synthetic asset which will provide many additional benefits and greater utility to users and the Maker protocol. ETHD I is implemented through a simple ERC20 token wrapper around Lido\u2019s Staked ETH. The ERC20 token wrapper allows users to take STETH and wrap it into ETHD, or take ETHD and unwrap it into STETH. Maker Governance has backdoor access to the ETHD collateral, as well as the ability to set permissions for minting and burning of ETHD. This allows Maker Governance to eventually upgrade ETHD to it\u2019s full Synthetic Asset form in the Midgame. Before this upgrade occurs, ETHD will be a very valuable and useful product that can easily generate network effects, as it piggybacks on Lidos best in class security, liquidity and efficiency. EtherDai must also be onboarded as Maker Vaults, possibly with multiple different options for risk parameters, or just with the same risk parameters as Steth. In order to facilitate large amounts of Dai generated from EtherDai vaults, the liquidity of EtherDai will need to be boosted with captive liquidity. This is initially done using short term yield farming of ETHD/DAI on uniswap (Explained later). This short term captive liquidity will be replaced by long term liquidity provided through Elixir accumulation (Explained later). EtherDai and the EtherDai Vaults are the only pregame products that can be launched before everything else, and their development and release should be the very first priority of the entire Endgame Plan. Before the other systems are in place, demand for EtherDai vaults can be bootstrapped by providing them with a temporary stability fee of 0%. This will build up a userbase that can later be monetized when Stability Fees and MetaDAO farms are activated.  Elixir I Elixir is the universal long term liquidity solution for Dai, ETHD and MKR in the Endgame Plan. Eventually, it is used to automatically provide sustainable, captive liquidity on all key decentralized marketplaces, and across all important L2s and L1s without needing manual intervention or short term incentives. The Pregame iteration of Elixir, Elixir I, is a simple Balancer pool that consists of 1/3rd Dai, 1/3rd ETHD and 1/3rd MKR. During the Early Game Elixir I is accumulated by MetaDAOs by selling their MetaDAO tokens using the Anti-Rush Mechanic (Explained later).  MetaDAO Tokens MetaDAO Tokens are simple ERC20 tokens that are controlled by the Maker Pause Proxy. Their initial supply is 4.6 billion (For long term MetaDAOs beyond the 6 Launch MetaDAOs this is 4.5 billion). The tokens are emitted alongside the deployment of the ERC20 token smart contracts, and sent to a Maker Governance account, from where they are distributed to the MetaDAO farms, MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pools, and MetaDAO Treasury Funding Accounts Once the MetaDAO Permanent Emissions System is ready for deployment in the Midgame, the ability to Mint and Burn MetaDAO tokens is authorized to those systems. The initial 6 Launch MetaDAO tokens are manually created. Starting with the 7th MetaDAO the tokens and all other aspects of the new MetaDAOs are created automatically by the Incubator (Explained in Midgame Products).  MetaDAO farms 2 billion MetaDAO tokens are sent to the MetaDAO farms to be farmed by Dai holders, ETHD Vault users and MKR governance participants over a period of 10 years. The farming schedule is 1 billion the first 2 years, 500 million the following 2 years, 250 million the following 2 years, and then the remaining 250 million the last 4 years.  MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pools 400 million MetaDAO tokens are sent to the MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pools, where they are controlled by MetaDAO token governance to provide attractive bonus incentives for the bootstrapping clusters. The long term MetaDAOs receive only 300 million MetaDAO tokens into the MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pool, but the 6 launch MetaDAOs are provided an additional 100 million to help facilitate the Endgame Plan Launch.  MetaDAO Treasury Funding Account 200 million MetaDAO tokens are sent to the MetaDAO Treasury Funding Account. From there they are automatically sold for Dai (by first selling to MKR via Meta Elixir, and then to Dai via Elixir) over a period of 2 years.  MetaDAO farms 3 types of farms for each of the 6 Launch MetaDAOs must be deployed during the pregame phase, before the Endgame Plan Launch can occur.  Dai farms The Dai farms are just simple ERC20 farms that distribute MetaDAO tokens. During the first year following the Endgame Plan Launch 100 million MetaDAO tokens of each MetaDAO is distributed through the Dai farms.  ETHD Vault Debt farms The ETHD Vault Debt farms are more advanced than regular farms. They require the user to first open a specific type of ETHD Vault with the Maker Protocol and then deposit the Vault into the farm. They then farm the MetaDAO tokens based on the amount of Dai debt in their vault. During the first year following the Endgame Plan Launch 200 million MetaDAO tokens of each MetaDAO is distributed through the ETHD Vault Debt farms.  Delegated MKR farms The delegated MKR farms require the user to transfer MKR that is actively delegated into the farm, in order to farm MetaDAO tokens based on the amount of MKR they have. MKR that is not actively delegating to a delegate (of any type, which can include their own delegate contract), cannot be used to farm with.  MetaDAO frontend The MetaDAO frontend is a frontend that exposes the MetaDAO farms, and can be developed further by the MetaDAOs to expose more features such as Dai Savings Rate, Dai MetaDAO farming, Maker Vaults, Maker Governance interface and more. To enable the Endgame Plan Launch, only the MetaDAO farms need to be available as the other features can be added later. It is still likely that at least some of the additional features will be developed and ready to launch alongside the Endgame Plan Launch.  Meta Elixir I Meta Elixir is the core liquidity pool for MetaDAO tokens against MKR. Like Elixir, the goal is to be able to use Meta Elixir as the main source of cross-market and cross-chain MetaDAO token liquidity. It also helps establish MKR as the main trading currency for MetaDAO tokens across all markets. Meta Elixir I is a simplified version that is implemented through a simple Uniswap pool token of MetaDAO tokens paired against MKR. The fundamental driver of the value flows of Metanomics is the permanent emissions of MKR that is used to accumulate Meta Elixir. During the Endgame Plan Launch, before the 7th MetaDAO is launched, Maker will, for each MetaDAO, emit 7500 MKR per year to accumulate Meta Elixir.  Metanomics I Metanomics is the core tokenomics system of the Endgame Plan. It works by emitting 50000 MKR per year and distributing it towards Meta Elixir Acquisition, MetaDAO Incubation, and the Maker Workforce Bonus Pool.  Meta Elixir Acquisition 45000 of the yearly Metanomics emissions are used to accumulate Meta Elixir of each MetaDAO. For the 6 Launch MetaDAOs during the Endgame Plan Launch, this results in 7500 MKR accumulated for each MetaDAO. Following the launch of the 7th MetaDAO, the Meta Elixir accumulation for each MetaDAO is automatically adjusted based on the amount of Elixir each MetaDAO has accumulated in their burn engines. (Further explained in Metanomics II)  MetaDAO Incubation and Maker Workforce Bonus Pool split The remaining 5000 MKR per year is split between being funneled to the Incubator, where it is converted to Elixir, or being funneled to the Maker Workforce Bonus Pool where it is used to pay for long term bonuses for Delegates, Council Members, Facilitators and Tribunal Members. Maker Governance determines the ratio of the split, but the amount of MKR funnneled to the Workforce Bonus Pool cannot exceed 2000 MKR per year.  Anti Reflexivity Mechanic The Anti Reflexivity Mechanic is a simple system used by Maker at the Endgame Plan Launch, and by all new MetaDAOs, including the 6 Launch MetaDAOs at the Endgame Plan Launch. The system consists of a limit order staircase that sells a fixed amount of MKR or MetaDAO tokens for Dai at fixed prices. The earned Dai is then converted to Elixir and accumulated in the Burn Engines of Maker or the MetaDAOs. It prevents overly volatile price action caused by the Metanomics when new MetaDAOs are launched and circulating supply is very low.  MKR Anti Reflexivity Mechanic at Endgame Plan Launch At the Endgame Plan Launch, all MKR that remains in the MKR reserve that is not sent to the Workforce Bonus Pool is used to set up an Anti Reflexivity Mechanic with limit orders on an external DEX. The lowest step is set at the MKR price near the market price at the Endgame Plan Launch, and the upper steps are determined by Maker Governance in advance.  Anti Reflexivity Mechanic at MetaDAO Genesis When a new MetaDAO is launched, 4.5 billion MetaDAO tokens are immediately emitted. 2 billion of those tokens are used to fund an Anti Reflexivity Mechanic with limit orders on an external DEX. The limit order staircase has 100 limit orders of 20 million MDAO each with the lowest limit order starting at 0.01 DAI per MDAO, and each additional limit order placed at 0.001 higher increments, until the final limit order at 0.109 DAI per MDAO.  Simple offchain voting One of the only technical requirements necessary for MetaDAO governance to function, is the existence of a simple, offchain and gasless polling system that will allow MetaDAO token holders to vote in non binding polls that Maker Governance can then interpret and execute. The simplest form of this system, which would be enough to meet the requirement for Endgame Plan Launch would be to directly use snapshot.org polls with no additional configuration or development needed. However, it is possible that an adaptation of the Maker rollup based voting system could be available in time, which would provide a more secure gasless voting solution that also supports delegation (an Early Game Feature)  Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set When all the other pieces of the Pregame are ready, the last thing necessary to actually trigger the Endgame Plan Launch is the Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set. It is a MIP Set of multiple interdependent MIPs that together implement the Endgame Launch. The MIPs in the MIP Set play fundamental governance roles similar to MIP0 and MIP1 by defining fundamental rules of governance that will be binding on all future MIPs. Alongside these core rules are also many specific decisions and specifications that help maximally define the Endgame Plan Launch and promote ossification and minimize confusion and uncertainty and the ability to switch directions or make fundamental changes to governance.  Purpose and Values The MIP Set will contain MIPs that establish a social contract in the community enshrining values such as  Clean Money, that will later be directly implemented through RWA allocation frameworks and MetaDAO tokenomics. The MIPs will also spell the intangible value that the community expects to gain from following the purpose and values, in order to ensure the community will better be able to align in the long term on the fundamental logic of why the purpose and values exist, rather than just seeing them as some boxes to check.  Immutable Metanomics The MIP Set will contain a MIP that defines the permanent and completely immutable tokenomics schedules for the Metanomics that applies to both MKR and MetaDAO tokens. These token emission and distribution schedules should be impossible to change after the fact, in order to provide complete certainty around long term token supply and distribution, and prevent power struggles related to control of token emissions.  Constitution The MIP Set will contain a constitution that defines what aspects of governance processes are immutable and should change minimally, as well as fundamental expectation of different governance participants, including voters and the decentralized workforce. It will particular spell out neutrality requirements for different Decentralized Workforce participants, and explain the reasoning and the risks involved if neutrality isn\u2019t upheld, in order to maximize the likelihood that voters in the long run will choose to enforce the constitution through their understanding of how exactly it benefits them to do so.  Endgame Plan Product Roadmap specification MIPs A MIP for each of the Endgame Plan products provides as much clarity as possible around their implementation and requirements. Creator Quest payouts will directly rely on these product specification MIPs, in order to maximize their potential for ossification and minimize the chance that the product roadmap will randomly change or become sources of power struggles. The Endgame Plan Launch MIP Set is implemented entirely through MIPs, meaning it is purely governance proposal text and has no technical component to it, and requires no technical resources.  Endgame Plan Launch is triggered and the 6 Launch MetaDAOs are created  pregametoearlygame1435\u00d7953 107 KB   Early Game During the Early Game several useful features that can be developed in the short run are built as a fast-follow to the Endgame Plan Launch  Incubator The Incubator is a system that permanently, automatically without human intervention periodically creates new MetaDAOs at a variable frequency. It automatically deploys the ERC20 token and all other core components and sets up all relevant smart contracts and permissions through smart contract factories. It also accumulates Elixir over time from Metanomics, and automatically transfers all accumulated Elixir to the next MetaDAO to seed it with value. The Incubator follows simple algorithms to determine the class of the next MetaDAO, and the incubation period for new MetaDAOs. The rules apply to the next MetaDAO that is being incubated, so even if conditions change the current MetaDAO that is being incubated will follow the same parameters that were determined when it started incubating and then when it launches, the following MetaDAO that begins incubating will have its class and incubation period determined by the rules at that moment in time.  MetaDAO Class Algorithm  If there are less than 2 Governors, incubate a Governor If there are more than 10 MetaDAOs and less than 3 Governors, incubate a Governor If less than 10% of all MetaDAOs are Governors, incubate a Governor If less than 25% of all MetaDAOs are Protectors, incubate a Protector Else incubate a Creator   MetaDAO Incubation Period Algorithm  If there are less than 20 MetaDAOs, the incubation period is 1 year If there are equal to or more than 20 MetaDAOs, the incubation period is 1 year per 10 MetaDAOs (rounded down) If there are more than 100 MetaDAOs the incubation period is 10 years   MKR Vaults MKR Vaults are a simple and very useful feature that provides much greater utility to MKR, while also boosting the percentage of Dai that is backed by decentralized collateral. MKR Vaults can only be used with MKR that is actively farming MetaDAOs, and consequently is actively delegating.  Maker Teleport Maker Teleport is a useful feature that allows users to instantly transfer Dai from the Ethereum Mainnet to L2\u2019s, or from one L2 to another L2, without a delay or commitment period.  Maker Sharded Vault Engines The Maker Sharded Vault Engines will initially be deployed on Optimism, Arbitrum and Starknet, and will help lower the barrier to entry for vault users and make Dai a much more L2 native asset. The Maker Sharded Vault Engines will also enable the Homebase system for Creators, allowing Maker to more effectively connect with the emerging economies and communities on L2s.  Multichain MetaDAO farms The Multichain MetaDAO farms is an important tool for boosting Dai and Maker Vault adoption across L2\u2019s, and should be deployed alongside the Sharded Vault Engines in order to immediately drive users to them.  Multichain Dai Savings Rate The Multichain Dai Savings Rate also helps drive L2 adoption of Dai.  Metanomics II Metanomics II changes the Metanomics so that the Meta Elixir Accumulation is now done based on the proportional weight of Elixir controlled by each MetaDAO.  Midgame In the Midgame phase the more advanced and strong features are developed to set Maker up for long term success.  Long Term MetaDAO Tokenomics The Long Term MetaDAO Tokenomics is a MetaDAO token emissions schedule that will apply to all existing MetaDAOs and all future MetaDAOs from their genesis. Unlike the Metanomics of MKR which are fixed amounts, meaning that the emissions themselves eventually dilute their own impact in relative terms, the MetaDAO Tokenomics are denominated in percentages of total circulating supply. Total circulating supply is the total supply minus genesis MetaDAO tokens that have not yet been farmed and MetaDAO tokens that remain in the Anti Reflexivity Mechanic.  The Long Term MetaDAO Tokenomics emissions schedule  5% of tokens to MetaDAO NFT staking 3% of tokens to MetaDAO Farms 1% of tokens to MetaDAO Workforce Bonus Pool 1% of tokens to MetaDAO Drizzle (Unless Drizzle already contains more than 10% of total supply)   MetaDAO NFT Staking MetaDAO NFT Staking is a staking system that enables MetaDAO token holders to stake their MetaDAO tokens by turning them into a locked NFT. While in NFT Staking, the amount of MetaDAO tokens that the NFT can be exchanged to increases over time due to the MetaDAO Tokenomics Emissions of 5% per year  Ember Burn Engine Ember Burn Engine is a burn engine that accumulates Elixir as \u201cdry powder\u201d and uses a valuation algorithm to deploy the Elixir to burn MKR or MDAO tokens when the market price is low.  Valuation Algorithm for MKR The Valuation Algorithm for MKR is 2x internal capital. The burn engine burns a percentage of its elixir based on the deviation below 2x internal capital, meaning that at 1x internal capital the burn engine will burn 100% of its Elixir per year.  Valuation Algorithm for MetaDAOs The Valuation Algorithm for MetaDAOs is deliberately restricted in order to make them vehicles for long term Elixir accumulation, and allow them to benefit as much as possible from the Metanomics. The valuation algorithm is 1x accumulated Elixir. If the market cap of the MetaDAO tokens fall below the total amount of Elixir accumulated in the Ember Burn Engine, the burn engine begins to burn at fixed rate of 0.5% of its Elixir per month.  Drizzle Engine The Drizzle Engine is a reverse Ember Burn Engine that accumulates MKR and MetaDAO tokens, and sells them for Elixir that it sends to the Ember Burn Engine when the MKR or MDAO price is above its valuation model.  Singularity Engine The Singularity Engine is an integrated Vault, Synthetic Asset, DEX and Farming Engine, optimized for gas efficiency.  Root Engine The Root Engine is a Singularity Engine that also contains the Maker Governance Functionality, and the ability for MKR holders to create Governance Lockup Vaults, which gives them benefits in exchange for locking their MKR behind a short unlock period and an exit fee.  Endgame Products  Maker Rollup Based on the Oracle Network  Maker Staking Network Based on the Oracle Network  Singularity Engine II The Singularity Engine II enables MetaDAOs to control their own vault engines that are fully integrated into the Maker Singularity Engines, allowing maximum integration gains and efficiency gains from everything being integrated with a single native DEX. It also supports NFT farming which allows MetaDAO farms to directly farm MetaDAO tokens that are NFT Staking into a single NFT.  Root Engine II Root Engine II is the Governance version of Singularity Engine II  Metanomics value flowchart overview  updated_metanomics1375\u00d71556 334 KB   Draft version - there will be more edits and changes ",

Shouldn\u2019t there be incentives for collaboration and cooperation? Metadaos need to be dynamic with exemplary leadership, a credible plan, and understandable tokenomics. Lacking those fundamentals is setting them up for failure. How do we ensure everyone interprets the information and context of the plan as intended? How can we iterate to make this better?
