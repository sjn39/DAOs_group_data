                    "content": "This is a forum post to gauge how Maker forum users would feel about allocating funds for development of a small set of tools for the purpose of making the system more understandable for the average user. One idea for the first thing we could make is a simple user interface that provides consistent terminology and verified math functions for interacting with the Dai and Rai systems. One example of this problem is if a UI incorrectly projects the per-second interest rate, especially with multiple interacting rates, the user might make trades off of incorrect information, which is not much different from a UI sending tokens to the wrong address. This user interface should be focused on consistency, correctness, and ease of auditability. Instead of treating regular users like they need flashy interfaces to attract them, we should just show them the system as it is, and let them learn how it actually works. Think of etherscan \u2013 it tries to show you \u201ceverything\u201d, and it is not very opinionated in the \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the information. In my experience a surprising number of people agree that something like defisaver or even the etherscan contract write interface is, unfortunately, the best user interface for many defi systems. These systems are simple enough that we should auto-generated verifiable user interfaces at least that good that are permanently hashed on-chain. We should start with something like that, and then augment it with more information, and maybe move some things into an \u201cadvanced\u201d tab. Treating users like they need to be guided towards particular use cases will ultimately make the product worse, because even if most users don\u2019t use most features, some users need access to each feature at some point \u2013 otherwise they wouldn\u2019t exist! This applies to all components of the system \u2013 CDPs, voting, and \u201c3rd party\u201d analysis, like when people make decisions partially based on Maker system state without necessarily having a position. The fact is that most people have an incorrect understanding of almost every part of the system, and most parts are not being used correctly (for example, both on-chain actions and oracles are selected via an indirect process and not the built-in voting system as designed, and users might not fully understand the implications of these designs for their positions, if they are obfuscated). For this project, I think an appropriate budget would be two part-time developers. I think it makes sense for at least one to be an existing developer at Maker who has context on the latest contract system state. I have a very clear idea of how to make a very small and simple interface that should expose all the information, I just need help putting in the hours. If there is not enough interest here in the Maker project, I think it still makes sense for us to do this, but we will not be able to get it done as fast, and honestly we would probably make the branding more oriented around my new projects rather than a more neutral \u201cexplorer\u201d look. Looking forward to your feedback about the concept of an Understandability Initiative for Maker. ",

We have been creating educational content for the past few months as well as creating an online academy where people could go to learn. In addition to showing our own content, we will show content that SES is making and PECU is making. One of our projects is redesigning Maker into python so that it is more friendly for users to test and play around with. We are also beefing up the documentation. Your idea sounds very good and interesting. It would be great if we could set up a meeting and collaborate on your idea. Please reach out.
