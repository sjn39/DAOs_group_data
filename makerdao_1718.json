                    "content": "Good day MakerDAO. I know Maker has a lot on its plate \u2018EndGame\u2019 and all but I have been thinking about this for a long time simplifying my view and position and my analysis suggests path forward for Maker is pretty clear for multiple reasons. Integrated with Maker genetics at conception is an idea to build a better financial world that includes some key premises.  Fugability of capital Strong and secure capitalization of DAI Decentralization and financial Anti-fragility Some concept of a stable value for an permissionless DAI  My take here is that permissionless DAI is in effect pirate money.   For all intensive purposes the Maker protocol and DAI is capital agnostic.   Maker contracts don\u2019t care if good or bad entities have collateral and want to borrow capital.    Nation states do care though. Right now I see two realistic Maker\u2019s and DAI:   MakerC and DAIC where C means \u2018seeking to be regulatory compliant world wide\u2019 whatever that means.   This compliant entity can easily make RWA deals, it can be homed in a friendly jurisdiction and in effect comply with all appropriate regulations, laws, taxes etc.   MakerP and DAIP where P means \u2018pirate\u2019 which means to be completely decentralized and permissionless.  MakerP is DeFI finance that is unconcerned about jurisdiction, regulatory compliance, taxes etc. MakerP has to be completely decentralized, and anti-fragile and permissionless.   The money it makes with respect to people in jurisdictions should be considered \u2018sanctioned\u2019.   The current Maker (which I have called Maker2.0) by relying on permissionless DAI and trying to be in the pigeon stance is in effect trying to exist as (2) above.  Maker and DAI being pirate exposes all Maker participants to unexpected juridictionally launched broadsides that expose everyone associated with Maker and DAI to unprecedented risks.    The idea that Maker and DAI somehow is going to fly its pirate flag under the radar of nation states is hopeful at best and existential risk for everyone associated at worst. It was my hope that Maker could build two symbiotic protocols that say the MakerC/DAIC could support the building of MakerP/DAIP but I come to believe this may not be possible.   These two protocols have to be firewalled I don\u2019t think they can co-exist or co-mingle, the goals and designs of one incompatible with the other - across the board (from collater, to CU/BU structures, to contractors and operations, financiing, etc. etc.) My question to MakerDAO is who believes that EndGame or any form or version of Maker with permissionless DAI could ever consider to be anything but (2) and build consistently with that vision and view while still incorporating any elements from MakerC (trying to integrate at all with RWA and ignoring jurisdictional regulatory compliance). ADDED NOTE:   MakerP is completely incompatible with points (1) and (4) above Thoughts? Discussion encouraged. ",

The balancing act between decentralization and scaling is very important. Below is my vision for achieving DAI scalability goals while ensuring it minimizes existential risks. For both goals to co-exist, the important tasks of setting collateral limits should be completed. I think this is possible but would require an understanding community to consider both sides and be able to move forward while compromising on personal views.

One thing that I keep hearing is that people are worried because DAI doesn\u2019t have an on-chain DenyList like Tether or USDC. I don\u2019t think the lack of a DenyList is very important for gov\u2019t regulators. There is already way a to transfer value over the Ethereum blockchain that is not supervised by an on-chain DenyList\u2014the native Eth token. So why would regulators care all that much whether DAI has an on-chain DenyList or not? Since DAI or ETH transactions are not private, it is easy enough for regulators to add specific wallet addresses to an off-chain DenyList that they can share with crypto/fiat exchanges and force them to comply with. My opinion is that DAI lacking a built-in, on-chain DenyList is of little consequence to regulators. ",

                    "content": "It is simply not technically possible to implement a blacklist or compliance tools on Dai. No matter how much you want to, it will never be possible. You\u2019d have to completely shut down and replace the token, and that would destroy the entire advantage and value of Dai, which is the broad adoption and integration of the existing ERC20 token. The dream that Psychonaut is arguing for is great - It will be a huge advantage for us if regulators will be fine with treating Dai as an unregulated technology like ETH or a public utility (even if it runs a business model like a bank and plugs into their regulated financial systems). We should hope it plays out that way, and take advantage of it as long as it is seems safe to do so, and do everything we can to convince authorities that regulating at the edges will be enough. But we shouldn\u2019t be naive and assume that just because we wish for it, it will remain that way forever. Instead we need to prepare contingency plans to deal with the possible risks. If we never have to use them, that\u2019s great. But we should always be prepared. ",

                    "content": "@Rune, the concern I have with the vigilance path you outlined is that for a lot of us, the level of regulatory attack that would make Phoenix Stance necessary for the platform\u2019s survival would also mean that as a practical matter, we could not participate in the platform. Even though I am pretty new here, I really like this community; there are a lot of really smart people and thoughtful discussions.  I would be sad to go.  But if OFAC puts MakerDAO and the Dai smart contract on the SDN list and Justice is actively fining and imprisoning Dai users just for being Dai users, I\u2019m out; I\u2019ve also got a family that I love and need to think about.  Further, my real world identity is in several PMs on the forum and discord; I would not even be allowed to stick around, and the risk and cost of developing a new anonymous persona would not be worth the reward. In that max-facist regulatory scenario, I guess it would be good to know that some form of Dai survived, but for me, practically speaking, Dai and Maker would be dead. So instead, rather than resiliency, the key is to avoid being regulated to functional oblivion.  In the short term, that means not declaring ourselves to be fundamentally non-compliant.  To that end, I agree with @psychonaut\u2013despite the TC action, it is not clear that users and administrators of a protocol without a DenyList are necessarily noncompliant.  TC was a special case, with levels of money laundering simply not found in Dai.  Moreover, we have seen regulated entities refusing to blacklist TC addresses.  Taking the position that we are intrinsically non-compliant would seem to only increase the likelihood that regulators agree with us and shut us down/shut us out. In the medium term, I think we need lobbying.  We need professionals in national capitals and state legislatures explaining how Dai makes remittances cheaper, how it offers a better, privacy-forward alternative to the Chinese and other national CBDCs, how it is secured by a broad basket of goods, and (importantly) how fiat on-ramps and off-ramps like coinbase allow a decentralized stablecoin to coexist with regulatory structures. And in the long term, we need more assets to actually be denominated in and securing Dai loans.  People should be able to get a mortgage in Dai and in turn, they should demand to get paid in Dai.  Businesses should be able to get lines of credit in Dai.  The ecosystem should expand such that most lending of Dai is by third parties (who can choose to be compliant, and engage in their own lobbying).  But again, I doubt that this can happen if we are under a severe regulatory attack and/or Dai is so inflationary that the interest rates are exorbitant and/or may pay-in-Dai buys less and less every month.
