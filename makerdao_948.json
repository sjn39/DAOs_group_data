                    "content": "Several community members have expressed ideas/concerns/potential solutions recently. MakerDAO, both CU and the community, are clearly signalling that things are not going so well. I want to add my 2 cents on a specific (sub-)topic, that of minimality.  History: \u201cminimal \u2192 larger \u2192 BIG/BLOAT \u2192 minimal\u201d. In a recently interview @NikKunkel was asked: what kind of collaterals do you think Maker will have in the future? His answer was: BTC + ETH + RWAs. This is interesting, as it highlights the following path we followed:   MakerDAO started extremely simple with single collateral DAI, with just ETH.   Then a huge technological advancement happened with multi collateral DAI. At launch, in 2019, MakerDAO included the BAT token and a couple of others.   Over the months, MakerDAO experimented with many other tokens. This phase is extremely important. It provides case studies, experience, new challenges and solutions, etc.   Ultimately the DAO realised that it\u2019s pointless to have 2000 altcoins with low marketcap (like BAT mentioned above), given the high costs (Risks, oracles, etc).   It looks like (following @NikKunkel\u2019s vision, which I believe is shared by most) that we are going back to a minimalistic setup.   It should be stressed that there is virtue is having followed this path. We have dynamically explored the space, matured educated opinions, and ultimately settled for the best tradeoff. Also, some things like the PSM, staked ETH, etc are a result of this \u201cresearch\u201d. TL&DL: thinks are good when you start small, very focused, you grow quickly exploring available options but you are also quick in adapting and backtracking.  RWA ? Sometimes Less is More. I believe we are in a similar situation right now (as it\u2019s natural and expected!) with respect to RWA. In 2020 the community signalled (here) that it wanted to focus on RWA embarking. I myself voted for YES.  Accordingly, the Maker Foundation and subsequently the CUs have spent a tremendous amount of time (and money) researching this. I believe it starts to be time to evaluate the situation after such significant amount of time/efforts/work/investment.   MakerDAO explored many directions. Some even involved CUs (@SebVentures) to fly to the Cayman\u2019s island doing research and setting up legal structures.   Some have produced some results, some are just starting, some others are dead branches, etc.  As expected.   Now I am starting to think that, without stopping the great work done so far, we need to follow a path towards minimalism and simplification regarding RWA. Personally, I think we should downsize and pick the one or two most promising projects, ask the CUs to make an explicit projection on how this expected to grow over time (in order to evaluate results) and proceed. E.g. \u201cWe keep up with the SocGen deal, and we project 1b DAI of collateral by the end of 2023.\u201d In an ideal world, RWA tokenisation would be done by 3rd party entities. The fact that this is not yet the case, signifies that the crypto space (and regulations) are not yet mature enough at this stage. QUESTION: Do we still really want to focus MakerDAO on actively searching and embarking RWA at this stage (2022/2023)? Maybe a better choice is to  wait the crypto space to grow organically on the RWA front, wait for 3rd parties to tokenise RWAs, and in the meanwhile focus on \u2018technical\u2019 (i.e., coding related) efforts. I am more and more of the opinion that Maker should focus instead on technical things: L2, integrations with other protocols, Oracle expansion, security, etc. These are the fields where Maker has ruled from day 0 and still does today. Let\u2019s focus on where we know we have a great ratio: results/(resources invested)  CUs, less \u201ccommunist state\u201d, more \u201cFranchise\u201d \u2192 Reward those that actually bring money to the table. If I think that no CUs existed until ~1 year ago, I am amazed how far we have gone in just 12 months. This is result of some pretty amazing work and talent. Thanks everybody! As in all other situation, MakerDAO has dynamically experimented with several people and CU. Some are going great. Some others were terminated. This is good. But as usual, we now (or at some point) need to follow the path towards simplification. In my view the best approach to this is that of:  identifying a minimal CORE, a set of competences/core-units that are absolutely necessary for MakerDAO to exist and run. all others should be somehow organised as 3rd party service-providers with a revenue sharing model, some kind of franchise, basically. If a CU brings money to the table, nobody will ever complain about salaries, parties at conferences, etc.  What seems to make people annoyed is the feeling of a communist organisation, where some CUs/people are just sucking resources without giving back actual \u201cvalue\u201d to MKR holders (even if this may not be true under the hood).  TL&DR: Let\u2019s downsize the focus on MakerDAO. Let\u2019s focus on where we know we have a competitive advantage now (technology, smart contracts, DAI issuance, etc). MakerDAO cannot afford to be a research institution. Research/experimentation can be incubated (as done very well by SES), but ultimately should be left alone to fly, incentivised by a franchise/revenue-sharing mechanism. ",

The author suggests downsizing the focus on RWAs and instead focusing on technical efforts such as L2, integrations with other protocols, and Oracle expansion. The author also proposes identifying a minimal core of competencies necessary for MakerDAO to exist and run, with all other services provided by third-party service providers with a revenue-sharing model. The post ends with a call to focus on where MakerDAO has a competitive advantage and to incentivize those who bring money to the table.",
