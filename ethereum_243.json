We propose to add basic marketplace functionality to the ERC721  standard to allow projects creators to gain back that control. It includes: ~ a method to list an item for sale or update an existing listing, whether private sale (only to a specific address) or public (to anyone), ~ a method to delist an item that has previously been listed, ~ a method to purchase a listed item, ~ a method to view all items listed for sale, and ~ a method to view a specific listing. This interface could also be adapted for ERC1155 standard, but might require adjustments Edit: This proposal is both compliant with OpenSea\u2019s snippet and safe from it as it doesn\u2019t need to make usage of the transfer(), safeTransfer(), and approve() functions. This way, if OpenSea suddenly decided to completely block all other marketplaces, your internal marketplace can still operate. ",
