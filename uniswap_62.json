                    "content": "Hey everybody \u2014 this is Nadav from Dharma. Since August, our business has been razor-focused on providing a mainstream-friendly experience for trading in Uniswap. We have successfully onboarded over 2,500 new users onto Uniswap in the span of just a month who otherwise would have likely floundered with the clunkiness of Metamask, gas fees, etc.  This has been really great for our business, and we\u2019re basically doubling down all of our energies on making Uniswap something anyone with a US bank account and zero crypto knowledge can use instantly. Unfortunately, the way the retroactive airdrop was architected seemed to make a slight oversight in the snapshotting process \u2014 only addresses which directly called the Uniswap contracts were considered to be users.  Our system (as well as many other more consumer-oriented systems) interact with Uniswap through a proxy contract. As a result, approximately 2,000 users who used Uniswap through Dharma are ineligible to claim UNI rewards. This is not an issue isolated to Dharma due to an esoteric design choice \u2014 proxy contracts are very commonly used by interfaces that interact with Uniswap.  Notably, DEX aggregators such as Matcha and Paraswap have confirmed they are also affected, and we believe others are quite likely to be affected as well. From our discussions with the Uniswap team, it seems highly unlikely that the intention of the retroactive airdrop was to exclude users who did not directly call Uniswap.  In all likelihood, this was an innocent oversight. As such, we\u2019re considering submitting a proposal (perhaps the first!) to Uniswap governance to expand the UNI retroactive airdrop to those who used Uniswap through proxy contracts before Sept. 1st.  Our team is very experienced with submitting proposals to the Compound governance module and we feel quite confident we could do this securely and quickly. That being said, we first wanted to gauge interest and reactions from the Uniswap community. I will note to the community that this vote sets a cultural precedent as to how the protocol treats not only its direct users but also developers who take entrepreneurial bets building on Uniswap. The status quo has unfortunately punished our users and eroded our reputation with them \u2014 future builders will heed the signal and precedent set by how the Uniswap community addresses this. Interested to hear feedback and thoughts; technical discussion around how best to structure this proposal highly encouraged! Nadav Edit: Really happy to see what appears to be an overwhelmingly positive response to the high-level proposal.  I would like to shift the discussion to more specific, technical matters related to how we can implement this proposal \u2014 please skip down to this message to add color to the specifics Edit 2: The latest proposal can be found down here.  We intend to discuss is it for the next 24 hours before proceeding [9/17/20 10:05PM MT] ",

They have internally used Uniswap/other exchanges for token swaps and it has definitely helped additional users to jump onboard due to the power of strong design thinking. It will be great if Uniswap could include Dharma users for the $uni airdrops. It will definitely help the community grow in a positive manner. ",

I believe we all appreciate a lot Uniswap protocol and would be gratefull a lot for appreciating our activity, no matter if it was direct or proxy originated. I kond of understand that first of all Uniswap wanted to appreciate their direct users, as some could not even be aware of uniswap existance, they just new some app which happened to use uniswap in background, so basically those were not uniswap users. I get it. However I think many of us, including myself, just used some app they like conciously knowing that uniswap is behind that. Even more, that was the reason to use that particular app at all. So please appreciate our effort to support DeFi community of any kind as we ALL will benefit from it as the whole market grows with us allowing to earn also to you, uniswap. It is all connected.

                    "content": "Glad to hear there\u2019s significant interest in this proposal.  Would like to shift the discussion to some of the specifics of how such a system would be implemented. There are two high-level questions that need to be answered before we submit a proposal: #1 \u2014 How will we execute the retroactive airdrop for excluded users, if approved? #2 \u2014 How will we determine the set of users who have been excluded from the drop? Re: #1 \u2014 I feel there is a fairly straightforward proposal here. In approximately 7 hours, vesting of the community treasury UNI allocation will begin, with a 30 day cliff ending on \u2248October 17th, 2020.  At that point, 172,000,000 / 12 \u2248 14.3m UNI will become available to the community treasury. Once we\u2019ve aligned the community on a set of excluded users, we deploy a merkle drop contract akin to the one Uniswap used for the initial airdrop that commits too this user set and to the quantity to which they\u2019re entitled. We can then initiate a governance proposal that grants ERC20 transfer approval from the timelock contract (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) to the merkle drop contract in the amount precisely equal to the quantity agreed upon for excluded users.  This means we can vote to \u201cconfirm\u201d the distribution to excluded users now, and the distributed UNI will be withdrawable in approximately 30 days \u2014 the merkle drop contract will be able to pull the UNI at that time and make the UNI claimable by users. Re: #2 \u2014 This is where I suspect the locus of contention will be: how do we determine the excluded user set? I will propose a few approaches for discussion (note that, for all of these approaches, we would de-dupe addresses that are already present in the current UNI distribution):  Compile a list of all addresses (contracts or EOAs) that are in the call-chain of historical calls to Uniswap v1 /  v2 before Sept 1. \u2014 i.e. if a Uniswap trade was triggered as EOA -> ContractA -> ContractB -> UniswapV2, all three addresses would be considered to be \u201cusers\u201d.  This is likely the most comprehensive, but I fear would be overly liberal in allocating UNI.. A rough analysis of on-chain data is required here. Compile the same list of addresses described in approach #1, but limit them to 1-hop proxies \u2014 i.e. we make a simplifying assumption that you are only a \u201cuser\u201d of Uniswap if you either call Uniswap directly or call a contract that calls Uniswap directly.  This would work well for Dharma and would likely narrow the set described in approach #1 significantly \u2014 but may exclude other interfaces / projects who use multiple-chained contracts  Finally, we can do this much more \u201csurgically\u201d \u2014 i.e. Dharma pulls it\u2019s list of affected users, Matcha pulls their list, Paraswap theirs, etc. etc. Though this would certainly limit the amount of UNI being distributed to a conservative number, it would also invite a lot of subjectivity into this process that may hamper its likelihood of passing as a proposal.   Would love to hear thoughts (in particular from other projects that have been affected) on what would be the maximally inclusive way of doing this that spends the least UNI from the community treasury ",

From an end-user standpoint, any affected wallets / implementations basically just give users the ability to claim their UNI now (with an X day lockup until the eventual point when the UNI can actually be withdrawn / traded).

This is likely the most comprehensive, but I fear would be overly liberal in allocating UNI. . A rough analysis of on-chain data is required here.   Compile the same list of addresses described in approach #1, but limit them to 1-hop proxies \u2014 i.e. we make a simplifying assumption that you are only a \u201cuser\u201d of Uniswap if you either call Uniswap directly or call a contract that calls Uniswap directly. This would work well for Dharma and would likely narrow the set described in approach #1 significantly \u2014 but may exclude other interfaces / projects who use multiple-chained contracts   Finally, we can do this much more \u201csurgically\u201d \u2014 i.e. Dharma pulls it\u2019s list of affected users, Matcha pulls their list, Paraswap theirs, etc. etc. Though this would certainly limit the amount of UNI being distributed to a conservative number, it would also invite a lot of subjectivity into this process that may hamper its likelihood of passing as a proposal.     One consideration with 1. and 2. is there are likely arbitrageurs / bots / relayers with thousands or tens of thousands of addresses that trade through custom smart contract proxies that would receive hundreds of thousands of UNI from this proposal. Maximally inclusive sounds nice but I imagine will result in sending UNI to over >100,000 addresses (only <2% of which would be Dharma users) its worth noting governance can always vote to allocate more UNI in the future, but can\u2019t ever get back UNI it unnecessarily wasted.

Uniswap doesn\u2019t even generate revenue from gas either, gas is always paid to the miners who execute smart contracts, never the contracts themselves. @wazza @kbridge @neverselling ",

I take the argument that some of these aggregators are their own product, and Uniswap is simply used as infrastructure to facilitate the trade. I think there is a good case that users of these protocols are not users of Uniswap in the same sense as someone who interacts directly with the app. I\u2019m thinking, for instance, of Kyber users. That said, for apps like Dharma who were explicit that their users were interacting with Uniswap, I think the case is much clearer. Dharma themselves marketed this Uniswap integration as little more than a convenient, user-friendly front end, built directly into their wallet. I think these users are Uniswap users. Certainly, arbitrage bots with hundreds or thousands of addresses should not benefit from a secondary distribution. I would propose that if there is a secondary distribution to include this edge case, then it should be done on a per protocol basis where governance decides whether it would be in the spirit of the distribution to extend it to the users of each service, app or protocol.

A huge mistake Uniswap team did was not considering the multiple addresses of same users and rewarding them , any person who uses say 10-50 addresses to trade in Uniswap already have got disproportionate amount of rewards and In future they will try to do so more as I think team didn\u2019t think of sybil attack , as there is no way to measure sybil attack and hoping the percentage of dubplicate addresses with same users to be low, I congratulate Uniswap for giving every small traders the reward. Once Dharma can make sure the users are first time users and not traded in Uniswap and getting rewards two times ,rewards to Dharma should be released and rest of them should be added to treasury for any future use. Yes but every new project sending airdrop of any kind should try to find ways to uniquely identify users and disincentivies Sybil rewards. ",

And when it comes to Dharma, it\u2019s not as same as trading through just another Eth address. On metamask, with one seed phrase, you can create multiple eth addresses. On Dharma, you need to set up an email and password and once you delete the Dharma app from your phone, recovery of your smart wallet is through support. So, it\u2019s not the same.

                    "content": "Wow, OK \u2014 this discussion is spiraling in a variety of directions. Let me try to focus things here: In contradiction to what I said above, though, I have heard several anecdotes in private discussions indicating that expanding the UNI distribution to the \u201cmaximally inclusive / non-discretionary\u201d options I listed above may abusively advantage arbitrageurs.  Allegedly, an oft-used infrastructural setup for such users is to have a single proxy contract with a large number of (circa 1000s) EOAs attached, and, unfortunately, the clever design suggested previously by @AgentSmith could succumb to this if it purely lived at the protocol layer. This isn\u2019t to say that the initial allocation was maximally sybil-resistant or \u201cfair\u201d \u2013 but, in a sense, we\u2019re better-positioned to not repeat or exacerbate drawbacks in a \u201cprogrammatically-objective\u201d distribution strategy now that we have governance. My revised proposal then would be as follows \u2014 establish clear \u201cinclusion criteria\u201d for wallets, interfaces, and aggregators whose users have been excluded from the distribution, collect a list of addresses from said wallets, and then use that list to create the initial merkle root for the allocation. The goal here will be to keep the allocation minimally surgical. In more detail: Inclusion Criteria We define \u201cprojects\u201d as being any entity whose users were excluded from the retroactive UNI allocation due to the proxy contract issue identified above. In order to be eligible for inclusion in this distribution, a \u201cproject\u201d must meet the following criteria:   Prior to September 1st, they exposed a publicly-available user interface either on web or in an integrated mobile application that allowed users to make trades on Uniswap in some capacity.  We include DEX aggregators in this definition \u2014 UNI holders ultimately get their paycheck from market takers, not makers.  Aggregators are fundamentally in the interest of Uniswap\u2019s success.   It must be clearly verifiable that said interface / application was available to users prior to September 1st (e.g. if this is not immediately obvious that this is the case, the burden of proof is on the project for demonstrating, for instance, that an interface can be loaded on Wayback Machine, etc.)   It must be clearly verifiable that said interface / application at the time hooked into a proxy contract calling into Uniswap.  Again \u2014 if this is not immediately obvious or verifiable, the burden of proof is on the project to demonstrate this.   Finally, the project should provide a list of addresses of affected users.  It must be clearly verifiable that those addresses are associated with the proxy contract system previously identified to be associated with the project.  Once again, if this is not immediately obvious, the burden of proof lays with the project.   All provided addresses will be verified against historical Uniswap v1 and v2 calls to exclude any addresses that were not in the call-chain of a Uniswap transaction (successful or failed).  Open-source code to verify that this is indeed the case will be published for independent review. All addresses will be verified for not having been in the initial retroactive UNI allocation. Discussion Period We set aside the following 24 hours for discussion & debate of the above criteria.  Once the 24 hours elapse, we move into the Application Period Application Period A thread will be posted in the governance forum where projects will be asked to submit short, public applications on behalf of their users.  This will be a handful of questions we will post into a template in the thread\u2019s OP.  We will reserve 48 hours for submission and inline discussion / debate. Submission Once a set of projects is decided upon, said projects will be asked to submit a list of affected user addresses in a public thread. Those addresses will be verified against the aforementioned criteria using publicly available code we will publish. We will then compile a merkle root for the distribution, deploy a merkle drop contract referencing that root, and will initiate a governance proposal to grant approval to said contract, with triggering scheduled for October 17th, 2020. To correct some misconceptions that appear to be circulating above \u2014 this allocation will be no more dilutive than the normal state of affairs; it will come out of the community treasury in which UNI is continuously vesting. Moreover, our intention is to be as surgical as possible \u2014 our hope is to limit the expanded allocation to the single-digit thousands.  We are open to employing a methodology akin to the one previously suggested by @AgentSmith (i.e. users must claim their distribution on-chain prior to October 17th, so only a strictly claim'd amount is transferred to the merkle drop contracgt), though the end-result numbers may militate towards this approach being overkill.

If you are not technical enough to use Uniswap on your own, without having to rely on a 3rd party, you are not the type of person to make educated decisions on complex protocol governance.   Because using metamask and the uniswap web app requires such expert technical skills? If you follow this line of reasoning, the airdrop should only have been given to users who called the smart contract interface directly (not via the web app). ",

There is clearly a way to work with the Proxy Contract systems (Dharma, 1Inch, etc.) to gather the list of users that are entitled to the airdrop. As for those pointing out that \u201cx other person used Uniswap starting on Sept 2. and they didn\u2019t get any UNI, why should you\u201d, I would just loop back to purpose of the airdrop and the UNI protocol in general. It is to reward those who have supported Uniswap and DeFi over the long run. Users of services like Dharma and 1Inch certainly fall into that category - they\u2019ve provided liquidity, fees, etc. to Uniswap and contributed massively to its growth. It is absolutely justified to reward those users in the exact same way that direct Uniswap users were rewarded. As @litocoen said, \u201cUniswap has shown that it wants a fair distribution with UNI tokens going to EVERY user. Even ones that had FAILED transactions. I don\u2019t think they wanted to leave out Dharma users and besides usage through proxy contracts should be encouraged as it simplifies the UX.\u201d ",

A future airdrop of coins is unfair to those who immediately sold their 400 UNIs, as it was unknown whether or not the coin would gain traction.  If those users had known, they probably would have held their coins at least a little longer.  So the beneficiaries of this proposal have the advantage of knowing future value, in a sense.  A compromise would be that, on the date of any distribution, the amount of coins distributed would be in relation to the current market price vs. the initial price.  Let\u2019s say the average initial price was $2.50, if UNI is trading at $7.50 on that date, only a third of coins should be distributed, as an example.   It is in the interest of UNI coinholders to have users use the Uniswap platform directly.  If a third party wants to access it, there is definitely a benefit to everyone too, as these synergies do help the ecosystem, and I see that argument too.  Perhaps the third party app should reward its user with its own native token to some degree as well as requesting UNI.  I cannot request this native token because I don\u2019t use the 3rd party apps.  In this way, the amount of UNI in a potential distribution should be, as an example, quartered from the amount given to actual users.   So, a compromise counterproposal would be:  100 UNI, only to users who make a valid claim (TBD how), divided by (the market price of UNI on the day of distribution / $2.50).  The claimants could also request the native token of the platform they traded on as well, and it would be up to the platform if it wanted to distribute ownership interests, or not.  These numbers are just guidelines at this time, but, I feel like this is a real compromise that I would vote approval on. ",

We are all early users and were all rewarded. My rough guess is that there will be less than 25k addresses which will qualify for airdrop to proxy users and Nadav even said it will be in single digit thousands- less than 10k. If not, these users will feel left out. And if these users are given 400 UNI each, then this will be a nice gesture that composability is welcome and is rewarded. In future, this will motivate more projects to build on top of and side by side of each other. I understand the concerns of some users and at the base, the reason must be that these new airdrop receivers will sell and that each is getting $2500-$3000. But in my opinion, this wouldn\u2019t be such a terrible thing as UNI is in heavy demand and this will be just a small price to pay for a broader distribution and a more wider community with more positive sentiment and loyalty towards the project. @haydenadams I would love to hear your thoughts on this proposal.

Which of these would be more worthy of a UNI airdrop?

If the purpose of the 400 UNI is to reward participants, then a user that accessed uniswap, and paid their uniswap exchange fee, regardless of method, should IMO receive their UNI. I don\u2019t see any material difference in connecting directly vs connecting via an aggregator. Both users have identical impact on revenue. Aggregators/dapps providing access to uniswap is a mutually beneficial arrangement, creating a hierarchy of users I believe would be a counter productive president to set. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the thoughtful post, Nadav! I generally agree with your assessment and the effort to be as surgical as possible as a means of maximizing equity for legitimate users and capital efficiency for the community treasury. In that spirit, I describe in point 3 (below) how elements of my previous suggestion can benefit users when integrated with your revised proposal. I believe these elements will materially benefit overall UX and allocation outcomes, which I aim to demonstrate. I also believe it will address concerns you and @haydenadams have expressed. For clarity, I\u2019ll recap my understanding of your proposal along with my suggested amendment in a rough OKR format & procedural outline. Objective: Identify, verify, & make whole all excluded, legitimate users eligible for UNI in the most equitable, frictionless, transparent, and capital efficient manner possible. Note: \u201clegitimate users\u201d is defined here as individual users utilizing projects that incorporate Uniswap for personal trading and are not engaged in arbitrage or other use cases involving enmassed EOAs. Key results:   Legitimate users are identified & included in finalized Merkle root (by extension, arbitrageurs, bots, and relayers are identified & maximally excluded)   Code & identified addresses are independently verifiable by users   Legitimate, excluded users recieve UNI as though omission never occurred.   Amended process proposal:   Identify projects via Nadav\u2019s aforementioned Inclusion Criteria   Selected projects generate lists of affected users which will be verified against historical Uniswap v1 & v2 calls as well as UNI claims list to verify eligibility. This serves as preliminary Merkle root.   Users are able to independently verify their address has been included in preliminary Merkle root via a search bar similar to initial Uniswap claim UI and/or a CAPTCHA enabled form where addresses may be submitted and verification of inclusion is provided on submission.   If the user\u2019s address has been omitted, the user is additionally able to add it to a pending list via form logic for consideration and will be required to provide proof that they are not an arbitrager with 10+ wallets, while also meeting initial eligibility requirements. It is unlikely that projects with KYC would experience additional omissions but in the interest of benefitting users and mitigating future contention, I think this should be included. I believe user verification is an important feature in this process because it:   Provides users trustless/transparent assurance of inclusion & a dispute resolution process in the event of another unintended omission while eliminating the external locus of control they may otherwise feel.   Provides projects a secondary dataset to verify against. Lists generated by projects may still be vulnerable to inefficient inclusion, just as my previously suggested claim design is, but a combination of project lists and user verification should create a highly surgical (i.e. efficient & effective) dataset of EOAs.   In the event the end-result numbers exceed the projected goal of single digit thousands, user-generated verification could prove to be a viable solution to satisfy projects\u2019 burden of proof. This can also create metrics such as % of user verified EOAs to objectively confirm achievement of key results, which subsequently confirm achievement of our objective.   Merkle root is compiled using finalized list after completion of the vetting process described in 3   Deploy Merkle drop contract referencing that root.   Initiate governance proposal to grant approval   Potentially overkill option to optimize for capital efficiency:   Include claim function in addition to aforementioned verification process for Merkle drop contract and refund unclaimed UNI to community treasury after x claim period. This will add friction and be inherently more exclusive and labor intensive, but will have redundant verification that only active users will recieve drop. Thank you for your consideration and I hope my perspective positively influences the outcomes of all involved. ",

Sybil-resistance is not so simple to build into an application and it\u2019s not so simple to prove that someone is not an arbitrageur. Moreover, I would argue that folks who fall into the \u201cedge-case\u201d category of not having a project that will vouch for them in this process most likely developed their own proxy contracts to take actions on Uniswap.  It seems a bit unlikely to me that those users wouldn\u2019t have already had the technical acumen to use Uniswap directly and, in turn, gotten a UNI payout elsewhere.  I would be surprised if there are more than 10 people in the world whose first and only interaction with Uniswap was through Solidity code. ",

Sure there are some token pairs that can only be traded on uniswap but for many of the more liquid pairs there\u2019s nothing to stop platforms from directing trading volume to another DEX instead. Uniswap is a fantastic protocol and money lego, but its true value comes from the integrations with other money legos in the ethereum ecosystem. Ensuring that the users and developers of these third party platforms feel like a valued part of the uniswap community would be a rational investment in the future of uniswap and its token. ",

                    "content": "After some internal and talks with our community of users, we quickly realized that DeFi Saver users are for the most part in a similar boat as Dharma users. As mentioned earlier, the architecture that transactions made via DeFi Saver follow in terms of Uniswap interactions is: Tx Sender -> User\u2019s DSProxy -> DFS UniswapWrapper <> Uniswap. However, due to our Automation services the Tx Sender can be either the User\u2019s actual account, or an Automation bot account. We believe the fairest approach in terms of DeFi Saver users would be for Users\u2019 DSProxy accounts to be included, instead of Tx Sender accounts, since many DeFi Saver users exclusively use our Automation services for their leveraging and de-leveraging trades on their MakerDAO and Compound positions, in which case the Tx Sender is not User\u2019s Account, but rather one of our Automation bot accounts (very similar to Dharma where they sign and send transactions for their users, if I understand correctly). For example, 71% of DeFi Saver transactions that include token swaps in August have been initiated by Automation bots. This approach would make sure that the receipients of the UNI aidrop are the actual accounts whose funds were being swapped and not our team owned Automation bot accounts (of which we have at least 10 currently active and many more that were previously used) that were merely signing and sending these transactions, on behalf of actual user accounts. As all DeFi Saver features revolve around the DSProxy architecture, all funds involved in all trades made via Uniswap were indeed originating from Users\u2019 DSProxies, which hold either their MakerDAO CDPs/Vaults or their Compound portfolios. Additionally, we would like to highlight that we already have an interface available for User accounts to withdraw any tokens (e.g. UNI in this case) from their User DSProxies, meaning this approach would not be creating an issue for anyone. We are open on feedback and discussion on this, of course. ",

All of us, right now, are currently missing opportunities that we don\u2019t even know about. That doesn\u2019t entitle us to rewards once we hear about them. I have seen so many threads on this, and heard pretty much every excuse as to why it should be extended, and none of them have a net benefit for the system. All arguments boil down to entitled people who are envious that other people got something they want. This is the behavior of toddlers, and toddlers won\u2019t provide good decision-making going forward. After gas fees, failed transactions, and other slow Ether drain since Uniswap started, the airdrop was basically a reimbursement for many long time users. ",

                    "content": "The current argument surely isn\u2019t about literally extending the airdrop to those who weren\u2019t Uniswap users prior to September 1 but the difference in the announcement blog post between:  \"15% of UNI  150,000,000 UNI  can immediately be claimed by  historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders  based on a snapshot ending September 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC.  and  \"400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes  ~12,000  addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions \u2014 love you guys.  The fact seems clear that many users did not call directly either contract, and while the first statement in the blog post says users can claim UNI, the second only says addresses that directly called the contracts. In that sense, people feel entitled because, frankly, the announcement\u2019s language entitles them. The ambiguity exists because the second paragraph only seems to expand the definition of those able to claim to include those addresses who did not literally successfully use Uniswap but only had attempted to do so as well as affirming that \u201cusers\u201d definitely includes \u201caddresses that have directly interacted with the contracts\u201d, it doesn\u2019t exclude any who ordinarily may have thought of themselves as users or have actually in some way used Uniswap via an indirect mean, knowingly or not knowingly. It also doesn\u2019t include them. The tokens entitle governance, and this creates a situation where we have seen people use - as in in some way interact, ultimately, with the Uniswap contracts, complete swaps or attempt to complete swaps or provide liquidity or attempt to provide liquidity, but because of some distinction made later that they at the time certainly can\u2019t be aware of mattering, be left out of the process. Yes, it\u2019s about entitlement, but that\u2019s because who is and who isn\u2019t entitled in the promise made here is unclear and a binary choice. Whether they want to use the tokens for governance or just dump them or whatever, none of that matters here. It\u2019s a matter of interpreting ambiguities in the language in what was already promised. It doesn\u2019t help that immediately after the graphic in the blog the paragraph states:  With 15% of tokens already available to be claimed by historical users and liquidity providers, the governance treasury will retain 43% [430,000,000 UNI] of UNI supply to distribute on an ongoing basis through  contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining , and other programs.  So once again, \u201cusers\u201d. The decision really needs to be about what these terms mean and are supposed to mean. Instead of all the policy discussion we should really entirely focus on the ambiguity here in the language - unless there\u2019s another document somewhere that more definitively defines who is and isn\u2019t entitled as intended, in which case I would really appreciate it to be linked. Cheers. edit: Just refining the ultimate question can be boiled down to: Does a \u201cuser\u201d include addresses (by extension really those who had control of the addresses) that ultimately had their assets interact with the Uniswap contracts, and: a) Have done so without knowing to have done so, or b) Have done so with the understanding that they have done so, or c) Have done so thinking that they have actually chosen to do so and because of various reasons (technical ability, platform confusion or obfuscation, etc) have only, as it turns out, interacted through a proxy. BTW This is why these things get written up by lawyers so because this is definitively something that should have been made clear ahead of time. ",

You did the same here. I don\u2019t know how you can call this ridiculous when not only does it affect actual people, but also the blog from the devs say things that are clearly interpreted in ways that many found unsatisfactory.  This is ridiculous. Uniswap chose to airdrop the uni token as they saw fit.  Unless you can get an actual statement stating that the tokens were dropped as they see fit and that is it - not partially, not just what\u2019s conveinent, but in thact this is the outer limit, then I don\u2019t know how you can justify that. Are you Uniswap? How do you know if the choice is a final one that is inclusive of exactly the intended? And if they said \u201cusers\u201d multiple times and yet, dropped the tokens to \u201cthose who they saw fit\u201d, that\u2019s a phrase that isn\u2019t even in the original post, so where are you gleaming their intent from? People make mistakes, code have bugs, best laid plans of mice and men, etc. But how do we know that if the text doesn\u2019t say that?  It was to ACTUAL people who logged into and used their website and program.  Again, this doesn\u2019t even represent a huge portion of the people who actually did get the tokens. Are you suggesting some sort of rollback in case? I primarily used contracts and eth calls to interact with the swap. Does not using the front end mean that I didn\u2019t use Uniswap? Is Uniswap just the front end? There\u2019s no way this assertion can at all be true unless you want to take away people\u2019s tokens afterwards. How would this even make sense?  I don\u2019t even know why there\u2019s a discussion about this.  Because there\u2019s an ambiguity and for some reason people keep calling it ridiculous while asserting things backed not by the text of the announcement which people have relied on, but rather, just their opinions and instincts. I was under the imrpession that governance requires knowledge and evidence, not just. I\u2019m happy to see any evidence to the contrary except I haven\u2019t seen much of anything,.  Those people weren\u2019t using uniswap they were using an aggregators who did the work of finding the best prices for them which is totally different than even using uniswap.  And that was my whole point in the end. There are at least three groups of people who \u201cused\u201d in the commonly understood dictionary sense with Uniswap contracts (and one group that didn\u2019t but were counted anyway as they intended to use but failed due to the blockchain).  What is \u201cuse\u201d, and in what context does it count for \u201cuse\u201d in this case? The factual matter is that for the addresses listed in teh Git repo of the lists, all thoe addresses/contracts were interacting and swapping with UNI. Some may have known that they were doiing it indirectly, some may not. Either hway, we\u2019re not mind-readers, And I think it would be appropriate to back up any assertions with hard evidence that is literallya part of the record or otherwise it goes offt he rails really fast. The problem is very simple, but it\u2019s absolutely not ridiculous unless schadenfreude is your thing,. Don\u2019t minimize any of this. We have votes because your definition of \"using \" and mine are almost necessarily different and we both got airdropped anyway. Usuaslly we have a court to try to fix the difference, and we don\u2019t have an in depejndent judiciary in a decentralized way. I\u2019m happy to address any objections but I personally go with the original text announcement first, that is more ort less the public founding document, since that\u2019s all we got to start with. Unless a dev can come out to state exactly what they had intended to do, that must be where we start. What\u2019s ridiculous about that except somehow this didn\u2019t get defined beforehand and cause a lot less trouble and disussion. edit: Straightening up train of thought, been a long day ",

We need to clear this up at least, whether we distribute the tokens or not, because that\u2019s basically the essence of governance. This affects literally thousands of addresses. The defi ecosystem is heavy on credibility of individual actors and projects and so, how would people feel about those who paritcipated in, however directly but still factually, in Uniswap\u2019s success yet are excluded because of a failure to properly define the parameters? Longer more in depth points: BTW, I am a lawyer by training and background but I\u2019m speaking on my personal behalf as a member of the community. I\u2019m not interpreting or giving advice as to the laws of any jurisdiction and should not be construed as doing so. However, governance represents essentially the setting out, creation, and application of legalistic standards within a community. If your participation in the community is to say \u201clet\u2019s turn this into a CEX\u201d then, you\u2019re welcome to be here but it seems to be the wrong venue for such an argument, but by arguing that \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d and that the dev\u2019s actions to the current moment is immutable and final and can be determined as such (by who, you?) then why even engage in governance? \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done\u201d means you never go back to fix things if what\u2019s done was done badly. I\u2019m not talking about it in legal terms, but general, every day terms. We\u2019re also not talking about illegality - we\u2019re making the laws here, but there are matters of equity outside of the law that still apply, as in, community trust, unequal treatment, not fulfilling promises, making ambiguous promises. You surely have experienced some sort of situation where it\u2019s not a legal wrong but nevertheless, a wrongful act to your detriment that you feel that someone broke a promise or did something untoward that you feel aggrieved about. Setting laws and codes and definitions, in the small community here, is a way to avoid that. The fact that we have vigorous debate and discussion is undoubtedly a good thing because you can\u2019t govern without discussion and sometimes even vigorous ones. Do you think the one-party rubber stamp \u201cpeople\u2019s congress\u201d in China does any debate or defining ambiguities? My grandfather was on that and no, they didn\u2019t, and we\u2019re hopefully trying to avoid that, and the first step is to set out boundaries as to the basic terms being used. I don\u2019t know if the devs owe me any more tokens, I frankly don\u2019t know if they owe anyone any tokens. It is only a mere possibility, and only if the community decides on what is a user and what isn\u2019t a user. You\u2019ve stated earlier that you consider users to be those who used the front end but that\u2019s obviously not even supported by how the tokens were distributed. I\u2019m suggesting that we acknowledge the baseline parameters here:   \u201cUsage (noun)\u201d - this is a pretty simple one. I realize that not everybody\u2019s first language, including my own, defines this with the same nuance as and sometimes lack thereof in English, buit the devs have in some ways done that for us. The usage of uniswap means to interact with, via the front end or directly via the contracts, to complete, or prior to September 1, 2020, to attempt to complete some sort of a swap or liquidity add/removal act, by a user\u2019s actions, at the very least. The devs don\u2019t use the word usage itself I believe but because \u201cuse\u201d can be a verb and a noun in English, this should also refer to any time \u201cuse\u201d is used as a noun. And to use something, it\u2019s a sentence that at least requires a subject, and in this case an object as well.   \u201cUser\u201d - this is less simple. Firstly, since linking natural persons to addresess or contracts is self-defeating in this sense, a user is a contract or wallet, with the understanding that someone has control over it, that interacted with the uniswap contracts successfully in making swaps, adding/removing liquidity, or before September 1, have attempted to do so. Because you can\u2019t swap nothing for nothing, I think this should include an actual transfer of tokens/eth in the formulation. If you\u2019re not a user by the 1st of September, the current, outlined rules say that you\u2019re not included in the users that are eligible. That doesn\u2019t mean that in the future you don\u2019t count as a user, just for the current purpose.   Because that\u2019s where we are, the question left is \u201cwho, in their capacity in controlling funds/tokens in usage, constitute a user\u201d. Since we are only talking about cases where third party intermediaries of some sort acted as a middleman/proxy/front-end/etc really there are only a few potential options. And the options really are:   Some sort of strict liability - you didn\u2019t even know that Uniswap was a possibility and certainly made no conscious effort to choose it but the result is that the transaction was done with Uniswap got back to your wallet without you knowing through which means that was achieved.   (Possibly, still working this out) - some sort of at least in criminal and civil contexts in the US, a \u201crecklessness standard\u201d equivalent, as in you didn\u2019t intentionally choose to use Uniswap and but are aware of its possibility and was ambivalent about using it, and indeed in the transaction it was used and all was well and the transaction was completed.   Some sort of knowingly standard , as in you knew that uniswap was a choice and some part of the decision making process involved in you knowingly selecting a service that had Uniswap as an option, without selecting Uniswap itself over other services (for a Dex aggregator). The transaction happened and was completed through Uniswap.   Some sort of purposeful standard, where you went to some third party service, saw Uniswap, chose it specifically, and it was completed.   While this really should have been worked out by the devs (as they determined that failed transactions also count), I guess it\u2019s left to us. ",

This would mean that a user as defined by the announcement would require someone to not just incidentally or unknowningly interact with Uniswap without their knowledge but had at least some knowledge if not intent to participate in the process. That\u2019s a perfectly valid way of defining the boundaries. The nexus of control both in the transacting of the transaction in question as well as the target contract in the end would be require at least knowledge of the initiating person/code designed by a person. However I just want to note that just because someone is a DHARMA user does not make it mutually exclusive that they may have used Uniswap in some manner as well. It makes no sense to say \"they are Dharma users, they can\u2019t also be Uniswap users, just not in the transactions in question where they interacted with Dharma without having intended to do so with Uniswap.

I think it\u2019s rather cut-and-dry. I speak as someone who didn\u2019t receive an airdrop. Also, as a sidenote, I use Uniswap on my phone all the time through metamask, and it seamlessly works.

Uniswap LPs have benefited from the volume of activity through proxy interactions like Argent, Dharma etc. And in general, these apps have helped Uniswap to grow and succeed as much as any other interaction.   A new 5 million UNI drop would mean increasing the circulating supply by ~2%. A minimal potential impact to existing holders.   By nature of their focus on simplicity, Dharma and Argent are often someone\u2019s first foray into crypto. Many know nothing about airdrops, or the incredible ecosystem out there. The original UNI airdrop was quite miraculous for many people. Possibly life changing in some cases.   We have an opportunity to deepen the interest and commitment of thousands of people, both in Uniswap and in crypto. This seems worth it to me for the sake of bringing forward a 2% increase in circulating supply. I presume those voting against think they are being principled. But to me seem to want to deny something amazing to others that they themselves benefited from. ",

This is one of the risks of using a broker over handling your money directly, you are delegating some resource to a third-party (time, money, making certain decisions for you) in order to make it easier for you. The inherent risk remains that the proxy is the one really involved with the core system, and therefore have set themselves up in a position to act as a wall. Clearly, anyone who uses a proxy for anything is gaining something, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be using a proxy. When the proxy then receives a benefit from the third party they\u2019re mediating business with for you gets access to a reward, you\u2019re not entitled to it.

It is such a shame to see the amount of people who can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. The gift that was bestowed upon us simply by virtue of UNI Gov being created is enormous. A team bootstrapped the largest DeFi project on Earth and then willingly gave up custody of it\u2019s governance to the masses. There should by no means be any expectation that the system works in a way you deem fair. There\u2019s no way a perfect protocol could have been implemented from the start, it is meant to grow organically. Please check yourself at the door and consider that you\u2019re on the ground floor of a single part of the largest paradigm shift in finance history. Attitudes like this are entitled, short-sighted, and impatient. We can quite literally evolve this system into anything we want. Any feature that didn\u2019t work as planned, rules that are arbitrary or outdated, even the contracts that run the system; with time we as a group can change things in a way that is more agile and less congested than traditional governance and voting models. But it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, and it\u2019s certainly not going to fix bugs, greed, \u201cfairness\u201d, or the list of other things complaining voices can\u2019t stop going on about. If you\u2019ve considered all this, and still don\u2019t have faith in the system, do the community a favor while removing a big stressor from your life at the same time and find a good price to sell your UNI at. Because at the end of the day, regardless of how altruistic anyone says they are, the goal here is to make money. Plain and simple. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t strive for a more inclusive and frictionless way to make money that can meet the specific demands of the people using/governing Uniswap, but it does mean that the community members doing the work need to be able to put this entire operation into perspective; otherwise we\u2019re going to end up dragging the same problems from the old systems with us and ruin what would have otherwise been a perfect template for how we define and utilize value in this world. If you decide that you want to make this system which is barely even in it\u2019s infancy better:  Take one large dose of reality, a light brushing of Game Theory, a dash of Social Engineering (to taste), large helping of Governing Dynamics, and one extremely open mind.  Change takes time, effort, and the ability to put your pride and ego to the side. It\u2019s very much worth it. ",
