                    "content": " 1123\u00d7535 25.5 KB  From various posts and discord discussions, there appear to be several confusions and misunderstandings remaining around MIP65. We have therefore started this FAQ and hope to keep it updated and be convenient reference point.  Q: WHO IS THE OWNER/CONTROLLER OF THE MIP65 RELATED ASSETS AND THE JAMES ASSET TRUST STRUCTURE ?  A: MAKER GOVERNANCE EXCLUSIVELY CONTROL THE JAMES ASSET STRUCTURE AND THE MIP65 ASSETS   A common misconception is that Monetalis control James Asset Trust - this is not so. Monetalis is not the Owner, Manager or Controller of the James Asset Trust structure. Monetalis is, at this stage, the Reporting Agent for the James Asset structure to monitor the health of the trust structure for Maker.   Monetalis have been - and will only be - acting in the capactity of an Arranger for Maker - with duties and responsibilities as being defined in MIP105: The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework   The Maker governance process, exclusively, through Instructions to the Trustee, directs the James Asset Trust actions and actions on assets.   In fact, anyone in the community can write an instruction (following the templates from the MIP65 HQ) and propose for a governance vote.   These and other key aspects of the Trust structure can be found here: MIP65 Monetalis Clydesdale Documentation HQ The legal assessment of the structure can be found here: [RWA 007] MIP65 Monetalis/Clydesdale Legal Assessment  Q: WILL IT TAKE WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS TO LIQUIDATE MIP65 ?  A: NO\u2026WITH A VERY HIGH-DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IT SHOULD TAKE BETWEEN 2 to 3 BUSINESS DAYS AND UP TO ONE WEEK FROM MAKER GOVERNANCE INSTRUCTING THE TRUSTEE.   In case the Maker community decides to execute a partial or full redemption of its current positions on the MIP65 portfolio via Executive poll, upon receiving the respective instruction from the Trustee, Sygnum Bank will proceed with the execution of the trade order along with its different liquidity providers, expecting this to be executed and settled - hence USD credited back to James Asset Trust bank account at Sygnum within 1 business day (as ETFs have t+1 dealing cycle by default) in case of normal market conditions and potentially maximum of 2 business days in case of stressed market circumstances (such as unusual low liquidity in the markets).   A business day is counted as long as the trade order is given before the cut-off time for USD payment, hence approximately 12.00 CET, so the USD funds are accordingly transferred to Coinbase for the respective exchange for USDC on the same day.   As funds arrive with Coinbase they are exchanged to USDC and sent to the CES developed smart-contract for returning capital to Maker. This would also happen within 1 business day.   Please note the set of ETF products acquired are recognized for having one of the highest asset-bases and liquidity profiles among the BlackRock product range (with USD 9.48 and 8.42 billion in assets) ensuring a possible liquidation with limited to none impact to the NAV or spread of the trade order thanks to multiple levels of liquidity (normal ETF trade volumes, direct redemption, and its own warehousing capacity) therefore the likelihood of a locked-up market is highly unlikely.    Q: DO WE HAVE EXPLICIT PROOF OF MIP65 BEING ABLE TO LIQUIDATE IN LARGE 100M+ VOLUMES ?  A: NO\u2026BUT IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY MIP65 CAN. NOTE: IF THE MAKER COMMUNITY BELIEVES THE COST/BENEFIT OF DOING SO IS APPROPRIATE, A LARGE SCALE TEST CAN BE UNDERTAKEN   As part of the setup of the MIP65 structure an end-to-end redemption test was conducted for USD 50K. This executed smoothly with the funds being sent back to the vault with no difficulty. No further payments have been made to the vault or surplus buffer.   In any case, it is important to note that, as part of MIP65 deployment, several purchase trade orders in the range of USD 50-100 million were given to Bank Sygnum for execution all being processed in maximum 1 business days (even same day in majority of cases), which would follow the same procedure as for a redemption only that in the reverse direction. Similarly large scale exchanges between USDC and USD were transacted within a day with Coinbase.    Q: WHAT ARE THE MARKET VALUE RISKS IN MIP65 ?  A: INTEREST RATE CHANGES (MOVEMENTS ON THE YIELD CURVE)  CHANGES MARKET-VALUE: 1% INTEREST RATE MOVEMENT WILL LEAD TO AN INVERSE ~1% MOVEMENT IN MIP65 MARKET-VALUE.  The statistics for January 2023 for the two ETF products held under MIP65 look as follows:       W. Avg YTM W. Avg Maturity Effective Duration MV (USD)     iShares $ Treasury 0-1yr 4.45% 0.36y 0.35 350   iShares $ Treasury 1-3yr 4.26% 1.9y 1.83 152      Very simply, if the interest rate goes up, today\u2019s value of the underlying cash flow from the US treasuries goes down, and thus the market-value of the ETF goes down. And vice versa.   The level of interest rate sensitivity is measured by Effective Duration. It, equally simply, means that should the interest rate go up by 1%, then the value of the 0-1y ETF would roughly (roughly as markets never completely match the math) go down by 0.35% and for the 1-3y ETF by 1.83%. If you weigh the Effective Duration by current market value you get 0.8 - i.e. 1% movement in interest rate can roughly be seen to produce less than 1% movement in market value.   The short-term treasuries were deliberately chosen to ensure limited interest rate sensitivity in market-value and as simple as possible access to short-term US Treasury yield.   ",

Monetalis is not the Owner, Manager or Controller of the James Asset Trust structure. Monetalis is, at this stage, the Reporting Agent for the James Asset structure to monitor the health of the trust structure for Maker.   The confusion arises from the fact that the JAT (James Asset Trust) and JAL (James Asset Ltd) appear to be operating independently of Maker governance. It suddenly appeared in the midst of MIP81, complete with a legal review, which has since been withdrawn. There also appears to be an onboarding of one or both of these entities at Gemini, also unbeknownst to Maker governance:  If Monetalis is not acting in any sort of capacity besides attestations and reporting, how is it that JAL and JAT are becoming involved in unauthorized relationships? At the very least, the onboarding process at Gemini surely requires someone from an organization with legal authority \u2013 they would not let you create an account for someone for whom you were not authorized.     Allan_Pedersen:  The Maker governance process, exclusively, through Instructions to the Trustee, directs the James Asset Trust actions and actions on assets.   What about James Asset (PTC) Limited? Thank you in advance for clarification on the above. ",

                    "content": "Hi @GFXlabs Understood - let me try to clarify. a) The James Asset Structure was suggested as the potential legal counterpart for MIP81 execution as it already was onboarded with Coinbase as client - so it was evaluated for whether this would be possible. The structure did not do anything - it was a simple evaluation of its fit with the execution requirements. b) James Asset (PTC) Limited is the Trustee for James Asset Trust. The Trustee is run by SHRM as director (elected by MKR governance also). The Trustee has the ability to be onboard with services for the purpose of providing services to the James Asset Trust - but cannot transact any funds or pay for any services without governance instructions of course. In an effort to actually be more useful for Maker, the Trustee onboarded with Gemini for the purpose of ensuring a path of redemption was available for GUSD - should this ever be required - as the vote and situation around Gemini appeared challenging. Of course Monetalis was happy to help ensure this was done correctly as we monitor the health of the trust structure. c) If the Maker community decides the Trustee should not be able to onboard with services without going through an explicit Maker vote, then we just need to send an instruction to them saying so. Please note that they have no ability to move funds around anywhere without explicit Maker governance instructions and the several layers of fund control in the structure (ie. fund administrator sign-off, etc).

Of course Monetalis was happy to help ensure this was done correctly as we monitor the health of the trust structure.   In our experience, it\u2019s unusual for a trustee to proactively make a business decision without explicit authorization or direction to do so. Just so we\u2019re all on the same page, SHRM (the director for James Asset Limited) chose to actively initiate a new business relationship without communication with or authorization from MakerDAO? It would be surprising to know that SHRM is actively monitoring pending polls enough to even have been aware of the GUSD vote, and it is even more surprising that they would \u2013 without direction from MakerDAO \u2013 begin to respond to a presumed outcome of that poll. For clarity, who made SHRM aware of the Gemini vote and who directed SHRM to initiate onboarding at Gemini if they did not actively and of their own accord choose to do so? The whole situation suggests something in this structure needs to be tightened up to bring it under closer governance control and oversight. ",

We believe this to be good risk management - it would be a disaster if the trust couldn\u2019t liquidate into crypto because its onboarded exchange blew up. Gemini recently came naturally to the top of that list as it seemed to have self-evident additional benefits to Maker. We can\u2019t direct the Trustee any which way - we can just propose how they best use the few powers they retain to benefit Maker and keep the trust healthy and able to conduct the services Maker would expect from it.
