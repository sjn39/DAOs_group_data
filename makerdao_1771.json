Introduction Changing Market Conditions Revisiting the rETH Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation Summary & New Recommendations   Introduction The original Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation was published on May 20, 2022. Since then, a number of things have changed in MakerDAO and in the broader cryptoasset ecosystem. The objective of this post is to: (i) revisit the rETH risk assessment, (ii) update relevant metrics, and (iii) see if any adjustments to the original rETH risk parameter recommendations need to be made before the mainnet execution of rETH as Maker collateral. Further context on the developments of the onboarding process for rETH is available in the links below.  [rETH] MIP6 Collateral Application (Mar 7, 2021) [rETH] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment (Jan 27, 2022) [rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation (May 20, 2022) MIP10c3-SP22 Proposal: rETH Oracle (Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment) (Jun 2, 2022) rETH Assesment Update (Aug 11, 2022)   Changing Market Conditions The recent market downturn, other relevant events, and the subsequent impact on the Maker Protocol have been covered in detail in the May, June, July, and August parameter changes proposals from the MOMC.  ETH and rETH Price Changes Since the publication of the rETH collateral onboarding risk evaluation, the USD-denominated price is down -34.24% for ETH and -32.94% for rETH.  Chart1200\u00d7742 56.3 KB  Source: CoinGecko (ETH & rETH)  Stability Fee Changes in MakerDAO The table below lists all relevant stability fee changes to MakerDAO\u2019s ETH and Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) collateral types, from May 20, 2022, to September 23, 2022.  1600\u00d7457 93.3 KB  WSTETH-A acts as a good proxy for determining and setting the stability fee of rETH. When the original [rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation was published, the stability fee recommendation was 2.25%, the same as WSTETH-A at the time. To align rETH with WSTETH-A, the @Risk-Core-Unit believes that it is relevant to adjust the original stability fee recommendation to reflect these changes. It is therefore recommended that the stability fee of rETH is lowered by 0.75%, from 2.25% to 1.5%, at the time of mainnet implementation.  Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates There are now on average 15 unique taker addresses settling auctions. In addition, the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit has improved the accessibility of auction participation. In response to these changes and opportunities, the @Risk-Core-Unit recently proposed adjusting Maker\u2019s auction parameters for 14 different collateral types, with the objective of increasing auction throughput and in turn decreasing the market risk of liquidatable collateral. The proposed changes to WSTETH-A are the following:  Decrease buf by 0.1, from 1.2 to 1.1 Increase cusp by 0.05, from 0.4 to 0.45 Decrease tail by 20 minutes (1200 seconds) from 140 minutes (8,400 seconds) to 120 minutes (7,200 seconds) Decrease the tip by 50 DAI, from 300 DAI to 250 DAI  To create parity with WSTETH-A, it is recommended that Maker governance adjusts the same parameter values for rETH. To learn more, refer to Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates - September 2022.  Revisiting the rETH Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation  rETH in the Rocket Pool Deposit Pool The Rocket Pool core team has previously suggested that the Deposit Pool can provide a source of liquidity with no trade slippage. At the time of the original rETH risk assessment, this was taken into account to determine the available liquidity for rETH. However, according to Rocket Scan, the deposit pool has been nearly empty since May 10, 2022. The lack of ETH in the deposit pool suggests that it should not be treated as a reliable source of liquidity and hence should not be included in the equation of aggregate rETH liquidity.  1076\u00d7516 129 KB  Source: RocketScan  Token Deposits on Trading Venues In the original rETH risk assessment, Curve, Uniswap and Balancer were identified as the DeFi protocols on Ethereum L1 holding the greatest number of rETH token deposits in ETH-related trading pairs. The two chart below illustrates the approximate change in rETH deposits (left) and wstETH & ETH (right) on each respective platform.  1600\u00d7495 174 KB  Source: Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, and CoinGecko It is noticeable that Curve has demonstrated the largest decrease in rETH deposits. Liquidity on Balancer, however, has improved. A liquidity incentive proposal that included the rETH/wETH pool passed on July 3, 2022. The Balancer rETH Stable Pool now receives incentivised rewards. The amount of liquidity on Uniswap v3, on the other hand, is still negligible relative to the other protocols. It is worth reiterating that the rETH-wstETH Pool on Curve is designed to maintain an approximate ratio of 77/23 rETH-wstETH. It is therefore important to examine the aggregate change of both rETH and ETH-related assets across all relevant platforms. For the purpose of comparison, the chart below illustrates the approximate change of token deposits, assigning both wstETH and ETH to the same category.  Chart1200\u00d7742 25.9 KB  Source: Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, and CoinGecko The number of rETH deposits has decreased considerably as a result of the unbalanced 77/23 ratio of the Curve rETH-wstETH Pool. The total ETH/wstETH liquidity has decreased slightly, however, the decrease in wstETH liquidity on Curve has in part been counterbalanced by the increase in WETH liquidity on Balancer and Uniswap. This means that the slippage from selling rETH has not been affected substantially. In fact, slippage on 1Inch has improved. This is further illustrated in the next section: \u201cOn-chain Price Slippage: rETH-WETH\u201d. Finally, regarding Uniswap liquidity, on May 16 2022, a proposal was made to incentivise liquidity on Uniswap V3 rETH pools. As a result, an expectation in the original rETH risk assessment was that rETH liquidity would improve in the short to medium term. While there are ongoing discussions (1, 2, 3) in the Rocket Pool Discord, it is still unclear when, or indeed if, the initiative, or a similar initiative, will be launched. The Risk Core Unit has a neutral view on this question. The decision is in the remit of the Rocket Pool core team and community. Nevertheless, at this point in time, it is worth pointing out that liquidity on Uniswap V3 is unlikely to rapidly increase without a liquidity incentivisation initiative.  On-chain Price Slippage: rETH-WETH The chart below illustrates the rETH liquidity and the potential slippage that would occur as a consequence of selling different amounts of rETH. The chart is an estimate of the on-chain rETH/WETH slippage measured by the 1Inch DEX aggregator. Slippage curves from three different dates are included: July 19, August 4, and September 19.  Chart1200\u00d7742 47.7 KB  Source: 1Inch The table below shows the approximate slippage rates at each respective date.  1600\u00d7572 169 KB  Source: 1Inch rETH slippage has improved from both July 19 and August 4. This is, in part, likely due to the following reasons:  The 1Inch routing system did not support the rETH/wstETH Curve pool until August 2, 2022. Only Uniswap V3 and Balancer V2 were included. After including the rETH/wstETH pool, the slippage improved. Improvement in stETH price. rETH to ETH trades using the rETH/wstETH Curve Pool would need to go from rETH to wstETH to ETH through the stETH/ETH Curve Pool. Such a trade could have caused more slippage when the stETH/ETH pool was heavily unbalanced. The stETH/ETH pool is now more balanced, which implies less slippage. Liquidity has improved on Balancer.  As a result, the 1Inch routing system primarily uses the rETH/wstETH Curve pool and Balancer to achieve lower slippage.  Summary & New Recommendations When the original rETH risk evaluation was published, it was the Risk Core Unit\u2019s assessment that there was adequate rETH liquidity to justify a 5 million DAI debt ceiling. At the same time, in the short to medium term, liquidity was expected to increase. In the interim period, rETH liquidity decreased considerably, followed by a subsequent increase in liquidity. There is still a possibility that other Core Units identify potential issues that warrant a lower initial debt ceiling. However, from a liquidity point of view, the initial debt ceiling recommendation of 5 million does not need to be adjusted at this point in time. If liquidity does not improve further, the probability of the @Risk-Core-Unit or the MOMC recommending a higher debt ceiling is very low, and hence the potential for higher revenues, while keeping the protocol safe, is limited. If the 5 million debt ceiling is reached, the protocol revenue will be $75,000 per year. Almost all ETH and Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) collateral types have experienced a decrease in stability fees (SF) since the original rETH assessment. WSTETH-A serves as a good proxy for determining the stability fee for rETH. Therefore, it is recommended that the rETH stability fee is lowered by 0.75%, from 2.25% to 1.5%, at the time of mainnet implementation. Finally, it is recommended that the buf, cusp, tail, and tip parameters are changed before the mainnet launch to match the proposed changes from the Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates - September 2022 post. The exact changes are available in the list below. In summary, the @Risk-Core-Unit recommends the following parameter changes to rETH before mainnet launch:  Decrease Stability Fee by 0.75%, from 2.25% to 1.5% Decrease Buf by 0.1, from 1.2 to 1.1 Increase Cusp by 0.05, from 0.4 to 0.45 Decrease Tail by 20 minutes (1200 seconds) from 140 minutes (8,400 seconds) to 120 minutes (7,200 seconds) Decrease the Tip by 50 DAI, from 300 DAI to 250 DAI  Going forward, the MOMC will continue to assess rETH activity to see if any additional parameter changes need to be made.

First, I wanted to say I\u2019m very pleased to see this moving forward, and I appreciate that we are getting an improved stability fee to match wstETH.  There are a two points from the analysis I\u2019d like to touch on, if only for the future.  Curve liquidity Reducing our dependence on liquidity through wstETH was a goal for us. When wstETH depegged heavily earlier in the bear market, people LPing on rETH/wstETH took a significant hit as they were used as exit liquidity. As a result we have not incentivized that pool, even though it\u2019s cheaper to incentivize than an ETH pool. We only have a few data points, but here\u2019s some numbers according to the routing reported by 1inch:     Date % through wstETH (rETH-> ETH) % through wstETH (ETH-> rETH)     8/28 30% 30%   9/16 20% 10%   9/24 10% 10%     Liquidity and the peg For Maker, liquidity is important when an asset drops in value. I\u2019d like to note that our our peg has performed significantly better (see this community-created dune query), even through a sustained down market. While I fully acknowledge that the initial depeg was (A) caused by market context and (B) greater for wstETH due to leverage, that does not explain the persistently better peg performance across months. The market apparently views rETH as being valued more closely to the value of its backing. I won\u2019t speculate as to why the market believes this, but I will highlight that this belief translates directly into a lower probability of liquidation. Obviously, there can\u2019t be a liquidation for a loss without a liquidation, so this should be a benefit for Maker. ",

The project spun out of ConsenSys in 2017. Since then, several applications, spin-offs, and projects have been built by the Gnosis team and community. These include (i) Omen - prediction markets, (ii) Gnosis Safe - fund management tooling, and (iii) Cow Protocol - a permissionless DEX. More recently, two developments have come to form the core of the Gnosis ecosystem: (i) the GnosisDAO, and (ii) the Gnosis Chain (GC). The GnosisDAO was announced in November 2020. When GnosisDAO was initiated, the Gnosis Ltd. company transferred a majority of its funds to the GnosisDAO treasury. At the time of writing, the GnosisDAO treasury is worth approximately $166 million. One key reason for creating the GnosisDAO was to give GNO holders a voice in the decision-making process regarding products, development, support, governance, and treasury management.  Tokenomics The GNO token was introduced during Gnosis\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. The Gnosis team raised 250,000 ETH (at the time approximately $12.5 million) by selling 418,777 GNO (approximately 4.2% of the total supply). Today, the GNO token serves two key functions in the Gnosis ecosystem.   Governance token for GnosisDAO: GNO token holders are able to vote on Gnosis Improvement Proposals (GIPs) and other governance votes on Snapshot in Phase 3 of a Gnosis governance proposal (more on the Governance process and Snapshot below in the \u201cGovernance\u201d section). To vote on a GnosisDAO Snapshot poll, at least 1 GNO is needed.  Staking token for the Gnosis Chain (GC): GNO can be staked on the Gnosis Chain to secure the Gnosis validating blocks as part of its Proof-of-Stake consensus. Similar to Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake architecture, GNO holders can choose to run their own infrastructure (requiring 1 GNO per validator) or stake through a liquid staking alternative. It is worth noting that Gnosis Chain still uses Parity\u2019s AuRa (Authority Round) Proof-of-Authority consensus model, but will soon undergo a similar \u201cmerge\u201d event to the Ethereum merge. The estimated merge date is December 5, 2022. In effect, this means that Gnosis Chain will switch from Proof-of-Authority to Proof-of-Stake.   Governance  GnosisDAO and Gnosis Ltd Gnosis Ltd. is a company based in Gibraltar. According to the GIP10: GnosisDAO Participation Agreement (June 2021) the contribution of Gnosis Ltd to GnosisDAO is limited to the following:  the provision of the open-sourced Foundational Code of the GnosisDAO; the initial transfer of the GNO besting contract with Public Address 0xeC83f750adfe0e52A8b0DbA6eeB6be5Ba0beE535 to the GnosisDAO; the initial funding of the GnosisDAO; and a relationship of collaboration with the GnosisDAO as a Service Provider.  GnosisDAO, on the other hand, can be seen as the entity in which GNO holders can voice their opinions and vote on outcomes related to Gnosis products, developments, and treasury management.  GnosisDAO Voting Categories The pie chart below categorises GIP-1 to GIP-70 in order to identify which items the GnosisDAO generally votes on. \u201cFunding\u201d is the most common Gnosis Improvement Proposal (GIP). Examples include (i) GIP-38, (ii) GIP-36, and (iii) GIP-50. The second most frequent category is \u201cTreasury Management\u201d. Examples include (i) GIP-46 and (ii) GIP-33. The third most frequent category is \u201cGovernance Altering\u201d. GIPs in this category include (i) GIP-3, (ii) GIP-10, and (iii) GIP-11.  Chart1200\u00d7742 42.2 KB  Source: Snapshot - GnosisDAO  GnosisDAO Governance Process The GnosisDAO governance process is made up of three phases. For a governance proposal to be accepted by the DAO, it must first successfully pass through all three phases.   Phase 1 - Ideation: A post is created on the Gnosis Forum under the GnosisDAO category. The duration of phase 1 is open-ended. In addition, phase 1 does not have a formal requirement for passing to phase 2.  Phase 2 - Specification: The proposal is made into a Gnosis Improvement Proposal (GIP) in the form of a forum poll. See the GIP Template for more information. The duration of a GIP vote is 5 days. The proposal will not pass to phase 3 if it is voted down through the forum poll GIP.  Phase 3 - Consensus: Finally, in the third phase, a GnosisDAO Snapshot poll is created. The duration of phase 3 on Snapshot must be at least 7 days. For a proposal to pass phase 3, a relative majority of the GNO that is voting must vote for the desired outcome. In addition, there must be a yes-voting quorum of a minimum of 4% of the circulating supply of GNO.  It is important to note that if GNO is onboarded as Maker collateral, MakerDAO may be more impacted by GnosisDAO governance decisions. This is especially the case as MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO Agreement sets out a number of commitments that might result in more interwoven governance processes. In order to mitigate associated governance risks that may occur as a result of the agreement, the MakerDAO community, and the Risk Core Unit, in particular, will need to monitor Gnosis governance discussions and GIPs in detail going forward. The Gnosis three phase governance process (as set out above) suggests that the GnosisDAO voting duration is set at a minimum of 12 days. Hence, any governance risks can be minimized by engaging with the GnosisDAO community and expressing any concerns before GIPs are put up for vote.  GnosisDAO Multisig GnosisDAO utilises a Safe multisig contract with the public address: 0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe. The contract has a 3/5 signers threshold. According to the GIP10: GnosisDAO Participation Agreement, the signers of the GnosisDAO multisig may veto a passed GIP in the case of \u201cForce Majeure\u201d as determined at their sole discretion. This may pose a threat to the GnosisDAO governance process in case the multisig signers turn malicious.  GnosisDAO Daughter Safe and the Zodiac Roles Modifier Karpatkey is a DeFi fund management organisation that focuses on helping clients grow their funds through DeFi yield strategies. Karpatkey was initially incubated through Gnosis Ltd. and tasked to grow Gnosis Ltd.\u2019s treasury. Following GIP-20 in January 2022, Karpatkey started offering similar services to GnosisDAO, including research, execution and reporting of GnosisDAO treasury management activities. At the time of writing, Karpatkey helps manage GnosisDAO\u2019s treasury through the Gnosis Daughter Safe. The Daughter Safe has a 3/10 signer threshold. According to GIP-20, two of these signers are Karpatkey owned wallets. All 5 GnosisDAO signers are also part of the Gnosis Daughter Safe. In addition, the GnosisDAO has admin access.  Gnosis Chain: On-chain Fundamentals Following GIP-16, in November 2021, the Gnosis and xDAI communities decided to merge their tokens to develop the xDAI Blockchain under the name \u201cGnosis Chain\u201d. The Gnosis Chain (GC) utilizes a dual-token design. The GNO token is used to participate in the network\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The xDAI token is used as the native currency for paying for gas. xDAI is bridged DAI from the Ethereum mainnet, which gets generated when DAI is sent to the xDAI bridge. According to DeFiLlama and @maxaleks / xDai Bridge Dune dashboard, DAI is the dominant stablecoin of the Gnosis Chain, with 54.76% of all stablecoin activity denominated in DAI ($32 million). This can be explained by the fact that Gnosis Chain uses xDAI as the native currency for paying transaction fees.  Active Addresses Over Time The chart below illustrates the daily active addresses from the time of the rebranding until the time of writing. The metric serves as a good proxy for measuring the usage of the Gnosis Chain.  Chart1200\u00d7742 58.2 KB  Source: GnosisScan - Daily Active Addresses  Projects on Gnosis Chain (GC) According to DeFiLlama data, the total value locked in the Gnosis Chain is currently circa $56.9 million. The chart below illustrates the Gnosis Chain TVL change over time, dating back to March 2021. The largest project by TVL is at the time of writing Curve Finance ($15m; 26.2%). The second largest is Swapr ($9.16m; 16%).  Chart1274\u00d7812 140 KB  Source: DeFiLlama  Native Bridges According to the Gnosis Chain Docs, the Gnosis Chain has two native bridges:   xDAI Bridge: A native Dai bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI. According to @maxaleks xDai Bridge Dune dashboard, there is currently 32 million DAI locked in the xDAI bridge.  Omnibridge: Mints bridged tokens using a variant of the ERC-677 token standard.  The current native Gnosis Chain bridge architectures are based on a multisig design, which has known weaknesses and reliance on centralized actors. Multisig-based bridge design has in other projects led to serious hacks and loss of funds. Previous hacks include (i) Ronin bridge and (ii) Harmony bridge. Stakeholders who currently act as Ethereum <-> Gnosis bridge validators are (i) GnosisDAO, (ii) Protofire, (iii) CowProtocol, (iv) Giveth, (v) GnosisSafe, and (vi) Syncnode. It is worth noting that GnosisDAO, 0xPARC, and Succinct are working towards a new, trust-minimized, bridge design, where Gnosis Chain validators will secure the bridge to Ethereum by running a light client of GC on Ethereum using zkSNARK. In addition, as an alternative solution, the original xDai team is working on a BLS-signature based trustless bridge.  Consensus Model At the time of writing, Gnosis Chain is utilizing Parity\u2019s AuRa proof-of-authority consensus model. Gnosis Chain plans to undergo a similar \u201cmerge\u201d to that of Ethereum. The hardfork will replace the current Proof-of-Authority system with a Proof-of-Stake system. This will lead to a larger and more diverse validator set on the Gnosis Chain. The initial plan was to do this 1 week before the Ethereum merge. However, the Gnosis Chain merge has been delayed until the estimated date of December 5, 2022. The Chiado testnet successfully merged on November 4, 2022. Planned key upgrades that will follow the Gnosis Chain merge include (i) enabling GNO staking withdrawals and (ii) deploying a trustless ETH GC bridge. According to the Beacon Gnosis Chain Explorer and @maxaleks Dune dashboard, there are currently 108,847 active validators spread across 919 unique depositors on the Gnosis Beacon Chain. At current GNO prices, approximately $10 million has so far been deposited.  The GNO Token: Metrics and Analysis  Holders Distribution & Supply Change According to Etherscan data, the number of active addresses holding GNO on the Ethereum mainnet is 16,092. The total token supply of GNO was initially set to 10 million (shown in the pie chart below on the left). However, with GIP-35, which passed in May 2022, the GnosisDAO community decided to lock and burn the remaining vesting amount (enforced by contracts), resulting in a total GNO supply of 3 million (shown in the pie chart below on the right). At current GNO prices ($89.49), the implied FDV of GNO is approximately $268 million.  1600\u00d7387 188 KB  Source: Etherscan - Gnosis Token Holders  Token Deposits on Trading Venues The chart below illustrates the exchanges holding the most amount of GNO tokens, according to Nansen data. Subtracting the Vesting Contract amount (see \u201cHolders Distribution & Supply Change\u201d section above), the implied amount of GNO tokens on exchanges is 10.45% of the total supply (circa 313k GNO). At the time of writing, 313k GNO tokens are worth approximately $28 million. GNO on-chain liquidity is higher compared to centralised alternatives. Uniswap and Balancer together hold circa 218k GNO tokens ($19.5 million; 69% of all GNO available on exchanges).  Chart1198\u00d7742 43 KB  Source: Nansen The chart below looks closer at the available on-chain liquidity in Uniswap and Balancer. There are two pools with relevant amounts of liquidity: (i) Balancer 80 GNO 20 WETH, (ii) Uniswap v3: GNO-WETH (0.3%). These pools contain a total of $7.26 million WETH and $15 million GNO.

Chart1200\u00d7742 22.1 KB  Source: CoinGecko and CoinMetrics  GnosisDAO MCD Vault Management According to the MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO Agreement, three key commitments from GnosisDAO need to be met.  Remain an active MCD vault user with decentralized highly liquid assets including ETH and its liquid staking derivatives available as collateral. Maintain no less than 75% of GnosisDAO stablecoin borrowing activities with highly liquid assets excluding possible recursive farming activity in lending markets in MCD. GnosisDAO will conduct the majority of its stablecoin borrowing volume with Maker. Utilize the GNO-A debt ceiling as soon as possible, Maker prefers the majority of available debt ceiling to be utilized at all times.  In regards to the two first points, the two charts below take a closer look at GnosisDAO\u2019s WSTETH position on MakerDAO. The WSTETH position was first opened in January 2022. GnosisDAO has been able to maintain a healthy collateralisation ratio since then.  1600\u00d7915 199 KB  Source: Block Analitica - Maker Risk Dashboard The protection score has stayed between medium and low since the inception of the vault position in January 2022. For a Low Risk vault that means being protected against a 66% price drop (3x current LR) and for a Medium Risk vault to be protected against a 33% price drop (1.5x current LR). To learn more about the protection score metric, refer to the Maker Vault Protection Score post on the Maker Forum.  1600\u00d7400 50.3 KB  Source: Block Analitica - Maker Risk Dashboard  Parameter Argumentation, Specific Risk Mitigation and Purpose of GNO-A onboarding The synergy between MakerDAO and GnosisDAO suggests there is a reasonable potential for further collaborative initiatives. GnosisDAO is one of the largest borrowers in MCD which is a strong basis for ongoing future collaboration. GnosisDAO is a large facilitator of DAI demand and they are introducing new retail users to DAI. Because Gnosis Chain (GC) is using DAI as a network-fee asset, every new user of the GC also becomes a DAI holder and MakerDAO user. The GNO asset is also consistent with the Endgame directive, as there will likely be a MetaDAO or a Cluster which can adopt this vault type at a later time. Regarding the GNO-A vault, it is important to note that we anticipate that the only vault owner will be the GnosisDAO treasury management team themselves, fully utilizing the available debt ceiling. Compared to other assets available in the Maker Protocol, the extraordinarily high collateralization requirement of GNO-A makes it an unattractive alternative to normal users. Hence, even if there would be available DAI to draw, it is unlikely that normal users would make use of it. Out of all entities that have exposure towards GNO, the GnosisDAO is the most incentivised to ensure its future prosperity. Hence, any exploit, such as price manipulation, originating in GNO-A, would cause extreme reputational damage to the Gnosis community. Furthermore, the collaboration agreement could have been an institutional vault. However, this approach, with a combination of unique parameters in a public vault type and the informal agreement between the two DAOs with synergistic incentives, is much leaner and faster to implement. The dust parameter is therefore set very high - 100k DAI, to further disincentive retail users for using the vault type. The main specific economic risks to GNO are both related to low liquidity on-chain and in CEX trading venues. The on-chain liquidity is problematic in case of liquidation events, while CEX liquidity is most problematic as it presents risks related to oracle price manipulation and possible exploits. We believe that with a unique set of parameters and how this public vault type is intended to be used, based on the aforementioned agreement, the specific risks are largely mitigated. The first line of protection is an unusually high liquidation ratio (LR) of 350%. Assuming the positions get below 350% and are liquidated, the price would still need to drop an additional ~71.4% before Maker is impacted by bad debt. Because the collateralization requirement is so high, in case of an upwards price oracle manipulation attempt, the attacker would need to significantly increase the price across different venues and maintain that price for a significant amount of time in order to exploit the situation. The upwards price manipulation attack is obviously not possible in the case where the debt ceiling is fully utilized, which we anticipate to be the case. Another possible attack vector with oracle manipulation is where the attacker would borrow GNO on some venue (e.g. Aave), sell into the market to the point where GNO-A vaults are liquidated, and then repurchase the GNO in auction and repay the debt. Due to the current state of liquidity sources, we believe this attack is very niche and improbable. In addition, our collateral auction parameters provide additional protection, as the price in the auction would reset after reaching a certain discount. GnosisDAO has a large liquid treasury, which was a basis for selecting the liquidation ratio we are proposing. They publish weekly reports on the state of the portfolio and its activities, but the information can also be verified on-chain. As seen below, based on our very conservative estimation (excluding all assets except ETH-based assets and stablecoins), they hold more than 40% of value compared to the total market capitalization. While there is no mechanism to currently convert GNO for these assets, it does give a strong bottom level for a GNO valuation, it is highly improbable that it would trade below this value for a longer period of time.  In addition to the assets presented in the table above, Gnosis also holds other cryptoassets. For the purpose of this analysis, they were not included on the grounds that the analysis should be as conservative as possible. Given that at least 40% of GNO is \u201cbacked\u201d by ETH equivalents and that we require at least 160% collateralization for wstETH-A, the equivalent for GNO would therefore be 400%. We decided on 350%, as it is high enough in our opinion to mitigate the specific risks involved. In case GNO-A gets onboarded, the Risk Core Unit will regularly monitor GnosisDAO vault activities, their treasury, and compliance with the agreement. The information will be communicated with MOMC who will perform further ongoing vault parameter change proposals.  Summary of Notable Risks   Governance Risk: If GNO is onboarded as Maker collateral, MakerDAO may be more impacted by GnosisDAO governance decisions. This is especially the case as the MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO agreement sets out a number of commitments that might result in more interwoven governance processes. In order to mitigate any associated governance risks that may occur as a result of this agreement, the MakerDAO community, and the Risk Core Unit, in particular, will need to monitor Gnosis governance discussions and GIPs in detail going forward.  Centralised control of GnosisDAO: Gnosis Ltd has developed tools for DAOs to make voting and governance processes more efficient and decentralised. One such tool is the SafeSnap/Reality module. GnosisDAO utilized the SafeSnap module. However, they also use the GnosisDAO Multisig as a \u201dsafeguard\u201d. The signers of the GnosisDAO multisig may veto a passed GIP in the case of \u201cForce Majeure\u201d as determined at their sole discretion. This may pose a threat to the GnosisDAO governance process in case the multisig signers turn malicious.  Centralised control of GnosisDAI Treasury: Gnosis Daughter Safe signers may execute transactions that conflict with the agreed-upon terms and conditions in the MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO agreement.  Gnosis Chain Bridge Multisig Risk: The current native Gnosis Chain bridges use a multisig-based design. This is a suboptimal solution since funds can be lost in case the multisig is compromised. If the GNO token is added as collateral in Maker, the most direct risk in such an event would be a devaluation of GNO, which in turn may lead to liquidations in the Maker Protocol. Another potential risk would be a hack of DAI funds on the Gnosis Chain.  Liquidity Concerns: The GNO token is very illiquid both on-chain and on centralised trading venues. The on-chain liquidity is problematic in case of a liquidation event. However, according to the MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO agreement agreement, the intended counterparty for this particular vault type is supposed to be GnosisDAO (i.e. the GnosisDAO treasury). Hence,  GnosisDAO should have enough liquidity to safely manage its position. Low CEX liquidity is problematic as it presents risks related to oracle price manipulation and possible exploits. The liquidity concern has also been raised in the [GNO] Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment (MIP10c3-SP23): since the liquidity is so low for so many sources, it becomes much more feasible for an attacker to manipulate enough markets at the same time to execute an Oracle attack.  Execution risk of Gnosis Chain\u2019s Upgrade Path: The Gnosis Chain currently uses Proof-of-Authority, but will soon undergo a similar \u201cmerge\u201d event to the Ethereum merge that was successfully executed in September 2022. The estimated date for the Gnosis Chain merge is December 5, 2022. In effect, this means that Gnosis Chain will switch from Proof-of-Authority to Proof-of-Stake. Planned key upgrades that will follow the Gnosis Chain merge include (i) enabling GNO staking withdrawals and (ii) deploying a trustless ETH GC bridge. The GNO token is susceptible to price volatility if there is a crucial bug in either the merge or the planned upgrades following the Gnosis Chain merge.
