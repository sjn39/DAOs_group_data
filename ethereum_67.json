What is now the best practice to detect the altered transaction? Ideally the wallet would tell the dapp about the alteration - but AFAIK there is no such mechanism (yet). Otherwise what is a good way/best practice here? Searching through all transactions to find the replacement tx sounds like a lot of waste. Maybe I am missing something here - or should we bootstrap a mechanism that the wallet can tell the dapp about alterations? ",
