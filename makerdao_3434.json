But I also have to push back at least a little, because I think it\u2019s something that should still be considered, and perhaps there\u2019s a creative way to address it. Realistically, if someone is heavily indebted to Maker to the point it affects their finances more than their ownership of MKR ,and also sits on the committee that makes the official recommendations to the community about stability fees and debt ceilings and the line, that\u2019s just not a recipe for good governance. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if the MakerDAO version of the FOMC comes out with a recommendation, wouldn\u2019t you think most MKR holders will agree with what they propose, if only because those folks have been in the weeds and likely have more knowledge about the matter in real time. Catastrophic mistakes may present themselves immediately, but you still leave yourself open to corruption \u2013 which I think we\u2019d at least like to avoid the appearance of. Perhaps verifying stakes in vaults and MKR isn\u2019t the answer. But I think we need to have something in place to account for the fact that it can be really easy to put someone in a position where they have to choose between their own financial wellbeing in a very direct way and that of Maker. Even if these folks are 110% trustworthy, there will always be someone new in the future who can hop onto this committee \u2013 particularly if a history of agreeing with its recommendations develops. I just think we\u2019re setting ourselves up for some bad news bears down the road as soon as there\u2019s any turnover in this committee if this isn\u2019t thought about right now. ",

Essentially yes, in practice what happens is @Primoz provides risk premiums for everything, @monet-supply provides competitive analysis for everything, then we go through each asset and discuss changes we think we should make. In the future I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll have more of these groups appear, at which point we\u2019ll share the risk and competitive input but potentially end up with differing proposals based on the individual PPG\u2019s goals. One might focus on risk mitigation exclusively and push for reductions to lower stablecoin exposure for example. Another might favour maximizing protocol income and subsidizing risk. The goal there would be to have competing proposals be voted on based on the same data such that governance can choose based on their desired direction.     PaperImperium:  I just think we\u2019re setting ourselves up for some bad news bears down the road as soon as there\u2019s any turnover in this committee if this isn\u2019t thought about right now.   Any turnover would need to be clearly communicated, and part of MIP46 says the following:   The Parameter Proposal Group must publicize its members. Pseudonymous identities are acceptable but should have displayed activity in the community prior to the group\u2019s formation. It is suggested (but not required) that a Parameter Proposal Group consists of at least three individuals. - MIP46   It\u2019s more or less impossible to account for all the different ways a person could end up with diverging incentives. In my opinion the best we can do is:  Make sure that rationale is expressed and related back to PPG objectives, so that holes in logic can be addressed. Make sure there is time for debate so that proposals can be questioned. Make sure membership is public and there is a reputational component. Make sure members have at least considered their conflicts of interest by requiring them to list them. Make sure that MKR Holders sign-off on all proposals.  In principle I understand your point and the risks. But we have this risk everywhere, and the best we can do is mitigate it. Core Units could be bribed in the future to pursue outside agendas, MKR Holders could also be bribed to vote in certain directions, and PPG\u2019s could pursue their own interests in their proposals. The surest way to ensure alignment in a PPG or Core Unit is to force them to stake MKR in order to do the job. At this stage this doesn\u2019t seem feasible to me, it\u2019s too much of a downside / capital requirement. How much MKR is enough to ensure alignment for something like this? 1, 10, 100? Even just 1 MKR is ~$2000, that\u2019s a big capital requirement to provide input into a joint proposal once a month. This series from @Planet_X talks about how we could move to staking, and it\u2019s a very neat idea, and would allow a lot more throughput, but it\u2019s probably not feasible at this stage of growth / scale.

One of my chief complaints is the lack of discussion with the community. Observers would go a long way to dispelling the image of a \u201csmoke filled room.\u201d Remember: with only one PPG for rates, this closed meeting of a few individuals is deciding what the only candidate on a ballot will be. I think allowing known DAO members to sit in and listen is entirely appropriate. If nothing else, the actual information this PPG is working from is (I believe) required to be shared, even if the discussions amongst individual members are not. ",

Especially when I worry there\u2019s not a clear understanding of how DAI is currently generated, where our profits come from, and why we are differentiated from the likes of Aave and Compound.

But I would not have recommended a rate cut that pushes us to the point of unprofitability simply to target ~20% of DAI source. I am staggered at the unfamiliarity with our own user base. The PSM accounts for ~54% of our DAI, and ~30% comes from our five largest users. Of what remains, most is not from small yield farmers. We serve large DAI users, and we are where an institution can generate DAI without moving rates against themselves by their transaction size. We are not in the commodity lending business. Additionally, these cuts are in the face of rising revenue and an all-time high of supply, with the PSM\u2019s growth stalling. Even if you believed that unwinding billions in interest-free float that we can deploy for yield is a good goal, the trends are already more favorable. So the goal is to target a minority of our current usage base by driving profits out of our own system in order to compete with protocols that must pay their users in order to compete with us? It\u2019s madness. And then to push such a drastic change on-chain without even waiting for input from the DAO community?

Why are their opinions on whether Maker should even make or lose money more important than the decentralized autonomous organization they purport to serve?   the list of people in the MOMC is just at the beginning of this post. I know, reading is for suckers - but please:    [Signal Request] Repeal \"Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - June 28, 2021\"   I felt it was acceptable in this instance to expedite the process because:  Response to the previous PPG proposal did not feel that we had gone far enough with changes - and people were concerned that the delay was resulting in a lack of competitiveness and materially harming the protocol. The mandated actors had also discussed the idea of further rate reductions outside of the PPG and were broadly (though not entirely) in favour. It\u2019s possible that the mandated actors would have pushed something similar if the PPG hadn\u2019t. There was a signal request that commented on speeding up the process, to which I highlighted cutting down the discussion time as one of the optimisations to improve turnaround. Frankly, it felt like a workable idea, and I wanted to see what the response would be. Delays to the PPG turnaround have been highlighted multiple times in the past and we\u2019ve made no process change, again, it felt like it was worth attempting to lean in the other direction. The proposal is just that, a proposal. The PPG group does not have the power to implement anything. We expedited a proposal for a change, not the change itself. The 3 day weekly poll duration is not new, it\u2019s existed for multiple years. If larger MKR Holders felt that it was unsuitable, they have had years to change it. They haven\u2019t done so. Ultimately a number of MKR Holders were present and voted in the poll, others were not. If larger holders cannot check in once a week when they have literally hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, to see if there is something that concerns them even when directly prompted to do so, my sympathy is limited. The executive vote exists as a final backstop to prevent something passing if it is unpopular. Delaying CU budgets for a week is unfortunate and would cause some problems, but those problems can be worked around if people truly do not want this. Additionally, as you\u2019ve stated, there is nothing here that cannot be reversed. Downside is that governance looks a bit schizophrenic. Again, that\u2019s unfortunate, but maybe that encourages people to take the weekly poll processes more seriously.        PaperImperium:  Though it risks my own reputation to do so, I would be negligent to not point out that this small group of individuals \u2013 meeting behind closed doors, refusing observers, and pushing extremist policies into a vote without feedback as required by their own rules \u2013 is acting exactly like the centralized, power-hoarding financial system that everyone here seeks to escape.   pathetic! I have seen what happened to the second PPG, I would like to avoid to see something like this a second time.

Thank you for posting the links for future generations to get up to speed, though!   no. i am serious. go somewhere else, or do another post, or a campaign why people should not even consider the proposals by the MOMC. or open up a new PPG. i seriously do not care this thread is about updates on  who is in the PPG which parameters are covered are there any new conflicts of interest so basically facts and not opinions   but clearly not for this.

Objectives As real-world assets (RWA) are now live on MakerDAO, it makes sense to help Governance to reduce the RWA-related burden by having a dedicated committee to provide higher-level propositions to MakerDAO Governance. The RWA risk assessments are quite long (>20 pages) and technical. The RWA reports are also complex and can necessitate discussions to form an opinion. The Real-World Finance Core Unit tries to be factual and not give direct answers. Moreover, going forward, the stability fees (SF) of RWA might need to be changed in response to market rate changes or portfolio compositions. This will lead to many small-level decisions (and low impact for most) that could be heavy to be dealt with by Signal Requests. Therefore, the RWA Committee would bridge a gap between the low-level informations and the decision by digesting the RWF report and providing an actionable proposal to the MakerDAO Governance. The objectives of the committee are to reduce the governance burden and speed up the process.  Scope  Debt Ceiling for RWA Stability Fees for RWA Triggering of liquidations due to covenant breach or if DC is set to 0 Committee opinion regarding RWA collateral onboarding   Identity Identification: PPG-RWA-002 Informal name: MakerDAO RWA Committee (RWAC)  Members and Conflicts of Interest Current members (and declared conflict of interest) of the RWA Committee are:  @Planet_X @flipflopflapdelegate @prose11  @mrabino1 , significant RWA beneficiary with 6S Capital  @Akiva , owner of a project on hedge interest rate in DeFi @ultraschuppi  @g_dip , has a business to bring RWA to MakerDAO  @_LS , working at Centrifuge @Cmo @omahalawyer  @roollie , work for NAOS, has a current MIP6 application, as an asset manager, with PandaCredit and Centrifuge, and is looking forward to future applications. @Allan_Pedersen @DavidJeng  @Viktor_Viktorov1 involved in a current MIP6  Conflicts of Interests are stated by each individual by their own judgment. In case something is changing it will be updated in this thread. The Real-World Finance Core Unit (and any future RWA-related Core Unit) will be participating (if the RWA Committee agreed to) but without having a say in the committee proposal.  Consistency, Reactive and Cooperative The committee is going to meet at least once a month and publish a note and proposals regarding its scope in the MakerDAO forum. In case urgent changes are necessary, specific meetings and communication will be done. The committee will also be consulted on an ongoing basis by the RWA-related Core Unit for RWA-related matters. This committee is cooperative with other committees on the same scope. ",
