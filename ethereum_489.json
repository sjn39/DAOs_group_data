Long form discussion can / will still happen in forum \u2013 but updates / moving things forward / accountability in Github.  Participants Rhys Aidan TJ Rush Bryant  issuing invoices Brooke William Simona events - inclusivity Amy inclusivity Jordy interested in organization, reaching consensus on standards Andreas Kauri \u2013 getting to action scale and communicate, keep invluded ?? from St. Lucia coming from St. Lucia, populaton of 200K when I wanted to get involved in cc community, used localbitcoin I was the only user \u2013 throughout the Caribean and East Africa, same problems still exist   William  open Q&A \u2013 200 people about 20 got a chance to speak as groups get larger \u2013 80% stay quiet in first ring group \u2013 30min was intros point from Boris, Aidan \u2013 like Linux or Bitcoin IETF made some mistakes? Hit level of growth \u2013 costs of coordination, cause people pushed to the wayside if every single person has to have input, then each person is added \u2013 cost goes into coordination company called Gore \u2013 famous for making Goretex no managers \u2013 best place to work they found that there need to be small groups rather than large groups \u2013 by necessity  TJ Rush  when we will meet next? instead \u2013 push to regions  Bryant   started my own meetup in my own city   no one from community is at DevCon \u2013 I\u2019m representing that community   hierarchies of discussion   can continue to have larger discussions   Need better communication \u2013 out of in person, to online   Asynch communications   when do we want to meet? what goals do we want to succeed?   succesful rings did pre-work to move forward   others, for alignment in the room very valuable   more onus to do pre-work   lot of rework \u2013 tackle the same issue, with a slightly different angle   trying to claim attention space \u2013 or physical space   like Security Tokens vs.   not having one canon   better communication method   Boris  example  Kauri  tying things more to an EIP process \u2013 measurable outcomes agreement or not implement in hackathons  Jordy  one of problem with EIPs person who writes it is interested parties good position to start \u2013 maybe there is another group \u2013 that has a different perspective competition rather than collaboration EIPs shouldn\u2019t be linked by interest \u2013 more professional manner leadership of an EIP \u2013 not knowing a lot \u2013 just to be sure you are hearing all the parties what are the conflicts, what are shared, neutral arbitration if the EIP, the owner has that much power  TJ Rush  how do we have forcing functions \u2013 that force to not have leaders keep them fluid  Aidan:  no processes \u2013 blow it up to regional areas  Amy  been experimenting responsibility of coming into a circle, need to do work observer, or taking action teach them to someone else they should be able to get there and ready to run choose how to be governed hierarchy - holocracy - consensys close the gap of alignment how inclusive trying to be?  Boris  explanation rings Operations Ring there is no \u201cvolunteers\u201d ring yet \u2013 so maybe we need one (we technically have a group & private forum for volunteering)  Jamie  starts with personal responsibility people feel responsible create a tension \u2013 in order can\u2019t decentralize everything have to have structure can build trust for example with Operations Ring \u2013 there is a multisig resources need to be managed \u2013 need people to help with management how do you deal with resources as part of centralization?  ??  management if there is a lot of money what if proposals are made to receive funding?  William  large issue around funds maybe EthMagicians never want to hold funds money is a horrible thing money needs a bit of organization \u2013 maybe more pure opinion if are no salaries  Boris  explain there isn\u2019t a lot of money opinion: can we only use the donation funds for events  William  making an event how do we give out money  Boris  IETF uses host organizations  Jamie  Internet Society is the partner to IETF Can we move the money to a separate entity any resources is power not just money \u2013 numbering scheme on EIPs  Aidan  how do we take whatever we have here \u2013 bring it back to where we\u2019re from how do we support more people like yourself this conversation is most important for next council livestreaming is great  James  making it so that Magicians don\u2019t have to worry about money separate body? we can do our thing not mixing them sounds like a good thing, sounds like a compromise  Peter Pan  syndicate model \u2013 pledge money to a cause, angel fund propose things, which people should fund or not individual organizations decide how much to fund  Bryant  interesting use of money to servic infrastructure vote with their money, donating to smaller groups that form end of the day there is a need for infra \u2013 including infra to handle money same thing with resource \u2013 take some money to run, common infra we rely on money is best used for that sort of thing, for any group everyone has to fundraise themselves  Boris  costs of volunteers $20K  MP  what if one group wants to fundraise for getting something built \u2013 eg. signal can we still trust people to use the name EthMagicians and raise funds  Bryant  scapegoat co that is formed to do invoices  Brooke  if scapegoat takes invoices, then will be taxed should we non profit? non profits are complexed  Bryant \u201cscapegoat international\u201d MP  can we use Giveth non binding votes fundraising is very difficult  Brooke  getting ahead of ourselves non financial means of supporting sub groups  James  stuff with fundraising that could be under entity grant process or whatever signaling ring \u2013 never once thought I\u2019m representing EthMagicians never said \u201cwe\u2019re from EthMagicians\u201d \u2013 asked for our project to exist  Jamie  these are resources, affiliation not all of us have jobs at organizations that can fund things people that want to participate that flights and things are a big burden trying to enable process like signaling notion  Amy  focused on operational budget rather than future funding have that budget align partnerships \u2013 we do have agreement from these partners  Boris:  ask for consensus on NOT fundraising outside operational costs  MP:  way to express opinions on funded projects \u2013 because we are scaling quite fast  Williams:  anyone should be able to do an EthMagicians event? empower all people  Peter:  doesn\u2019t like voting  Simona:  voting not inclusive  Jamie:  other rings signal  Brooke:  everyone and no one is a magician no one can and can\u2019t but \u2026 we do need to recognize that people will want to borrow the legitimacy of the name  Aidan  from an open source software perspective want to have remote / distributed hackathon Colony has a repo on how to have a remote hackathon Colony never said no one has to have permission we have all the best practices out there make things as forkable as possible  Peter  adding to coordination and borrowing legitimacy the signal of Magicians is provided by individuals  Brooke  inside the dis-organization from outside - EthMagicians is being pointed from the outside potential for abuse  MP  I think that voting and signaling are different things don\u2019t want to hard vote there should be signaling to prevent these things forming an organization \u2013 one of my guys wants to do something political how do we define our goals? what is and is not political? if rough consenus is achieved  Jordy  if we are an organization or not if we are, then there are limitations we need governance \u2013 don\u2019t care about democracy or dictatorship if we act as an organization, need to take those steps  MP  the first form of Ethereum activism we want to jump on this as activism  Bryant  culture \u2013 something between organization and anarchy if you don\u2019t ascribe to the model signal that people should revisit not just a pool of water on the floor  Jamie  as individuals it is loose are we an organization? there is a lot of fictional thinking, decentralized vs formal a human organization is formed \u2013 we know how to organize \u201can institution\u201d --> those geese are coming to consensus loose organization some people want a more legalistic approach  William  one is allocation around resources beneficial to look at EthMagicians that has some organized parts to it there is something organizational / institutional stick with that giant anarchy centralization around resources \u2013 rules around the resources eg website has rules  Aidan  allow culture to define entries and exits if we formalize too much  Brooke  shill event? EthMagicians Shill fest \u2013 then we need to solve it  Aidan  will signal that it is a shill event  Bryant  template?  MP  do we need a way to kill an exit scam  William  Don\u2019t need to de-endorse things Shillcoin Council of New York meritocracy \u2013 anyone can use it \u2013 people would need to educate  Jordy  we are an organization don\u2019t be afraid of organizing when I hear the word signaling \u2013 I want voting! when we are talking about decentralized then power \u2013 rather than signaling, want voting  Jamie  resources like the twitter account in general, a lot more loose sharper edges along other resources individuals have a way to speak out let\u2019s not prematurely optimize  To Do ETHMagicians in the Public Domain Is the term EthMagicians in the Public Domain? What does that mean? TO RESEARCH Permission for Events No one needs permission to run an EthMagicians event Asked for consensus: not met in the room \u2013 some people said, as long as forked from a template, some people said, no rules or constraints, tackle bad actors when / if they arise. Support Smaller / Regional Events Boris: how do we enable / encourage / support smaller regional events around the world? (aka \u201cthere is no way I am doing the madness that is 250 people next to DevCon/insert large ETH event ever again\u201d) TJ + Lane \u2013 small regional Alex / Kauri have people in NYC This small regional event may be part of developing a template. So action item here is great a template / encourage people to run some events / iterate over template. Governance of donated funds  link to forum thread plus operational issues about moving to a better multi-sig  TO DO: who can help investigate / make a plan for this? e.g. move to Giveth? Aragon? more multi-sig holders Jamie & Boris both feel they don\u2019t have expertise / need help. How are Councils run?  Should we follow the template from 2018 for 2019?  Ecosystem Lack of Duplication  Andreas: collaboration across the Ethereum ecosystem, how do we do it better and duplicate efforts less frequently?  Formalizing EIP around Ring Charters James: Would formalizing an EIP around Ring Charters (i.e Rings exist outside of Ethereum Magicans) be helpful to clarifying Rings and their organization. TO EIP DISCUSSION Issuing Invoices Bryant: can we have a shared entity? Who invoices as a shared resource? OPEN Budget TO DO: share this, who can help? Fundraising using Magicians / Use of Funds Boris: Propose that we do NOT use fundraising for anything other than operational needs for Council events In the room: William objected, but not \u201cover my dead body\u201d Jordy: don\u2019t have Quorum! Boris: yes! we gather consensus in the room, and then bring to forum ",

Even I was not able to take part in Meta-Magicians and EIP & Interoperability Discussions, I have listened to it some minutes. As far I could understand, the is an opinion, we need some kind of organization in order to accept donations given to Ethereum Magicians.  I am a big supporter of an idea of personal membership and would avoid any formal organization so much as possible. Money and payments will make the organization even more problematic in my eyes.  So I would make a propos\u2026     Pulling out some of the notes from above, there might be a separate organization purely to hold funds, or continue to have Host Organizations in different countries, or \u2026 something else. In the closing circle, @GriffGreen offered the Giveth platform. I have an open issue where I investigated Open Collective. The EF holding funds be something that works, but might also cause difficulties in holding that organization accountable  ",

                    "content": "@boris @jpitts Regarding the management of donated funds, I\u2019ve noticed (from this and past threads) that this seems to be an evergreen issue. I\u2019ve personally learned from past affiliations with various organizations that while actions can be carried out in an ad-hoc swarm-like manner, funding allocations don\u2019t quite lend themselves to the same ad-hoc treatment (the latter is zero-sum, while the former is not). In addition to Aragon and Giveth, I would suggest taking at look at Colony (the project I am affiliated with). Pitched as \u201ca platform for open organizations\u201d, it is at its core a decentralized budgeting and payments platform. You may find it meets the magicians needs: it is permissive by default, with budgeting priorities determined via reputation-weighted endorsements (requests with higher reputational backing are satisfied first). The reputation system itself is quite dynamic and designed to mirror the way membership in an organization changes over time, allowing decision-making power to be distributed naturally amongst a large group. Inasmuch as \u201cgrooves\u201d support sensible behavior for common tasks, I would say that Colony is quite \u201cgroovy\u201d (in a technical sense, of course).    Colony    Organizations, for the Internet. Colony makes it easy for people all over the world to build organizations together, online.      If this is of interest, I\u2019d be happy to talk more about how Colony could be deployed to support the magicians. We have been in development for quite a while now and are looking at a mainnet launch by the end of the year. We are a fun group.  ",
