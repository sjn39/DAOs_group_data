GitHub    makerdao/dss-chain-log Simple way to track the mcd changelog on-chain. Contribute to makerdao/dss-chain-log development by creating an account on GitHub.      The dss-chain-log is a managed on-chain chainlog for the MCD system. This contract exists at address 0xdA0Ab1e0017DEbCd72Be8599041a2aa3bA7e740F on Mainnet, Kovan, Goerli, Rinkeby, and Ropsten networks and provides to developers an on-chain source of discovery for MCD contract addresses. The viewable functions of this contract can be consumed publicly in smart contracts and UI\u2019s by using a bytes32 key that returns an address value. This contract uses the same keys that are found on the changelog.makerdao.com site, for example, to access the Vat contract, a developer can call key \"MCD_VAT\": $ seth call 0xdA0Ab1e0017DEbCd72Be8599041a2aa3bA7e740F \"getAddress(bytes32)(address)\" $(seth --to-bytes32 $(seth --from-ascii \"MCD_VAT\"))  > 0x35D1b3F3D7966A1DFe207aa4514C12a259A0492B  To get a list of all available keys, use the list() function. $ seth call 0xdA0Ab1e0017DEbCd72Be8599041a2aa3bA7e740F \"list()(bytes32[])\"  > 0x4348414e47454c4f470000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0x4241540000000000000000000000000000.....   Since the chainlog exists at the same address on mainnet and the testnet, developers can now point contracts and user interfaces at the uniform changelog address and retrieve the on-chain address of the MCD core contract on that network. For additional details and functionality, see the github repository. ",
