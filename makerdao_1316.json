                    "content": "If Makershire passes, 10,000,000 DAI belonging to MKR holders and entrusted to MakerDAO governance will be transferred to a 5-of-7 multisig. I have some questions that were not answered by MIP47, which outlines how MakerDAO multisigs will work. If any of the below questions cannot be satisfactorily answered, then the DAO will be putting MKR holders at significant and possibly reckless levels of risk by transferring community funds to a multisig.   What are the specific rules, processes and security that will be utilized during the multisig ceremony? Will the ceremony be in-person or virtual? If virtual, how will the rules, processes & security be enforced?   How can the DAO be assured that the private keys and/or mnemonics securing each of the 7 signing keys were generated in a proper clandestine fashion, have been infallibly secured throughout their existence, and were not compromised before being designated as a multisig signer?   How will the community multisig signers prove to MakerDAO that the multisig keys are not being held in a hot wallet like Metamask (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)?   What ongoing measures will MakerDAO be able to take to ensure that any future compromise of a multisig signers wallet becomes known to the DAO the moment that it happens?   Who will be legally & financially responsible if 5 of the 7 mutlsig keys are compromised and the funds are stolen (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)?   If MakerDAO governance decides to cancel Makershire and revoke the funds, what assurances does the DAO have that the multisig signers will act in the DAOs best interests and return the funds?   What measures are being taken to counteract the financial incentive that 5 of the 7 community multisig signers have to collude to steal, or fake a theft, from the multisig (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)?   In the spirit of decentralization, trustlessness and security for MKR holders, if these questions cannot be satisfactorily answered now, then we need to explore ways to delay the transfer of funds to the Makershire multisig until we can answer them, even if the poll & resulting executive passes. Even if Makershire doesn\u2019t pass, we should still require answers to these questions before transferring MKR funds to community multisigs in the future. ",

Cuz most of the CUs and other initiatives here includes multi-sigs, so would love your explaination about it. Thanks! ",

Multisigs are very useful tools when you created the multisig, you distributed the keys and you\u2019re securing your own money. If you do this properly, either you don\u2019t have to trust anyone or you choose the level of risk that is right for you. But when you are trusting your money to a multisig that was created and is secured by someone else, you run into major security problems. The above questions are a clear demonstration of this. If you are trusting your money to a multisig and cannot answer the above questions, then how can you bring yourself to rationally believe that the multisig is infinitely secure and its creators will act in the correct way?  You simply can\u2019t. Tldr: Multisigs are great if you create them to secure your own money. But they are existentially & incurably wrong when you are trusting your money to a multisig that someone else created and is responsible for securing. ",
