Others, such as How to Attack and Defend Quadratic Funding There is also a pattern of using data science, led by BlockScience, as shown in , but I propose a new layer. We have published a draft of a white paper on a protocol called DeCartography that outputs data from the Plurality social graph as an oracle.

Simply put, we ask people to answer \u201cIs this wallet address similar?\u201d by comparing two transactions  or . To draw this into a two-dimensional map like a social graph, when n people vote on each simple question, each opinion is tied to an n-dimensional value. By clustering them, the Assumpution can be dropped into a single social graph. Generate the coordinates of the consensus on the Assumption. Assumption\" here refers to the decision \"Is this wallet similar (similar community)? In this case, there are only two options, Yes or No, but I think this alone will prevent some degree of collusion.  image1000\u00d7648 217 KB  The image is an earlier prototype, with the tags as choices. This is how the two addresses are lined up, with the question, \u201cAre these two similar?\u201d would be a good question to ask. If more than 51% of the respondents give the same answer, we will simply use that answer as the decision. Actual adjustments would need to be made. For Civil Attack, we of course recommend using Gitcoin Passport. This is because, as you may know if you are familiar with consensus systems as well as PoS, I believe it will settle at Schelling Point. In this case, I expect that the Assumpution will settle on \u201croughly like this\u201d and when they are separated, we can create coordinates with some accuracy  Nash Equilibria and Schelling Points SchellingCoin: A Minimal-Trust Universal Data Feed | Ethereum Foundation Blog  As for aggregation, I wonder if Pol.is could adopt a method to help find consensus.

Then we could incorporate the concept of Social Distance. This may be a promise of Quadratic Land, but I think many people may not understand this Plurality Quadratic Funding at first, so it would be good to have an educational site like this.  Concepts like this Relation Oracle, and Weight Oracle could become the new Plurality identity. Thanks to DisruptionJoe, _sgtn for their reviews. ",

I think we can provide data to Gitcoin\u2019s FDD team.   This is really great work. It is only the second serious attempt at deriving a k value which I have seen next to @erich work on the subject. I really hope this project can receive great funding as a grant and perhaps from the DAO (via FDD) directly. The more I look at it, the more I realize that as open source software it will definitely be a public good. I don\u2019t know what immediate business model might fund it, so it is likely up to us. I would love to know if the software can be used only with inputs from publicly available data such as onchain donations made in Gitcoin rounds and/or passport stamps? ",

I think this so-called way of working is like a PoC with Gitcoin, and I think that DeCartography could proceed in basically the same case.  GIA - Grants Investigations Agency - Gitcoin Testing Ethelo Gitcoin Gov Forum Post - Google Docs  At first, we are thinking of providing our oracle in a way that only FDD can use it because it can be like the GraphQL API (even centralized). What kind of data structures can be added to the k-value (which we call the \u201cQF function\u201d)? For example, the \u201cHumanity\u201d of a Gitcoin Passport should have a QF whose voting power increases or decreases depending on the linked accounts. We hypothesize that given a user A and the project they are donating to, the oracle interface could easily adjust voting power by returning \u201chow far away from the existing donors this user is in the cluster (deviation)\u201d. What might we do First, use the API to get the list of voters from the previous Gitcoin Grants Add them to the PoC target address group and plot them to the most intermediate point once they have been rated by (say) 10 or more different people) This allows one account to be answered \u201cis this address similar or not\u201d from at least 10 different interpretations with a Yes, No, or None and plotted on a 2-dimensional graph ",
