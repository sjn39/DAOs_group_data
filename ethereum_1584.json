You can find a first version here : EIPs/eip-xxxx.md at master \u00b7 npasquie/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub  Simple Summary Standard to request & access offchain computed data while preserving composability  Abstract A standard API is proposed to request & access offchain-computed data in smart-contracts in a composable way. It includes a smart-contract on chain and specifications for clients.  Motivation Off-chain computation checked on-chain has become a common pattern in Dapps, virtually enabling usage of large data sets or complex computations in smart contracts within their limited resources. This is usually achieved through a script in a front-end app generating the correct parameters required by a contract call for a transaction signature. This pattern is by nature non-composable, any protocol that needs to be integrated by other protocols must resolve to implement those costly operations on chain. The proposed new standards would greatly broaden the possibilities of smart-contract developers, especially in the interactions accross protocols. L2-scaling alone can\u2019t provide this kind of application-specific optimisations. Any reflexion/feedback is greatly appreciated  ",
