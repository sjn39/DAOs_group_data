                    "content": "Establishing sources of DAI liquidity has been one of the many primary resource of DAI growth. This has been an effort and function of thousands of integrations made by the BD Core Unit team, Institutional participation/usage, DAI\u2019s popularity via DeFi protocols, and other internal/external factors. Most of us can agree that we will probably see exponential growth in the next 24-months. As they say, liquidity begets liquidity. Recently, I reached out to one of the Founders of Solana, Anatoly Yakovenko\u2013and ask if they were keen on bringing DAI exposure to the Solana ecosystem. They would love to but their plate is full, and he knows it is an initiative that has to be led by the Maker Community/Governance. I have also researched into NEAR\u2019s Rainbow Bridge which was announced on this Forum approximately 13-days ago. Both Layer 1s seem promising, as the ecosystem around them is starting to get some traction. Solana has built Wormhole a Solana/Ethereum Bridge that is currently live that can be used\u2013but I do not know if it\u2019s 100% safe. Hence, I reckon we as a community will need to do more to help push DAI across these bridges. Same goes for the NEAR Rainbow Bridge\u2013not sure if it\u2019s 100% safe. IMO, the community can start by exploring Solana since the protocol is starting to get traction and they have a lot of leverage that is being provided by large players, including FTX\u2013which has DAI listed, but only available in a couple of trading pairs. But unfortunately that DAI cannot be taken off from FTX and use on a Solana Decentralized platform like Raydium or Serum This does not help with DAI exposure. And if you\u2019re wondering if these platforms have Users\u2013believe me they do\u2013check their TGs, or just think Alameda/FTX. Requirements: Organized a Community Dev Team @alexis @smaugho @rain @equivrel (and others I can\u2019t think of right now) and explore Wormhole Create a Gitcoin Grant to get funding (I have a feeling Solana will pour money into it ) Explore and Experiment the possibility of creating a Governance Approved initiative to Create DAI Vaults with a Small Capped DEBT CEILING and have the B.Protocol Team @yaronvel be a Keeper Backstop on Solana (I imagine this being a B.Protocol platform similar to what they have already done with both Maker and Compound\u2013except that Users can open Vaults for low low fees using SOL, or NEAR, and having the parameters set & govern by Maker token holders) If B.Protocol cannot participate\u2013invite current Keepers/Backstop protocols. Pros: No need to create a bridge\u2013it\u2019s already built. More DAI exposure via more DeFi protocols Ability to have partnerships with Solana/FTX led projects Exposure to the NEAR ecosystem If this goes well, why not Acala (polkadot), Avalanche, etc. Cons The idea of deploying Vaults in other Layer 1s has been seen a difficult task by many in the community Most of us  Ethereum too much that one can say that, Love is blind\u2026 Managing DAI via Maker Governance on Ethereum is difficult enough    Does the Community want DAI to have Exposure on the Solana & NEAR Ecosystem?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters         Should we create a Gitcoin Grant and use the Funds raised to have Community Devs build and explore Wormhole as a gateway for DAI into the Solana Ecosystem?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you believe that DAI/ETH Vaults can also exist on Solana layer 1 with a manageable Debt Ceiling and be Govern by MKR Token Holders?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Since NEAR has taken the initiative more that any other Layer 1\u2013we should prioritize NEAR and ask MakerDAO for a Community Dev Grant to build a DAI-ETH  Vault.  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        I\u2019m a Developer and I will help Built this initiative  Yes, count me in! No, I don\u2019t support this idea. I am currently not available.

EDIT: I just realized that @flipflopflapdelegate was suggesting we pay to explore the safety of these bridges. For this, I\u2019d advocate a \u201cdemand approach,\u201d similar to the way the xDai chain has progressed, where security work is done as demand for the bridge is proven/expands. I think we\u2019ll find ourselves too stretched on resources if we try to predict the success of these kind of integrations. If they\u2019re useful integrations (i.e. not \u201cbridges to nowhere\u201d) there will be risk-taking early adopters that do their own due diligence and use the bridge. The signal provided by these early adopters can be used to determine whether further security analysis is warranted. ",

The issue with signal requests is that the results tend to get lost easily if there isn\u2019t an instant or near-instant resolution to the proposal. They are very good for parameter changes and simple sentiment questions (like EIP1559.) But they are quite bad for agreeing on complex future actions. There is a bit of a mix here:  First poll could work as a signal request or informal poll. Second poll would work better as a Declaration of Intent. Third could work as a signal request or informal poll. Fourth is probably another Declaration of Intent (or the same one.) Fifth isn\u2019t really a poll at all, it\u2019s a request for help on the implementation side.  It\u2019s more or less up to you how to proceed, and I\u2019m happy to help you work through whatever process you decide makes sense. However, as it stands I\u2019m not sure how I can condense all these into simple and understandable on-chain polls, so I\u2019ve reworked this as an informal poll, rather than a signal request. ",

I\u2019m pretty sure Solana folks would fund this is the feeling I got from Anatoly. No monetary compensation needed from MakerDAO. Although it would be nice to have funding  from all avenues. Functional bridges but no \u201cpush\u201d for folks to mint \u201cSPL\u201d DAI that can be used in their ecosystem. I suspect the same is happening with NEAR\u2014unless you know about some use cases for DAI on NEAR? EDIT: BTW as I mentioned on RC \u2014 USDC is a front runner to be a medium of exchange within the $150M deal that the city of Miami voted for on Friday. If we can align DAI within the same ecosystem\u2014 we might have a chance to have DAI also be featured at FTX Arena\u2014might be worth spreading our wings\u2026 ",

Two that I know have been relatively vocal about using Dai are Flux and ARterra (although they too are not on mainnet yet, and that\u2019s subject to change). The individuals applying for the Growth Core Unit are in touch with most if not all of the teams that are building on NEAR and considering using Dai. From my perspective it would be easier to signal to that Core Unit that the community would like to see bridge dapps prioritized and they could immediately allocate resources to a strategic collaboration. This would apply to much higher level deals like dealing with FTX /Alameda (who we\u2019ve collaborated with in the past) to ensure Dai has a presence in their sports complex.

In this scenario the only two considerations are:   What drives demand for DAI? Or alternatively, what are barriers that could be removed to facilitate more adoption?   The appropriate role Maker to incentivise the creation of these Liquidity Pools by liaising directly with Solana, Near and the specific projects of interest.   The harsh reality and honest answer to the first question is that it is absurdly expensive to engage with any expensive with the DAI ecosystem due to Eth gas fees. This situation excludes the vast majority of users that are not whales and locks us out of the increasingly larger waves of new users which will join the blockchain movement over the next 24 months. DAI becoming available on Solana and NEAR through the bridges only solve the high cost of transacting in DAI. However, it doesn\u2019t address the cost of managing vaults and the subsequent issue of there not being enough DAI for a functional growing market (think Venezuelans or Argentinians using DAI for daily expenses). So to me the real area of opportunity is to issue DAI vaults on other Layer 1s. I am not that familiar with Solana, but I know that NEAR is deploying an EVM which should allow for the existing Maker infrastructure to be deployed on NEAR with minimal changes and allow for cheap issuance of DAI, etc. I have heard of several projects receiving financial and technical support from NEAR to help them expand on their EVM, so the only barrier that I see t making this a reality and roaring success is some people people\u2019s Ethereum Maximalism. To recap;  the bridges exist and are functional, DAI will migrate naturally; focus could be placed on incentivising the creation of Liquidity Pools on Solana and NEAR protocols the core area of opportunity is to explore expanding the Maker vaults to Near\u2019s EVM explore collaboration and funding from Near to expand across  ",
