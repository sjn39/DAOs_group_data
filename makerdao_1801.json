Though a significant increase in both community sizes and funds within the ecosystem indicates a maturing environment, the glitter of success also attracts nefarious individuals and groups seeking to damage the ecosystem in exchange for their own personal gains. While some aspects of cybersecurity within the space are well-known, primarily software audits, the shift in the ecosystem indicates a need for more proactive as well as reactive measures. With MakerDAO not only being one of the largest ecosystems in the space but also a pioneer in the push for decentralization, it is a prime target for these nefarious people. We wish to prevent, or, at the very least, minimize the negative effects of their intended actions.  Mission Systematically improve security for builders, end users, and other stakeholders in the Maker Ecosystem by providing both reactive and proactive security services.  Vision A Maker ecosystem with the right security measures, including regular self-evaluation for constant improvement, in order to allow the ecosystem builders and users to focus on innovation and adoption. This is achieved through:   Security Operations   Bug Bounty Program - An industry-leading bug bounty program to adequately incentivize whitehat hackers to look for vulnerabilities in the Maker codebase as well as blackhat hackers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.  Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure - At the pleasure and direction of TechOps and engineering teams, run and maintain monitoring software for critical infrastructure.  Incident Response Facilitation - Fill gaps in internal expertise to minimize damages to the Maker ecosystem in the event of a successful attack.    Community Support   Education and Advisory - Review and update security-related aspects of MakerDAO\u2019s operations. Create security resources available to all Core Units and the wider Maker community, as well as provide on-call security advisory services to foster a culture where security is taken more seriously.     Core Unit ID IS-001  Core Unit Name Immunefi Security  Core Unit Mandate The overall goal of the Immunefi Security CU is to secure the Maker ecosystem through multiple angles by leveraging its existing and growing security community and expertise. This involves dedicated services to the Maker ecosystem, effectively establishing a security partnership with the DAO. The CU will also aim to complement and collaborate with existing and future CUs instead of competing with them, leveraging existing processes, infrastructure, and information, among others, in order to deliver greater value to the Maker ecosystem. As a pioneer in the DeFi space with billions in funds in the protocol, the Maker ecosystem is an attractive target for blackhat hackers who look to steal funds or disrupt the protocol. With millions lost regularly in the cryptocurrency space, it is likely that the Maker protocol, its key people, and its key infrastructure, are targeted on a regular basis. Due to budgetary constraints, much of our CU\u2019s mandate is aspirational. Our minimal service level includes the Bug Bounty Program, Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure, and close scrutiny of security-related issues. Scrutiny includes engagement in forum discussions on security related topics, polls to probe for changes in security policy, and governance fire drills.  Bug Bounty Program The Immunefi Security CU will orient its growing community of security researchers on the Immunefi bug bounty platform towards the Maker ecosystem. Leveraging its expertise with bug bounty programs across the cryptocurrency space, especially the DeFi ecosystem, the Immunefi Security CU will maintain the MIP64 bug bounty program to economically incentivize further investigation of the code. The program will attract whitehat hackers who find vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them, so they are fixed before they can be exploited. Additionally, this provides an incentivized opportunity for disclosure of vulnerabilities instead of exploitation for blackhat hackers. In order to achieve this, the Immunefi Security CU will:  Coordinate with various CUs in order to identify the scope of assets as well as impacts to ensure that bugs reported are those that are valuable to the ecosystem. Maintain the program by incorporating additional content where needed, such as additional requirements for submissions, restrictions, and information, adding and removing scope as needed, and including various improvements from knowledge gained through the operation of the overall Immunefi platform. If necessary, the Immunefi Security CU will create separate bug bounty programs for different areas, for example smart contracts vs. cloud infrastructure. Triage all vulnerability reports and escalate to the appropriate CU as needed. Publicly report all critical vulnerabilities after all fixes have been implemented and verified in the format of a postmortem, and respond to inquiries from the community.   Incident Response Facilitation Even with an effective Bug Bounty Program and appropriate incentives in place, there are always those who don\u2019t care about these incentives, or believe that they can get away cleanly with more funds than the bug bounty program reward. This is why the Maker ecosystem should still be prepared to react appropriately in the event of a serious successful attack. The Immunefi Security CU will collaborate to fill gaps in internal expertise to minimize the impact of attacks.  PR specialists to take a proactive role in framing the perception of the exploit in a constructive manner, with the appropriate legal review of public statements. Community coordinators to assist existing community organizers and managers in dealing with the immediate aftermath of the exploit.   Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure In April 2022, L\u00e1zaro Ra\u00fal of Nethermind, funded by Forta, put together a suite of monitoring agents for MakerDAO to promote their new Forta platform. TechOps and engineering teams consented to allow Immunefi Security CU to run and maintain these monitoring tools. We welcomed this responsibility and anticipate adding to our monitoring capabilities in the future.  Education and Advisory As a last pillar of our strategy, the Immunefi Security CU will provide educational resources and on-call advisory, especially those for areas not covered by the Full Spectrum Security Service.  Review and update the security related content of official MakerDAO manuals and documentation. Engage in forum discussions on security related topics. Run polls to probe for changes in security policy. Provide content that is accessible to the wider community, including resources for end users, with prioritization determined after getting feedback from other CUs Conduct live seminars and workshops for Maker ecosystem projects and CUs, with a focus on smart contract security, including bringing in experts from the wider ecosystem to provide up-to-date security information. Be accessible to all Maker projects and CUs for advisory on security-related matters in the form of an open questions and answers channel as well as an office hours call at least twice a month. Collaborate with CUs that need to provision security processes, such as the SES CU when new CUs are being onboarded.   Related Documents  DAI Budget  ",

Paragraph Summary The Immunefi Security Core Unit (ISCU) requests a 786,830 DAI budget to sustain minimal operations for another year starting 01 Dec 2022 (option Status Quo). Due to market conditions, we propose an alternative (option Bear Market) with a reduction of 0.2 FTEs, which will slow response time and increase the likelihood of using the MIP64c5 process. Option Bear Market requests a 12-month budget of 427,790 DAI (approx 359k DAI less).  Specification  Motivation The budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the minimal level of service described in our Mandate (MIP39c2-SP24). This is summarized by, but not limited to:  Bug Bounty Program, including initial triaging. Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure. Close scrutiny of security-related issues. Engagement in forum discussions on security related topics. Polls to probe for changes in security policy. Governance fire drills.   Core Unit ID IS-001  Common Budget Implementation The budget is designed with the following in mind:  Operational costs to run the Core Unit and perform its tasks. Operational costs of third parties contracted. Legal expenses. Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems.  Therefore, a vote to ratify this subproposal means MKR holders make a commitment to a continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism.  Budget diagram1541\u00d7406 33.7 KB  IS-001 currently has three DAI vesting streams in operation: stream IDs: 19, 32, and 34. Stream 19 and stream 34 have reached their end-date, while stream 32 completes on 2022-12-01. Upon passage of this budget proposal, before a new stream is set up by GovAlpha and PE through an executive vote, stream 19 and stream 34 will have vest called and all vested DAI will be immediately returned via DssBlow. The new stream being setup will be for the approved budget amount, minus any remaining DAI in stream 32.

Software Expenses will be used to provide for internal organizational tools and secure communications channels. Hardware Expenses will be used to provide for team hardware (e.g., a secure laptop). In part due to low gas prices, our operational wallet has 0.33 ETH. We last purchased gas during April 2022. Software Development Expense reflects the amount budgets for rapid payment for small bug bounties. Actual payouts are unpredictable. For the prior year, we have paid out 127,500 to whitehats and 5,500 in bounty fees to Immunefi. In view of our modest payouts, we propose a lower budget for the coming year.  Budget Term Dec 2022 to Dec 2023  Increasing Value to Maker Tokenholders ISCU seeks to prevent losses to the protocol. We have paid bug bounties for five website bugs: 5570, 5700, 9845, 8826, 9372. No valid bugs were reported in smart contracts. During the year, 113 bugs were closed as invaild (bugs in ID range 5565-11680).  Roadmap and Objectives We will conduct governance fire drills approximately four times per year. However, the frequency and type of fire drill may be modified depending on guidance from Governance Facilitators. Our work running the bug bounty program and scrutiny of security-related issues is impossible to plan in advance. We promise to serve Maker with diligence, but cannot provide a roadmap. During the next year, we expect onboarding of Sidestream Auction Services, Oracles, Deco, and StarkNet Engineering.  Headcount Planning / Team Summary Although Travin ceased receiving compensation from July 2022, he remains a multisig signer and consults with Joshua in regard to bug reports. Travin has largely moved on to areas of his businesses outside the Immunefi bug bounty platform, but he is still in charge of activities of the Core Unit and contributes to decisions on the services that it offers to the ecosystem. Joshua handles all day-to-day tasks associated with the Core Unit. His compensation is for 0.8 FTE.  Contingency Planning In a bear market context, Joshua could reduce his time to 0.6 FTE. This reduction in compensation would correspond with a reduction in response time and somewhat less scrutiny of ongoing security issues. In a bull market context, Travin would be called upon to hire another staffer to fulfill the Core Unit\u2019s mandate more fully. We would submit a MIP40 budget amendment to allocate additional budget and confirm this plan with MKR holders.  Unwinding and Defunding A Golden Parachute payout will be provided to the Core Unit for the Facilitator to distribute to their team. The amount will be three months worth of Compensation & Benefits \u2014 8,800 DAI x 3 months = 26,400. Any MKR accrued (vested or not) at the time of offboarding ratification will be eligible for payout. If the MKR Incentive Plan has a cliff, it will be ignored and allow the MKR amount to be transferred to the Core Unit. Excess funds will be returned to the auditors wallet. Monitoring agents will be handed off to TechOps or other engineering staff.  Proposal Parameters   Minimum Feedback Period: 1 Month.  Minimum Frozen Period: 1 Week. Ratification Polls for MIP40c3 subproposals involving a Core Unit Budget Modification will have different requirements to MIP51c2. Instead of binary voting, they must use multiple options as follows:  A: Approve status quo budget (786 830) B: Approve bear market budget (427 790) C: Reject budget D: Abstain    In order for this Ratification Poll to conclude successfully and the contained proposal(s) move to Accepted status, each of the following conditions must be true:   A or B vote-weight must exceed C vote-weight when the poll closes. Winning vote-weight must exceed the Minimum Positive Participation value of 10,000 MKR when the poll closes.

The proposed budget will run from 2022-12-01 until 2023-12-01. This is a valid MIP40c3 subproposal and it is eligible to enter the November Governance Cycle as per MIP51. The following two options will be submitted on-chain along with the Reject Budget and Abstain options:  Status Quo Budget: 786,830 DAI streamed over 12 months. Bear Market Budget: 427,790 DAI streamed over 12 months.

                    "content": "This question suggests to me that you haven\u2019t fully understood how a bug bounty program works. We are actually on the hook for practically unlimited payouts. If you scroll down to the payout amounts in our contractual agreement, you\u2019ll find that a High severity smart contract vuln is worth up to 100k DAI and a Critical severity smart contract vuln is worth up to 10M DAI. Suppose we received valid reports for 3 High severity bugs and 2 Critical severity bugs. This could prompt a total payout of 2,300,000 DAI. Strikingly, there is no maximum payout; there is no upper bound. The limiting factor is that PECU & friends are really, really excellent at writing correct code. The reason we have a bug bounty program is because the damage to the protocol from actual bugs could be even worse than the damage to the protocol from having a bug bounty program. For example, \u201cAny governance voting result manipulation\u201d would be regarded as Critical severity because governance has total control over the whole system and potentially could steal all the collateral. Better to reward a bounty hunter with 10M DAI than allow the protocol to suffer a severe, potentially fatal attack. In short, the goal of the bug bounty program is to prevent MakerDAO from appearing on the rekt leaderboard. ",

Are the Recognized Delegates not in consensus with what should happen?   You need to ask the StableNode platform as delegates are independent thinkers. One last thing I want to state publicly You reached out to me privately about your desire to apply as the facilitator for Immunefi CU. I told you that I believed that your CU is best set up as an Ecosystem Actor.
