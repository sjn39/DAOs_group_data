Would it be an idea if we attempted to always include the options \u201cabstain\u201d and \u201cdisagree with poll options\u201d in any poll on the forum? \u201cAbstain\u201d gives one the possibility of signaling \u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m not knowledgeable on the matter\u201d etc. This I believe is a valuable input. It would help us identify areas where more knowledgeable people are needed (E.g. to avoid centralization of knowledge or complete lag of knowledge in some areas). \u201cDisagree with poll options\u201d is a way of abstaining however for a very specific reason which one should then describe below the poll. This input would also be really valuable imo and would hopefully give the poll creator some input on if and how a poll would possibly  make more sense. Hope the above makes sense. ",

As it occurred to me that Rich (and any other impartial actor) probably wants to see the results without voting. As these options are all essentially an abstention it perhaps makes sense to split it down further. Although I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s good to have a huge amount of options that won\u2019t usually be used. We could have: Abstain (I just want to see results) Abstain (I have no Opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgeable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection) I\u2019ll start doing this and see if anyone complains.
