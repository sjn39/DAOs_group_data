The interoperability topic is a central for architects too, so I would propose to make a joint session at least on this topic, Further Ring specific topics could be discussed separately if needed. @apitkevich, agree?

You\u2019re welcome to bounce between sessions and there is lots to do post event to continue the discussion. And if you could write more about your thoughts on interoperability that would be great.
