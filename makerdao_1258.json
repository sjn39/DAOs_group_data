                    "content": "Just for the sake of governance discussion and being able to direct people to my personal mental model for MakerDAO, here is my platform. I will change my mind from times to times. Doesn\u2019t reflect the view of Strategic Finance. It\u2019s just the meta-platform you need to support if you want MKR to the moon. If you prefer convoluted stuff, you should support the endgame party. My overall mental model can be found on my Crypto Banking Blog North Star: Increasing Equity per MKR Why: MakerDAO is a financial protocol that make profit by the difference of financial revenues (Stability Fees on lending) and what we pay, financial expenses (DSR). Those organizations are valued between 0.5x and 2x the equity (see here). Therefore, from a strategical perspective, increasing this metric increase the price of MKR. That\u2019s the game we are playing. One business: Balance sheet allocation Why: Simplicity is key. We should just find cheap funding (like DAI) and allocate wisely and programmatically. No need to do complex stuff or exotic investments. We should do three things: investing in liquid token (tokenized public markets, probably ETH, \u2026), repo (lending) against those liquid tokens and market making. It is 3 products (PSM-style, vaults, and a LP manager) that work with ERC20. There is some work to be done on liability management as well, but nothing rocket science. It\u2019s market-based finance, faceless finance. No relationship, custom deals or relationships. Sacred MKR rights: Burning 2% of the equity every year Why: Increasing equity is the goal but such provision provide some stability in price. The premium/discount over the equity value is mainly due to market trusting or not the management. We should be able to grow equity by 10-20% per year so 2% is just a bit. Cost control: Workforce expenses capped to 50% of recurring revenues Why: North Star and Sacred MKR rights come first. I\u2019ve never saw a correlation between spending and growth for financials organizations The backstop: Burning only mode when MKR price < 90% equity Why: This is relutive and sound management. Only reason it is not done in TradFi is because almost no management wants to manage a smaller and smaller business. Not that it applies to MakerDAO currently (equity $92 while market price 10x higher).  That\u2019s it, quite short and simple yet opiniated. I will allocate my vesting to delegates that are close to implementing this strategy, if any, going forward. You can signup below. I\u2019m not asking you to bow, just to have a brain and have courage. Warriors of the world, let\u2019s unite. ",

If TradFi already lends on this collateral why shouldn\u2019t Maker? And the interest rates would be much higher than a T-Bill. Also, it can be used as an employee retention program that actually enables off-balance sheet leverage. On an overcollateralized basis. I have already found a third-party lender, The Bancorp, and a fintech KAPED credit that issues secured business credit cards with crypto cash back rewards. Imagine being able to yield farm cash value and MKR with your cash back rewards. Banks already use the cash value as a deposit and rehypothecate it. This would raise the DSR to a sustainable level that can expand. As more DeFi users borrow, more loans are issued to RWAs and as those RWAs grow, so too does the DSR which leads to a positive feedback loop.

But to your point, MakerDAO is a cryptobank, which is a non-regulated financial institution, so being close to a corporation is probably fine. I let you guys reinvent modern capitalism but until you come with a solution, I don\u2019t see how creating a mess align with the north star here defined as increasing equity per MKR. What I suggest completely allows to upgrade to the new system when ready. A founder led startup is also an option, but we are not heading there neither (for legal or ideological reasons doesn\u2019t matter). We are governed by our MIPs and I will defend them as long as they stay. But it\u2019s time to change them. Or we can keep them. Whatever MKR holders want really. Let\u2019s just decide so we can build. ",

Short-term investments being D3M Aave and the current crypto loans.

In the currency vs credit poll, most were in the view of DAI being a currency (or should become one). If you have some doubts about the US$ future (which I have), you might use it as unit of account (tight peg) but with the ability to keep the store of value feature should the US$ fade away (and therefore change the unit of account in the future). Such positioning should help getting traction (not saying easy). And you don\u2019t sacrifice much as nothing would change for years/decades anyway (except you no longer try to get DAI in fungible with other stablecoins at crypto-exchanges, it is no longer a stablecoin but a cryptocurrency). It would help the world migrate seamlessly from US$ to ETH (assuming ETH wins). More technical details are in the end of the second article.  image1050\u00d7722 17.9 KB  Such a path is also compatible with the ALM forecast published earlier this summer. It don\u2019t think much technical work would be needed, it\u2019s more branding, marketing and ecosystem building. ",
