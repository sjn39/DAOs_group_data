Please give it a try to understand support for your proposals. Some tips:  You must delegate for votes to count on a proposal You can set the proposal snapshot block number to around the end date of the proposal (or any future block number) so people can delegate after the proposal is created and voting has started  Currently there is no UNI requirement for a proposal to show up on the snapshot page. This is open source and you are able to send pull requests to the repository. ",
