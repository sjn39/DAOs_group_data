                    "content": "Introduction: For the past year, the Maker Foundation has been researching and experimenting how to generate additional value from the Maker Protocol by providing collateral which does not originate on the blockchain. This post intends to kick-off discussions on including \u201creal world assets\u201d (\u201cRWA\u201d) in the Maker Protocol and highlight questions we believe projects should consider if they are interested in seeing these assets on-boarded. An important thing to remember is that any approach involving RWA \u2013 be they securities, commodities or otherwise \u2013 will touch on regulated products, players and markets. Therefore, a regulatorily compliant framework is the critical feature to successfully expand the collateral types available for Vault users. But given the complexity involved, we want to start the Community off with the incipient points below. What kind of \u201cRWA\u201d are we talking about? In the simplest terms, an RWA is anything that does not originate from a blockchain and uses the recourse of the relevant legal apparatus to maintain consensus over its ownership. A hybrid of a blockchain native and an RWA are fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC. They use the blockchain to track account balances but ultimately rely on the judiciary of the United States, or another jurisdiction of issuance, for recourse. Other more \u201cvanilla\u201d assets include tokenized equities and treasury bonds. This simple definition, however, does not accomplish much for the Maker Protocol. To source assets that contribute to a robust, large and healthy financial ecosystem, the Maker Community should focus on their economics as well. RWA that are most useful to Maker should have large supplies, predictable demand for credit and a cost of capital over LIBOR/Fed Funds. Potential users that hold assets with these characteristics may be able to use the Maker Protocol to establish or replace credit lines and supplant private sources of capital by locking their RWA into Vaults and generating Dai. In the legacy economy, bank credit is the source for nearly all of the money supply. Borrowers interact with originators and these originators sell or pledge their assets to banks. The originators then draw on these credit facilities to originate more loans, with banks creating new money in the process. Originators are essential because they act as middlemen with aligned incentives - they price individual loans and allow the bank to analyze a diversified portfolio when setting their risk parameters. In doing so, the calculus of originators is simple - interest paid in by the loans they extend minus the interest paid to the bank or to private investors equals their net interest margin. It\u2019s important to note that since this calculus is predictable and scalable (in the sense that it reflects the current money creation process), these economic actors\u2019 assets could fit well in the Maker Protocol. Decentralization vs Diversification There have been many comments in the forums and on social media that Maker should be targeting assets by how decentralized they are. This is an inaccurate premise and belies a misunderstanding of what makes a stablecoin resilient in the face of malicious actors. In contrast, the Maker holders should likely focus on developing a maximum level of diversification in the collateral portfolio in order to make Dai as resilient as possible. In this context, diversification refers to the minimization of any single type of risk, which goes well beyond volatility risk and centralization (illicit seizure) risk. To use an example, imagine that Dai was only backed by digitally native assets like ether. This means that no one can illicitly seize the collateral in the protocol \u2013 users have total independent control of their assets (unless one\u2019s Vault is liquidated). But relying solely on ether, or a similar asset, forces the Protocol to depend heavily on trading and liquidity from centralized exchanges, some more reputable than others. But the Maker Protocol depends not only on user\u2019s custodying their assets, but also on those assets\u2019 liquidity and price stability. If 100% of the protocol\u2019s assets are based upon secondary fiat markets on centralized exchanges, a whole new host of risks emerges that can only be mitigated by diversification of marketplaces. In an ideal future, the DAO would minimize any single risk to Dai through diversifying asset types, price sources, liquidity venues and regulatory regimes. None of this is to say that Dai itself will become any less decentralized in the process. It will always be true that no one can seize or freeze Dai. This concept is specific to the collateral portfolio which is abstracted away from Dai holders. Potential Types of Asset Portfolios Available for the Maker Protocol Conceptually there are two ways two think of the structuring process that allows a token to represent a claim on an asset in the Maker Protocol:  Tokenize a claim on a particular underlying asset itself Create and tokenize a debt instrument which represents a claim on proceeds of the underlying asset in the event of a liquidation  Method number one involves properly classifying and/or registering the instrument (e.g., some assets could be securities and require registration with the appropriate authorities) before its inclusion in the Protocol. Price discovery would need to happen on appropriately licensed secondary markets and, in countries such as the United States, be subject to the various transfer restrictions of a security offering. One can envision a future where users may access a regulated UI (a \u201cwalled garden\u201d) operated by an appropriately registered entity and lock their equity tokens in a Vault to generate Dai. This example assumes several developments, such as regulated markets/portals and user\u2019s willingness to register and submit KYC information, but is not beyond the imagination. Method number two is another possible means for on-boarding RWA to the Maker Protocol. In this construct, an asset originator (e.g., a loan originator or receivables holder) would identify, isolate and collect assets (e.g., loan revenues or receivables) they wish to onboard into an entity they controlled called a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). This SPV would serve the limited purpose to custody the specific assets being entered into the Maker Protocol. The originator could then mint an NFT that represents each asset in the SPV (not equity in the SPV or a right to the asset\u2019s cash flows) and contains enough metadata to price the asset independent of context. Though the NFT is not a claim on the asset, it is a way for Oracles and Keepers to price the portfolio in the event of a liquidation. If the asset holder does not wish to mint NFTs, they likely will need to publish this data in a readily accessible format. Finally, the SPV would mint tokens representing a pro rata share to the pool of assets held by the SPV. Those tokens would be placed as collateral into the Vault and subject to the same parameters and rules as all other collateral, including liquidation. The NFTs (or supplied data) would be used by an Oracle to continuously price the collateral tokens and inform the Protocol\u2019s parameters and rules. This process can also be done manually by governance, should digital price feeds not be available. For liquidation, more likely than not, an intermediary like a registered broker-dealer or Futures Commission Merchant would have to administer the token auctions. Auction winning Keepers, or other holders, would then seek redemption on their collateral tokens from the SPV. In a perfect world, the originator would use the SPV and Vault, continuously exchanging assets, to create Dai to fund its operating costs until it no longer had liquidity needs. When complete, the asset holder would return the borrowed Dai funds to the Vault and close it, via the SPV, and then dissolve the SPV. With these steps done, the process would conclude. The above is a high level, simple review of two asset types that could be considered for inclusion in the Maker Protocol, so please do not take this post as gospel. In combination with these initial thoughts, we want to elaborate on questions the token issuers may consider when deciding whether to proffer their assets for inclusion as Maker collateral. The following are not exhaustive, though, and please feel free to add your thoughts and inquiries in the comments:  Q: Does the Protocol provide a benefit to the asset or originator and will the asset provide a benefit to the Protocol? Q: What is the underlying asset to be included in the Protocol and then how will it be included in the Protocol? Q: Are there ready and secure price feeds available for the proposed asset? Q: How will a trusted Oracle or Price Data Feed be established and what will be the requirements of its duties? Q: Does the asset attempt to separate cash flow from the entity looking to borrow (generate Dai from a vault)? If so, how will that be accomplished \u2013 legally, functionally? Q: Does the asset trade on secondary markets? Is it typically sold in private placements? Q: What is the legal classification of the asset? What is the legal structure within which the asset was issued (e.g., securities offering, e-money issuance, factoring, etc.)? What would be the legal classification of a bespoke method for including the asset in the Protocol (e.g., Method 2 above)? Q: Based upon the legal classification of the underlying asset or its representative token, what are the additional requirements for its inclusion in the Protocol (e.g., regulated intermediaries like broker-dealers, specific registration with a regulator of the token, limitations of Keepers, reporting requirements, etc.)? Q: What are the specific risks associated with the asset: technological (e.g., transfer restrictions), legal (e.g., AML/KYC requirements), economic (e.g., availability of real-time performance data) and regulatory (e.g., asset classification as a security or derivative)? Q: Who will bear those risks and how will that be accomplished?  Our next post will cover a potential design for on-boarding a RWA and review the glaring gaps we believe need to be filled. ",

We\u2019re supportive of the Maker community and Foundation efforts here, and we look forward to the community reaction/questions. Perhaps it\u2019s helpful to share how we\u2019re thinking about this in the context of the two examples provided. 1 - tokenizing a claim on a particular underlying asset. Given the applicability of US securities law, there are a few pieces that\u2019d need to move in lockstep here.  @g_dip mentioned KYC/AML, regulated venues for pricing oracles, and a partitioned environment for registered entities and eligible users. In our view, there\u2019s also a question of custody of the token, establishing a satisfactory control location for sovereignty over the custodied token, and compliant liquidation mechanisms in line with existing auction process. 2- tokenized debt instrument representing claim on proceeds. Given the standing of debt in the eyes of US regulators, this SPV cashflow structure appears more favorable.  We view SPV\u2019s of single-tranche credit instruments as one of the lower-hurdle approaches, with few additional parties involved.  The complexity in this model appears would be primarily driven by liquidation mechanisms, and ensuring value is returned to the Maker ecosystem in a compliant manner. Additional thoughts & questions  We like to think about potential collateral asset classes across a spectrum of simple single-tranche credit, structured credit, royalty/rev shares, and equity or fund interest.  These buckets have varying levels of complexity in terms of regulatory requirements, valuation, and risk management.  Choosing the right asset class/instrument can significantly raise or lower barriers. Outside of RWA\u2019s with trading venues, we\u2019d expect there to be a cost associated with pricing the collateral asset on an ongoing basis.  Who bears this cost? How can the protocol mitigate information superiority of those pledging their assets? What is the community\u2019s position with regards to interacting with regulated entities? and could that be improved with a new ecosystem role designation for this profile of user?  @Kukkio , your image reflects a very similar model to what we\u2019re working on.  We believe the \u2018professional third party and liquidator\u2019 you\u2019ve outlined may additionally require a number of third parties across some or all following roles (again, varying by specific underlying asset class and approach): KYC/AML provider, custodian, broker dealer, transfer agent, debt servicing company, valuation expert.  Given the nuance of each potential collateral asset class, it\u2019s difficult to offer any particular detail at this stage of the conversation as to what an ideal model looks like.  However, we look forward to contributing as this discussion continues in the comments and in subsequent posts, and as our own thinking sharpens with community input. ",

And also more generally interested in the problem of how to create a process for getting RWA included as collateral. It\u2019s got to cover the same bases a traditional lender would cover wrt price risk, credit risk, counter party risk, etc. But, with the benefit of being publicly transparent, generalized, and decentralized. I think the trick will be finding a generalized model that can handle the nuances @Blake_Vertalo describes without relying too heavily on centralized expertise that may be hard to verify. Some details on the specific mortgage case: Mortgage origination is a highly regulated and well-litigated industry. It clearly falls into the bucket of RWA that\u2019s easy to tokenize and has to rely on the judicial systems of the given jurisdiction to enforce collateral rights. Given the many centuries mortgage deeds have been around, how well enforced and consistent the rights are in almost every country on earth, and the incredible size of the market, it\u2019s a decent place to start. When a mortgage originator funds a loan, there is a buyer who has already agreed to purchase the loan. But, it takes about a week to get the purchase settled. The price is already set within 24 hours of the loan funding and can\u2019t change afterwards. This is almost identical in practice to invoice factoring (which would also be a really interesting asset to look into getting as DAI collateral). Lending against the mortgages while they\u2019re waiting for settlement is already a very common practice (known to banks as Mortgage Warehouse lending) that banks love because the collateral is a super short term, real-estate backed, and well diversified, so the risk is low and the prices are very stable. Most lines have 99% collateralization rates. In terms of volume, there\u2019s almost $10B per day in mortgages originated in the US right now that could be used. If each loan stays in the pool for the average 10 days, that\u2019s $100B in possible collateral with effectively zero price variability and high collateralization rates. My question is what data are MKR holders interested in seeing exposed about the loans to be able to evaluate the risk in real-time? Our current warehouse lenders know the loans are only high-quality Qualified Mortgages and see top-level credit information and loan details like principal and term. ",

Forex trading is currently centralized and competitive, meaning slippages and spreads are quite low. It would be most interesting to see a breakdown of how a decentralized alternative would stack up against a conventional forex website with regards to cost. There are several ways such a service could work: there could be a plain token vs token exchange, there could be a hedging service, it could be pvp or using defi curves etc etc. It is also of course the question if it is in the interest of Maker to have such a site, it would possibly be better if Maker did not own it. A third alternative is of course to just ask Curve or some other team to just include the TrustTokens in their pools. It is after all not Maker\u2019s task to do marketing for Trust Tokens\u2026 ",
