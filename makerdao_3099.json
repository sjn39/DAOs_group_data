If you want to send back the payouts you\u2019ve received so far, presumably you could just send the DAI back to the address it came from (maker-cred.eth, the address SourceCred sends payouts from), or back to Maker (where we get the DAI from).  Will ask the SourceCred working group how exactly they want to handle that. Have sent you a DM from @sourcecred-trial-adm with the ETH address we\u2019ve been sending payouts to. As for leaving SourceCred, there is no leaving SourceCred bwahahahahaha   ! By which I mean, everyone has a Cred score, which is continually updated with new data, whether or you\u2019re opted in or not. Opting out will just stop payouts based on your score. You\u2019ll still see your updated score in the live instance, and be able to opt in again if you choose. I must ask though, are you sure this is best for MakerDAO? One of the motivations behind including some Foundation members was to incentivize them to post more on the forums, increasing transparency and engagement with the wider governance community. When I look at your Cred score over time (plotted below), it appears you started contributing in earnest not long after the trial started in June. Was this inspired by the trial? If so, isn\u2019t that a good thing? Will you be as incentivized moving forward if not receiving payouts? You seem to write quality post that the community appreciates. I\u2019m tempted to say this is just the system working, and would ask the community, is this result not worth the payouts? image1984\u00d71214 89.7 KB To be honest, I kind of wish everyone was just eligible. It sidesteps a lot of complexity and issues such as these. At the same time, it also mirrors a pattern we\u2019ve seen in other early adopters of SourceCred. Namely that people are sensitive to the relative amount of payouts. Which makes sense. And also raises larger issues around privacy vs transparency that MakerDAO is still grappling with as it decentralizes. ",

I am in no way saying that other exempt Foundation members should follow my lead on this, everyone definitely deserves their payout including those of us who work with the Foundation, just that in this particular situation I\u2019d like to \u201cpay it forward.\u201d However since it seems like sending it back would just give the money back to the Foundation and not to the community, let me think about the best way to do this.
