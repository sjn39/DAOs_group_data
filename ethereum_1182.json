                    "content": "Hello. I haven\u2019t found any article talking about these issues, so I decided to make a post asking about them. First one is ETH not being compliant to ERC20. ERC20 standard provides an interface so that smartcontracts are able to interact with any ERC20-compliant token. As we all know, ETH is prior to ERC20 and isn\u2019t compliant to it, so sc must either have double functions to handle ERC20 and ETH, or rely on swapping for WETH which makes them spend more gas, and WETH isn\u2019t ETH at all. Anybody knows if on ETH 2.0 we\u2019ll have ETH compatible with fungible tokens standard? The other one is needing to authorize smartcontracts to mess with a token on our address so that we can interact with it using that token. I don\u2019t understand how that design could have been created, as it\u2019s a huge security flaw. We must trust sc won\u2019t steal our tokens from our address and will do only what it announces and we accept, which includes it being hacked or \u201cused in innovative ways\u201d. For Trezor T users it\u2019s even worse, as we never see on our device screen what token is being sent neither its amount. Will ETH 2.0 remove this authorization stuff and just let we clearly see on transaction the token amount we\u2019re sending when interacting with the sc? ",
