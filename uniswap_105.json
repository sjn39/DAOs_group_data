Where have you seen anywhere in the world a voting system where a single person can cast 10 million votes?? And vote on the proposal he made himself where he is asking for 20 million USD?? And worst of all, thanks to his 10 million votes, he gets the 1.000.000 UNI and immediately sells half of it\u2026 And yea, tries to sweet talk out of it, because, that\u2019s what lawyers do, right?? Not only that, there\u2019s also good and honest proposals that NEVER get to Consensus Check because a SINGLE WHALE doesn\u2019t like it and votes \u201cNO\u201d with millions of votes\u2026 Even though there\u2019s hundreds of people that are in favor of the proposal\u2026 That\u2019s just WRONG! Didn\u2019t even do a temperature check for this proposal, because, who would really give up that kind of voting power, right? So this is a proposal to NOT ALLOW ANY DELEGATES to vote on ANY Proposal, and to CHANGE the voting system as following:  If a person wants to vote on any proposal, they should have at least 1 UNI on their wallet. Regardless of the number of UNI they on their wallet, they can only cast 1 VOTE.  This will allow us to have a more FAIR and DEMOCRATIC system. It will also help avoid bots with the 1 UNI requirement. And if a person has 10 million UNI and wants to cast 10m votes, they have to create 10m wallets and transfer 1 UNI to each! Also, if we abolish delegates, the proposal requirements should change since it will be impossible to meet them. Most proposals have around 300-400 votes, so we suggest a Temperature check should pass with 150 votes after a 5 day period of voting time, a Consensus Check should pass with 200 votes after a 7 day period of time, and the Final Proposals should pass with 500 votes after a 15 day period of time. Of course the final numbers can be decided over a separate vote. You can VOTE for this proposal HERE: Snapshot Thank you for your time. ",

The post criticizes the current system, which is controlled by a few individuals with a large number of votes, and proposes a new system that requires voters to have at least 1 UNI in their wallet and limits each voter to one vote. The post also suggests changing the proposal requirements and outlines the voting periods for different types of proposals. The post is advertising the proposal and responding to potential criticism.",

You simply went ahead with your 4 million votes and shut down the proposal even though it had hundreds of people voting on favor. And thats exactly the point of THIS Proposal, so that never happens again! And the bribe was just to prove my point here. Shame you didnt take it because it would have proven this BROKEN system even more!! But what happens if theres a proposal thats asks for 20 million USD and bribes your 4 million votes with $1.000.000 USD or more??

Unless of course you are whale delegates yourself, and if thats the case, then why even have governance at all?? ",
