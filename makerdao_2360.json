                    "content": "With a large majority of participants voting in favor of trialing SourceCred to pay contributors (Signal poll), we are happy to announce the official start of the SourceCred trial! Starting today, SourceCred will be distributing DAI to community members based on their contributions to the Maker forum, including posts, replies and likes, with the intention of rewarding individuals for making valuable contributions (those which spark good discussion and receive lots of likes). This post provides a summary of the trial, instructions for participating, a tour of the Maker SourceCred instance, and a preview of payout amounts based on last week\u2019s activity. Further details, including how scores and payouts are calculated, can be found in Maker SourceCred Trial. SourceCred support I (@s_ben) will be the main point of contact for SourceCred questions. Feel free to ask any questions! Other SourceCred community members supporting the trial include @decentralion and @beanow. All SourceCred community members involved with the trial will be exempted from the trial, as will Foundation employees inside the community development department, or who otherwise have roles for which forum posts and community communication are considered \u2018part of their responsibilities\u2019 Maker SourceCred instance An hosted instance of SourceCred running on the Maker forum can be found here.  1038\u00d7564 78.5 KB  Here, you can view users\u2019 lifetime cred scores, as well as Topics that earned the most Cred in a given week, as shown below.  1600\u00d7851 189 KB  Trial Overview The intention is to run the trial for three months, distributing at least $5k worth of DAI each month according to Cred scores. Each week (every Monday), SourceCred will publish updated scores to the forum along with payout amounts, giving community members an opportunity to ask questions and raise any concerns. At the end of the month, contributors that opt in to receiving payments and have at least $10 in accrued payouts can redeem their balance for DAI. The balance available for redemption will be equal to the sum of weekly payouts posted to the forum. Instructions for Participation Opt-in To receive payments, you must opt in, as not all contributors want to assume risks associated with cryptocurrency payments. To opt in, please send a direct message to @sourcecred-trial-adm indicating your desire to participate in the trial and providing an Ethereum address to send payments to. Participants in the trial will have up to one month after the end of the trial (Sept 1st) to opt in and redeem their DAI. After that time, any DAI not redeemed will be returned to the Maker Foundation. Payouts OK, get to the payouts already! The Maker Foundation grants program will allocate $5,000 worth of DAI for distribution in the first month, split into four weekly distributions of $1,250. If results are positive, it may increase this amount. The actual amount distributed by Maker will be less than the total monthly distribution allocated, due to payments being opt-in and other exemptions. Trial Week 1 preview payouts (week ending May 31st) Below are a preview for this week\u2019s payouts for the top 20 contributors; these balances will be zero\u2019d out and started for real next Monday. Payouts are broken into \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d components, whereby 20% of the DAI distributed is based on Cred earned in the last week, and 80% is distributed as a function of lifetime Cred scores. This is designed to keep the algorithm responsive, rewarding new contributions and newer contributors, while also incentivizing long-term participation.  For full scores and payout data, see this observable notebook. If you have any questions or concerns related to the payouts or SourceCred in general, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask!

A lot of sites will simply create window with some name to open a new window and use that exclusively, or pop a new window every time. I was also curious how initial conditions were determined.   Meaning how do you determine something like a users influence (initial CRED value) to then use the CRED flow metrics to distribute it.    At some point I am going to sit down and look at the reference materials so if I have asked something here that is in those I apologize just refer me to them again. I am also posting here to bump this thread a bit to let people know if they are interested in getting some of the free DAI for forum participation - ya have to opt in with a wallet address for DAI to be sent to.   Fortunately on subsequent reading I see this doesn\u2019t expire until 1 month after the 3 month trial (Oct 1 I guess).   So people can wait to see how much DAI they might get before opting in. Not sure if you guys will do this or whether this is a forum feature but I was talking to LFW about sending PM\u2019s to people who have not opted in letting them know when they hit $50, $100, $200, $500 to claim.     MIght also be a good idea to pm people in the list that have > $10 DAI each week before their DAI expires on Oct 1 in September\u2026 I am sure I will have more as I dig into this a bit.   This should be an interesting experiment. ",

Have created an Issue suggesting we implement it. We\u2019re in the midst of a big UI redesign actually, which should give us something way better in a few weeks. So not sure the team will prioritize implementing it in the current UI, but we should be fixing this soon in some form.

PM\u2019ing people I think would be effective. My general idea is to give it a few days first, see what traction we get just from posting here. So far we have 9 opt ins (including you when I get your ETH address), which is a decent start IMO. I also think we\u2019ll see more interest as those DAI balances grow  I generally defer to @LongForWisdom\u2019s wisdom (badum bum) on promotion, but open to any ideas. ",

I\u2019ve been just manually replying to PMs to this address letting people know they\u2019ve been added.   Interesting I just clicked on the @sourcecred-trial-adm and then finally looked at the message it formulated \u201cFor MakerMan\u201d  so no I guess I didn\u2019t send a message to the correct user.     This might be a forum thing?   I have not used private messages here much and thought just clicking on a user would automatically create a private message to a particular user. I was just looking at the 25 minute video to learn up on SourceCred just because I have had an interest in the topic of \u2018trust\u2019 as well \u2018content value determination\u2019 for a while now. Thank you for the reply.  Yeah LFW was telling me that the UI was under serious rework.  I only posted just because it was on my mind and I like to do multiple things at once.  bumping this thread seems important now this is kicking off. Making an easy link for people to click on that constructs the pm would be even more helpful.  This is for a forum admin I think.   Either that or instructions if some are required.  I am going to double check a few things and then get back here to edit this with some more info. EDIT ADD: I just checked and clicking on the above looks like the forum picked another user here the first time. I generally have not used pm\u2019s much so never really looked at who it was sending to.   I did just check again by doing the same thing a second time (clicking on nickname above) to send another request to @sourcecred-trial-adm I actually tried to manually type in the correct user and the pm page simply would not allow me to do it.   I did verify it went to the -adm Regarding promotions I suggested to LFW that we just put it on CC agenda for a bit to just remind people the trial is on and it is an opt-in then just promo a link to this thread or something.  Like I said a easy link to opt in with a properly constructed message only needing a ETH address might help.   Clearly 8 other people figured it out.   I always seem to have the wierd stuff happen. I am excited to see the new frontend UI and am sure I will have some decent feed back once the new one kicks out for comments.   Feel free to ping me once your team has something ready for release but want alpha/beta feed back before the final release.   I can\u2019t say I will have time, but if I do, and have inclination, I will. EDIT END: ",

                    "content": "A follow up post to previous. The talk was a good intro.    The following paper linked above also a pretty nice reading intro pretty much answered my question regarding how the node cred is initialized and then calculated.   Not quite enough detail but i don\u2019t expect that out of an introductory paper. Do you have a link to a more advanced paper that shows in detail the math being used?   I\u2019m a bit curious how you guys handled the epoch\u2019s.   I guess it is similar to doing something like a blockchain state save rather than having to back calculate everything to determine the state at some point.  There is a lot here that is interesting but I find the concept of managing past cred states (and ofc grain payouts etc.) against current cred with the condition that cred or grain doesn\u2019t decrease is interesting.   How is grain used against cred to maintain this condition and what kinds of deficits are managed.   Also given that you are using something like a matrix formulation with eigenvalues to manage the cred you just renomalize the cred sum to be what you need for the cred growth you want?   It is not entirely clear to me the connection between cred and grain from this article. Even so I think the approach is interesting and definitely useful.  I found one comment in the video talk to be interesting and that is that if left alone the cred signal will be entirely gamed vs. ones where a more dynamic approach via management of the cred edge profile (can\u2019t remember the term you guys used for the cred configuration) by the community of interest.  I think this means that cred is a kind of decaying value component that has to be offset in some way by direct community management so it is isn\u2019t something you just get and keep even though a comment was that cred wasn\u2019t meant to decay like this.   (a contributor that makes a contribution that was not utilized for some time could still get cred later). One thing in my thoughts on this topic that comes up is the idea of relative age of contributions or their relevance.   There is two ways to deal with this that I think generally work:  Have cred have a decay rate - using the epoch slowly decay cred. Have contributors themselves put a cap on the amount of cred or grain they require before a contribution is considered \u2018paid\u2019.   This is a nice mechanism for contributions to formally enter the community with a previous value that disassociates from future value creation.  Conceptually while people would desire to make money off of contributions in perpetuity practically this doesn\u2019t work well.  examples are patents where at some point it is more beneficial to society for these patents to enter the \u2018public domain\u2019 vs. to keep someone paying a royalty etc to use them.    Timeframes on these things are important in relation to revenue generation against potential use and litigation processes.   One has to have potential to create enough compensation for the creation of something during the time frame the contribution is active for revenue generation. Using 1 to create a decay curve gives a longer time frame for something to generate revenue (even if small).   Using (2) above formalizes the completion of the compensation and transition into the public domain with a better time frame than (1).   Literally a single benefactor could then pay the contributor the amount in (2) which then would allow the contribution to enter the public domain. I am not sure if the decay or set value idea would help within sourceCred or even needed but these were things that came out of my research on this topic generally. I found it quite interesting the use of a common 80:20 division approach to the slow:fast cred modelling.    I like it as a simple easy to calculate approach that also probably could be arrived at by a cred decay model. Anyway those are my thoughts.   If there is a more mathematically rigorous paper on the SourceCred model please do post for those of us who are interested and have a solid math background.   Ultimately I could look at the source code and ferret out the math but find it easier to look at the math generally vs. looking at code to figure out the math. ",

But if you click on the distributionHistory.json link (admittedly hard to find), you can see your score:             {                 \"alias\": \"discourse/@hongbiao_li\",                 \"fast\": 118,                 \"slow\": 2             },  Keep in mind these raw numbers are not denominated in dollars, but cents. So your total of 118+2 = 120 = $1.20 worth of DAI. So, you will need to work a bit more to get to the minimum $10 in accrued DAI you need to do a redemption.

My knowledge of the algorithm is more high-level, but hopefully I can point you in the right direction.     MakerMan:  Do you have a link to a more advanced paper that shows in detail the math being used?   No more advanced paper yet, in part because we\u2019re undergoing a rewrite of the algorithm, called CredRank. The basic functionality and scores will be the same, but it will allow us to improve performance  (faster calculation and smaller output), better interpretability (i.e. we can answer more  questions of the types you propose) and flexibility (i.e. we can create features that enable more cryptoeconomic models).

Reading time: 2 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 7 \u2764          MakerMan:  I\u2019m a bit curious how you guys handled the epoch\u2019s. I guess it is similar to doing something like a blockchain state save rather than having to back calculate everything to determine the state at some point.   How epochs work is beyond me\u2026 Will ask the algo designers for input. As for state changes, we currently do just re-download all the data and recalculate the graph from scratch each time we generate new scores (state). The algorithm is fairly computationally intensive, so not something you could calculate on the Ethereum blockchain for instance (not 1.x anyway). One nice property of the Page Rank algorithm however, is that while it is expensive to calculate, it\u2019s very cheap to validate. And, CredRank will when merged significantly decrease runtime and output size. SourceCred does plan to launch Grain as an ERC-20 token, and is working on a Grain ledger that does a better job of automating accounting that is currently done in a more manual, messy way.     MakerMan:  There is a lot here that is interesting but I find the concept of managing past cred states (and ofc grain payouts etc.) against current cred with the condition that cred or grain doesn\u2019t decrease is interesting. How is grain used against cred to maintain this condition and what kinds of deficits are managed. Also given that you are using something like a matrix formulation with eigenvalues to manage the cred you just renomalize the cred sum to be what you need for the cred growth you want? It is not entirely clear to me the connection between cred and grain from this article.   As for Cred and Grain, I would think of them as separate things (for now anyway). When we implement Boosting, Cred and Grain will interact and affect each other. But for now, in SourceCred and the Maker trial, Grain (or DAI in Maker\u2019s case) is just distributed weekly based on Cred scores. You can think of Grain as immutable, which it will literally be once DAI payments go out on-chain, while Cred scores can change based on new data, re-evaluation of old data, and changes to the algorithm. How Cred and Grain interact depends on the cryptoeconomic model the project uses, and the design space there is large and relatively unexplored in practice. We have some really smart people exploring the theoretical possibilities though, for SourceCred and more generally. SourceCred has a #cryptoeconomics channel on our Discord you might find interesting. We\u2019re also interacting with the Token Engineering (TE) community (Discord), as well as with other researchers in the cryptoeconomics and governance realms. Back to the core algorithm, below is a \u201cpaper\u201d that explores how PageRank is applied. This will help you understand, for instance, the alpha parameter, one of the main \u201cknobs\u201d you can use to steer the behavior of SourceCred.

SourceCred does this by creating a 'Contribution Graph', a [graph] containing all of the contributions and contributors to a project, as well as how they are inter-related. It then assigns cred to every node in the graph, with [PageRank]-esque semantics such that cred flows along edges, accumulating at nodes that are connected to other high-cred nodes. Intuitively, contributions are important if they are depended on by other important contributions, and users are important if they are connected to important contributions.  The intention of this document is to rigorously describe the SourceCred algorithm, so that we can use it as a basis for discussing improvements and open issues with the system. This is a living document, and we intend to keep it up-to-date so as to describe the present operation of SourceCred's algorithm.  Pull requests welcome!     This file has been truncated. show original          MakerMan:  One thing in my thoughts on this topic that comes up is the idea of relative age of contributions or their relevance. There is two ways to deal with this that I think generally work:  Have cred have a decay rate - using the epoch slowly decay cred. Have contributors themselves put a cap on the amount of cred or grain they require before a contribution is considered \u2018paid\u2019. This is a nice mechanism for contributions to formally enter the community with a previous value that disassociates from future value creation.  Conceptually while people would desire to make money off of contributions in perpetuity practically this doesn\u2019t work well. examples are patents where at some point it is more beneficial to society for these patents to enter the \u2018public domain\u2019 vs. to keep someone paying a royalty etc to use them. Timeframes on these things are important in relation to revenue generation against potential use and litigation processes. One has to have potential to create enough compensation for the creation of something during the time frame the contribution is active for revenue generation.   This is another deep area of thought. There are many different \u201cemployment\u201d/economic models one could implement here. SourceCred is exploring a Sponsorship model, where a sponsor (e.g. Protocol Labs) agrees to pay a set dollar amount per month, in return for a share of the contributor\u2019s Cred, de-risking their income. Other models are being discussed. Which one is appropriate for a given project will likely depend on the needs and culture of the project. I agree that balancing rewards over time (temporal dynamcis), is one of the more important, trickier aspects. ",

                    "content": " Intro As some of you may be aware, myself and @rich.brown have been working with SourceCred to deliver a trial implementation of the SourceCred algorithm on the Maker forum. We hope that this will encourage high-quality participation and increased governance bandwidth. The details of this trial and the timeline moving forward can be found below. But briefly, the way this works is that weekly cred scores will be computed based on recent and historical participation on this forum, including posts, replies, and likes. The intention is to reward individuals for making valuable contributions (those which spark good discussion and receive lots of likes). The SourceCred team, primarily @s_ben (with support from @decentralion and @beanow) will be on hand to offer support and run the trial assuming it goes ahead. Given the potentially intrusive nature of this trial, it will only go ahead if confirmed via a forum poll. Assuming the forum poll ends favourably the intention is to run this trial for 3 months, distributing at least $5k worth of DAI each month, and allowing monthly redemption for everyone with a balance of at least $10. If this trial goes well, there are additional features and capabilities that SourceCred offers that can be investigated. The rest of this post has been written in collaboration with the SourceCred team.  Timeline 18/05/2020 - Trial Summary Forum Post 21/05/2020 - SourceCred Presentation in Governance Call 21/05/2020 - Confirmatory Forum Poll 31/05/2020 - Forum Poll Ends 01/06/2020 - Trial Starts (given poll success) 31/08/2020 - Trial Ends (given poll success)  Context Back in January 2020, in response to ongoing discussions around Maker governance overhead and how to compensate workers post Foundation, @s_ben proposed a new data source for consideration. This data source uses SourceCred, a reputation protocol for open collaboration, to score contributions on the Maker forum. Several people saw potential in the SourceCred algorithm to help to solve problems of incentivisation and participation in the Maker community. @LongForWisdom created a working group to explore a trial of SourceCred with the blessing of @rich.brown and reached out to members of the SourceCred community (@s_ben, @decentralion, @Beanow) who agreed to work with us on designing the trial. On Feb 23rd, a governance initiative was posted detailing these plans. SourceCred worked with the working group to design a controlled three month pilot trial, wherein Maker rewards contributors to Maker Governance on the forums using SourceCred \u201ccred\u201d scores. SourceCred will be given a development grant to provide technical support for the trial.  Trial Summary SourceCred believes it can incentivize governance work by providing an effective, decentralized and incentive-compatible way to value contributions. We will test this hypothesis by running a controlled pilot trial, wherein Maker rewards contributors to Maker Governance using cred scores. SourceCred will setup a cred instance based on the Maker Discourse forum. We will then run a three-month trial, distributing DAI to governance participants based on their cred scores. From an implementation standpoint, the cred scores will be calculated and published off-chain, and SourceCred will manually distribute DAI to contributors, these tokens will be sourced from the Maker Foundation community development fund. Results will be measured with a combination of objective and subjective metrics.  Benefits to Maker SourceCred hypothesizes that if cred scores can be used to pay contributors in a credibly neutral way, it should enable Maker to scale its contributor base without overwhelming current Foundation members, while also decentralizing decisions around valuing contributions. If the trial is successful, SourceCred also expects increased DAI adoption, because it will give other DAOs the ability to permissionlessly pay contributors they currently cannot, due to issues similar to those Maker is facing. At the end of the trial, it will create a report to share findings and best practices. Voting participation could be positively impacted, due to better content for MKR holders. Future experiments could also involve more directly incentivizing voting using SourceCred, for instance by providing an input to vote delegation mechanisms, or incentivizing a particular type of content.  Trial Implementation  Scores SourceCred, as the name suggests, is all about attributing cred. Cred is a metric that scores every contribution and contributor in a project, giving a sense of how important they were. SourceCred calculates cred scores using a modified version of the PageRank algorithm (what Google uses to rank webpages). Contributions are arranged in a graph, where contributors and contributions are nodes, and have edges indicating how they relate to other contributions. For example, if someone writes a reply to this post, there will be an edge connecting that reply to this post. Liking and referencing a post in other posts will also create edges. You can think of each edge in the graph as being a \u201cthank you\u201d. In general, SourceCred is designed to flow cred to a contribution when there is a review of that contribution (likes in the case of forum posts), rather than when the contribution is created. This reduces the danger of spam and reinforces the idea that contributors dictate what is valuable. See the Resources section below for more information on how cred scores are calculated. Scores will be published weekly on the Maker forum, and the SourceCred team will be available to answer any questions and concerns from the Maker community.  Payouts Payments will be distributed monthly, with the payout amount equal to the sum of the weekly published preview payouts. Contributors that do not opt-in will be exempted from payouts. This is because not all contributors will want to take on risks and costs associated with receiving cryptocurrency income. Opting in will require the communication of an Ethereum address to the distributor before the communicated closing date. The closing date and method for opt-in will be communicated before the trial begins. Contributors whose total payout is below a threshold of $10 will also be exempt. This will make the number of payouts more operationally manageable, and incentivize more meaningful commitments. The Maker Foundation grants program will allocate $5,000 worth of DAI for distribution in the first month. If results are positive, it may increase this amount. The actual amount distributed by Maker will be less than the total monthly distribution allocated, as payments are opt-in and certain categories of contributors are exempted.  Exempt Parties Those in the Maker-SourceCred trial working group are exempt for conflict of interest reasons. This includes the following users: @LongForWisdom @rich.brown @s_ben @decentralion @Beanow Foundation employees inside the community development department, or who otherwise have roles for which forum posts and community communication are considered \u2018part of their responsibilities\u2019 are exempt from this trial.  Fast and Slow Payout Components For calculating payment amounts, SourceCred will use a method developed during its internal dogfooding of SourceCred, which has now paid its contributors ~$400,000 worth of its native token, Grain. This method splits payments into \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d components. The fast component allocates directly based on each contributor\u2019s cred in the latest full week. This ensures that anyone who made a meaningful contribution during the week is rewarded, keeping the system responsive. The slow component is a function of lifetime cred scores and past payments, with an adaptive component that adjusts payments such that a contributor\u2019s total earnings are in line with their share of total cred. If there are no changes to past contribution weights (e.g. because the weights were changed to mitigate gaming, or some older contributions were revalued due to reflect new information), the slow component is equivalent to distributing according to lifetime cred scores. The amount distributed by fast and slow components is determined by a set percentage, with fast payments constituting 20% of the distribution, slow payments 80%. The section below provides more detail on the adaptive component of the slow payout.  Adaptive Component SourceCred uses a mechanism it calls \u201cunderpayment\u201d to determine allocations, as described below. The underpayment mechanism imagines a hypothetical world, where the sum of all DAI distributed during the trial was distributed according to the current lifetime scores. Based on this, we can calculate the \u201cfair\u201d lifetime earnings for each participant. Usually, some will be \u201cunderpaid\u201d (they received less than this amount) and others are \u201coverpaid\u201d. We can sum across all users who were underpaid to find the \u201ctotal underpayment\u201d. As an invariant, the total underpayment, before distribution, is equal to the total overpayment, as every token of overpayment to one contributor is underpayment for another contributor. Once we have calculated each contributor\u2019s underpayment, and the total underpayment, we divide the total tokens being distributed in proportion to their relative underpayment.  SourceCred Support The SourceCred Team will support the trial in the following ways:  Weekly reports on cred scores, posted to the forums, where community members can ask questions and raise concerns. Building moderation tools as needed to protect against attacks and gaming Updating UI and documentation based on questions and feedback Creating and processing subjective surveys Producing a final report for the Maker community analyzing results   Metrics  Success Metrics Success will be measured with a combination of objective engagement metrics provided by Discourse, and subjective feedback in the form of surveys for contributors and the Maker-SourceCred working group.  Cancellation Metrics The trial will be cancelled if either of the following become true:   The system is being overtly gamed to an extent that the Maker-SourceCred working group feels the experiment is harming the project, and SourceCred cannot address gaming via changes to the algorithm or other measures.   The Maker-SourceCred working group determines there is strong community opposition in response to the trial in progress.
