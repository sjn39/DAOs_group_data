It takes time to catch up, and the landing is not easy. I spent many hours reading and asking questions, and we can\u2019t expect everyone to do that so they can participate in governance without feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s like that in all DAOS. Optimism is in an early phase so I think it is worth it a little effort, but more structure information is needed. I was proposing some community bottom-up projects that motivate people like you (interested in governance) to participate. I came here because of the airdrop and I stayed because I love this:    Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective \ud83d\udccc Policies and Templates       That\u2019s an interesting idea     Sadly is complicated to do that without people coming massively to participate. Please stay and be a part of this. Stay tuned to the update on this project and make them yours too as a member of OP collective:    [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Entangled Optimism mDAOs - Cycle #8 Grants Council       Project name :  Entangled Optimism micro-DAOs  Author name and contact info  Discord: TheDoctor#9791 | Telegram: @ateneo1 (provisional author, any OP collective member with more reputation can contribute, modify or lead the proposal)  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes, and to any OP collective member who wants to check.
