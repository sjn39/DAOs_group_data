Vault is below liquidation price and hence a part of their collateral is put up for auction. Since no bids are in yet, we assume the collateral will be sold for 0 DAI and hence the surplus buffer has to bear the cost of this \u201closs\u201d but it isn\u2019t an actual loss yet. As bids come in, the highest bid on collateral exceeds the DAI borrowed using that at some point and that\u2019s when the surplus buffer is no longer going to be at a loss. As bids go even higher, the buffer goes into profit. When the auction concludes, we finally know the actualized profit (or loss if step 3 didn\u2019t happen). If MKR is burned, the buffer goes back down.  Is that about right? On a side note, 50k DAI went for 22.16 ETH in a few auctions - that\u2019s quite a lot lower than current ETH price! Guess we really need Liquidations 2.0 to remove this inefficiency. ",

With every step in the tend-auction, the amount of DAI covered by the auction rises - reducing the deficit in the System Surplus. If an auction get tended to DAI 44247 the loss for the protocol is covered, if it moves above that we also collected the penalty fee - resulting in a bonus for the System Surplus. In dent phase  the DAI is then auctioned for the collateral. So to sum it up: in tend the auctions finds out how much of the DAI will be covered by the liquidators instead of using the System Surplus, in dent we find out how much of the colateral will still be in the vault after the liquidation. All of the liquidations we saw yesterday  had a tend phase fully covering the deficit most of them even collected the full penalty fee (went to dent phase)  As keepers have to commit to a price for some time the bids in dent resulted in more collateral taken away from the liquidated vault. This is one of the main advantages of Liq2: Instead of bidding on a price that gets settled later, they basically buy some collateral and can recycle that in a single TX. Still noteworthy, that even in Liq2 a liquidation starts with covering the deficit through the System Surplus - as long as the outstanding DAI is not covered by a auction ",
