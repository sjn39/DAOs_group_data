Tooling committee, DeFi committee Project description: GYSR is a zero code launchpad for liquidity mining, NFT staking, governance rewards, token distribution, and much more. It makes incentives easier, more accessible, and safer for both the creator and the investor. The platform is decentralized, fully on-chain, configurable, and compatible with any ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. Project links:  Website: https://gysr.io/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/gysr_io  Discord: GYSR  Newsletter: https://gysr.substack.com/  Docs: https://docs.gysr.io/  Use cases overview: Use cases - GYSR documentation   Relevant Usage Metrics:  Transaction Volume: $1.5B TVL: $4M (down from high ~$50M) Pools: 460 Unique addresses: 5,400+  Competitors, peers, or similar projects: xToken Terminal (Uniswap v3 LM only) Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: May 31st, 2022 Ecosystem value prop / Optimism alignment: As the Optimism ecosystem is growing, we believe it\u2019s extremely valuable to have robust, open source platforms and no-code solutions for fair token distribution, liquidity incentives, and governance rewards. GYSR provides exactly that tooling layer. Our solution helps project teams save time and stay focused on building their own core tech. End users benefit from discovery of new opportunities and by interacting with a known, battle-tested platform. Read more about benefits here. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes, this is a resubmission and has been revised based on feedback in this thread    [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] GYSR Governance Fund: Phase 1       Thanks for all the great feedback everyone!  We have made some significant changes to refine this proposal. Most notably:   lowered total grant ask to 160,000 OP added more granular details to distribution plan and criteria for incentives allocated a portion of the grant to fund development of a new bond sale mechanism for more permanent liquidity provision added a new section on reporting and accountability plan for OP token usage (see Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects)  More \u2026     Number of OP tokens requested: 160,000 How much will your project match in co-incentives? GYSR will be offering up 100K GYSR tokens in incentives for distribution through the GYSR platform on Optimism. Proposal for token distribution: GYSR\u2019s goal is to help make Optimism an easy choice for developers and communities to deploy new projects or expand their current ecosystem beyond Mainnet. To accomplish this, we need to ensure that the communities surrounding these projects have the correct incentives and confidence to move to Optimism to take advantage of the scaling infrastructure and ecosystem tools. Further, we want to encourage projects to use GYSR in order to accelerate development speed, improve safety and security, and stay focused on their core tech. We\u2019d like to use the allocation in four ways:  Provide bonus incentives on top of GYSR Pools deployed on Optimism Incentivize migration of projects in the GYSR ecosystem from our other supported networks to Optimism Subsidize development of a new bond sale incentive mechanism for more permanent liquidity provision Offer small bounties to bizdev and community contributors for project referrals to GYSR on Optimism  How will the OP tokens be distributed?   60,000 OP (37.5%) to set up incentives for 3rd party Pools deployed on GYSR (on Optimism) for distribution over a year a. 5,000 OP per project funding over 50k USD in rewards locked b. 10,000 OP per project funding over 200K USD in rewards locked   40,000 OP (25%) to set up incentives for project migration to Optimism over a year a. 5,000 OP per project funding over 50K USD in rewards locked, with existing pool on GYSR mainnet or Polygon   40,000 OP (25%) towards new bond sale incentive mechanism tooling a. 15,000 OP towards development b. 25,000 OP towards audit costs   20,000 OP (12.5%) as bounty referral incentives a. 1000 OP per referral over 50K USD in rewards locked   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? For initiatives 1, 2, and 4, we\u2019ve planned for 1 year OP distributions to projects as we believe it\u2019s a long enough time horizon to keep users engaged, but short enough to offer meaningful returns. For initiative 3, this will be distributed over 90 days, aligned with a development sprint and audit. Note: any OP not earned by projects within 1 year for initiatives 1, 2, and 4 will be returned to Optimism governance. How will OP token usage be reported? (KPIs)   For every incentive distributed, we will provide on-chain documentation of a. Funding transaction by project that qualified for award b. Funding transaction by GYSR team adding additional OP rewards   For every incentive distributed, we will provide on-chain documentation of a. Original GYSR pool on another network b. Funding transaction by project that qualified for award c. Funding transaction by GYSR team adding additional OP rewards   To report usage of OP as a development subsidy, we will provide a. Open source release of developed smart contracts b. Published security audit report   To report usage for bounty referral incentives a. List of all referral bounties that have been paid out b. Total amount of OP distributed for referrals   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? GYSR is designed to make liquidity mining and other on-chain incentives extremely easy to set up. By offering side-by-side rewards and incentives on Optimism, it will encourage users to move their assets to Optimism for better return rates. Since GYSR acts as an add-on for many projects, this means that people coming to GYSR are not only leveraging the GYSR platform - they\u2019re interacting with DEXs, liquidity protocols, and more. That means users having breadth of usage on Optimism, not just on a single dapp. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The incentives we\u2019ve described are only augmentations to the GYSR Pools that are created. Come for the OP and incentives, stay for the projects that you engage with along the way. GYSR is a hub for many projects to provide their distributions but also users who come to GYSR use it as a source of discovery. Landing on the platform means connecting with projects you know and finding new ones to engage with as they launch which is not dependent on the OP being provided temporarily. ",

Your match is microscopic compared to the OP you\u2019re requesting. I think the amount of OP needs to be dramatically lowered for this to be remotely considered. ",

Since we\u2019re often used as a liquidity incentive for new projects and launches are down, it\u2019s reasonable that our TVL (and our token price) represents that as well. That being said, GYSR remains a battle hardened platform that has provided tooling for hundreds of projects with a proven track record of robust contracts and continued development.

Adoption of Gysr has been small though for a variety of reasons which reflects in the current market cap and consequently also in the value-add (vs. the Ask) to the Optimism ecosystem. Sidenote: We have been early users of Gysr, liked the gamified incentives for long-term sticky liquidity but saw crippling effects of l1 transaction costs. Hence, we see value in your push to Optimism. We generally like the proposal, would be happy to see Gysr on Optimism. We\u2019d recommend collaborating with launchpads, other projects enganging in liquidity mining on Optimism (See Phase 0/1 Proposals such as the dForce Proposal) and potentially do another proposal with a smaller ask in one of the next phases. *voted initially Abstain, and changed it to No to align this vote with our decisions on other proposals.

Proposal to stop Phase 0 Projects to submit new proposal in Phase 1 \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute the token while other does not. Here is an excellent summary by @MinimalGravitas .  Phase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token between Phase 0 projects. Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.  For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application.  For marketing and content creation (for example 80% Marketing proposal of Kromatika Proposal): - This depends on content creator(s), if they are \u2026     ",

I think one thing that could be helpful would be to break down your product line and at least share a close analog for each for reference.   Yeah you\u2019re right, their solution does overlap with one use case for GYSR (our Uniswap v3 liquidity mining solution with Arrakis). But GYSR pools can be configured for a very wide variety of use cases. Here\u2019s a page that outlines some common mechanisms and use cases on GYSR   docs.gysr.io    Use cases Incentive mechanisms: what you can do with GYSR          jackanorak:  My personal belief is that a year\u2019s too long for these types of things \u2013 even three months are plenty of time for LPs to get in place   Agreed, one year is on the longer side. Most liquidity mining programs we see start ~90 days (and usually extend). This is just being conservative with the OP part of the distribution. Another approach we\u2019d be open to is aligning the OP funding schedule with whatever period the project uses.     jackanorak:  What would be helpful would be some numbers demonstrating how this would be the case, expected rates, pool of capital likely to move, etc.   So we can give a lower bound on rewards here inherent to criteria for the distributions  worst case: 50K USD per qualifying project  100,000 / 5,000 = 20 projects overall lower bound: 20 * 50,000 = 1,000,000 USD (non OP) rewards adding the OP incentive: 1,000,000 + 0.85 * 100,000 = 1,085,000 USD rewards  Then we can estimate increase in staking value tied to those rewards  attractive staking APRs usually sit between 10% and 200% (depending on LP, single asset, risk, etc) -  let\u2019s call it 80% assume an average funding schedule of 90 days define apr = (rewards / staked) * (365 / period)  then staked = rewards * (365 / period) / apr  staked = 1,085,000 * (365 / 90) / 0.80 ~= 5,500,000 USD  This would bring the estimate to a total of 6.5M USD We would also propose that any liquidity incentives not earned within 1 year are returned to Optimism. This gives a guarantee on at least the rewards locked side.     jackanorak:  I\u2019d almost say that #2 should be the only reward of the two offered, as that\u2019s the only one guaranteeing new capital moving in in the first place   Beyond migration from other chains, I would say there\u2019s also a lot value in encouraging the use of safe/standard tooling for new and existing projects.     jackanorak:  Would love a description of this intended tool. Is this similar to Olympus Pro? And if so, what will the fee breakdown be?   The bond sale mechanism will allow users to purchase project tokens at a discount priced on a bonding curve. This lets projects acquire permanent protocol owned liquidity and other valuable assets. For technical context, within our modular pool architecture, it will be made up of a \u201cbond staking module\u201d + \u201cfixed reward module\u201d Similar to Olympus Pro, but totally open access and a bit more flexible on configuration, vesting, access controls, etc. We plan to start with zero or low protocol fee (~1%).     jackanorak:  Think what you\u2019re offering is great \u2013 I\u2019d at least personally love to see some more detail in what you\u2019re offering and in how OP grants unlock growth for everybody.
