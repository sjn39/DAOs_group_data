Why is there a wage premium in DeFi sector in the first place? It\u2019s largely due to how efficient the system is. MakerDAO as a system has more than 6 billion in TVL makes 88 mil profit per year. In legacy finance, they would have literally thousands of employees to keep that running. For MakerDAO, it\u2019s still below 100 core unit members if I am not mistaken. Another point to note is talents especially those that are familiar with blockchain and DeFi are very hard to get. And it\u2019s not just us as other DeFi protocols are facing the same issue. Talented devs are especially hard to find as they can also just split off and start their own projects / ICOs and will generally have no problem fundraising especially with previous experience at Maker (and we indeed saw many took that route and become successful). Now that doesn\u2019t mean the salary should be unlimited. There should be clear goal and also KPI and also mechanisms to punish or remove core unit members. However, trying to ignore the current market and thinking that the system that many talents put countless hours to build can be sustained by minimum wages is quite concerning and offensive. ",

In multinational companies, the same work is paid at different rates in different countries.  In principle, wages in a given industry are set at the prevailing wage level in that country. A multinational company will not pay US wages to anyone in a country with a lower wage level (maybe a few top managers who do the dirty work locally). If you look globally, the true value of labor cannot be fairly quantified because of the many different factors that determine its value. It\u2019s an interesting problem because there are no borders in crypto, so (in principle) only industry wages should be considered but that would be an oversimplifying statement. Even at the dawn of crypto, very smart guys put a huge amount of energy into it, while not knowing if their work would ever pay off. They believed in it, they did it, they created a whole new industry that is now completely immature and we are running into old/new problems like this issue. ",

The DAO was made up of people who volunteered the opportunity to play a banker, and now all of a sudden, volunteers demand compensation of upwards 2x to 3x the standard industrial pay in the US; probably 5x to 20x the standard industrial pay international.  This is unjustifiable and is setting a bad precedent which will cause DAO to become uncompetitive in the future when the core units eventually will expand by 10x or even 100x.  A check and balance should be implemented at the beginning in order to mitigate the risk of unrealistic expectations and cost overrun.  Check and balance is a complex issue that token holders do not have the capability nor the capacity of tackling.  This should be handled by a professional HR company/team that represents the DAO/token holders long term interest.  Therefore, I proposed DAO, either independently, or work with other DAOs, to contract a HR company to specifically tackle this complex issue. ",

The answer to why it\u2019s important to adjust wages to the price level in a given country is simply that the purchasing power of that amount is different in different countries. If we are talking about McDonalds salaries, then here -in the worse half of the EU- a McDonalds worker can only dream of 15-20USD/hour wages, because he/she would rather get 5-7 USD. And that\u2019s within the EU\u2026 Here is an older, but good study about a possible EU minimum wage policy.  If you scroll down to the 7. page, you can see that there is more than 10x difference between the lowest and the highest minimum wage. You can also see that they did not want to introduce a uniform minimum wage for all countries, but a minimum wage NORM, which \u201ccould establish minimum wages as a certain percentage of national median or average wages.\u201d But I don\u2019t want to mislead this discussion. Of course it\u2019s not about the specific minimumwages, it\u2019s about the wage ratios. I understand and appreciate the philosophy of equality, but let\u2019s not be under any illusions: competition will exploit the wage differentials to gain a competitive advantage over us with cheaper labour force.

However, if we show each other why and how the part of the world we live in works, we can - at the cost of compromise - create a well-functioning organisation in the long term. Creating a good code, it is the biggest job. Partially, its your job, and everyone who owns MKR / DAI has given you the confidence that you will do it well, whatever it takes.

I don\u2019t agree with this statement. I see so much discussion about the price/compensation levels for engineering talent. I believe that we pay the market rate for critical/strategic talent, whatever that might be\u2026and it\u2019s not only about engineers. Let me be clear, we are running businesses (core units) that need to achieve/deliver strategic objectives. Facilitators, leaders, product, marketing, biz dev, etc. of Core Units need to have MAJOR fucking experience (and outside of crypto) to pull off what we are trying to accomplish with this project. 95% of the people that we want to hire are not in this industry. Think about it. When you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a perilous place. I\u2019ve spend the last 30+ years in product and engineering delivery and what seems new is always something that has been recycled from the past. Decentralization is the way that people work together (communicate/collaborate) and hopefully, share some sort of common belief. It\u2019s simple and pure and lets keep is that way. I\u2019m curious, what is the fear here? I sense a scarcity mentality. To massively grow the Maker protocol, we need to think differently. And we need to move FAST! Pay and incentives are a rounding error at this moment in our growth. I\u2019d rather pay someone $200 hr than $20 since I expect more, way more, from people I hire. Personally, I don\u2019t care where you are at since I only care about value delivered. If you can do the job and produce results, so be it. To think differently introduces geographical biases which I don\u2019t buy into. ",

To complement on this topic, here is a post from a widely used ML library creator that puts a bit of perspective on the scarcity and race to the bottom mentality. If you can bring skills and experience that can make the protocol grow while being robust from both an engineering and risk perspective, then right there is the value you create. That value is compensated, regardless of jurisdiction. ",

A global labour market - a global wage level does not yet exist (I hope it will become a reality soon). For rapid growth we also need quantity of quality labour. As far as I know, Maker is currently facing a shortage of talented and skilled workers, as is the whole industry. As the available workforce becomes scarcer and more expensive, attracting new talent into the industry becomes an increasingly important priority. The question is: can we now afford to ignore global wage differentials in the current competitive environment, when our competitors will exploit them to grow cheaper and faster? Plus, the balance between wages and revenues must be maintained in the long term. Even if we talk about payments now in terms of rounding error relative to our revenues, will this still be the case later? ",

                    "content": "For me, we have to understand what we can influence today while staying laser focused on growing the protocol. The engineering community for smart contract engineers is relatively small and everyone talks. While some engineers will work more cheaply, the good ones know their value and will ask for it. Just about all of leading companies in the DeFi space are competing for the same engineers. That is our current reality and supports my prior comments. I\u2019ve hired product and engineering talent for several decades. A tactic to help with our hiring challenges is to recruit from outside of the crypto/blockchain industry. Sure there will be a bit more training upfront but it helps us increase the supply of engineers and just not draw off of the same pool that everyone else is using. I believe looking at this as a long-term program is in our best interest. It\u2019s why I am proposing two temporary slots in the CES core unit to help with this effort, MIP39c2-SP12: Adding Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit. The big question is, how do we attract and retain new engineers and other key people into our ecosystem? First I have to create opportunities which is a central concept of the CES core unit since we\u2019re not onboarding a fully populated team. Next, I have to provide market rate compensation, benefits, and incentive structures so that I can attract all levels of technical talent into our industry, and last, I need to reduce the risk for working in this industry. The last point is tricky since it\u2019s one thing to work for a startup (and most of us understand those risks), it\u2019s another thing to work for a startup in the DeFi/crypto industry. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m trying to build in some level of predictability in the CES core unit by working on cycles representing a quarter, 1/2 year, or full year. Plus, the early execution of most core units will be around establishing the core unit, hiring people, and learning how everyone will work together. Without growth, there isn\u2019t a conversation about what happens in the future. The best answer is, we\u2019ll figure it out. Why do I say that? I worked for Microsoft when it was a $400M USD company. I can\u2019t tell you how many millionaires (and billionaires) were minted in the following years due to the rapid growth of that company. Now we\u2019re in 2021. Are millionaires still minted at Microsoft? Sure but probably not at the same rate or timeframe as in the past. As companies mature, they provide many opportunities for solid talent to work at these companies with above average compensation and greatly reduced risk. If we execute correctly, we\u2019ll follow the same path. As a primary focus, it must be on scale and growth of the protocol. Let\u2019s focus on that vs. we only have a certain amount of money to spend. We can get more money to spend if we have to and thinking anything less is scarcity mentality. ",
