Sharing these here to get some input before we possibly turn these into guidance that we would share with all workstream leads. All thoughts/comments hugely appreciated.    BEFORE  Have an agenda before the meeting and share in the appropriate discord channel, preferably 30\u2019 before call Do not share editable Notion notes if possible but \u2018comment only\u2019 to avoid accidents    DURING  Assign a note taker at the start of the call, can rotate but not necessary RESPECT timing  Schedule longer if needed. Leave room for dialogue and do not go overtime. Migrate notes to Notion nested under Gitcoin DAO notion, ask access via Fred/Joe - great org work by MMM there! One platform for calls?  Ideal would be Jitsi (open source but not stable enough for larger groups. Own server worth it?) 2nd option: Zoom. (group acct available for recordings?) 3rd Google (=no recording/streaming)   Start recording all meetings  Assign one person to upload all to YT? (Jitsi works with streaming key = way easier)      AFTER  Add YouTube link in meeting notes Note taker shares meeting notes after the event in the chat    ",

I support the meeting-hygiene ideas but add 1 small request, which is kinda common sense: If someone arrive late to a meeting, please do your best to enter or exit the meeting silently (check audio settings) and do not ask the facilitator to repeat all the information you missed.  This is imo disrespectful to the rest of the participants & host. It is possible to get caught up on the notes or agenda without disturbing the meeting flow. ",
