The weekly exec still needs a good chunk of MKR to pass! Normally we wouldn\u2019t be worrying too much about this on a Monday, but today the Monthly Governance Cycle MIP is slated to go up as well. Delays could cause that and this upcoming Friday\u2019s executive to be delayed . Plus, this exec is chalk full of important protocol changes like adding YFI-A to Liq 2.0 , adding some burn  to our increasing Surplus Buffer, and keeping our rates and debt ceilings competitive  so we can continue on the Road to 10B DAI . And since they went over so well last time\u2026  MKR Holders do your thing! ",
