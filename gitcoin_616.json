                    "content": " Decentralized Bounty Platform Proposal to Gitcoin Bounty boards are centralized repositories of discrete tasks with an associated price tag for each job. De-bounty Platform (DB) is an interface to monitor the off-chain development progress of freelancers, and react to pre-set milestones with on-chain logic set by bounty providers. Bounties will be automatically delivered via a smart-escrow.  Abstract & Motivation Bounty boards have the potential to become the de facto form of labor organization in the cryptosphere by creating open labor markets. This is as DAOs are proliferating at an unprecedented rate and are able to derive high value from bounty boards: Opposed to hiring, DAOs typically utilize bounties to incentivize the community to complete various tasks in the form of tech development, design, PR content, metaverse building, etc. DAOs require platforms to manage these bounty interactions to help build trust between two, previously unfamiliar, people/entities. This proposal outlines a plan for Gitcoin to implement a decentralized bounty platform parallel to their existing bounty platform. This \u201cde-bounty\u201d platform (DB) will utilize Gitcoin bounty platform\u2019s frontend and EthSign Smart Agreement\u2019s backend to automatically fulfill the agreement outlined in bounties in a trustless manner. The intention of this proposal is to provide freelancers and bounty issuers with a decentralized means of issuing job bounties and automating compensation once the job is complete \u2014opposed to Gitcoin\u2019s existing centralized workflow. The reduction of potential bias from centralized entities \u2014repo owners & maintainers\u2014 via pre-set job terms and smart escrow enables freelancers and bounty issuers to enjoy more frictionless, trustless interactions. This proposal is in-line with the directives outlined in the following Progressive Decentralization governance workstream. DB Features Include:  Decentralized escrow service of bounty rewards Automated payment execution triggered by API Project milestones management dashboard On-chain records that provide a solid foundation for an identity verification & credit system Diverse bounty categories (technical development, operational tasks, DAO-related etc.)   De-Bounty Platform (DB) Specifications See Gitcoin Proposal: De-Bounty Platform Specifications for details on DB\u2019s workflow and features.  Road Map For this Development Phase 1 - 1.5 months, 4000 GTC Functionality  Front End  DID Integration (Torus, Metamask, etc) Project Management Dashboard IPFS + Arweave website Adapt Gitcoin front-end and UX to accommodate interaction with smart-escrow   Back End  Integrate Ethsign Smart Agreement Credit score for users based on on-chain record    Phase 2 - 1.5 months, 2000 GTC  User testing using Gitcoin DAO\u2019s and EthSign\u2019s communities Creation of Moderator DAO to be a jury-based dispute resolution system  Additional Features:  Multi-user claiming from the same bounty Integration of Discord Bot Plugin, a plug-and-play bot that facilitates issuer-freelancer communication, and allows for bounty creation, editing, listing, claiming, removal within Discord communities. Users are linked to their respective bounty URL to manage the bounty.   Drawbacks The largest drawback of DB is the issue of resolving disputes as bounty issuers must close the job repo determining whether the pre-set job term was met; this is especially true for complicated or non-binary jobs. DB includes a Moderator DAO to act as a jury-based dispute resolution system. Additionally, DB will assign credit scores, based on past job interactions pulled from on-chain records, to both bounty issuers and freelancers to discourage bad actors.  Implementation  Budget & Timeline: 6000 GTC from Gitcoin DAO. Use of funds: 2 contracted frontend developers and 1 smart contract developer over 3 months to integrate Gitcoin\u2019s frontend with EthSign Smart Agreement\u2019s existing backend, and to test the platform. Requests from Gitcoin: Access to code and design assets pertaining to Gitcoin bounty platform\u2019s frontend to create a Gitcoin-EthSign co-branded frontend. Assistance in creating and distributing PR materials relating to overviewing DB. Access to Gitcoin\u2019s DAO community for user testing.  Voting Yes - I agree to the above proposal to implement a decentralized bounty platform parallel to Gitcoin\u2019s existing bounty platform interface that monitor\u2019s the off-chain development progress of freelancers and reacts to a pre-set milestones with on-chain logic set by bounty providers. This proposal will be executed by EthSign\u2019s development team, and funded according to the \u201cBudget and Timeline\u201d above. No - I disagree to the above proposal and do not support the implementation of a decentralized bounty platform. ",

                    "content": "Hey all! Connor from Gitcoin Core here. Quick disclaimer and for context: I\u2019ve been part of a few discussions between Gitcoin and EthSign, the first back before GitcoinDAO was launched. Initially we spoke about using their Web3 enabled agreement signing product, and that evolved into discussions around how their tooling could be used to build a decentralized bounties platform. While we have not partnered together yet on anything officially, I\u2019ve watched the EthSign team and platform grow significantly over the past year. Gitcoin\u2019s first product launched in 2017 was bounties, and it remains a core part of the platform (+ backbone of hackathons and virtual events). The DAO is primarily focused on Gitcoin Grants, and I believe most of us agree the top priority is launching a permissionless decentralized quadratic funding platform, and turning cGrants into dGrants. I think the same should be done for cBounties to dBounties, but currently our teams and workstreams don\u2019t have the bandwidth to focus on it yet. With the explosion of DAOs, there is a great opportunity for the first (or best) open and decentralized bounty protocol to get widely adopted. Something that can integrate with Discord, gov forms, snapshot/tally, etc. With trustless escrow, verifiable milestones, arbitration, little to no fees. The current Gitcoin bounty platform is a bit outdated and sluggish, but the brand name and community are powerful. I believe this will take some time and warrants more discussion and fine-tuning, but if the DAO thinks it\u2019s worth funding, I\u2019d love to see what the EthSign team can build in collaboration with Gitcoin.
