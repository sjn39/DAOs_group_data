How do we translate this to the DAO ecosystem? Some ideas:  Acquiring governance tokens of different protocols  As a speculative treasure positioning As a mean of influencing on the protocol   Acquiring the talent behind the protocol  Ex: Reach protocol founders and fund their work aligning MakerDAO objectives, integrations, etc    This comes to my mind because QI DAO https://app.mai.finance/ is positioning itself as a \u201cMaker on polygon\u201d, and it\u2019s starting to develop a stable currency called MAI and several functionalities similar to Maker. As an example, in this scenario it could be an interesting opportunity for Maker to:  A) Buy QI tokens as a speculative hedge against competition B) Reach the QI DAO team and purchase the project, integrating their teams in the Maker ecosystem. C) Other ideas (?)  This also opens more questions, like, how to do multi-protocol governance, etc. I\u2019m pretty sure this is a bigger topic than this simple paragraph here. Just sharing some ideas, eager to listen to your thoughts. ",

But usually, it\u2019s been more of partnership than acquire in traditional sense. For example, Yearn team announced that they \u201cacquired\u201d projects but in reality, it\u2019s partnership rather than taking over their leadership. There are some cases where protocols might for example, via yield farming, gets large share of the governance token (Yearn and StakeDAO having large Curve (CRV) token). Considering MakerDAO community has been exploring potentially deploying USDC in PSM into DeFi to yield farm, that might be possible scenario. ",

Or in this case it could be a trustless scenario, for example, acquiring via a vested reward for X yeards, and it requires the approval of a vote to be changed, for example. So a team could collaborate with the DAO in exchange for some rewards, and this collaboration could be monitored by some agents, as another unit of the DAO. This in this area, and about acquiring governance tokens from another DAOs, i think is also really interesting. I think a mix of :  Acquiring governance tokens Approaching the team to stablish partnership and collaboration Create some incentive for a long term collaboration  Edit: I also like Yearns approach and their collaboration with CRV / etc. All that ecosystem is flourishing ",
