                    "content": "Lately there has been more and more discussion surrounding CU budgeting. This affect both existing and newly proposed CUs. Against a backdrop of falling revenue and increasing expenses it is normal that an organization starts going through existing and planned expenses with a more critical view to avoid running a deficit or at least have an expectation of eventually turning a deficit into a surplus. In many ways a parallel discussion has been a desire to increase our surplus buffer to be prepared for riskier growth projects. Defining a budget process quickly runs into several competing elements that needs to be balanced:  Ease of comparing different budgets to each other Governance overhead of evaluating a growing number of budgets The ability to make meaningful changes to a budget vs. the need to avoid micromanagement and respecting CU autonomy. The need for oversight vs work demand on reporting and evaluation. The risk of providing CUs with too many funds that remains unused and unreturned vs keeping efficient operation, and the need for frequent additional budget requests. Over- or underutilization of a given core unit given their budget, especially for core units that primarily serve other core units.  Balancing all these elements against each other can be considered a wicked problem*. There isn\u2019t a single correct answer. We must however try to reconcile the different considerations into a meaningful compromise. Strategic finance recently did a great job of producing budged process amendment proposal. While I believe this represents a step forward and should be implemented, I think it still puts a heavy governance burden on the protocol. One that is only going to increase as more core units gets onboarded. I think there are some other options to explore to encourage budget discipline and ensure resources are spent more towards value adding activities.  Indirect financing After the discussion about support CUs I think there is room to discuss if this kind of core unit is better suited to being financed indirectly. Indirect financing would mean that the DAO does not give this type of core unit a direct budget, or at least nothing more than a minimum budget and the rest needs to be generated as revenue by selling services to other core units. This will make sure that only services that are wanted by the community are being funded. Obviously, this will remove a fair bit of security from this category of core unit which will have to expend effort to remain employed. It does also mean that overarching protocol needs might go unheeded, but those could be funded more directly. Examples of this could be ensuring standards or policies.  Competition Part of the rationale for being organized as a DAO is redundancy. Redundancy can also be used to foster competition between core units vying for the same purpose. If we can establish parallel CUs and make sure no single core unit gets to do all the work in an area, we could create a state of natural competition that will cause downwards pressure on budget proposals. At the same time, we would be able to maintain core unit autonomy and avoid governance overhead because we would only need to compare the offers presented without a more detailed analysis of the components of the budget itself. It could also help focus the protocol by making sure that the requirements are stated prior to an offer is being made. As with most solutions this one isn\u2019t perfect and is also a matter of compromises. Pros  Greater focus on objectives as they are now set at the protocol level. Increased cost control as core units will have to be attractive to win bids for work Better redundancy as other core units can step up and replace others should they cease to function. Less focus on micromanagement of CUs and detailed budget proposals. Increased CU autonomy.  Cons:  Increased governance overhead in developing objectives. With individual core units reduced in size they will presumably be less capable of independently move the protocol forward. Less security for the core units might lead to detachment from the protocol.  This is not meant as a definitive answer but as a possible direction to further analyse and discuss. Talking about how to reduce costs are never easy but something needs to be done. Hopefully we can reach some form of consensus. *As in complex problem Wicked problems revisited - ScienceDirect ",

                    "content": "@AliceinMKRland Essentially yes. For Core Units already in existence it makes sense to do a reduction in that particular Core Unit\u2019s budget and at the same time approve amended budget requests from CUs that used the services. This might also save us issues like we had with GovComs being left without services when Content got offboarded. I think it is wise to retain a skeleton crew to be able to accumulate operations experience and to ensure a close integration to Maker, but the majority of funding should come from demand from the core units themselves. I do not envision a 1-1 reduction/increase however as that would imply a perfect balance in demand and capacity in existing Core Units. Running a Core Unit requires a certain amount of supporting services, like hiring, accounting, and legal services. With enough demand it makes sense to have our own supporting core units serving these areas. Given growing expertise of Maker in particular and DeFi and DAOs in general there might even be room for these supporting core units to serve other projects. For an example lets go with Data Insight. Their budget proposal is coming up soon. Right now they are gathering data and making it accessible for various core units and Maker at large. Instead of approving their budget as asked they get approved a marginal budget covering the work needed to serve Maker at the protocol level. At the same time, Risk, Protocol engineering and others asks for a budget to cover their need for accessible data. Then Data Insight makes their own deals with those core units for the scope of their work and the compensation required. This relieves the protocol level of determining what is the correct amount of support for the core unit level. ",

These are my thoughts but we should be careful to embrace and fall in love with our own ideas without discussing their merits and flaws with others first. It does however reflect my view that in general costs in core units needs to come down. As reductions in costs are painful for everyone involved I do not expect core units to warmly embrace these ideas, but the Maker community extends beyond the core units. If you are thinking in the context of that concrete example then it would be natural to ask the core unit in question to come up with a transition plan as well as having them ask other relevant core units which ones might be interested in buying their services.
