                    "content": " Introduction Hey everyone  On behalf of the DUX team  I\u2019m happy to share another quarterly update on our roadmap. The intention here is to share an elaborate forum post and pre-recorded walkthrough every three months, in which we\u2019ll wrap up the past quarter and commit to a focus for the next quarter. We\u2019ll touch upon prior commitments and the progress we\u2019ve made, lessons learned, and the prioritised themes for our roadmap. Enjoy the read and please do reply below if you have questions or suggestions!    Instead of reading, also consider watching the recorded walkthrough below in which I\u2019ll talk you through this update.        Looking back: Q1 2022 It\u2019s been a good quarter for our Core Unit overall. We were able to do meaningful work, deepen our collaborations with other Core Units and further map out our roadmap based on where MakerDAO is going. In addition to the above we\u2019ve had a fantastic team offsite in Denver, CO mainly centered around the ETHDenver conference.   For those who are not yet familiar with the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit, please head out to our Notion website.   What we\u2019ve committed to At the start of this year we defined our roadmap focus for Q1, which was centered around the following three themes (and one added \u2018surprise\u2019):  Security  Scalability  Interactivity  (Landing page) In the list below you\u2019ll find the features/initiatives that we committed to specifically.  Q1 &#39;22 commitments960\u00d7540 217 KB   What we\u2019ve delivered I\u2019ll start with the juicy bit; for sure we\u2019ve overpromised\u2026  Looking back I think the prioritised themes made a lot of sense, but for some of the features/initiatives on this list I failed to estimate the amount of research and/or development efforts these would entail. We were able to deliver on the most important items (or at least make some good progress on them), but some of these items were left unstarted.    Please refer to the recorded voiceover for an elaborate rundown of each item\u2019s status!  \u2026or get a sense of the progress by looking at the list below.  draft Roadmap spotlight Q2 &#39;22 (6)960\u00d7540 217 KB  All full release notes can be found here on our Notion website. Here\u2019s a list of the delivered features since January 1st.  Q1 &#39;22 delivered list product960\u00d7540 181 KB  Here\u2019s a quick overview of delivered work outside of product updates.  Q1 &#39;22 delivered list other960\u00d7540 191 KB   What we\u2019ve learned I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019re running a lot smoother and more efficient compared to Q4 '21. We\u2019ve grown closer as a team, our processes have reduced friction & overhead, and overall we\u2019ve found a dynamic that works. However as a fresh Core Unit (ratified September '21), we\u2019re still learning and adapting. Our biggest learnings from past few months are listed below.    Don\u2019t overpromise on quarterly roadmap\u2014focus and deliver!   Real impact is achieved through (complex) cross-CU initiatives.   Our product roadmap needs to be in sync with MakerDAOs trajectory and other CUs.   We\u2019re happy with the Immunefi bug bounty program but we need to actively contribute to refining its scope and process.      Please refer to the recorded voiceover for an elaboration on each of these!   Looking ahead: Q2 2022  Roadmap focus These past weeks we have been working to shape our roadmap for the upcoming three months. The intention was to align the roadmap with our sense of MakerDAO\u2019s current priorities, ongoing/planned work at other Core Units, and what\u2019s currently in progress at DUX. The resulting selection feels like the most relevant and impactful thing to work on, in addition to ongoing non-product-related initiatives. Once again; refer to the recorded voiceover for more details on each of the items included below.   draft Roadmap spotlight Q2 &#39;22 (5)960\u00d7540 177 KB   Wrapping up I\u2019ll close off by saying we\u2019re proud to be part of this community and excited about the initiatives happening behind the scenes. As the project finds its way to success we\u2019ll remain flexible as a product team and continuously adapt our team\u2019s focus to whatever is important to MakerDAO. For now; we\u2019re heads down on our way to the next Governance Portal release.  Lastly, as always\u2026   Feel free to engage with us in the comments below in case you have any feedback, questions, feature requests or ideas for Maker\u2019s governance tooling or process.   Thank you for reading!  ",
