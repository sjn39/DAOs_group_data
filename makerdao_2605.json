Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters PAX Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 120% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai USDT Risk Premium: 8% Liquidation Ratio: 150% Debt Ceiling: 10 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai Overview Metrics and Analysis DeFi Presence USDT is the second most popular centralized stablecoin in DeFi, behind USDC. USDT is also directly related to the Dai price, as it is present in both the Y and sUSDv2 pools on Curve, which is currently an important Dai trading venue. PAX has an extremely low presence in most popular financial applications on Ethereum, suggesting that DeFi is foreign to PAX users. Consequently, we expect very low Dai generation and low impact from PAX. USDT on the other hand is a systemically important asset in the general crypto market and is likely to see some utility within Maker. Compound and Aave, the two largest lending markets do not allow USDT to be used as a collateral type, which currently have 24.4m and 54.26m deposited respectively. In the following table we see a striking difference between the two stablecoins in terms of DeFi presence. 998\u00d7463 53.4 KB Volatility USDT has shown much higher price volatility over time when compared to PAX. In late 2018 USDT traded briefly under $0.96. In recent months however USDT has been significantly more stable. PAX has exhibited very little price volatility since inception. Since the start of 2019, USDT and PAX daily price volatility was 0.26% and 0.08% respectively. 1200\u00d7630 42.7 KB Daily Volume Traded The below chart illustrates the volume traded for major stablecoins in 2020. USDT volume traded is several orders of magnitude higher than other stablecoins. PAX, on the other hand, is one of the lowest traded centralized stablecoins in the space. 1600\u00d7953 262 KB Supply Growth USDT is present on multiple blockchains, but the overwhelming majority is issued on Ethereum, Tron and the Bitcoin Omni layer. Tether increased supply by 5.89b units or 143.38% YTD with 12.77% average monthly growth rate. Paxos increased supply by 20.6m units or 9.2% in the same time period. 1200\u00d7695 41.6 KB On-chain Transactions USDT onchain transactions have been steadily increasing over time, while PAX transactions have been declining since May 2020. In 2020, the USDT ERC-20 and PAX average daily transaction count was 147k and 9k, respectively. 1200\u00d7663 39.6 KB Median transaction value In 2020 the average daily median transaction value was 455 and 90, respectively. 1200\u00d7665 87.7 KB Source: Bloxy.info Regulatory & Counterparty Risk PAX  Operated by Paxos Trust Company, LLC, formally ItBit Trust Company, LLC (Jurisdiction - US-NY). From PAX website: \u201cCustomer funds are held in segregated accounts at FDIC-insured, U.S.-domiciled banks.\u201d Approximately 50% of existing supply is held in addresses controlled by Paxos. Paxos is the main asset used in \u201cMMM BSC Global\u201d, a suspected ponzi scheme. From PAX Terms and Services: \u201cAs part of the ERC20 smart contract and as part of the Services, the Company has the ability and the right to freeze and upgrade all USD Stablecoins tokens (on an aggregate basis), regardless of where the USD Stablecoins are being held. The Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior notice of any material freeze or upgrade and inform holders of USD Stablecoins of the reasons and consequences of such freeze and/or upgrade. The Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to use the freeze and/or upgrade feature only under limited circumstances.\u201d On-chain blacklists: 1 address frozen as of this writing.  USDT  Tether has a complex ownership structure and is closely related to Bitfinex. There are several companies and individuals involved, Tether International Limited, Tether Limited, Tether Operations Limited, Tether Holdings Limited and others. The Bitfinex officials are also responsible for setting up the Tether company structure, which is the link between the companies. Due to lack of relevant expertise, we choose to omit any legal risk analysis surrounding the company structure.  From The Rise of Stablecoins: \u201cAround the same time, some concerns began to emerge about Tether. The Paradise Papers, released in November 2017, revealed that Bitfinex officials were responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited, which owns Tether Limited.\u201d In 2019 the New York Attorney General\u2019s (\u201cNYAG\u201d) office filed a suit alleging that Bitfinex used Tether reserves to cover $850 million in lost customer funds. Bitfinex claimed that Crypto Capital, a financial services firm offering shadow banking services for several cryptocurrency businesses, defrauded Bitfinex out of the $850 million. Court filings revealed that, consequently, Tether only held $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalent securities. This figure implied that each USDT was backed by only $0.74 instead of a full $1. In the weeks following the NYAG\u2019s filing, Bitfinex conducted a $1 billion token sale for LEO, the proceeds of which, we presume, went to pay back the Tether reserves.   On-chain blacklists: 43 addresses frozen as of this writing.  Oracles and Liquidations  Given USDT\u2019s historical price volatility and opaqueness, the USDT price will use live oracles as opposed to a fixed price of $1. Consequently, liquidations will be enabled for USDT. PAX, however, is significantly more transparent and we recommend using a fixed oracle price of $1. Liquidations will also be disabled.  Risk Parameters PAX Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 120% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai USDT Risk Premium: 8% Liquidation Ratio: 150% Debt Ceiling: 10 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai Due to USDT\u2019s noted history of opaqueness and fractional reserve, we recommend an initial LR of 150%. This is the only parameter that can protect Maker in the instance where these risks materialize again. Additionally, since currently no other large lending protocol allows USDT as a collateral asset, there is potentially large demand waiting to flow into Maker from other protocols (~78.5m). Generating Dai against USDT could be an attractive avenue towards yield farming. Additionally, a future change to a lower LR is always possible and can be done smoothly. The opposite, however, is not true. Given that Maker would be the first significant DeFi application offering collateralization against USDT, a conservative risk premium to start should also be considered. We suggest 8%.
