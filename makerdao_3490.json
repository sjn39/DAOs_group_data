It is not that we are missing out a huge portion of the possible fees just for this short period for time.

The referred increase of 8MM on PAX-A would have generated 8k of fees (assuming tin of 0.1% like we have on PSMUSDC). That\u2019s peanuts. The message we send out by doing that is: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have you here\u201d. We onboarded PAX for a reason, and as long as we don\u2019t have a corresponding PSM the negative message to the outside world does outweight the lost fees. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am all in for setting DC to 0 on all 0%-stablecoin vaults, but only as soon as we have a corresponding PSM for it. USDC-A shows that this does work pretty good, almost half of the DAI generated from it has been payed back (replaced by PSMUSDC) since we set the DC to 0. This will happen with PAX as well. ",

For some reason I thought the running signal request was by default 1 week, I will adjust next time. The main reason of this signal was due to the anormal increase of pax and also the fact that we sort of let the DC as where it was before the PSM. Now that we are nearly half way to the top, it is probably not that important anymore. However I think we need to do something about it as the current setup provide either a way to by pass the PSM and get the fees or an insurance against pax for free. Both on our expenses.
