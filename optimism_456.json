(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiments Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): The traditional music industry is not bad, but i wonder why many artists always have issues with their record label at the end of the day, especially in Africa. Well i\u2019m related to thousands of them and I can understand their experiences. Many of them ends up depressed while still in contract, because the label determines when to drop their songs, some are already broke cos they are not making money again & cant be in the street to hustle because of their reputation, many are secretly looking for a way out, this experience is what i can also relate with. Which made me realise, lowkey everyone wanna be independent but doesn\u2019t have the resources Its time for me to announce to my fans and other celebrities that Optimism collective cares, and wanna make creating of audio NFTs easy for them which they can always build & earn their royalties on OPC and even also make local transactions with Optimism. This project is driven to introduce Afro beat music to this ecosystem as we all know Afro beat is currently one of the biggest genre of music in the world today, and Africa on the hand have one of the largest web3 market in the world, the objective of this project is to onboard independent artist from Africa into creating Afro beat Music NFTs to be minted on the OPC stores.Milestone: Onboarding 4000 Afro beat Independent Artist from Africa into this community.

Onboarding Afro beat Artist to lit up this ecosystem would be one of the biggest step taken by this ecosystem, because this artist brings global sounds that can provide sustainability to this this ecosystem Going through top NFTs on Open sea, I hope to see great musical NFTs from this ecosystem becomes global ventures With experience and creativity here on web3 music success is inevitable, and for the record, am the brain behind the most rated Near Anthem 2022. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Other than just creating contents we intend to use individuals that are exclusively talented in their fields to bring the best in them, we live in a world where the most talented minds are the most unprivileged, so our scouting team will be in charge of scouting those exeptional talents that can take this blockchain to a more greater height, look how musically afro beat is taking Nigeria as a country to greater level in the music industry, this is achieved by some set of talented individuals, relating this to Optimism now that\u2019s where This Project comes in. We scout, develop and create. This artist will produce quality afro beat, to be minted, & promoted all round web 3. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: In the year 2022 Afro beat music brought alot of investors, collaborations and awareness to the Near protocol, gracing them with their most rated Anthem. This year I plan to introduce Afro beat here in this community with bigger and better objectives for the growth of this ecosystem. It has been a dream for me to introduce a life changing musical project and I\u2019m glad for this opportunity to make my dreams com through. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: This is my first proposal, been strategizing our road map since October 2022. Number of OP tokens requested: 20,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: None How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Okay How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) 100% - 20,000 OP   user onboarding incentives, 5 $OP per user completing onboarding flow inside of OPxM community with a total: 4,000  (!) Musicians across Africa onboarded into Optimism ecosystem until September (2023). we\u2019ll explore other ways to fund operational budget.   A distribution channel  have been shedule on Quest3 to distribute rewards to user incentives.   We already have an active community on discord and telegram working to engage the onboarded artist to optimism      Discord   Discord - A New Way to Chat with Friends & Communities Discord is the easiest way to communicate over voice, video, and text.  Chat, hang out, and stay close with your friends and communities.      Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: It\u2019ll take 2 weeks We expect the distribution of OP tokens to take place over 8 weeks, to allow time to adjust. This time is needed incase of any necessary adjustments, and to be handled with full transparency, that is why we have flexible timeline of 8 - 9 weeks Milestone   25% grant payout after successfully testing of incentivised OP onboarding integration inside of Quest3 (so we\u2019ll have enough funds to start the incentivised onboarding campaign)   25% grant after successfully onboarding first 1000 talented musicians with $OP incentives   25% grant after successfully onboarding 2000 afro beat singers across Africa with $ OP incentives   25% grant after successfully onboarding lastly 1000 talented musicians across all globes with $OP incentives   Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable:   4000 music Artist onboarded to Optimism   Global content that is capable of becoming a global hit   To become a stable music NFT distributors hailing from this ecosystem      Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We will become the most sophisticated and curated Web3 music platform managed by this community. We will create a lot of Public Good, value in form of music, metaverse spaces, cypher, collaborations workshops, metaverse events and physical products. We want to make this platform social and a global prospect. Our last metaverse event was a blast on the metaverse,      We believe that Optimism will continue to be the top Layer-2 scaling solution and more opportunities will be created on Optimism in the future from the establishment of this project. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Instagram Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

I love your project and we definitely need more web3 creatives who are musicians on Optimism. There are a few things you should take note of when applying for a grant. First off the format of distribution. There are no percentages allocated to different initiatives related to user rewards/ marketing/ liquidity which is what is taken into account when reviewing a proposal for a growth experiment grant. Second there is no justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. These grants need a structured time frame with a plan on how the impact compared to profit will be made over that time period. That should be displayed clearly to other delegates here in order to be considered. -Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: It\u2019ll take 2 weeks - This description is very vague and does not describe any sort of achievements or milestones, along with some sort of plan for how exactly the tokens are being distributed.

If any particular type of dApp is preferred, we can work with the OP governance to further decide what kinds of apps receive a certain amount of the allocations. 3, 20% of the OP tokens will be allocated to the cost of marketing, operational teams, and community support required to ensure things run smoothly. No OP will go to paying the core development team or padding a DAO treasury, only to growing the OP ecosystem. OP is known for high value, and all members will receive instructions on governance participation. The profits generated by our NFT store will go back to the community treasury. And also secondly.

And then the third week we will launch the incentive program for new Artist  Onboarding hundreds of Web3 music Artist all around the globe. our scout team have been exceptionally well in that too, we will onboard them and open the interactive floor on discord, Week 4-6 this weeks will be a music production stage, where Artist we\u2019ll be giving platforms to produce a single track each, this track will be 100% creatively unique and we\u2019ll have them minted on the OP store before marketing. Week 7 & 8  The board selected to distribute the OP tokens received in this grant will evaluate the activity levels of the  this project. And finally we will distribute incentives according to activity and prepare a transparency report that will be made public upon completion. ",

Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) 1, 50% will be used for contributors salary payment This will be used to pay contributors salary all through the project run time. 2, 30% will be distributed into New dApp like Tamago streams and interact directly with the Optimism ecosystem. If any particular type of dApp is preferred, we can work with the OP governance to further decide what kinds of apps receive a certain amount of the allocations. 3, 20% of the OP tokens will be allocated to the cost of marketing, operational teams, and community support required to ensure things run smoothly. No OP will go to paying the core development team or padding a DAO treasury, only to growing the OP ecosystem. OP is known for high value, and all members will receive instructions on governance participation. The profits generated by our NFT store will go back to the community treasury.   Hey @WizPrince1 - These expenses are not allowed under the Optimism no-sale rule. Operating expenses / etc will need to be paid by the protocol, and cant be paid with OP tokens. ",

                    "content": "@WizPrince1 please explore options for token distribution that have been used by other NFT projects on OP\u2026 I suggest Quest3 which is free to set up you can also get a checkmark verification for your community\u2026 Then you can do a distribution schedule with some sort of proof of work to verify human identity for the people that are in your Network or part of the Dao. You can also create off chain and on chain requirements tying into the other platforms that you wish at and there are a ton of different options that already exist with Quest3 already. Another thing I suggest for your project is some sort of integration with GUILD to provide token gating and also keep track of snapshot integration or Dao  membership. I see that the OP attestation station also has an integration with guild. We love  guild and have helped as Beta testers for their security protocol which is blockchain agnostic. There are many integrations with this protocol which is a great Web3 security protocol for different use cases. Using the OP tokens for reward distribution will help with the activity and membership requirements within your community as well as a social media presence that is driven by the activity of the members who are active! You can also direct the funds from the quests that are set up directly to the retroactive public goods funding which is something we have done as well!!! This is a really great way to give back to optimism for creators who\u2019s values align in a similar fashion and we have many different models that vary from this one we have experimented with so if you need any other help brainstorming please let me know I hope these suggestions help you with the revision of your grant and that you can amend it in a way that will get you approval. If you want to get development funding I suggest taking that out of this grant application\u2026 You can apply for the builders grant but please understand there\u2019s a 12 month token lock so you have to follow through on the distribution of the tokens after that time period with the initial intention of what you have laid out and the proposal\u2026 You can also apply for a grant through the foundation as a new project.
