Amounts listed below on each option are the season 14 budget request without reserves).\n\n\nHOW VOTING WILL WORK\n\nSelect the option that you think FDD should be funded based on the initiatives below. A vote for option 1 would count towards each lower funding option until one is selected.\n\nFor example\n\noption 1 has 1 million votes (Not enough)\noption 2 has 1 million votes (Counted as 2 million votes including option 1 - still not enough)\noption 3 has 1.5 million votes (Counted as 3.5 million votes including 1 & 2 - This passes)\noption 4 has 2.5 million votes (Enough to pass on its own, but the higher level is passed)\n\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\n\nOPTION 1 - Fund FDD request $390,000 season 14 budget\n(40% reduction from original request)\n\nOPTION 2 - Fund FDD $330,000 and signal they should not perform a discovery 4 of a sybil detection / Passport DAO\n(49% reduction from original request)\n\nOPTION 3 - Fund FDD $200,000 to continue round operations but not support innovation or round to round improvements.\n(69% reduction from Season 13)\n\nOPTION 4 - Do Not Fund FDD\n(100% reduction from Season 13)\n\nOPTION 5 - Abstain\n\n\nTLDR\n\nWe have participated in governance and lowered our budget request to provide a lean FDD working to make grants 2.0 transition a success. The full funding request includes the original 40% reduction requested. We encourage stewards to fully fund FDD with option 1.\n\nOption 1 & 2 are fundamental differences on the timing or need to launch a sybil detection DAO that focuses on Passport adoption and utility. Ideally, GitcoinDAO would own 20-50% stake and have a 10% aqueduct commitment.\n\nOption 3 is a vote against the current team or roadmap for FDD. It is a signal that you do not believe funds are or will be used effectively, but know that GR14 requires some level of fraud detection & defense work.\n\nOption 4 is a vote against FDD existing.\n\n\nHigh Level Budget Breakdown\n\nSeason 14 Budget Total = $x*\n\nPLUS Season 15 Reserves = (x*1.6777)\n\nTotal Needed = $x + (x*1.6777)\n\nMINUS Current Reserves = TBD* (110k GTC or approximately $254k)\n\nTotal GTC Amount requested at this time = TBD*\n\n*The total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally.

I believe that the structure of the FDDs Budget Proposal should be a model that other workstreams could//should follow. It\u2019s a clear win-win scenario for the DAO and also the respective workstream. The stewards understand what they are funding and the workstream understands the picture that the stewards want to paint. This will only lead to evolution. As a DAO contributor and and FDD SC member I know how important the FDDs work is for the grants program and the DAO. I wish others would realize that and the fact that the FDD wanted to evolve to better solve some of the emergent and also unsolved recurring issues around sybil protection, credible neutrality and legitimacy.

(Most likely FDD contributors, but we would need to know exactly which tasks were requested.)  Option 5 = Less than option 4 - Hired guns Gitcoin would survive (probably), but there would not be a workstream serving the mandate. The services could be hired from FDD contributors, but  Vote for option 5 if this is your choice. Advantages  Very low cost Ability to replace autonomous workstream with service provider (No scope creep)  Disadvantages  Lose insights and knowledge gained in the last year Fall behind the red team Potential for large losses for Gitcoin community - Probably not this round, but the following because the work isn\u2019t being done to keep up with the evolving attacks Laying off people who have done good work for gitcoin   Option 4 - FDD Executes the round at bare minum Advantage  Keep FDD an autonomous unit in GitcoinDAO still working out how to best fulfill it\u2019s mandate and serve Gitcoin\u2019s mission Maintain knowledge and insights built over the last year Lean grants reviews  Disadvantage  Lose ground gained against red team Insufficient funding to continue developing new models to serve grants 2.0 (Some will be done, but not sure how much can be done with the limited time and resources) Laying off people who have done good work for gitcoin Signal opportunity to attackers (Like announcing there won\u2019t be a security guard on saturday night at a retail store)   Option 3 - Continue progress on classifying attack classes and mitigation techniques Advantage  Build on previous learning - Here is an example from new technique found in the last few weeks Develop new techniques in line with dPoPP & Project history grants 2.0 future Gain data on grants reviews to be able to scale Gitcoin rounds on grants 2.0 Understands that the human evaluations are the ethical underpinning that removes bias from our algorithms. We want the algo to \u201cthink\u201d like the community, not like the engineers that built it. Our humans in the loop process is cutting edge ethical AI and the decision to defund is to put profit ahead of purpose.  Disadvantage  Spend more (Less than any other workstream - Is Sybil Defense and Grant Eligibility less important than every other outcome the DAO works to achieve?)   Option 2 - Continue building on work to decentralize grant eligibility reviews for all future communities using grants 2.0 Advantage  In line with intended outcome of helping communities to better allocate their resources Shows an ethical difference between content moderation approaches in web 3 from web 2. Think of sybil defense as user moderation and grant eligibililty as content moderation. Did we learn anything about how not to do moderation from Twitter and Facebook? Potential reputation builder and proof-of-project history compliment Upside potential if generalized  Disadvantage  Costs $35k Could fail   Option 1 - Allow FDD to set a precedent for how to spin out efforts when the positive externalities to the ecosystem align with GitcoinDAO\u2019s mission, but exceed the mandate of the workstream. Advantage  Potentially create large upside for GitcoinDAO in ownership of the public infrastructure. Show how to build and launch public goods supporting protocols without VC funding Huge Aqueduct potential Why not build mutual grants with something we built and know works! Validation = See hop protocol sybil contest Creates a model for how to split off projects with upside when an autonomous workstream\u2019s scope creeps, but the scope creep is in line with the overall mission of GitcoinDAO, but outside of it\u2019s critical mandate.

                    "content": "Over the last couple years the anti-fraud personnel and efforts of Gitcoin grew enough that it became a dedicated unique workstream of the Gitcoin Dao.  In other words\u2026the FDD was born. The early years were full of excitement and potential, but this was not a permanent state.  Like a classic confused teenager, the FDD had to experiment with identity.  Finding/creating its identity in the rapidly-shifting environment of web3.  During all this the FDD has protected its family, even as it brainstormed roadmaps to self-sufficiency and revenue-generation.  The FDD was always mission-first.  But we must now reconsider what that mission is. Some believe the FDD scope has drifted away from the core mission.  Before approving a budget they want assurances the FDD will continue to honour Gitcoin Dao priorities.  I hear these valid concerns.  I think most folks recognize the need for balance between mission & innovation. The FDD has always been here to serve Gitcoin and this should continue. The FDD should focus on what the GitcoinDAO finds most important (every workstream should).  The FDD is finding its dao IKIGAI just like an individual.  Over the past 3-4 seasons I watched communication & coordination between workstreams improve dramatically.  This helped everyone understand the big picture.  A picture that now suggests low priorities should be paused/cancelled due to macro state. The FDD is keen to tightly align with the Gitcoin Dao.  If we came out of alignment it was completely unintentional.  I am lifted by the idea the FDD can serve the dao even better!  With the community\u2019s input the FDD can identify and trim the fat.  it is great that people care enough to speak up, and help the FDD understand and align with the Dao.  We in the FDD are eager to boost Gitcoin Dao to the next level, however that looks. There is no group better positioned to achieve greater anti-fraud results at Gitcoin. There is no group with the solid history of the FDD and the technical partnerships needed to effectively protect Gitcoin. There is no other group ready/interested to defend Gitcoin in the future.   Gitcoin can be among the leading web3 anti-sybil/anti-fraud experts.  This will happen via the FDD. Some of the un-alignment accusations came as a surprise and the FDD should have a season to respond.  If you think the scope of FDD drifted please give us the chance to demonstrate how aligned, lean and laser-focused we can be.  Help us understand the dao-wide priorities so we can help the dao.  Try to guide this crusty teenager before abandoning them.  The results will be incredible. Conclusion: My preference is for option 2.  I think the extreme reductions of option 4 are unprecedented and would sacrifice some of the significant innovations the FDD has been developing, namely a new decentralized review model (called Permissionless Reviewing) and the in-training Machine Learning system which is becoming more and more capable.  Option 3 features even larger reductions than were first requested by Kyle. Lastly, I want to recognize our unity.  It is great to see so many dedicated and loyal folks committed to the long term success of Gitcoin.  We are all on the same team here.  Go team! ",

Dare I say, for the first time in a while I can actually understand the different funding options and the outcomes FDD would deliver with each. Huge kudos to the team for mapping out options in this way. I would really love to see more Workstreams approach this in S15. I am supportive of Option 4 and on the fence on Option 3. The work to review grants, operate the rounds and offer an analysis after the round is valuable. I am still worried that some of the direction of FDD (model build out, approach to human evaluations and even the community model) may not be aligned long term with where I think FDD could be headed (this is just my opinion). So I will likely just stick to voting for option 4 for this season. ",

DisruptionJoe:  OPTION 3 - Fund FDD $369,665 (38% reduction from Season 13) FDD should perform data analysis and continue iterating on models for making round to round improvements. (Includes 7 Full Time Core Contributors) OPTION 4 - Fund FDD $222,975 (63% reduction from Season 13) FDD should only execute services for GR14 and not be evaluating opportunities for improvement or needs to keep up with the \u201cred team\u201d in future rounds. We would obviously try to keep up, but are not confident the forward looking work could be done. (Includes 5 Full Time Core Contributors)   I am wondering if there is a combination between these two? I would opt for Option 4 but I am forever wanting innovation vs stagnation so what would be a balance here where we continue iterating models (maybe it\u2019s ONE per season?) for improvement but without a 140k price tag?

Pop:  perhaps a better or more clear definition of what \" models for making round to round improvements \" may mean or entail?   Let\u2019s say you are a sybil attacker. You make a bunch of accounts Simona1, Simona2, Simona3\u2026 This is a clear signal, but we wouldn\u2019t see the usernames being closely related without  Noticing the behavior Turning the insight into a data problem - A model Creating a process for continually evaluating and updating the model  Here is the example of how we recently created another model for fighting off your attack: Fighting Simple Sybils: Levenshtein Distance - HackMD Now we know how to detect it, but we need to either manual squelch those accounts or algorithmically do it. Algorithmic scales, manual does not. To make this \u201cfeature\u201d a part of the algorithmic detection we must go a step further. We can turn the detection of the behavior into a feature for the ml model. This is the overall algorithm that combines many features to determine if an account is sybil. But what happens when the legit user \u201cSimona69\u201d gets caught in the heuristic? This is why we have humans in the loop. What is Human in the Loop Machine Learning: Why & How Used in AI? | by Vikram Singh Bisen | VSINGHBISEN | Medium The humans will notice that Simona69 is not like the 68 before it. This info will then train the algo that the high quality signal DOES have exceptions. The more humans that we have evaluate, the more opportunities for us to spot the algorithm being unfair to classes of users. The community model is finding new features and models to incorporate into what you might call a \u201cmeta-model\u201d or ensemble which is best capable of accurately identifying sybil, and more importantly - NOT SYBIL accounts. We have discussed moving the data science initiative to DAOops and maybe this is the time to do that. It helps FDD, but could be more beneficial to the DAO as a whole. The interesting part of connecting the group to FDD is that spotting sybil behavior is a lot like moving your Scrabble pieces around to see if you have a word. Sometimes we know exactly what data to request to build a feature, but spotting new behaviors is a mix of active analysis and serendipity. We could lower the overall ask to $115k for the round to round improvements and ethical guardrails to be in place by transfering the data science budget to come from DAOops. ",

Before talking at all about the current options let me re-iterate the feedback I tried to give in the google doc you had DMed me which seems to have evolved to become this proposal. What I would like to see come out of the FDD WG is an algorithmic software solution for evaluation of grants and sybil detection. With minimal human input. I do understand that human input will always be needed at some point but it should be kept at a minimum as it does not scale. For simple manual reviews of grants which is what I understand Option 4 to be I think even Option 4 is very expensive. Manual review and classification of grants is a very simple work that can be accomplished even by someone from Upwork for $10/hr so to say. Instead, and please please correct me as I may be understanding the budget wrong, what I see is: A request of $222,975 for 4.8 months (3 months + 60% reserves) for 5 full time contributors. That translates to a 222975 / 5 / 4.8 \u2192 $9290.625 per month for each employee to do \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d which is what I understand is manual reviews. This is an insane monthly salary for just manually reviewing grants.  That said what I want to see from FDD is to focus and iterate on delivering a software solution combined with minimal human input. Can you guys pull that off? So far I have not seen the most encouraging results. I see lots of hard to understand jargon and no software yet. I am at the moment not sure what to vote. I would also want to see what other stewards say. ",

Am I wrong to assume this? I thought this was a DAO or is it a CAO in which we call it a DAO, but it\u2019s just a corporation that\u2019s online 24/7 ? Is that the vision? I don\u2019t think so\u2026     lefterisjp:  Before talking at all about the current options let me re-iterate the feedback I tried to give in the google doc you had DMed me which seems to have evolved to become this proposal. What I would like to see come out of the FDD WG is an algorithmic software solution for evaluation of grants and sybil detection. With minimal human input. I do understand that human input will always be needed at some point but it should be kept at a minimum as it does not scale.   The FDD has multiple algorithmic solutions and the [Reward system] (GIA Rewards OKR Report) ( includes grant reviewers and is only  one of the solutions). The total cost of the grant reviews was exactly 14k last season and we protected millions of dollars of funds(more from an eligibility POV) . Do you think it\u2019s expensive to do manual grant ? reviews?  I don\u2019t think you actually know the issues/challenges we face as the FDD and even more so in the GIA which is in charge of grant reviewing. 14K was the cost of 12.000-15.000 reviews! The FDD does not mean grant reviewing\u2026 We could hire people from upwork but that will cost us even more\u2026We will need to train each of them\u2026takes a season or two. We actually pay our reviewers with 10-20$ per hour atm\u2026 On another note I really thought we had the ethos of decentralization here, but like reading your comments I kinda see through that \u201cmirage\u201d. Even the way in which we recruited the reviewers was fair and open for everyone. We recruited them chronologically in the order they reached out to us\u2026 and we wanted to keep things neutral and fair even within our squads. Reading your comment is like all my work within the FDD for the past three-six months was null and I can\u2019t be happy about that\u2026 Why are stewards not even looking at what we are building and just \u201chating\u201d on us? Is that fair for the contributors here? Is that fair towards me? Who worked 60+ hours a week and 80+ during the round to make sure the grant creators, our donors and our matching funds are protected?(4 real, you can look in our Discord during the round and see what\u2019s up). Associating the FDD with grant reviews nullifies all the hard work done by my peers. If you really care about Gitcoin DAO, the grants program and our community please try to understand what major issues we face \u2026we have entire organizations trying to game the system, we have hundreds of people that are creating fake grants\u2026all while running the round, ensuring sybil protection and trying to solve \u201cunsolved\u201d research problems\u2026     lefterisjp:  Instead, and please please correct me as I may be understanding the budget wrong, what I see is: A request of $222,975 for 4.8 months (3 months + 60% reserves) for 5 full time contributors.

This is an insane monthly salary for just manually reviewing grants.   Those people are not reviewing grants, I am the driver of Round Management, only my squad handles grant reviewing  and as I stated above that costs 10-20k MAX per round. This round we actually want to reduce that number with 50%, which is not fair for our contributors, but we need to reach a balance that satisfies the DAO.     lefterisjp:  I see lots of hard to understand jargon and no software yet.   That\u2019s your truth, but is it the truth?   We can have a call anytime (takes 10 minutes) and I can explain and walk you though the whole process of grant reviewing and why we opted for this system which works amazingly btw  I\u2019m sure that @DisruptionJoe @omnianalytics @Sirlupinwatson @David_Dyor and @vogue20033 can explain more about our collective efforts. PS. I know and I completely agree what the DAO has some BIG issue. Parasitic behaviors are the threat to any organisation\u2026 The FDD is not the biggest spender and we work on one of the most complicated and complex set of problems. I don\u2019t believe that by cutting our budget we will do the DAO a favor  If people vote for Option 3 which is less than 400k they will see that we could and probably will continue to save funds(from our donors and matching funds) that are more than that number.

We will figure out the Passport (dPoPP) usage patterns of known sybil accounts to identify features to use in creating the Gitcoin Passport Reader score which would be exported to dapps that don\u2019t want to roll their own algo. Unfortunately, we only have a couple seasons to do this while the Passport is being used on cGrants before the grant registry and round manager parts of the protocol are rolled out. The idea being we can move from private repos using some PII data to open repos using only publicly available on chain data. We know that the community values decentralization, privacy, consent, etc. We have had the same outcomes all along and have adjusted with the new plans for grants 2.0. At this point, the community has been cheering us on as we built the proper tools for the job, but they aren\u2019t all finished. We thought the timeline was to be able to launch by the time grants 2.0 launches. Now, if we are \u201cdefunded\u201d it is a catch-22. People can say, \u201csee they didn\u2019t build anything with the money\u201d, but in reality we did a lot of research and iteration to understand the problem space and have started on building in the solution space. All along we were executing the necessary minimum to keep the rounds going. The reason I shared the documents around Trust Builders and the info about the community model and SDD above is because the evidence is tangible. If we stop now, Gitcoin community will provide a grants 2.0 protocol with all its eggs in one basket on an untested sybil defense hypothesis and throw away its investment in other solutions that work today, against the advice of those directly working on the problem, even though those people are agreeing that it is a great hypothesis that we should test! Please discuss with the data scientists and people working on the problem before making a decision. It would also leave a 3/4 built skyscraper behind where people could say, \u201csee, GitcoinDAO couldn\u2019t provide a protocol without single points of failure and they wasted all their money on this thing\u201d\u2026 but it might just be that finishing building that skyscraper would have removed the single points of failure.

Arnold, \u201cMathematics is the part of physics were experiments are cheap.\u201d This is one of those places where the is really about how to define the cost function that we\u2019re trying to optimize. It\u2019s important to think very carefully about all of the tradeoffs  \u2013 not only about the budget for today, but also about the long-term values and risks in play. I\u2019ve seen it proposed that the task of investigating sybils be crowdsourced to  $10/hour workers on Upwork. This simply moves the challenges FDD is trying to address to other areas: 1. how do you vet the workers on Upwork beforehand? 2. how do you know that the work done by the Upworkers is valid? I am afraid this approaches severely underestimates the resources and motivations of Red Team; what keeps Red Team from flooding Upwork with applicants that they know will approve their sybils? Or bribing existing workers with $1000 to approve a selected Sybil (given that some bad actors have $100k+ budgets for their grants, targeting a $1k bribe doesn\u2019t seem out of proportion)? The steps that would be needed to take to make crowdsourced work viable are exactly the steps that FDD is currently exploring, with the added incentive that FDD will gain knowledge and retain control of the process. We always have to think very carefully about what we are optimizing, about the risks and tradeoffs. It is always going to be cheaper in the short run to work with established structures , cut costs, and ignore future growth. Spending time experimenting and exploring uncertain realms, by definition, will always have unknown ROI. But maintaining the growth @owocki has proposed that GitCoin is an egregore, which means it is a living thing, which means that it needs to be fed and nurtured. I think the egregore that GitCoin needs to become operates differently than a traditional bottom-line business, and this is something that people who are responsible for feeding the egregore (i.e. the stewards) need to consider. The current FDD proposals are seeking to balance the two objectives of present performance and learning for the future  by 1. performing within established knowledge while simultaneously using simulations (as cheap experiments) to gather information about alternative models. The simulations and other models are important, because we are dealing here with a human intelligence network with an intriguing type of information flow. We need models because networks of human intelligence and information flow aren\u2019t amenable to purely logical testing like software programs. ",

We have done the work, had tough conversations and continue to perform even after losing three people in the budget review process. As a last request for stewards, I\u2019d like to request that you to consider the following.   All options are more than a 40% deduction from the original request which is more than any steward asked for.   In a grants 2.0 future, we need to consider that FDD is responsible for protecting the legitimacy and credible neutrality of our own Gitcoin community rounds.    As other communities have rounds, they will need to choose their funding stack as well. With that, they will either take recommendations from what we use, roll their own algo, or design new solutions. We can be invested in the generalized FDD solutions as businesses and protocols.   Our work is on a core functions in Gitcoin Grants.  Finally, here is one more way to look at what FDD does based on functions in the funding stack. ",

I read your entire proposal the first time, and I did it again. I will vote for Option 2 in the Snapshot.  OPTION 2 - Fund FDD $330,000 and signal they should not perform a discovery 4 of a sybil detection / Passport DAO (49% reduction from original request)  I believe:  innovation is important to any organisation, encouraging it is key prudence is just as important, and I appreciate FDD trying to move towards being a leader in sybil defence  With the changes to Grant 2.0, FDD will need to evolve with it. I think creating some space for that is important while continually executing on FDD\u2019s core functions. However, I\u2019d like to remind some contributors that Stewards are not your enemy. Therefore I\u2019d like to give some appreciation to @David_Dyor for his carefully written explanation to give context on how we might make better decisions regarding FDD.  Analysis Comparing both proposals ,here\u2019s the key changes I think happened Core functions FDD OS from 124.4k to 95k (-29.4k)  removed storytellers (-14.4k) halved data analysis (-15k)  Grants eligibility from 86.5k to 60k (-26.5k)  halved ethelo dev (-6.5k) lowered cost for round, reward, GIA which budgeted 60k by 1/3 (-20k)  Data Ops from 50k to 45k (-5k)  simply lowered it by 10%  Adding in the Innovation segment Passport Trustseekers == Sybil Detection DAO from 60k to 60k (-0k)  both have same budget @60k   Community Intelligence, probably combination of catalyst and community model from 97.5k to 70k (- 27.5k)  guess is catalyst from 37.5k to 30k (-7.5k) because we love schelling points community model from 60k to 40k (-20k), also a 1/3 reduction  My guess is that the \u201cExpansion\u201d is more of a psychological element to nudge stewards to vote for Option 2. which is innovation because its description is so sparse. A bit like fire sales saying original price is $10, 50% discount at $5.  Conclusion I think FDD has somehow managed to balance most of the original roadmap, cut out some additional items that we\u2019ve given feedback on (thank you for taking in some of mine too!). Here\u2019s a potential compromise for S15. I would suggest considering splitting items up and @DisruptionJoe being an advisor to these workstreams Core to FDD  Grants Investigation Workstream Sybil Detection Workstream  DAO innovation  Gitcoin Research Workstream - I noticed that research work is being done throughout the DAO including MMM\u2019s research on grants with a case study Passport Workstream - however this should fall under Moonshot/Product team  Yes it will give stewards more to look at. However, consider @kyle 's hypothesis that Thin workstreams might lead to better outcomes.  From this perspective, I think splitting innovation from the core function of FDD can help us get our key sybil detection and grants approval process going while we are given more time to discuss and evaluate the direction of innovation we want to go as a DAO, and as FDD.

                    "content": "So for me this one is a very hard decision. I am leaning towards  voting for option 3. The reasons are that:  I believe FDD, or something like that essential to Gitcoin grants and as such should definitely be something we should have during the grants round. I am sure that sybil Detection DAO is not something the DAO should spend funds right now under the current market. I am not confident that the current FDD team is able to deliver on what the DAO needs in the long run. I am not sure if it\u2019s the fault of the team organization, the roadmap they are trying to stick to, or a breakdown of communication between FDD and the rest of the DAO. Something is off.  For Option 2 we are asked to fund \u201cPassport Truthseekers\u201d and \u201cCommunity Intelligence\u201d. I read the bullet points and explanations of what each of those is. I can\u2019t really judge if it\u2019s useful or not. I don\u2019t have anything to judge by. No results to compare with. On the other hand I understand that this is what innovation and research is about, but how long can we keep funding research without concrete results? Then again I see comments by @David_Dyor and @DisruptionJoe here in this thread where they say they are surprised about the misalignment between the DAO and the FDD.  Some of the un-alignment accusations came as a surprise and the FDD should have a season to respond. If you think the scope of FDD drifted please give us the chance to demonstrate how aligned, lean and laser-focused we can be. Help us understand the dao-wide priorities so we can help the dao. Try to guide this crusty teenager before abandoning them. The results will be incredible.  and asking for more time to act on the feedback  It would also leave a 3/4 built skyscraper behind where people could say, \u201csee, GitcoinDAO couldn\u2019t provide a protocol without single points of failure and they wasted all their money on this thing\u201d\u2026 but it might just be that finishing building that skyscraper would have removed the single points of failure. (skyscraper = the sybil work done so far)  Which makes me want to help towards aligning more on the goals and giving more feedback. I am really torn, between option 3 and 2, but leaning towards 3. Even if If I vote for 2, it would still not be a vote for the current way FDD is doing things. We need to reconsider a lot of things. Most important of which are:  Conciseness. FDD has a tendency to go off on a tangent. Every time I look at what you guys are doing, it sounds and looks more and more complicated than the previous time. You also tend to have funny names and very long form descriptions of everything. Keep it simple. (similar to point 1.). Please keep things simple. Stewards are not your enemies, but if we can\u2019t understand what you are doing, or if we have to spend hours to understand something that should have been straightforward (come on guys it\u2019s not rocket science) we won\u2019t blindly say yes to it. Alignment on goals. Do one thing and do it well. It seems that FDD is trying to do too many things at the same time. We should have discussion within the DAO about what the FDD\u2019s mandate and goal is again. Communication. There seems to be a breakdown of communication between you guys and the DAO. This is evident by the surprise you show in the feedback while this was already known between stewards in previous rounds too. Also by the comments in this thread about lack of inclusion in grants 2.0 planning (quoted below).   I would really love very direct feedback from @lthrift (Product Director) @kevin.olsen (VP of eng) @brent (Passport PM) and @nategosselin (Grants PM) to see which specific points are not aligned here. Let\u2019s have a productive conversation! I am also asking for us to be involved in co-creating a future. I don\u2019t understand why FDD was only involved in the grants 2.0 planning in discovery workshops where the product team for grants 2.0 learned what FDD was currently doing, but not in any future planning where we could have put these ideas forward and course corrected together at an earlier point in this process.  No matter what option is voted for these 4 points need to be addressed. Since the snapshot vote runs until tomorrow evening and it\u2019s already late here, I will sleep on it and vote tomorrow. But wanted to leave my thoughts here first. ",

                    "content": "Tl;dr - I will be voting to fund option 2. Grant review/approval (eligibility enforcement, etc.) and the data science work from FDD has been incredibly important for us to continue and encourage the growth of the Grants program. I want to continue my thanks and appreciation to the FDD team for the ongoing conversation and revisions of this budget. I have appreciated those conversations and the willingness to explore an alternative to the previously proposed focus areas. As we evaluate the future of Grants and our Identity management tooling (Gitcoin Passport), I am of the opinion that much of the FDD work as previously scoped (before these revisions) have been focused on solving our sybil detection and sybil suppression in the wrong way. This budget proposal and my vote for Option 2 comes with the expectation that we will continue to realign FDD towards partnership in a protocol driven approach (as opposed to an ML based, and human review approach). A protocol based Sybil prevention approach will make the rounds (for all Grants 2.0 communities) more expensive to attack than they are to defend. Today, our Sybil detection is a very expensive red team vs blue team where we are constantly \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d finding and updating our approach. In the future, defining a cost of forgery for a wallet, which defines eligible matching pool impact will be possible with the protocol. This means, we will let the existing Sybil detection processes fade and shift from how we do things today. I am interested in funding Option 2 to ensure GR14 still runs (grant eligibility reviewed, sybil detection and \u201cfraud tax\u201d calculated, appeals process on eligibility, etc.). I am also interested in seeing continued data science from Omni as it has been very instructive in helping us shape the future approach. When evaluating past versions of the budget (and option 1), I don\u2019t believe funding other mechanisms should continue and FDD has heard this critique and cut their budget request by ~45% from S13 to accommodate this cut in investment. One item that I want to flag is that I believe there is an opportunity to better align on how to direct $60k of this budget in closer partnership with the Grants 2.0 and MSC workstreams. My vote for Option 2 comes with the request that the roadmap for the Truth Seeker\u2019s work is roadmapped and agreed upon with the Grants 2.0 workstream and MSC. They are directing the work for those protocols and I would want to ensure they are aligned with the work to expand our thinking there. ",

                    "content": "    octopus:  I\u2019ve seen it proposed that the task of investigating sybils be crowdsourced to $10/hour workers on Upwork. This simply moves the challenges FDD is trying to address to other areas: 1. how do you vet the workers on Upwork beforehand? 2. how do you know that the work done by the Upworkers is valid? I am afraid this approaches severely underestimates the resources and motivations of Red Team; what keeps Red Team from flooding Upwork with applicants that they know will approve their sybils? Or bribing existing workers with $1000 to approve a selected Sybil (given that some bad actors have $100k+ budgets for their grants, targeting a $1k bribe doesn\u2019t seem out of proportion)?   How do you vet any new hire? How do you know the work done by any new hire is valid? The people working for the FDD can be bribed even easier than new people off upwork, as many of them have public twitter accounts, finding out who you hire on upwork would be much harder. I have found INCREDIBLE people off upwork for Giveth and Commons Stack. In fact, at this point about 1/2 the Commons Stack team was hired off of upwork. None of them would take bribes. We have to hire off upwork, because we don\u2019t have VC funding, we live month to month on donations, but yet we still scramble to make it happen, and make an impact. In fact, we make a greater impact because we are sending crypto to countries that need it. If you would like help hiring off of upwork, some of the Ops money that was raised can be sent to General Magic, who does our hiring, and they can help find great candidates\u2026 and even show them how we do it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we need to also have experts like yourself Octopus (you know i love your work) and Z (you KNOW I love his and Blockscience\u2019s work) but where we can, lets stop hiring people from the US and Switzerland, and hire people that can do the same (or often better) work for 1/3 the cost. The FDD has to cut costs, GTC cannot handle the wild inflation that was voted for this quarter, I can\u2019t believe how much was approved to be spent on Ops and MMM\u2026 its ridiculous. IMO more should be spent in FDD than Ops and MMM this quarter\u2026 both can have admins from lower income places support their work. But that ship has sailed, we are where we are and we need to appreciate the market forces and the fact that GTC has no sources to generate demand right now or on the horizon, and tighten up. :-/ But I believe in the FDD team and the expertise they have developed, and am excited to see what they can build this quarter! I am voting for Option 2. ",

Consequently, (round over round) RoR Health Metrics are deployed to determine progress toward the medium term (12-18 months) goals. Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) are used to guide each top level goal set within a season. Outcomes are derived from our retro & strategy workshops, discussed with CSDO leadership, then assigned to an Outcome Owner through a process of nomination, synthesis, and ratification. Outcome owners are allowed to participate on the FDD Source Council. This gives them voice through the progressively decentralized FDD decision-making process. The corresponding Decision Making Agreement can be found in Notion. Most importantly, Outcome Owners are accountable for successfully executing on deliverables during a season and transparently communicating blockers and impediments preventing or delaying the delivery of key results. The FDD Source Council is responsible for incubating ideas and implementing passed proposals in the interest of the continuous improvement and progressive decentralization of FDD & Gitcoin.  Essential Intent & RoR Health Metrics These metrics are how we show the round over round improvements of the FDD workstream.

I\u2019m lucky to work with him, with my collegues in the FDD and also with the GItcoin DAO peeps I with to invite anyone interested in voting on our budget to study the FDD\u2019s evolution from GR11 to GR12 to GR13 and now to GR14. It sound be eazy to follow up by reading our governance briefs from the respective seasons. The cohesion of this workstream is amazing and quality, values and proactiveness of it\u2019s members are something rare, even in web3. Evolving while also maintaining and improving the FDD\u2019s initial functions is not an easy task and should be taken into account when voting on this budget request. As a SC member and driver of 2 squads in the Grant Investigation Agency I believe it\u2019s crucial we continue to get funded. We have been responsible with overviewing and executing on one of the most complex and important matters for the Gitcoin: the Gitcoin Grants! Congratulations for all the FDDers, you are great! ",

Here\u2019s the approach I took to make sense of the FDD budget that I took (after looking at everything) and the subsequent comments/suggestions I\u2019ll give. 1. Get a sense of the top level sums This can be found under Season 14 Budget Requirements and splits the budget into outcome owners, GIA, Sybil Defenders, and Evolution 2. Start with the FDD Season 14 Goal Planning documents 3. See if you agree with the overall goals Here are my thoughts for the team:   What about prevention of sybils?: I\u2019m curious if FDD is looking at prevention/deterrence rather than detection. having less sybils might make it easier to defend too. A red team approach might help where some FDD individuals are empowered to pose as sybils to try to attack us and learn from that rather than relying too much on automation and AI/ML.  FDD Storytellers might not be necessary: this stood out as its more of a PR activity for FDD. For context, its asking for 14.4k USD which is >50% of most of your sub-workstreams. Its unclear how it will help improve contributor UX, GIA execution, or sybil execution and the items of quests etc seem to fall under onboarding instead. I\u2019ll suggest removing it or making it into just a sample blog post or explainer for contributors.  Greater focus on policy: working with grantees for GR13, there was some feedback that the policy was unclear or that the process for grantees might feel arbitrary or disheartening. I know this isn\u2019t the case but perhaps reallocating the budget from storytelling to policy communications will be more helpful. In fact, including that as a top-level OKR for GIA might be even better. Right now Evolution has a higher % of budget compared to GIA too which might suggest overindexing on automating and growing FDD for this particular budget  Inter-Workstream work: would like to see some evidence of discussion on FDD with Grants 2.0 especially with \u201cCatalyst | nollied\u201d which is asking for 37.5k USD (one of the largest allocations). Caveat that I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t discussion, but would like some idea of how aligned this work is especially because what is proposed is very experimental and is researching a lot of different highly technical topics.  Sybil Detection DAO needs more details: I know there\u2019s some context as during ETHDenver this idea was floated. Right now I\u2019m assuming its about creating a sub-DAO focused on sybil detection, but I thought that was FDD itself. Also it\u2019s asking for 90k USD which is the largest % of the overall budget.  Overall thoughts: I like that FDD takes time to explore more experimental issues and DAO-wide issues. The budget and its process to come up with it is democratic and decentralised which I appreciate too, however I\u2019d like to see work done between other parts of the DAO (links to discussions, WIP, etc) to get a better idea how the work is going.  4. Take a look at past performance with the S13 Report Card  at first glance, most of everything has been done, so congratulations to the workstream for pulling of a great season! interesting to see the work exploiting grants and a focus on simulations, I suppose that falls under prevention! curious how some of these things have been used like the mandate delivery option and the CAP table research  5. Requests and rationale for vote choice   Requests: Additional focus on Grant Policy communication, removing FDD Storytelling, include more inter-WS discussions to provide more confidence on decisions and direction. I\u2019d like to see more work from subject matter experts on the technical aspects of FDD, especially on mechanism design and AI/ML work  Rationale: I am leaning towards a FOR vote as I agree with most of the OKRs and won\u2019t want to let one OKR hold back my general positivity towards FDD.  Once again a great job putting together elements of the budget! ",

We also made this budget review tool on Ethelo and would love for you all to check it out to review all of the Season 14 budget requests! https://gitcoinbudget.ethelo.net/     Fishbiscuit:  What about prevention of sybils? : I\u2019m curious if FDD is looking at prevention/deterrence rather than detection. having less sybils might make it easier to defend too. A red team approach might help where some FDD individuals are empowered to pose as sybils to try to attack us and learn from that rather than relying too much on automation and AI/ML.   Yes. This is directly a goal of ours with the Catalyst squad (formerly called Matrix).     Fishbiscuit:  DD Storytellers might not be necessary : this stood out as its more of a PR activity for FDD. For context, its asking for 14.4k USD which is >50% of most of your sub-workstreams. Its unclear how it will help improve contributor UX, GIA execution, or sybil execution and the items of quests etc seem to fall under onboarding instead. I\u2019ll suggest removing it or making it into just a sample blog post or explainer for contributors.   We actually found that this one bubbled up for us from all the contributors. We weren\u2019t doing a good job of sharing context within the workstream between squads. Most of your other criticisms here seem to highlight the need for some level of comms. This is a very small budget and the outcome owner is already a source council member with another outcome so there isn\u2019t a full time person dedicated to this. We simply felt the need to be intentional about this.     Fishbiscuit:  Greater focus on policy : working with grantees for GR13, there was some feedback that the policy was unclear or that the process for grantees might feel arbitrary or disheartening. I know this isn\u2019t the case but perhaps reallocating the budget from storytelling to policy communications will be more helpful. In fact, including that as a top-level OKR for GIA might be even better. Right now Evolution has a higher % of budget compared to GIA too which might suggest overindexing on automating and growing FDD for this particular budget   One answer to this is that we raised the round management budget substantially and put the grant policy work within this stream. We believe that the policy errors were more process driven than due to an unclear policy (although its just a weighting, not a binary). Another answer is that we are bearish on policy in general. Instead, we are solving for how any community, including our own, can collectively set and review criteria and grants eligibility status against that criteria in a decentralized way that maximizes for trusted outcomes first, then minimizes cost for scalability. You can see this in our Rewards Modeling OKR report here or if you want a high level overview, watch this 8 minute video.     Fishbiscuit:  Inter-Workstream work : would like to see some evidence of discussion on FDD with Grants 2.0 especially with \u201cCatalyst | nollied\u201d which is asking for 37.5k USD (one of the largest allocations). Caveat that I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t discussion, but would like some idea of how aligned this work is especially because what is proposed is very experimental and is researching a lot of different highly technical topics.   This workstream was formerly called Matrix. We believe that it\u2019s work is crucial because without it we are not preparing for a grants 2.0 future. Funds removed from fraudulent allocation is the most relevant metric for them. Without them we do not have a high-level overview of why we are focusing where we are. In the last season, Kylin\u2019s review on the matching caps informed the grants ops decision on what to do with matching caps. Additionally, they identified an entirely new vector of attack. Their work is needed in my opinion and their budget is only lower than the sybil model now because innovation and research is a hard sell, but unfortunately FDD is tasked with solving 2 unsolved research problems for Gitcoin. In season 14, they are tasked with coming up with Grants 2.0 components which can minimize fraudulent allocation. They will map the composable components and communicate an understanding of the tradeoffs in different component stacks. They will also be able to inform decisions based on simulations. Grants 2.0 is going to be a main customer for this squad because they will need a collection of components to start. They are currently focused on building the first component of Grants 2.0 as the ones which are used in cgrants, but this squad can simulate and suggest new legos with code that can be dropped into production. They can also plugin synthetic data to the community model to help train it faster. Another way they can reduce costs is in prototyping NLP solutions. Lastly, they can help other FDD squads with simulations. Deliverables include reports and graphics and even code for grants 2.0 components.     Fishbiscuit:  Sybil Detection DAO needs more details : I know there\u2019s some context as during ETHDenver this idea was floated. Right now I\u2019m assuming its about creating a sub-DAO focused on sybil detection, but I thought that was FDD itself. Also it\u2019s asking for 90k USD which is the largest % of the overall budget.   I will be directly leading this effort. The details are in flux, but we need to begin building some of our standards into protocols which will serve as microservice protocol DAOs. The entire solution can be generalized to serve all of web 3. Here is the Sybil Detection DAO deck. Overall, thank you for the thoughtful response. ",

I do intend to update my voter guide as we discuss here, but hopefully we can keep the FDD relevant convo in this thread. tl;dr on my current sentiment:  FDD - Requesting a reduction (from 118K to 67K GTC), FDD is a cost center, like DAO Ops and should be focused on maintaining as slim of an operating budget as possible. Gitcoin seems to be paying for the education and advancement of a number of ideas - Sybil DAO, Most of \u201cEvolution\u201d, Catalyst, etc. without any discernible increase in value being delivered back to the DAO. Cutting most of \u201cEvolution\u201d, scaling back \u201cSybil defenders\u201d and doing a deeper dive on the value of GIA would be valuable. FDD has brought tremendous strength in ideas to the Gitcoin DAO, and those participating in the workstream are sharp and care deeply about our mission. FDD seems to be building for themselves and not for Gitcoin - costs continue to grow without a large change in result (though I understand decentralized approaches are culprits for this cost increase). FDD supports a two week long blitz (Grants Round) which has a leading and trailing week or so of intense evaluation of the round. Getting to a budget of $650k to support the Round is just too much. IMO, Outcome owners can lead much of \u201cEvolution\u201d as part of their day to day if they weren\u2019t just building the machine to feed the machine.  We seem to have hit a tipping point where despite the volume needing to be processed, we still continue to see growth (though much less growth than past seasons). I am still struck by how much we could accomplish with a team of three (Joe, Kevin and I) and the partnership with Blockscience. It cost us roughly $50K/mo to deliver all of our sybil detection for rounds up to 11. And now we are at a 13x funding request ($550K) with a 1.5x increase in Grants funding volume (the 1.5x number may be too low as it likely depends how you measure the round volume - I am looking at $$ going through the platform contributors - which for the longest time had been our north star ). I don\u2019t want to see FDD go away, I just really wish there was more prudence in the selection of ways they are expanding. The bear market we are heading into has really changed my risk tolerance for the experimentation and learning. I feel it is important all workstreams deeply evaluate the impact they have for Gitcoin and strip down to the slimmest budget they can while maintaining the impact likely for S14, S15. Even if it means slowing initiatives like Sybil DAO, new tooling build outs, research on adjacent areas (like DAO governance models), etc. I would love some thoughts from the FDD team on how might we be able to cut this budget down to perhaps a 7x increase from \u201cthe good ole days\u201d as compared to where we are now. This request and feedback is going out to all workstreams. ",

Your understanding of FDD\u2019s role in solving unsolved research problems which existentially affect Gitcoin\u2019s future is interesting to me. You seem to be saying on one side that we, Gitcoin, need to focus on creating a decentralized protocol. That there is no future value for Gitcoin if we don\u2019t decentralize the system and give the governance token more utility in that process. FDD is doing that with both of our areas of responsibility, but your answer is \u2018You, me, Kevin and Blockscience could do it for less\u2019. From the beginning, the reason for having a workstream for FDD was to push the control of the subjective decisions out of the hands of a few\u2026 you me kevin We take that seriously and are building to allow larger numbers of participants.     kyle:   Sybil DAO, Most of \u201cEvolution\u201d, Catalyst, etc. without any discernible increase in value being delivered back to the DAO    Sybil Detection DAO - On one hand you are saying we need to find ways to provide upside back to the DAO. On the other hand, you see a (lightly) validated idea that simply needs execution to take a solution we are using which can be generalized for all of web 3 and think this is simply education. The wild thing is that while we would provide the digital infrastructure which would be required for online democracies to work, we would also benefit from better data into our system. Very positive sum. Cutting most of evolution - Which part of evolution do you think is least needed?  Contributors knowing when and how to participate? Us understanding where are strengths and weaknesses are and continually improving? Our data collection and aggregation that allows us to be data driven? Our internal and external communication of what we are doing so we are clear between ourselves and you and other stewards understand our work? (This one is new, but the explanation to fishbiscuit above discusses relevant details) Our paying contributors on time? Our paying contributors for the roles DAOops has requested we create?  If we had wanted DAO ops to run everything and control all the decision making, hiring, and payment decisions along with assessing every workstream\u2019s competency, then we probably should have made a company, not a DAO. That is a little facetious. I do want to hand over responsibility for some of these items as we have done with others in the past, but I don\u2019t believe the DAOops workstream has advanced to the level to be able to fully serve our needs. Reasons:  After 6 months we still don\u2019t have a metric for \u201cwhat is a successful onboard to gitcoinDAO?\u201d Our peer review process supplied to us was basically telling us to walk all our contributors through copying a google form with the right settings and sending it out. This handed us more work that we needed to pay our contributors to do rather than providing a service. We didn\u2019t include the $120k for travel expenses the CSDO passed! ($120k coming from the Moonshot proposal)  They will get there, and the way we will do that is by other workstreams, FDD included, developing their own systems. We allow the successful norms to emerge and then DAOops can facilitate the operations which we all opt in to sharing. What you don\u2019t explicitly say here is that by eliminating FDDs operations and structure, you are effectively asking for all hiring, decision making, and information gathering and insights to be provided by DAOops.     kyle:  doing a deeper dive on the value of GIA would be valuable   Can you say more here?     kyle:  FDD seems to be building for themselves and not for Gitcoi   This is ridiculous! Quadratic funding (and most other funding mechanisms one might use in grants 2.0) does not work without sybil resistance. Second, if you want a decentralized protocol that improves democracy and allows for better allocation of resources you HAVE TO provide a decentralized way to source the inputs to the system. Sybil detection is not the only way to do this. Catalyst is working on mechanism design solutions for grants 2.0. Either way, if the content moderation (both users/sybil and issues/grants) for online democracies works like what you had at Twitter, then we are not building for this community. This work from our rewards modeling crew in GIA went fairly unnoticed, but it is essentially the point of what FDD needs to do. We need to understand how we can create trusted outcomes via engineering good systems, then minimize the cost to be efficient, but not so efficient that the system centralizes. This will be used to optimize and decentralize the inputs to the sybil pipeline along with it\u2019s original intention of optimizing the grant review mechanism so that ANY community can provide community curation rather than self curation. We are going to be able to offer legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability AT SCALE if we are successful. If that isn\u2019t directly in benefit of Gitcoin, I don\u2019t know what is.     kyle:  Even if it means slowing initiatives like Sybil DAO, new tooling build outs, research on adjacent areas (like DAO governance models), et   You obviously see this as an expense and I see it as an investment that also happens to make us better. Gitcoin would own a substantial share of these protocols to govern and participate in their growth. Think aqueducts and ownership. (Kinda like owning a rental property. You benefit from the investment appreciation and cashflow.) By understanding the governance for a new Sybil Detection DAO, we can help Gitcoin launch multiple subDAO microservice protocols which will be legitimate public goods as digital infrastructure enabling online democracies. By building out Sybil Detection DAO, we gain data partners which need to be rewarded for providing us with data that makes our detection efforts better. By building out new tools like Ethelo for grant reviews, we enable the community to make eligibility decisions. We provide a way for the subjectivity inherent in decisions to be owned and distributed in the community, not a delegated authority.     kyle:  I would love some thoughts from the FDD team on how might we be able to cut this budget down to perhaps a 7x increase from \u201cthe good ole days\u201d as compared to where we are now.   Those weren\u2019t the \u201cgood ole days\u201d. Those days sucked. I do not want to \u201cMake Gitcoin Great Again\u201d! We were unable to innovate or really even understand what was happening. We were not able to assess if the things we worked on were the most relevant. This type of thinking is what led us to the previous dGrants issues. It led us to not decoupling the eth and platform creating a ton of confusion and unhappy users (who think FDD is messing up but not realizing we made design decisions that made it impossible to be logically consistent) The suggestion that FDD is here for itself and not the community is simply untrue. We are innovating to find solutions. Perhaps if you didn\u2019t ask us to \u201cslim down\u201d and not look at the overall threats to the DAO, we would have rang a louder alarm about the need for treasury management back when we started in November. If we were to line up the importance of our work, it would probably fall under PGF and the yet to come GPC, but right up there with them. Heck, I remember the good ole days where I was hired for growth but we couldn\u2019t get the data needed to make that work and had a major gap in operations which I ended up filling. Back then we didn\u2019t need ANY marketing. (I\u2019m absolutely not saying we don\u2019t need MMM, I\u2019m just pointing out the double standard in the logic.) ",

I feel we are both entitled to hold our opinions and I want to call out that I understand your position and I think I understand the value you see in the work you and the FDD are doing. In the market we are bracing for and with the results I have seen, I am advocating now is not the time to  make such large investments.     DisruptionJoe:  We are innovating to find solutions.   One area I have hoped for FDD to innovate is in software that integrates with the platform / protocol. And my understanding is that the investments have instead been made in building (adjacent) software that support manual review and manual intervention. The ASOP is likely the place that our visions had aligned the most, and I know you were slowed/blocked by a contributor\u2019s lack of action there so i do want to acknowledge the work there.  I am really trying to think through how we move forward. Perhaps I can articulate some of my thoughts more 1:1 and then you can evaluate if they are viable? A larger change is likely needed and I dont want you to feel rugged or pushed out as part of that retooling. We have a protocol coming (dPopp) which will make much of what FDD does more scalable, and also invite others to participate in a simple and effective way in determining the best sybil suppression model. If S14 is a \u201ctide us over\u201d type of season and we cut the things we know we are not going to need in the same way for S15, I could get behind that budget. ",

Coming back to Words creates worlds! I d like to highlight these three:     kyle:  FDD is a cost center       kyle:  FDD seems to be building for themselves and not for Gitcoin       kyle:  IMO, Outcome owners can lead much of \u201cEvolution\u201d as part of their day to day if they weren\u2019t just building the machine to feed the machine.   What\u2019s awesome about calling another organizational entity a cost center? What\u2019s awesome about making the assumption that FDD seems to be building for themselves?  In a decentralized environment shared understanding of the broader (business) context and priorities, a culture of embracing positive conflict and a felt sense of purpose can better be cultivated and balanced through an approach of having intelligent conversations.  Just compare these two approaches: A World  with conversations like these: This conversation is initiated from an inner felt sense of fear. The urgency to act now and protection against some externality that one can\u2019t control seem to guide the interaction between people. One adopts a defensive or offensive position. The other one reacts in an offensive or defensive way. Roles may switch back and forth. A victimized state gets acted out. Both eventually find themselves defending their position and trying to execute power over the other in order to survive. A World  with Conversations like these: This conversation is initiated from a state of trust and presence. One would approach the situation from an inner felt sense of wholeness, being okay with oneself and courage. A genuine curiosity would be rising and one is wondering how we - together - could master this situation of turmoil and uncertainty. What is emerging here and what questions for which I do not have answers yet can I ask? How can I serve the people to thrive sustainably in the long run? How can I have power with them and partner with them? Which world would you intentionally want to manifest? Which quality of conversations regarding budget do you want to lead? I sincerely believe we do have a conscious choice here. And no, I am not telling anybody that it is easy, but I believe it\u2019s going to be worth it to aspire for World  Conversations. -Tigress ",

I am actually not biased in any way(even if I am leading two GIA initiatives, I actually asked for the minim minimorum that we need to get things running and ensuring that the credible neutrality of the grants is ensured)  because I assumed that passing the budget this time will be even more difficult due to the market conditions. I\u2019m kinda a newcomer here, only around for 10 months, but not new in web3 and life . Life has thought me that yes, unpleasant things happen, sometimes they are out of your control => so reducing out budget would not be the end of the world and certainly not the end of the FDD. My life experience AND geographical location(next to Ukraine, God bless everyone ) has also thought me that I should prepare for the worst. My question is: How come that Gitcoin as the amazing organisation(not ironic, I love it) that it is, didn\u2019t prepare for bear market conditions? As a contributor I find this a little distressing\u2026 This could be seen as a big vulnerability and while I\u2019m sure that everyone here actually cares about our goal and wants to make the world a better place via public goods funding, I do find it a little weird that we as the cyber organism that we are, didn\u2019t prepare for the bears  Maybe we should learn from this and prepare for the future. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t increase spending or funding initiatives just based on the optimistic sentiment that we all have when the bulls are in charge in the markets   ",

The goals of the treasury diversification are to de-risk Gitcoin\u2019s treasury, make sure the treasury has sufficient stablecoins to cover one year of operating expenses, and ensure that GTC tokens are held by long-term partners. This post outlines the need and pr\u2026         2022 Roadmap & 2022 Goals \ud83e\udd16 Meta-Governance       Here are some proposed 2022 goals from the Gitcoin Holdings side of things.

Objective 2: More Decentralization:   2 implementations of ($1k GMV each) dGrants forks (horizontal scale) Release a generally available V1 of a shared grants \u2026     I think a better way to rephrase your question is \u201cWhy didnt WE prepare for bear market conditions?\u201d ",

On one hand, FDD does important work that is critical to our mission. On the other hand, I share the concerns raised by others around FDD\u2019s rising costs. I agree with the assessment that FDD is a cost center - if we didn\u2019t have the problem of sybil attacks, we wouldn\u2019t spend money on fraud detection; it is not GMV-generative. This view is reinforced by FDD\u2019s own stated workstream mandate - \u201cdefend Gitcoin from threats\u201d; it\u2019s here to protect downside, rather than to generate upside. And that\u2019s just fine. Being a cost center is by no means a bad thing, and doesn\u2019t make the work FDD does any less important - calling something a \u2018cost center\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be viewed as an attack or as a diminishing sentiment. Without the work FDD does, we would not have a viable grants program. Sybil resistance is work to be extremely proud of. That said, I do worry about FDD\u2019s rising costs, and frankly, the budget request and supporting documents are extremely cumbersome to review - after going through them all, I still don\u2019t feel confident in having a clear assessment of this workstream and what, at a macro level, FDD is building towards. I feel like I need someone to summarize it all for me - and that shouldn\u2019t be the case, given how closely I work with FDD. I believe others have shared similar feedback, and so I will wait to see what the resolution is before making a decision on voting. ",

When we find solutions for unsolved problems with a large TAM, should we generalize the solution and have Gitcoin invest in it, or even own it outright? Should we only allow certain workstreams to do this?

I do not view it as an \u201cattack\u201d. It is an invalid statement in my opinion.     annika:  Without the work FDD does, we would not have a viable grants program.   Yes. Then please explain why every other workstream should have higher budgets if this is true? Honestly not trying to be snarky here, I\u2019d really like to know how we consider every other workstream\u2019s work to be more important than dealing with this existential risk. (Considering @kyle is asking for a 40% reduction) Especially when you consider it is an unsolved research problem with a red-team blue team aspect continually changing the strategy and it is core to the grants 2.0 roadmap. With a cost center, you can set and maintain a strategy. With this work, we have to innovate every round and try to stay ahead of the attacks as the honeypot gets larger and larger.     annika:  That said, I do worry about FDD\u2019s rising costs   In relation to what? Other workstreams? We have a lower rate of increase than the majority. Last season? We lowered our rate of increase from 30% to 9%. Something else?     annika:  the budget request and supporting documents are extremely cumbersome to review   We found last season that although we have clear round over round metrics and seasonal objectives along with specific deliverables, people DO find it confusing still. That is why we added the storytellers stream. It is not redundant with MMM because they are not close enough to the work to explain it. We would work with them. It is a small amount to make sure the rest of the DAO does not rob itself of impact, efficiency, ethics, and income, by simply not understanding our work which is admittedly more complex than most other streams. (Again, the problems we are working on are complex)     annika:  I feel like I need someone to summarize it all for me - and that shouldn\u2019t be the case, given how closely I work with FDD.   So we should or shouldn\u2019t do our storyteller initiative to help communicate this? Would we want the DAO to vote no to funding us because the work we do is in a complex domain and no one has the time to learn about it?  In conclusion I would love to talk with you about each initiative. ",

                    "content": "    kyle:  Being a cost center is not a bad thing, and shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a criticism   I do not view it as a criticism, but as an inaccurate description or at best, part of the story.     kyle:  It\u2019s been difficult to navigate the story line on the value being delivered   We thought so too, so we added a very small budget to be intentional about this during s14.     kyle:  1.1 - Defend Grants Rounds from Sybil Attacks   This is not only for today, but for tomorrow. The ASOP could run without innovation, but it would cease to be effective. We HAVE to innovate every round to keep up with the red team and larger rounds.     kyle:  1.2 - Review Grants to confirm compliance to our rules/policies   Looking at this from a grants 2.0 perspective, we need to give communities who use or fork grants 2.0 a way to be credibly neutral. This is a wildly subjective area     kyle:  1.3 - Defend against collusion attacks   I don\u2019t think the grants 2.0 architecture will solve this through \u201cpolicy\u201d but rather by giving communities tools to provide legitimacy (sybil defense) and credible neutrality (community consent). These communities would then compete for mechanisms that truly work better for their participants. Basically, our longer term strategies for sybil and grant eligibility have a by product of collusion protection, but this has not been a focus in the last few rounds.     kyle:  Generate ML models to run programmatic sybil detection (using the centralized data set, and a growing on-chain data set)   For grants 2.0, users will have a dPoPP. By integrating many services, they will be able to participate meaningfully. By only allowing them to advance by integration, we would be putting new users at a disadvantage in the system. How might we provide the new and disadvantaged users the same access to the system. (That is the point afterall) Our job is to find a way to decentralized the inputs, remove PII from the equation, and still be able to make sense of the rich history of participation users will acquire on dPoPP.     kyle:  Conduct human review of potential Sybils   This is done so algorithmic bias does not co-opt our system. We don\u2019t have a steady true state for what is sybil. If we had zero ethical concerns about the bias of our algorithms, we could remove this, but I think it is best thought of as part of 1.1.     kyle:  Build/invest in tooling to make 1.1 and 1.2 more scalable and approachable   And reduce unwanted bias. Additionally, I think providing a solution which includes legitmacy and credible neutrality to any ecosystem who starts a round is a part of grants 2.0, not just an accessory. If we hand them the 2.0 rails without this protection, they may use 2.0 and get worse results than legacy systems. The reason a community would want to use grants 2.0 is to allocate better. It\u2019s like selling a car without tires. Sure, you can do that, but good luck!     kyle:  Invest in OS and working norms (and operations) for the workstream   Yes. Can we make sure that the machine building the machines of legitimacy and credible neutrality are sustainable without key man issues. Lastly, the desire to define innovation as secondary for FDD is not realistic. Each round the attackers advance their strategies and we need to innovate ours to be effictive. ",

                    "content": "Hey friends on GitcoinDAO  Sorry for the late comment. I\u2019ll express my contribution which will make the case towards us exploring what it takes to push for more evolution and how this passes through sketching how a Sybil Detection DAO could look like, as we can and should perform incentive alignment around our ultimate goal of providing Web3\u2019s best Sybil Detection as a Service.  Most of the current function as well as some challenges of FDD has been described in the discussion here. FDD performs a critical function in GitcoinDAO, as Sybil Resistance and Collusion Resistance are critical for the legitimacy of Grants. This is done through a series of increasingly sophisticated processes that have been developed by the entire FDD group since before the DAO was created, and required because our ecosystem demands ever increasing technical excellence with no compromises whatsoever on transparency, decentralization and community ownership on the input, process and outcome. It has been a process of pioneering both in how we organize (governance of algorithmic processes - i.e. the machine learning pipeline), and how we detect and defend against sybil attacks and collusion (governance by algorithms, in a DAO). Going deep and evolving this critical function is not easy nor trivial, and it can be far from sexy when scratching the surface of what it should be. After all, it is about the ongoing operation and maintenance of GitcoinDAO as infrastructure. It also requires domain expertise to develop, operate, iterate on, and maintain the machine learning sybil detection pipeline. Additionally, FDD has arguably managed to create one of the most distinctive initiatives on Web3 so far in terms of real-world Sybil Account Detection - one of the space\u2019s biggest challenges, especially where quadratic voting is employed. The unique blend of experts together with the holistic / integrated processes that were battle-tested on one of the Web3 mostly used platforms is certainly something to be proud of. Something that can also be leveraged and used by all value-aligned platforms on which their success depends on reaching out to real users without compromising on their privacy or incentive alignments.  Given the above considerations, it can be helpful to also share some thinking about what can be a possible strategic direction and a proposal for next steps. We want to ensure FDD and GitcoinDAO have incentive alignment AND functional alignment to defend against sybils. I have written a tale below that provides an analogy for what is functional alignment in this case. We think it could be possible for FDD to evolve further from a GitcoinDAO core team, to become its own DAO that is a service provider to Gitcoin, and potentially other DAOs. FDD is a critical function for DAO maintenance (especially with Quadratic Voting), but it also may likely be a useful service to other DAOs, which would reduce cost dependencies on GitcoinDAO. This being true, then it could be the best long-term sustainable path by both improving the sybil detection (through bi-directional interface points with other data partners) and reducing the cost to GitcoinDAO as various ecosystem partners will be involved in the usage and cost sharing on this new Sybil Detection DAO.  The next step is to Explore. To sketch how it could look like and to map its limitations and opportunities. To discuss as much as possible while there aren\u2019t points of no return. To have a document which allows the community at large to constructively criticize and reject in detail or in its whole form. This is the core intent and function of the SDD work-stream, and it is expected to take the following form:  Deliverable: A written briefing report that includes:  Definition of a clear purpose and functional remit for SDD Diagrams/sketches of potential SDD token governance and economic systems Summary of the results of discussions with potential data partners and scoping of bi-directional interface points Description of a technical roadmap for making SDD viable Recommended next steps   Method: a 3-phase process, on which:  Phase 1: Freestyle sketching  A strawman sketch will be produced based on the combined knowledge of how the SDD + ecosystem tech & dynamics is playing right now.   Phase 2: Intense Iterations  The strawman sketch will pass through extensive review from SMEs to ensure that its cohesive and viable   Phase 3: Polish & Communicate  The iterated document will be transformed and published into an form that invites public-facing iterations & criticisms       I hope these thoughts help share the broader context going into this function, its value to GitcoinDAO and the broader ecosystem, and the potential strategic direction.   Extra: The Tale of the Decentralized Common Goods Factory and its own Sybil Detection Generator (If is too wacky, replace DCG Factory \u2192 Factory, and Sybil Detection \u2192 Electricity) Let\u2019s imagine a fictitious factory. The Decentralized Common Goods (DCG) Factory, which is owned and managed by the diligent Quadratic Bot, which concerns itself only with maximizing the quality and the positive externalities of what\u2019s being produced. Quadratic Bot knows that the DCG Factory consumes a lot of Sybil Detection energy, and in order to have consistent production results, he decides to purchase and operate its own Sybil Detection Generator, which provides this critical piece of infrastructure to the factory to be autonomous. At some point in time, Quadratic Bot decides that the factory should be less monolithic and that its core functions should be more decentralized and autonomous. As a result of that, the Sybil Detection Generator now has its own manager: Not-Sybil. Not-Sybil, which is as diligent as Quadratic Bot, also only concerns himself with the quality and the positive externalities of what\u2019s produced too. The product in this case is delivering the best Sybil Detection to his users. As the DCG Factory is decentralized and open-source, the commoners of the local village quickly take notice of all the innovation happening inside it, including the Sybil Detection Generator, which is tailored end-to-end for being as optimal as possible for its function. Not-Sybil, observing the demand for Sybil Detection and taking in mind his mission of maximizing positive externalities, decides that it can be a good idea to expand the Sybil Detection Generator capacity and technology for more deeply integrating with the community demands. Quadratic Bot is enthusiastic, but this capacity is way more than he needs, and it is not obvious how the payoff is going to be in terms of the quality improval on the factory products. It may even be a distraction. Quadratic Bot and Not-Sybil are intertwined in a dilemma. There are no questions about the history and the ownership: it was Quadratic Bot who bought and took the risk for the Sybil Detection Ownership. But now that it is being managed by Not-Sybil, the goals are different. Quadratic Bot wants the generator to provide critical services. Not-Sybil wants the generator to provide the best services. How do we untangle that? One option is to re-absorb the Sybil Detection Generator under the Quadratic Bot guidance and dismiss / re-educate Not-Sybil. Make it provide the critical service again. Another one is to imagine a future where the Sybil Detection Generator becomes its own autonomous organization. On which Sybil Detection is also a decentralized common good product too, which is used as a critical service by multiple villages and projects. The future is uncertain and risky. Discovering and mapping it beforehand, and making explicit the landmarks and obstacles can allow for us to have a grasp of the journey without taking points of no return. ",

GitcoinDAO stewards may see FDD going outside it\u2019s critical mandate as not within it\u2019s mandate. While FDD may see it as serving GitcoinDAO\u2019s mission better. The way we solve this is to transparently and publicly discuss the situation. Perhaps FDD should lose some autonomy and scope as to not confuse the stewards, but then it should probably also spin out sybil detection DAO to serve Gitcoin\u2019s mandate if the Stewards agree that it has value and fits within the GitcoinDAO scope.
