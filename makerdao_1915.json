Since launch, we have cycled through ~50mm DAI, with no losses, provided regulars monthly reporting and commentary, and brought it stable, tangible revenues to the DAO. We continuing to build our business around MakerDAO and are asking the community to increase the vault\u2019s debt ceiling to 50mm DAI. We spent about 6 months putting together the legal, partnerships and other terms, and we are also in conversation with the active ProtectorDAO clusters and intends to serve as an arranger through these channels. Until the MetaDAOs are launched, this debt ceiling increase is vital to the continuation of our business and relationship with MakerDAO. Below are the summary of changes we are requesting, and additional documentation is also attached:  Adding in WSFS as the trustee, based on the Trust Indenture put together earlier this year by Christian Petersen and Eli Cohen. Increase vault debt ceiling to 50mm DAI Remove senior co-investor requirement and over collateralization requirement Increase Junior minimum to 20% from 15% Increase stability fee to 4.5% from 3.5%  Additional information is attached for those interested in learning more.  Proposed Term Sheet Company financials, actuals and projections Trust indenture agreement Current portfolio overview Detailed terms and company information  Happy to answer any questions from the community. This post is going to stay open for comments 7-14 days (thanks for helping here @CES_CU ) and then proceed to on-chain poll. *Edit - making sure @Recognized-Delegates see this post. ",

I have reviewed the documents and have some preliminary questions:  You mentioned in the Terms Proposal doc that current outstanding debt is \u201c~15mm\u201d. Can you clarify where is the approximation part from? What ratio of the last batch of fund was invested and what is the average utilization ratio? If I am understanding correctly, stability fee is the payment to Maker. This will include the entire debt ceiling amount or the average of the given month? I\u2019m also curious to hear why you increased the fee by exactly 1%. You showed 4 different loan products. Can I have an idea of how fix-and-flip, rent, personal, and ground-up differ in interest rate, default rate, finance cycle, etc.? Can you have a breakdown of the ratio of these products? In your financial projection sheet, you projected origination count to go from 198 in 2022 to 570 in 2023. This is a ~3X increase. I would assume that you will need to tap into more regions and consumer profiles. Can you elaborate how you expect the expansion to influence the current metrics?  ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the questions @CalBlockchain, please see below:  As of today, the current outstanding debt is ~13.2mm DAI, this is visible on the Centrifuge website, linking it here. The utilization has been as high as ~19mm DAI, however, as we are waiting to make the requested changes, and because of the 75% current senior co-investor covenant, we are placing less loans into the pool, and loans are paying off at a good clip. Yes, stability fee is the interest payable to the DAO. We proposed increasing from 3.5 to 4.5 based on what we have seen being proposed by other RWA counterparties, we are happy to take input from the community here. Correct, we offer 4 different loans as a company, however, Personal loans (these are unsecured  consumer loans, and we partner with various of consumer lenders like LendingClub and SoFi that originate those) and Rent (these are 30 year fixed mortgages, and we partner with a few institutional lenders that originate those) loans are not intended for this vault, they are just to illustrate the lines of business New Silver is engaged in. Fix and Flip and Ground Up are essentially the same loan, the only slight differences are how we underwrite them - more experience, higher credit score and other additional requirements are required for Ground Up. We anticipate the portfolio to include approximately 15% of ground up loans, and 85% fix and flip loans. We have been capital constrained for a period of time now. We believe we have built a superior product for user experience, speed of execution, while keeping our costs low by utilizing technologies were others are not. We believe with additional capital, we will be able to increase volumes significantly. In addition, even if we are not able to hit our projected volumes, we anticipate deploying the full 50mm DAI facility in 6 months or less.  Thank you. ",
