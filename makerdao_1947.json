Specification  Motivation Following the recent self-offboarding of the previous CES-001 Facilitator, and after what it looks like a successful interim process, I am proposing @Retro  for the Core Unit Facilitator role.  Retaining Valuable Talent Retention of valuable talent is crucial to the success Maker. The commitment and skills of the CES team can help tackle the next milestones for the Endgame  and as well as the technical side of collateral onboarding, governance security, among others.  Retro  Retro has shown the thoroughness to make sense of a messy transition while blending in with the team. He has shown passion and commitment since the beginning. Retro has shown possibly the most tenacity that Maker has ever seen. It seems hard to remember someone that has joined and so quickly became involved helping wherever he was needed. Retro has re-enabled the key resources at the Core Unit to deliver on their mandate and guided the team to continue serving the DAO.   Core Unit ID  CES-001   Facilitator name and information  Name: Retro Maker Forum handle: @Retro  Twitter account: @0xRetro  Github account: @0xRetro  Discord account: @Retro#1428   Facilitator commitment As a facilitator of this Core Unit, I understand that I play a critical role in building and maintaining a healthy and productive Core Unit. I commit to the following:  Facilitation: I will be responsible for facilitating discussions, decision-making, and conflict resolution within the Core Unit and with the DAO. This includes creating agendas, moderating meetings, and ensuring that the stakeholders have an opportunity to participate. Communication: I will maintain regular communication with the stakeholders, keeping them informed about ongoing projects, decisions, and updates. Accountability: I will be accountable to Governance and act in their best interests. This includes ensuring that decisions are made transparently and fairly, and that conflicts are resolved in a timely and respectful manner. Leadership: I will be a leader in the DAO and set an example for other members. This includes modeling behavior that fosters collaboration, inclusivity, and respect. Time commitment: I understand that I need to commit a significant amount of time to the role, including attending regular meetings, responding to messages and emails, and staying up-to-date on relevant discussions and decisions.

All work related to the management of the business side of RWAs has already been offboarded from CES, and was never part of the CES mandate. So I have no intent to get involved with this specific work domain. The ongoing work in the Collateral Engineering Services CU is primarily of technical nature, focused on delivering smart contract work such as deploying new crypto collateral types, RWA vaults, and executive spells. I am entirely equipped to lead this work as I have already been doing this the past year at CES. Furthermore I have previous leadership experience from the Maker Foundation where I managed a similar sized engineering team. I will post my credentials in the top post later today. ",
