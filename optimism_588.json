Which is why we are passionate about providing technical support and high level security integration for projects from all blockchains and backgrounds. DeFi and web3 in general can be overwhelming, especially considering the amount of due diligence and analysis that stems from engaging with each new project. White Hat DAO aims to lower the risk of entry to web3 space by providing a safety rating platform to aggregate safety and security data on web3 projects, and act as a hub for web3 infosec activity. We are now ready to receive Safety Rating applications to fast track Optimism projects. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Defi lost 3.1 billion USD in funds last year to hacks, and what we are building can easily be used to not only inform people of the types of information that need to be known when they DYOR but also allow the good projects who care about the safety of their members to shine. We have seasoned developers and industry experts who are diligently working to provide training and educational resources for the good of web3.  image11044\u00d7617 114 KB  Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Our due diligence will provide much needed clarity & security/safety details on projects deployed in the OP ecosystem to reduce fraudulent activities by bad actors. When people are comfortable putting their hard-earned coins into a project, it makes the ecosystem much stronger. When the ecosystem is more durable it most definitely will bring more new builders to the ecosystem. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Our project\u2019s aim is to increase awareness of the data points that need to be researched when coming to a new ecosystem, favoring those projects who have taken the time to develop innovative ways to attract new users rather than scammy, spammy projects that the ecosystem is currently littered with. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: We believe a better educated community and project transparency will increasingly become the norm, and organizations like ours will be at the forefront of such education. Developers who make their product in a healthy ecosystem and have increased success of their project will stick around, and we feel Optimism is poised to become the leading L2 chain. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: https://whitehatdao.com/safety-ratings  Github: White Hat DAO \u00b7 GitHub   Safety Rating Application form:  image2908\u00d7255 54.8 KB  Do you have any metrics on the project currently ? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We aim to onboard 80% of the projects in Optimism to our safety rating platform.  With proper funding we can keep developing our security infrastructure.  Due to the decentralized nature of the project, we have no limit to how many projects we can onboard. Our safety rating is a public good service, paid for & by grants received by organizations interested in growing a healthy, safe, and secure ecosystem.  image3955\u00d7689 68.8 KB  As the new users come into the space, it\u2019s our responsibility as a community to provide web3 education on project due diligence & how to be safe. Our platform will help users get most of the relevant data in the easiest way possible. That includes Safety rating & Smart Contract Security Assessment Details  image4885\u00d7441 110 KB  Project Token Distribution & Critical data -including project multisig address  image5876\u00d7296 52.2 KB  Key metrics on Security Audit:  image61694\u00d7433 50.1 KB  Market Performance  image7843\u00d7441 84.6 KB  Exchanges listed:  image8842\u00d7115 16.6 KB  Connecting people behind the project  image9848\u00d7449 140 KB  Disclaimer: Crypto assets are speculative, complex and involve significant risks, which can be highly volatile and sensitive to secondary activities. It\u2019s performance is unpredictable and past performances are no guarantee of future performances. DYOR !! Optimism protocol metrics  image101013\u00d7697 69.1 KB  Currently on average 3.2k contracts are being deployed in Optimism, Many of these contracts are not audited by the project team, We are here to provide a better service in quest of web3 safety & security. We are in the early stage of our development, Our goal is to provide critical details of individual projects to web3 users for proper due diligence. Through our safety rating application, founders can submit info for public view, such as smart contract security assessment, source code, market analytics, key metrics data on token allocation, liquidity pool data, due diligence on the team behind their project and much more. Our aim is to keep the web3 space safe from any exploits, rug pulls, bad actors, and provide details regarding compromised smart contracts, wallets, and publish findings in an easily digestible manner. This will help people make their own rational & educated decisions when transacting on-chain and interacting on any protocol. It will help build trust & a safer environment. Who are your competitors?: We are not here for competition; rather, we would like to work with all projects from different content niches and industries as long as we can raise awareness within the web3 space on safety and responsibilities. That being said, projects like RugDoc.io and DeFiSafety have similar goals but they do not include a DAO governance structure. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Safety Rating is very much composable with the OP eco-system. Security details & safety rating of our platform will be available to other projects via API for free. We aim to promote a safer environment for the entire web3 space. Team Who are your founders?

(Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post 2: [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: We have raised some funds via Gitcoin Grants & Layer2 DAO.We can maintain our infrastructure for another 6 to 8 months with current level of funding that we have received in our multisig treasury. Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? This grant can help impact the OP ecosystem by WHD providing and maintaining a Web3 Safety Rating including a safety rating leaderboard. All OP projects will be free to apply for a Safety Rating. Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Creation of Safety Rating API Create NFT Quest for Onboarding Formalized Safety Training & development Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) We have not launched our governance token yet. Apart from that all our work products are open sourced and can be found via our Github link. Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: At this point of time we can carry out most of our activities without this OP token grants as we have raised some funds from Gitcoin & L2DAO grants. However it will be nice to have further support to carry out developments to build a robust community. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up? 20,000 OP - for safety rating analysis, verification, doing Due-Diligence & maintaining a robust infrastructure, including hosting data and any fees incurred over time. 15,000 OP - for of training and onboarding new analysts and safety rating curators 3,000 OP - for improving our safety rating procedure, Code of conduct. 2,000 OP - for marketing our safety rating initiative 10,000 OP - for due diligence tools & platform development Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period.  image111340\u00d7732 160 KB  Q1 - 2023 We have gone live, with DAO Framework and DAO Constitution already completed. WHD Platform and Safety Rating apps are live and undergoing further optimization. We are ahead of schedule on our Q1 goals. Q2 - 2023 Onboard 500 projects on Safety Rating App, Development of our Ambassador Program(Partnerships) Quest-based DAO Membership application(Sybil Resistance) Release of 10k Membership NFTs, of which at least half should be owned by the end of the year. Q3 - 2023 Governance App Decentralized Community Forum On-chain Governance Mechanism Live Safety Rating API creation Governance Token Launch Distribution of Governance tokens Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Critical Milestone by end of Q1 - 2023 DAO frameworks, DAO Constitution, and WHD platform live Critical Milestone by end of Q2 - 2023 Safety Rating application for web3 projects ( Rating on fungible and non-fungible tokens ) Example:  https://whitehatdao.com/safety-ratings Quest-based DAO Membership application(Sybil Resistance) Critical Milestone by end of Q3 - 2023 API integration for Optimism NFT platforms ( such as NFTEarth and other platforms ) to provide critical safety data for public users to do due diligence for projects onboarded on our platform Critical Milestone by end of Q4 - 2023 Governance Token Launch and distribution of Governance tokens Critical Milestone by end of Q1 - 2024 Membership NFT-gated decentralized governance application with community discussion forum live Release of 10k Membership NFTs with embedded utility such as access to governance discussion, submitting DAO proposals, and ability to vote on proposals Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Yes. Currently Defi has a real problem onboarding new users and even supporting seasoned investors. Copy-pasting of projects not owned by the native organizations can and will be a huge problem until a standard is developed. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Our Safety Ratings are already being implemented as a verification system for previously funded Optimism grant recipients and we have extended our due diligence services to the rest of the Optimism ecosystem. Our proposition is to be the standard in due diligence on Optimism. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Many people believe so, including our team of seasoned professionals which is why we are so dedicated to this project. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We are 100% committed to building on Optimism Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes we are an OP native project. However our services will include 8 other chains as well, mainly providing security audits of smart contracts & safety ratings. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes Note:  Please feel free to reach out for additional details.  More information can be provided upon request. Kind regards, White Hat DAO ",
