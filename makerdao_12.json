The Highlights  Avalanche\u2019s Pangolin Exchange saw nearly 1.7 million DAI enter its network - representing over a 70% increase in DAI on the exchange. Over 33 million DAI moved to Klaytn following the announcement that it would be piloting the Bank of Korea\u2019s CBDC. ApeSwap, UniSwap, and PolyCat continue to take root on Polygon (MATIC) with 104%, 49%, and 33% respective increases in circulating Dai.

Also I am wondering in this weekly report can we get a report on the following: Maker protocol DAI interest earned for  the week? DAI borrowed? DAI repaid? and net DAI in the markets (DAI borrowed - DAI repaid). Since all DAI originates in main net vaults I think the key metric is to look at DAI generation as well as DAI payments.   Also since MakerDAO and MKR holders all benefit from DAI earned for the week this would be a nice graphic (weekly DAI earned)   Please and Thank you in advance. I know this isn\u2019t DAI on Different networks so if there is another report with these numbers please point me to it.   If there is no such report please consider adding the above and changing this report to be a state of DAI in the World! ",

So, either token tracking is iffy or the user base is low, and since the C-chain is EVM compliant - it makes sense that it would grow first. Definitely did.     Solution Circulating Dai Dai Holders     Avalanche C-Chain 213,727,329.69 2,453   Avalanche P-Chain 0 0   Avalanche X-Chain 9,978,886.00 ?     The Contract (C) is EVM compliant, allowing for project copy/pasting for devs and easier bridging for end-users. Platform (P) chain controls validators and creates \u201csubnets\u201d or sharded side-chains The Exchange (X) chain is used for the creation and exchange of assets.  Nothing happening on P or X, but the C-chain is rolling. Found out DAI was originally bridged using the Avalanche Bridge and later replaced with the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge (AEB), which added a mint-burn function to transfer ERC20 tokens, mint an on-chain equivalent (DAI.e), and burn the original token - meaning two ERC20 DAI exist on the chain.   Original Dai is sitting at around 1.25 million in circ supply and came through the first bridge.   Dai.e was bridged via the AEB and its circ supply is over 212 million.   Any chance you have some sources for wallet data? Not finding too much on individual holders, but some solid volume going through Pangolin. ",

I keep wondering if we need to see DAI metrics as % of total float.  Numbers go up and down.  I keep thinking % of float may be just as important as raw TVL in $$. Weekly change in Tokens Bridged?   I\u2019d like to see this as just a table of numbers with weekly changes noted.  That tells me more than the pie chart.    Another interesting look again isn\u2019t as TVL in USD but in terms of % of MC of the token. I honestly am trying to fathom how BSC has so dang much TVL bouncing around.   There is so much I question about metrics in relation to BSC but I don\u2019t have the time to deep dive into BSC.  It just sticks out as a quandry as to how they could get such a large TVL so fast\u2026 Interesting 16.5M on xDAI \u2018unknown\u2019 Thank you again for the report.  Always interesting. ",

It\u2019s definitely a sidechain - multi-sig bridge, governance token, unique dapps, the whole nine yards. But it also mostly functions as an ETH scaling solution and bridge to and from BSC. Idk, sort of a  hybrid between a block ecosystem and an L2 - kind of like Poly before it bought a zk? Either way, gonna take it out next week to zoom in on the Rollups! The TVL chart is from Etherscan and honestly doesn\u2019t get updated enough. Working on getting that one migrated into Dune, and all in on adding % MC. With you on BSC - total circ has barely moved since I\u2019ve been tracking it, but plenty of interchain activity\u2026 xDAI doesn\u2019t have much for tracking. The only real sources are the total locked in the POA token bridge, HoneySwap\u2019s metrics, and the Chai data from daistats\u2026 so definitely a work in progress. Appreciate the feedback!   I\u2019ll do some digging into BSC and see what comes up! ",

The platform\u2019s goal was to simplify the process of bridging and swapping tokens between several blockchain ecosystems including Binance, Ethereum, Polygon, NEO, Ontology, and HECO.

Priority fees will be sent to validators, and base fees will be burned. This means xDai will be burned on every block. The burn will create a mismatch between burned xDai and the Dai used to create xDai, which will still be locked in the bridge contract. To maintain token & bridge equilibrium, the extra Dai in the contract must also be reduced in the same exact proportions. The team is developing a mechanism to use the extra Dai to buyback-and-burn STAKE on Ethereum. This process will create a deflationary mechanism for STAKE with the aim of enhancing overall POSDAO security.   Bridges  https://omni.xdaichain.com/   Thoughts?
