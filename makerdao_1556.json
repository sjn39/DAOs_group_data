This uncertainty is likely creating friction among current and potential vault holders; They are wondering whether to increase their leverage (and create DAI) or not. It\u2019s hard to known for certain what people are thinking, but the peg is above 1.0, the DSR set to zero, and the stability fee at 0.5% \u2026 for days! I believe there is substantial fear, uncertainty, and doubt infecting current and prospective vault users. This poll does not try to determine the exact compensation formula. Correct me if I am wrong, but I\u2019ve read that about $8 million was lost. About 2/3 of the auction failure was absorbed by the Maker protocol and, as I write, is being recapitalized. I expect the defensible loss to vault holders was in the range of $1-3 million. If this poll passes then we\u2019ll figure out how much to repay, raise the funds by minting and selling MKR, and airdrop DAI into the respective accounts. This does not have to happen immediately, but could take place over 1-3 months (TBD).     No compensation Low compensation Medium compensation High compensation I disagree with the options in this poll (details below)     0 voters     If the poll finds general support for compensation, it will be important to conduct an on-chain poll so that MKR holders (whose investment will be diluted) have a chance to weight in.

This loss is absolutely on MKR holders (they are responsible for ensuring that the protocol works s intended) and they need to take the fall here to the full extent. Also why should Maker not commit to compensate in ETH? that is how the protocol was supposed to work. If your collateral ratio falls below 150% some of your ETH collateral is sold to cover the borrowed amount and you receive the remaining ETH back. If people get compensated in DAI how could you possibly set a price on the ETH people lost. Everyone got liquidated at a different price level and there is high probability ETH price will go up a lot by the time we get compensated. Why would we add more to the losses of people who already lost their life savings? ",

I don\u2019t agree with these points personally, but I\u2019m copying it here so I don\u2019t forget to include these points in the on-chain poll.    Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!    This is crypto, all the information as to how the liquidations took place is available on-chain in the form of smart-contract code, due to this, you had the opportunity to be fully informed as to how it works, the fact that you were not is your mistake, not ours. The keeper bot code is open-source, as is the contract code. You were able to learn how to run a keeper in order to liquidate your own vault at a favourable rate. The fact that you didn\u2019t is your mistake, not ours. You were liquidated, and directly caused the Maker Protocol to lose money because you failed to keep a safe-enough collateralization ratio. This is intrinsically negative (hence why there is a liquidation penalty). When you opened a Vault you \u2018agreed\u2019 to keep it collateralized. You broke that agreement, so why should we compensate you? It\u2019s your responsibility to understand the tools you use, the fact that you did not understand that 13% was the penalty after liquidation (which can return less than 150%) is your mistake, not ours. In the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you. By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.    ",

I did agree to keep it collateralised and maker agreed to take my eth to pay back my loan not all my eth. 3) You didnt make this clear ANYWHERE, you intentionally marketed yourselves WITHOUT letting the user know the risks.    Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!   n the case of high network utilisation, users just need to set a higher gas price to get transactions through promptly, the responsibility for knowing how to use ethereum during times of high network congestion is also on you.   This is the only valid point.    Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!   By compensating Vault users now, we set a precedent where we will compensate vault users in the future, this could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.   Yes, it will force you not to make such mistakes in the future and take some responsibility in the way you market your products going forward. Again, as i said before the question should be how to compensate not if. Non of these points are valid or fair. ",
