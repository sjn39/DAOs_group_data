Our protocol allows for a safer and more robust DeFi ecosystem by ensuring each user can only get one identity. This serves as a form of sybil resistance, bot prevention, cross-ecosystem identification of fraud and a robust credit score system. We would love to chat about the possibility of integrating within the Maker ecosystem. We believe that we could provide additional security for airdrops and that our credit score could be used to offer a higher range of services such as undercollateralized lending. Would love to chat, Solal ",

Also, I applaud your ability to introduce your protocol in a decentralized fashion. It feels like Maker is not a fit at the moment as it is prioritizing other products and business lines, optimizing for long-term scalability and risk mitigation. Have you tried approaching Aave or Compound? Feel like a good place to start. ",

For Maker, this idea is implemented via Institutional Vault where large vault user with credible background is able to enjoy better rates. Now there are certain obstacles as this only allows vaults that are willing to mint hundreds of millions but at the same time, from Maker protocol\u2019s perspective, small vault users are crucial but trying to have different rates for each one might cost more in development and overhead cost ",

In contrast we focus on self sovereign identity but also accountability (preventing fraud, bots, etc) We do this by using Zero Knowledge proofs to aggregate data over all of a users wallets in a way that does not link the wallets. This means that if someone were to have defaulted on a loan on one wallet, this would show if they used another wallet. We are currently re-writing our whitepaper, docs and landing page, here is a slightly outdated version of our documentation which explains the ideas (the protocol design has changed slightly). Notebook - Notebook Docs 1.0 Yes exactly our vision is that right now only large institutions are able to gain better rates, our mission is to be able these benefit for smaller users. Obviously this would take some time to develop, but I think that the community would greatly benefit from it and that it would reward smaller users that have been very loyal to the ecosystem. If there is enough interest, I would love to chat. ",
