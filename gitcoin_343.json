                    "content": " Summary A small number of Etherian magicians and longevity enthusiasts, including Vitalik Buterin are building a \u201cpop up city.\u201d This proposal explores ways Gitcoin could support this event with resources (time and financially), and deliver impact for the Ethereum community, Gitcoin and the general growth and funding of public goods to help build \u201cpop up cities\u201d. Below you will find details for how we might support, grow and build lasting relationships, processes, and support for those looking to stand up pop up cities and fund their shared needs in the future.  Abstract Zuzalu is a new concept proposed by a core team of builders with the goal of building intentional community amongst like minded individuals in a location that offers those participating a positive social environment for learning, being healthy and coordination. This pop up city has the support of the local government. This support extends to housing locations, visa applications and some other real life requirements (like utilities, internet, etc.). Vitalik is personally subsidizing a large percentage of costs incurred by this experiment, an incredible gift and experiment in collaboration with the broader Ethereum community. I believe Gitcoin should help make this event successful and help fund public goods for Zuzalu so that learnings from this experiment can be replicated elsewhere. It is a rare opportunity that we might help support the creation of a new city and enforce the value of funding, building and supporting public goods (values core to Gitcoin that we now have an opportunity to support IRL). Gitcoin is known for our ability to rally and empower communities to fund their shared needs, and with the expertise we have, I believe we can help shape a regen culture for these newly emerging pop-up communities and provide valuable technical infrastructure as Gitcoin to empower communities, like Zuzalu, to allocate capital to community members in a highly democratic way.  Motivation Gitcoin has been invited to support Zuzalu in a number of ways, and it is my strong opinion we should rise to this occasion and support in a fiscally responsible, but open hearted way. Below we outline a few of the ways Gitcoin can support this event without trying to coop the intent, or the outcomes! I (Janine) have been invited to lead and support the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d initiatives. My experience in building intentional communities and planning, hosting and cultivating meaningful in-person events and love of public goods leaves me in a unique situation to dive in head first and ensure the event is successful (more on that below). We as Gitcoin have a unique opportunity to showcase the Allo protocol, and fund a Public Goods round for the event participants. This QF round will support the collective funding of Zuzalu\u2019s shared needs, which are shaping up to be quite expansive (basic necessities, OSS projects being developed, experiences, etc.) It is our intention to support Zuzalu in a way that brings back learnings for how to apply funding models to local communities. Said differently, we want to build a playbook for how Allo protocol can be leveraged to fund shared needs. And we want to do this in a way that does not shill our protocol as the only solution, but instead invites learnings and feedback to help us improve.  Specification This proposal is broken down into four main categories: Resourcing and the tasks those resources will be taking, protocol support with details and timing thoughts, matching pool funding to enable the round, timeline and expectations for the longevity of scope.  Resourcing I am requesting $82,000 in funding to support myself and 3-4 other team members in coordinating, leading and executing the Zuzalu event in coordination with the core planners on the initiative. We will cover the following scope:  Event Logistics and project (or city) management Team and volunteer building and management On-site Public Goods conference event   Protocol Support In an effort to showcase Allo, and gather feedback from participants of Zuzalu and beyond we would like to run a Quadratic Funding round where Allo is used with support from our team (PGF, Allo Workstream, MMM, etc.). There is no direct cost associated with this request, but it would inject minor requirements to their seasonal commitments. We expected that work to entail:  Operating the Zuzalu Public Goods round so both local Zuzalu residents and those who cannot be there but want to participate virtually can Promoting the grants round to the broader Ethereum community to support high impact projects   Matching Pool Funding The Zuzalu team would love to run a Quadratic Funding round for Zuzalu, and Gitcoin has the ability to step up as a primary funder of this event. By pledging $100k from our matching pool, we can incentivize community members to participate and fund Zuzalu\u2019s shared needs and public goods more broadly to support intentional community building. This request feels like a small amount of money, with a large impact on the Zuzalu experiment, especially given the generosity of Vitalik\u2019s involvement in our Grants Matching pool to date (dog tokens) and constant support marketing every grants round. It would be incredible to support a project that is not just pushing forward technology in the crypto ecosystem but also the broader social and cultural infrastructure we live in. I\u2019d love to see Gitcoin support Zuzalu in this experiment.  Timeline and Duration of Scope Zuzalu is scheduled to kick off on March 25 and run through May 25 2023. I am planning to continue to focus my time energy on this project during its duration, with some minor wrap up period. If the DAO agrees to support the grants round, our involvement will run throughout the course of Zuzalu and ideally help gather feedback and ideas for new features on grants stack or builds on the Allo protocol. As such, our budgeting request is to cover costs during the duration of the first IRL Zuzalu.  Benefits There are numerous benefits to supporting this event. I have outlined below some of the reasons that stand out:  Legitimacy - We have an unique opportunity to showcase our ability to support novel experiments in the Ethereum Ecosystem. Our support showcases our expertise in community building, event facilitation and also offers us the ability to get feedback on our protocols. This will broaden our legitimacy as experts in enabling communities to fund their shared needs, and also sharpen our ability to deliver impactful results with our efforts. Grow Public Goods - Zuzalu has a unique opportunity to build Zuzalu Public Goods so the rest of the world can benefit from this experiment freely and openly. In addition, there is a planned Public Goods week (PGw) at Zuzalu where Gitcoin can play a part in furthering our Grant Program\u2019s goals of funding public goods. Development - Zuzalu is positioned as a two month long hackathon. Having boots on the ground who can support interest in Allo protocol, and Passport will be immensely valuable in seeding the development of novel dApps on the protocols. Though this is not a primary goal (ie, we do NOT want to shill!), we do expect there to be genuine interest that can be best supported through direct involvement in the event. Relationships - Deep participation in an event like this builds and strengthens relationships with those at the forefront of innovation and experimentation in our Ethereum Ecosystem. We will develop meaningful relationships translating into future funding partners, protocol devs, grantees and contributors to public goods. Showcasing Gitcoin\u2019s excellence will invite novel opportunities for us to expand our reach and network. Funding - We know that while this opportunity is largely being funded by one individual, that can\u2019t be the model moving forward. Learning from this experiment to help future Zuzalu\u2019s allocate funds has value. Talent - If this is a success, it will help us attract talent to our DAO and hopefully to the regenerative side of crypto as a whole.  This list is likely not exhaustive but showcases the intentionality we have in pursuing involvement and support for Zuzalu.  Drawbacks While the benefits list is large, it is not without potential drawbacks. I have tried to offer those drawbacks as honestly as possible, but I am biased given my desire and interest in seeing us support Zuzalu.  Resourcing - It was recently announced Annika will not be returning to Gitcoin after her maternity leave. Me stepping away to focus on supporting Zuzalu will both open opportunities for two team members, but also test the PGF team and their ability to plan our next Grants round (scheduled for the end of April). We have already started to put a plan in place to ensure they will be successful, but there will likely be unforeseen risks. Capital - funding an initiative like this won\u2019t be free, and my request comes at a time when Stewards are calling for more focus and reduced spending. I am proposing this as I believe the ROI is significantly larger than the cost, but the cost are real. Distraction - Zuzalu could be considered a distraction to our most important thing (Allo protocol). While I understand that the launch of our Allo protocol is our most important focus area, I actually feel like this is in an effort to ensure that launch is successful, by positioning it as a possible solution for how Zuzalu may fund its shared needs. Measurement of outcomes - The timeline for this event is rapidly approaching and we do not have the ability to be as thoughtful in how we might measure success (to then report back on if we actually delivered the outcomes we set out to achieve). There are ways to mitigate this, but the credibly neutral analysis on if this had the impact we expected will likely be difficult to generate.  This list is likely not exhaustive but showcases the potential drawbacks to our approach. I would encourage feedback and discussion if folks feel there are others that we should mitigate!  Vote I am proposing this vote with three options, and will not post this with an abstain to prevent that option from being the one chosen. Here are the three options: 1 - Vote yes to completing funding the initiative with the requested resources and matching pool funds:  $100k in Matching Pool funds $82K in remuneration for the team working to deliver this event and these outcomes.  2 - Vote yes to funding the initiative, but not offering the matching pool funds for the event.  $82K in remuneration for the working team and events at Zuzalu  3 - Vote yes to funding the matching pool, but not offering remuneration for the team work:  $100k in Matching Pool funds  4 - Vote No on financially supporting the event in any capacity. 5 - abstain (edited based on @krrisis  comment below) If during our discussion period more voting options are presented that the community would like us to include, we will do that as well.

Is it possible to breakdown expenses vs contributor comp? Can contributor team itself be eligible to be part of the QF round as opposed to upfront comp?

I do have lots of questions that pop up that I\u2019d like to have answered before I cast a decision. I\u2019m hoping the answers to these questions will help guide me and other stewards on how to make this decision. Please read these questions as genuine curiosities, not trying to drive toward any agenda. I am genuinely open to voting for any of the options presented (and then some). Though this is a single GCP, I\u2019m seeing two separate requests here:  100k from the matching pool 82k for Zuzalu event coordination   Matching Pool Funds Q\u2019s     J9leger:  support the collective funding of Zuzalu\u2019s shared needs, which are shaping up to be quite expansive (basic necessities, OSS projects being developed, experiences, etc.)   What does \u201cother experiences\u201d mean? Is this parties and dinners? Or other activities? Or is this more related to the hackathon that will be happening?  Coordination Sponsorship Q\u2019s  82k seems like a very exact request, and it is for 3 or 4 people. Is it 3 people? Or is it 4? I\u2019m unclear how our commitment to coordinate is being scoped. If we gave less than 82k and only funded 1 or 2 people, would that give us less exposure than funding 3-4? Will funding 5-6 contributors give us more? I\u2019m trying to understand the logic of this ask. If we don\u2019t take this opportunity, will someone else get it?  I echo @jengajojo\u2019s questions for clarity around comp since I\u2019m not fully understanding the connection between Gitcoin paying for coordinating Zuzalu & running a matching round. I\u2019m also curious about what other orgs/DAOs have pledged financial support.  Governance Mainly a question for @shawn16400 around potential conflict of interest. There are about a dozen Gitcoiners going to Zuzalu (several of them are large token holders) that will likely directly benefit from the passing of this proposal (both the coordination efforts AND the matching funds distribution). Are there any risks from a governance perspective that might have us setting a bad precedent? Just want to make sure we are covered here.  Marketing I\u2019d love to hear thoughts from some of our marketing-expert stewards (@ebransom, @dianarichter, @abigailcarlson). I personally see this as a sponsorship opportunity. In my 1-1/2 years at Gitcoin, I haven\u2019t seen a sponsorship outside of a hackathon. Now we are being asked for an 82k sponsorship for this event and I\u2019m not 100% sure how to approach it or its direct ROI. How would you all evaluate this opportunity? What would need to be true for it to be a \u201cyes\u201d to sponsor? ",

                    "content": "@J9leger thanks for this, this sounds like an amazing experiment and I hope this has lasting impact. Secondary from the proposal, this is a good illustration of the Gitcoin budgeting gap.  Outside of workstream budgeting process, we have no additional controls on how to budget for / allocate sources and uses of funds like this.   Said another way, how many Zuzalu-type events can we afford in 2023?  What about 2024?  Who is responsible to create this auxiliary budget and who is going to ensure we stay within the bounds of this budget? @krrisis is doing work on a plurality of budgeting options for S18, but the broader scope I am thinking of is not covered and will likely need to be done in S19.     CoachJonathan:  There are about a dozen Gitcoiners going to Zuzalu (several of them are large token holders)       CoachJonathan:  Are there any risks from a governance perspective that might have us setting a bad precedent? Just want to make sure we are covered here.   Wow, great we have so many joining!  And yes, that is a potential conflict of interest (COI).  Recall a conflict of interest is any situation in which a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity.  So, if a token holder stands to receive material benefit (not available to others), this can be a perceived (or real) conflict of interest. Best practices for managing a conflict of interest are to:  Declare you have a potential COI Abstain from voting for the proposal - It can be argued that you can vote against a COI, but best practice is abstain.  Recall the threshold is a \u201cperceived\u201d COI - not an \u201cactual\u201d COI.  Said another way, if you have to argue \u201cI don\u2019t have a COI because of\u2026\u201d you should probably abstain. ",

I figured I would offer some of my thoughts, but I also recognize that this one has been tough to navigate given some of the precedent we have set (ie, we dont sponsor events). As usual, I am but one node and would love to engage in conversation if folks feel like I have blind spots. Splitting this request into two: 1 - The matching pool funds - I am highly in favor of us hosting and supporting this round. This seems like a no brainer as it\u2019s in a category we have historically supported, with a group that has given millions in funding to Gitcoin\u2019s matching pool. This gives us the ability to run a QF round with folks outside our immediate community ahead of launching Allo and generally is a tremendous way for us to grow funding available for public goods. It is highly aligned with our \u201dsecond most important thing\u201d and speaks to why Gitcoin\u2019s soul (our grants program) is thriving! There is no doubt that we can \u201cmake up\u201d the funds in other ways (like with our RocketPool funding, or gtcETH funding, etc.). Yes please to running a round if we can support it. We have 13 rounds to knock out, and this is a great one to support! 13 5 5  2 - The sponsorship of the event. This is a bit tricky as I suspect Janine is going to run this event with or without our funding. It sounds like she already has a couple people in place supporting her, and the real question to me is\u2026 do we want to compensate those folks from Gitcoin\u2019s treasury, or do we want them to seek payment from other places (or even further, should we do this retroactively if the value to Gitcoin is clear/measurable?)? I have a couple other questions on where the 82k number came from and how it\u2019s being allocated, which will hopefully make this an easier decision. I would love more clarity on this number and love the suggestion from @atris on reimbursing expenses with reasonable compensation figures for the work being performed. As for a COI - I am torn on whether a COI actually exists here. Janine has already been running point and working to support Gitcoin\u2019s participation agnostic of the vote here. If we decided not to approve the funding (either/both pools requested), I don\u2019t think it would change the goodwill she has extended, or that the Zuzalu team has extended based largely on the stellar work Janine is doing. I am curious to get other people\u2019s perspectives on this as I am planning to attend the event for a couple weeks at the onset of the pop up city. Inclusion of Gitcoiners was never a thing that was predicated on this vote, and candidly Janine decided she wanted to support this prior to knowing if funding was going to be available. So - I would love to support the full initiative but I would like more details on the 82k being voting for that option. I am still mixed on us sponsoring an event like this (by paying for the resources/sponsoring as we don\u2019t normally do this), but perhaps with more details on the 82k I can get to a yes. The matching pool seems like a highly aligned way to spend our matching pool funds - I am here for this! ",

Hey @kyle thank for the input on the perception of a COI, these are a bit sticky and it is important to understand the nuance.  Recall the perception of a COI is independent of good will, stellar work, prior knowledge of funding, or if the work would continue if the proposal failed.  I suspect you agree with this sentiment, but I wanted to drive that point home.  The perception of a COI is simply about personal benefit received, based on actions or decisions made in their official capacity, which is not available to others. If the recipient stands to receive material benefit they would not normally receive, it could be perceived as a COI, and they should abstain from voting.  A parallel could be drawn to our workstream budget process.  Workstream contributors should abstain from voting on their own budget to avoid the perception of a COI. Note that the perception of a COI is not a negative thing and it is no reflection on the strength or weakness of a proposal.  In normal situations, abstaining from a vote for strong and universally supported proposals should not have an impact on the outcome. Why this case might be different is that Janine has 1.68M GTC tokens allocated to her and a simple majority vote is normally around 5-6M tokens for high turn out votes, 3-4M for less active votes.

I like how @CoachJonathan outlined that this is really two proposals as it gives us more room to explore our reactions to this proposal. I hope this kind of delineation is exercised more in the future. I also feel torn about this proposal. The narrative is strong but it leaves me wondering how much of it is based on intuition and historical context vs. strategic vision and our goals for the future. Some questions I have for the wider steward body (not only @J9leger) are:   Are we committed to deepening our engagement with the web3 community OVER finding new playing fields (I know both are important so I\u2019m positioning this as an even-over question)   How much money is a reasonable amount for event spend this year? We\u2019ve already produced the community retreat and Schelling Point (SP) at ETH Denver. We are also exploring another SP activation (likely a smaller pop up) in Paris. I think the DAO as a whole needs to get better at measuring ROI of IRL events.   Running a Round at Zuzalu Many members of the core team are pretty excited about this so I can get on board. One question I have is: what is the eligibility criteria for the round? As someone who isn\u2019t attending, I would like this 100K of our matching pool funds to be spent on meaningful projects vs. parties\u2026but that is for the community of Zuzalu to decide. The beauty of QF! If we decide to contribute this money, is there a chance that our matching pool funds will be used for fancy & fun things or will they exclusively be used to fund experiments that might be replicable beyond Zuzalu? Sponsorship of the Event @J9leger - does this request include your salary for planning the event? Are you one of the 3-4 team members that you\u2019re requesting funding for? I appreciate you asking for what you need and I also appreciate that this opportunity is HUGE for you (and am happy you seized it!). That said, I\u2019m still torn if the DAO should pay for any team members to run this event. I think I can come to a yes to paying your short sabbatical but to break precedent of \u201cno event sponsorships ever\u201d and jumping to an 82K engagement, this feels off to me. My DMs are constantly flooded with less costly opportunities that will expose us to new markets. I get that this is a bit different than a traditional event sponsorship but I\u2019ll say that because sponsorships are top top tippy top of funnel, they really should be used to break into new markets imo. That said, they can also be used to re-establish brand affinity with existing markets \u2013 do we as a DAO feel that we should use this opportunity to re-establish our brand with key players in the ETH ecosystem?

A: yes if elected, the President would receive a salary. Q: Are they voting in an official capacity? A: No, they are voting as private citizens net: No COI.     kyle:  republican/democrat party members will vote for candidates that often are aligned to their values AND often have the perception of improving the lives   Solid, lets test if a Republican has a COI when voting for other Republicans Q: Is the candidate in a position to derive personal (self or family) benefit not available to others? A: No, policy usually impacts classes of voters (benefit to many) not just the individuals. Q: Are they voting in an official capacity? A: No, they are voting as private citizens net: No COI.  The candidate does stand to receive material benefit not available to others, but when the candidate votes, they are voting as a private citizen, and have no more voting power than any other voter.  If they mobilized the military to \u201cprotect\u201d polling locations - that would be another story. An interesting variation might be the Index Fund managers.  Blackrock might have the largest voting block of General Electric (given they retain the voting rights for their index fund investors) and they use that influence to benefit themselves (indirectly) and their shareholders.  Any benefit received is spread over the entire class of shareholders, not just Blackrock, the firm itself.  If Blackrock received a $50M bonus for helping to electing a specific board member to GE - again, that would be another story     kyle:  If my voting power is delegated, and I continually vote for things that have a CoI, my delegators would remove that delegation.   Makes sense, we would assume delegators look for solid character in voting performance.  Although I am not sure how many DAO delegates watch that closely      kyle:  Simply abstaining on a vote for something I believe in because of \u201cperceived CoI\u201d seems undemocratic.   This is an interesting point and it has a very strong lineage.  The basic interpretation of a COI in parliamentary procedure states that abstaining from vote due to a COI is recommended (best practice) but it cannot be compelled. (RONR 11th ed. pp 406-407).  However it is very common that governing bodies modify this statute to be more restrictive.  For example, in Gitcoin DAO Governance Process v3 it states:   Conflicts of Interest In any case where a steward or community member votes on a proposal that directly benefits themselves (e.g. voting to pass their own workstream budget) that steward or community member\u2019s vote will be considered invalid by default. Any steward may raise a claim of conflict to be addressed prior to a vote being finalized on Tally should this apply. If a conflict is found, any related vote must be redone and may be considered passed so long as the steward in conflict abstains and the quorum rules are met.   This Gitcoin statute might be a wee bit more restrictive than necessary, but it is a good reference point.  There are often questions around COIs so I appreciate the chance to discuss this since it was raised in relation to this proposal.  And, also based on the Gov Process v3 above, if a steward calls the vote into question due to a perceived COI after the vote, we could have a real mess. ",
