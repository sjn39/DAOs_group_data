If I want leverage on my ETH, I will borrow Dai against my ETH and sell it for more ETH. If I want liquidity on my ETH to buy a car, I will borrow Dai against my ETH, sell it for USD, and buy my car. For the RWA cases, everyone is selling the borrowed Dai for fiat to interact with TradFi. I understand the loans need to be paid back in Dai and that creates a natural buyer, but there is a massive time lag there. Who is the natural net buyer of Dai? Why has the peg not already gone below $1? ",

As users could gain attractive yields by using Dai for LPing, paying for premium was seen as ok. And though PSM has brought back to peg, the demand especially in DeFi still continues ",

If its over 1 Dollar people use 1xUSDC to buy 1xDai and the PSM prints more Dai. Also the backed loans if someone has a loan they need to buy Dai to pay off their debt so they can redeem their collateral again. There is a constant buy pressure by people.  Just because you listed some examples that show sell pressure doesnt mean there are no examples of buy pressure to equalize that. Also here are other reasons why one would use Dai\u2013> To store your money in a manner that doesnt allow circle or the us government to freeze your assets. People borrowing Dai to speculate to exchange for other tokens is also buy pressure. Not just sell pressure. Also someone buying your Dai for Fiat is also buy pressure from the person that buys it for Fiat. Regardless of the PSM you know that every Dai is backed by more crypto assets than their denomination. And for people to get their collateral back they will have to buy all the Dai eventually to repay their loan. Dai demand is actually so high that the price wouldnt remain 1 Dollar it would be over 1 Dollar if it werent for the PSM: Look at stablecoins like sUSD that trade for a premium because they dont have a PSM (thank god) ",

If its over 1 Dollar people use 1xUSDC to buy 1xDai and the PSM prints more Dai.   Totally follow you there. The question becomes if there is a net sell pressure on Dai, the PSM will eventually run out of money. It isn\u2019t a natural buyer of Dai by itself.     Ber10:  There is a constant buy pressure by people. Just because you listed some examples that show sell pressure doesnt mean there are no examples of buy pressure to equalize that.

The story I am understanding so far for the natural buy pressure of Dai seems to be its integration in yield generating opportunities in crypto. Like the Curve 3pool? ",
