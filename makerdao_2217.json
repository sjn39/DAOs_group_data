The vote to initiate shutdown of SCD on April 24th, 2020 concluded on Monday, April 6th with 61.54% voting in favor of the proposal. The purpose of this signal request is to gather sentiment on an appropriate grace period between the time the SCD shutdown spell is scheduled and the time the system is irreversibly shutdown (in Maker parlance, \u201ccaged.\u201d) In referring to the Sequential Process for SCD Shutdown, Step A Executive Spell 1 was completed when the SAI debt ceiling was set to 0 in MCD via this spell. The options suggested below are the times between the successful scheduling of Step B Executive Spell 2 and the action of calling cage on the SCD system. As of calling cage, Step C begins and Sai owners can claim their collateral. Step D cannot begin until the post-cage cooldown period has ended. Such a grace period should take into account the greater timeline highlighted above, as well as the needs and timeframes of all stakeholders and integration partners. Should you feel a longer time is warranted, please select \u201cOther\u201d and provide your rationale in the thread. Options: 6 pm CET / 4pm UCT on:     Friday, May 1st Friday, May 8th Friday, May 15th Friday, May 22nd Other     0 voters     Thank you for your attention.

At this point given state of the system and that CDP 3088 woke up I am for a longer rather than short time frame here.  I also like idea of doing this on Tuesday as being a operations guy we had a rule on major system changes (not on Mondays or particularly Fridays).   So Tuesdays sound good and because I want this delay longer than shorter to give time to deal with issues on this I picked May 26 and Other (meaning longer).   Looks like a lot of people want this done in much shorter time frame. SCD is at 13.3M and falling and really would like to see the SCD DC go down to $14M.   I am honestly back on the fence about having to hammer this down so fast as it seems to be winding down naturally as the SF is increased and time goes on.  Literally 3-5% drop in SCD SAI outstanding a week.  In 4 weeks we could be at $12, another 4 weeks $10M with nothing left but CDP 3088.  Note here with CDP 3088 at 8+M of that 13.3 the 'other\u2019s are closing at a rate of 10% week. Literally only person that gets hosed significantly here if something odd happens with SCD being open is CDP 3088 the rest totals 5.3M and falling. I think the threatening of the SCD closure has gotten people off their butts to close if they don\u2019t want to be in the GS there though so maybe setting a date with a reasonable time frame (like a month) with an announcement is a good idea to light fires under peoples butts.    I would have loved to get CDP 3088 to close as we would have seen some MKR burn in that case (like 3-3.5K) but we do what we can and move on. ",

Imagine a situation where migration contract gets drained in few days, because fees are effectively already forgiven with MKR oracle shut down (this is how I understood) and every rational CDP should migrate. In such case the only remaining SAI liquidity (primarily only in migration contract, other markets are very shallow) is wiped and CDPs can not deleverage in a ETH crash scenario and protect from liquidations. SAI liquidity can be though sourced from MM opening new CDPs in SCD, but I rather not count on them too much. This is why I believe 3 weeks is too long period. We are primarily doing this to drain migration contract, but I believe it should be drained very quickly if CDPs are aware of fee forgiveness? The good news is that CDPs are now very well collateralized in SCD - if ETH drops to $100 we see 2% of debt or \u201conly\u201d $270k debt liquidated. Majority of liquidations happen at $60-$70 eth range. Maybe this isn\u2019t a huge problem after all but I just wanted to address this. ",

Unfortunately a large CDP soaked up the Sai migration contract liquidity. As a Sai holder or CDP owner, we have two options - either (1) payback Sai to close out the CDP, or (2) wait for shutdown and reclaim the underlying collateral. Q1) The price of Sai will be determined at the time of shutdown by referencing the ETHUSD Oracle feed, where 1unit of Sai will equal $1 of ETH. This oracle is critical to the DeFi ecosystem so cannot be changed and will not be able to average the price over any period of time. Q2) Unfortunately I\u2019m not aware of any teams supplying Sai to the migration contract now that it has been drained, meaning that its necessary to maintain any CDPs until shutdown and redeem for ETH. The CDP owner does of course have the benefit that all stability fees will be forgiven. I think the bitcoin halvening date will beat the time of shutdown, but it certainly will be interesting to see if there are any broader market effects as a result. ",

I\u2019m not sure how large your vault is, but it looks like you can still source Sai on the market pretty reasonably. I\u2019d recommend a dex aggregator like dex.ag or 1inch to get the best prices. I just checked dex.ag and it looks like you can currently buy 10,000 Sai for 9,942 Dai via Kyber. So if you do want to close out your vault now it looks like you can get Sai at a discount, but I don\u2019t know how long that will last. At this point the amount of Sai is diminishing as people close out their vaults, but you can always wait until shutdown and get the excess collateral in your vault back that way. ",
