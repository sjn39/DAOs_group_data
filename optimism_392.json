The impact so far has been extraordinary Since inception in September this year, SavePakistan.crypto has already supported over 2 thousand people with its relief efforts in Mirpurkhas, distributing ration bags, sanitation & H2O wheels to more than 200 families!  1024\u00d7768 230 KB  Save Pakistan\u2019s founding partners on the ground, Tayaba, built the first ever eco-friendly and sustainable sanitation system made from locally sourced materials, such as bamboo, that gets functional within 5\u20137 days, serving up to 60 people. The portable toilets provide a hygienic drainage system through a PVC pipe and a proper water closet system, with an appropriate locking system and cloth cover to ensure privacy. The team set up 10 portable toilets in the Kewro Nuqrich UC Samaro and the Ali Bux Kaloi near Kot Mir Jan. They also pioneered the H2O (Help-2-Others) Wheel, a 40-litre clean water transporter and storage container. The team distributed 70 H2O Wheels to 70 families in the village of Ali Bux Kaloi alone. The ration bags include dry food like sugar (3kg), flour (20kg), rice (5kg), tea (180gm), pulse/lentils (3kg), salt iodized (800gm), and cooking oil (3L), enough to serve 7\u20138 people for 15\u201320 days. The team distributed 200 ration bags to 200 families in Mirpurkhas. The Save Pakistan initiative was created to raise funds and provide emergency relief goods to people affected by floods in Pakistan. The initiative is spearheaded by professionals from Unchain Fund, Tayaba Organisation and climate activists worldwide.  1024\u00d7768 203 KB  CJ Hetherington (@cjh), a Web3 entrepreneur, helping to drive forward the initiative, explained that: \u201cThis is an evolutionary opportunity for members of the Optimism Collective and wider NFT community to own & curate the life saving impact they\u2019re able to provide to the frontlines of a humanitarian catastrophe. With years of experience, the deep rural penetration and modern logistics driven by our founding partners Tayaba in Pakistan and other ground-level NGOs and stakeholders reflect that we can provide instant impact \u2014 saving thousands of lives. We\u2019re very excited to move into this model whereby people can purchase goods like emergency shelters, ration bags & clean water as NFTs and see them provably distributed to families in need on the ground in Pakistan with robust retroactive impact reporting. We\u2019re deeply grateful for the support of the Optimism community!\u201d Previously, Tayaba\u2019s work has been recognised by the Ministry of Water Resources of Pakistan. The founder, Bilal Bin Saqib from Pakistan, is a Web3 enthusiast who has received the Points of Light Award from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for relief work during the COVID-19 pandemic and received a letter of appreciation from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s office. Bilal was also named in Forbes 30U30 Asia. Bilal Bin Saqib mentioned: \u201cThe crypto adoption in Pakistan is tremendous. About 9 Million Pakistanis own cryptocurrencies, and their cumulative ownership amounts to $20B, almost twice the amount in Pakistan\u2019s foreign reserves. Pakistan, the world\u2019s 5th most populous country, is ranked 3rd in Chanialysis Global Crypto Adoption Index 2020\u201321. Yet the government has prohibited the use of crypto; however, an initiative like SavePakistan.crypto does not only help the flood affectees but is also helping lobby the government to ease regulations and policy making towards crypto.\u201d  1024\u00d7768 154 KB   The Multisig Drawing inspiration from Unchain\u2019s previously pioneered model which raised ~ $10M humanitarian aid in Ukraine, including a $2.5M donation from Vitalik Buterin, Save Pakistan disburses all the donations raised from crypto community led initiatives among major grassroots-level partners with deep penetration and access to marginalized and flood-affected areas from a multi-signature wallet controlled by trusted industry leaders.

That\u2019s why I think there has to be an extra effort in making It different and experimenting with ways of doing things crystal clear. This seems a legit project, but I\u2019d appreciate (and the crypto industry) an independent report where there\u2019s a follow-up on how the resources have been delivered, etc. For starters, I would make a public offer to select the best provider in a way that conflict of interest can be avoided. Again, not easy, and not asking for this fund-raising to solve a very complex problem, but it\u2019d be appreciated if some try to go beyond the usual FIAT thing: The best for Pakistan and I hope much money can be raised.

SavePakistan initiative might be the first one to leverage NFTs at such scale to provide humanitarian aid to the frontlines of humanitarian catastrophe in Pakistan. SavePakistan does also fundraise via crypto donations. The notion of NFTs as public good introduces a powerful use case of NFTs tied to real-world relief items - people help save lives, and keep a meaningful NFT \u2018trophy/badge\u2019 of their support. Thanks for noticing the typo @MinimalGravitas - updated the price.

I hear you @TheDoctor, those are valid points. The transparency and trust are vital in humanitarian relief efforts, and, as mentioned - we\u2019re happy to provide the necessary proofs, host community Q&A, and just altogether lead the initiative.
