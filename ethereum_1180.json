I fail to see the advantages of using well-known here - only disadvantages of less e.g. not having \u201cThis EIP was designed with existing API routes in mind to reduce disruption.\u201d Wondering what advantages you see in using .well-known so it would make more sense? That said: you could create another EIP to go the well-known way - I just think it will be an uphill battle to get explorers to adopt - but I think this EIP should not be changed.
