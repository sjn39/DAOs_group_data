                    "content": "Greetings from the Content Production Core Unit!  tl;dr  KPIs and OKRs The situation with our offboarding proposal has clearly gotten out of hand. The Content team has established OKRs and KPIs. Yes, it\u2019s taken time to build the team and get operations in place so we can work toward them more actively but none of the individuals that have referenced our lack of OKRs/KPIs in the onboarding posts have bothered to reach out to myself or the team to see if they exist, nevermind discuss them or do the diligence to find it themselves and that clearly speaks to their intentions. While the team has privately discussed OKRs and KPIs somewhat regularly, a couple of factors have prevented us from reaching the point where we feel like we can focus on them in regular updates:   The lack of clarity around the Maker Foundation\u2019s dissolution, shifting expectations about how and whether or not Core Units are supposed to work together, and ongoing lack of clarity regarding our budget has impacted our ability to grow and operationalize.   Our ability to measure KPIs is dependent on the KPIs of other teams and the DAO doesn\u2019t have a holistic framework for measuring KPIs at this time.   When we do our jobs well, we give people reasons to see value in MakerDAO and help them get the information they need to make decisions that better serve the DAO. In theory, that should translate into growth in areas like governance participation, opportunities for business development, and vault usage, but we can\u2019t meaningfully evaluate the performance of our content without a holistic view of KPIs it\u2019s not our place to take responsibility for. We\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019re happy to collaborate on a solution but as @twblack88 alluded to in this post, we\u2019re not in this alone and shouldn\u2019t be expected to solve the DAO\u2019s problems ourselves. @Recognized-Delegates  Explainer Videos Over the past month, our \u201cHow to Vote\u201d video, currently published in the Voting Portal and on Vimeo, has received:  566 Views 331 Unique Views Top 5 Regions: US, Netherlands, Argentina, Germany, Canada 480 Views from vote.makerdao.com   We\u2019re in the process of getting feedback on scripts and finishing animations on:  Gov Processes 1: Signal Requests and MIPs Gov Processes 2: Governance Polls & Executive Votes Liquidations   ETHDenver Video Content - Pre Production Progress The following content is planned for capture: Promotional video highlighting MakerDAO\u2019s presence at ETHDenver, including showcasing Growth and Content Production\u2019s respective events, sit-down interviews with the MakerDAO community and team members to be used for short documentaries and social media cutdowns, and hopefully interviews with members of other projects who work with Maker. Also, we will be gathering photographs across the event for social media.

The team has already provided Spanish subtitles for the \u201cHow to Vote\u201d explainer video and in addition to translating weekly polls, the Weekly Relay, State of Dai, and Multi-chain Dai-lights, the team is preparing Spanish translations of our MIPs and GovAlpha\u2019s Operational Manual.
