Mainly, the Wonka project/framework served as the main reference point, especially in terms of its technical design, due to Ethereum being paramount in its architectural goals.  (I mainly created Wonka to see if the idea was simply insane.  As it turns out, it\u2019s only half insane.)  However, reflecting now on my career, the culmination of Wonka was influenced to some degree by the various rules engines encountered over time (such as BizTalk, Tibco, Pega, etc.).  In fact, I think that it would be incredibly beneficial to the entire Ethereum ecosystem if bridges could be built between these existing enterprise systems (like BizTalk) and the blockchain.  That is, of course, a somewhat lofty goal, but I\u2019m enticed by such ideas. ",
