In fact, if we see how much USDC have been locked in the protocol, I would say that many believe it will go under 1.01 (otherwise, people would not keep locking USDC and probably leveraging risking big fees due to the 4% at these values) There are still ~200M more to mint from USDC and TUSD vaults. Enough that some whales get convinced of this fact, to use leverage in millions and bring the PEG very close to 1.00. If we see those 200M being minted, and still not big drops in the DAI/USDC price in open market, then that would be a stronger indicator to think that current settings are not enough, but TBH, more likely it\u2019ll be preferably to increase the debt ceiling for stablecoins then.
