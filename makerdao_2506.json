However, this seems unlikely, and not big enough of a risk to warrant disrupting the peg for. If we keep assets right at the debt ceiling limits, we will continue to have peg issues as there is not room enough for significant arbitrage efforts to make a difference. A lot of arbitrage opportunities require the confidence that the peg will be restored in time before the stability fee removes the potential profit. If that confidence isn\u2019t there, then less people are willing to participate. It creates a negative cycle. If there was enough of a debt ceiling available such that someone could come in, mint dai, and restore the peg tomorrow, it would create a positive cycle even if no one took advantage of it immediately. Certainly few rational actors would consider buying DAI at $1.02 in that scenario. ",
