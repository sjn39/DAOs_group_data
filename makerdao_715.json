                    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m sure this has been discussed before, but I couldn\u2019t find a full answer. Please link me to it if it\u2019s out there. I\u2019ve been wondering: if we assume that the burn mechanic is the only method that there will ever be for returning value to MKR holders, what\u2019s the ultimate point of holding MKR? I can think of a few arguments:   MKR tokens give you voting power. But why is this valuable?   You want to have a say in the mission of the protocol, e.g. \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d or \u201cclean money\u201d. But if we\u2019re focusing on only financial value, this doesn\u2019t provide any (directly).   If you control enough MKR, you can take over the protocol and give yourself all of the collateral. But this wouldn\u2019t happen, because someone would trigger Emergency Shutdown and/or vault owners would withdraw their collateral if they observed it happening. The threat of these two (hopefully) deters a \u201c51% attack\u201d reason for MKR tokens having value.   So let\u2019s set aside voting power as a reason for MKR having (financial) value.   Burning tokens increases the Earnings Per Share ratio.   But if there will never be a method for returning cold hard cash to holders (as opposed to buybacks), there\u2019s really never going to be any \u201cearnings\u201d distributions, so really the EPS is 0 (or, conversely, P/E ratio is infinity). On the other hand, imagine the price of MKR does somehow go up. The amount of MKR we are able to buy and burn with our earnings as the price increases will decrease asymptotically \u2014 eventually we\u2019ll literally just be burning our DAI for very little reduction in outstanding MKR supply / almost no increase in EPS.    Burning tokens increases buy-side pressure and so increases MKR price.   But the moment after we trade some DAI for MKR to burn, we are not worth more; we are worth the same, because we are down an equivalent amount of DAI. Here are a few articles on why buybacks only increase share price under specific circumstances:  The Dangers of Buybacks: Mitigating Common Pitfalls Do Share Buybacks Really Destroy Long-Term Value? Is a Share Buyback Right for Your Company?      The biggest reason buybacks have historically worked to increase share price is if management uses them wisely to signal to the market that the share price is undervalued.   But this would require us to:   Do large buybacks infrequently. From the last linked article above,  The materiality level shows, for different degrees of market mispricing, how large a buyback must be to have a significant effect on the share price. Small buybacks will have an effect only if the market heavily undervalues the shares. The common 5% buyback will hit the trigger materiality level of 5% only if the shares are trading at a 50% discount to their real value.    Not have a regular cadence for buybacks; instead we would have to agree (unlikely) on a model to price MKR, and then only do buybacks when the model indicates that we\u2019re undervalued AND we have sufficient cash on hand to do a buyback that\u2019s large enough to have an effect.       In summary, if there\u2019s not even a possibility of cold hard cash being distributed to MKR holders in the distant future, what gives MKR value? Don\u2019t we need some form of payout mechanism (even if we don\u2019t turn it on for years), whether it\u2019s dividend-style or sagittarius-engine-style or whatever? (I want to clarify that I\u2019m not opposed to burning; I think some amount of burning is essential because MakerDAO isn\u2019t an ordinary company and MKR tokens aren\u2019t ordinary shares. MKR is the collateral-of-last-resort. Since flops are a crucial component of the system, flaps must exist as a counter-balance. The goal of flaps should be to give investors confidence that even if flops occur, the number of outstanding tokens will eventually come back down below some number, as it did after Black Thursday.)

In summary, if there\u2019s not even a possibility of cold hard cash being distributed to MKR holders.   I think this part is more subtle and should be viewed from the MKR token holder\u2019s point of view. You have to ultimately sell your MKR to get the cold hard cash - you just get more if you hold MKR for longer. The protocol needs to buy MKR in order to burn it and that must come from MKR holders. So at least one MKR holder gets DAI, which comes from the protocol\u2019s earnings (stability fees minus protocol expenses). This is the part where an MKR holder gets cold hard cash. After such an event, there\u2019s less MKR supply out there and the next time out, protocol needs to obtain MKR from the holders at a slightly higher price. Hence, any MKR holder who exchanges their MKR for DAI in this round gets a little more DAI than the first guy. Obviously, there are macro market movements that affect the price wildly but the burn mechanism keeps applying this buy pressure in the background which is why it\u2019s worth holding MKR. The way this works is to drive the price of the token up and lets token holders decide when to realize those gains. ",

Distributing protocol earnings to MKR holders directly would lower the burn rate so it doesn\u2019t matter which mechanism you pick to transfer value. It is a zero sum game - all the protocol profits can only go to MKR holders one way or another. Of course, psychologically, people might react differently to a dividend-bearing token and that mechanism might be easier to understand. I wouldn\u2019t say the burn mechanism is that indirect or hard to understand though. Finally, there are also lots of benefits to not having payouts.

I\u2019m not convinced that it is a zero-sum game \u2014 different methods of payouts would seem to have different efficiencies (even apart from gas/tax). To my knowledge, Maker is one of the first experiments ever at solely having buybacks without any direct payout mechanism to provide a rationale for them. The articles I linked above suggest that even buybacks under different circumstances have different efficiencies at returning value to holders, so it\u2019s hard to imagine mechanisms as different as buybacks and dividends are completely equivalent.
