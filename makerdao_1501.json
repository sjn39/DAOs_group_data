                    "content": "The prospect of MKR issuance to recapitalize the system leads to decline in MKR price. Recapitalization is also likely to be needed when overall market sentiment is low. Basically the system is set up to buy high and sell low. Over time this could lead to excessive dilution of MKR holders and make MKR a less valuable asset, which diminishes its value as a system backstop. I\u2019m wondering how the mint/burn mechanics could be set up counter cyclically to avoid minting MKR at low prices? My first impression is to greatly increase the surplus threshold before excess DAI is auctioned for MKR, to allow the system to cover losses from reserves instead of new issuance. Is this a concern of anyone else? Any other prospective solutions or ideas to mitigate this? ",

That way during periods of drawdown we will have enough cash to cover the losses. Setting a high surplus threshold is important but not enough. Thats because institutional Dai demand grows as a function of system surplus. And if we rely solely on revenues to boost surplus it will take decades before MakerDAO is of global significance. Thats why I believe surplus threshold should be as high as possible with as much inflows of Dai from as many directions as possible. ",

System surplus of 0-50k DAI compared with 100MM DAI market cap is basically 0 reserves. It\u2019s as if a bank lent out 100% of deposits for mortgages that are 150% backed by real estate - if any single loan defaults, the bank becomes immediately insolvent.

                    "content": "One remark, At exacly same time when there was 5 mln of bad debt DAI was trading 0.06-0.1 $ above a peg. Maybe MakerDAO should have right to Issue \u201cEmpty DAI\u201d (and buy back MKR token for those DAI) to bring peg down and also responsibility to buy them back (minting MKR) when situation stabilize / DAI peg breaks down. I\u2019m aware that it play wit a concept of every single DAI being overcollateralized all the time, but there Is strange mismatch in current dynamics: Maker ecosystem is most useful for crypto people in the moment of market crash, providing safe harbour (DAI) but it do not benefit from that service it provides. Instead it takes a hit. What MakerDAO benefits from is providing leverage in good times, which, I would argue, Is neither main reason for its existence nor it biggest advantage/utility In other words there is a mismatch between source of revenue of MakerDAO and most useful services it provides to the market / risks it takes, such mismatch is never good for a system.
