Hopefully, we\u2019ll eventually see popular apps and payment processors dominating the space, in which case they will likely be a major driver of which chain gets preference, rather than exchanges via ticker symbols. In a perfect world we could have contentious forks just result in a community split where both communities are happy to plod along separately with slightly different rules but there is no animosity and no preference given for one or the other.

This is probably wishful thinking however. Another interesting thought is how the plasma paradigm could play into this. Could you link those networks together and sibling plasma chains somehow?

Here are some initiatives I support, which are related to this discussion:   Repeal and replace https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md What happens when an Ethereum-foundation-supported fork fails? We will have the old version and the new version with the same ID. This is an existential threat. At present, every time there is a contentious fork we need to change the rules. Last time, Ethereum Classic started and we created EIP-155. Next time there is a fork they will both use the same chain ID, again, and we\u2019ll need to scramble to fix it. Nobody is going to fork Ethereum and choose a new chain ID, everybody wants /their/ fork to be canonical. SOLUTION: do not use chain IDs, use genesis block IDs and make a new genesis block on each fork. I can write this up into a formal specification.   Immutability Enforcement Proposal, stop dicking around and accept it as draft, then debate it on merit. I\u2019m working with banks and government to record official records on blockchain. Remember that in most of the world Ether is an asset not a currency. The United States Food and Drug Administration does not care if you lost EVM-gas-utility-tokens (i.e. Ether) on a Parity wallet. The US FDA cares that records recorded on the blockchain will stay there.   Encourage alternate EVM implementations and improve the Yellow Paper so that it is actually implementable.   ",
