                    "content": "Sure. Currently all keeper actions are supported by Maker\u2019s internal tech-ops team. While they\u2019ve been doing a great job, it is a point of centralization and if a critical piece ever went down then it could be catastrophic. MIP63 is an effort to gradually decentralize this to include not only the internal tech-ops team, but also include Gelato, Keep3r Network as redundancies to make sure these critical functions always get executed. Currently we are in a trial phase, and so only 3 non-critical keeper actions have been added, but the idea is to eventually switch over to this entirely for system stability. Another benefit is more technical in that Protocol Engineering has a standard interface to add new keeper actions. Previously this required a back and forth with tech-ops, but can now be automatically added in to the list via executive. For the 1000 DAI / day, this is a stream rate, but will not be the cost. It is set high enough in case of gas spikes, but in reality the 20k max buffer will likely be filled and any excess is programmed to automatically return to the surplus buffer. Keep3r Network has been running services pro-bono for about a month now and they\u2019ve built a chart to show expenditure: Dune Analytics Their numbers show expenditure of around 1.48 ETH in that one month so we are talking around 4000 DAI / month in actual costs. Gelato will not be exactly the same, but this is the sort of ballpark we are talking. Tech-ops is currently working on more detailed charts so we can keep track of expenses on this more closely going forward. Keep3r Network will also be requesting a budget soon of probably around the same amount, and as we move more services from tech-ops only to this new decentralized system obviously the costs will increase. Tech-ops pays for their gas from their own budget so they don\u2019t need this. TLDR this is a beta phase, and it will likely cost under 10k / month (assuming gas prices are the same) for the whole thing even with another network onboarded. Does that cover all your questions?
