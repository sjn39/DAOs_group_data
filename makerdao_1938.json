This post covers:  PR efforts Marketing campaigns Social Media metrics (Twitter & LinkedIn) Learnings and ongoing initiatives for increasing the Maker brand awareness and strengthening the brand position.  To revisit previous Brand updates, please click the following links: August, July, June.   Spotlight:  The first IRL Maker ad! We placed a few ads in the El Dorado International Airport in Bogota to roll during DevCon. One of them was a rolling video strategically placed on a TV at the immigration check-in, where everyone flying in had exposure to it while standing in line. Our ads were recognized by many of the crypto community, and we have received plenty of Twitter mentions & positive feedback around it! Besides, thousands of non-crypto people were also exposed to it. This was a first-time test of IRL ads for our Brand team, which was very successful and taught us more about brand awareness, the knowledge that we will further use in the favor of growing Maker\u2019s exposure to the world.  image1184\u00d71186 124 KB   Dai a different Stablecoin Alongside with Bankless we published an article related to Dai and what makes it different, how it works and how it maintains its peg regarding being decentralized.

This behavior is normally expected given the Devcon event, and the market conditions, a parameter that is extremely linked to crypto social media activity. However, our engagement rate is stable. This is one of the most important metrics for us, as it explains what percentage of our audience interacts with our posts after giving us impressions. We noticed that posts with visual graphics tend to have better numbers than posts without. We\u2019re focusing more on visual graphics for future social media posts, with the aim of boosting our visual appeal and thus increasing our engagement. (We\u2019re expecting improved numbers for November according to this).   Top Tweets from September:  What are the risks of an Ethereum PoW chain after the Merge takes place?

After focusing a few sessions on finding out what Maker looks like now and what can we do better to represent its actual value and goals on the market, and in the world, we came up with better ideas on how to adjust the messaging and design - which will be implemented on the new version of the makerdao.com official website. Last week, we hired an external design & web development agency that will help us make these ideas come true. Our project starts this week and will take 3-4 months to complete.  As we explore what is best to be showcased on the official website, we will be working with mandated actors to help us by contributing their knowledge on each website section according to their mandate (eg. PE will help us on structuring some of the technical documentation, Oracles will contribute to the oracle section, etc.) In the final stages of the project, we will user-test different layouts and designs to ensure the new website ticks the right boxes.   Marketing campaign with Binance Pay On November 4th, we announced a campaign targeting Argentinian users in collaboration with Binance. All Binance users in Argentina who hold at least 10 DAI in their accounts could earn up to 1,009 DAI by ordering a Binance Card. Additionally, users will get a 5% cashback in DAI (token voucher) on top of the regular 8% cashback when spending with their Binance Card.  The campaign is ongoing and will last until November 30th. After that, we will use the campaign metrics to measure the effectiveness and get a better understanding of the usage of DAI on Binance. Every marketing campaign teaches us something new about crypto users, and that knowledge is further used to do better targeting and strategies in the future. Binance Card page.  We want to hear from you  Question of the month: What do you think the MakerDAO website is lacking the most at the moment? Share your thoughts, feedback, or tips with us in the comments below.

                    "content": "Hi @RoFz, thanks for your question! Let\u2019s start with some quick numbers: (#)Tweets:   October - 212 (October by tweet - Google Sheets)   September - 259 (September by tweet - Google Sheets)   August - 258 (August by tweet - Google Sheets)   July - 247 (July by tweet - Google Sheets)   We only slightly decreased October\u2019s tweet number compared to the previous month (-18% approximately). Now, let me give you more context after investigating more in what happened during those months: We had our best month in terms of impressions and engagement during July. In that month, we also had our single tweet with the most impressions and engagements. (https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1543998801786068992). Following the case of this tweet, the topic around our best-performing tweets during July and previous months was real-world finance and recent MakerDAO\u2019s RWA proposals. Given that context, we continued pushing tweets with this topic during the next months, but the attention decreased according to our impressions and engagements \u2014 it\u2019s hard to predict when a trend has ended or even if it has ended at all. In addition to that, October was a very particular month. We spent over 1 week tweeting about the Devcon event and Maker\u2019s participation. People tend to engage less with these kinds of tweets with self-promoting purposes, and a specific in-real-life event that most of our Twitter audience probably didn\u2019t attend. Still, we couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to talk about Maker\u2019s participation in Devcon because we had a big opportunity to gain a potential new audience for the long term. On top of that, the recent market conditions could have impacted our audience\u2019s activity on Crypto Twitter. When the market is flattening this is something that I\u2019d expect. Anyways, I\u2019m describing here potential cases I could identify, but there may be more situations that are off our radar and could affect our metrics, such as the Twitter algorithm\u2019s interest in boosting our tweets or the general Twitter level of activity during those specific months. However, I\u2019d like to highlight two important things:   Our engagement rate is high and growing, which is really important! That means an important share of our impressions is converted into engagements. That can represent our audience being more interested in sharing, reading, and linking our posts    Metrics improved in November! We just surpassed 1 million impressions during November and expect to close the month with a number between 1.3-1.5 million impressions, which is very close to our all-time high!    1600\u00d7691 169 KB  Lastly, social media is kinda dynamic, hard to predict in the short term. For that reason, and a broader, long-term branding improvement, our focus needs to be on the long term, and that is also why we are so focused on engagement rate. If we get more people to engage with our brand, it is more likely that they will be following our posts in the long run. The more people we have in the long run, the more our true community that wants to be with us grows! ",
