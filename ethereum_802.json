                    "content": "(written by @virgil)  Today I am in air transit with a yet undetermined schedule, so in the event I am unable to speak live on my introduction of the \u201cEIP OASIS plan\u201d, I have prepared these notes. My original proposal (approved by EF management) for an  experimental  EIP/ERC-approval process running  in parallel  to the existing EIP process is here: https://notes.ethereum.org/rkFOS_WLV  You can see the majority of the context there. Use of the experimental OASIS-EIP process is  entirely optional . If maintainers prefer, they can keep with the same system. If, after 18 months, it is deemed that the OASIS-EIP process isn\u2019t much better than our current one, we will  discontinue the experiment and return to single-process system we use now. If, after 18 months, it\u2019s determined that the OASIS-EIP process is a notable improvement, we can discuss making OASIS-EIP the sole EIP/ERC-approval process. After deciding that becoming an IETF working group would generate more problems than solutions, Ethereum Foundation decided to go with OASIS as OASIS is one of the few organizations that, rather than enforce gate-keeping (like IETF, ISO, etc), OASIS uses their standards specialists as shepherds and referees to bring out the best in your standards. Project Governing Board (PGB) Some have asked how the initial Project Governance Board was decided. I don\u2019t consider any of the picks to be controversial, but here\u2019s the reasoning for each initial member:  Ethereum Foundation - Would be bizarre to not have EF represented. I, Virgil Griffith, will be the initial EF representative, but I hope to abdicate this role as soon as possible. Consensys - With the exception of EF, Consensys employees have authored more EIPs than any other org. We wish to reward this behavior. Ethereum Enterprise Alliance - Although coming from the more corporate world, the EEA has a lot of standards experience and expertise. It seems sensible to leverage this experience. Additionally, having EEA more involved in Ethereum EIPs will improve their ability to keep their own EEA standards compatible and up to date with ours. Nick Johnson - Nick has been the primary steward of the EIP process for sometime. The goal is for him is to represent the values of the existing pre-OASIS process and overall be a voice of \u201cthe people\u201d within the PGB.  As there are an even number of PGB members, if there is a tie, OASIS referees will cast the tie-breaking vote. Technical Steering Committee (TSC) One pleasant change in this process is that, whereas the Magicians EIP Ring was before merely the unofficial custodian of the EIP process, in the OASIS process the EIP Ring becomes the Technical Steering Committee, which has official, specific powers. This enshrines the Magicians (or at least the EIP Ring) with official standing. I have complete confidence in the Magicians for rising to the challenge of wielding these new powers. The person to field all OASIS-related questions to is Jory Burson jory.burson@oasis-open.org. (this post was written by @virgil ) ",

The TSC and PGB may also want to set other criteria like \u201cmust have 2 independent implementations\u201d or \u201cmust have an open source reference implementation\u201d or \u201cmust have conformance criteria\u201d etc. We certainly don\u2019t want to exacerbate issues with the EIP process - and I\u2019d love to know what those are from your point of view, by the way - the current thinking is that we should pilot the process with something like JSON-RPC which isn\u2019t an EIP at all, and go from there. If it goes well, we do it again with a different piece of work, or we go back to the drawing board.

I will also not over-react to assertions about the Ethereum Magicians in  Hiring OASIS to referee the EIP process. What I will emphasize is that it is up to the Rings to adopt this framework. The Ethereum Foundation could not impose a standards framework on the core devs, nor could the Ethereum Magicians impose anything on the Rings, even in a Council. Having said this, I would encourage some Rings and individuals championing standards (and potential standards) to take a serious look at this program. Considering the cost and what is offered, I do appreciate this program. It can lead to much-needed learning, and likely will lead to higher quality EIPs.

We may value leadership however, and appreciate any way to improve discussions and decisions about Ethereum protocol and related technologies. It is in the leadership and quality of discussions from a potential TSC where we may find a lot of value. We should open this up and discuss how a TSC can be formed. The Editors may be a good place to start, and I know that @cdetrio has discussed/proposed something along the lines of a TSC in recent years.

It\u2019s the weakest area of specs, and biggest area for re-use and collaboration, and also non-controversial. I would also suggest that each such area has a separate TSC. Which I don\u2019t know how that meshes with the OASIS process. I started also using JSON-RPC as a starting point 5 months ago. Existing repo is here https://github.com/spadebuilders/ethereum-json-rpc-spec I think re-gathering interested parties \u2014 EEA, wallets & other middleware, client implementors \u2014 would be good. Lastly \u2014 I don\u2019t think the process maps to EIPs overall. Some EIPs are pointers to large chunks of work like the JSON-RPC spec, others are smaller and self contained. Hope that helps!

I\u2019ll underscore that this is all really in a \u2018discovery\u2019 stage, and one of the differentiators for OASIS as a standards org is that its process can be flexible in a lot of places. So getting to know the existing Ethereum processes, what works, what\u2019s analogous to OASIS process, etc\u2026 that\u2019s our goal at the moment.     boris:  These are already gates within the EIP process on the way to network deployment.   @boris I think I missed this studying the EIP process overview; can you point me to where this & other \u2018gates\u2019 might be documented so I can get an accurate picture? Are there requirements for some components but not others, for example? TY!     boris:  I would also suggest that each such area has a separate TSC.

Some  EIPs are pointers to large chunks of work like the JSON-RPC spec, others are smaller and self contained.  I don\u2019t know much yet, but I think you may be right. Chatting with Virgil earlier, we think the comparison to EIPs and the EIP process was perhaps pre-mature. Perhaps reframing it as an \u2018Open Standards Project\u2019 makes it less muddy? Boris, A Jones, Jamie - I don\u2019t want to ask too much of ya\u2019ll\u2019s time, but it would be super helpful if we could \u2018interview\u2019 you on a zoom chat or something?
