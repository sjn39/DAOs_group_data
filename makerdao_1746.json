As such and to ensure transparency and accountability with the Maker community, we\u2019ll plan to jointly release weekly updates pertaining to deal progress. One important feature to highlight for the Maker community: Blocktower and ourselves intend to further develop the on-chain aspects of the transaction. BlockTower is working with Centrifuge and the MIP22 Centrifuge adapter. See below for a prospective deal timeline (subject to further refinement with BlockTower, Centrifuge, CES and ourselves on MIP22 technical alignment with the transaction terms):  1540\u00d7978 261 KB  Highlights of this week:  Kickoff call between Blocktower and MakerDAO BT prepared an initial term sheet and we provided initial comments BT prepared and circulated a high-level legal/transactional structure External counsel established and/or identified by both sides First in-person meeting between Blocktower and MakerDAO NDAs executed and Blocktower asset pipeline/data room shared Asset pipeline review has commenced CES requested to commence review of MIP22 and Centrifuge adapter  The first week of a Maker deal is about level setting. Context for engagement should be established, the borrower\u2019s ask and motivation should be detailed, and a tentative timeline and deal schedule should be agreed upon bilaterally. Both sides should be able to reasonably and honestly convey their motivations for approaching the deal table. Teej visited the Blocktower offices and spoke with management about the fund\u2019s operations + credit/underwriting infrastructure, motivation for pursuing this facility with Maker, as well as Blocktower\u2019s firm-level thesis on the tradeoffs to tokenizing RWAs (with particular concentration on Maker + Centrifuge). Though early, our initial review of the pipeline and intended portfolio construction has provided valuable insight into BTCR\u2019s intended strategy. It is critical to understand what BTCR\u2019s edge is and how they\u2019ll deploy in a responsible manner that drives strong risk-adjusted returns. ",

BlockTower intends to utilize the Tinlake smart contract protocol developed by Centrifuge. BlockTower has procured a more comprehensive HVB-like term sheet. @christiancdpetersen and @teej are evaluating the term sheet while progressing through the legal + commercial evaluation in parallel. Finally, service providers have been identified. Highlights   BlockTower circulated detailed term-sheet: inclusive of not only basic structural terms like rate, leverage, purchase commitment, draw schedule, but also more granular provisions and mechanics  Legal structure revised: The Tinlake smart contract protocol, MIP22, and a deeper technical understanding of the Tinlake functions has yielded potential opportunities to rely on code for certain operational functions. BlockTower and @christiancdpetersen are working closely with Centrifuge to assess these opportunities and refine the legal structure accordingly.  Covenants improved: Christian and Teej improved the vault-specific as well as portfolio-wide triggers and covenants  Transaction flow refined: Parties have, at a high level, finalized the basic transaction flow from real world origination all the way through to the minting of DAI against DROP tokens.  Service providers finalized: Calculation/verification agent, paying agent, and servicing party confirmed.  Risk evaluation in motion: The commercial and legal risk evaluation has commenced.  Coordination with CES BlockTower and @christiancdpetersen and @teej are coordinating with @collateral-core-unit on the technical implementation.  With a nearly fully-baked Blocktower term sheet, we can go ahead and make progress on the risk evaluation. Although some commercial terms have not yet been agreed upon, having the basic structural skeleton of the deal, as well as other key terms, allows for material analysis. Christian and Teej worked to improve and tighten a variety of covenants on the facility. Such refinements include conditional cross-collateralization, interest coverage triggers, portfolio-wide and vault-specific events of defaults, and a verity of others. The suite of service providers has been confirmed, barring any material information changes. Ankura will serve as calculation agent, paying agent, and trustee for this transaction. Because BlockTower can interface directly with the protocol and borrow denominated in DAI, an exchange agent will probably not be necessary. BlockTower will service the loans. Teej has begun drafting the commercial risk assessment. @BlockTower ",

Our hope is that this work, for which we\u2019ve borne a significant cost, can be used for future RWA transactions going forward in an efficient and repeatable way. The deeper we\u2019ve gone, the more apparent that comparing this transaction to the real world is comparing apples with oranges. Not to mention that, unlike every transaction before us, we\u2019ve seriously upped the ante (both in terms of return but also including junior capital at risk, structural alignment with the Maker protocol through token ownership, and engagement with governance and the community). In any case, you know the door is always open to discuss these issues and differences. Thanks for your time, @Eumenes ! ",

Though it has certainly is an improvement versus some earlier ones\u2026 MKR holders need to compare these significant negatives with the positive innovation features in the transaction and decide accordingly. I hope Teej carefully lays out the TradFi market terms for senior back leverage for a private credit fund -  which is a good base comparison to this transaction.

Learning from the HVB process, both sides have pursued an exhaustive term sheet that has allowed for the simultaneous drafting of a commercial risk evaluation, which is nearing conclusion, and the transaction agreements. If approved, this deal will represent the most natively on-chain RWA onboarding to date. Given the frontier nature of the transaction, which we expect to be a standard for following deals, the transaction agreements and structural arrangements were not always intuitive. Such is the frontiersman tax. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made and the light at the end of the tunnel is visible.

And will TACO be composed of a community committee,  and/or outside actors? Does the Loan Verification Agent (Ankura) have experience with confirming if Tinlake NFTs (Participated Credit) are eligible? I imagine Centrifuge has previously used their services. Minimum Tin Percentage: With regards to reducing the minimum TIN by 10%, Who determines if the \u201cFirst Loss Position\u201d is mark-to-market of the Participated Credit? I imagine Ankura verifies that the \u201cParticipated Credit\u201d is mark-to-market? Wondering how the value of the asset at hand is assessed. Reporting: Is there an Auditor to audit the Settlement & Portfolio Health Report? And do you consider Ankura as the equivalent of a \u201cback-up servicer\u201d that can ensure cash collections (for lack of a better word) from the exposure pools and a back-up servicer that can maker sure subsequent distributions of interest and principal repayments continue without interruption? Maximum Non-US/Canadian Exposure: Is it 20% to 25%, or 16.67% as stated in Addendum 1?

Ankara will be responsible to confirm that the assets meet the eligibility criteria. Further, as trustee under the indenture, Ankura will be the independent, third party responsible for engaging with the Issuer(s).     flipflopflapdelegate:  And will TACO be composed of a community committee, and/or outside actors?   TACO will have an independent director.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Does the Loan Verification Agent (Ankura) have experience with confirming if Tinlake NFTs (Participated Credit) are eligible?   I do not know if they have experience with Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake process. However, their role as verification agent is important as they provide the independent, third-party check on the inputs that form the basis of the NFTs. Ankura is already providing a similar role in HVB (but HVB does not involve NFTs).     flipflopflapdelegate:  With regards to reducing the minimum TIN by 10%, Who determines if the \u201cFirst Loss Position\u201d is mark-to-market of the Participated Credit?

Let me come back to you on this point. I believe that part of the answer may be in the mechanics of the Tinlake protocol itself (but I could be totally wrong too). @elidco and @humancapitol for further discussion.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Is there an Auditor to audit the Settlement & Portfolio Health Report?   No.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And do you consider Ankura as the equivalent of a \u201cback-up servicer\u201d that can ensure cash collections (for lack of a better word) from the exposure pools and a back-up servicer that can maker sure subsequent distributions of interest and principal repayments continue without interruption?   No. Ankura is not the back-up servicer (which role would be more active than a trustee). Ankura is the independent, third-party engaged to manage certain aspects of the transaction. As trustee, Ankura might be expected to approve the appointment of a back-up servicer, but not act as the back-up servicer.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Maximum Non-US/Canadian Exposure: Is it 20% to 25%, or 16.67% as stated in Addendum 1?   The 20% and 25% refer to the Minimum TIN Percentage.

We did so in order to mitigate liquidity and interest rate risk. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure. Eliminate Non-US/Non-Canada Jurisdictional Exposure: BlockTower cannot originate assets outside of the US or Canada. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure. Add Structured Credit Products to Eligible Collateral: Due to recent changes in market conditions, it has become accretive for BlockTower to buy investment grade asset-backed securities alongside the origination of assets directly. BlockTower will utilize one of its four vaults for purchase of such bonds. Bonds are highly liquid, diversified exposures with proven statistical performance. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure. Removed Non-BT Junior Risk Holders: Whereas previously BlockTower could share the 30% first loss with external funds or originators, BlockTower is now required to retain the entirety itself. This materially improves the risk profile of Maker\u2019s exposure. No direct oil & gas investments: No explanation needed. Four Vaults not Five Vaults: Due to the addition of structured credit products to the eligible collateral base, BlockTower will use four instead of five vaults. The updated term sheet is Here. @teej and I met with BlockTower on Monday and Tuesday of this past week to review 1st drafts of all of the proposed finance agreements.
