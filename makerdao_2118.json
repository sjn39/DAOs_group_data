During this reporting period, we financed 12 Structured Credit assets within the Consumer and Marketplace Lending, Solar, and Small Business Lending sectors with commerical ratings above BBB- and totaling over $60M in value. Importantly, these investments demonstrate the viability and potential of leveraging Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake platform and Ankura as indenture trustee to onboard RWA collateral in a transparent and verifiable manner. Looking forward, we\u2019re excited to continue bringing high quality RWAs for the Maker community and reporting on the results!
