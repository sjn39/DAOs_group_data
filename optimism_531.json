Despite its speedy functionality as a Layer-2 marketplace, Zonic still maintains a high level of security. Our main focus is not just to provide a high-quality NFT marketplace, but also to support NFT creators in the ecosystem with various tools, such as a sale bot, launchpad, NFT generator, and more. Our ultimate goal is to promote sustainable growth in the NFT ecosystem on L2. Zonic has been built entirely from scratch without using any open-source marketplace software. Every single line of code has been written by @nuuneoi, the founder of the Apetimism NFT project, starting from December 2022. Rather than submitting proposals in the early day, we wanted to demonstrate the value of our product through its launch. Now that the marketplace is live, we believe it\u2019s the right time to propose some growth hacks that will benefit everyone in the ecosystem. Apetimism has been an NFT project on Optimism since its early days and is still active now. Apetimism is now ranked #2 among NFT projects on Optimism in terms of market capitalization, trailing only Optimism Quests.  Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:  Business Reason: Our team has been actively involved in the NFT space for more than three years, serving in diverse roles such as trader, artist, creator, and currently as a builder. Through our interactions with a wide range of individuals, we have gained valuable insights into the pain points experienced by each player in the ecosystem. Our objective is not limited to establishing a platform for NFT trading, but also to provide tools that can assist every participant in the ecosystem in addressing their challenges and achieving their goals to fulfill what is about to happen in the next era of NFT space. Moreover, our team possesses extensive expertise in product development, as we have built the entire stack from scratch ourselves. Technical Reason: Our products have been entirely developed from scratch, providing them with limitless potential for expansion. While there are various white-label NFT marketplace systems available that enable the creation of an NFT marketplace in just a matter of days, we chose to develop everything ourselves and not rely on any third-party products. This is because we aspire to create not just an NFT marketplace, but much more beyond it. Thanks to our current product architecture, we strongly believe that we have the capability to extend our services to virtually anything we desire, which instills a high level of confidence in our product.  How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:  At present, our Quests system is being used by 54,000 distinct addresses, while approximately 4,400 unique addresses are engaging in NFT trading. All by the organic growth.  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism:  The NFT sector on the Optimism ecosystem is still relatively immature. (It\u2019s worth noting that Zonic is the same team as Apetimism, which was one of the early NFT projects on the ecosystem, so we have observed almost everything in this field.) Through our three years of experience in the NFT space across various chains, we have realized the potential for genuine adoption and growth in this area, driven by practical use cases instead of mere speculation. Hundreds of thousands of new users will be driven to Optimism by this space alone once it is more mature. However we must admit to one fact about the NFT ecosystem on Optimism: the activity and trading volume are still very low and totally incomparable to what they are on L1. The current situation is akin to a chicken-and-egg problem: we cannot expect trading activity to increase without a high-quality marketplace, but we also cannot expect an NFT marketplace to survive with such low trading volume, as the main revenue of this business comes from a percentage of the trading volume. To solve the problem, \u201cActivation Energy\u201d and \u201cCatalysts\u201d are required to jump-start NFT trading activity and boost the overall NFT ecosystem on Optimism to prepare for the next bull run. This is the reason why we are applying for the grant; to boost the activity and ignite the market in the early stage. Once everything settles down, the Optimism NFT ecosystem will continue to grow without further incentives.  Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.:  NFT owners and gamers. NFT is now a pretty standard media being broadly used by general web3 users. If we can create the NFT scene on Optimism, that basically means that we can attract NFT users from the overall web3 space to Optimism. We also target the gamer since we predict the next era of NFT will be about gaming. The products we are about to deliver are also related to this space. Anyway, we will not deliver the game ourselves but more like the tools to attract the builder to create the game on Optimism.  How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?:  In the present NFT era, ownership, use as a profile picture, and trading are the primary use cases. Retention may be low in this scenario, as evidenced by decreased interest during bear markets. However, from our viewpoint, the next era of NFTs will be more akin to \u201ccollectibles,\u201d providing users with a feeling of ownership. Coupled with use cases in gaming systems, people will remain engaged and use them for extended periods regardless of market conditions. We need to build the infrastructure beforehand to make the entire space know that Optimism is ready for this.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  The Zonic Marketplace launched on February 2023, featuring two main products: the Zonic NFT Marketplace and Zonic Quests, which has been built on top of the marketplace business to support growth. Here are the usage metrics for the past month since we launched.   The total trading volume to date is 168.2608 ETH, with 134.1846 ETH of that occurring on Optimism.  There have been 7,224 trades to date, with 4,033 of those happening on Optimism. 53,607 unique addresses registered in the system. 5,000 daily Zonic Quests participants. 6,000 daily quests completed daily. 10,000 daily pageview by average. 3 minutes average engagement time on site.

Public Dashboard could be found here: Insights | Zonic : NFT Marketplace for L2  Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:  Quix, OpenSea, TofuNFT   Team Who are your founders?:  Zonic NFT Marketplace has been found by Sittiphol Phanvilai (@nuuneoi), the founder of the Apetimism NFT project, starting from December 2022. Sittiphol is an ex-Meta and a serial entrepreneur who has sold 4 of his companies so far.  What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal?  As mentioned above, our team not only understands the pain point of each player in the space but also has great knowledge and capability to build a real product to solve those problems. Everything being proposed in this proposal is not just a dream but 100% achievable.  Is this your first Web3 project?:  It is about the 5th, but most of them were private projects and can\u2019t be disclosed due to NDA.  If not, what else have you built?  Apetimism (https://apetimism.com, https://twitter.com/apetimism, Apetimism) \u2013 one of the very first NFT projects on Optimism, and it is now the only few that is still actively working on building stuff on Optimism.   Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 150,000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?:  Currently, we have two ways to reward users for their actions through Zonic NFT marketplace. 1) Marketplace Fee Cashback - The current marketplace fee on the platform is 2.5%. Our plan is to give traders a 40% rebate on that fee, which is equivalent to 1% of the total fee, in the form of OP only for the trade that happens on Optimism. This incentive is designed to encourage more trading activity. Moreover, since Zonic supports multiple L2 blockchains, this cashback program can also help attract users from other L2 blockchains to Optimism. 2) Zonic Quests Gift Boxes Reward - We also have Zonic Quests, a user-to-earn program that is built on top of our marketplace business. This program is designed to reward users for their activities on our platform that supports the growth of both our business and the ecosystem, such as:   GM: Users can earn points for checking the NFT marketplace every day.  Daily Trade Activity: Users can earn points in proportion to their daily trading volume.  Artist Support: The user can earn extra points by trading NFT for the specific collection to support the artist.  etc.: We intend to add more quests along the way with the goal of \u2018boosting meaningful activity with every OP spent\u2019. If the proposal is approved, we will create Optimism-specific quests that will provide more points to those who trade on Optimism as opposed to competitors.  Once users have collected enough points, they can redeem them for a gift box, which can be burned for a chance to win a various range of actual prizes from NFT to some amount of ETH or OP tokens. The Zonic Quests system is well-designed to prevent the creation of Sybil accounts. We only reward users for meaningful activities that contribute to our goal of sustainable growth. On average, it takes a genuine user around 10 days to collect enough points for one Gift Box, while it would take a Sybil account around 40 days to achieve the same. We have also established a criterion to prevent Sybil attacks by limiting reward claims to addresses with at least 0.1 ETH of total trading volume. Zonic Quests is currently in Season 1, and it has already been a great success, with 5,000 users participating in the quests every single day. We strongly believe that the OP incentives, in the form of the Marketplace Fee Cashback and Zonic Quests Gift Box program, will result in significant and meaningful growth for the Optimism ecosystem. 150,000 OP requested is justified by the following:   10% to Cashback Reward program - Based on our calculations, we conservatively estimate a daily trading volume of 20 ETH on Optimism, which would result in cashback rewards of approximately 120 OP per day. We plan to run the campaign for three consecutive months, distributing a total of 16,000 OP as cashback rewards over that period or until the fund runs out.   90% to Gift Box Reward program - Zonic Quests plays a vital role in promoting actual activity through our reward program. Therefore, we plan to allocate the majority of our OP rewards to this section. We plan to reward a total of 30,350 Zonic Gift Boxes over six months period with the distribution of the OP reward listed below.  Screen Shot 2566-03-07 at 16.16.41864\u00d7386 23.4 KB  The majority of gift boxes will include a 2 OP reward, which covers the actual gas cost that the user needs to pay to complete the quest and acquire one box, based on our calculations. Additionally, users will have a 33.33% chance of receiving an even greater reward, which is intended to generate more excitement and encourage further participation in the quests, resulting in higher activity on Optimism.     Roadmap and Distribution Plan  How will the OP tokens be distributed?  100% of the grant will be used as a user reward. Please refer to the section above for more details. It\u2019s essential to mention that we recognize the \u201cOP Reward Hunt\u201d trend, where individuals create Sybil accounts to hunt the OP and contribute nothing beneficial to the ecosystem. As a result, we have devised a system that rewards users who make a trade of at least 0.05 ETH on Zonic, which is unlikely for most Sybil accounts to accomplish. Consequently, we can anticipate that each OP rewarded in the campaign is in return for meaningful activity on the chain.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:  3 months  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Over the next three months, once the incentive ends, we expect the following metrics:  50,000 unique active addresses engaging in NFT trading on Optimism 100,000 Zonic Quest participants Once the campaign ends, 50,000 new addresses must hold at least one NFT in their wallets. Over 2,500 ETH in total trading volume on Optimism 50 ETH in creator fees paid to NFT creators on Optimism   Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  We have established clear criteria for reward redemption, whereby active users can claim a Gift Box once every ten days, and there are a total of 30,350 Gift Boxes to be claimed during the campaign. If the number of Gift Boxes claimed falls short of the milestone, it will not be achieved. In the event that any Gift Boxes remain unclaimed at the end of the campaign, we will distribute the reward proportionally and return any remaining unclaimed OP tokens to the Optimism Foundation. We regard OP grants not as a form of charity, but rather as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) to attract and retain individuals who can generate life-time value (LTV) for the entire ecosystem.  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?:  According to the \u2018Activation Energy\u2019 theory, once sufficient energy is introduced to a chemical instance, the reaction will generate energy and continue on by itself, further and beyond, without the need for additional energy. We have the same sense with the NFT ecosystem here on Optimism. After we make sufficient efforts to boost meaningful activity on Optimism, the ecosystem will continue to grow on its own, even after the incentives dry up. Once the campaign ends, we expect at least one hundred thousand addresses to actively trade NFTs on Optimism, each of which will hold some NFTs. The sense of owning a token will encourage them to trade and provide intrinsic value to the NFTs, allowing the ecosystem to continue growing independently.  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.):   Zonic Marketplace Smart Contract    Optimism Relationship  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:  As previously mentioned, the NFT ecosystem on Optimism is still in its early stages. The demand is currently low, making it difficult to attract artists to work on NFTs on Optimism because they face challenges selling their work. Therefore, we need to increase the level of activity on the chain to make the market more appealing to them. That is why the Zonic project was launched in early December 2022, with the objective of supporting the growth of the NFT ecosystem and overall network adoption. Our aim is not limited to being just an NFT marketplace, but to provide the multiple services that support and boost the activities of all players in the ecosystem, including creators, artists, traders, and others. One of the services we offer is an NFT marketplace, which plays a crucial role in the NFT ecosystem. NFTs derive their intrinsic value from trading in the marketplace, so without a high-quality and highly liquid marketplace, growth in the NFT ecosystem is unlikely. We firmly believe that owning an NFT marketplace will be instrumental in driving demand for the NFT ecosystem on Optimism. We plan to use it as a core component to collaborate with artists and meaningfully drive the ecosystem forward. Now that our product is launched and ready, we are submitting this proposal to request support from the OP Governance in the form of an incentive that we believe would serve as an Activation Energy, significantly boosting the NFT scene on Optimism in both the short and long term.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:  Having NFT ecosystem mature on Optimism is crucial since it would bring a drastic amount of new users flowing into the Optimism ecosystem. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve devised a method to incentivize users through a series of activities that rewards them for actions that promote a range of NFT-related activities on Optimism. The baseline mindset here is:  Every OP incentive should lead to a meaningful and lasting impact on Optimism, rather than being a one-time event. It\u2019s not just about attracting users, but also about creating an environment where they are incentivized to stay for the long term.  As the campaign draws to a close, our goal is not only to witness increased NFT trading on Optimism but also to facilitate the creation of innovative solutions on top of NFT on Optimism by providing users with accessible tools.  Is your project Optimism Native?:  No.   Confirmations  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes  Appendix 1) Our vision on the Growth Experiment OP grant Contrary to popular belief, the Growth Experiment OP Grant is not free money for the team. Instead, each OP must be utilized to create a long-lasting impact on the Optimism ecosystem, as introduced by the builder behind the experiment. Our fundamental approach is to use the granted OPs in a manner that supports the sustainable growth of the ecosystem by rewarding users who undertake meaningful activities on the network. 2) Sybil must not be rewarded Sybil accounts do not engage in any meaningful activities and, in fact, can harm the ecosystem. Consequently, our campaign has been designed to exclude any rewards for Sybil accounts. To ensure this, we have implemented a mechanic where rewards can only be claimed by addresses with a trading volume of at least 0.1 ETH, which most Sybil accounts are unlikely to meet. Furthermore, we will introduce additional mechanics to ensure that Sybil accounts do not receive any benefits from the OP rewards. 3) What if the campaign failed In the event that the traffic falls short of our expectations, such as when only 10,000 Gift Boxes out of 30,000 are claimed, we will distribute the OP rewards in proportion to the actual traffic and return any remaining OP to the Optimism Foundation for other growth experiments. However, if the campaign yields positive results and demonstrates significant growth potential, we will propose a suitable scale to the committee and community for their decision on whether to extend the experiment.

I don\u2019t want this project to rely on one person alone, and I\u2019m eager to expand our team. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not backed by any VC, so we lack the funds to hire another team member at the moment. We had initially planned to set aside some funding for team growth. However, a new rule has been introduced that prevents us from doing so. Nonetheless, the proposal above could benefit our business and potentially generate some profit along with the growth of the overall ecosystem, which could allow us to add 3-4 new team members in the coming months. While the profit may not be substantial, it should be enough to achieve our goal of expanding the team. Considering the amount of OP to be distributed over a 6-month period, it may seem like a large number. However, we welcome any comments, feedback, or suggestions on this matter. We are open to adjusting either the reward amount or the timeframe, as our primary goal is to use this opportunity to enhance the entire NFT ecosystem on Optimism. If we receive any OP, it will all be used to reward our users, and none of it will be kept for personal gain. Everyone\u2019s input here is valuable to us. We would love to hear your comments! ",

Also one more thing about the volume of the current marketplace that was just launched. I noticed an insanely high amount of sales on collections which we have set at zero percent royalties on the Zonic marketplace. When I did further research it appears that close to $5,000 usd in volume is from wash  trade activity. According to the initial launch of the platform there is some sort of competition to raise volume on the market in order to qualify. This results in artificial numbers and volume being made for the submission of the proposal. This is not accurate information based from the on chain analytics I discovered. Falsified or fabricated information  on a grant proposal to spoof marketplace volume is not the best way to qualify for a grant in my opinion.

The total trading volume on the entire Optimism network is super low, mainly due to the small number of collections available. In fact, it seems that 90% of the collection owners have already rugpulled their projects, leaving only a few remaining. Most of the users who were previously on L2 have moved back to L1 because of this. Given the current scarcity of NFT collections and trading volume on Optimism, it is highly unlikely that a new marketplace will attract users unless they are incentivized to do so. This is why a trading competition program has been launched to boost activity. Although wash trading is not what we desire, it is not surprising to us. It is a part of the Activation Energy as explained in the proposal. In reality, every marketplace must surpass this point, including Opensea or Blur, for true adoption to occur. That is my two cents. One thing that we can assure you is that less than 0.1 ETH of the trading volume on Zonic to date is from us. The rest comes from real users, including wash traders who still pay real fees and generate actual trading activity on the platform. The statistics provided are genuine, and they demonstrate the actual outcome of the work we\u2019ve put into our Quests product. These results will contribute to increasing real user activity towards actual adoption, as mentioned in the proposal above. I understand your concerns, but that is precisely why we are making this proposal - to increase NFT activity on Optimism. Without these efforts, few people would move to Optimism, as the ecosystem is not yet fully developed. In fact, some may even move away from it. ",

Similar to the way that artificial volume is created on layer one to create hype and attract more users. This gambling model becomes unsustainable after the initial push of volume and most users become exit liquidity in what can no longer sustain such a high value. The fees of Zonic do not benefit anyone but the marketplace at the time of a sale and the artist is not receiving any sort of benefit from having their artwork on your platform if the royalties are all automatically set to zero. This feels like a double negative standard as opposed to the other way around where it would be beneficial for all parties or considered for public goods. ",

Running an NFT marketplace is not only challenging, but it also requires a significant amount of money to maintain the service. We do not expect to make a large profit, as it is already difficult to survive as an NFT marketplace business, especially one that is specifically created for Layer-2 due to its low volume.

Organic growth experiments are not intended to have any sort of manufactured or artificial volume to increase statistics. Nor should that all of a sudden qualify a project for the thresholds of a grant application. This is what is called price manipulation. The false narrative that is created with overvalued floor prices is a dangerous mechanism to lead less informed individuals into purchasing the project because they believe there is an opportunity to sell something they purchase off of the floor for an extremely high ROI which is not true. Also known as a bull trap. This type of behavior should never be what creates the catalyst behind the creation of any sort of speculative event that you are mentioning when talking about an upcoming bull run. This is leading to a very slippery slope very quickly. Incentive rewards should be based on the impact an individual makes in the ecosystem without ever having to fabricate any data. I am all in for supporting the Zonic marketplace and feel that it is more than necessary to have multiple NFT marketplaces on Optimism network.

While we are committed to not supporting wash trading, we also recognize that it is a necessary part of the growth experiment. Opensea, Blur, Lookrare, and X2Y2 all had to pass through this phase, which enabled them to grow sustainably to where they are today. However, they did not experience this phase on L2, which has left L2 comparatively underdeveloped. Even if we claim that we won\u2019t engage in wash trading, it is inevitable that it will occur. Every new marketplace goes through this phase, but the data collected from these experiences will help the ecosystem understand the best path forward. We have carefully considered our proposal to achieve the goals from both a visionary and practical perspective. We believe that we know what we\u2019re doing, but we need to run a series of experiments to boost the growth of the overall ecosystem. If you take a look at the current state of the NFT marketplace, you can see that the market is suffering due to the conflict between Blur and Opensea. Small NFT marketplaces cannot afford to run these experiments. We are perfectly fine if the committees do not accept our idea, as our goal is to use the funding to boost the NFT ecosystem on Optimism in the long run. If they do not agree with our proposal and the experiments we plan to run, and deem it not worth the OP funding, we will accept their decision without any problems. We see this as a mutually beneficial business deal. If the OP side does not see how it benefits them, then the deal will not happen. However, if they do, we will spend the OP funding wisely to support growth. In conclusion, we believe that funding for a \u201cGrowth Experiment\u201d is precisely what is needed at this time. ",

I am now wondering if any of the volume is organic or if it is purely artificial. This method does not entail the purchases were authentic NFT purchases and the only reason wash trading occurred was to receive the gift boxes but there was no sybil resistance in place. Here is the concern.   Wash trading allows the gamification of OP token rewards distribution and does not ensure the distribution is made to new users of the network due to sybil attacks.   Artificial volume occurring appears to be primarily from wash trades encouraging users to gain ZONIC rewards once again without any sort of system set in place to protect from sybil attacks.   Wash trading and allowing the creation of alternate accounts to receive funds from a rewards program does not ensure the tokens will not be misappropriated.   It would be easy for a member of the team to disguise themselves as a wash trader in order to receive part of the grant indirectly to avoid the no sale rule. ",

An incentive program for NFT buyers may refer to a marketing strategy that encourages or rewards buyers for purchasing ,holding NFTs or continuously use Zonic everyday. These programs can be used by NFT creators, platforms, or other stakeholders to incentivize demand for their digital assets. As you said many people try to trade NFT on their own.That because they want to done a Zonic Quest (One time Quest, Daily Quest) and this is a lowest cost option. But don\u2019t forget that They have to pay a 2.5% fee to Zonic marketplace. This means that the volumes in question, which are generated from the trading of NFTs, are a result of the incentive program. And Zonic returns this collected fees back to users as rewards in Zonic gift boxes. Zonic have certain conditions to prevent sybil attacks. \u2022 Number of days to be used continuously for sybil attacks more 40Day++ than regular user \u2022 Daily Quest cost 2.5% Fee in Trade quest type \u2022 This does not include the gas you have to pay every day. \u2022 I\u2019m sure the conditions will be even more difficult. Another thing is Zonic build up with solo developer @nuuneoi I saw his efforts to build a good Community and Economy on Optimism.I hope you guys will give Zonic a chance to try. ",

Please be sure to monitor it for updates over the course of the review period. At this stage, applications are mainly being reviewed for completeness, and nothing at this stage should be construed as support or opposition by any members of the Grants Council.     nuuneoi:  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Over the next three months, once the incentive ends, we expect the following metrics:  50,000 unique active addresses engaging in NFT trading on Optimism 100,000 Zonic Quest participants Once the campaign ends, 50,000 new addresses must hold at least one NFT in their wallets. Over 2,500 ETH in total trading volume on Optimism 50 ETH in creator fees paid to NFT creators on Optimism   Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  We have established clear criteria for reward redemption, whereby active users can claim a Gift Box once every ten days, and there are a total of 30,350 Gift Boxes to be claimed during the campaign. If the number of Gift Boxes claimed falls short of the milestone, it will not be achieved. In the event that any Gift Boxes remain unclaimed at the end of the campaign, we will distribute the reward proportionally and return any remaining unclaimed OP tokens to the Optimism Foundation. We regard OP grants not as a form of charity, but rather as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) to attract and retain individuals who can generate life-time value (LTV) for the entire ecosystem.    We recommend as much specificity as possible, as the community will judge the effectiveness of the grant plan on its ability to deliver on these. Including timeframes to achieve milestones is important, and will be very helpful in judging these. ",
