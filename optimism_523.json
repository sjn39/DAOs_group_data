In a vast majority of cases, the targeted projects are already successful in crypto and looking at deploying and/or scaling on Optimism. The partners that apply for a grant are reviewed by the Foundation. Partner Fund grants are negotiated on a one-by-one basis and support the overarching goal to build a thriving ecosystem for developers. Areas of work include Defi, NFTs, DAOs as well as large scale usage growth for the ecosystem. Grants are structured in one of two ways:   User incentives: Grants are directly distributed to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem (e.g., liquidity mining, rewards\u2026)  Project Grant: These grants have a 1 year token lockup, after which point they may used to support operational costs.  The Foundation receives a large number of applications and is only able to support a select few that align with its objectives. To apply:   Fill out this form if you applied to the Governance Fund and were not reviewed or accepted Send an email to partnerships@optimism.io in the case of a new inquiry (did not apply through the Governance Fund)  ",
