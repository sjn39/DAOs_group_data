                    "content": "Fellow DAOists  The past few weeks have been very interesting at MakerDAO\u2014we\u2019ve seen a ton of discussions about long-term topics such as Maker\u2019s mission, the RWA strategy, MKR tokenomics and more. I have also read a lot of critique on the state of Maker governance. With this post I\u2019d like to zoom into one particular problem that Maker governance is facing today: Low governance participation rate. With this post I hope to achieve the following:  Highlight the problem and its potential causes; List potential solutions on multiple time horizons; Spark a discussion on how to initiate some of these improvements.   Below are some other critiques on Maker governance that I\u2019ve read over the past few weeks but won\u2019t address in this post. I feel either not mandated or not qualified to address these.  Low delegate retention rate (eg. delegates pursuing other opportunities in the space or laying down their role as delegate); Discontentment with the MIPs framework (eg. too lengthy, too bureaucratic, greenlight polls not effective); Insufficient financial alignment between MKR holders and CU contributors; Legal liability concerns of governance participants.    Problem statement: \u201cLow governance participation rate in MakerDAO\u201d Even though Maker is the oldest and biggest DeFi DAO and the quality of the discussions on our Governance Forum is (arguably) high, not a lot of individuals actively participate in governance votes (ie. polls and executive votes). Some data points to support that claim:  Of all the MKR tokens in circulation (~901k), only ~172k are currently locked in chief and protecting the protocol from governance attacks. That\u2019s less than 20%. Only ~80k MKR tokens have voted on the latest executive proposal. Three recent governance polls which were arguably important only saw up to 21 unique voters, including delegates\u2014representing no more than 108k worth of MKR voting power (example 1, example 2, example 3).   What\u2019s interesting to note is that the governance participation rate in more recent, smaller DAOs is much higher. Let\u2019s consider BanklessDAO as an example; even though their governance proposals are significantly less complex compared to the proposals we see at MakerDAO, their voter turnout is outright impressive (>700 individual votes for some proposals, without explicit incentives!).  Although there are other protocol DAOs which are dealing with even lower participation rates, I would argue that we should prioritise addressing this challenge in order to further decentralise MakerDAO governance. Whatever long-term direction Maker decides to pursue, it cannot succeed without a healthy and engaged governance ecosystem. We need a diverse set of individuals to consider and research proposals, vote, and actively advocate for their views.  What might be the underlying causes 1. Negative financial incentives: \u2014 High cost of participation due to gas fees. Our voting system relies on Ethereum L1 transactions, which have been increasingly expensive due to high blockspace demand. \u2014 Opportunity cost of locking MKR in Maker governance vs \u2018putting it to work\u2019 in DeFi for yield. \u2014 No explicit positive financial incentives to participate in Maker governance (besides defending the protocol from governance attacks). 2. High complexity: \u2014 Proposals are increasingly complex and require specific knowledge and/or due diligence in order to form an opinion on the matter. \u2014 Information relevant to governance proposals is often scattered throughout the Governance Forum, Discord servers, various dashboards, and more. \u2014 Difficulty keeping track of all the proposals and their status (eg. someone engages in discussion on the Forum but does not notice the vote going live). 3. Low perceived impact of individual MKR voting power: \u2014 MKR token voting makes for a plutocracy, where the voting power of some whales and delegates are orders of magnitude bigger compared to most holders. This perceived minimal impact might demotivate active participation. 4. Low composability with the industry: \u2014 Active participation in Maker governance involves moving your MKR tokens around on L1. Although I realise that this mechanism was designed deliberately to prevent governance attacks, it ends up excluding a lot of MKR holders who are not necessarily misaligned with the success of Maker. \u2014 A recent example of this is @Mringz of Index Coop who was eager to get the MKR tokens in the DPI index active in Maker governance\u2014today this accounts for >23M USD worth of MKR! We did not succeed in finding a solution to enable this. \u2014 Although @Growth-Core-Unit and @dux-core-unit have been working hard to help custodians (eg. Anchorage, Coinbase Custody) enabling Maker governance participation for their clients, it involves a lot of custom development and therefore takes a long time. \u2014 Maker governance does not integrate with today\u2019s most popular DAO governance aggregators and tooling such as Snapshot, Tally, Boardroom and Commonwealth.  Challenge statement: \u201cHow might we improve the governance participation rate in MakerDAO?\u201d  Potential solutions related to incentives/costs Short-term   Set up gas cost reimbursement program for recognized delegates. Is @SES-Core-Unit still working on this?  Make more use of forum sentiment polls for soft consensus seeking. We might want to consider using less on-chain polls for soft consensus seeking and defer to forum polls instead, since these do not incur gas costs. I personally like @LongForWisdom\u2019s recent thread on gauging sentiment regarding the Clean Money vision.  Medium-term   Temporarily use third-party tooling for polling. We might want to consider integrating with Snapshot for gasless voting on some eligible governance proposals, which might incentivise smaller MKR holders to participate.  Approach Maker\u2019s voting system as modular and run experiments. Instead of aiming to completely revamp the Maker voting system, we could run isolated scaling experiments against various components in parallel. Examples would be 1) trying to implement a fork of Snapshot into the Governance portal for polling, 2) experimenting with snapshot voting on rollups (eg. StarkWare!), 3) experimenting with moving on-chain governance to L2. Credits to @colby who shared this perspective with me earlier and who\u2019s doing exciting work on this front.  Explore incentives for voting. I personally like Snapshot\u2019s built-in POAP support for votes as I\u2019ve experienced this non-financial incentive being sufficiently powerful to activate me. Another idea I read about was exploring unique NFTs for certain voter milestones, similar to the governance forum badges. We might want to run some experiments with this to test effectiveness.  Long-term   Completely redesign Maker\u2019s voting system in relation to improved tokenomics. If we end up improving the MKR tokenomics we might want to take the opportunity to redesign the Maker voting system from scratch to address the problems mentioned in this post.  Move governance polling to L2. We adopt a L2 scaling solution that does not compromise in the security and trustlessness of L1 Ethereum and fully integrate this solution into the Governance Portal, which would enable near-gasless voting.   Potential solutions related to complexity Short-term   Create tooling for tracking the status of governance proposals. @GovAlpha-Core-Unit did a great job at this through creating the Governance Tracker spreadsheet\u2014I\u2019d love to hear how @Recognized-Delegates have been using this and whether it\u2019s been useful  Seeks ways to aggregate relevant information for voters. This is something we\u2019re looking into at @dux-core-unit\u2014we already came up with some relevant feature ideas for the Governance Portal that we\u2019ll prioritise early next year.  Mid-term   Create more educational content related to governance. I know that the @Content-Production CU is doing excellent work here\u2014creating high-quality videos that should help new voters find their way. We might also want to refresh the user-facing governance documentation\u2014I would love to collaborate on this with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit    Long-term   Have designated subject-matter experts in the DAO. We could explore ways to make it easier for voters and delegates to understand which themes are being addressed by a governance proposal, and who are subject-matter experts. This has been partially addressed by @rune\u2019s concept of Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs). We might even want to consider paid SMEs outside of the DAO.   Closing remarks I\u2019d like to repeat that the above is not an exhaustive list of problems, causes and potential solutions\u2014it\u2019s merely an attempt at aggregating the comments I have read over the past weeks, complemented with my own views. My assumption is that the most effective method for increasing governance participation in MakerDAO would be removing friction in the voting process. This can be achieved through 1) lowering costs of participation through reimbursing today\u2019s most important governance participants (ie. our beloved recognized delegates) and seeking to mitigate gas expenses asap\u2014and through 2) enabling effective decision-making through aggregating relevant information related to governance votes. Therefore I would love to collaborate with some of you to set up experiments and initiatives focussed on these two goals. Please feel free to share thoughts on this post format, any additions to the problems/causes/solutions mentioned above, or any other ideas for improving the governance participation rate. I sincerely hope this post sparks some discussion that eventually leads to initiative. Thank you for reading! ",

I spent a lot of time trying to come up with a rewards model for governance participation that was simple and addressed key concerns.   I was waiting for @LongForWisdom to comment to see if it needed adjustment.   I posted it to my delegate page mostly because I wanted to solicit private comments before publishing it. One thing I wanted to highlight was a point you made regarding DAO governance participation in general and that it is low generally. One point you don\u2019t make that I intend to address with my Maker growth plan is a general issue that \u2018governance tokens\u2019 also represent value.   So there is this distinct competition between tokens in a place they can govern vs. a place they earn return for the holder.   This needs to be changed.   (expect more on this when I release my Maker 1T vision) Since you brought up the issue I propose a potential solution.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:   Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal.  Simple gover\u2026     This is kind of a first step.  Expect more clarity on this within a complete vision post I am trying to finish up.   It has been a hellish week, month and year for me that so far is not getting better unfortunately, this is driving my time in a fully interrupted fashion.    The above is what I came up with after month or two of collecting and analyzing governance data, and then trying to formulate an approach. ",

From a Delegate point-of-view:     0xdeniz:  Set up gas cost reimbursement program for recognized delegates.   I think you make a very interesting point about reimbursing Delegates for gas fees\u2013but I believe that with the new compensation structure, some Delegates should be able to afford their own gas fees. As you know, there are some VCs who want to delegate and are also providing a gas stipend. This is cool\u2013perhaps what GovAlpha should do is provide a threshold of which delegates should be reimbursed. As an example, if a Delegate Platform only carries a few hundred, or thousands of MKR \u2013 perhaps these Delegates should qualify for a gas reimbursement. But for Delegates that will be compensated well, perhaps not.     0xdeniz:  \u2014 Proposals are increasingly complex and require specific knowledge and/or due diligence in order to form an opinion on the matter.   Depending on how well Flip Flop Flap Delegate scales, we plan on hiring folks that can provide expertise on a number of subjects. But in the meantime we also would like to communicate more with the Core Units. We believe this will help in getting our heads-around some of these complex subject matters.     0xdeniz:  \u201cLow governance participation rate in MakerDAO\u201d   What is interesting about a low participation rate is that there\u2019s a lot of people out there, who are looking to work in DeFi/Crypto. I have met a few folks who want to work in this ecosystem and they find the DAO governance structure fascinating. Perhaps @LongForWisdom @prose11 can to set-up a Bounty for Community members to Recruit Delegates? I personally would like to see Women Delegates. Diversity and expansion of Delegate types is super important, IMO. And yes, for sure\u2013its not easy to find qualified people\u2013but we won\u2019t know for sure unless we try.     0xdeniz:  Create tooling for tracking the status of governance proposals. @GovAlpha-Core-Unit did a great job at this through creating the Governance Tracker  spreadsheet\u2014I\u2019d love to hear how @Recognized-Delegates have been using this and whether it\u2019s been useful   For Flip Flop Flap Delegate this is very useful. But I can also tell you that some Community folks I have spoken to are still confused as to how things (specifically collateral types) are prioritize. This could be because some folks don\u2019t digest information thoroughly (as you said, there is so much going on), because I believe GovAlpha has done a nice job of communicating such.

We could explore ways to make it easier for voters and delegates to understand which themes are being addressed by a governance proposal, and who are subject-matter experts. This has been partially addressed by @rune\u2019s concept of Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs). We might even want to consider paid SMEs outside of the DAO.    I think this is a good way forward. With increasing complexity it will be impossible for a single person to have in depth knowledge in every subject. In my view the most important part of governance is being able to strike the right balance between opposing needs of experts. I would say the most pressing expertise is competent legal advice. We have seen some discussions reduced to different interpretations of legal ramifications without a qualified opinion on the matter. Technical expertise can mostly be found in the Core Units, but for the long term it might make sense to have independent technical experts if delegates are meant to be a true check on the Core Units. As Real World Finance grows I would expect the need for valuation and credit experts to emerge. I envision putting these experts into their own Core Unit and made available to all delegates and other stakeholders. Pooling the resources makes sense to me as the need is shared by everyone involved in decision making. Since the needs are similar it doesn\u2019t make sense to do the same work by multiple entities. Right now the lack of such a resource is being met by building teams around existing delegates. This makes sense if the delegates are meant to serve several entities, but less so if the goal is to focus on a single one. ",

Three recent governance polls which were arguably important only saw up to 21 unique voters, including delegates\u2014representing no more than 108k worth of MKR voting power (example 1, example 2, example 3).    Let me intrude in this interesting thread commenting on the above point with just a consideration taken from:  Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway corporation has two classes of stocks, Class A voting stock (NYSE: BRK.A) and Class B non-voting stock (NYSE: BRK.B). The Class B stock carries 1/10,000th of the voting rights of the Class A stock, but 1/1,500th of the dividend.  Rationale: it\u2019s OK to have investors not interested in voting. What we should make sure is that the few that actually take part in voting, well\u2026 actually vote well. I believe the Sagittarium Engine (sketch of) idea of @rune goes into this direction. ",

Maybe this is a way to address the lack of delegate diversity.   So, this is the main reason I have been so in favour of the quadratic funding model that we\u2019re currently trialling, it solves this problem in a better way than having us offer grants. The whole point is that new delegates only need a small amount of MKR in order to start getting non-trivial amounts of DAI (ideally enough to cover gas) quickly enough for it to be worth their time. If GovAlpha starts offering grants, then it means we\u2019re spending the DAO\u2019s money on our opinion of who would make a good delegate for MakerDAO, rather than allowing MKR Holders to make that choice directly. The elegance of the current system is that anyone can setup as a delegate, but they need to attract at least some amount of MKR in order to receive compensation, this gives MKR Holders the power to filter the collection of delegates down to those they want, rather than GovAlpha opining on who the DAO should have. In many cases, delegates also have some of their own MKR which they can delegate themselves, which helps to get them started. This is also a positive filter. We want delegates to have some MKR to their name as that means they are more aligned with the protocol. If a new delegate cannot either:  Attract some MKR quickly enough to cover their expenses; or Acquire some MKR of their own which they can delegate to themselves.  Then they will have to pay out of pocket for gas until such a time as they can attract some delegated MKR. Note that attracting MKR can begin even before the delegate contract is created and votes start to happen. There is nothing stopping potential delegates from using the forum or chat to lobby for delegated MKR, and to try to get commitments from MKR Holders prior to spinning up the contract.  We offer support to anyone that comes to us and says: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about becoming a Recognized Delegate\u2019, including advice, reviewing platforms, discussing any concerns, etc. Ultimately though, it is in MKR Holders hands whether a delegate is successful, or not.

I think you\u2019re doing fantastic work and I always enjoy hearing your arguments on G&R calls so I\u2019m looking forward to reading your longer vision write-up. I fully agree that the next implementation of MKR tokenomics should address the \u2018functional dilemma\u2019 between voting weight in Maker governance and financial utility in DeFi\u2014right now you have to pick one. With regards to your proposal for delegate compensation\u2014I\u2019ll abstain from the discussion re: the exact implementation since I believe @GovAlpha-Core-Unit covers that base and @LongForWisdom shared an idea below.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Depending on how well Flip Flop Flap Delegate scales, we plan on hiring folks that can provide expertise on a number of subjects. But in the meantime we also would like to communicate more with the Core Units. We believe this will help in getting our heads-around some of these complex subject matters.   Thanks for chiming in @flipflopflapdelegate! I believe that delegates/voting committees hiring their own legal advisors is still far away, so until then I think we should try and map out the expertise that we already have available through CU contributors and other members of the DAO. One thing we could do is leverage the poll categories that @GovAlpha-Core-Unit put together previously (click the poll type filter here) and try to identify 1-3 domain experts for each of these\u2014preferably from within the DAO (eg. CU contributors, active forum members). We can turn this in a reference document that delegates can use to source advice/consultation on various topics. What do you think?     Aes:  If you eliminate 2 and 3 I think you\u2019ll find a lot more MKR holders will participate in Governance despite not being able to move the needle themselves.   Couldn\u2019t agree more, and this is where I believe we can really score big wrt governance UX.

I think the #1 deterrent is gas costs, and so I advocate for a gas rebate program for all voters, not just recognized delegates. Individual investors/voters should not be deprioritized just because the delegate program works well. It\u2019s important we give that class of voter consideration. Another piece I think will be important is building that database of Subject Matter Experts. Our team, @gov-comms-core-unit, is working on an internal stakeholder database that can include information about an individual\u2019s subject-matter expertise or specialty. Eventually, the internal stakeholder database will be partially ported to a public stakeholder database where anyone in the DAO can essentially find the person with the relevant expertise. The lowest hanging fruits here are the modular experimentation with off-chain voting and the gas rebates IMO. Educating voters and keeping them on track with regard to specific issues is another very important field of focus. I wonder how we might be able to systematize and streamline issue-specific educational content and updates to voters who are looking for it. I\u2019ve been envisioning a free subscription-like service that lets you get push notifications around specific things at Maker\u2013whether it be parameter changes themselves, updates about specific issues, publications(Maker Relay, MGR, etc), or even delegate platform updates. The idea is you can custom-configure what you\u2019d like to be aware of. We are working with @Content-Production to flesh out the vision and back-end tech to support it. Anyway, just some thoughts. This is an important issue and it looks like there are many ways Maker will be improving so I am excited! ",

I don\u2019t understand why this doesn\u2019t come up more often.  Keeping MKR is a financial investment.  If you\u2019re a whale it\u2019s worth voting with it because you\u2019re impacting the future of your investment. If you are a smaller holder then you only have influence in principle, in practice you don\u2019t matter.  There could be much argument here about the Sagittarius Engine proposed by Rune but the fact is that the proposed cheap or free credit for MKR would solve this problem. For my part I would take the credit and go play with it, and hand the voting power to a sympathetic delegate who understands in depth what he is voting for. The other option might be to \u2018putting it to work\u2019 by another protocol and not vote with it, or sell it (chances are a whale will buy it, it\u2019s plankton to him) and buy something else. It may seem like a simple jerk attitude, but wake up, if you don\u2019t want a few people running the DAO then we should do something like this. Maybe. ",

Individual investors/voters should not be deprioritized just because the delegate program works well. It\u2019s important we give that class of voter consideration.   You make a good point, and it would be worthwhile to calculate the potential cost of such a (temporary) program in order to assess whether it\u2019s worth it for the DAO. Also if we end up pursuing either your proposed scheme (or just recognized delegates for now), I think it would be best to start with a trial. I think SES was working on something related, maybe @juan or @wouter can confirm?     Davidutro:  The lowest hanging fruits here are the modular experimentation with off-chain voting and the gas rebates IMO.   Agreed and I can\u2019t wait to explore this further. I\u2019m especially interested in the work between StarkWare and Snapshot\u2014I\u2019m keeping an eye on that project and I\u2019ll try and get something off the ground.     Davidutro:  Another piece I think will be important is building that database of Subject Matter Experts. Our team, @gov-comms-core-unit, is working on an internal stakeholder database  that can include information about an individual\u2019s subject-matter expertise or specialty. Eventually, the internal stakeholder database will be partially ported to a public stakeholder database where anyone in the DAO can essentially find the person with the relevant expertise.   I wasn\u2019t aware that you\u2019re working on this, but I\u2019m happy to read this! Let\u2019s stay in touch\u2014we might be able to build something useful into the Governance Portal (eg. referencing to internal SMEs for each poll category). ",

I understand the reasoning against self dealing debt. Perhaps one way to do this would be to gate the usage of debt vs MKR with a special vault. The 50x GUNI USDC DAI vault is quite nice. Perhaps can draw debt vs MKR that can only enter a special version of that vault. This would limit the risk that is taken with the debt, better promote product, and allow an avenue for yield generation opportunity if desired. More interesting would be to add different stable options to allow MKR holders to inflate DAI liquidity vs various stables to profit off their vote locked MKR while servicing the bridge between various products and DAI beyond USDC.

                    "content": "Thanks @0xdeniz for creating this thread and giving rise to the discussion. It\u2019s great to see the @dux-core-unit go beyond the (excellent) technical and product development work by facilitating this. I want to echo the slightly contrarian sentiment @iammeeoh is voicing here:     iammeeoh:  Rationale: it\u2019s OK to have investors not interested in voting. What we should make sure is that the few that actually take part in voting, well\u2026 actually vote well.   Voter participation is not a goal in itself. In my opinion, the goals are (1) to have good decision making, (2) a resilient governance system that is hard to corrupt, and (3) security against governance attacks. It is not difficult to come up with examples where high voter participation is actually a bad thing. In many cases this is a variation on the \u201carmy of idiots voting on complex expert matters\u201d scenario. Now, I still think that voter participation is important and I fully support the suggestions that have been made in the opening post. I\u2019m especially excited to experiment more and explore new governance mechanics, to try and recover voting power from yield farming pools, and see progress on governance on L2. My point is that there are two other questions that need to be asked first:  Why does voter participation matter? When does it matter?  I wish I had good answers to these questions, but I find them incredibly complex. What is maybe easier to spot, are the problems that may arise due to low voter participation. But what we will likely find is that these problems are more specific than just general \u201cvoter participation.\u201d For example: Low voter participation leads to unhappy MKR holders because they\u2019re detached from the project, not aligned with the thinking in the governance community. This can lead to bad decision making, chaos (e.g. due to dumping and unproductive, uninformed protest voting further down the line.) But really the issue here is transparency, expectation setting and seeking support for governance policies. Which leads to another insight: voting is not the only form of voter participation. Keeping up-to-date with developments is a form of voter participation. Being a MakerDAO evangelist: \u201cwhy I am an MKR holder,\u201d is a form of voter participation. Etc. Another one: Low voter participation is a bad thing because it exposes MakerDAO to governance attacks. Once again, this does not mean that every small MKR holder needs to vote on every issue (the narrow sense of voter participation), but it may mean that we want to encourage small MKR holders to take a little time to delegate to someone they trust to do the right thing for MakerDAO and review that decision from time to time. This is a different form of participation. Would an election cycle with lots of promotion and activation efforts be beneficial to draw more MKR to good delegates? Picking your delegate of choice is voter participation. So, in a nutshell: let\u2019s consider why, when, and how voter participation matters to get some deeper insights that lead to the ultimate goal: better decision making in a resilient DAO. ",

In my view the most important part of governance is being able to strike the right balance between opposing needs of experts.       JustinCase:  Technical expertise can mostly be found in the Core Units, but for the long term it might make sense to have independent technical experts if delegates are meant to be a true check on the Core Units. As Real World Finance grows I would expect the need for valuation and credit experts to emerge.   Many related comments, but this one comes closest. SES has been discussing a governance party model for a while that is pretty close to the current delegate system where the delegates (1) form expert teams to evaluate different MIP aspects (legal, technical, financial, etc.), (2) express their vision for the protocol and define the high-level objectives that need to be achieved for this and (3) steer capital allocation towards the projects / CUs that move us closer to these objectives.  2021-11-24_2230041284\u00d7717 240 KB   2021-11-24_2234371270\u00d7704 109 KB   2021-11-24_2234531257\u00d7248 13.3 KB  I like @flipflopflapdelegate\u2019s idea of starting out with consulting DAO members for the required expertise while specialized teams are not a reality yet. And I like the idea of pooling resources. While our delegates are doing an excellent job today and offer a great deal of transparency and insight in the decisions they\u2019re making and why, I think there\u2019s checks and balances missing:   Delegates are not really required to be transparent; today this is an expectation but MKR holders may stop caring. I think @LongForWisdom and others who proposed the delegate framework did a good job creating at least a strong expectation while keeping the system open.   The main reason seems that delegates today are intuitively seen as immediately representing MKR holders, but this is an incorrect simplification. They really are our protocol\u2019s politicians with all the related challenges\u2026 how should our politicians be kept in check? What if a delegate promises one thing and uses their votes for another? Will MKR holders notice and hold them accountable?   Should there be a separation of powers? Can delegates make the laws and enforce them? Once again our goal is good decision making. Conflicts of interest have not been solved in any real way.   Do we need a constitution that cannot be changed by delegates but needs direct MKR holders\u2019 support? The difficult question about how delegates should be compensated is just one example of a conflicted decision that may need to be off-limits for delegates to vote on.   All in all I think delegation opened the door to a lot of potential governance improvements. We just need to make sure that we do our homework and ensure the right checks and balances and safety mechanisms do indeed exist. ",

Yeah the concept of \u2018motions\u2019 as a governance primitive is an interesting first step of implementing optimistic governance\u2014I\u2019d personally consider Lido\u2019s implementation as a proof-of-concept and I\u2019m curious to see how it will serve them.     TheExistence:  It seems to emulate a traditional model of delegative democracy, with balanced powers, but which requires an absolute majority of token holders, as the executive branch, for some specific types of voting, right?   I don\u2019t think the absolute majority rule is 100% necessary when implementing a multi-layered governance system\u2014the DAO would be free to design such parameters/thresholds in any way it sees fit. The reason I linked that essay is because I believe the notion of multi-layered governance could be regarded as another potential solution to our problem of low governance participation, as it seeks to only bring important and/or controversial proposals up to a token vote. Other proposals (eg. budget approvals, system parameter changes) could be governed through other systems, such as optimistic governance (ie. vote-to-block/halt instead of vote-to-approve) or automated range polling (eg. the primitives that @colby presented through his research). I\u2019m really happy with the engagement in this thread so far. We started by pointing out some points of friction that might have lead to voter apathy, and now the discussion is shifting towards the viability of using token voting for every single decision that needs to be made\u2014the post I linked yesterday providing an interesting counter-argument. @TheExistence Would it perhaps make sense to do some sentiment polling on the topic of multi-layered governance (including optimistic governance)? I also believe it would be relevant to the ongoing discussion of the collateral onboarding process and the viability of greenlight polls. On the last G&R call @monkey.irish brought up a good point on actor mandate that is needed to \u201cdo the work\u201d. ",

I think this aspect has received little attention in this discussion and I\u2019d like to offer some thoughts. The opportunity cost that comes from locking your MKR in governance can be quite significant and increases the more MKR you hold. At a certain point gas costs becomes trivial but for a larger MKR holder the opportunity cost becomes dominant. What is especially negative about that fact is that larger MKR holders have an easier time making a meaningful impact through votes. The most immediate solution to me would be to allow for MKR to be accepted as collateral. I know there are risk objections to such a move, but as long as MKR is accepted as collateral elsewhere (example AAVE) I don\u2019t see MakerDAO allowing this increasing the  overall risk for the token. We merely drive tokens to other platforms. To draw a parallel to stocks. A stock essentially gives you two things. A right to a proportional part of the profit, and a right to proportional influence governance. MKR gives the two same benefits. Most stocks gives both these rights but a few are split between A and B stocks where (for practical purposes) A stocks have both rights and B stocks only have the rights to profits. What we see in the market is that the voting rights are generally assigned a low value. It is therefore a reasonable assumption that voting rights matter less to the general MKR holder as well. The difference is that with a stock you are free to use that as a collateral and still retain all your voting rights. I think going in this direction could be a viable short term improvement for the incentives to participate in MakerDAO governance. ",

Today only speculators and whales can afford to use L1. There are users who can afford to use L1, but they refuse to because of high fees. Maker should be transformed to use L1 just for settlement of high value transactions ($1M+?). All user actions hapenning on L1 that are important for decentralization should be subsidized out of treasury. A long-term solution would be to build an Android/IPhone governance/voting app which would be easy, fun, cheap and profitable to use (relying on L2s, incentives\u2026). ",
