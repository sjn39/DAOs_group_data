                    "content": "Recently there was a proposal from the yEarn (YFI) community to get whitelisted on the ETH/USD Oracle Security Module in order to create delegated vaults. These delegated vaults allow users to allocate their ETH capital to borrow Dai through the Maker Protocol and execute profitable Dai yield strategies. The key takeaway here is that delegated vaults will stimulate Dai generation and likely liquidity. Because of this I\u2019d like to fast track the whitelisting of yEarns proposal to be included in a Polling Vote this week that would end in time for inclusion in next Friday\u2019s Executive Vote. This is not something I can unilaterally decide so I want to get a signal from the community on whether they approve of this fast tracking. I think a simple majority should suffice, but would like to see a relatively high quorum of 40 votes as this is a big break from our normal governance process and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. EDIT: Due to @LongForWisdom\u2019s response I\u2019ve changed the Signal Request to indicate fast-tracking would be for inclusion in a Polling Vote this week rather than directly into the Executive Vote. I\u2019ve also changed the Signal Request poll to conform to the standards set out in the practical guide. If you\u2019ve already voted, you\u2019ll have to vote again.     Fast-track MIP10c9-SP6 to Fridays Executive Vote Do not fast-track MIP10c9-SP6     0 voters         Fast-track MIP10c9-SP6 to Mondays Polling Vote Do no fast-track MIP10c9-SP6 Abstain     0 voters     ",

As for the potential of delegated ETH Vaults they have the potential to become Vault mega whales as anyone with ETH will be incentivized to deposit their ETH into yEarn\u2019s delegated vault to maximize their yield. This means if this vault were to ever be liquidated we could see a huge amount of ETH get liquidated at once. Though the risk of this is mitigated by the fact that the delegated vault uses the property of the OSM of knowing an hour in advance when the Vault \u201cwould\u201d get liquidated to actively pay down Dai debt at the expensive of yield. The delegated vault will constantly switch to whatever the most profitable yield strategy is. In the short term this will likely provide a big boost in Dai generation which will help stabilize the peg and increase liquidity. However the long term repercussions could see increased Dai volatility when the delegated ETH Vault changes its yield farming strategy. If the delegated ETH vault works well, I could see the YFI community expanding this to include this to many of the collateral types supported in Maker not just ETH. Huge potential for Dai supply. ",

                    "content": "@Nik please read the practical guide to the signalling process. There is a list of requirements that weren\u2019t met below. There is plenty of time before Friday, please make the changes and replace the poll (apologies to those who have already voted.)  Be limited to a single issue This keeps the topic from becoming a confused mess of different conversations. This is not to say that there must be only one poll, only that all the polls should seek signals on the same issue.  Specifically, the title of this thread is misleading. You are polling on whether to fast-track the yEarn whitelisting proposal, not modify whitelisting processes generally. In fact I\u2019m not sure whether that is mentioned explicitly in the text anywhere.  Have the correct tags Using the same tag across the forum makes it easy to find all the signaling topics, it helps keep everything organised, it helps the community see if there are things to signal on, etc etc. The two tags that should be attached to a new signal are  signaling  and  active-signal  .   Use the following settings for any polls:   Results : Visible On Vote  Show who voted : Enabled  Automatically Close Poll : Disabled    Include an 'Abstain option There are several advantages to including an abstain option in a signal request. Firstly, it allows voters to signal ambivalence or protest in a active way. It also allows the Governance Facilitators to check the results of the vote in-progress while remaining neutral.   Arguments against doing this in this way I\u2019m also not at all sure that the quoted benefits justify fast-tracking this proposal. The fact that this will increase Dai generation is a great argument in favour of whitelisting the vaults. But it isn\u2019t an argument to implement the change more quickly than the regular weekly cycle. The current Dai price is roughly 1.005. There is no emergency, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d even argue there is an urgency at the current time. Are we really saying that whitelisting this a week earlier is critically important? Why are we saying that? We absolutely should not be skipping agreed upon processes outside of emergency (or at the very least urgent) situations. It sets a bad precedent. Maybe this particular change is something you agree with, great, I agree with it too. In fact, whitelisting contracts for the oracles is rarely controversial and is almost always pure win. The problem is that the next change that someone tries to fast track might be something you disagree with strongly. The more quickly something goes through governance, the less time people have to express their opinions on the change. The more governance normalizes actions like this, the more likely it is that at some point you\u2019re going to be looking at a change you disagree with that has already been implemented because you weren\u2019t paying attention 24/7 and didn\u2019t have a chance to express your opinion.      Jtathmann:  The last vote we expedited was the ETH-A debt ceiling increase last week, which was recommended by Cyrus, and we ended up doing an on-chain poll before adding to the executive. Maybe that will be a good path forward until we can have a formal emergency/urgency procedure in place.   This would be a better solution, and I would prefer the sequence of events looked like this:  Signal Request to expedite as an emergency action. On-chain poll (probably lining up to finish at the same time as the others) if the signal passes. Inclusion in the executive if the on-chain poll passes.  ",

If this passes, the whitelist proposal will be included in the executive on Friday. For what it\u2019s worth, I think that it was completely unnecessary to fast-track this proposal. Even if the yEarn\u2019s delegated vaults turn on the second this goes through they aren\u2019t going to meaningfully impact the Dai price in the short term (though they may lead to more ETH-A usage.)     NikKunkel:  The key takeaway here is that delegated vaults will stimulate Dai generation and likely liquidity.   This statement is support for this proposal, but not for fast-tracking it. By my current understanding of how the yEarn Vaults work (which admittedly, may not be completely correct.) They allow usage of ETH-A to generate and lock Dai in other protocols to gain the most yield. So while Dai may be generated, it\u2019s unlikely to significantly or quickly affect the Dai price unless it all ends up in an AMM pool like curve. Putting it in curve is dangerous, because the purpose of the vault is to chase the best yield, if all the Dai is traded away via curve, then the capital can\u2019t be removed from curve as Dai to chase other yield opportunities for Dai. This also makes it unavailable for deleveraging in emergencies. So I would be surprised if it ends up in curve or any other AMM. This is a good move on the medium-long term, because it encourages vault usage which Maker has the ability to charge for, additionally, it dilutes yield farming opportunities. However, there is unlikely to be an immediate benefit, and therefore there was no reason to break ratified governance processes to approve it a week earlier than it otherwise would have been.     Mariano_Conti:  I\u2019m in favor of this proposal.   Why are you in favour of fast tracking it? All the arguments you made are in favour of the proposal, not in favour of breaking process to deliver it one week earlier.     SebVentures:  I voted yes, because what we do doesn\u2019t really impact yEarn work.   Why break ratified governance process in a non-emergency situation for something that has no impact? ",

Although we have briefly touched $1, we have yet to move under $1 with any significant volume. We are also not out of the woods in terms of Dai demand from farming. We may have experienced a lull in farming demand, but we are still very much at the mercy of these farmers. It is because of these reasons, I am in favour of expediting most processes that will help with the peg and improve Dai liquidity. This proposal in particular seems very uncontroversial to me. I do understand that we should strive for 100% formal governance processes in the medium/long term, but I also see the middle ground of fast-tracking something simple such as this. ",

Fast-tracking it has no impact (I didn\u2019t see any argument against the underlying proposal). But if yETH launch without it and it leads to a liquidation at some point, it would be better with the whitelisting. I don\u2019t use yearn products. Again, I\u2019m quite sure the yETH trend will have profound impacts on Maker and MakerDAO, not all for the best. I think the last ETH-A DC raise wasn\u2019t following much rules as well (no signal request, a 24h on-chain poll). The last WBTC-A DC raise had a signal request but no on-chain poll. Only the last one was flagged as emergency. So any rule was already broken anyway right? Or more likely, an organic rule have been set. You are 100% correct on that it\u2019s an issue.  We fail at keeping an orderly gouvernance. My take is that we make too much operational decisions and don\u2019t spend enough time on higher complexity problems but obviously it is in itself a complex subject. I would have bet that if a moderator issue a signal request, it was somewhat vetted by the Foundation (it is at least indirectly).

Perhaps a more formal process should be done to determine which actions are intended to have direct impact on the peg or not or perhaps we should fast track this as it was done in the past and have hard stone processes when delegated voting is in place and other mechanisms that incentive participation, I do agree that the exception being the rule is not a positive sign, perhaps adapt the rules to the actual reality that is taking place right now? Every day without the peg in line we reduce our integration prospects, we increase the chances of this being the new normal & we leave money on the table. In summary I support it. ",
