Because this workstream is the primary arbiter of what is allowed on the platform for both Users & Grants, I believe we should abstain from accepting grant funding from Gitcoin Grants rounds. As each community contributor is empowered on their own, I would simply ask contributors of this stream to not apply for any personal FDD related grants. There are contributors who participate in other DAOs and projects, who should be able to post grants for those orgs. Our system has a series of checks and balances that should catch any malicious action from an individual actor within the group. I\u2019d love to hear feedback on this. Personally, I favor the \u201cinform and ask to set community norms\u201d approach over the \u201cmake a rule\u201d method. There is no need for the debate to be rushed in 5 days for a vote when we can simply wait to see if there is an issue that the community cares deeply about and let the norms create the rules we eventually hardcode the execution of to eliminate the need for enforcement. \u201cCryptoeconomics is just economics without room for subjectivity\u201d ",

The mission of Gitcoin begins as \" Our mission is to build and fund digital public goods\u2026\"  We must ensure all participants in the Gitcoin ecosystem are empowered to align with this mission, members of the public AND members of the Gitcoin Dao FDD. There is a delicate balance between preservation of individual liberties and avoiding an apparent ethical conflict of interest.  In pursuit of this balance we must weigh alternatives carefully.  100% I agree we must avoid all appearances of conflicts of interests and strive for objectivity.  Yet the rights of anybody to participate in and improve the ecosystem of decentralization, digtial assets and the Ethereum network are the exact reason Gitcoin exists.  It would be a tragedy to deny a FDD member an opportunity to attain every aid possible in their goals of personal development. Full Disclosure, there is a charity project which I run, in existence on Giveth since early July 2021, which has already applied for and been accepted into GR11.  And I will return any donation from a FDD Member. Crypto-Educate & Feed the Needy. On Gitcoin Crypto-Educate and Feed the Needy.  On Giveth ",

Why? It might become easy to build a team internally and take over the grant reviewing process, then choosing witch grant to approve or not. I can imagine a correlation happening in the grant process. In this case, we have a some options:  For each member or the FDD that would like to apply for a grant, this same grant should be externally reviewed by another team that have no link or any correlation together. Or decline any grant from any FDD contributors literally.  ",
