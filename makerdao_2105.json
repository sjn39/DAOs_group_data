Paragraph Summary This framework attempts to systematize the treatment and allocation of stable assets within the Maker protocol. Such a framework should reduce the need for ad hoc evaluation of individual partnerships where the ultimate underlying asset is bank deposits, cash, government securities, money market funds, or other stable-value instruments designed to maintain a $1 face value.  Component Summary MIP100c1: Definitions MIP100c2: Favored Stable Asset Status MIP100c3: Prohibitions On Stable Assets Without Favored Status  Motivation MakerDAO and the DAI stablecoin are the epitome of decentralized stablecoins. Since developing the PSM (Peg Stability Module) it has protected DAI\u2019s 1:1 dollar peg even in times of severe market turmoil. At the same time, centralized stablecoins and their derivatives make up 65% of all DAI collateral. This capital has mostly been idle, which is about to change, thanks to stablecoin issuers sharing a portion of their yield with MakerDAO. To make such partnerships stable, mutually beneficial, and long-lasting, MakerDAO establishes a list of requirements stable asset partners have to meet to become eligible for a coveted spot in the MakerDAO PSM.  Positive credit assessment by at least one trusted, professional third-party with adequate experience and credentials Competitive marketing incentives that reflect current market conditions These incentives start to be paid out from 100M in the PS; Incentives have to be paid out every month at the very least, more frequent payouts preferred Funds remain in the PSM or can be put into a CES CU Safebox with no vetoing abilities for withdrawal   1600\u00d71015 162 KB   1600\u00d71294 161 KB   Specification / Proposal Details  MIP100c1: Definitions  Stable Asset: An asset that is designed or intended to hold a stable NAV or market price in US dollar terms. Favored Stable Asset: A stable asset that has satisfied the requirements in MIP100c2   MIP100c2: Favored Stable Asset Status To qualify as a Favored Stable Asset, the asset must meet all of the following criteria:  Receive a positive credit assessment by at least one external, professional credit rating agency (or applicable alternative if credit is not involved) Competitive marketing incentives that reflect current market conditions. Marketing incentives might orient themselves along the lines of what Maker arrangers like Monetalis can offer. Where not automatic, incentive payout occurs on all of the assets above 100,000,000 DAI within the Maker Protocol Incentives have to be paid out every month at least, preferably on the block level Assets remain within a Peg Stability Module or in another location where Maker governance can exercise unencumbered control   MIP100c3: Prohibitions On Stable Assets Without Favored Status No stable asset without favored status may purposefully exceed 100,000,000 DAI within the Maker Protocol. This is subject to the following exclusions:  USDC GUSD Stable assets currently within the Maker Protocol that maintain greater than or equal to 100,000,000 DAI in total value Stable assets with crypto-native variable rates (e.g., stable-stable LPs, aDAI)  ",

Stable Assets refer to any asset that is designed to have a fixed Net Asset Value (NAV) or market price in US dollar terms, e.g., cash, USD stablecoins, government securities, etc. The MIP defines a \u201cfavored status\u201d for Stable Assets. To qualify as a favored-status asset, the following conditions must be satisfied:  The asset must receive a positive assessment from an external professional ratings agency. Competitive incentives must be offered to Maker for holding the asset. Incentive payouts must be made on all of the assets if Maker holds over 100M DAI worth of the asset. Incentive payouts must occur at least once a month, ideally more frequently. The assets must remain in a PSM or other structure where Maker Governance has full control over it.   Aside from some exceptions, the protocol cannot hold over 100M DAI of any single non-favored-status stable asset. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

Imo I think we should be pushing our partners to meet us on our level of expectation and be forceful about it. A MIP to encode these expectations might not be immediately enforceable but it at least makes our expectations transparent     rspa:   Receive a positive credit assessment by at least one external, professional credit rating agency (or applicable alternative if credit is not involved) Yield at least 65% of the current Risk-Free Market Rate    imo credit rating agencies are not the right tool for what we are looking to secure. It\u2019s not clear that centralized stablecoins have debt-like guarantees. Respectfully, the list of agencies above is a few members too long and even in its shortened form, is not a source of assurance that the backing is secure and exists. What about, instead of the first two bullets, something like:  Bankruptcy-remote holding vehicle or vehicles with regular independent attestation of reserves Ability for independent third-party individuals and organizations to verify and attest existence and integrity of backing assets Real-time asset monitoring dashboard with detail on asset type and counterparty exposure Transparent investment framework with a minimum amount of assets held with concentrated counterparty exposure (no more than 25%) and a maximum level of risk exposure capped at 3mo US Treasuries Sharing at least 65% of the prevailing Fed Funds Rate (Risk Free as defined probably works too)  Also not sure whether letting USDC and company off the hook makes it easy for them to coast. In my personal view we should be pushing them in the same direction too. Keen to hear other views. ",

On top a diversification constraints should avoid creating a monopoly. I would also argue that some cadence would help partners, like there is a reset every quarter. I would suggest to be careful of exceptions. For stablecoins, a rating is maybe possible, but community also need to consider the regulation. Is NYDFS regulated any value? * Liquidity is also more nuanced due to balance sheet capacity. Is USDP more liquid than USDC when we need it? Is on-chain liquidity a serious indication? Many point that community can decide. ",

Do the restrictions apply once they fall below 100 million DAI?     GFXlabs:  Presumably GovAlpha would not allow it to come to a vote without individual authorization or amendments to this MIP.   Ideally, this would be specified within the MIP. it should be clear what the implications of this MIP being ratified are. So, if I\u2019ve understood it correctly, I\u2019d include something to the effect of:  \u201cIf a stablecoin asset does not meet the requirements in MIP100c2, and is not excluded by the specific exclusions in MIP100c3, GovAlpha or equivalent entities must not permit a vote on raising the Maximum Debt Ceiling of that asset\u2019s Peg Stability Module above 100,000,000 DAI.\u201d  Have you considered the effects of this MIP on already existing stablecoin yield sharing deals e.g. MIP81, GUSD agreement, Paxos proposal?

On the credit rating of the stablecoins it appears some of the rating agencies are working internally on rating models for stable coins - but no public ratings are currently available - so in the absence of a credit rating being available. I would suggest that an alternative approach - to ensure safety would be as folllows:  Require a legal opinion confirming assets backing the relevant stable coin are segregated and custodied (without rehypothecation) Require that the stablecoin issuer produces on a regular basis (monthly or more frequently) a proof of reserves report - confirming 1) that their are sufficient assets backing the stablecoin 2) that such assets are highly liquid and are the appropriate risk (ie. near cash and/or short term government securities) and 3) that the custodied assets are confirmed to be physically segregated from other assets. This report needs to be issued by an acceptable auditor or accounting firm That entities custodying the underlying aseets have an acceptable credit rating (to be determined based on research)  For liquidity, I would suggest that we look at the overall liquidity of the particular stable, and constrain the amount in the PSM to a percent of the liquid supply.

                    "content": "Hi @rspa Quite an elephant problem you have chosen to wrestle with here! Let me give you a splattering of thoughts, and questions to think about, that I hope you can build on for this good conversation you have started. What does MakerDAO want from Stablecoins in the PSM? My assumption is that the primary purpose of having stablecoins on Makers balance sheet is to promote/\u201dharden\u201d the stability of the DAI peg through:  the implicit promise of 1 DAI exchangeable for 1 USDC/GUSD/etc (all hard-pegged and redeemable to 1 USD) somewhat set out by the existence of the PSM - and; the ability to deliver on this implicit promise from having millions/billions of these readily available in the PSM.  Obviously this requires proper care and attention is taken on evaluating these stablecoins - as you suggest - need to ensure they are both liquid and value stable. Otherwise the above implicit promise will deteriorate in value I assume? And with potential troubling consequences for DAI peg stability\u2026 Only secondarily is the requirement or desire for yield/interest/rewards? Because one probably has to realise that clearly establishing qualities of \u201cliquidity\u201d and \u201cvalue stability\u201d in a currency/stablecoin/instrument at the highest level - equal to fundamentally dollar bills or bank created ledger money - does not usually carry much reward outside of its fundamental qualities? The concepts of debt \u201cmoney-ness\u201d, liquidity and NQA vs MQA Let me take a step back and present to you a basic framework I hope you might find useful as you think more about stablecoins and money more broadly. All debt has a degree of \u201cmoney-ness\u201d - and everything you in daily consumption would consider to be money is debt. \u201cMoney-ness\u201d relates to the simple ability of using this debt as a payment instrument between parties on a No-Question-Asked basis (NQA) in a very large relevant population. Let me explain with a few examples:   Dollar bills are backed by \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the US Government - i.e. dollar bills are ultimately a government debt. But generally the world accepts this debt instrument (i.e. the US dollar bill) as a means of payment with NQA - i.e. none of us try to do due diligence on the US government - thinking it might default etc etc\u2026   Think about money in your bank account - they are essentially bank ledger money issued by the bank and so debt on the bank. If you pay me for something by transferring money to me digitally, then I also accept this money on an NQA basis. I don\u2019t think about whether your bank or my bank in fact are solvent etc\u2026 Somehow, I suspect, you and I have decided to trust that the regulators make sure the banks are solvent and we may have this view that the Federal Reserve will always act as Lender of Last Resort to sort out a bank in trouble - plus of course there is FDIC.   You can probably now guess that the opposite of NQA is Many-Questions-Asked (MQA) - I.e. If you want me to take the IOU you have from one of your friends as payment, well then I have many questions before I accept that IOU as payment - might not even accept it at par\u2026 So all debt can be put on a spectrum of \u201cmoney-ness\u201d - from intensely MQA to globally accepted NQA. You can now also connect this to liquidity, because only debt in a state of NQA is truly liquid and, as such, money. Because, clearly, if you need to ask and get answered a ton of questions every time you need to use a debt instrument as payment and maybe even discuss whether to accept this debt at par - well - then the instrument is illiquid (and not money). Right now, I think, you can probably only really find government-backed (explicitly or implicitly) debt instruments as having achieved real, broad NQA state - and that is paper money (i.e. money created by the government) and bank ledger money (i.e. money created by the banks - the vast majority of money supply today of course). Probably all stablecoins today are in one form of MQA or another - sort of various distances away from reaching an NQA state. Please remember that NQA vs MQA is not so much about your personal view - it is about whether the broad, relevant, population is seeing the debt instrument one way or another. If a lot of people have questions about a stablecoin it is necessarily not in a real state of broad NQA - and so probably must be considered carefully in respect of liquidity and value stability. This is not a framework that I have just come up with - this is an academic product mainly attributed to Bengt Holmstrom (MIT) and worked further on by many academics like for instance Gary Orton (Yale) etc etc. And if you feel I have explained them inadequately I can recommend the original research papers on this - they are quite good. It is being used in analysis of stablecoins in academia. MQA \u2192 NQA - how? We do know that various versions of private (non-government backed) money have been accepted on a NQA basis for very long periods in history - Scotland, Sweden and I believe New England for instance. I can only encourage stablecoin interested readers to go over these cases. The fact is that there is no established logic/cause-effect path for how you reach a state of NQA. There seems to be a not insignificant sentiment-based portion in how a population broadly determines whether a debt instrument is to be accepted on an NQA basis. This probably means that for any logical evaluation one might do of a stablecoin (i.e. is it liquid, stable etc) there will always be a sizable component we can never truly measure - this sentiment-based component. This Bagehot quote seems appropriate here: \u201cEvery banker knows that if he has to prove he is worthy of credit, in fact his credit is gone\u201d Main Challenge of CeFi Stablecoins: Immature regulatory and legal situation? Now all that being said - I probably think the core, non-sentiment based, challenge for CeFi stablecoin lies in the fact that the regulatory, monitoring etc scheme that is intended to create comfort with the general public on something akin to NQA basis is really at a developing stage. If I compare with bank ledger money, I suppose one could - very broadly - sketch out the situation as such:      CeFi Stablecoin Bank (fx Basel III)     Regulation Developing Comprehensive   Monitoring & Tests Developing Very Comprehensive   Accounts Generally Private (except Proof of reserves) Aggregate Public + Monitoring Results   Legal Precedents for common and edge-cases outcomes limited Comprehensive    At this time, for instance, NYDFS, as I understand it, is making a good start at developing an appropriate comprehensive scheme - but of course still has some way to go - and of course - the most challenging contentious edge-cases have not been addressed \u201cin action\u201d and so little precedent exists. It is hard to reach an NQA state in this type of environment one might argue. Now - if you are a CeFi stablecoin, I reckon you could have one of two basic responses to this situation:   Evolve with the regulation - i.e. when the regulatory and legal framework matures for stablecoins, the specific stablecoin will equally do so. Which - in fairness - could be many years.   Try to pre-empt the regulation - it is, today, perhaps, not entirely impossible to predict where regulation will end up on a good number of items for a stablecoin(?). The regulatory circumstances around Money-Market Funds and Banks should hold some rather clear clues and patterns. As such, a CeFi stablecoin could start implementing these \u201cbest guess\u201d measures into processes, public reporting, contractual certainties, third-party independent oversight mechanisms etc etc\u2026   One could even suggest that the current \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, would be a perfect time for a stablecoin to work on consolidating its \u201cmoney quality\u201d - and communicating this effectively to the world - i.e. choosing option b) above - as a good strategic choice? One could argue that Increased \u201cmoney quality\u201d should ultimately deliver long-term, sustainable circulation and market share in a crypto spring? Perhaps signs of how a CeFi stablecoin is thinking about this a/b decision is a good clue to consider in evaluating them? Tells about where they are heading and at what pace? Worth thinking about. Current Liquidity & Value Stability: a strong or weak signal of robustness? How about the current circulation and stability of a stablecoin? doesn\u2019t that say a lot about its staying power? So interestingly enough, I suppose, you can reasonably easily create a situation where it is the best strategy for an individual to assume a stablecoin is stable+liquid and allow transactions on a 1:1 NQA basis, within a certain environment, even if the individual actually does not believe this to be the case outside of this environment and would not accept a 1:1 conversion. This is not the best example and oversimplifies, but think about a casino where you need to buy tokens to play in high-risk/high-return games. You may think that these tokens are entirely dodgy and would never try to use them as a transaction currency for buying eggs and milk or even store your long-term values in them, but you are happy with using them in the casino and even trade with others in the casino on a 1:1 basis. Basically the games of the casino have such high-return potential that you are happy to add the risk of the tokens not really necessarily being 1:1 worth to your gambling situation and thus trade the tokens 1:1 within the casino for ease of moving between games, transaction with other players - and basically making your casino visit effective. So you can ask yourself: is the crypto-market today similar to the above situation? And are people just accepting 1:1 conversion for many stablecoins because it is convenient and the risk of these stablecoins, implicitly, actually taken into account, given the types of high-return gambles available and cost of entry/exit of the market? And, as such, is circulation volumes a weak predictor of actual stablecoin \u201cmoney-ness\u201d and long-term viability in a situation where the crypto-market becomes less speculative, but more a stable global financial market? A counter argument could be that with the arrival of crypto-winter all potential \u201cgamblers\u201d have somewhat disappeared and the circulation and stability seen by stablecoins today are indeed sustainable and based upon general viability and not \u201crisk-adjusted\u201d for high-returns \u201cgames\u201d - as not many such games exist anymore in the crypto-industry? I offer no answer or opinion here, but it seems worth thinking about? Mess with Mr Market and risk that Mr Market messes with you? So - one can take the view that - well - no stablecoins are probably in a perfect NQA state today, but Maker does have to work with some and probably Maker should be quite generous about requirements on these stablecoins to aid in the overall growth of the crypto-market. Now - Maker must work with some - given the peg hardening assumption mentioned above is correct. But should there be some quite hard limits to the degree to which Maker would want to invalidate market forces? If the market suggests a certain stablecoin only finds limited traction should Maker then push against this and aid in its traction? Would doing so be hampering or helping the development of a healthy crypto market? And does Maker have the scale to press against market gravity? If you think about it, the markets for a global settlement currency has a tendency - for convenience and transaction/friction cost etc - to be a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d - i.e. USD is clearly established as the world currency without any real competition? Should one expect the same to happen in the crypto-markets and somewhat allow that to happen in the market without interference? A counter argument could be that it is good for the industry and industry participants to push against the formation of a monopoly? And so Maker should go out of the way to aid more players to reach a relevant competitive size? Again I have no opinion or answers, but seems worth thinking about? When is the price right? You get no rewards or interest for carrying dollar bills - and you only get very limited for on-demand deposits of bank created money. MMF are \u201cnear\u201d money and do pay interest, but still - you can\u2019t really transact with MMF as with money. Is a good stablecoin somewhere in-between these two? Sort of an on-chain liquid money-market fund? And is then the right price somewhere below a money market fund to account for the stablecoins liquidity? Or should it actually be above a MMF because it broadly isn\u2019t regulated as tightly as a MMF? Basically is there a relevant comparable one could consider as setting a reasonable level for what to expect in any rewards from a CeFi stablecoin? \u2013 Hopefully a few thoughts and questions in there that you found helpful and sparked some further thinking. Looking forward to seeing where this MIP discussion take things. ",

Basically, is there a relevant comparable one could consider as setting a reasonable level for what to expect in any rewards from a CeFi stablecoin?   This is something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot. In my view, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s incomplete, MakerDAO excels at on-chain collateral. We\u2019ve seen the auction system and PSM perform exactly as they wished for during the most intense market turmoil last year. At the same time, our exposure to off-chain assets in one form or other has expanded. Some in the form of stablecoins with deep market liquidity and some with much less. The price of a stablecoin to Maker is the yield it is not making by investing these assets into higher-yielding, but less liquid assets. Basically an opportunity cost. What premium is right here? Recent discussions with Gemini led to verbal assurances that they could redeem \u201cunlimited\u201d amounts of GUSD at a moment\u2019s notice, even if there was 0 on-chain liquidity. If we take that at face value (NQA), how do we set the price of GUSD in comparison to, say, the short maturity MMF backing MIP65 (mostly)? You\u2019re definitely right that the answers to these questions need more maturity and sophistication. I feel this dialogue is helping to get there. ",
