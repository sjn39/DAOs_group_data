Thanks for your feedback, highly valuable!     lanlan3322:  Grants review manually is becoming unrealistic by a small team   Right now we have 2 separate decentralized squads working on to review each grants under 24/48 hours delay. We had the first \u201cSplitting Squad\u201d on the first of November I think.     lanlan3322:  Community is not encouraged to be involved in the grants verification process   I think the community is highly encouraged to be involved in the grants verification process, we are actively getting more user and contributors involved in that part only.     lanlan3322:  Any \u201cWatcher\u201d has the right to \u201cFlag\u201d a suspicious grant submission with X*GTC deposit and detailed reasons   This is already possible to \u201cFlag\u201d a grant, once a grant has been \u201cFlagged\u201d we will carefully review it. Any member of the community can \u201cFlag\u201d a grant. @David_Dyor can tell you more about that process since he\u2019s building up the policy\u2019s. We are also planning on creating an interface UX-UI to review these grants, either on dGrants or on Gitcoin. Feel free to jump in the conversation on Discord or we can keep this post up. ",

We (the Fdd) have been talking to a project already (Celeste) but the goal is to have a modular system where a variety of court-like systems can fit in.  As for policy, all docs are migrating to Gitbook where current versions will be accessible to everyone. The FDD also developed an appeals procedure intended to be used with the future iteration of the grants program.  I can see being used after the \u2018marking\u2019 process you describe.  In the legacy version of grants what you call marking was called flagging. Would like to see a short gamified training quest for the \u2018Markers\u2019 much like the Grant Evaluation Squads receive a small amount of training.  In the legacy system anybody had the ability to mark/flag a grant.  Even members of the public.  Sometimes industry folks like to squeal on each other.  I would like to see that preserved somehow.  Lots to discuss and I look forward to meeting you. ",

We are perfectly ok right now but if we see the future when there are 100+ or even 1000+ submissions (who knows it is not happening?!   ) the review pressure will be hard to handle by dedicated members. Instead, it will be easier to hand over to all members in the system. For now, the community is basically involved by \u201cGoodwill\u201d and there could be a more sustainable way to keep encouraging members to join the mission with a proper incentives system established. The present \u201cFlag\u201d function is easily attacked without any protection. Malicious actors would do irresponsible flagging to overload our review teams. To align with GitcoinDAO concept we could build these small DAO components which will eventually stack up a whole DAO system.  ",

                    "content": "The ratio of the reward and punishment needs to be compared to the prevalent rates of false negatives [faulty grant application getting approved]. For example, you propose a ratio of 30:1, and if the rate of false negatives is 5%, it may pay to simply flag every grant. Unfortunately we may not have very precise empirical numbers for false negatives, and not only because the criteria are somewhat vague, given the entire range of grant applicant and subject matter possibilities, and the judgements are inherently subjective. With various grant subtypes and a range of possible failing criteria, somewhat unevenly distributed over time, it is not immediate how to map any set of secondary evaluations to the entire population of the grant applications.
