                    "content": "TL;DR: We should not refer to ourselves as a lender, much less a bank. That\u2019s not an accurate description of what Maker does, invites political/regulatory risk that we are actually not subject to, means that a negative SB should not always result in minting MKR, and recognizes the technical innovation by our PE team of enabling trustworthy self-lending for the first time in human history. (I honestly think that latter one is worthy of an economics Nobel) This is a discussion I\u2019ve wanted the community to have for a while. On the surface, this will sound like semantics, but it has some very important ramifications, so please bear with me. The Maker Protocol is not a lender. Maker has two lines of business at present: trading and loan guarantees. The simpler of the two businesses is what we all know as the PSM. It functions by providing a fixed price at which we will both buy and sell the tokens known as USDC and DAI. DAI issued through the PSM are zero-coupon, perpetual-maturity debt issued by the Maker Protocol. In accounting terms, these should be listed as liabilities and the USDC we hold are an offsetting asset. The net effect on our balance sheet should be zero unless something goes wrong. The reason the USDC in the PSM is an asset is because Maker can control it. It not, however, a deposit, as Maker holds it free of any obligation to return it \u2013 we could turn off the PSM at any time if we really felt like it. By the same token, the DAI issued through the PSM is not a loan asset, but debt Maker has issued itself. The second line of business is that Maker provides a machine \u2013 in the form of smart contracts \u2013 that allows people to lend to themselves. This sounds strange, but note that Maker does not hold the collateral of the user. It also does not lend out the DAI to the user. Those are both done by the machine \u2013 the smart contract \u2013 and the property of the user. In, for instance, an ETH-A vault, both the collateral and the loan are on the user\u2019s balance sheet, not ours. This is analogous to Microsoft providing the Word program, but it does not own the output of that program. You own the words you type in Word, you own the photo you take with an iPhone, you own the bread you bake in your oven. Likewise, Maker neither owns nor holds the collateral or loan associated with a vault. It simply supplies the machine that allows people to lend against themselves \u2013 a novel and underappreciated innovation. To make those loans users borrow from themselves marketable \u2013 in the form of DAI \u2013 Maker guarantees that debt will be backed by at least $1 in assets. This makes the debt fungible and in some way ultimately redeemable, allowing it to trade in the market at around face value. If a user\u2019s debt goes bad, the machine begins the liquidation process automatically. Fees collected by Maker in the form of SF or liquidation penalties are akin to the subscription you pay for other software, or a premium paid to a guarantor of your debt. This has very important implications. The most obvious is simply that being a guarantor of loans is a much more accurate description of Maker than being a lender. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not concise way to describe that role, so I will admit I am just as guilty as everyone else who uses \u201ccrypto lender\u201d as a shorthand for what Maker does. The next implication is that erroneously referring to ourselves as a lender or even a bank exposes us to future regulatory scrutiny that is unwarranted. Maker is not a bank \u2013 we do not accept custodial deposits \u2013 and it is not a lender \u2013 we only issue our own debt through the PSM and guarantee the debt of standard vault classes. Both of those are subject to varying amounts of regulatory oversight and scrutiny in a wide array of jurisdictions. The business of trading DAI/USDC with our own funds and the business of offering guarantees for loans generated with our software in exchange for subscription revenue/premium due only upon liquidation is decisively less exposed to onerous regulation. The final implication is that MakerDAO has far more equity than it appears at first glance. If all DAI issued really were loans we held on our books, then our balance sheet looks much, much larger, and holding much, much less equity. I have not attempted to estimate a balance sheet for us recognizing our activities as loan guarantees rather than loans, but the key understanding is the the SB is an asset \u2013 our cash reserves \u2013 and does not represent the actual equity \u2013 or solvency \u2013 of Maker. At the moment, these will appear to be very similar to each other in number, as the PSM assets/liabilities will cancel each other out and the SB is mostly the asset that is left. But as CUs become operational, there are both funds inside them that Maker can potentially claim on its balance sheet, and they will have tangible and intangible assets that Maker can claim as well (assuming the CU is not merely a contractor, but that\u2019s another discussion). This is probably not the time for it, but it also implies we should revisit whether Maker should automatically mint in the event of a negative SB, as that merely implies that cash on hand < outstanding DAI debt issued by the DAO directly to cover expenses or guarantees of bad self-lending debt. I suggest we begin to consistently recognize and push a form of this self description to both make it clear to our user base what Maker does, and to keep ourselves at arm\u2019s length from unnecessary regulatory risk. Note that philosophical mission statements need not be affected by this recognition of the practical realities of Maker\u2019s business. ",

Thanks for posting, looking forward to digging into some of the finer points I disagree with here, but preface this with I am not a lawyer and do not know what legal implications exist for different framings, just my two cents on what makes sense as a dedicated community member.     PaperImperium:  means that a negative SB should not always result in minting MKR   I would offer some pushback here, the entire incentive alignment of the system is based on MKR holders being diluted when poor policies are approved that put the protocol at risk. The system relies on this mechanism to encourage MKR holders to pay attention, and importantly to not vote anything in that has undue risk of this happening.     PaperImperium:  an ETH-A vault, both the collateral and the loan are on the user\u2019s balance sheet, not ours.   This is also a bit problematic. DAI has its value because of its collateralization commitment. If the items were truly only on the user\u2019s balance sheet we would have no need for over collateralization and we would have no interest in what the user is allowed to do with the smart contact (in terms of minimum collateralization, SF, asset offerings). It is very important that we understand these items as on our own balance sheet, or we will not be able to make decisions that keep the protocol safe and DAI at its peg.     PaperImperium:  If a user\u2019s debt goes bad, the machine begins the liquidation process automatically. Fees collected by Maker in the form of SF or liquidation penalties are akin to the subscription you pay for other software, or a premium paid to a guarantor of your debt.   Saying this doesn\u2019t make it so, IMO. After all, we are dealing with cryptocurrencies And cannot ignore the financial implications because it makes us feel better about the regulatory risk. The risk is there regardless, and I believe attempting to obscure this is a disservice both to our marketing efforts and to our decision making process. Maker looks a lot like early 19th century banks and I think it is dangerous not to acknowledge this and learn from the mistakes that were made in traditional finance.     PaperImperium:  but the key understanding is the the SB is an asset \u2013 our cash reserves \u2013 and does not represent the actual equity \u2013 or solvency \u2013 of Maker.   Important to remember that we use the SB to pay our expenses, like the cost of our workforce. We can count on some good will from dedicated community members (I, for one, am not gone at the first missed paycheck) but with the inability to pay people we can\u2019t expect a functioning growth machine for very long. Want to check with @SebVentures here, but pretty sure it\u2019s also problematic to have the SB on the asset side of the ledger, as it would be returned to DAI holders in the event of an Emergency Shutdown. Just some thoughts on why I have been in full embrace of the (de)Central Bank meme and why it\u2019s a hard mindset to break free of anytime soon. ",

                    "content": "So these are great questions! Let me go through them one by one.     prose11:      PaperImperium:  means that a negative SB should not always result in minting MKR   I would offer some push back here, the entire incentive alignment of the system is based on MKR holders being diluted when poor policies are approved that put the protocol at risk. The system relies on this mechanism to encourage MKR holders to pay attention, and importantly to not vote anything in that has undue risk of this happening.   The statement you made is not incorrect. The thing to remember is that the SB does not represent whether Maker is solvent \u2013 it represents cash on hand. Historically, these seem like they have been the same thing. As the DAO spreads assets into places that are not just the SB, then this shorthand is no longer going to be accurate. Additionally, negative equity would not necessarily imply that Maker could not meet its ongoing expenses and obligations. Even Apple does not keep more cash on hand than all of its liabilities. That does not make Apple insolvent, though, because it has other assets. The DAO is moving into a stage where there will be assets in places other than the SB. So while the SB is for now a good approximation of whether Maker has a positive equity value, this will not always be the case, and we will want to keep that in mind going forward.     prose11:      PaperImperium:  an ETH-A vault, both the collateral and the loan are on the user\u2019s balance sheet, not ours.   This is also a bit problematic. DAI has its value because of its collateralization commitment.

It is very important that we understand these items as on our own balance sheet, or we will not be able to make decisions that keep the protocol safe and DAI at its peg.   DAI does have value because of the collateralization commitment \u2013 of the user who created the DAI. Maker stands as a backstop should that user not be able to continue to make good on that promise. That does not make it our balance sheet item. If you buy a car by taking on a loan, but your parent guarantees the loan, that does not make either the car or the loan your parent\u2019s asset/liability. At least, not until you default and it falls to them. The peg is how we guarantee the debt. We guarantee that anyone holding debt in the form of DAI can trade it for a close approximation of $1 on the secondary market.     prose11:      PaperImperium:  If a user\u2019s debt goes bad, the machine begins the liquidation process automatically. Fees collected by Maker in the form of SF or liquidation penalties are akin to the subscription you pay for other software, or a premium paid to a guarantor of your debt.

Maker looks a lot like early 19th century banks and I think it is dangerous not to acknowledge this and learn from the mistakes that were made in traditional finance.   I\u2019m not aware of any crypto asset that has been recognized as a currency by any major jurisdiction. However, that doesn\u2019t change the mechanics. It could be a cash-secured loan and still operate the same way. Microsoft does not own the copyright to a book you write, and we do not own the debt a user is able to issue to themselves. I think it would help if we imagined what Maker does, but in physical cash. If Maker rented out a machine in the privacy of your own home or business that functioned as a cross between a safe and an ATM, where you put in one asset, it was locked away from everyone, and dispensed paper DAI, would we be providing a loan? I would argue no. We rent out the machine and also guarantee the debt to anyone willing to take it as payment. We do not access the collateral \u2013 no one can \u2013 except in the case that this batch of DAI debt is no longer soundly backed by collateral. We are not even a pawn shop \u2013 we do not take deposit or custody of the asset used as collateral. But Maker has invented a machine that people trust to be honest about the collateral-to-debt ratio.     prose11:      PaperImperium:  but the key understanding is the the SB is an asset \u2013 our cash reserves \u2013 and does not represent the actual equity \u2013 or solvency \u2013 of Maker.

We can count on some good will from dedicated community members (I, for one, am not gone at the first missed paycheck) but with the inability to pay people we can\u2019t expect a functioning growth machine for very long. Want to check with @SebVentures here, but pretty sure it\u2019s also problematic to have the SB on the asset side of the ledger, as it would be returned to DAI holders in the event of an Emergency Shutdown.   The SB is our net cash position vs DAI we have ourselves issued (plus any cash we hold inside CUs that are true \u201csubsidiaries\u201d and not contractors). If it goes negative, that is because we have either had to assume debt that went bad (in which case it does move onto our balance sheet) or have spent more than we hold. What does a negative SB mean in practice? It means we have issued DAI debt, just as we do with the PSM, but without the collateral on hand to back it in the event of an instantaneous settling (the ESM is the most likely scenario). I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good or desirable thing \u2013 just that it is not always a bad thing and not always catastrophic as long as income allows current expenditures to be met. Just like a person can have negative net worth from racking up credit card debt on frivolous expenses, or have negative net worth because they have enormous loans to finance an education, the mere existence of a negative SB shouldn\u2019t spell catastrophe \u2013 especially as the SB ceases to represent all of Maker\u2019s assets. One can easily imagine a case where the SB goes below 0, but there are still tens of millions of DAI in CU wallets. That doesn\u2019t mean Maker can\u2019t \u2013 if forced to \u2013 meet all its obligations. That situation wouldn\u2019t be one to celebrate, but also should not automatically lead to a policy of dilution. There are definitely more details that will crop up, but I think the key test is:   Do we take deposits? We do not. We do not access our users\u2019 collateral in any way except in liquidation.   Do we issue loans? Loans are issued by the smart contracts, not by Maker. DAI do not move from the SB to the user. They are generated at the user level with a smart contract provided by Maker.   Do we actually pay the debt for a vault? Not typically. Only if the user cannot continue to ensure the debt is properly backed. If we don\u2019t pay it, it\u2019s not our debt. If we do pay it, then it becomes our debt.   What do we do with debt that doesn\u2019t need to be liquidated? We rent our credit history/reputation to our users so that their own self-issued debt is both fungible and accepted in the market at face value. We do this by promising to assume the debt is the user becomes undercollateralized.   ",

My reading of recent history is that regulators are much more focused on functional equivalence than actual technology or mechanisms. EDIT: To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting anything about Maker specifically but simply describing my reading of the existing regulatory framework. For a typical regulator, the problem boils down to accurately describing the economic substance of the activity in question and whether it can be grouped under an existing category or whether it is so radically innovative that it defines a new category (and thus necessitates an entirely new regulatory stance/practice). That said, throughout history, there has always been a gap between regulatory enforcement on paper vs. in practice, and very often that\u2019s been due to both financial and technological innovation.  This is slightly off-topic but I think framing ICT (incl. blockchain networks and Maker) as first and foremost machine/software-based automation makes a lot of sense (see The Great Automaton) but that alone is unlikely to suffice as an answer on how to define Maker from a regulatory point of view.

                    "content": "Maker is not a bank, agreed, although the DSR requires some detailed explaining and Maker should discourage even third parties from describing it as a savings account. Maker is a lender, just not a lender in the normal banking sense.  I think we need to be careful about trying to describe Maker in a heightened complex way to try to avoid regulation and instead provide a clear description that will be understandable to a court or regulator.  Because the more complex it becomes the more likely a court or regulator - right or wrong - interprets the description as a coy end-run and then throws the entirety in the trash.  I\u2019m not saying any of your analysis is wrong - maybe because I\u2019m not smart enough in accounting to have an educated opinion  - but reading this description I think a point where a judge would stop listening is the claim that the person is self-borrowing and all Maker did was create a machine to do it.  I can hear the interruption from the court: wait, you are telling this court that Walgreens is not in the photo business because it is not Walgreens it is a machine that pops out a photo when the user pops in money and a .jpeg?  The nearby casino is not in the gambling business because a user of a slot machine is actually self-gambling with a computer program?  Even though the casino takes money from the slot machine? Part of Maker\u2019s goal to avoid shut-it-all-down or stifling regulation is to make its product sufficiently popular that users of it and through them politicians will stand in the way of regulators who may think differently.  Like Uber/Lyft.  I can tell you that as Uber was becoming a craze on the coasts, state common carrier regulators in Nebraska were watching and waiting to shut them down and even take vehicles away from drivers, because the Uber model is absolutely 180 degrees from Nebraska\u2019s laws regarding taxi service.  When Uber came, that happened for about 24 hours and then regulators stopped, not because of an Uber court win but because the regulators came under pressure from politicians and the public who cried out for Uber service. As I see it, Maker is a very sophisticated pawn broker that does not lend money but lends store tokens, and no one borrowing ever incurs a personal liability (helpful to avoid consumer lending regulation) - the pledged asset owes the debt/obligation to return the tokens plus a fee.  The reasons people are willing to pledge assets for those store tokens are (1) Maker accepts such tokens for all debt owed to it, (2) Maker (presently) will exchange those tokens one for one for tokens of another company that will exchange one for one with the USD, and (3) the crypto world\u2019s acceptance of Maker\u2019s store tokens as having value and a stable value and within that Maker\u2019s reputation and proven performance in keeping those tokens valued in the open market within tenths of a cent of the USD.  Additionally the borrower\u2019s collateral is not in the control of anyone/thing that can make human judgment calls outside fixed contracted terms, which means there never is discrimination based on race, sex, etc. in initiating a loan or in exercising default remedies. Now in response to that a regulator may say A-HA you are not registered as a pawnbroker!  Which in Nebraska the answer would be that our statutes regulate those that lend \u201cmoney\u201d on pledged collateral and Maker never lends money.  And that argument works on many finance laws/regulations in Nebraska and I bet as well in many other jurisdictions.  Circling back, if governments are hell bent on regulating Maker they will just change the law - our goal is to show those governments directly or indirectly through citizen pressure that Maker does not need to be further regulated.

So I am obviously not an attorney, so I will defer to you and others on that point. The two analogies that came to my mind were ones where the machine is released into the world and it is the user who accrues the benefits and liabilities of use \u2014 guns and cameras. I don\u2019t think we have the ability to restrict who uses our vaults, though I am unsure to what extent we solicit use from different parts of the public. I certainly wouldn\u2019t rest a legal defense upon this description. But there\u2019s no reason to invite regulation unnecessarily, or even lump ourselves fully in \u201cfinance\u201d when a \u201ctechnology\u201d moniker may engender more warm, fuzzy feelings than former. I 100% agree, though, that usage by a large or important segment of the population gives us a constituency to buffer against regulation. I also am a strong advocate for us demonstrating a good faith effort in complying with regulations that we actually think may cover us. It\u2019s important we present ourselves as a benevolent addition to finance and are important enough to have a seat at the table to comment on regulatory pressures when they inevitably occur. ",

[BTC as Legal Tender]\u2026I\u2019m half-kidding\u2026(https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/06/bitcoin-el-salvador/)     PaperImperium:  The statement you made is not incorrect. The thing to remember is that the SB does not represent whether Maker is solvent \u2013 it represents cash on hand.   This has been a fun exercise. Thank you @SebVentures for posting the accounting reference. I have to agree with @PaperImperium that the SB can be viewed as cash on hand, more closely resembling working capital rather than retained earnings. R/E passed on MKR holders in the form of a burn event, SB equaling an asset, cash reserves, to meet the demands of operations and its other liabilities. ",
