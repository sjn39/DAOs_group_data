Work Being Done Since the launch of the CU, we have added a ton to our public drive. Supporting documentation around all our active projects is growing with project plans/descriptions, metrics tracking, and workflow process docs coming into existence and being iteratively improved upon.  Meetings at Maker, The Call Calendar We are continuing to formulate a vision for meetings and coordination at MakerDAO. Currently we have a public call calendar that anyone can subscribe to. We are putting together documentation for what this calendar will be. The vision is to give permissions to select Facilitators and key team members who are leading various initiatives and sub initiatives to be able to schedule public calls with strict invite lists as well as calls with open access. This will be key for improving visibility and feedback opportunities for stakeholders of all types.  Translations Carrying forward the legacy work of some community development team contributors, our team has continued to fund translations of select publications into Spanish. We held a meeting with the content production team after our former meeting with the contributor team in order to help bridge their work to a Core Unit with the appropriate mandate to house the work. Content Production is piloting an ambassador program that includes translations for content. Handoff nearly complete   Stakeholder Database We are in the process of reviewing and solidifying a deal with legal counsel that specializes in global tech GDPR compliance. Soon after we will begin work to bring our practices up to a standard that ensures the protection of collected stakeholder data.  Information Output Audit Thomas has completed a written report of the first findings of the Audit. We shared it prior to our very first Status Update call, which happened Nov 11th and had a handful of attendance from facilitators and representative team members. The video can be found on our drive here. The next step for the audit is checking in with each Core Unit Facilitator to capture their feedback on the audit findings. If the Core Units agree with the findings, then the next step will be to finalize the audit and set a timetable for completing each recommendation.  Issue Discussion Calls We created a draft of the process documentation for coordinating and organizing these calls. The next call is being planned.
