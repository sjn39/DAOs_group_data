This MIP Amendment only affects Signal Requests leading to non-standard weekly polls and doesn\u2019t change the standard and primary focus of MIP16.   Amended MIPs and Components  MIP16  MIP16c1 (Add the following bullet points)  To protect the integrity of existing MIPs, Signal Requests are only permitted when they are specifically triggered and required by an existing MIP. This component explicitly forbids the possibility of community-triggered Signal Requests about arbitrary issues. It is also explicitly specified that the only way to make arbitrary changes to Maker Governance is through the full MIPs process or through Governance Mandates of Mandated Actors.

This MIP amends MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle by adding two bullet points to MIP16c1. This proposal intends to override community-triggered Signal Requests (community actions resulting in non-standard Weekly Polls) by making them specifically limited to existing provisions in MIP process. This means that Signal Requests that are not specified in a ratified MIP will no longer be permitted. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

Isn\u2019t that putting much centralization and liabilities in the hand of facilitators (my concern being more on the liability side)? Removing the ability to have a non-standard weekly poll (initiated by a facilitator) make them deciding by themselves to add something to an executive? It\u2019s no longer facilitating decision making but deciding to me. Let\u2019s say I think adding changing the investment mandate of MIP65 to shorter duration risk (or increasing exposure) might be a good idea. I need to lobby to a facilitator that will make the call to include it to an executive? How is the discussion taking place in public and how are the MKR holder associated in this discussion? If there is a second order negative consequence how can a facilitator say he was only facilitating? To me I understand that MIP will increase the number of MIP (MIP being the new SR) and slowing down MakerDAO at a time where the Endgame plan wants to double down on RWA. ",

Meanwhile legitimate use of SRs are at the mercy of being randomly censored by sybils and really just too unpredictable and unfit for Maker at the size we have today. We must simply learn to operate with a slower and more predictable governance cycle for all our non-standard activities. ",
