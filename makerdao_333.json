                    "content": " Overview Maker Governance has passed several budgets that include payments of MKR to Core Unit members as part of a compensation package. It is not inconceivable that other expenses denominated in MKR may become apparent in the near future. Some of the current MKR vesting schedules may be seen on Makerburn. At present, there is no clear indication about what should be the source of the MKR used for these expenses. There are two main options to source this MKR:  Use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury - currently MakerDAO owns 83700.1 MKR that was transferred from the Maker Foundation. This is visible at the address: 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB  Mint new MKR using the PauseProxy  The purpose of this poll is to see which of these two mechanisms Maker Governance would prefer to utilise. This thread on the forum contains some discussion around this already and may make for useful reading.  Use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury  Pros  We already own this MKR - no requirement to mint new MKR or purchase it on the open market Does not inflate MKR supply - this MKR already exists, although it is currently locked.   Cons  Governance has previously demonstrated a desire to delay spending this MKR. See thread. Some community members have called for this MKR to be burned. See this thread and this signal request. Committing to using this MKR will likely prevent this to a degree.   Mint New MKR  Pros  Familiarises people within and outside the DAO with the concept of minting MKR. Further MKR minting has been suggested in some recent proposals. Preserves the amount of MKR which the DAO owns directly for future use.   Cons  Dilutes overall MKR supply, potentially decreasing the MKR/DAI ratio. Minting new MKR potentially carries some legal and/or regulatory risk.     Should we mint new MKR for expenses or use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury?  Mint New MKR Use Treasury MKR Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will run for two weeks until Saturday, November 27th. Following this, an on-chain vote will be held for MKR holders to confirm the decision. ",

                    "content": "Abstained because my answer is Neither. We should Make MKR vesting directly related to DAI net profits via having a MKR buy component. Example for illustration: lets say protocol makes 10M DAI net expenses during a 3 month period. We could take 5M and buy MKR and 5M to build surplus and then fund the MKR vesting.  Lets say MKR purchased averaged 5K/MKR (so we bought 1000MKR with the 50% DAI net and built the surplus with the other 50% DAI net). Lets also say only 500MKR was required for vesting during that 3 month period.  So we can do a few things.  Save the extra 500MKR for vesting when net DAI isn\u2019t sufficient to cover vesting schedule. Burn some fraction of the 500MKR and save the rest. Burn all the 500MKR  Let say 2000 MKR was required.  We fund the MKR compensation at 50% level and ignore deficits. We fund the MKR at 50% level and save deficits to be made up with MKR purchased later.  The above model is fully sustainable because  MKR vested is tied to net DAI profit completely aligning interests of people working with MKR holders.  (how much of this profit is set aside - many different ways to manage set this) No new MKR minting is needed for DSSVest. Automatically determines the vesting price because MKR was purchased with DAI. Allows a continuous purchase of MKR based on profits vs. some arbitrary SB level and directly related to DAI profits. MKR burn happens when there is excess MKR purchased beyond needed for vesting.  ",

However, there are multiple MKR vesting schedules that have already been accepted by MKR holders in the form of MIPs and these would therefore require a MIP amendment or entirely new MIP to change.   I have been suggesting something like the above ever since the first posts regarding compensating CUs with MKR but everyone seems to be hot on just giving MKR away and doing it unsustainably vs. creating a system that is sustainable out of the gate.    As with everything I figured it could be changed later once people \u2018came around\u2019 if they ever did. Appreciate the sentiment but would rather someone else who is being paid decide whether this idea is worthy of being driven down the governance road. I simply don\u2019t have the time to drive this stuff basically for \u2018free\u2019.   The basic concepts are outlined in the above. My goal has always been to try to suggest sustainable solutions to basic Maker issues.  Whether MakerDAO or anyone decides to work with me to bring them forward - well so far not many takers. Here is another example I have been waiting for @LongForWisdom to comment on before I even brought it forward regarding a general governance compensation model.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:   Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal.  Simple gover\u2026     and another set of comments on this in my delegate thread that isn\u2019t as clean as the above.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I voted yes to  Offboard USDT Collateral Types - September 27, 2021 .  I voted yes to  Community Greenlight Poll - SB-DDC (Solid Block Detox Digital Coins) - September 20, 2021 .  A comment here.  I agree with other delegates that I think how we are using greenlighting polls are such that in \u2018most cases\u2019 (see below) I am going to greenlight something so we can have this reviewed by CU teams before I am going to be able to say yes or no.   In general I think there is a productivity hazard here.  \u2026     Regarding this signal request because I have long been talking about the above I pretty much am going to abstain from these and let the DAO do whatever it wants to do with the existing vesting \u2018model\u2019.

MIP 54: DssVest      MIP 54: DssVest   The ability to mint and burn MKR as needed is already a core component of the system that allows for clean accounting of the supply.   Is it though? According the makers own website Maker only mints MKR when the Maker Protocol is running a deficit and the system debt exceeds a maximum threshold, MKR is created and auctioned for Dai in order to recapitalize the system  community-development.makerdao.com MKR Token  MKR is an ERC-20 token that is native to the Maker Protocol. I understand it is more efficient from a programming stand point to mint/burn MKR on demand however I do have concerns that it goes against Makers original mission statement. I\u2019m sure there are members in the community that would agree minting MKR should only be a last resort.      MIP 54: DssVest   @Zarevok , minting and burning MKR is a core component of the Maker protocol. When and how it is acceptable to mint MKR has indeed changed over time. We\u2019ve recently seen Governance vote to mint MKR as an ongoing incentive for core units - if that is still up for debate, it\u2019s probably worth a separate thread as this thread is specific to the mechanism for how to handle vesting.

MKR payments are to CUs, which also means quite a bit of MKR is accruing to vacant positions  The currently approved Core Unit MKR budgets, as far as I\u2019m aware, all share the same end goal which is the compensation of Core Unit members. In practice, the MKR will be passed on to the individual contributors as part of an overall compensation package. In that regard, I\u2019m unsure how what I said is incorrect but I\u2019m always happy to be told I\u2019m wrong; I may be misunderstanding your point here and I apologise if that\u2019s the case. The precise nature of how this happens is left up to the CUs themselves and you are right to state that several CUs have budgeted for vacant positions. PE is, so far, the only CU to have separate MKR streams for specific contributors. Regarding the \u201chow much MKR\u201d question - it\u2019s clearly very difficult to tell. As we\u2019ve noted, there are vacant positions, CUs that haven\u2019t submitted MKR compensation plans, and CUs that are yet to be onboarded so a lot of variables to consider and any answer is liable to be inaccurate. @Tosh9.0  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s correct. Aren\u2019t all MKR vesting arrangements paid out of the roughly 83,700 MKR in treasury? Moving MKR for anything BUT flops (which should be avoided at all costs) seems irresponsible.

I appreciate you\u2019ve suggested an alternative, but in reality a mechanism to link DSSVest to the open market would require a smart contract overhaul and a MIP amendment.

Based on the current signal request you can see their initial minting solution is not supported by the community. If we do not seek further clarity we are repeating the mistakes we made when governance approved the DSS Vest module in it\u2019s current implementation.

This isn\u2019t what happened. At the time they made their vesting proposal, there was no MKR in the treasury, so minting would have been the only way to pay the MKR according to the vesting details. This passed governance. They later built DssVest, and proposed that it be used to vest themselves and others MKR, this also passed governance. There was something of a breakdown in communication in that not everyone realized MKR would be minted to do this, and that\u2019s arguably our (GovAlpha\u2019s) fault for not highlighting it in the relevant executive copy. My assumption was that everyone would realize it would be minted as that\u2019s the only long-term sustainable policy for paying out vesting (because it works regardless of whether there is MKR in the treasury.)     omahalawyer:  Thanks for answering my questions @LongForWisdom and @mkrorbkr .

I understand that\u2019s something I should have raised at the time.   No problem, I think that is a good topic for a future discussion on how we want to handle this in the long term. But coming back to the right-now decision: The choice is between minting and taking from the treasury, if we do nothing, MKR will be minted when the vesting streams are claimed. ",

                    "content": "I think there are multiple unexplored options here. Given that MKR flaps have come back and the protocol has already burned 1.7K MKR (almost 3 months of vesting) I realized we can just use the treasury and burn.    We will exhaust treasury funds at some point - which will force governance to deal with the issue properly. For now: Given the fact, the protocol (even with current 1M/week surplus buffer expansion) is going to burn something like 75M DAI worth of MKR before the SB hits 90M, I noticed that even if MKR hits 10K we will have purchased enough MKR to cover vesting for the next year or two. So I am with you and to satisfy @LongForWisdom and GovAlpha I am going to end up supporting that MakerDAO take the MKR slated for MKR compensation out of the \u2018treasury\u2019.   Point here is at least at current run rate we have what 10-12 years (maybe 5 with current CU expense growth) until this source of MKR runs out and then governance will be forced to consider various options all of which will be related to changing the flapper to saving some MKR for compensation vs. burning it all.

I think at this point that is the right decision, but I believe the issue should be revisited sooner than 5 years from now - and instead have MKR for compensation purchased from the market.  Aside from what has been discussed it is easier to show actual compensation amounts/expense, and if there is an issue about affording such compensation it would be handled by generating additional income or cutting expenses or reducing MKR burn, rather than closing our eyes and printing stock from thin air.

Since we are currently burning a lot of MKR, and there is MKR in the treasury, then a more efficient equivalent solution would be to continue to burn MKR, and use the MKR in the treasury for vesting. Minting MKR for vesting is a worse alternative to either of these. However, in a future situation when MKR is not being burned, spending MKR from the treasury is essentially taking value from all MKR holders and putting it in the hands of the CUs. In the future, the return on investment that governance should require for vested MKR in terms of what the CUs deliver in exchange should be almost unreasonably high. It must be very strongly justified. ",
