Benzinga    Umee And MakerDAO Initiate Dai Into The Cosmos Ecosystem - Benzinga Umee brings Dai\u00a0(CRYPTO: DAI)\u00a0into the Cosmos (CRYPTO: ATOM) Ecosystem, in partnership with MakerDAO (CRYPTO: MKR).      As per the article, DAI was selected by Umee, as explained by the founder of Umee for the following reason: \u201cWe chose DAI because the results speak for themselves: it is a durable product that has survived many market downturns. This is because MakerDAO considerably overcompensates for systemic risk by requiring an over-collateralization of Ether and other liquid crypto assets while using an aggressive interest rate mechanism to reinforce the peg.\u201d Dai for the win!

Now what\u2019s special with DAI and why is it being considered to be a potential reviver of collapsed stablecoin\u2019s image. Well, unlike UST stablecoin, DAI has quite a good reputation as it\u2019s an overcollateralized stablecoin across the whole crypto market with a market capitalization of approx $6.9 billion. Although compared to the largest stablecoin and market leader Tether\u2019s stablecoin USDT, DAI is smaller in magnitude but what makes it special and significant is its whole different build and design.
