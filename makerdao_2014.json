                    "content": " SAS Spending Permission This is a poll to ask for the consent of recognized delegates to finance the operations of SAS CU for the months of December 2022, January 2023, February 2023 and March 2023 through funds in SAS Dssvest, Auditor and Operational wallet. We will budget according to our previous NewBear market budget suggestion and be in general very conscious with our spending. We\u2019ve returned funds to the DAO on November 10th according to the guidelines. The amount required is less than the leftovers after our old budget expired at the end of November 2022. We believe using these existing funds is the most pragmatic way forward, if you want to support our operations. We will submit a new budget for the March governance cycle. The budget will be tight to objectives and milestones related to endgame, which we will base on conversations with stakeholders. In case we don\u2019t receive the consent, there are 2 MIPs in RFC that can be used to either secure a DAI transfer from the DAO or to describe the offboarding of the CU. This request will be going up as a governance poll on Monday, thank you GovAlpha! @Recognized-Delegates  Background information After our budget renewal was rejected, SAS took the feedback of many recognized delegates seriously. We realized that after fulfilling the initial auctions roadmap, the DAO now has a working product that covers the required needs and should be maintained, but not extended. With a lot of new things that need to be built for Endgame, we believe that engaging in Endgame is a better use of our time and skills.  The new Objective SAS strives to become a trusted custom software development service provider for MetaDAOs. This is in accordance with the Endgame plan, where individual MetaDAOs will focus on providing value where they know best, without the need to specialize in software development Technical teams who have built deep Maker-specific knowledge can enable these MetaDAOs to accomplish their vision faster. Besides, it is important to ensure that there are requirement-engineering and quality-assurance processes for software development in place. Only then, MetaDAOs will be able to outsource software development reliably.  How Together with the other engineering teams, we will work on such a process in the next months, while actively supporting the development of Endgame products as good as we can. We believe that similarly to the Web2 world, every software service provider will have a slightly different positioning. SAS wants to offer both, smart contract and decentralized frontend, development services accompanied by infrastructure work. We believe that having such an integrated Full-Stack offering will be beneficial for MetaDAOs.  Sunsetting Auctions Besides, SAS will wind down auction-related work to an absolute minimum. We will keep ensuring that the services are working and up-to-date (e.g. for new collaterals). We will do final polishing of the documentation and package the Frontend into a Desktop App, so that the barrier to run the application locally is reduced to almost 0 (Download + Double-Click). ",
