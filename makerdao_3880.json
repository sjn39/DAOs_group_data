The purpose of the ESM is to mitigate two serious scenarios:  a critical bug that is too dangerous to share knowledge of widely or attempt to fix; and, a governance attack.  The ESM MCD was launched with was suitable to deal with the former, but it overlooked an important consideration for the latter. Namely, a malicious entity in control of the governance mechanism could steal all collateral even after shutdown via the privileged access of the Governance Security Module (GSM) to the core accounting contract (the Vat). The governance delay would have to pass before this became possible; however, with the delay of 48 hours that was in-place when the bug was discovered, Emergency Shutdown would not have reached completion before the malicious entity became capable of acting. Impact: Some engineering time was required to discuss and fix the bug. Root Causes: The primary cause was incomplete specification of the behavior of the ESM. Time pressures around launch and internal controversies contributed to this oversight. A particular point of confusion was that different individuals had different ideas about the purpose of the ESM\u2013though the README of the repository always contained mention of both use cases, concerns at the time of deployment were generally more focused on bugs than malicious governance. Allowing governance intervention after shutdown is desirable in the \u201cbug\u201d scenario, as it allows governance to work around bugs in the shutdown mechanism itself\u2013this took focus off of the danger of such an ability in a \u201cmalicious governance\u201d scenario. The ultimate length of the GSM delay was uncertain as well\u2013some thought it would eventually be longer than the time required for emergency shutdown to complete. Trigger: Use of the ESM in a \u201cmalicious governance\u201d scenario. Resolution: The ESM code was modified to revoke governance permissions on sensitive modules after shutdown. The updated ESM was deployed and integrated into the live system in the executive spell that added Liquidations 2.0. This spell executed on Apr 26 2021 14:02 UTC, fully resolving the issue. Detection: Discovered during internal discussions around the necessary upgrade of the End and ESM modules as part of MIP-45 (Liq 2.0) implementation. Action Items:     Action Item Type Owner (GH handle) Ticket     Create guidelines for specifying new modules and designing property-based tests. prevent kmbarry1 #596     Lessons Learned What Went Well  The bug was discovered before it became relevant in practice. The bug was discovered through internal review processes.  What Went Wrong  The ESM\u2019s intended behavior wasn\u2019t fully specified. The system was significantly vulnerable to malicious governance attacks for an extended period of time.   Timeline All times UTC. 2019-11-18: MCD system launched with the flawed ESM. 2021-03: internal discussions around replacing the ESM as part of Liquidations 2.0 reveal the issue (exact date uncertain). 2021-04-26 14:02: the spell installing the new ESM is cast, fully mitigating the issue.  Supporting Information Forum post disclosing the issue and fix:    ESM+End Module Upgrades and Disclosures Updates       As was previously communicated, the Liquidations 2.0 upgrade of the Maker Protocol requires an update of the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) and the End module.  With the extra scrutiny that these modules received for the LIQ2.0 upgrade, the Smart Contracts Domain Team discovered two latent bugs in their code base. An ESM issue was discovered a few weeks ago and planned for disclosure when the spell adding MIP45 and activating it for LINK-A became available for voting. An additional End module b\u2026     ",
