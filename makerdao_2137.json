Paragraph Summary MIP105 establishes the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework. This includes direct exposure by Maker Core to stablecoins, and, during the pregame, direct exposure to advanced RWA collateral types including offchain and onchain bond products and complex loans. All rules for Real-World Asset Collateral for the DAO are contained in this framework, including the procedures of the Real- World Asset Collateral Scope Framework Advisory Council.  Component Summary MIP105c1: Preamble Contains the Preamble to the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework. MIP105c2: Scope Framework Articles Contains the Scope Framework Articles for the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework. MIP105c3: Responsible Facilitators Contains details on the Responsible Facilitators for the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework. MIP105c4: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process Contains details of how the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework can be amended.  Motivation The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework is necessary to define the Scope as per the Maker Constitution.  Specification  MIP105c1: Preamble The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework defines the principles and processes related to the practical implementation of Real-World Asset Collateral allocation including direct exposure by Maker Core to stablecoins, and, during the pregame, direct exposure to advanced RWA collateral types including offchain and onchain bond products and complex loans. The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework is subordinate the Stability and Liquidity Scope and the Physical Resilience Scope.  MIP105c2: Scope Framework Articles  1: The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council  1.1: The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council definition The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework.  1.2: Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council membership management Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.   1.2.1: The Real World Asset Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.     1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be ecosystem actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope is covering.     1.2.3: The Real World Asset Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to 10.2.3.1:.     1.2.4: The Real World Asset Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Real World Asset Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.     1.2.5: The current approved Advisory Council Members are contained in 1.2.5.1A.   1.2.5.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Current list of Advisory Council Members:  N/A  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      1.3: Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council projects and funding The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.   1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Real World Asset Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Real World Asset Facilitators.     1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Real World Asset Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Real World Asset Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.     1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Real World Asset Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcribtion. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.   1.3.4: The Real World Asset Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.      1.3.5: The Real World Asset Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.   1.3.5.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:     Quarterly Budget (DAI) Method of Distribution Maximum Limit (DAI)     0 Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months 0     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      2: The Implementation of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework through Software The Real World Asset Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.  3: Real-World Asset Arranger management  3.1: Arranger definition Arrangers are Ecosystem Actors that specialize in sourcing, negotiating, structuring of, and reporting on, Real World Asset collateral types and maintaining and monitoring the underlying legal and operational real world structures used by the Maker Protocol. They must never be able to operate or influence the arranged legal and operational structure\u2019s asset operations after the structures have been built and assets allocated hereto, and may earn a fee based on such Arranger activities. Arrangers cannot be Asset managers and are not allowed to actively manage or operate Real World Asset allocations on behalf of Maker. Arrangers are approved directly by MKR voters, and all RWA collateral exposure must be structured by an approved Arranger.  3.2: Active Arranger management This section handles the logic of adding and removing Arrangers.   3.2.1: Arrangers are onboarded or offboarded based on a governance poll by MKR voters, that is initiated by the Real World Asset Facilitators if they deem it necessary. The active state of current approved Arrangers is maintained in 3.2.1.2A.   3.2.2.1: In case of significant legal, regulatory or popular fear, uncertainty and doubt connected to an approved Arranger, the Real World Asset Facilitators must propose a governance poll to designate the Arranger as deactivated. A deactivated Arranger cannot onboard new structures, and their existing structures must be examined to determine whether it is feasible and affordable to shift their exposure to a different structure. Once the fear, uncertainty and doubt conditions have passed, the Real World Asset Facilitators must again propose a Governance Poll to reactivate the Arranger.   3.2.1.2A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of current active Arrangers:  Monetalis Blocktower  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      3.3: Arranger standard fees Arrangers may charge at most 15 basis points per year in fees on top of other fees charged by the structure and the Asset Manager. The fee is applied to the total value deployed in the structure. For stablecoin Arranger services, Arrangers may charge up to 5 basis points. The fee is applied to the total amount of stablecoins that Maker has exposure to, that the arranger is providing Arranger services for.  3.4: Arranger concentration risk management The Maker Protocol may not have more than 60% exposure of its Real-World Asset collateral to the structures of a single Arranger. In cases where for practical reasons there are not enough Arrangers able to allow Maker Governance to fully deploy its collateral in order to optimize the yield earned, the concentration requirement can be temporarily exceeded. This number must be continuously reduced, and the Real World Asset Facilitators must take action to search and propose onboarding of additional Arrangers when it is economically feasible to do so.  3.5: Arranger attestations and stress tests Arrangers must publish quarterly reporting on each structure they have arranged, and must alongside the reporting publish stress test analysis that shows how the structures would perform based on historical financial crisis scenarios and other example scenarios. The Real World Asset Facilitators must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Responsible Facilitators must propose a governance poll for warning, temporarily deactivating, or permanently offboarding the Arranger and/or the Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.  3.6: Arranger external legal counsel fee support The Real World Asset Facilitators have a budget available to pay legal costs related to legal research and first time setup of legal structures for arrangers. Arrangers that are supported this way must publish all research and conclusions related to the structure, to help other arrangers replicate the work and strengthen the Maker Arranger ecosystem.   3.6.1: The Arranger external legal counsel fee support budget is described in 3.6.1.1A.   3.6.1.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 The Arranger external legal counsel fee support budget is: Up to 1,000,000 DAI available per year. The full amount is immediately available at the start of the calendar year, and parts of it can be paid out through executive vote bundling when requested by the Real World Asset Facilitators. \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4     4: Asset Managers  4.1: Asset Manager Definition Asset Managers are Ecosystem Actors that actively manage and deploy capital allocated by the Maker Protocol into a trust structured by an Arranger. Asset Managers are chosen by Arrangers, who must present the Asset Managers alongside the other details of new RWA deployment opportunities that they propose to Maker Governance.  4.2: Asset Manager current information Asset Managers are not directly onboarded by Maker Governance, but are instead indirectly onboarded if they participate as Asset Managers in an arranged structure proposed by an approved Arranger and approved by Maker Governance. High quality, detailed, current and transparent information must be made available about all Asset Managers directly in the Real-World Collateral Scope Framework.   4.2.1: The list of active Asset Managers is maintained in 4.2.1.2A.  4.2.1.1: In case of significant legal, regulatory or popular fear, uncertainty and doubt connected to an Asset Manager, the Real World Asset Facilitators must propose a governance poll to designate the Asset Manager as deactivated. A deactivated Asset Manager cannot be involved in new structures, and their involvement in existing structures must be examined to determine whether it is feasible and affordable to replace them. Once the fear, uncertainty and doubt conditions have passed, the Real World Asset Facilitators must again propose a Governance Poll to reactivate the Asset Manager.   4.2.1.2A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of active Asset Managers:  Blackrock \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4       4.3: Arranger and Asset Manager negotiations Arrangers must negotiate RWA deployment opportunities with Asset Managers, and when the terms of a deal is fully negotiated, bring the deal to Maker Governance to consider. Arrangers must not have any conflict of interest with Asset Managers, and must always strive to deliver the best possible terms, with an emphasis on maximizing the yield earned by the Maker Protocol after all fees and other costs, while ensuring legal structure and financial risk is minimal.  5: Implementation of Real World Asset Stability Collateral  5.1: Definitions This Article covers how the collateral allocation rules for Stability Collateral defined in Stability and Liquidity 3.2 is practically implemented with Real World Asset constructs.  5.2: Implementation of Real World Asset Stability Collateral This section the Active Elements that define specific Stability Collateral and its risk parameters.   5.2.1: Cash Stablecoin Implementation. The Maker must target an exposure to Cash Stablecoins equivalent to 10% of the total Effective Circulating Dai supply. The breakdown of approved Cash Stablecoins and their individual parameters is described in 5.2.1.1A. The Real World Asset Collateral Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved Cash Stablecoins and their targets if they deem it necessary.   5.2.1.1: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Active Cash Stablecoins and their parameters:     Cash Stablecoin Effective Allocation Stability Fee     GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.01% 100 million Effective Allocation (As GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.01% contains 50% Dai this is implemented as up to a 200 million Debt Ceiling, but the Effective Allocation for the ALM model counts only as 100 million) 0.06%   USDC PSM 100% of remaining Cash Stablecoin exposure after allocating to all other Cash Stablecoins N/A     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4        5.2.2: Liquid Reserve Implementation. Maker must allocate all excess Cash Stablecoins to Liquid Reserves through an automated mechanism. The list of approved Liquid Reserve assets and their parameters is described in 5.2.2.1A. The Real World Asset Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved Liquid Reserve assets and their parameters if they deem it necessary.  5.2.2.1A  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Active Liquid Reserve assets and their parameters:     Liquid Reserve Effective Allocation     Coinbase Custody Rewards 100% of excess Cash Stablecoins     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4   5.2.2.2: A smart contract must move any excess Cash Stablecoin exposure into the Liquid Reserves, and must move any available Liquid reserves into Cash Stablecoins if the protocol is below its target Cash Stablecoin allocation described in 5.2.1.       5.2.3: Incubated Stablecoin Implementation. Maker may maintain a limited allocation to Incubated Stablecoins chosen by Maker Governance for their long term strategic value, if they meet specific requirements. The breakdown of approved stablecoins and their individual parameters is described in 5.2.3.3A. The Real World Asset Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved Incubated Stablecoins. The Real World Asset Facilitators can directly modify the listed parameters based on the calculations described in the subclauses to 5.2.3.   5.2.3.1: Incubated Stablecoins can receive at most a 200 million Debt Ceiling.   5.2.3.2: To mitigate reverse concentration risk Maker may at most make up 50% of the total supply of a Secondary Yield Stablecoin. The Real World Asset Facilitators must periodically update the effective Debt Ceiling parameter in 5.2.3.5A based on this calculation and following the update, bundle modifications to the live parameters in the Maker Protocol to be in line with 5.2.3.3A in the weekly executive votes. The frequency of these changes are decided by the Real World Asset Facilitators based on the magnitude of change, the risk posed by the change, and other factors such as their current workload and bandwidth of Maker Governance.   5.2.3.3: To be eligible for any debt ceiling, Incubated Stablecoins must pay a marketing reward, or other type of reward, directly as Dai to the Maker Surplus Buffer or through a legal structure, that results in a net income to Maker equivalent to at least 1.9% per year of the allocation to the Incubated Stablecoin.   5.2.3.4A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Approved Incubated Stablecoins and their parameters:     Incubated Stablecoin Debt Ceiling (DAI) Yield Weight     USDP PSM 0 0%   GUSD PSM 70 million 2%     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      6: Implementation of Real World Asset Yield Collateral Allocation  6.1: Real World Asset Yield Collateral Definition Real World Asset Yield Collateral is low risk collateral optimized for yield by a Protector Advisor Ecosystem Actor. It plays the role that Protector SubDAOs will eventually do in Endgame.  6.2: Protector Advisor Management and relative Allocation Protector Advisors are Ecosystem Actors approved by Maker Governance that each are delegated advisory responsibility for a part of the Real World Asset Yield Collateral. They are tasked with advicing Maker Governance on the optimal way to deploy their delegated allocation. The total allocation of Real World Asset Yield Collateral is evenly split between all active Protector Advisors during the Pregame.   6.2.1: The Real World Asset Facilitators can propose to add or remove Protector Advisors if they deem it necessary, by submitting a Governance Poll. Protector Advisors and their Protector Advisor Relative Allocation (PARE)s of the Protector Real-World Asset Exposure are listed in 6.2.1.1A. Protector Advisors are identified by their registered Ethereum Address.  6.2.1.1A:  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 List of Protector Advisors and their Protector Advisor Split:     Protector Adviser ETH Address PARE     Spring TBD 50%   Viridian TBD 50%     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4   6.2.2: Protector Advisor teams must monitor the allocation available to them and provide advise about favorable opportunities for allocating Real World Asset Collateral. The Real World Asset Facilitators must review these opportunities and may choose to allocate funding for the technical implementation, or request support from other Facilitators who must reasonably fulfil such requests. When Real World Asset Collateral allocation opportunties are ready to fully implemented, they must first be brought to a Governance Poll in the weekly governance cycle for collateral onboarding, followed by an Executive Vote, at a reasonable pace.    6.3: The ALM breakdown of Protector Advisor collateral allocation Protector Advisor collateral allocation must follow the following constraints:   6.3.1: ALM Tier 1. The Protector Advisor can provide advice on allocations of up to (80% * PARE) - (existing ALM Tier 1 or higher allocation for the Protector Advisor) - (existing ALM Tier 1 or higher Protocol allocation * PARE) of new Yield Collateral of ALM Tier 1 or higher.     6.3.2: ALM Tier 2. The Protector Advisor can provide advice on allocations of up to (65% * PARE) - (existing ALM Tier 2 or higher allocation for the Protector Advisor) - (existing ALM Tier 2 or higher Protocol allocation * PARE) of new Yield Collateral of ALM Tier 2 or higher.     6.3.3: ALM Tier 3. The Protector Advisor can provide advice on allocations of up to (50% * PARE) - (existing ALM Tier 3 or higher allocation for the Protector Advisor) - (existing ALM Tier 3 or higher Protocol allocation * PARE) of new Yield Collateral of ALM Tier 3 or higher.     6.3.3: ALM Tier 4. The Protector Advisor can provide advice on allocations of up to (12.5% * PARE) - (existing ALM Tier 4 or higher allocation for the Protector Advisor) - (existing ALM Tier 4 or higher Protocol allocation * PARE) of new Yield Collateral of ALM Tier 4 or higher.   6.4: Approved types of Protector Advisor Real World Assets Protector Advisors can only asses and advice on Arranger structures that enable allocation of Dai Collateral to asset types defined in this section.   6.4.1: US Government Treasury Bonds, Notes and Bills.     6.4.2: Money Market Instruments defined as investment-grade, highly liquid, short-term debt instruments that can be exchanged for cash within 5 business days. Allowed Money Market instrument types include: term certificates of deposit, interbank loans, money market funds/ETF, commercial paper, Treasury bills, and securities lending and repurchase agreements (\u201crepos\u201d).   6.5: Protector Advisor reports and stress tests Protector Advisors must publish quarterly reports for their total Protector Advisor allocation, and must alongside the report publish stress test analysis that shows how their total Protector Advisor allocation would perform based on historical financial crisis scenarios and other best practice example scenarios. The Real World Asset Facilitators must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the reports and stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Real World Asset Facilitators must propose a governance poll for warning, temporarily inactivating, or permanently offboarding the Protector Advisor and/or the Arrangers and/or Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.  7: Implementation of Clean Money  7.1: Clean Money Real-World Asset exposure restrictions As defined by the Maker Constitution, Maker may not have exposure to Real World Assets that directly finance coal use for energy or electricity production. This does not apply to metallurgical coal or other usecases of coal where a lower-carbon substitute is not available.  8: Legacy Real-World Asset Vaults  8.1: Legacy Real-World Asset Vault definition Legacy Real-World Asset Vaults are RWA vaults that were onboarded prior to the Maker Constitution, and that are not adopted into the RWA Scope Framework by being compatible with the specifications in it. They are not counted in the main rules and processes, except for their influence on the ALM model due to their duration risk, where they are considered a form of Protocol Exposure. They must be offboarded when it is reasonable to do so, considering the yield they provide compared to Yield Collateral of the same ALM Tier, and considering all other relevant economic and reputational factors. This article must be updated to contain the exact conditions and practical steps to execute the offboardings.   8.1.1: In case that important changes must be made to the Legacy RWA structures to ensure they keep functioning correctly before they are offboarded, the Real World Asset Facilitators must propose these changes through a Governance Poll.   MIP105c3: Real World Asset Facilitators The Real World Asset Facilitators of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.  MIP105c4: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process During the pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.

                    "content": "My understanding is that the first article is common across (some or all of?) the scope frameworks. If this is indeed the case, I would recommend that it be defined once in a single place, rather than replicated across multiple documents. Given each framework can be modified individually, you run the risk of slightly different processes being used in different scopes. This could be good, if there are scope specific concerns that justify a modified process. On the other hand having several close-but-not-identical processes across the scopes will inhibit understanding among participants and may lead to unintentional errors if participants accidently apply one scopes process to another. As I know this is replicated a bit. I\u2019ll start on comments for article 1.     rune:  1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member.   Who has voting rights in this vote? Just the responsible facilitators, or the entire advisory council?     rune:  The current approved Avisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element 1.2.5.1.   Might be cleaner to just have this refer to a separate MIP component. You could potentially also record the process as a separate component as well. So long as the MIP-as-a-whole has the same barriers to modification as the scope article component, there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with this.     rune:  1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.   Do MKR Holders have any process to remove advisory council members absent a vote triggered by the responsible facilitators? As written, I think the answer is no. Should MKR Holders have this power?     rune:  1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.   I think I catch the idea here, but as worded it is a bit confusing. Is there any way it can be made more clear?     rune:  1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcribtion. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.   The statement \u2019 The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework.\u2019 prohibits the council from doing so, which I don\u2019t believe is the intention. The idea as I understand from context is if they don\u2019t produce work in that format, someone else can fix the formatting for them. Suggest:  1.3.3: The Advisory Council is not required to produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.  I\u2019m actually not sure this is a good idea though. If they are a member of the advisory council and they\u2019re being paid, maybe they should produce work in a format we can use directly? If they don\u2019t, there is the potential for unintentional mismatch between work produced, and what ends up in the scope framework.     rune:  1.3.5: The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value   It\u2019s extremely hard to measure \u2018high probability of producing clearly measurable value\u2019.     rune:  and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.   Forum structure is not optimized for long-term storage and retrieval of information. This is the reason that we have a MIPs portal rather than just storing MIPs solely on the forum. Suggest that the actual information as to what\u2019s being spent and why is recorded somewhere more durable and accessible. A github repo, potentially mirrored to IPFS, ideally viewable using something mips-portal-adjacent. Discussion on said proposals should then take place on the forum, though potentially as a \u2018roll-up\u2019 post in which all transactions over say the next month are summarized and may be discussed if there is interest.     rune:  The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter.   Just to double-check intent. The intention is that the facilitators alone have control of this budget, rather than the advisory council as a whole?     rune:  It is accessible as a keg that refills at a linear rate of 0 per 3 months, and has a maximum limit of 0.   To confirm, this is distinct from the existing DSSVest implementation in that it implemented no end-date and instead a Dai-cap? In practice the \u2018maximum Dai limit\u2019 is not particularly enforceable, as the recipient can make sure to always pull the full budget prior to the cap being reached. This is pretty hard to object to as \u2018malicious\u2019 as well, given that the budget has been explicitly approved by governance. Like, assume I\u2019m the responsible facilitators in charge of the budget. I won\u2019t do reckless spending, because that\u2019s prohibited. However, the budget directly gives me the power to fulfil my mandate and \u2018look good\u2019, why would I ever voluntarily limit my own budget, when instead I can stack it up in a multi-sig in case I need it in the future. Empirically, this dynamic doesn\u2019t always play out, as multiple core units do return excess budget funds, however, there is a difference between:  Returning what you definitely don\u2019t need; and Not claiming something that you might need  As an altruistic actor, I would claim the maximum I could and return what I was sure I didn\u2019t need when I was sure I didn\u2019t need it. As a self-interested actor, I would claim the maximum I could and keep it until I could find something good to use it on (unless I felt the reputation for returning it outweighed the future value of retaining it.) As a malicious actor, I would claim the maximum and stack it in the multi-sig until it was worthwhile to attempt to collude to steal it. TL;DR, it\u2019s probably fine to just use DSSVest and refresh it once a year. Especially given that budgets may change each year anyway which would require replacement / adjustment of the keg solution. I guess if you are married to this implementation, add a rule stating responsible facilitators may only use keg funds to directly fund advisory councils for direct work, and may not use it for any sort of \u2018storage\u2019.

So in GUSDs case, I think the obvious answer is that if the problem with the hurt users is resolved then the issue should be much less severe, as I see it. Obviously in all cases there needs to be a lot more detail and just in general considerations like this needs as many example and hypothetical cases as possible that are thought through. One thing that I think is clear, and that we should also define clearly, is that just getting sued by regulators shouldn\u2019t count for much. Worst case scenario it could even bait regulators to sue companies, and in general the regulators are just very quick to sue. Overall I think it is quite clear that GUSD is in a very different place now that the earn users have been hurt (some would argue not due to the fault of gemini, but still connected to them), and that given we have other options including USDC and USDP then we don\u2019t lose anything from reconsidering the exposure for now, and can then consider next steps as we better understand the new status quo, or if the issue just solves itself. This kind of situation could easily repeat itself in the future and the more we have thought about it in advance the better we will be off when it happens again. ",

I agree with the approach shared here, but not the execution. These Scope Frameworks at this stage of maturity should remain at an Objective level, leaving Strategies and Tactics to Advisory Councils to define the execution through DLOs and capture learnings (if any) into the Framework itself later on. Operationally this means: do not write \u201cgrandfather\u201d existing deals in the Scope Framework. What should be written is the answer to the question WHY which is what @PaperImperium and @DaveringtonPLLC  mentions in their initial phrase. Why would we want to give a special treatment to current deals? We should treat the existing deals differently to new ones due to the fact that the Objective here is: to build long-term partnerships with Arrangers, EAs and SubDAOs who can leverage their expertise in each vertical while Maker Core remains at a higher level of hierarchy from a lender perspective. Nothing more. The grandfathering should be defined in a case by case basis through DLOs and experts that negotiate on behalf of the DAO each case, never as a blanket solution for all. Remember these 3 elements SubDAOs get:  SubDAOs get Maker Core Funding. Get a new governance token, voting framework, a governance framework. Get branding and legitimacy from Maker Core.  Maker Core, seems to be moving forward into becoming a d-Central Bank who only accepts the best collateral possible and nothing more than that, SubDAOs are the investment institutions / commercial banks who take further risks with lower quality collateral. Maker should remove from its balance sheet the lower quality collateral by leveraging SubDAOs, but SubDAOs also get already 3 elements for free. the paradigm has changed, the macro has changed, Maker Core strategic approach to collateral has changed. The rules are new and a new negotiation is due. If you just blanket grandfather current deal without changes we are giving all for free and keeping the lower quality collateral. again, we should just write:  Objective here is: to build long-term partnerships with SubDAOs the rest is a DLO and a work proposal with a negotiation.

Even for ETH, the markets aren\u2019t infinitely deep, and I\u2019d argue that some of the RWA collateral Maker has right now actually has far deeper liquidity. So the above requirement is undoubtedly achievable. Protector subDAOs can have much more esoteric and illiquid or hard-to-value collateral because they are isolated from a risk perspective. Even there, I want to suggest that they should not hold any collateral without a fully developed on-chain monitoring system. If the community is unable to verify valuations it sets Maker up for potential fraud, negligence and grift. ",

Yes, quite right! I hope and already suspect you are working this into the approach on MIP13c3-SP13. I note that     rune:  9.1: Legacy Real-World Asset Vault definition   has a very different posture than communications around the Declaration of Intent for RWA monitoring solutions so far may imply. For reference to readers:     Request for Proposals for a on-chain RWA monitoring solution Governance       Since MIP13c3-SP13 passed with flying colors, we request potential partners to submit proposals or intent and initial scope for proposals as an answer to this forum post.  Here\u2019s the original discussion for reference: MIP13c3-SP13: Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults - Maker Improvement Proposals / Formal Submission - The Maker Forum (makerdao.com)  To recap: MakerDAO intends to fund a comprehensive on-chain RWA monitoring solution that co\u2026     Are you converting the above effort over to the DAO-Level Objective framework you are working on? External communications on this are extremely important, and should adjust ASAP. The opportunity for interested parties is quite different for a suite of deals MakerDAO will essentially be freezing in place with the explicit intention to dismantle on a long-enough time horizon while also (potentially) modifying meaningfully in the shorter term. Comments from @0x3phemeralsoul on the Growth communications strategy for Endgame fit perfectly into this conversation. How the Scope Frameworks are developed in substance, and how the workforce is executing their day-to-day mandates need to be tightly integrated. Just going to copy paste the entire comment here because it\u2019s so ON POINT and important to double click on:    Endgame Communications Strategy & Plan - Community Feedback   Looking at the WIP scope frameworks there is a role called \u201cAdvisors\u201d. These roles are very important in the ecosystem as they are domain experts. As we know, not many web2 / tradfi experts are available in DEFI. If we need a set of advisors per scope framework, then the Comms strategy at this Chapter, needs to turn from Branding objectives and KPIs into Lead generation / performance objective & KPIs. In normal companies, the procurement team will tell you that to award a project you need to get a proposal from 3 providers and pick one of them. If we need 3 advisors per scope framework. The Brand and Growth team should deliver at least 9 leads applying for Advisors per scope framework, so the community/Facilitator can choose the best of the best. The above is REALLY important to achieve and Maker is not excelling on this at all. We haven\u2019t seen a line of \u201carrangers\u201d for ProtectorDAOs or CreatorDAOs submitting in the forum the will to launch. We need top of the funnel leads and communicate better. Branding is great for long-term, but the Endgame has a short time frame, we need performance focus delivery as well.   Further, as you comment below @rspa - it seems the pregame period should not focus so much on a comprehensive RWA monitoring solution since these deals and responsibility for reporting, transparency and risk management will not stay with MakerDAO Core. Instead, subDAOs will design and manage their own bespoke solutions - is that right? I fully agree the approach is an excellent way to get the best overall outcomes that also can scale.     rspa:  Which is great and should take place at the protector subDAO level were risk can be appropriately isolated.   Finally, on your reply re the role of protector subDAOs, if the pregame Constitutional approach is approved then speed in implementing highly strategic and impactful objectives would be undesirable. I\u2019d suggest that the work underway for MIP13c3-SP13 remain open and responsive to the new organizational structure that\u2019s forming, so the right parts of the ecosystem have input at the design and evaluation stage of any recommendations or proposals regaring monitoring and reporting solutions for Real-World Asset Collateral.

This is exactly what I\u2019m working on at the moment! The new DLO framework is perfectly suited for the intended solution and developing a DLO for the intended solution has already provided some valuable input for DLOs. I think monitoring is of tantamount importance for both Maker Core and the subDAOs. Maker Core might hold much more straightforward to monitor assets, but the overall need is the same, if not even more significant. As I stated earlier, off-chain collateral begins to be perfectly attractive as soon as it behaves like on-chain collateral. MakerDAO\u2019s smart contract system has proven more than able to weather even severe storms. This is what we want for off-chain assets too. Liquidations should work on autopilot. This is possible.

Which might be the best case for \u201creasonable\u201d and considering all relevant \u201ceconomic and reputational factors\u201d   Most don\u2019t gave a natural expiry. We usually do have a 90 day notice to stop new purchases or for the Centrifuge ones, just put the DC to 0 which gives the same result. But a few things to consider:  Blocktower have an expiration of 48 months (but then you have to dispose of the DROP), most vault haven\u2019t started to invest. Redwood is legacy but not even live yet! New Silver is in the process for raising the DC and getting an enhanced legal structure which incurs costs to them. HVB has only used 20-25% so far. SocGen is no longer drawing on the vault but obviously they want to move to the next step after this first experiment.  For most you might get locked up for 5 years, like for HVB we have shares of loans that are 5-years maturity (in this example we could sell the participation but unclear how that would work and would put a loss on Maker as rates have risen). Therefore we can work on a more precise picture (with actually unknown unknowns that we will only discover by doing it), but if governance wants to shut down private credit investments, it will take up to 5-years to clean things. I would say most of the exposure will be cleaned earlier but depend on when the order is taken. On the reputation, I would say years are in order. Nevertheless, if Maker wants to just invest in public credit instruments, there is less need of a reputation to start with. On the economic, I really doubt anyone made any money so far if you exclude lawyers and service providers. Everyone is playing for the long term of building traditional finance on top of DeFi. Most of the upfront cost are in the past, so it\u2019s mainly profit so far as long as there is not a default. I would recommend Maker community to have a serious discussion on what it is that you want to achieve and why. I\u2019ve personally be a proponent of public credit for quite some time against the mood of community at the time, so I approve the trend. Nevertheless, throwing everything out seems quite a strong decision. The current private credit book we have is fairly manageable (let\u2019s say 300-350M) and is actually yielding far above our average. On the priority list to improve MakerDAO, it seems very low. Moreover, private credit could be a strategic advantage in a few years. Both Blocktower/Centrifuge and Monetalis, the only current arrangers, are mainly private credit and their first, and only, private credit deals are already legacy (before being even deployed). As I don\u2019t understand what it is that community wants, I can\u2019t give better advice. Happy to continue to either innovate, monitor or offboard it at the speed that community wants. I would just ask to have some stability and clarity in the decision that is taken, if possible. PS: As public credit is getting more commoditized and on-chain, I would forecast it will go to Maker core in the future. I assume this scope will again be changed for a shift towards private credit or the protectors to be offboarded. ",

The work needs to focus on tokenization of real things in a manner where they can be provably directly owned and traded on peer-to-peer networks. Maker\u2019s ambition for RWA should extend to the broader society transition to a financial and capital markets infrastructure that is superior to the status quo in terms of safety, transparency, soundness, cost efficiency and auditability. Messaging around the Endgame should center on how the Endgame Era benefits the world by improving finance in ways policy makers and regular people care about. The changes proposed by Endgame, including aspects of anonymity and ossification must be understood to be for the benefit of the public and users of the system because they PROTECT the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. We are attempting to provide benefits that are entirely unique to blockchain infrastructure, and must take care that such actions are not misconstrued as attempts to evade the protections that laws and governments provide. Great comments by @Matt_NZ make a similar point about being outwardly focused on the overall impact/importance/relevance of the new system, while presenting the specific details of Endgame in a nested fashion within the high-level narrative.    Endgame Communications Strategy & Plan - Community Feedback   Maker reorientating in part towards an environmental and public good ethos will (or should!) drive some interest, likely more than the internal logistics of the Endgame reforms. If anything, I think this idea should be at the centre of the external communications strategy.   For specific discussion on what this kind of RWA Focus looks like, this entire thread by @brianmcmichael and in particular these comments from @christiancdpetersen should be reviewed by all:    Real World Assets as a Vampire Attack on Crypto   As having supported the integration of RWA with Maker since March 2021, I can say, with all honesty, that the current RWA program does nothing too interesting. I mean, the Delaware statutory trust is not, in any way, a new invention and real estate lending and loan participations are fairly standard. Even Wall Street has gotten into the \u201cClean Money\u201d thesis. Sure, I am proud of what we have accomplished with HVB and others, but it is not yet transformative. I think, however, that the above discussions truly miss a key feature of what Maker can achieve in the RWA space when combined with blockchain. IMHO - Maker should leverage its privileged position as the issuer of DAI to promote the digitization, financialization, and commoditization of new real world assets - assets that start digitally native, are tied to oracles (internet of things), and can, as a result of the first two, be more fungible. With DAI pegged to the US dollar, Maker can most assuredly create value on a geographically broad and inclusive basis given the wide-spread acceptance of the dollar. MKR should not be viewed as a low-cost source of capital. Frankly, that is the source of many of the issues surrounding RWAs - many projects view Maker as a low-cost of capital and as their ticket to start-up success or continuation as a business. I know this as a fact as I had, late in 2021, proposed MD Irradiance as a MIP6 applicant for construction-only solar finance (long-since put into hibernation since I thought I could add more value by supporting Maker directly). Maker has a privileged position in the crypto-space. It can choose to remain a niche-crypto product. Or it can leverage its position and create new value. I cannot conclude that new value creation equates to a \u201cvampire attack on crypto\u201d. And as President Franklin D. Roosevelt said during his first inaugural address in 1933 - [L]et me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is . . . fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\" We should harness Maker\u2019s position to advance . . . not retreat.

For instance, the current revenue from RWAs is largely derived from the US government. MIP65, ETF Bonds, MMFs, and USDC yields are mainly generated from the interest that the US Federal Reserve Bank pays on Treasuries and Excess Bank Deposits. Although this may be disheartening, it is the reality. However, this should not prevent Maker from utilizing these interest gains to do good; rather, it should be seen through different lenses. For example, pursuing yield from clean investments as opposed to treasuries may not be sustainable. Cryptocurrency on-chain investments need to emerge for a total shift away from relying on traditional finance structures but until they emerge we got to make the most of the collateral assets ",
