We should create and fund with 1-1.5M UNI a community-overseen organization that would finance existing and new political groups engaged in crypto policy/lobbying with the goals of 1) educating policymakers to preempt regulatory, legal, political, and tax threats to decentralized finance; 2) achieving regulatory clarity for decentralized finance and related activity; 3) advancing laws that support decentralized finance and decentralized governance; and 4) spurring other DeFi protocols\u2019 governance communities to contribute to the effort (through this organization or their own). In short, we propose to create a political grants committee (loosely modeled on the Uniswap Grants Program) with board members who are legal and policy experts, including lawyers from various leading DeFi projects. We propose a large amount of funding (between 2-3x the existing Uniswap Grants Program) because effective lawyers, lobbyists, and organizers are very expensive. They are also often specialized in different specific legal areas and specific jurisdictions or branches of government, so hiring a team of specialists is necessary. Further, an infusion of capital\u2014while less than 0.25% of the Uniswap treasury\u2013will enable the DeFi space to counter the massive spending from traditional finance players. The need for such an organization is urgent as governments around the world are awakening to decentralized finance and are rushing to regulate the projects without being properly educated on their benefits. Currently DeFi is not at the table\u2014but on the menu. New developments include reactionary tax, securities, and illicit finance proposals. These proposals are actively being considered in multiple countries and venues at the same time. This organization would help fund the education of policy makers to achieve more balanced legal frameworks around the world. It would be similar to a group of funders who founded the Media Democracy Fund in the early days of the Internet; it relied on experts to allocate funds across organizations advocating for a more decentralized and democratic internet. The Snap Poll will be live for 2 days, from May 27th until May 29th at 7:00 PM EST. If the poll passes with a minimum of 25,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the consensus check phase. A link to our snapshot proposal: Snapshot ",

A few points come to mind:   I think the scope of such an endeavor should be better defined. Will it advocate generally for DeFi? Will it focus on DEX related issues likely to be of greatest importance for Uniswap? Will it focus on the US primarily? Even the articulated budget is likely not big enough to address all global concerns, so there needs to be some prioritization. No doubt the committee would define this in more depth, but having some more clarity up front on these points would be helpful.   If the goal is more general, advocating as a public good on behalf of DeFi, then I feel strongly that this would be better as a consortium effort with other top DeFi apps, including the likes of Aave, Maker, and others.   In general, I\u2019m definitely intrigued by the idea, but am also hesitant to dedicate treasury funds to advance a diffuse public good without a direct tie back to how it benefits Uniswap, or thoughts on how we might cooperate with others on said public goods.

The question is what future for defi we want: do we want to have active governance over protocols that can be changed, upgraded, and secured over time or for Defi to be effectively prohibited (whatever that means in practice, it wouldn\u2019t be good)? Regulatory proposals like the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s draft updated guidance (intended to be finalized next month) for crypto essentially claims that there is always an intermediary where a financial service is offered. The scrutiny of DeFi is intense in jurisdictions all over the world, and it\u2019s only going to get more serious as defi gains adoption. The traditional financial services industry has always leveraged political engagement to secure advantages, and they will use that leverage against defi when it becomes a threat. Re the above comments, policy is always a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d situation. If UNI doesn\u2019t make the first leap, then which project will? If anything, UNI moving first will pressure other communities to act with us, and we don\u2019t have time to wait for them rn given the regulatory action we\u2019re facing. ",

While it is difficult to attack Defi from a technological perspective, it can easily be done through a political angle. This proposal provides a framework to develop strategies to counter this. It affords the Defi movement to be proactive instead of reactive. Am pretty sure we would have had bitcoin/crypto ETFs in the US and other parts of the world easily if these kinds of initiatives were taken earlier on. This is a step forward in the right direction. I look forward to seeing how this develops. ",

They will turn their attention to DEXs soon, and when they do, we need to make sure they\u2019re educated as to the benefits, so they approach regulation with an open mind. Lobbying government on novel and complex subjects like DEXs and DAOs, particularly subjects tied to all the baggage of crypto, will be very difficult and time consuming. I\u2019m happy to see the community is taking this seriously and I expect other DAOs will follow Uniswap\u2019s lead.   The lack of legal and operational clarity significantly slows Uniswap\u2019s development and we need to address it as soon as possible. DAOs and DEXs are cutting-edge organizational structures and there is very limited precedent to help the community understand how to operate, particularly when it comes to legal compliance. Lawyers don\u2019t have enough direction from policymakers/regulators to provide crypto companies with guidance on how to be absolutely compliant. We need folks working closely with governments around the world to push for clarity that allows Uniswap and its community to continue building without all the legal friction we currently encounter.   The price of not doing anything will be much higher. Think of what happened last week and how much any negative signal from the US or Chinese government can impact progress in crypto. ",

Ignoring for a second the arbitrary (and very high) amount of $ proposed in the poll, the fact that the funds of lobbying organisation would be traced back directly to our protocol is alarming to say the least. We are basically shouting as loud as we can to get regulators attention that way, and at the same time attracting political researchers and civil society groups that tend to raise flags about money used to nudge the democratic process. A nudging often driven by financial interests and a disregard for fundamental rights or issues affecting a small number of users. Let\u2019s also not forget that lobbying efforts are often seen under a bad light by the general public. Google is the biggest lobbying fund in DC with ~$22m in 2018. Followed by other big tech. Same in the European Union. And as someone who lives in the EU I can tell you how much these companies are hated by people for trying to influence Brussels. But let me constructive. What I would fund instead:   Educational content on regulations around the globe. Map out countries\u2019 regulatory landscape for users to be able to get summarised knowledge about their own jurisdictions\u2019 laws on crypto/DeFi, or lack thereof   Content on tax obligations.   Content on the implications of the decentralisation measures in place for Uniswap. E.g resistance to different levels of state or corporate censorship, if the happen.   ^^ All that is helpful political education for DeFi users.   And I believe it is much more needed than trying to shove narratives down the throat of regulators. Wanna raise money? Go to Gictoin, show what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019ve built already for crypto. Here you need stuff about Uniswap. It can be non-technical; political and educational. ",

Until this happens, I will not support the proposal moving forward. Relatedly, but not a priority, while the treasury is significant, DeFi protection would probably be better served as a coalition of treasuries supporting a superstar legal roster rather than just UNI footing the bill to still amorphous org. My hope is that once the snapshot passes, we will get more information but in the future, I hope this sets the precedent that more implementation details are provided upfront so we can have functional discourse before heading into a snapshot, then work out the more granular details later heading into a formal proposal.

We have received some level of interest/commitment from several qualified individuals who will be made public if this passes the snapshot. A project roadmap is important to us as well, but instead of organizing all the details ourselves we wanted to first incorporate more input from the community. That is what this snapshot period was meant to foster, and we have been taking careful note of common concerns and suggestions. The roadmap will be better defined in the next governance step. Ultimately we anticipate other DeFi protocols will join our efforts. However there is a significant first-mover advantage if Uniswap doesn\u2019t wait\u2013it would establish Uniswap as a thought leader and the most forward-thinking DeFi platform in an otherwise very competitive space.

All of a sudden, we could find ourselves seeing that the \u201clobby allocation\u201d would cost far more than we had anticipated. What good is it to plow through 30M worth of tokens to devalue the rest of them by a huge magnitude? Then, the impact would be truly more than 30M, it would be counted in billions and I do not think the token is ready to handle such things\u2026not at the current market valuation at least. The opportunity cost is too huge to consider. If UNI has a market cap 10x the current size and is more liquid, we can talk about allocating 1M-1,5M of UNI for lobbying.

With that said, this proposal is highly misguided and is a result of massive wealth creation in crypto of which these people are trying to grab a piece.  You start small in life, prove out your worth and then go from there.  Anyone asking for $30 million USD on the first shot is very likely \u201cnot in it for the tech\u201d to put it lightly. Its kinda like one of those $30 million USD ICOs in 2017 that all failed.  Look at the best DeFi products, they all started small and grew. Also, this Harvard group is run by students, likely none of which have practiced law and are generally unexperienced.  Just bc they have Harvard in the name u should not be impressed.  CoinCenter has done a great job to date and has not asked for anything close to this and its actually absurd and should be a giant red flag. Academics are generally out of touch with society that are slaves to their institutions.  The spirit of the proposal is right but it has so many red flags - this should not be the group to lead us to ultimate freedom.  This kind of $ should be spent on dev power, not lawyers.  Give $1 MM to CoinCenter and lets see what they do - no need to get academics involved. On a side note - this Harvard org stated they would make a proposal for the fee switch a few months ago and they never did it.  Never provided justification.  And now a bunch of students ask for $30 mill \u2026 lol Additionally, A16Z has way too much power when it comes to Uniswap and crypto in general.  hey have fiduciary duty to their shareholders and not the protocols, data integrity/privacy, etc.  They will dump on you - see Dfinity and Coinbase IPO as examples. Leshner is the purest ally we have in the Uni community.  Follow him to freedom. ",

                    "content": "Hi all, I am the founder of HODLpac - a community-governed political action committee created in 2020 to help elect candidates for the US congress that support the cryptoeconomy - and a team member at Boardroom - a startup building DAO management and governance tools for open organizations. I am very happy to see this proposal by Harvard Blockchain and Fintech Club for two reasons:   As @Miller, @stat57, and others have pointed out in above comments, there are many regulatory attack vectors that threaten DeFi - from tax policy to securities laws to illicit finance regulations. On top of that, DeFi\u2019s borderless nature means that these threats are multiplied by the many jurisdictions/nation states it touches. To ignore these threats would be a grave mistake. Organizations like Coin Center, the Blockchain Association, Chamber of Digital of Commerce, and more have done a good job representing crypto and DeFi\u2019s interests but pressure is building and more resources are needed to bolster our defenses.   I am a decentralized governance maximalist that believes wholeheartedly in the potential for communities like UNI\u2019s here to pioneer a new form of human/economic organization via DAOs. I\u2019m convinced - as I think many others here are - that we are all taking part in the early days of a historical and society-changing experiment. However, for this experiment to succeed in creating new forms of institutions, we will need to find ways to interface with legacy ones like governments (importantly, while maintaining our principles).   I support this proposal in broad strokes but would like to see some of the feedback given here incorporated in its next iteration. Specifically:   This type of political/policy grants committee should be administered in a way that reflects our values; namely, with accountability, community participation, and transparency. Tools like Boardroom, Tally, and others have been created to help facilitate community involvement and open governance. An organization like this one should leverage those tools, board members should be voted on and serve for limited terms, and community input should be incorporated as much as possible.   The proposal is correct that experts in this area are expensive, but the UNI/$ amount asked for here is quite high. As stated above, I believe that it is a worthy cause to commit funds to. However, this proposal should change the funding structure - and follow the lead of the several community grants committees that have sprouted up across the DeFI ecosystem - to unlock funding in stages based on community approval and performance goals.   We should quickly make simultaneous governance proposals in other major DeFi DAOs to, as @DCInvestor says, make this into a true public good on behalf of the industry as a whole. UNI is a leader in the space but there are others.   The goal for the organization/committee that comes out of this proposal should be to become a meta-DAO on behalf of the DeFi community to fund initiatives that will benefit us all. A new age trade association. Again, if we are true believers in what we are building then we should lean into the tools that we\u2019ve been developing. I look forward to watching this proposal evolve and would love to help in anyway I can. For those who are skeptical, I hope you will consider supporting this good-faith initiative if feedback is incorporated. ",

I was obsessed with blockchain way before I entered the banking realm. And that is actually what prompted my entrance into that industry. So that in moments EXACTLY like these, I can advocate and motivate for our side, from within, if they are proposing potentially dangerous regulations or are completely missinformed and may make a decision that effects our space in a negative way because of that misinformation. You would be incredibly surprised how little most of these people know. AND\u2026 That\u2019s why as representatives of defi we must empower ourselves by upvoting proposals like the one above.
