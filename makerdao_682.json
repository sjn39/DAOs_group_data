We would still vote each week to enable an opt-out of the standard SF change if there were unusual circumstances or if it appeared it was being gamed.  A standard schedule like below is in keeping with scientific governance and allows all market participants to plan effectively for their investing decisions and will ultimately increase Dai adoption. Based on past SF changes it could look something like this (would be good to vote on a few alternatives) : Dai Price: SF Change <0.96: +4% 0.96 - <0.98: +2% 0.98- <0.995: +1% 0.995 - 1.005: No Change 1.005- 1.01: -1% 1.01 - 1.03: -2% 1.03-1.04: -3%  1.04: -4%  ",

                    "content": "First of all, thanks for posting here, welcome to the forum.      latetot:  A standard schedule like below \u2026 allows all market participants to plan effectively for their investing decisions and will ultimately increase Dai adoption.   A couple of thoughts on this point.  It seems to me that the market should already be aware of the fact that the Stability Rate is variable, and based on the price of Dai. There is already the expectation (or rather there should be) that if Dai is dipping then the fee will increase, and if it rises, the fee will decrease. Having a defined way in which the fee will change doesn\u2019t really add much. The fee is still variable. While the fee is still variable, your argument is that if it is variable in a defined way, then it will appear to be less unpredictable. I can buy this to a certain extent, but the problem is that if unpredictable changes are what is required to keep the Dai peg, we will make those changes, regardless of whether it breaks this pattern. I worry that we\u2019d be setting ourselves up for more backlash when we inevitably have to go against this.   And some other thoughts:   A further issue is how we define the Dai price. Do we look at the 24h VWAP (volume weighted average price), a weekly VWAP? The state of the orderbooks? We\u2019d need to decide what the canonical price is for a given period.   Short term fluctuations also complicates matters, it isn\u2019t always correct to react to Dai being off the peg if it is caused by a sudden eth move. We could be 2% off the peg for a week, and this might be fine. How much time do we wait before we react?   Part of the difficulty in creating a system of defined responses is that we don\u2019t really understand what responses are warrented yet. We have some small idea based on experience, but it is incredibly hard to isolate variables that are causing Dai price changes. We could define a system that ends up just not being strong enough, or being far too strong and then feel commitment to what could be a flawed set of responses.   Making future commitments on rate changes also relies on MKR token holders honouring a previous poll. I am very unsure whether this would happen in practice, especially as any on-chain poll around this (or any other) issue is unlikely to see 100% turnout.   ",

I agree that the time interval for defining the Dai price is important- I think a VWAP over prior 72 hours would be sufficient.  We would obviously need to signal that the schedule is not fixed in stone and that in extraordinary circumstances it would be modified. Also- maybe every month or every 3 months, the schedule could be voted on again.  In this system, the weekly vote of MKR holders would be to deviate from the default change and otherwise the default change would be adopted (this may not be compatible with the current contracts).  I agree that we are still learning- but I think that implementing a defined schedule would help with the learning process rather than hinder it.  Also - I think we would get a better turn out of MKR holders if the vote was to implement a schedule rather than a weekly SF change. ",

We can only provide better tools and assume they will vote in their best interest. Unfortunately that might not always mean in their best long term interest? They could game the system for their short term gains? I did not really thought about it much, but in any case this is for another topic.   My take on this is that improving liquidity and increasing confidence of arbitragers (in the system) will significantly reduce time of peg being below e.g. 0,98.   ",

I\u2019d like to see a DAI/USD price with statistical variation of that price over the time (i.e. something like a 3 sigma error - ala 80% of the time it was in this range) since one has to look at this statically.   I think the changes need to reflect a change based on the current SF.   since a 1% change on a 20% SF is going to be vastly different than a 1% change based on a SF of .5%   I would alter the above to be as follows <.95 vote .95-.97 with +/-.01 to 3-4 sigma level: NewSF=OldSF x 1.5 .97-.99 with +/-.01 to 3-4 sigma level: NewSF = OldSF x 1.25 .99-1.01 with +/-.01 to 3-4 sigma level (80-90% of the time):  SF same 1.01-1.03 with +/-.01 to 3-4 sigma level:  NewSF=OldSF x .75 1.03-1.05 with +.-.01 to 3-4 sigma level: NewSF=OldSF x .5 vote Not entirely what to do if the volatility is higher  Probably trigger a SF vote.?   I have to think on this and look back to the data - since to my mind if the volatility is higher it probably means there are liquidity issues. Also I have no issue with narrowing to +/-.005 but think until the SCD->MCD migration wider limits will probably be a good idea. Honestly have to consider how close we are to the debt ceilings and factor in collateral value changes into such a beast. BTW:  In case people think these are \u2018out of control changes\u2019 consider that the valid operating bands can be set and if they are exceeded trigger a SF vote. ",
