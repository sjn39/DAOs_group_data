The initial forum discussion describing voting delegation can be found here: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/delegation-and-makerdao/9429  Features released   Addition of the delegates page https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates   Ability to delegate and undelegate MKR into a delegate\u2019s contract   Recognize a wallet\u2019s delegate contract   Ability to vote as a delegate   Creation of delegate\u2019s profile page   Dark mode   ENS name resolver (for accounts only)    Technical diagram  Untitled1408\u00d7783 87.2 KB   Known issues When you become a delegate, you can only operate as a delegate. You will not be able to vote with a vote proxy, for example. In the future, we will add capabilities for switching between your delegate and your normal account, but for now, this is limited in the UI. Of course, managing via the smart contract access is still possible.  Upcoming Releases In upcoming releases, the following features will be implemented:   Filtering and sorting of delegates   Inclusion of last voted date by a delegate   Navigate easily between delegates profile pages   Improving delegate profile information   Dynamic participation metrics   Export profile information   Testnet migration to Goerli from Kovan    Additional links   Release notes: https://dux.makerdao.network/Vote-Delegation-fd4779acd1ca4da78d12d4fda3a8dd5a   Support and feedback: https://discord.gg/AQwb5Sjncu   Governance Portal public roadmap: https://makerdao-dux.frill.co/roadmap   Verifying a delegated contract on Etherscan: https://www.notion.so/Verifying-a-delegate-contract-on-Etherscan-df677c604ac94911ae071fedc6a98ed2   ",

They just want to delegate quickly and go on to do other things. This will especially be the case if delegation is ever incentivized. To assist this group while preventing randomness I would like the following feature: Neutral Delegate: The neutral delegate option is just like another delegate except that any MKR delegated is divided evenly amongst the other delegates. This prevents lazy MKR holders from making a mess of the delegation process by just randomly selecting someone from the list. ",

                    "content": "Is an interesting idea. Is something that should be designed carefully because there are some edge cases.  The neutral delegate / or community vote, would not distinguish from recognized or shadow delegates. Because at smart contract level, all are the same. The amount should be distributed proportionally to the actual amount of MKR that those delegates already have. MKR can not be distributed evenly among all delegates because anyone could exploit this by deploying many new delegate contracts. The neutral delegate contract would be specially complicated for executive votes, because there are scenarios where the amount of MKR in the neutral contract would change between a delegate staking in an executive and the next delegate staking. So, it could impact differently on different votes. If the MKR was to be distributed among the delegates, that would mean paying a lot of transactions and that would be expensive. The alternative would be having a contract that votes proportionally to what all the MKR delegates are voting (based on their MKR amount). That also would be expensive to do and has edge cases.  Probably the best idea is to delegate your MKR in 3 or 4 different delegates if you are not very sure about what to vote on. If we had the governance layer on L2 it could be cheaper to do, but it is still pretty complicated. Probably people from the PE core unit can explain more about this.   Thanks for putting the idea on the table, we added it to our list of things to think about ",

So, it could impact differently on different votes.   Oh! I see the confusion now, you\u2019re imagining there would be a neutral \u2018forwarding / management\u2019 contract. I was picturing this without a contract, and just the UI splitting some MKR between x delegates.     rafinskipg:  If the MKR was to be distributed among the delegates, that would mean paying a lot of transactions and that would be expensive.   Yeah, this was my concern as well. The more divisions, the higher the cost.  I wonder if it would make sense to have buttons that do something like: \u201cSplit my MKR equally between the three lowest-weight recognised delegates (with metrics > x, not expiring in a month?)\u201d \u201cDelegate my MKR to the lowest-weight recognised delegate (with metrics > x, not expiring within a month?)\u201d Feels like that is maybe as close to lazy-safe as we can get?
