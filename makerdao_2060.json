Articles of Incorporation for Pinnacle Bank, Cogent\u2019s predecessor  Amended Articles of Incorporation and name change to Cogent Bank   Sentence Summary Cogent Bank, an FDIC regulated Florida commercial bank, proposes participating $100M of loans to MakerDAO\u2019s existing RWA Master Participation Trust, on the same terms and with the same legal documents as Huntingdon Valley Bank.  Paragraph Summary Cogent Bank is an FDIC regulated Florida bank with $1.2B of assets and a $28M legal lending limit. Cogent proposes participating $100M of loans to MakerDAO\u2019s existing RWA Master Participation Trust using the same Participation Agreement with the same exact terms as MakerDAO\u2019s deal with Huntingdon Valley Bank. Cogent and MaxStability will pay MakerDAO\u2019s legal fees. This transaction is an opportunity for MakerDAO to reinforce its strategic value for community banks by doubling Cogent\u2019s capacity to originate loans to existing and new customers  Motivation MakerDAO will benefit in many ways. This proposal:  Demonstrates (again) that MakerDAO can be strategically valuable to community banks. Garners an excellent risk-adjusted yield. Scales investment grade RWA that is originated by an FDIC regulated bank. Has the potential to scale quickly because Cogent Bank has a $28M legal lending limit. Increases geographic diversification of RWA because Cogent covers the southeast USA.  The proposed transaction will be strategic to Cogent insofar as it doubles the Bank\u2019s capacity to originate loans to existing and new customers \u2014 this is MakerDAO\u2019s value to community banks.

Pinnacle Bank had $72M of assets at the time of acquisition and today, four years later, Cogent Bank has $1.3B of assets. That growth has happened organically (loan origination) from experienced leadership and dependable operations, as evidenced by negligible loan losses of less than 0.01% of assets over the same period. In 2019, Cogent originated $300M of loans. In 2020, originations grew to $513M. In 2021, volume grew to $873M. In 2022, through the end of August, Cogent had originated $602M.

Ratings 1 through 5 are \u201cPass\u201d ratings, and the rest, 6 through 9, are \u201cCited\u201d Cogent\u2019s Algorithm For Calculating a Loan\u2019s Risk Rating: Weighted Asset Risk Evaluation (WARE) Cogent calculates the risk rating of each loan using a methodology called the Weighted Asset Risk Evaluation (WARE) which is structured to reduce subjectivity from the credit grading process by setting objective rules for choosing a score across criteria categories. There is an algorithm whereby the score for each category is weighted in the final grade calculation. For more information about the WARE algorithm, see here.  MIP95c3: The Proposed Transaction and Terms  MIP95c3.1: Transaction Legal and Financial Structure (Replication of HVBank Structure Cogent proposes using the same terms, the same legal structure, legal documents, and financial structure that MakerDAO is now using with Huntingdon Valley Bank. Using that structure, Cogent will participate loans to the RWA Master Participation Trust (\u201cMakerTrustDE\u201d). The value in replicating the HVBank structure and using the same documents is:  Replicating what has been done before minimizes the risk to MakerDAO of doing something brand new. In particular, it eliminates MakerDAO\u2019s reliance on anyone to negotiate new agreements. Further, it makes the proposed transaction simple to close quickly. Most importantly, replication reinforces a standard model for transactions with American commercial banks, which MakerDAO can use to scale RWA with many banks.   MIP95c3.2: Proposed Debt Ceiling, Long Term Capacity, and Balance Sheet Management (Scaling Up and Scaling Down) Scaling Up Cogent proposes an initial Debt Ceiling of $100M, and over the next 24 months, Cogent can participate $250M to $1B in loans that conform to these terms. Scaling Down If and when MakerDAO seeks liquidity on a loan prior to the loan\u2019s maturity, we anticipate that MakerTrustDE will get liquidity in an amount and with timing dependent on market conditions. Cogent cannot agree in advance to buy back any loan.  MIP95c3.3: Minimum Net Yield to the Trust  (lifted from Annex I of HVB-MakerDAO Master Participation Agreement) The Loan shall be eligible for purchase if the interest yield, as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the day Seller (Cogent) sends the Participation Certificate related to such Loan to Buyer (RWA Master Participation Trust) and Calculation Agent (\u201cParticipation Send Date\u201d), meets the following thresholds:  For floating-rate loans, the minimum interest rate less servicing fees shall be greater than or equal to 75 basis points in excess of the thirty (30) day average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as published on the following website: SOFR Averages and Index Data - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK ; or  For fixed-rate loans, the minimum interest rate less servicing fees shall be greater than or equal to the like-term US Treasury Par Yield Curve Rate (as published by the US Department of the Treasury on the following website: Interest Rate Statistics | U.S. Department of the Treasury) plus 30 basis points.  This formula shall be expressed as: LOAN RATE \u2013 SERVICING FEES >= BENCHMARK + SPREAD  MIPc3.4: Loan Eligibility Criteria (lifted from Annex I of HVB-MakerDAO Master Participation Agreement) All Loans shall have been originated or purchased by Cogent (i) in its ordinary course of business and in all factors shall have complied with the Cogent\u2019s credit policy and loan origination guidelines then in effect and (ii) in no way that is more restrictive than the regulatory or supervisory limits that are required by the Cogent\u2019s primary state and federal regulators. The proposed terms for the Participation Agreement (the same as with Huntingdon Valley Bank) are:  Cogent will retain a minimum of fifty percent (50%) ownership in the principal of the Cogent participated loans. Cogent and MakerTrustDE shall have a pari-passu relationship in each participation. All loans must be assigned a \u201cPass\u201d credit rating by Cogent Bank. For loans that include a fixed rate period, said fixed period shall not exceed five (5) years. Cogent shall be the servicer.  To be eligible for participation (lifted from Annex I of HVB-MakerDAO Master Participation Agreement):  Loan is currently in good standing with Cogent Loan was made according to Cogent\u2019s approved credit and loan policies Properly collateralized and secured (as evidenced by the customary agreements and filings for the creation of a security interest if collateralized), with collateralization calculated as:  Loan principal / Appraised value < Maximum allowable LTV per asset type For stabilized commercial real estate loans, non-investment real estate business loans and equipment secured loans, the denominator \u201cAppraised Value\u201d will be the \u201cas is\u201d appraised value. For construction loans, the denominator \u201cAppraised Value\u201d will be the \u201cas renovated\u201d appraised value.  Satisfactory cash flow coverage of loan payments (for new construction, satisfactory payment plan during construction and satisfactory pro forma cash flow based on underwriting of the subject property and market fundamentals following completion), with Cogent providing its methodology for, and its calculation of, Debt Service Coverage for each loan as contemplated for each asset type below. For loans that include a fixed-rate period, said fixed period shall not exceed five (5) years (without regard for the overall term of the loan). No events of default are continuing No loans to insiders or other person prohibited by Regulation O. All loans meet standard compliance measures and searches.   MIP95c3.5: Loan Servicing Cogent will perform the loan servicing in accordance with a Servicing Agreement that is the same as the Servicing Agreement with Huntingdon Valley Bank. In the event of a Borrower\u2019s Default, Cogent will manage a workout (as \u201cSpecial Servicer\u201d) and is capable of liquidating the collateral so that loan principal is paid back to the RWA Master Participation Trust (and to Cogent).  MIP95c3.6: Uninvested Funds Cash sitting in MakerTrustDE will be invested in a money market such as SDIT Treasury II Fund Class F (SCPXX)  MIP95c3.7: Special Purpose Vehicle, RWA Master Participation Trust The special purpose vehicle (SPV) proposed is an existing Delaware Statutory Trust for the benefit of MakerDAO, the RWA Master Participation Trust, which is Administered by a regulated corporate Trustee in Delaware, Wilmington Savings Financial Society (WSFS). The Trustee is a bank that is well capitalized and WSFS carries insurance such as Directors and Officers insurance and/or errors and omissions insurance. This Trust is a Directed Trust, and the Trust Sponsor which provides this direction is an entity that seeks its own direction from a committee appointed by MakerDAO. The Trust Sponsor has limited administrative and commercial decision-making power, and material terms in the Masters Participation Agreement cannot be amended without the affirmative vote of MakerDAO \u2014 as verified by the Delaware Trustee (acting as the \u201cVerification Agent\u2019').  MIP95c4: Legal Fees, Governance Fee, and Servicing Fee  MIP95c4.1: Legal Fees MaxStability and Cogent will pay whatever legal fees are needed to prepare the documents, engage service providers, and consummate this transaction.  MIP95c4.2: Governance Consulting & Reporting Fee MaxStability LLC (\u201cMaxStability\u201d) has helped Cogent Bank prepare this proposal. MaxStability is consulting on MakerDAO governance communications and will help with legal structuring, closing, and onboarding. As part of MaxStability\u2019s Reporting Service, MaxStability will retrieve and deliver the off-chain data about assets relevant to the facility, and distribute this information to the MakerDAO community (unless said data must be permissioned, in which case MaxStability will distribute that data to relevant Core Units or SubDAO members who are under NDA). MaxStability will not in any way impede communication between any counterparty and any relevant Core Units or the community.  MIP95c4.3: Servicing Fee Fees for the loan servicing by Cogent, and for off-chain data reporting by MaxStability, and for governance consulting by MaxStability are collectively the \u201cS,G,&R Fees\u201d. The total S,G,&R Fees will be equal to one and one-quarter of one percent (1.25%) per annum on the first $10,000,000 participated to the MakerTrustDE of each individual Participated Loan (the \u201cBase Loan Balance\u201d). Over the Base Loan Balance, S,G,&R Fees on amounts participated to the MakerTrustDE out of each Participated Loan shall be three quarters of one percent (0.75%) per annum. For example, if Cogent participates $12M of a loan ($24M total loan size) to the MakerTrustDE, the S,G,&R Fees shall be ($10MM * 1.25%) + ($2M *.75%) = $125,000 + $15,000 = $140,000 per year, reducing proportionately to any amortization of the underlying loan (S,G,&R Fees decline on each participated loan as each loan amortizes). G&R will be 25 bps (0.25%) paid to MaxStability, and the remainder will be paid to Cogent as the Servicing Fee.  MIP95c5: MakerDAO Specific Issues  MIP95c5.1: Special Purpose Vehicle and Counterparties Cogent proposes participating loans to the existing RWA Master Participation Trust. Cogent proposes using all of the same legal documents and structures currently in use for the Huntingdon Valley Bank deal. The counterparty entities for the proposed Trust Structure are as follows:  Trust Sponsor  The Trust Sponsor is currently proposed to be the Cayman Islands Foundation RWA Foundation whose sole legal representative is its Supervisor. The jurisdiction and corporate structure of the Trust Sponsor may be amended on the advice of counsel. The Cayman Foundation, in its capacity as Trust Sponsor, will seek instruction from a committee elected and maintained by Maker Governance. It will pass this instruction to the Delaware Trustee when appropriate. It is anticipated that the Trust Sponsor will occasionally be required to weigh in on commercial and managerial issues with the facility. The Trust Agreement itself and any material term (the definition of which will be mutually defined by Cogent and MakerDAO) in the Participation Agreement may only be amended by using a Verification Agent, which checks for the affirmative vote of MakerDAO to corroborate the content of any amendment. The Trust Sponsor will issue irrevocable instructions to the Delaware Trustee and to the broker-dealer in order to ensure the security of cash flows.   A Delaware Statutory Trust (the existing RWA Master Participation Trust)  The Trust is a legal entity which will purchase and custody the assets, or liens over assets. It will be a Delaware Statutory Trust. This entity will enter into a Participation Agreement with Cogent Bank (the \u201cTransaction Documents\u201d). Said Transaction Documents will provide clear rules around the ability of Cogent Bank to participate loans to the Trust. All Transaction Documents pertaining to or entered into by the Trust will require an affirmative vote of MakerDAO, via a Verification Agent, to amend. Any actions deemed \u201cimmaterial\u201d in the agreements will be referred to the Trust Sponsor. The Delaware Trustee will have irrevocable instructions from the Trust Sponsor to only transfer USD from its escrow account to the Trust or to the bank account of the broker-dealer.   Broker-Dealers  In order to ensure secure transactions from Dai to USD and vice versa, the address of a regulated broker-dealer will be encoded into the MIP21 secure conduit. It is only this entity which will ever touch Dai. The broker-dealer has irrevocable instructions from the Trust Sponsor to only exchange Dai for USD and vice versa based on pre-agreed upon terms and may only send that Dai or USD to the Trust Sponsor\u2019s escrow account with the Trustee\u2019s bank or to the secure conduit. Multiple broker-dealers will be engaged so that there is redundancy in this part of the structure, which is needed as evidenced by the challenges with Genesis and the ongoing Genesis bankruptcy.     MIP95c5.2: In The Event of Ambiguity The terms and the final Agreements for this transaction will be approved by a vote of MKR token holders. Thereafter, decisions by all Parties will be in accordance with those Agreements and, if the Agreements are ambiguous, then clarifying amendments will be brought to an MKR vote or to a trusted third party appointed by an MKR vote.  MIP95c5.3: If Greenlit, Who Will Perform the Legal Review and the Credit/Risk Review for MakerDAO? This is a great question, considering the recent off-boarding of the RWF Core Unit. @Aes of the Strategic Finance Core Unit says that SF has the human resources on hand to perform both the legal review and the credit/risk review for MakerDAO.

If approved, Cogent Bank will participate $100M of loans to MakerDAO\u2019s existing RWA Master Participation Trust using the same Participation Agreement as MakerDAO\u2019s deal with Huntingdon Valley Bank, namely:  The Real World Asset(s): 50% participation(s) pari passu in loans originated by Cogent bank that have been assigned a \u201cPass\u201d rating in accordance with a federal regulatory grading framework. An Initial Debt Ceiling of: $100M Minimum Yield (a spread over benchmarks) to the RWA Master Participation Trust at the time of origination and participation (net of all S,G,&R Fees):  For floating-rate loans: 75 basis points over the 30-day average SOFR (implying a minimum floating yield of 4.85% as of January 5th, 2023) For fixed-rate loans: 30 basis points over the like-term treasury for fixed-rate loans (implying a minimum fixed yield of 4.15% as of January 5th, 2022) The vault stability fee will be set to 0%, but the net interest from the Minimum Yield will be sent to the Surplus Buffer. Eligible Loan Categories are listed here.     The servicing fee and the fee for governance & reporting (S,G,&R) are:  125bps on the first $10M of each participation. 75bps thereafter.   Uninvested dollars in the RWA Master Participation Trust will be invested in a short-term treasury money market such as SDIT Treasury II Fund Class F (SCPXX)  This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

Cogent processed 1,194 PPP loans in round 1 and 995 PPP loans in round 2. Their goal was to help their communities. Cogent operations are focused in the state of Florida through relationship management teams and banking centers located in seven Florida counties including Duval, Volusia, Orange, Hillsborough, Pinellas, Collier, and Lee counties as well as statewide lending teams focused on residential lending, small business lending, specialty lending (throughout the southeast), SBA (nation wide), and USDA lending (throughout the southeast).     flipflopflapdelegate:  What are the average rates for Construction Loans?   5.85%     flipflopflapdelegate:  Is the MIP applicant also looking to do CRE construction loans?   Cogent will not offer CRE construction loans for participation unless Maker requests to participate in CRE construction loans.     CodeKnight:  If approved, do you have an estimate of time frame for originating these loans once the dollars are transferred over?   A more thorough answer is forthcoming, but Cogent believes it can participate a sizable portfolio within 30 days of Maker funding the Trust. Once we have put together the details of that portfolio we will publish that information for discussion. No CRE construction loans will be included.     TRUEMAKER:  Can you please explain why you would explore DAI funding as opposed to the cheaper and likely easier to access FHLB loan ( e.g. lower collateral requirements and inverted yield curve). Or even just offering a high-yield savings account to capture additional funding? I would love to understand the reasoning.   This is an excellent question. Cogent has a long-term strategy for growth that includes an emphasis on risk minimization. Cogent\u2019s strategy is to have little or no reliance on non core funding sources such as FHLB and high yield savings accounts. It is considered high risk from a regulatory perspective to have reliance on non core funds. For more information, please see: Hahm, J. H., Shin, H. S., & Shin, K. (2011). Non-Core Bank Liabilities and Financial Vulnerability. Federal Reserve Board and JMCB Conference on \u201cRegulation of Systemic Risk\u201d. https://www.federalreserve.gov/events/conferences/2011/rsr/papers/HahmShinShin.pdf     ejbarraza:  What\u2019s the cost to borrow from the FHLB?   FHLB is a lender to banks (and a loan from FHLB is a liability on the bank\u2019s balance sheet). Deposits are also a liability of the bank. Instead of relying solely on those liabilities (leverage) to grow, Cogent has balanced risk with growth by recycling capital, selling many loans in the secondary market. MIP95 proposes that Cogent sell $100M of loan participations to MakerTrustDE, not borrow $100M from MakerDAO. Cogent\u2019s conservative growth model of recycling capital can be seen in Cogent\u2019s allocation of resources to SBA, USDA, residential and public finance divisions. MakerDAO is a natural fit for Cogent\u2019s model. Selling loan participations to Maker\u2019s RWA Master Participation Trust is like those other programs but revolutionary in that it places MakerDAO, a DeFi protocol, alongside those institutions in the market.     DaveringtonPLLC:  All in all, unfortunately due to workforce changes and this moment of transition into a pre-Endgame mode I don\u2019t think anyone can say with confidence that MakerDAO should replicate the HVB deal.   Thank you for this feedback @DaveringtonPLLC. Please have a look at the image below that I have taken from MakerBurn.  image963\u00d7747 158 KB  I see that real world asset revenue is the majority of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue at this time. It looks like MakerDAO would not be profitable without RWA revenue. MIP95 is an opportunity to quickly onboard a meaningful amount of high quality assets originated by a regulated American commercial bank. Moreover, unlike some other RWA accounts, the interest rate of these assets will follow benchmark rates as they rise (or fall) ensuring that MakerDAO gets prevailing rates with each participation. Yes, Endgame is the focus of our community right now, and the proposed transaction is very simple to pull off. It is a copy and paste of HVBank. As such, the legal structure has already been scrutinized. The HVBank docs are public, and you are an absolute expert in this domain of the law, so perhaps you\u2019d be willing to search for legal issues. To support Strategic Finance\u2019s credit/risk analysis, Cogent Bank is routinely audited by FDIC, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, outside auditor Hacker, Johnson & Smith, with internal audits by Saltmarsh, Cleaveland & Gund, and loan review by the StoneHill Group. Furthermore, before MakerTrustDE transfers a dollar of funds to Cogent, the Calculation Agent for the Trust, Ankura Trust Company, will examine the assets and issue a Participated Loan Satisfaction Notice stating, \u201cThe Calculation Agent confirms that the proposed Participated Loan satisfies the requirements of the Master Participation Agreement.\u201d In short, there are belts and suspenders galore. Cogent has a 0.389% ratio of non-performing assets to total loans. The proof is in the pudding. Though this community is putting its energy into Endgame, I have been told that Strategic Finance does have the human resources to perform credit/risk analysis and legal review for RWA deals. I believe this deal will be easy for them to analyze for all of the aforementioned reasons; an easy lift. Cogent is committed to expediently using the funds, and a proposed portfolio of actual loans is forthcoming for community review.     DaveringtonPLLC:  Personally, I love the HVB deal at a high level and would love to see the kind of partnership described here succeed and scale if it makes sense for MakerDAO to continue in this direction.   Thank you, @DaveringtonPLLC. We hope that you attend the Know Your MIP call with Cogent on February 8th at around 12:15 pm Eastern Standard so that we can listen to you.     maxglass:  The proposed transaction will be strategic to Cogent insofar as it doubles the Bank\u2019s capacity to originate loans to existing and new customers \u2014 this is MakerDAO\u2019s value to community banks.   This is a misstatement on my part. This facility will not double Cogent\u2019s capacity to originate loans overall, it will double Cogent\u2019s capacity to originate in each single instance of a loan because Cogent can participate half of each qualifying loan to RWA Master Participation Trust.     maxglass:  MIP95c2.8: Cogent\u2019s Risk Rating (Credit Rating) System Every loan in Cogent\u2019s portfolio is subjected to the same grading system, which has nine grades detailed here . Ratings 1 through 5 are \u201cPass\u201d ratings, and the rest, 6 through 9, are \u201cCited\u201d   For those who want a granular look at how Cogent does risk evaluation, below is the framework.

                    "content": "I\u2019m concerned about moving this proposal to a vote now because MakerDAO is currently under resourced and at an inflection point regarding Real World Assets (RWA). While the Strategic Finance Core Unit has an expanded RWA mandate under the new Endgame regime, they do not yet have an expanded team assembled and up to speed, including with regard to the HVB deal that this replicates. See Real-World Asset Report - 2022-12 for more details. Fortunately the SPF poll to fund credit and legal analysis was approved and is scheduled to be funded in the next Executive, but this does not allow time for the enhanced team to evaluate and provide recommendations to Delegates and MKR holders on this MIP95. The community would further benefit by evaluating this proposal in the wider context of how MakerDAO is planning to allocate attention and resources per the totality of shorter and longer term goals to be defined in a series of 12 scopes. I understand that the work to define \u201cScopes\u201d as referenced in the WIP Pregame Maker Constitution MIP draft is underway. However, current drafts have not yet been published to the community. For reference on RWA, this post may be instructive on some initial thinking as of December [WIP] Scope Framework Example Draft: Scope 3 - The Real World Asset Collateral Scope Framework. MIP13c3-SP13: Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults also recently passed. The discussion in this thread clearly points to a desire of the community to understand what kind of monitoring is possible with respect to existing Vaults to help inform where we should increase exposure or move in a different direction. All in all, unfortunately due to workforce changes and this moment of transition into a pre-Endgame mode I don\u2019t think anyone can say with confidence that MakerDAO should replicate the HVB deal. We definitely should wait for the review of the HVB vault that is ongoing with Strategic Finance to be concluded and then incorporate any changes that might be appropriate to make in this MIP proposal. At a superficial level replacing Genesis Trading for starters comes to mind. But most important would be the de novo review of what has been presented here from Cogent by internal workforce teams with a mandate to present a recommendation to MKR holders based on a clear due diligence process and defined standards of review. Personally, I love the HVB deal at a high level and would love to see the kind of partnership described here succeed and scale if it makes sense for MakerDAO to continue in this direction. We can only know the answer by going through more of the review and evaluation I\u2019ve noted above with respect to the current deal sets. Just wanted to share some fair warning from one person\u2019s perspective as to the timing. The potential exists to do things on much more solid footing by extending the period in RFC. Obviously an enormous amount of work has been done and it\u2019s a compliment to MakerDAO. ",

                    "content": "Thank you, I am very familiar with makerburn and know intimately the importance RWA has had for MakerDAO over the past year since I have been active in the community.     maxglass:  The HVBank docs are public, and you are an absolute expert in this domain of the law, so perhaps you\u2019d be willing to search for legal issues.   While I am a contributor here as Founder of @ACREinvest Recognized Delegate, I am not engaged as attorney for MakerDAO in any capacity. So my comments are just high level observations and the central point has nothing to do with the merits of your proposal. I state only the fact IMO that MakerDAO is not structurally and operationally in a good place TODAY to do the kind of review and implementation work required for this to align with a RWA strategy that we are only just starting to flesh-out in a thoughtful and effective way, with traction. Others probably know better about capacity constraints and priorities, so they can vote accordingly if it is as you suggest:     maxglass:  Though this community is putting its energy into Endgame, I have been told that Strategic Finance does have the human resources to perform credit/risk analysis and legal review for RWA deals. I believe this deal will be easy for them to analyze for all of the aforementioned reasons; an easy lift.   To the extent my personal views here align with how @ACREinvest will vote, it\u2019s pretty much consistent policy there since the beginning of the year to vote against new business at the moment as expressed in a recent Delgate Platform update:    ACREinvest Delegate Platform   However, our across-the-board view is that no new business should be approved until we understand short-term operating rules and priorities that will guide the community over the next 2 years. New pre-Endgame stance MIPs are being introduced this month for community discussion and ratification by MKR vote at the end of Q1 2023.   So, my concerns do not reflect a particular negative view on this proposal! ",

Cogent cannot agree in advance to buy back any loan.   To address concerns about liquidity for bank loan participations from HVBank (MIP6) and Cogent Bank (MIP95), I propose that RWA Master Participation Trust (\u201cMakerTrustDE\u201d) sign up for LoanStreet (\u201cLIQUIDATOR\u201d), a platform for liquidating bank loans and viewing comparable sales (data Maker can use to mark-to-market loans in RWA Master Participation Trust).

LoanStreet utilizes a single agreement across all trades that significantly reduces time spent negotiating contracts, allowing deals to close in days rather than weeks or months.

What party in this proposal receives the S,G,&R fees? A few points & comments here:  The servicing fee of 125 basis points on the first $10 million of each participation and 75 basis points thereafter is relatively high compared to other investment vehicles that MakerDAO has been proposed by other RWA suppliers. We believe the structure of the S,G,&R fees with different rates for different amounts of participation may be too complex and difficult for some MKR token owners and Recognized Delegates to understand, or dissect. With regards to the HVB Vault, one critique that has been on the minds of some of the Recognized Delegates is that the governance and reporting processes are not clearly defined or transparent, and this makes it difficult for Recognized Delegates to assess the value of the S,G,&R fees that are being paid.

OK. Feedback received. To address this, we can revise this fee structure in the Participation Agreement before onboarding. In practice, Cogent Bank does not expect to participate more than $10M of any loan, and that makes the fees easier to calculate and audit.     flipflopflapdelegate:  What party in this proposal receives the S,G,&R fees?       maxglass:  G&R will be 25 bps (0.25%) paid to MaxStability, and the remainder will be paid to Cogent as the Servicing Fee.   Out of 125 bps, Cogent charges 100 bps for servicing, and the rest (25 bps) is compensation to my firm for structuring the deal, consulting on governance, and working to address the important reporting concerns that you have brought up. My work to date has been on contingency (i.e. nothing, unless this goes through). Below I quote from MIP95 about my role.     maxglass:  MIP95c4.2: Governance Consulting & Reporting Fee MaxStability LLC (\u201cMaxStability\u201d) has helped Cogent Bank prepare this proposal. MaxStability is consulting on MakerDAO governance communications and will help with legal structuring, closing, and onboarding. As part of MaxStability\u2019s Reporting Service, MaxStability will retrieve and deliver the off-chain data about assets relevant to the facility, and distribute this information to the MakerDAO community (unless said data must be permissioned, in which case MaxStability will distribute that data to relevant Core Units or SubDAO members who are under NDA). MaxStability will not in any way impede communication between any counterparty and any relevant Core Units or the community.       flipflopflapdelegate:  With regards to the HVB Vault, one critique that has been on the minds of some of the Recognized Delegates is that the governance and reporting processes are not clearly defined or transparent, and this makes it difficult for Recognized Delegates to assess the value of the S,G,&R fees that are being paid.   Yes, I agree. The most pressing issue that I see is non-standardization of RWA data from Arranger to Arranger. Once data is standardized, apples-to-apples, it will be more clear where gaps exist and, to address gaps, Maker should mandate certain data attributes about each RWA. I am working with @itsjake007 now on an Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a standard schema and migration scripts to translate raw data into standardized. I have a background in parcel boundaries and tax assessor data standardization. We are hacking together this MVP in response to Flipside\u2019s Request For Proposal.     Request for Proposals for a on-chain RWA monitoring solution Governance       Since MIP13c3-SP13 passed with flying colors, we request potential partners to submit proposals or intent and initial scope for proposals as an answer to this forum post.  Here\u2019s the original discussion for reference: MIP13c3-SP13: Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults - Maker Improvement Proposals / Formal Submission - The Maker Forum (makerdao.com)  To recap: MakerDAO intends to fund a comprehensive on-chain RWA monitoring solution that co\u2026     Raw Data for HVBank & Cogent Bank On a monthly basis, Ankura Trust provides the raw data about activity/assets in the RWA Master Participation Trust. I do not know if a shorter reporting period would be useful. I think the first order of business should be to identify gaps in the reporting and mandate that those data attributes be published. The data standardization project that @itsjake007 will demonstrate intends to standardize RWA data across Maker so that we can identify gaps.     flipflopflapdelegate:  The servicing fee of 125 basis points on the first $10 million of each participation and 75 basis points thereafter is relatively high compared to other investment vehicles that MakerDAO has been proposed by other RWA suppliers.   I believe 100 bps is market rate. I know that Cogent gets 100 bps for servicing SBA and USDA loans. If these fees are the make-or-break between getting onboarded or not, we should reduce them. I want to do what is the best interest of MakerDAO. I did a cursory review of other RWA MIPs such as 65, 88, and 90 to understand those fees. What sets this MIP95 apart is that it guarantees a minimum yield to the trust above benchmark rates, net of fees, at the time of participation. As such, it looks like the Cogent Bank loan participations will pay the highest net yield among the proposals. Furthermore, I believe that participating in Cogent\u2019s loans will generate the best yield on a risk adjusted basis. ",
