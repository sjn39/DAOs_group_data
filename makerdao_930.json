                    "content": " Preface This body of work is a collaboration between the CES (@collateral-core-unit), Risk (@Risk-Core-Unit), Growth (@Growth-Core-Unit), PE (@Protocol-Engineering), and Oracle (@Oracles-Core-Unit) Core Units. I would like to thank the involved stakeholders for their valuable input. A special thanks to @rema and the Risk Core Unit for providing a comprehensive methodology to derive relevant financial metrics in accordance with their risk model, which was used extensively in this document.  Introduction This forum post aims to provide clarity for the Maker Community on how stakeholder Core Units involved in onchain/crypto collateral onboarding (as opposed to RWA collateral) assess collateral candidates, by establishing recommended guidelines for what the involved Core Units believe constitutes fitting on chain collateral candidates for MakerDAO. These are not formal requirements, but guidelines that should enable the Maker Community to more easily and effectively assess collateral onboarding applications, and provide transparency on why some collateral is prioritized higher than others. The hope is that these guidelines in addition to the new corresponding data points in the proposed MIP6 onboarding template should make it easier for Maker Governance to make an educated decision on whether or not to greenlight a prospect collateral, and to establish proper expectations between the applicant, the Maker Community and the stakeholder Core Units. It is impossible to construct a framework that can adequately score any collateral onboarding opportunity, as any asset comes with very specific characteristics and market conditions. For example, in some cases onboarding an asset into Maker can be the spark that increases adoption as we saw with WBTC when it was initially onboarded. In other cases there might be a strong strategic benefit for onboarding a collateral type. It\u2019s also important to stress that collateral types that meet these recommended guidelines are not guaranteed to be onboarded either, as other issues not identified here might arise. Therefore the goal is not to create a binary \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d framework, but to give the tools for MakerDAO to make an educated decision and prioritization of opportunities and resources before more in depth analyses are carried out. Therefore it is again important to stress that this is simply an informational resource and not formal requirements, that should help guide the community to form an initial high level opinion of a collateral application. It is also important to stress that the industry landscape is changing rapidly, and thus these guidelines will be subject to change as well. For example, if a potential collateral asset according to the guidelines is very difficult and therefore expensive to onboard while only being able to support marginal Dai generation, it should spur contemplation in the Maker Community whether the opportunity is worth pursuing. On the other hand if a collateral type can be easily supported with existing off the shelf components, and have a high Dai generation potential, it should be easy for Maker Governance to prioritize this collateral.  Recommended Metrics  Summary  30M Dai minimum target debt ceiling Clear business case Min. $250M market cap of circulating supply Min. $40M of onchain liquidity (132% of debt ceiling)  Traded on at least 5 exchanges with  Daily exchange volume of the collateral asset >$2M. Order book depth of over $200k in the +2% and -2% tiers   Technical metrics to gauge complexity and upfront implementation cost  The sections below will explain in more detail the reasoning behind the guideline metrics.  Debt ceiling  Target debt ceiling of minimum 30M Dai  The Core Units involved in onchain collateral onboarding have agreed that collateral candidates should ideally lead to the generation of at least 30M Dai. Other parameters in this document are directly derived from supporting at minimum this amount of Dai generated. We arrived at this number using a number of inputs: 1.  Cost of collateral onboarding and maintenance: Generating 30M Dai at a reasonable stability fee of 2 % should recoup the invested capital into onboarding and maintenance. Thus the 30M Dai generated is only about a net neutral or marginal positive investment for MakerDAO, so ideally MakerDAO should prioritize collateral types that have even higher Dai generation and revenue potential, but we believe starting at about net neutral is a good starting guideline. Collateral types with a lower amount of Dai generated are at risk of running at a net loss for MakerDAO. Onboarding and maintaining collateral involves various stakeholder teams and activities. The bullet points below aim to highlight the different high level activities. For collateral onboarding rough estimations were made that onboarding of an \u201ceasy-to-onboard\u201d asset, where existing smart contracts and price oracles can be utilized, would have an upfront cost of approx. $15,000, while a difficult asset that requires extensive bespoke smart contract or price oracle work including external audits could in extreme cases surpass $100,000. Ongoing operational and maintenance work have been estimated to cost between $350,000 and $500,000 per year depending on the difficulty of onboarding the collateral type, and the amount of required maintenance. There\u2019s a bit of uncertainty in this number due to the fluctuations in gas prices, which is one of the predominant cost factors in powering the price oracles. The total annual cost for onboarding a new asset is thus estimated to cost between $365,000 and $600,000 depending on the complexity. Upfront Work   Domain Team Assessments  Risk assessment Oracle assessment Technical assessment    Development work  Implementation of GemJoin adapter Implementation of ExchangeCallee contract Potential implementation other integration specific contracts Implementation of price oracle Potential technical audits Deploying and configuration of contracts Update auction keepers and auction UIs Update monitoring systems Update data APIs Implementation of executive spell    Governance Process  Management of signal requests, polls, and executive votes    Ongoing Operational/Maintenance Work  Governance process (signal requests, polls, votes etc.) Gas costs for oracles Monitoring services Technical maintenance and upgrades Ongoing market assessments Ongoing spell creation to change parameters  2.  Bandwidth: Core Units have limited bandwidth. It currently takes on average 97 days to move a collateral type through the pipeline, and historically we\u2019ve seen a collateral onboarding pace at 1-2 per month. Max capacity is currently estimated at onboarding two low difficulty collateral types per month, which would mean 24 collaterals on a yearly basis. 24 collateral types at 30M Dai would thus mean 720M Dai generated, which is only about 8 % of current total supply. To really make a large impact the Dai generation potential should be higher, thus the 30M Dai is just a guideline starting point, and opportunities with a higher potential should be prioritized higher. 3.  Opportunity Cost: Having limited bandwidth the Core Units believe that pursuing collateral types that cannot support generating at least 30M Dai has a high opportunity cost as working on onboarding such collateral would mean not working on other potentially higher impact collaterals. Therefore, even if the associated costs of onboarding and maintenance decrease, the Core Units believe that it shouldn\u2019t necessarily mean a lower target debt ceiling, because the opportunity cost remains high. However, if the bandwidth increases due to technology advances or higher workforce capacity, it will decrease the opportunity cost, in which case it might make sense to adjust the target debt ceiling.  885\u00d7296 26.9 KB   Clear Business Case While MakerDAO might be able to support a 30M debt ceiling from a technical, oracle and risk perspective, it doesn\u2019t mean that it will automatically be utilized. There needs to be an addressable market of users. Historically many large cap DeFi tokens have not gained the desired traction despite being deemed suited for onboarding. Therefore it is important to establish upfront what is the business case of the proposed vault type, and based on the overall lending market, what kind of usage can be expected. A good example of a clear business case are the GUNI and wstETH vaults, where GUNI enables a positive yield opportunity through leverage, and wstETH enables lending against ETH, but with added staking rewards. Prior integrations into DeFi or lending markets with demonstrated usage can be good indicators of a product market fit. A good collateral application should therefore present arguments for why the proposed vault will result in at minimum 30M Dai generated.  Market Cap  >$250M market cap of circulating supply  The market cap of circulating supply of the prospective asset is important to consider in order to ensure the Maker Protocol is not too exposed to a specific asset. For \u201cstandard\u201d crypto tokens, the proposed guideline is max ~30% of circulating supply, while for stablecoins in PSM, the guidelines is max ~50%. If we assume max 30% of circulating supply as a guideline for crypto token collateral, and average debt weighted CR in the vault type at 250%, the asset needs a minimum  circulating market cap of $250M for minimum DC of $30m (Min DC*CR/MaxRatioOfSupply = 30M*2.5/0.30 = 250M). For a 100M Dai debt ceiling, the circulating supply should be approx $830M.   Onchain Liquidity  >$40M of onchain liquidity (132% of debt ceiling)  The minimum liquidity is derived from the proposed guideline of a minimum debt ceiling of 30M Dai. By considering CR distribution of positions in ETH-A vault (best benchmark due to diversity and number of users) and expected drawdown or jump risk of 40%, it is expected that approximately 26.5% of total Dai debt will be liquidated. After this 40% drop, vaults CR will go below LR.  Based on previous min DCs, an estimation can be made for how much Dai debt would be liquidated in such a scenario.  If the liquidation penalty is 13%, the system can slip up to approx 27% price slippage before depleting the buffer created by the penalty and potentially creating bad debt. Max allowed price slippage after 40% drop is therefore 27%. By utilizing this number (27%) in the AMM x*y=k formula, it is derived that such slippage occurs when around 35-40% of assets are sold compared to the pool size of that asset. This means that assets should have approx. 5 times larger on-chain liquidity compared to liquidated debt (in case of an equally weighted two asset AMM). The guideline for minimum liquidity should therefore be approximately 132% larger than minimum DC required.  945\u00d7386 59.1 KB   Exchange Volumes and Order Book Depth   Traded on at least 5 exchanges with  Daily exchange volume of the collateral asset >$2M. Order book depth of over 200k in the +2% and -2% tiers    In order to construct a robust price Oracle, the price sources must be hard to manipulate. A high daily volume coupled with a high order book depth makes price manipulation more expensive. Having 5 separate price sources further increases the cost of manipulation, in addition to increasing the overall robustness of the price feed. It\u2019s important to understand that some exchanges have a lot of fake volume due to wash trading. Messari is a good resource for finding real exchange volumes.  Token Implementation The following guidelines should not be seen as deal breakers in itself, but any bullet point that is not met likely increases the technical difficulty and thus upfront cost of onboarding the asset. This means that unless the potential for Dai generation is higher than 30M, the onboarding may result in a net negative investment. If these guidelines are not met, it may require the implementation of a new GemJoin adapter, ExchangeCallee contract, or other bespoke smart contracts. Therefore these guidelines should be seen as a way to gauge the technical difficulty and thus upfront costs of onboarding the asset.  Implements ERC20 token standard  Can utilize existing ExchangeCallee contracts for flash liquidations  Currently supported exchanges: Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, Curve Must have sufficient liquidity on the above exchanges to support liquidations    Audit(s) from a reputable firm(s), e.g:  Trail of Bits ChainSecurity ABDK   No admin functions/upgradability No rebasing/changing supply of individual token balances No blacklists/whitelists  Transfer semantics should be simple  E.g. no fees on transfers     Exceptions As mentioned in the introduction, this post only presents high level guidelines, and thus in practice exceptions must and should be made. In some cases onboarding a specific collateral might be beneficial from a strategic point of view, e.g. as alignment with a specific business partner or as part of a larger collaboration. In some cases, an onboarding can also be what drives the utility of the underlying asset, meaning that it can help bootstrap its market. An example of this is WBTC that saw very little usage on Ethereum prior to being onboarded to the Maker Protocol, which proved to be the catalyst for its growth and use across DeFi. Therefore it is important to consider whether the asset in question might offer other strategic benefits besides Dai generation and increased revenues. ",

There\u2019s the recent SR asking MKR token owners if they want to off-board just about every on-chain collateral, and now that possibly most of Retail has exited because of the recent events, lost-in-confidence, market conditions, macro-environment, etc., will CES reassess these guidelines? How are thinking about things moving forward, I imagine you\u2019ll want to hear what strategic growth path the DAO will take, and if possible how to cut on expenditures.

                    "content": "We actually discussed this recently in the onchain collateral call, and despite the recent market movements the consensus was that the biggest cost of onboarding collateral is still opportunity cost, in terms of the bandwidth of the Core Units, and the amount of collateral types that can realistically be onboarded within a specific timespan. Therefore I personally believe the 30M Dai generated (which we considered a low bar, to avoid filtering too many opportunities, when we defined the metrics) is still a good benchmark to follow. Personally I think Dai should be backed by high quality collateral that users can trust and can scale, and therefore resources and focus should be spent on that, rather than small cap tokens that cannot. With that said, we are obviously continuously evaluating these guidelines as the market moves, however I want to again stress that these are just suggested metrics, and that it is up to Maker holders to make a decision whether or not to green light a prospective collateral. As to the SR for offboarding 5 ilks (UNI and 4 UNIV2 LP Pairs), we\u2019ve been monitoring those for quite a while, and they have minimal usage (much lower than the recommended 30M Dai generated, even combined) and are running at a net loss for Maker. Furthermore because they are mainly UniV2 LP pairs, we do not expect a future increase of usage, thus the onchain collateral group decided to create a signal for offboarding - it is then again ultimately up to Maker Governance to decide how to proceed.

This is something I\u2019ve been thinking about since we started the dissolution at the Maker Foundation. I knew the Core Unit structure would naturally evolve, like any good experiment. The biggest concern I have is the transition from old to new. I\u2019ve experienced slash and burn to orderly transitions when undergoing transformations. It\u2019s all about the path we take as a DAO when approaching this effort. We do it the hard way or the easy way but any way you cut it, it\u2019s going to happen. I think that was a line from some movie. Overall, I\u2019m not concerned with Maker\u2019s evolution since we have a lot of smart people thinking about all of the DAO\u2019s dynamics. I\u2019m a fan of clear direction. If the current conversations materialize into that, CES will organize in a way that supports the clarity. I don\u2019t have any specifics so it\u2019s hard to comment at this moment. If multiple proposals emerge on Maker\u2019s future, I hope we\u2019ll all consider what is best for the protocol and community. The only thing better than MKR go up is MKR go up and our community goes with it. Disruptive initiatives (revolution vs evolution) rarely work and current history is a great example. ",
