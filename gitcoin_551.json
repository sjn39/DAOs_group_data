While recommending that Tech Operations should be an independent workstream, it is already being bootstrapped at a functional level. For more on the functions & responsibilities of the workstream see Jessica Zartler\u2019s post mapping the current setup of the FDD-WG.  Additional Considerations for Funding FDD-WG Legitimacy in quadratic funding is dependent on sybil-resistance Quadratic Funding is based on Sybil-Resistance. Without unique users behind each account, the mechanism can and will be gamed. The current work started with the Gitcoin Holdings core team as they brought in Blockscience as contractors to help solve this problem. This budget will allow the continuation of this work and build on the upfront costs already paid for by Gitcoin Holdings. Continuity in processes which have proven to be successful This group has been working towards understanding the effect of sybil accounts on the grants mechanism since GR7. The fraud tax was introduced in GR9. Members of this workstream are responsible for taking the fraud tax from 6.6% to 2.1% as can be seen in the GR10 Governance Brief.  852\u00d7593 78 KB  Subjective decisions should not be connected to Gitcoin Holdings Inc Many of the decisions made require subjective decision making, strong governance processes, and some even include PII data. For these reasons it would be easier to allow Gitcoin Holdings to directly handle them, but with the goal being decentralization we propose it would be better for the DAO to fund the contractors and coordinators for this workstream. This moves the power away from Gitcoin Holdings and into the community. In addition, rewarding contributors creates decentralizing pressure on these processes. Hiring a full-time coordinator with a proven track record Disruption Joe has been with the Gitcoin Holdings team since the end of GR7. His primary responsibilities started as a growth marketer where he helped the team develop a growth plan in Q4 2020 and execute to achieve their growth OKRs for the first half of 2021. He has also led the Gitcoin team\u2019s operations during grants rounds GR8, GR9, & GR10 including facilitating relationships with Blockscience & the TEC Open Science programs. Most importantly, he has been a core contributor to this workstream from the beginning. Setting a precedent for Gitcoin Holdings team members to \u201cmove to the DAO\u201d is an important step for progressive decentralization. Review Gitcoin blog posts by Joe: GR10 Governance Brief | Community Outreach with MGD DAO Setting precedent and beginning experimentation for allocation of DAO rewards DAOs can fall into the trap of not finding the proper method to be able to sustainably activate the community. Allowing workstreams with trusted coordinators the freedom to find their best solutions will provide a catalyst for the cultural evolution of GitcoinDAO.  In Conclusion The DAO as a whole is still figuring out the mechanism design which will be used to facilitate contributor rewards going forward. These solutions should promote the best bottoms-up ideas and codify the rulesets after reaching quorum. They will allow the competitive advantage of rewarding contributions while maintaining legitimacy. This workstream needs the funding to protect both the grants mechanism and the GitcoinDAO while the DAO solves these complex issues. ",

Quadratic funding is a really exciting notion and a cool experiment to see unfold over the various rounds as a way to achieve this goal. Unfortunately it also has many limitations and many of them are reolving around fraud, sybil and collusion. People cheating. I think this is a really really hard problem for gitcoin, and other protocols/systems where fraud/collusion can happen. So it is with great pleasure to try to do a small part in helping achieve this goal by by being a multisig signer. I will try to do my best to serve the workstream, and the gitcoin community and promise to seek a replacement if at some point the workload  becomes too much for me. Finally as with this proposal I would be getting a small amount of GTC as signer, I will also abstain from voting on it. ",
