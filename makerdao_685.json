This pseudo-buy back mechanism was designed to stimulate demand for MKR as the supply of DAI grows.  I am confused. Is the stability fee denominated in DAI or MKR? If the blog\u2019s version is true, then how does the \u201cbuy-back\u201d work? ",

                    "content": "Stability fees accrue in Dai every second, but are only updated on chain once someone calls jug.drip. They way it works is that the Dai debt of your vault increases over time. Thus if you want to retrieve the entire collateral amount, you must pay down the principal amount + stability fees. You can read more about stability fee accumulation here and here. The protocol accrued stability fees are directed to the surplus buffer, aka the vow. Once the surplus buffer reaches a limit set by Maker Governance in Dai, surplus auctions (flap) can be triggered, which aims to sell off excess Dai in the buffer for MKR. The MKR received by the protocol in these auctions are then burned. You can read more about the vow and the flapper here, here, and here. ",
