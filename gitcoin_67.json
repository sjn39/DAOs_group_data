Hey Huxwell, I want to call out that this really rubbed me the wrong way - \u201cno mutual grant agreement would be created.\u201d Gitcoin has bootstrapped your entire development effort, extended its brand, conference and community for you test your ideas thus far (AFAIK). Putting the point in here that no funding for S14 would have you walk away from that support with no upside to Gitcoin is wild to me. I wonder if I am miss-understanding what you mean here? Asking for 19k GTC is relatively small, but dCompass has continually missed outcomes is has stated it would achieve and fails to attract traction (outside of those in Gitcoin trying to support your efforts with paths like Grants and FDD). I believe you are learning an immense amount about why it is so hard to start a project as a technical founder and still make progress on growing/testing your hypothesis, but largely defecting from the Gitcoin DAO does not seem to have paid off.

This is a great question and something I want to really make sure I spell out. A decision to not fund dCompass (IMO) is not because it is a failure. It would be because Gitcoin needs to focus on the most important thing and cover off spend in areas that are adjacent to its core protocol ambitions. The work you are doing, the product you are building and community you are growing is not something I would ever call a failure. It may be something that now longer fits where Gitcoin can spend resources though. Hopefully you don\u2019t assume that a decision to not fund in S14 means failure. It could mean instead that its time for Gitcoin to refocus where it invests, and for you to continue to grow and launch to see if you can get traction.

Yes the calculation is pretty much right as an average for the PT & FT contributors. I\u2019d even say that we\u2019re underpaying ourselves if we were to compare with the dev salaries of other workstreams/in the space. But we were fine with that as it reduces our burn rate and helps the project over the long run. Gitcoin DAO is doing a good job at incubating us! However, we have bigger needs than what\u2019s on our budget request and I don\u2019t think that it would be healthy to stay as a workstream that keeps requesting more GTC over time while the focus of the DAO seems to be around funding other initiatives.

At a macro level, I very much also echo the questions raised about whether dCompass should continue to exist as a workstream in the context of the DAO. While the Trello links are helpful to dive into some of the specific objectives, I believe this budget request lacks context as to the \u2018why\u2019 of dCompass & the broader vision it is setting out to accomplish, and how that fits into the rest of the work the DAO does. Given our focus on Grants 2.0 & becoming a Protocol DAO and my lack of clarity as to how dCompass fits into that, I plan to vote \u2018no\u2019 on this budget request. That said, I am eager to explore @DisruptionJoe\u2019s suggestion of evaluating dCompass in a Mutual Grants context. Finally, if this budget request is indeed pushed forward as a workstream funding request as proposed - to @fishbiscuit\u2019s point, in keeping consistent with the approach of all the other workstreams, I believe the requested amount should be 3.5K GTC, not 19K GTC.

Did I read this right?  dCompass will be renegging on the previously offered governance rights if this proposal is not funded? (see below)    [Discussion] dCompass - release plan and beyond   Yes Gitcoin DAO should have a say in the governance of the dCompass DAO. Gitcoin is the biggest funder so far and it makes sense if it\u2019s one of the main governing entity of the dCompass DAO. I\u2019m open to negotiate regarding the amount but we can offer 2 seats in our council, which is currently a 3/5 multisig that we can update to be 5/8 so by owning 2 seats, Gitcoin DAO would have 25% of the governance rights. If Gitcoin DAO continues to fund us (through GTC or any other token), we\u2019re open to make a mutual grant agreement to make a swap between GTC and the DCOMP token for a maximum of 5% of our total supply.       Huxwell:  Sorry it was a clumsy statement coming from this post, in the context of a failure, why would Gitcoin even bother for a mutual grant ?
