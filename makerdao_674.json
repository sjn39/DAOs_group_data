But the truth is that Tron\u2019s reputation in the ETH ecosystem especially in the MakerDAO ecosystem is quite low.

As you have mentioned, yourself TUSD is a significant stablecoin, and its consistent growth and growing list of partners over the last year have to stand for proof of its quality. I believe we can all agree that if there was any doubt in TrueUSD since its acquisition by Techteryx, the growth would have been cut short. In regards to the alledged \u201cgovernance attacks\u201d, I\u2019d like to state that this article was contested by the Compound community as soon as it was published. You will be able to check it online, Justin Sun had the greenlight from the compound team to borrow COMP in order to vote. Additionally, TUSD was  reviewed and confirmed as a low-risk associated collateral. Nevertheless, as previously stated if you\u2019d like to contribute to this discussion by sharing your thoughts on TrueUSD as a stablecoin, by all means please do, feel free to contribute more to this thread!

They\u2019ve been very vocal on all of the threads, so I want to give them a fair shake.     Doo_StableLab:  There\u2019s no doubt that TUSD is a significant stablecoin, but then the reputation is also important and I afraid that this will take a long time to build up such reputation at least within the Maker community.   I hear you on this, I was skeptical as well. What else do you think can be done by the TUSD to increase their reputation in the MakerDAO community? The reason why I\u2019m asking is because I believe reintroducing TUSD to the Maker ecosystem would hit all three points of focus on your delegate platform and help growth. I think a continued emphasis on security and backing could alleviate concerns for our community. For example, requiring the TUSD team to work with MakerDAO to provide those real-time attestations directly on-chain to monitor the backing actively and take immediate action if needed. @AnnabelTUSD, would it be possible to make such an on-chain arrangement?

At the moment, we provide real-time audits 24/7 that users can consult on Armanino\u2019s website or from ours directly. Additionally, we have provided this link in our TUSD-PSM proposal for users and delegates to review. If you have any additional ideas, please feel free to let me know as we would be happy to work with MakerDAO to make things easier for users to check TUSD and feel reassured! ",

This would provide a failsafe when minting DAI from the TUSD vault/PSM and reduce counterparty risk to TrueUSD. It\u2019s great that you provide those attestations, but it would be better to automatically leverage them without the need to check manually. For example, using the Chainlink TUSD Proof-of-Reserve Feed that your team previously shared, the protocol can verify that TUSD is sufficiently backed before accepting TUSD into the vault/PSM and minting DAI. In the worst-case scenario, MakerDAO is protected from TUSD being illiquid and accepting more TUSD. On the flip side, this mechanism could also be used to flag any undercollateralized TUSD vaults that need to be liquidated. Theoretically, this should all be possible, but the TrueUSD team would need to work with MakerDAO to confirm if this is feasible. You\u2019d then need to develop it for the vaults or PSM and outline the technical specifications, costs, risks, etc. Although TUSD is currently being offboarded, a continued commitment to transparency and security through blockchain-based solutions would make TrueUSD more trustworthy to me and hopefully others for any future vault or PSM proposal.

All centralized stablecoins including TUSD contain a freeze function that allows the issuer to freeze users assets. Other centralized stablecoins are controlled by entities that are either trustworthy or have a track record of not abusing this power. Why would we trust your company to act responsibly with this function? Because if Justin Sun is in any way involved with the entity, or even has a sizeable ownership percentage in the entity, that controls this function\u2026 Well then this conversation is probably a non-starter.

                    "content": "Hello Ed, TrueUSD used to have a freeze function and that function was removed on request by MakerDAO when we first launched TrueUSD with them. TrueUSD is a centralized stablecoin that is set up differently than other stablecoins where we use third-party custodians (trust companies and banks) that hold the TrueUSD holder funds in escrow accounts that can not be accessed by the TrueUSD team. All out balances are attested by an independent auditor on an ongoing basis, no other stablecoin provides that functionality. You can follow this link: TrustExplorer by Armanino: Real-Time Attest for TrueCurrency for further information and the current audit reports. We basically have linked Armanino directly to the bank accounts and they are pulling the amounts and verifying them against the TrueUSD amounts in circulation on all chains in real-time. TrueUSD has also established a bank-level compliance program that conservatively vets all users before they can interact with the stablecoin directly, the program is audited on an ongoing basis. TrueUSD has been on the forefront of stablecoin development and has strived to be the most transparent and trusted stablecoin out there. We go further than any other stablecoin issuer putting the power to mint and redeem in the hand of the user, establishing failsafes, are regulated via FinCen as a Money Service Business, and are using escrow accounts that will still operate was the centralised entity of TrueCoin LLC no longer be operating. In regards to your concerns about Justin Sun there is no relation between TrueUSD and him other than he is an advisor to allow TrueUSD to a.) increase adoption within the TRON network and b.) provide his expertise in marketing efforts within Asia. He is not part of the running of TrueUSD nor does he own any part of TrueUSD or the entities that own and operate TrueUSD. I hope this helps address your concerns, let me know if I can answer any other question! ",
