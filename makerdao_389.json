Project Real-World Sandbox aims to define the lending stack in actionable terms for MakerDAO, identifying entry points, challenges, and advantages the protocol will have in the space. To enable this project, the team first needed to define TradFi\u2019s \u2018lending stack\u2019. This complex system of diverse parties enables a map of entry points and shows a preliminary approach of iteration to safely and confidently enter the market. Lending is built on the primitive concept of credit as a promise, and there are several categories of credit with varying characteristics. Governments, institutions, businesses, and individual borrowers all have different roles and incentives for participating in each category. Utilizing the team\u2019s deep experience with TradFi, this analysis facilitates the creation of Maker\u2019s definitions of real-world finance and serves as the foundation for creating a manifesto for real-world finance future activities within MakerDAO.  Find the full report here.   Who is the Project Team? Led by Luca Prosperi @luca_pro, this project enabled industry experts in TradFi, with a keen interest in DeFi, to participate in MakerDAO. The project invited expertise to contribute to the protocol through exploring a highly regulated and complex landscape. Luca has over 15-years of experience in the investing and centralized banking world. He is the author of Dirt Roads - dirtroads.substack.com, a weekly newsletter on the evolution of banking, focusing on the back end of finance and money. More can be found on his LinkedIn profile here: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lucaprosperi   Defining the Lending Stack The lending stack is more commonly known as the monetary stack. It is the mechanism that economies utilize to enable an effective allocation of money across different use cases. Sovereign issuers of money participate in this ecosystem through banks and other authorized intermediaries to create and distribute money in the form of cash or credit. The TradFi approach to the lending stack carries similarities and differences to DeFi\u2019s observed qualities. Trust is paramount - whether it is with Maker or global governmental institutions. Stability as a core value is also very important when enabling credit in the real world. TradFi\u2019s approach to enabling these values carries with it complex regulations but has a track record to highlight its performance. Because of this, Maker\u2019s role in the lending stack should be somehow similar to central banks, with a mandate of sustainable growth rather than profit maximization. Maker\u2019s ability to mint currency at a very low cost will define the protocol as a powerful player in this space, as long as trust and stability remain in focus. The report goes into further detail on collateral packaging and defining trust, with real-world credit examples.  Credit Types and Collateral Eligibility Criteria The report divides credit types into 5 board categories, providing definitions and attributes for categorization. Those categories are:  Short-term corporate loans Long-term corporate loans Consumer loans Real estate loans Bank loans  A table summarizing the credit categories, along with ranking each category to Maker\u2019s vision and mission was produced in the report from this analysis.  695\u00d7438 59.8 KB  The report identified non-exclusively short-term corporate loans, consumer loans, and bank loans as the credit types that are most compatible and immediately accessible to Maker\u2019s vision. Work with counterparties will be required in order to successfully fit in the lending stack associated with these credit categories. The process of choosing these counterparties follows a similar analysis as to which credit category to support. Building on elementary credit categories and ideal counterparty definitions, the report team then introduces funding structures. Funding structures are used by intermediaries to package credit assets in order to distribute them to investors. Structuring TradFi for DeFi introduces more non-trivial complexities Maker must address for building this bridge. The report categorized the most popular funding structures according to the complexity and augments these requirements with a list of Maker\u2019s additional requirements. From the above analysis, a simplified list of so-called eligibility criteria for real-world collateral types emerges.  725\u00d7664 111 KB   Process Set-Up Setting up a resilient and scalable process to onboard and manage real-world credit is of fundamental importance, and the steps to set up such a process are described in great detail in the report. The outline provides guidance for core unit creation and participation, governance, community\u2019s roles, and the flow of tasks/data for a compliant, powerful DeFi-TradFi bridge.  The report starts by envisioning a multi-tiered organization, with community governance at the head of the table. Defining mission and core principles should provide the foundation for the ecosystem to support future initiatives. The existing responsibilities of the Real-World Finance Core Unit would be distributed to redesigned Real-World Finance (RWF) Portfolio Core Units. These will be specialized and focused on their mission of onboarding and monitoring collateral. Legal support is highlighted as a requirement, and a specialized RWF Legal Support Core Unit is also proposed.  1895\u00d71158 255 KB  Functionally above the RWF Portfolio Core Units, a RWF Compliance Core Unit would monitor the compliance of those CUs to the principles outlined in a manifesto. These are principles that are agnostic to the types of credit, counterparty, or structure. Maker\u2019s community would in turn hold the ecosystem and process in check, providing challenges and assessments throughout. In practice, this engine would be enacted through a three-step process:  A counterparty would submit a MIP6 formatted proposal to get approval for a certain type of collateral The RWF Portfolio Core Unit (who specializes in that collateral risk type) would deal directly with the applying counterparty; the Core Unit would negotiate the most appropriate terms and produce all the documentation and facilitation needed for the review, and ultimately provide a qualified opinion on the application Assuming the proposal is brought forward, the RWF Compliance Core Unit will then serve as a fact-checker of the application, and further, verify that the whole process meets Maker\u2019s vision. This then progresses to governance for the ultimate vote   MakerDAO\u2019s Real-World Financing Manifesto The report and its disciplined research concludes with the call to author a RWF Manifesto that governance should vote on to adopt supporting this research. The outline of the manifesto provided in this report clearly defines the basis for Maker\u2019s real-world activities. The report also encourages the manifesto to serve as an early mandate of a proposed new RWF Compliance Core Unit. The proposed outline for such manifesto is:  Overarching Mission and Vision Key Eligibility Criteria Process Core Governance Principles   Next Steps The 7,000+ word report is available for viewing here. The community is needed to refine this vision. Join us in discussing and drafting the MakerDAO\u2019s Real-World Financing Manifesto on this forum thread. For a deeper dive into the report, Luca\u2019s mid-report update can be found here, and a recorded Q&A discussion of the report conducted by its author can be found here. ",

                    "content": "Very interesting report! I am very happy to see this issue starting to get a real deep examination. Now, as the report stands right now, it has a few leaps of logic as far as I can tell. I think we owe it to ourselves to examine them with some care and perhaps do some further analysis before making decisions on what to recommend to the community. After all, this is expected to be the bedrock of logic that Maker may move forward to build a multi-billion/trillion dollar real world asset side on. I will start with this logical leap that I would suggest requires further examination - and I hope others can help us dig much deeper into it. It goes something like this as far as I can tell: \u2026We are more like a central bank than a retail/investment bank and therefore we should go for credit assets similar to what central banks would go for\u2026  First Principle based thinking? I think we can all agree that the Maker protocol is not exactly a central bank (not sovereign backed, does not provide legal tender or promise to pay bearer anything, can\u2019t pay tax with it, can\u2019t settle debt with it, no lender of last resort, - nor a mandate to promote price/inflation stability etc etc), nor is it exactly a retail/commercial bank (no depositors, no lender of last resort behind it, no depositors insurance, no regulated solvency capital, etc) or investment bank (Maker is not an intermediary) or even a shadow bank (Maker does not operate in the shadow - it\u2019s excruciatingly and painfully transparent). The protocol shares certain features and potential dynamics with all these well-known structures (worries about \u201cbank-run\u201d, worries about keeping a peg, off any regulated balance sheet etc), but it certainly also has its own uniquenesses (pure collateral backing - no public safety net, no regulatory framework, real-time dynamics, highly-volatile collateral base, unique use-cases for it\u2019s currency, crypto mono-exposure, etc). This leads me to believe we should approach the problem from a first principle basis rather than analogy basis - or we may have important aspects \u2018get lost in translation\u2019 going from analogy to reality. I can try to get us started on a first principles review, but I hope the community will help move these thoughts forward.  Maker: Basic Description to start from My quick description of Maker (\u2026and we do unfortunately need to go through this step, because if we don\u2019t agree on where we are, then certainly we won\u2019t agree on where we are going\u2026), from which to make a first principle reasoning from, would go something like this: The essential function of the Maker Procol is to:   Allow parties to put collateral under the control of the Maker Protocol under a certain rule-set for valuation, coverage ratio, \u2018auto under-collateralization auction mechanism\u2019 and stability fee, and in return borrow DAI tokens from the Protocol   Maker will, on a best effort basis, keep the DAI token soft pegged to USD in value (1 USD ~ 1 DAI).   To keep this peg promise, a few characteristics are required to be kept in balance:   Value: Market Value of Collateral must be more than the issued DAI value in USD by a certain margin   Liquidity: DAI demand must not materially diverge from supply - and there must be a certain level of market activity daily in the market.   To keep this balance, Maker rely on a number of mechanisms:   Risk analysis per collateral type and vault that sets the level of over-collateralization, Stability Fee etc. - both at onboarding as well as with interval to make changes according to change in risks   An auction mechanism designed to \u2018clean-up\u2019 situations of collateralization dropping off target (now rather robust after the Black Thursday related changes)   Dai Savings Rate mechanism (\u201cdemand booster\u201d)   Peg Stability Module/USDC/USDP/GUSD mechanisms (\u201cliquidity creator & PEG stabilizers\u201d)   Above mechanisms solve the\u201dbusiness-as-usual\u201d for Maker, but for extreme events in terms of Value loss there are further mechanisms:   First layer of defense is the Surplus Buffer (USD 90M - as approved level)   The ultimate protection-layer is MKR token minting and auction (market cap USD ~3B)   There appear to be some discussions on what is the right level of Buffer to maintain. If I understand the Risk Core Unit correctly, they have estimated a Capital-at-Risk which is equal to conservative estimate for how much Maker would lose should all vaults and collateral types hit certain extreme value decreases - taking into account both value and liquidity pressures (as I understand it). https://maker.blockanalitica.com/ Capital-at-Risk stands today at ~140M or ~3% of outstanding balances - and is matched with an allocated Surplus Buffer of USD 90M. I suspect the argument by the Risk Core Unit would be that a closer match between Buffer level and their Capital-at-Risk number would be preferred. In short, Maker appears fairly thin risk capitalized on a \u201cBuffer-only\u201d perspective, but clearly heavily risk capitalized if MKR minting possibility is taken into account (Market cap of USD ~3B vs DAI ~9B balance outstanding). We also know the protocol is today strongly positive net income generating (fees minus cost) - i.e. should crypto collateral balances swell 10x, the Buffer account could follow, with a time lag, to maintain a stable risk capital ratio. Obviously changes to DSR and/or global SF level could change this income generation - and of course is contingent on allocation by MKR holders. So, overall, the risks that keep the Risk Core Unit up at night is not so much growth or day-to-day smaller movements in collateral values or liquidity demands, but the extreme events a la Black Thursday - the black swans, the very low probability, but high impact events - and if there is enough capital and process in place to recover from such an unexpected event. Another important characteristic on the balance sheet of Maker, is the split between loans and trading assets. Loans are the yield generating collateral vaults, and trading assets are 0% USDC/USDP/GUSD taken on for the purpose of liquidity and PEG stability. I am not sure what the levels are today of each category exactly, but the liquidity/trading assets are clearly of meaningful size - ~30%+ of the balance sheet today perhaps (?). I.e. in broad terms we have two classes of assets with somewhat different purposes (yield vs liquidity/peg stability). Clearly both classes are needed for Maker to grow sustainably. Important to note that there is no particular risk capital required/calculated under the USDC/USDP/GUSD component - as a consequence of this component is \u2018risk free\u2019 - excluding of course the underlying regulatory risk of a fixed peg stablecoin. Now, an interesting conversation could be had on what drives the trust in the currency - and as such it\u2019s peg. Clearly the trade connection with USDC/USDP/GUSD have helped stabilize the peg dramatically, but what role does the safety and risk management and mechanisms provided around the yielding Vaults play? I.e. collateralization ratios and stability fee\u2019s etc\u2026 Clearly these numbers change demand for these vaults, and clearly Maker must have a principled view that the numbers are required for Maker to survive financially extreme events. But how much does it matter to the users of the currency? Because RWA at scale will make changes to these numbers overall for Maker - in particular overall collateralization ratio. The working assumption probably might be that these numbers play only a smaller role - the nature of the assets backing the currency and the peg connectivity to other stable coins drives the peg. Lastly, I wanted to say something about what the clear path is for a 100x increase in DAI demand - as probably that would tell us something about the assets best fitted to ensure this happening. I don\u2019t have the answer here yet. But I am sure other community members can add on this point.  Designing an RWA Strategy Now, given the validity of, and agreement on, the above description, the design of an RWA strategy and potential implementation, I believe, becomes easier. The facts somewhat help dictate the design.  Twin engine RWA? The first part I think the facts dictate is to split the strategy into two - matching the current dual purposes and assets on the current balance sheet: RWA as a stabilizer for the liquidity component and RWA as a balance sheet expansionary force for the yield generating part. On the surface of it, one would run these two strategies concurrently and coordinated, but separately. See it as a required macro-level necessary asset allocation. What should be the exact balance between the two strategies? I don\u2019t have the answer, but for sure it should be measured and a strategy for it set and executed on. The result is what one would call a barbell shaped investment strategy: an exceptionally liquid and low risk end, allowing for a higher yield, higher risk end (I will later suggest a manner to think about and protect against these risks). This picture might make it more clear:  1382\u00d7577 94.7 KB  Let me provide some initial thoughts on each RWA part (and I hope the community can build on it!):  A/ The PSM/USDC/USDP/GUSD exposure - the Liquidity Strategy Component. I understand the mechanism to work quite well in stabilizing the peg, but leaves Maker with a large USDC/USDP/GUSD exposure. We can of course transform these exposures into RWA. The question is into what - and how much of these amounts. According to the Risk Core Unit, there is a request that these exposures are preferably not to be moved up any duration or risk curve - i.e. they are to be immediately liquid and largely risk free - such that they are at the ready to defend any peg challenges. Now you might say if this is actually the case, then why move these exposures at all? I believe the answer lies primarily in counterparty/regulatory risk evaluation of fixed peg stable coins. This, to me, sounds like there is a need for setting up something like a US aggregate liquid bond fund type purchasing/selling program - plenty of this available at institutional investor level from many providers - Blackrock, State Street, Pimco, JP Morgan etc. On the surface, It should accomplish the above and deliver a minor yield. If it is professionally managed and of size, it should also appropriately navigate for the current inflationary pressures in the bond market - and its current behaviour anomalies. As Maker grows and I am sure we will see more peg stability programs/ measures, this \u2018liquid, risk-free bond\u2019 program can be spun further up or down as necessary. Maybe even part of the liquidity allocation can be allocated to the yielding strategy programs. I would imagine even with this sort of program, a balance would need to remain in USDC/USDP/GUSD for speed. This purchase program should be a fairly rapid setup - a few months max. Depending upon the bond funds and structures chosen - and the outlook of the market (the wall of money in the market, the dithering between growth, inflation and crisis/bubble makes \u2018real economics\u2019 of market assets - even bonds - a bit hidden in my personal view in current asset prices) one could potentially add a small charge towards the Surplus Buffer in response to implicit systemic risks in this asset class and financial system one necessarily is integrating with under such a program. I do, of course, see some practical difficulties in designing and putting this out in the current market environment. We\u2019d have to think a bit to come up with a liquid, zero risk strategy with some inflation protection in it. And would have to make it fast responding for sure given the market movements right now. On the surface of it, I would probably engage someone very institutional with deep knowledge, like PIMCO or similar, to develop a strategy and implementation. These charts sort of symbolises some of the challenges in this sort of market today  No inflation response?!? Very odd indeed.  Chase for yield just continues and presses higher risk instruments prices down. Very disconcerting. Low yield for high risk. Not good.  B/ The Yielding Vaults - Return Strategy Component Now, as far as I can see, there is little logic that would prevent Maker from riding the entire possible risk/return credit curve, given it is well-managed and has appropriate risk capital allocations and controls. So far Maker has been able to back the DAI with exceptionally volatile assets - and develop an important source of income to the benefit of the protocol - yet retain a stable peg by combining these mechanisms with the liquidity measures mentioned earlier. It\u2019s the \u2018givens\u2019 above, in my view, that truly forces Maker down the risk/return curve: Not a lot of Surplus Capital Buffer to allocate towards RWA to take on adventurous credit assets available, and lack of deep internal experiences and resources for evaluating more adventurous RWA credit assets. Probably, there is also a general community view that Maker should move slowly up this RWA risk/return curve and solidify operations and strategy as we go along - very prudent approach I would say. So, with that in hand, a reasonable strategy design question could perhaps be stated as follows: \u201cAs Return Strategy Component, Maker wants to engage with Credit Assets & Managers, that maximize yield, given min surplus capital buffer/risk budget requirement (i.e. only leaving tail-risks/systemic risk that can\u2019t be diversified or structured away at any reasonable cost) and min skill required internally yet professionally evaluated, monitored and managed (i.e. reliable 3rd party verification of credit possible and reliable partner to manage relationship).\u201d A Maker structure to achieve the Minimum Surplus Buffer/Risk Budget requirements could look like this - fitting somewhat in parallel with the current structure for crypto collateral:   Each RWA credit engagement should be encapsulated in an expected zero-loss construct a la how each crypto vault engagement essentially today is designed (through risk evaluation, factor settings and auction mechanism).   The Maker RWA return strategy assets must build up a risk capital Surplus Buffer amount to pay for extreme events/black swans mitigation efforts (perhaps a antifragile options program). Potentially with a dynamic charging model to underpin a necessary increase in DSR in the future (from inflation?).   RWA Extreme Event risk/tail risk must be considered for all RWA credit risk engagements including correlation with crypto extreme event risks. A framework for this should be established. This essentially should be the only risk that is passed onwards from the collateral vault core mechanics - both RWA and Crypto - to the Maker Protocol.   I\u2019ll dig into E(L)=0 Vaults and Extreme Events conditions shortly. This process would accomplish the Minimum Internal Skill, yet professional management Requirements:   Portfolio CU\u2019s, based upon overall Asset Allocation (more on this later), set up RFP for various credit asset slots needed to fulfill strategy. Responses to these will be prioritized over non-strategy aligned collateral/investment proposals. (to ensure Portfolio CU limited resources focused on most pressing issues)   Each RFP response/Application must come with at least 1 independent party validation of credit asset class and manager. (to raise the minimum bar for application)   Portfolio CU performs initial triage of application and proposes yes/no - primarily on the strength of the independent party review, and then a DAO green light process. (to give a bit more teeth to this process)   Given greenlight, the Portfolio CU undertakes a review assisted by external independent experts on credit class - at least a legal review (with Legal CU) and a credit process and stress test from external parties with substantial experience in the specific asset class. Compliance CU must review the results also. Portfolio CU develops a recommendation. In this process, Portfolio CU and Compliance Unit must also appoint an appropriate external party to monitor the credit manager (i.e. review reporting and physical audit quarterly).   DAO executive Vote.   Please see above process purely as illustrative and directional. I am confident the RWA CU will find its own way. I just want to press the process for two key characteristics:   I think a process with a higher bar for applications and more direction on credit characteristics (outcome expectation and risk framework) will help dramatically.   I believe a substantial increase in usage of external party expertise would help:    allow RWA CU to stay more Credit Generalist than Specialists - a strategy deployed these days in many funds accessing multiple credit classes as very large scale required to build serious local credit class expertise; gain access to a broader base of specialist knowledge that will ensure we have better and constant direct market contact and insights on a continual basis Make recommendations/decisions better from having more disconnected/independent parties involved in the review and discussions.  My only 2 cents on the process in this document.  Sidenote: Max and Min Yield? I wrote max yield above, but I suppose one could argue for a desired minimum yield also? A simple benchmark figure could be ETH-A - the dominant collateral today - stability fee. I.e. The target yield/stability fee for credit assets under this strategy must deliver on par or above ETH-A vaults. I.e. 2.5% ? We could also say that the minimum benchmark is 2%, because that is generally the long-term inflationary target for most central banks in the world (or at least those I\u2019d be willing to listen to). We could also say that it\u2019s 2%, where 1% is contribution to Surplus Buffer for extreme events risks and 1% is contribution to Maker operations. None of the above are particularly scientific arguments, but I think you will find that most arguments one can come up with - within a return strategy - leaves you with a 2%+ requirement on yield for credit assets. Under the inflation argument one could argue for even further given current developments - somewhat related to how the DSR should respond to inflation.  1145\u00d7534 65.7 KB   1119\u00d7657 65.5 KB  I don\u2019t have a good answer here, but I think it should be thought about.  E(L) = 0 Vaults I think a picture will make this more clear. Some of you may easily have seen this before in credit/banking textbooks. It simply shows the loss probability curve for increasing levels of losses on a credit portfolio - and underneath the curve I have noted the \u2018stack\u2019 of loss protection usually in place. I have split into hard value items (i.e. reserves, junior capital, etc) and \u2018soft\u2019 value items which are all the covenant and condition items that provide additional measures of protection. (and I hope the E(L)=0 is understood as alluding to the fact that Maker does not expect to see any losses on its senior position in a any given lending structure within a reasonable confidence interval)  1600\u00d7876 119 KB  I hope it quite clearly shows where Maker, as I see it, should wish to be in terms of exposure, and the credit decision that Maker would sit with in respect of any RWA vault setup - irrespective of what sort of credit asset class we are thinking about: 1. Does the loss protection stack and loss buffers ensure Maker won\u2019t see losses with a 99.9%/99.97% likelihood? And only, as such, sit with the tail-risk? 2. Does Maker understand, accept and reasonably mitigate for the remaining tail-risk?*** This, to me, seems like the right way to think about the situation and mirror well the crypto-vault situation. And I think the framework works for listed credit as much as it works for private credit. More on 2. in the next section, but let\u2019s just turn to 1. Making this sort of call is, unfortunately, not just math. Sure, scenario simulations must be done based upon past loan tapes to stress test the portfolio to work with the specified confidence interval etc, but there are so many other pieces that need to be looked at to come to a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative opinion. In effect you need experts in each unique field. So many things you can so easily get wrong. For instance I\u2019d happily profess to be skilled at evaluating SME lenders in the UK, but not in Germany or USA - or even regulated UK consumer credit for that matter without substantial professional help - and even within SME lenders in the UK I will from time to time require expert help if new security class is to be considered (agri-equipment for instance - I\u2019d certainly need help to think about asset and the economics of the underlying business). It is quite a fine-grained expertise one needs to gain a complete, appropriate, fair and safe review. And then, of course, you need continued monitoring to ensure that the credit asset is performing as it should and doesn\u2019t get out of performance bounds. My point here is that:   Hard to standardize credit asset review beyond a few key laundry lists and some required analytical tools and thresholds - much of the important stuff sits within expert brains. You can see this in some of the research done on investment performance for investment teams moving between investment companies: investment performance stability sits and moves with the team - not with the company - impossible to institutionalize. We need access to a deep well of experts to do well in this field.   As a result it is therefore expensive to onboard a new credit asset class. You need substantial external advice to get it right - and potentially also expert help in monitoring. Which again, sort of dictates, unfortunately, that onboarding usually is focused on expected highly scalable credit classes and long-term partnerships. I am thinking the Arranger ideas might be structured to operationalize some of this, but not in this document.   Merely as points of reference - to see the size and scope of things - here\u2019s a list what we go through when Monetalis onboarding lenders and put it forward to our credit committee. And here\u2019s our monitoring process  Extreme Events/Tail-risks So, if you\u2019re a bank, this sort of tail risk discussion can end with; \u2018\u2026and this is when the government will bail us out\u2019 - and if you\u2019re a central bank it\u2019s \u2018\u2026and this when we print a whole lot of extra money\u2019. With Maker the end is closer to \u2018\u2026and this is when the last man turns off the lights\u2019. So we probably have to give it a bit of thought. I took this below chart from PIMCO, just to illustrate that extreme events in the RWA world are perhaps more probable than usually assumed (this chart was made before CoVid, otherwise it would be on this list also!). Tails are \u201cfatter\u201d.  1100\u00d7460 172 KB  Assuming we have been prudent in accomplishing E(L)=0 Vaults setups, we can now look at underlying systemic risk per vault and in aggregate. We assume that each vault is developing appropriately diversified portfolios within their relevant credit classes (otherwise our task gets more complex), truly leaving only systemic risk for us to consider. As we map this out we can start identifying which systemic failures we need to worry about. This is a bit of work to actually do and so I won\u2019t do it here, but suggest a kind community member or CU does it. We now, I\u2019d suggest, have two levers at our disposal for mitigation of this risk:   We can adjust aggregate portfolio make-up - i.e. constrain certain systemic risk in our overall portfolio. (for instance how big a part of the portfolio should be coupled with the listed and publicly traded complex instrument market? And as such be exposed to complex market contagions? How big a part should remain decoupled from the overall financial markets, but rather connected directly to real actual hard assets? How much should be connected to global trade vs local asset appreciation? etc)   Buy Antifragile Options. We\u2019re here borrowing from Taleb\u2019s work on tailrisk. Basically there is no way we can develop a cash reserve/Surplus Buffer to meet tail risk/extreme events. So instead we use a part of the yield generated from these assets as a budget for buying (cheap) heavily out of money options that would get heavily in the money should such a tail risk/event occur. Usually a true extreme event will lead to both liquidity and value crisis - the idea is that these options will provide both liquidity and value in such events. See it as an insurance premium.   The end of this risk capital chain we obviously still have MKR token issuance, but, in a real extreme events situation, there is a good chance that such issuance would be at fire sale prices and potentially hard to find enough liquidity to execute a transaction. Thus the mitigation process suggested above. So, to reference the end dialogue above, I think Maker\u2019s should be \u201c\u2026and this is when the antifragile options pay off, and allow us to fight another day\u2026\u201d. How big should this option budget be? What should we be buying? What Systemic risks are we most exposed to? Etc. I don\u2019t have the answer, but this is something that is well worthy of a Maker project in my view. It would improve the Maker \u2018protection\u2019 stack immensely.  Duration, Liquidity, DSR and Return This, of course, concerns only the RWA Yield Vaults. Much of the better, low risk, yield generating private credit opportunities (and much of the traded for that matter) would be illiquid and of multi-year duration. Given appropriate expansion of the RWA Liquidity Vaults to meet short-term liquidity squeezes, the illiquidity and duration should not be a great problem on that account - perhaps rather a stabilizer as it means the commensurate DAI would stay outstanding and not be the victim of short-term market volatility potentially causing DAI supply/demand ebbs and flows. The issue is one of DSR as far as I can tell. Basically agreeing to material levels of say 5 year vault with a fixed stability fee may hamper DSR setting capability (or at least funding such DSR increase). But how much will it hamper? How important is it? What are we willing to pay in \u2018lost yield\u2019 from not moving out on the duration curve? So here - again - as with liquidity vs yield - we have a balance to strike.  Balancing and Active Asset Allocation Liquidity vs yield. Short vs long duration. DSR freedom vs cost. Portfolio Diversification. Systemic risk budget allocations. Etc etc. The balances between these components (and probably more I can\u2019t think of) won\u2019t appear naturally - they require (and deserve) analysis, direction and monitoring. And it truly deserves its own CU. I would suggest doing some initial math on a starting line asset allocation could look like to inform. (if I have some time I will try). Will inform any eligibility criteria and perhaps even help drive some direct RFP discussions.  Operational Structure From the thoughts above, I have made a few additions to the suggested organizational structure in the initial draft report.   Adding an asset allocation CU that should interface strongly with Risk CU so they together can somewhat steer and monitor the balance sheet under the direction of the MKR.   I know there is a suggestion that multiple portfolio mgmt CU\u2019s should be set-up/incubated based upon asset classes etc. I agree entirely. I would, however, suggest a first split into the two barbell investment strategies commented on above might make good sense.   Added the Tail-risk CU. I personally have rather high hopes for what this sort of CU could achieve for Maker. I think it is very worthwhile getting deep into.    1331\u00d7898 69.8 KB   Connecting Today with Tomorrow You have probably noticed that this strategy/concept connects - I hope - quite well today\u2019s state of affairs in Maker on both the crypto-side of things as well as the current RWA executions and applications. For instance, as far as I can see, Centrifuge has been working in the RWA Yield strategy segment - and probably that engagement could be analysed and considered as such. Also, as far as I can see, Maker hasn\u2019t done too much to date under the RWA Liquid strategy - but I see many preparations for moving on that.  Where do we fish? The problem with this question is that it has a tendency to become a \u2018I like green and you like blue\u2019 discussion. The discussion - and ultimately recommendation - needs to be grounded in first principles coming from doing the work dictated in whatever asset strategy model we choose to use for Maker. I.e.  What yield and durations are we targeting? How much of an allocation per said yield/duration etc? What size of slots? What diversification are we looking for? What tail-risks are we willing to budget for? What requirements do we have around ensuring a Vault is E(L) = 0? Etc.  On the surface I\u2019d suggest inviting any credit manager to submit a proposal to take up any of the identified slots and convince me, he/she securely and scalably can accomplish what we are targeting - and review each on their own merit and potential match with the strategic slots. Making much more deliberate specific credit class recommendations, I wonder if isn\u2019t counterproductive - nobody has sufficient global insights to categorically say UK SME loans are better than Singapore Secured Consumer finance - or that Argentinian vehicle leasing is better than US 2nd charge mortgages Or that listed A-rated Spanish mortgages are better than private market guaranteed US project financing for solar farms. And I am sure there are credit classes out there I haven\u2019t even heard about yet. My vote, right now, would go towards setting what we want in outcome terms. And then letting \u201cthe market\u201d offer up suggestions for how to achieve these outcomes. Arrangers might also help in this process to make this \u201cmarket offering process\u201d more efficient and effective.  So much more to do\u2026 I wanted to write also about the Arranger setup, about how to fit Clean Money into the setup, do some of the initial calculations necessary on asset allocation/duration/yield/risk budget etc, and dig a lot deeper into the systemic risk framework. Also something about compensation/pay for performance in Asset management - and how we solve this. But I am out of time here. I hope community members find a few of my thoughts useful and build on them. I am so very pleased to see the RWA \u201cthinking and execution space\u201d in Maker rapidly expanding. Looking forward to see many others sharing thoughts spurred by the report! ",

I wish I could \u201cLike\u201d this 1000x. Interesting enough, I was reading an op-ed this morning that labels Stablecoins as instruments that lack what Banks have, \u201cstrong banking-relationships\u201d. Hence, when the 2008 crisis occurred\u2013the Federal Reserve rescued Money Market Funds via U.S. banks and their \u201cdealers as intermediaries.\u201d The author reckons Stablecoins like USDC, USDT (Opaque reserves), GUSD, etc., lack pledge-able and eligible collateral, so they won\u2019t be able to rescue each other. Incase of a black-swan event, what type of role should MakerDAO play (if any) in your opinion?     Allan_Pedersen:  sounds like there is a need for setting up something like a US aggregate liquid bond fund type purchasing/selling program - plenty of this available at institutional investor level from many providers - Blackrock, State Street, Pimco, JP Morgan etc.   These type of ETFs have recently been underperforming\u2013do you expect a reversal in the near-term and how will the Tax implications post-liquidations be handled? I imagine per Arranger vehicle?     Allan_Pedersen:  Buy Antifragile Options.   Are you referring to ETH  & BTC options\u2013or, RWF tail risk hedging with deep out-of-the-money options? BTW this can also work for hedging versus ETH gas prices.     Allan_Pedersen:  Where do we fish? The problem with this question is that it has a tendency to become a \u2018I like green and you like blue\u2019 discussion.   I believe this is a nice problem that will be resolve in due time.

                    "content": "Thanks for your post @Allan_Pedersen, so much content and so many inputs that it is difficult for me even to start commenting. The spirit of the initiative that we decided to kick off with SES was exactly this and I am so enthusiastic to see so many accepting the opportunity. I have read and re-read your comments, but I think I will have to re-re-re-read them over the next days. Frankly, however, it is difficult to comment your post given its width and the fact that it comprehends so many topics that go hugely beyond the initial mandate of the RW Sandbox project. In my mind, the RW Sandbox project wanted to be a receiver of many of the principles you are discussing here. At the cost of omitting the precious definition of first principles at the protocol level, we wanted to focus in developing a conservative and solid and institutional way of looking at business credit risk, and business credit risk only. Still, I will try to give my reaction to stimulate the conversation waiting for others to start contributing as well.     Allan_Pedersen:  \u2026We are more like a central bank than a retail/investment bank and therefore we should go for credit assets similar to what central banks would go for\u2026   We consciously adopted the imperfect analogy approach to make the content easier to digest. The space is a continuum, and given that we are re-inventing and re-shuffling several financial primates it is difficult to point to the Protocol as one of the extremes described above. However, it is my belief that Maker should consider itself closer to a ultimate senior lender and let the rest of the value chain organise accordingly. Institutionalisation of vault size, conservatism of the over-collateralisation vs other algo-stables, and relationships with other DeFi modules like AAVE have gone in this direction already. In addition, I believe that starting from the most prudent risk types is a good way of starting given all the risks you highlight in your intervention.     Allan_Pedersen:  win engine RWA? The first part I think the facts dictate is to split the strategy into two - matching the current dual purposes and assets on the current balance sheet: RWA as a stabilizer for the liquidity component and RWA as a balance sheet expansionary force for the yield generating part.   It is impossible, in my view, to cover all the first principles you are indicating in one single report, at least currently. We started with the ambition of drafting a Credit Policy and not a Comprehensive Banking Policy for the protocol. For this reason, we ignored the liquidity and ALM side of the topics that, I agree with you, are of life-and-death importance for the protocol. In the spirit of a division of responsibilities and decentralisation, it is our ambition to create the beginning of a Chief Credit Office, leaving the real of a Chief Financial Office alone. As you know, in modern institutions those elements touch at higher level and through sophisticated internal transfer pricing policies. I believe this to be still far away but I endorse your CTA to start thinking already through those lenses.     Allan_Pedersen:  Now, as far as I can see, there is little logic that would prevent Maker from riding the entire possible risk/return credit curve, given it is well-managed and has appropriate risk capital allocations and controls.   This is a crucial topic, and one where I think there is no right or wrong answer. If we believe in DeFi as a modular and non-exclusive space where various protocols naturally collaborate and align along the (credit) value chain, we don\u2019t know yet what will be the internalisation equilibrium. One thing we could all agree on, however, is that the assumption given it is well-managed and has appropriate risk capital allocations and controls is a big assumption. I feel we are building those checks and balances, and we should proceed with extreme caution. That is why I advocate, strongly, to keep the highest level of prudence in approaching RWAs.     Allan_Pedersen:  \u201cAs Return Strategy Component, Maker wants to engage with Credit Assets & Managers, that maximize yield, given min surplus capital buffer/risk budget requirement (i.e. only leaving tail-risks/systemic risk that can\u2019t be diversified or structured away at any reasonable cost) and min skill required internally yet professionally evaluated, monitored and managed (i.e. reliable 3rd party verification of credit possible and reliable partner to manage relationship).\u201d   I see your vision here, but this is something I do not necessarily agree with. In my view, we should happily give up a few bps of ex ante maximisation to get rid of tail risks that have destructive powers. In finance, we have numerous examples of under-appreciation of tail probabilities, and in an environment where we do not have a lender of last resort in a FED-like institution (we might actually be something closer to such institution) tails can be destructive. I would endorse instead diversifying out business risk even over-paying (in ex ante terms) for such insurance to other actors that are happy to run that risk. I see that later in your report you also seem to think along those lines, hence I believe the initial comment was more a comment of principle rather than pragmatism.     Allan_Pedersen:  The Maker RWA return strategy assets must build up a risk capital Surplus Buffer amount to pay for extreme events/black swans mitigation efforts (perhaps a antifragile options program). Potentially with a dynamic charging model to underpin a necessary increase in DSR in the future (from inflation?)   This is a very interesting point, and one I would love to engage on. However, ICAAP-like conversation on solvency capital and capital allocation in general go beyond the scope of the report, which is establishing a framework for credit risk management for non on-chain / non linear credit types.     Allan_Pedersen:  Please see above process purely as illustrative and directional. I am confident the RWA CU will find its own way. I just want to press the process for two key characteristics:  I think a process with a higher bar for applications and more direction on credit characteristics (outcome expectation and risk framework) will help dramatically. I believe a substantial increase in usage of external party expertise would help:   allow RWA CU to stay more Credit Generalist than Specialists - a strategy deployed these days in many funds accessing multiple credit classes as very large scale required to build serious local credit class expertise; gain access to a broader base of specialist knowledge that will ensure we have better and constant direct market contact and insights on a continual basis Make recommendations/decisions better from having more disconnected/independent parties involved in the review and discussions.    I agree with your view.     Allan_Pedersen:  Sidenote: Max and Min Yield?   Again, for as much as I can find your point fascinating, I am forcing myself to constraint my comments within the mandate of developing a credit risk policy that is subject to an overall capital appetite.     Allan_Pedersen:  I hope it quite clearly shows where Maker, as I see it, should wish to be in terms of exposure, and the credit decision that Maker would sit with in respect of any RWA vault setup - irrespective of what sort of credit asset class we are thinking about:   Although I agree on the principle of agnosticism, in the real world not all underlying collaterals are created the same. I am advocating a principle that goes beyond statistical underwriting and incorporates a more pragmatic prudence on what type of structures and underlying credit assets we could deal with. Although we could in theory put one security lien above another, execution and idiosyncratic risks tend to pile up quickly. I am sure this will change in the future.     Allan_Pedersen:  Hard to standardize credit asset review beyond a few key laundry lists and some required analytical tools and thresholds - much of the important stuff sits within expert brains.   Couldn\u2019t agree more. ",

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate Thanks for reading and thinking about it. Much appreciated. Op-ed That is a big question! I will let the question percolate a bit more. I keep thinking there is some scope for a cross-currency stability union to establish more overall stability and security in the major crypto-currencies - and that the core design of Maker is in fact quite close to the right one for such a union - some way of developing senior cross currency guaranteed \u201cdrawing rights\u201d for times of liquidity and value crisis for individual currencies against certain unique collateral promises (senior loan, currency issuance, equity etc). Obviously, differences in sizes of the various currencies add complication - so do also the general design differences (soft vs fixed peg - and complete transparency vs opacity of the balance sheet).  To some degree the PSM mechanism is a sort of start down this road. I have a sense developing this sort of union type structure is something that could bring a level of black swan protection that the Op-Ed suggest is missing today. But I have to do some more thinking before coming back to you with an appropriate answer. Liquid RWA & Tax I think we structure appropriate vehicles to manage the tax situation - not so worried about that in practical application - would be something like the various arranger structures contemplated designed to get tax efficient returns to Maker. Certainly worried about liquid market asset prices today and inflation - I have no good ideas where these prices or yields are heading even in the shortest of terms! I think we do need to engage with one of the bigger finance houses to develop a program that probably would include a good number of components to manage interest rate risks and liquidity - i.e. not a pure bond or ETF program. Luckily I think we are now at a size, where we should be able to get customised advice and deployment. Antifragile Options I was mainly referring to RWF tail risk hedging via deep out-of-the-money options, but I think your point is a good one. I could easily see the \u2018crypto vaults\u2019 part of the balance sheet considering options for hedging value crypto value risks - I simply don\u2019t know the crypto option markets - how deep and well/cheaply priced they are. I will have a talk with the Risk CU about it. Where to fish? Agreed. I have complete confidence that the community will sort these issues out. ",
