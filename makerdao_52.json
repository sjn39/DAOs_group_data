                    "content": " GovComms Bi-Weekly Update #1  Getting Started, August 2-19  Administrative Update  Accounting & Payroll Core Unit Setup has been coming along slowly. We are in contact with AccountAble and the Professional Employer Organization, but cannot move forward with payroll, software subscriptions, etc. until we have our first Dai disbursement. This month\u2019s budget disbursements have been delayed. Our team promises to publish accounting actuals during the first week of each month. This may be delayed for August since our setup with AccountAble is still not complete.  Hiring an Engagement Lead Our efforts here are shared between GovComms and the Talent CU that\u2019s being incubated under SES. So far they have presented us with a handful of applicants, soon to be interviewed. In parallel, our team did a first interview with at least one other applicant. Applicants are generally few, but I am confident we will find the right person for the role in the coming weeks. Apply for the position here!  Hiring Summary Team Contributors Our Public Call Summary Team has been growing, with the introduction of a few new part-time contributors. Welcome, Andrea, Rody, and Zainab! We are always looking for folks here so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you\u2019d like to contribute! Apply to join us by commenting on this thread!  Work Being Done  Transparency Dashboard Improvements We added team details and resource links to govcomms.makerdao.network (Site may be temporarily down)  Taking Ownership With the official launch of this team, we have already begun taking responsibility for the work outlined in our mandate that was previously being handled by other teams. We now operate:   Forum at a Glance weekly publication. MakerDAO\u2019s Holiday/Time-Off Sheet. Publishing(written versions), final QA, and feedback survey of Maker Relay.    Sharpening Documentation & Workflow Since the launch of the CU, we have added a ton to our public drive. Following the SES team\u2019s example, we created a basic GovComms CU Overview presentation in PowerPoint. Our previous CU overview presentation is on Figma and slightly outdated, so we took the fundamentals and re-crafted them into something basic and fresh for anyone to look through and understand what our team does. Supporting documentation around all our active projects is growing with project plans/descriptions, metrics tracking, and workflow process docs coming into existence.  Starting up Issue Discussion Calls Once we have a full-time Engagement Lead we will move forward more aggressively with issue discussion calls. In the meantime, our team has begun coordinating the first internal issue discussion call around addressing the overconcentration of USDC backing Dai. The intention being that the internal teams review and document all the approaches available and their associated pros/cons/nuances before making this documentation available to the community for further comment. This exercise is being done to understand what the most impactful approaches are and how Maker teams should prioritize them in the coming year.  Starting up a Team Updates Audit In determining what our updates should contain and how we can best align with other teams, we\u2019ve begun documenting the various ways the current Core Units update the community. This project will result in actionable recommendations from our team on how we can all come to closer standards for team updates.  InfoSec Consult Being proactive about data security and the tools we use is important. This week we sat down with Dimitru, a former Foundation Tech-Ops team member, about google drive information security best practices. As many of you know, our team intends to collect identity and contact information for MakerDAO and its stakeholder segments to be used internally for research and outreach projects. Before starting on this, we must hire an Engagement Lead and conduct some research for the best way to operate this project. Likewise, a public MakerDAO people registry is also in the works but will contain very limited, opt-in-only information.  Reddit Overview David met with Mario, our current r/MakerDAO Reddit moderator, to discuss the state of Reddit, trends, and other insights Mario has collected. Expect some documentation to be published in our public drive soon. The goal of this call was to assess Marios ongoing availability and our moderator needs. We do not need anyone new at this time, smooth sailing continues.  Maker Relay Updates Maker Relay got a facelift! We worked with @content-production to implement some major improving changes.  New Banner Style New Information Structure  It\u2019s workflow also got a facelift!  New Maker Relay rocketchat channel.  New Maker Relay Segment Sign-up sheet (internal use).  We encourage Facilitators, CU members, and senior community members to join the #MakerRelay chat. This way coverage of any given topic can be addressed in a single location where all the collaborators can be found.

Contributor Team | Hiring Writers and Quality Assurers Our Public Call Summary Team is always looking for people. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you\u2019re interested in contributing. And yes, it pays! Apply to join us by commenting on this thread! or by reaching out directly to Artem Gordon.  Work Being Done Since the launch of the CU, we have added a ton to our public drive. Supporting documentation around all our active projects is growing with project plans/descriptions, metrics tracking, and workflow process docs coming into existence and being iteratively improved upon.  GnR Call Optimization Last week we worked with GovAlpha to improve the Governance and Risk call. The current format does not scale with the growing number of Core Units. Team update slots have been replaced by Team Discussion Slots. Core Units should no longer aim to provide a general update, but rather should use this time to present pertinent issues and topics related to their work for the purpose of educating and engaging stakeholders. Where can you find status updates from the various teams? On the forum of course!  Emergency Playbook This is in progress and will be for the coming months.  MakerDAO People List We have started an internal people list, with a public version of this resource planned for the near future. The list contains Facilitators, known team members, known part-time contributors, PPG-OMC-001 members, and Recognised Delegates.  Information Output Audit What began as a Team update audit has been expanded to a general \u201cinformation output\u201d audit. The main difference is that we are not isolating written or presented updates. Instead, we are documenting all the ways teams share information. Soon the DAO will have an easier way of comparing Core Unit information sharing practices, and Core Units will learn what they might be doing that others are not, and vice versa. This project may result in actionable recommendations from our team on how we can all come to closer standards for team updates.  Issue Discussion Calls Our team has partnered with Content Production to put forward the first external issue discussion call addressing Delegate Compensation. Huge thanks to the folks who showed up and made the discussion interesting. We also hosted a second internal discussion call addressing the topic of Dai Scaling and reducing USDC dependence. During these calls Core Unit Facilitators reviewed and discussed over 20 different approaches, sharing opinions on the feasibility, pros, cons, and nuances for each. This exercise is being done to understand what the most impactful approaches are and how Maker teams should understand them.  Public Call Summaries The team has upgraded it\u2019s training for contributors! Join us and take the relatively short 2-4 hour paid training to start contributing to MakerDAO as a Writer or Quality Assurer.  Maker Relay Maker Relay continues to receive qualitative improvements. Publishing the written version is being handed off from Tim Black to Artem Gordon this week. Additionally, we are working with Content Production to eventually publish these on the community or official MakerDAO blog.
