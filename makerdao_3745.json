The recording is available at this link: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/lexmaker-1-i-dai-foundation-maker-ip/8528/4 You can see the accompanying slides here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FLlWOeueyyCJ_b7eorLWj-ruRKtQobagwpmGxFyypNM/edit?usp=sharing With this post we are following up on a couple of things from the call. Trust Deed The Trust Deed for Dai Foundation that lays out its mandate can be found here:  drive.google.com    20190621-Trust_Deed_of_Dai_Foundation - Signed.pdf Google Drive file.      Trademark Policy The first tangible deliverable from Dai Foundation in safeguarding is the Trademark Policy which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk7Tyq_Owss0tBOzX_6BhA3fwenUe6wxYKSxO1JcLwY/edit?usp=sharing The aim of this policy is to make the trademarks available for anyone who builds, integrates with and supports the Maker Protocol without unnecessary hindrances while still maintaining the ability to protect against malicious use. We have consulted the policy with a number of people from the community but we are very open for suggestions and questions from you all. Let\u2019s use this forum for all kinds of questions and suggestions that you have for the Dai Foundation. The board will try to be here regularly. If you rather want to reach out to a specific board member, you can reach the following board members via email: Hans Henrik Hoffmeyer - [email\u00a0protected] Jacek Aleksander Czarnecki - [email\u00a0protected] Payam Samarghandi - [email\u00a0protected] S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen - [email\u00a0protected] Wouter Kampmann - [email\u00a0protected] We do hope there will be a good dialogue so there can be broad clarity on the purpose and mandate of the Dai Foundation. /The Dai Foundation board ",

Examples may include a DAO member sponsoring a controversial athlete, charity, politician, or business. This is probably an edge case, but if someone drops some cash to put the DAI or Maker logo on an event/organization with the potential to alienate users/partners, is that allowed? Should it be allowed if it is? It\u2019s a bit of an edge case, but we\u2019re a DAO and you never know what folks may do in a decentralized manner to market Maker ",

For that reason hardcoding the DAO (which may include a malicious attacker) as a final authority into the policy might be wrong.

In that case it will use its best judgment in order to safeguard Dai and Maker-related IP.\u201d Otherwise that\u2019s a much thornier problem. Maybe the Foundation could only have a choice between following governance polls (normal course of operations) and pushing the self-destruct button (in the event of a hostile governance takeover).

                    "content": "So, I\u2019ve finally managed to catch up on the recording. I\u2019m not sure that I have any specific comments regarding trademarks, that seems to be well in hand. I would also like to get a list of all the board members forum accounts so that I can create a \u2018DAI Foundation\u2019 forum group, so that it\u2019s easier for the community to identify you and draw your attention to relevant threads.  My main concerns are around how the DAI Foundation would respond in the event of a non-malicious protocol fork, as raised by @Kurt_Barry in the call. I\u2019m aware that this is an area you are actively working in, which is great, but I\u2019m worried about how this situation would interact with the funding of the DAI Foundation. Basically, if the DAI Foundation is funded by Maker Governance, that means that there are going to be conflicts of interest in the event of a non-malicious protocol fork. In that situation both sides are going to want to retain use of the trademarks, and one or both may not be able to afford to fund the DAI Foundation. Naturally this shouldn\u2019t have a bearing on which \u2018side\u2019 ends up with access to the trademarks - but it may well do if the \u2018correct\u2019 side (assuming there is one) may not be the side with the ability to fund the DAI Foundation. All of this is very edge-casey, but I think it would be good if the DAI Foundation considered denying both sides of any fork use of the trademarks until it becomes clear which is more in line with the DAI Foundation\u2019s principles, especially if it is unclear which fork is the \u2018majority\u2019 fork. Not only will this avoid swift decisions made with potentially incomplete information, but it should also serve as a deterrent against forking the protocol at all.  I\u2019m also slightly concerned about the result if Maker Governance ends up (without forking) moving away from the principles laid out in the DAI Foundation\u2019s trust deed. In this case (if for example Maker Governance decided to start producing propriety code) would the DAI Foundation be forced to deny Maker Governance use of the Maker protocol trademarks? Already even, I believe one of the principles is something along the lines of serving the financial needs of the underserved.  The MakerDAO system shall ensure a high degree of access and distribution to the unbanked and financially underserved\u2026  Well, we\u2019ve raised the dust limit to the point where it\u2019s not entirely clear whether we\u2019re still sticking to that principle, even if we want to. What would constitute a breach of these principles and how would the DAI Foundation react to such a breach if it represented the will of Maker Governance? Furthermore, if the answer to this is that the DAI Foundation will deny the use of the trademarks to Maker Governance, why would Maker Governance agree to fund this Foundation versus spinning up a separate entity that does not expose Maker Governance to this vulnerability? Further-furthermore, even if Maker Governance does at this stage of the project agree to these principles, because the DAI Foundation is funded by Maker Governance, the DAI Foundation will ultimately be unable enforce these principles upon Maker Governance due to the reliance on funding. All governance needs to do is cut funding and wait until the DAI Foundation is depleted of resources and is no longer able to legally defend these trademarks. ",
