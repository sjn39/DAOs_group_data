Pros:  Hopefully disincentivises MKR Holders from providing liquidity that could be used for flash loans and used to attack the Maker Protocol. It may encourage Maker Holders to vote, and become more aware of the risks that come along with providing MKR liquidity to the wider ecosystem.  Cons:  This may reduce MKR Liquidity in the wider ecosystem, making MKR trades harder to execute. Reduced liquidity will make it harder for keepers to acquire MKR for FLAP and FLOP auctions. This has the potential to frustrate or annoy MKR Holders that are currently providing liquidity. This has the potential to drive MKR Holders that are providing MKR Liquidity away from the Maker Protocol.  The title is a simplification of the below statement. Please vote according to that statement and not the title of this thread. Statement + poll follows:     \u201cIn the event of a malicious governance attack that leads to redeployment of the Maker Protocol prior to the introduction of flash loan guards into the governance process, the community and domain teams should do everything possible to burn the MKR involved in the attack, regardless of whether the owner was directly involved in the attack.\u201d - How do you feel about this statement?   Yes, I agree with the above statement. No, I disagree with the above statement. I believe that the above statement should be rephrased and will suggest an alternative below. Abstain     0 voters     This poll will remain open for at least 7 days (2020-11-04T16:00:00Z). After that time, it will either be extended or closed depending on participation.

This signal is more about the intention \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to burn your MKR if it\u2019s used to attack the protocol.\u201d Rather than a concrete proposal on how we would achieve that. And to be honest, I think that helps to achieve the goal despite the uncertainty.     Jiecut:  This seems quite agonistic towards LPs. This signal is open for 7 days, won\u2019t the GSM pause delay be increased to 72 hours by then?   Possibly. If the GSM delay is increased to 72 hours, there is much less risk of a successful governance attack, so LPs should feel more comfortable where they are. It very much depends how much MKR responds to the posts and votes on the current hat. I feel like the community will be fairly antagonistic towards LP\u2019s if there is a successful governance attack that was only possible because of the MKR deposited in AMMs.     Jiecut:  Seems like it should be the responsibility of ALL MKR holders that a malicious proposal that passes doesn\u2019t get executed.   I agree with this generally, and to be honest if there was a successful governance attack that required redeployment I think we would also be having a discussion on whether non-voting holders should keep 100% of their stake in the system.

Hardly something that will change the world. Just have to follow the gov polls and the mandated actors can remove any suspicious result from the executive. If the hat is at risk, we have a bigger problem. Their first action will be to burn most MKR token they don\u2019t control. Not an expert but looking at the contract and if we can burn some MKR token, they can. In any case, MKR tokens can move between the executive and the actual execution I guess. ",

This particular hat didn\u2019t have any nefarious code, but it is evident that a similar approach could be used to elect a malicious hat and cause damage to the protocol. In this sense, any flash-lendable MKR poses a risk. People choose to lend to secondary platforms at their own peril. Note that this risk only manifests if a flash-loan attack does end in emergency shutdown. I also believe there is no other way to uphold the social contract of \u201cmalicious MKR would not be reinstated during a system redeployment\u201d. Because of the above, I think signaling this increases the DAO security by an appreciable amount without much realistic downside. ",
