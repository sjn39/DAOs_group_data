It\u2019s an opportunity to meet face to face where we can relax and shoot the breeze, brainstorm ideas for a long-term vision, to tackle the big issues, collaborate and explore how the Ethereum ecosystem and Web3 technology can help build a better world that we all want to live in. DM me if you\u2019re interested. Best, Jules ",
