                    "content": " Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines, by LFW & Aes  Introduction We wanted to put out an alternative proposal as we were not fully aligned on the MKR allocations proposed in MIP53. The Working Group felt pressure to put something out quickly and some considered a different approach focusing on domain groupings and revising the initial distributions based on them. Changing our approach in the last couple days would\u2019ve led to the working group missing our deadline to the community of May 10th.  How does this benefit MKR Holders? Why distribute MKR at all? Ownership According to numerous academic studies, companies where at least 30% of the shares are owned by a broad-based group of employees, where all employees have access to ownership, and where the concentration of ownership is limited, are more productive, grow faster, and are less likely to go out of business than their counterparts. In Jeff Bezos\u2019s first shareholder letter, he shared Amazon\u2019s fundamental management and decision-making philosophy which included the follow regarding ownership:  \u201cWe will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner \u201d  To maximize the potential of the DAO, we believe everyone working in a CU should have governance rights. We believe that this will be a net benefit to all MKR Holders over the long-term - even if minted MKR exceeds burnt MKR over the next few years. Decentralization The quality of decentralization was what drew many to this project, and is a continued value proposition for the Maker Protocol that should be maintained and nurtured into the future. This value can be increased by spreading MKR more widely among the current and future decentralized workforce. Commitment Our belief is that contributors who believe strongly enough in MakerDAO to be dedicating their working hours to the protocol are more likely to retain the majority of any MKR compensation they earn to use to direct the future of MakerDAO, rather than selling it immediately upon vesting. If this bears out, it means that the majority of MKR compensation is effectively removed from the circulating supply. This belief has held up with many individuals from the projects history. Many of those whom worked in the Maker Foundation have gone on to continue to work for the DAO, in some part due to the MKR they have retained from their time at the Foundation. Smart, driven and committed individuals like these are a critical asset for the DAO and MKR Compensation is a great way to attract and retain these individuals. Crypto-native Risk At a traditional technology startup, the founders and later compensation committees play a large role in determining how much equity, if any, is given to new employees. MakerDAO is in a very unique position with the transition from the centralized foundation winding down by year end to a fully-fledged DAO. Unlike a traditional startup, fully committing to working on MakerDAO comes with additional risks. It is our opinion that these risks warrant increased MKR allocations:  Risks associated with the transition from centralized foundation to DAO Regulatory and compliance risk - do the same laws apply to a DAO as to a traditional company? How would these be applied or enforced? Are individuals potentially liable if they are compensated by the DAO in any way? Even if they are just shitposting? Political risk - countries outright banning cryptocurrencies or stablecoins Smart contract risk Risk of Ethereum not scaling successfully and competitors cloning the Maker Protocol on other blockchains (BSC, SOL, ADA, etc) Risks related to the PSM and over-reliance on stablecoins to maintain the peg Crypto markets have historically had multiyear bear markets followed by short bull markets - it took bitcoin 3.5 years after the peak in late 2013 to reach its prior ATH and 3 years after the most recent peak in late 2017. It\u2019s very possible that any MKR contributors receive could be worth much less than today in a relatively short time period.   Core Components of MKR Compensation Guidelines 1. Domain Approach These guidelines take a higher level approach than other proposals and focus on domains rather than individual core units. We\u2019ve split core units (existing and potential) into both domains and subdomains and given each a suggested relative MKR amount. There are four primary domains and these are as follows:  Engineering - Technical development and support of the Maker Protocol. Risk - Management of risk in multiple areas. Growth - Encouraging growth of the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO. Coordination - Maintaining effectiveness of MakerDAO, its core units, and its governance.  We believe that this domain-level approach is more scalable and future-proof than making guidelines for specific core units, and should highlight the inclusivity of the Core Unit Framework and MKR Compensation. 2. Social Leveling These guidelines propose spreading MKR compensation on a \u2018flatter\u2019 basis than most traditional organizations would consider optimal, with the difference between the highest and lowest recommendation being only 3x. As discussed above, we feel that greater ownership will increase core unit efficiency and increase the decentralization of governance power, both of which are compelling arguments. Additionally, we feel that it is optimal to maintain strong relationships between individual core units given how much their areas of responsibility overlap in the blockchain-industry environment. We feel its important to avoid unecessary stratification of the DAO\u2019s workforce that could impact efficiency, or even cause very real dangers if core unit employees are not aligned with MKR Holders. 3. Multi-phase Guidelines These guidelines propose a multi-phase, \u2018living\u2019 approach to core unit MKR compensation. These guidelines are meant as an initial proposal that can evolve over time, perhaps revised on an annual basis. The flexibility of modifying these guidelines in the future will ensure that MakerDAO can react to a changing market and industry environment. 4. Vesting Requirements These guidelines propose a 1 year cliff, and vesting on a quarterly basis lasting for up to 4 years. We feel that this schedule represents an approximation of the industry standard, and encourages the length of commitment that allows effective transfer of knowledge between personnel. The more forgiving quarterly vesting intervals ensure that no individual feels \u2018handcuffed\u2019 to the DAO for a maximum of 3 months. We want to ensure that the DAO get\u2019s each individual\u2019s best and enthusiastic work - someone marking time to wait out their next cliff will not deliver their best work. 5. Limit to Inequality These guidelines propose a maximum difference in MKR compensated within a Core Unit of 10x, limiting the extreme level of inequity that is observed in traditional organizations. We believe that this guideline will help to prevent abuse of Core Unit personnel by Core Unit Facilitators in the long term. Due to the borderless nature of the DAO\u2019s workforce, it will be possible for facilitators to economise greatly by hiring from locations with a lower cost-of-living. This is a key advantage of a borderless workforce. However, there are limits to the extent that this can be ethically pursued which we believe should be recognised by these guidelines. 6. Separation of Concerns These guidelines propose that applications for Core Unit operating budgets be pursued separately from proposals for Core Unit MKR Compensation. We believe that this separation of concerns encourages good-faith negotiation from both MKR Holders and proposing Core Units. It helps mitigate the impression that MKR Holders arms are being twisted in order to ensure the services of Core Units, and it gives the Core Units a chance to demonstrate their ability to the DAO prior to requesting MKR Compensation. Furthermore, this separation allows for the discussion of a Core Units value separately from tangential concerns such as MKR dilution. We believe that this will ensure budgetary and MKR compensation discussions are less intermingled and more focused - hopefully leading to better outcomes.  Initial Compensation Guidelines Please Note - these MKR values are only to serve as a starting point for discussion and are NOT fixed - there is a massive difference between a team as talented as the '96 Bulls proposing a Core Unit and the '72 Sixers (who only won 11% of their games.) Compensation guidelines should be flexible enough to accomodate both superstar teams and those with less experience but that have shown potential. Ultimately, it is up to governance to evaluate each individual proposal on its merits and determine the appropriate MKR compensation.

We don\u2019t believe this is the best approach, despite some advantages for the following reasons.  We believe it will result in increasing centralization as existing Core Units will not want new Core Units within their domain, as it would mean sharing the MKR allocation. At the least, this is likely to inhibit knowledge sharing and will result in Core Units wanting to absorb new contributors \u2018in-house\u2019 rather than encouraging them to create new core units. We believe it will incentivise Core Units to fight over the fixed amount to be distributed (with all the contention, disagreement and conflict that implies), rather than limiting their arguments for what they believe is fair for themselves. EG: \u201cWe should get more of the pie relative to x because we do much more than them\u201d versus \u201cwe deserve this much MKR because of x, y and z, awesome things we have done.\u201d We believe it will be difficult to determine an appropriate annual cap without having full visibility of upcoming Core Units. While this visibility may be possible in the short-to-medium term, it\u2019s unlikely to be possible in the long-term. We believe an annual cap will restrict governance\u2019s ability to onboard additional Core Units - regardless of how much value they could bring - due to the necessity to keep promises to existing Core Units.  Should we set a MKR cap per Core Unit? We don\u2019t believe this is optimal. Having a fixed MKR cap per Core Unit would disincentivise facilitators from hiring new contributors if it may impact the amount of MKR recieved by them or their long-standing contributors. On the other side, a per-person cap does incentivise Core Unit expansion rather than division because it\u2019s easier to join an existing unit than setup a new one. This could lead to larger core units, rather than more core units. However, in this case there are still incentives for enterprising individuals to become facilitators of new core units due to the individually higher rate of MKR compensation they might recieve. On balance we feel it is better to err on the side of too much expansion than it is to encourage core unit facilitators to keep their employee count low. Should we just give bonuses in DAI? While this might seem attractive now, there is no guarantee that we are going to have significant amounts of surplus DAI when we operate in the future. Addtionally, DAI does not provide the same manner of long-term incentive alignment that vested MKR does. On balance we feel that offering MKR incentives is preferable to offering bonuses only in DAI. Should we just reduce MKR compensation for all units? While some may view these guidelines as larger than they would have preferred to see, there are multiple good reasons to offer Core Units higher MKR compensation. These are covered in more detail in the second section of these guidelines, but to summarize:  There are significant risks to working for a DAO. The strength of the DAO is the number and committment of those working within it. MakerDAO is still an early-stage project, despite its success thus far - this is reflected in the risks and environment in which the Core Units work.  Should we be concerned about members of the DAO receiving enough to retire / leave employment? We don\u2019t believe that this is a significant risk in the near or medium term. While it\u2019s possible that this will happen on an exceptional basis, we believe that a majority of those working for the DAO do so for reasons that are not primarily financial, and that these reasons will remain regardless of compensation. We also believe that \u2018retirement\u2019 for this reason is not necessarily a negative outcome for the DAO. Compensation given in MKR encourages on-going commitment to the protocol, and we expect to see some percentage of those leaving formal employment within the DAO to spin up complementary projects, take a more active role in governance or move on to something else that tangentially benefits the Maker Protocol and MKR Holders. Is protocol alignment only necessary for \u2018critical\u2019 core units? We don\u2019t believe that this is the case. Any core unit employee has opportunities to operate in a manner which negatively impacts the DAO and/or enriches themselves at the expense of the DAO. For this reason alone, we believe alignment is critical for all personnel. Even aside from this aspect, though, we believe that the benefits in terms of commitment and ownership of the protocol recommend the approach of spreading MKR widely among core unit contributors.  Financial Implications - Scenario Analysis I\u2019ve built a basic financial model for Governance to assess the financial impact of the MKR compensation  under various market and interest rate conditions. I encourage everyone to adjust the inputs to what you feel are reasonable estimates.   Base Case  Assumptions  DAI growth moderates but continues and hits an all time high of $6.1B by year end. Interest rates increase modestly over the next couple years and peak at 2.5% in 2024, then decline to 2.25% in 2026.  Conclusion MKR net income and cash flows grow to $534M and $587M by 2026. MKR compensation peaks in 2024 as the last portion of the initial MKR compensation vests (all MKR compensation in 2024 is worth $234M). Total MKR supply excluding the MKR transferred from the Foundation in 2023 is 931K and decreases to 910K by 2026.  Bear Case  Assumptions  DAI growth declines to end the year at $4.65B and falls 50% in 2022 as crypto enters a prolonged bear market Interest rates decrease to 1% and remain there through 2026 DAI expense growth is cut to 5% as costs are reined in to align with market conditions  Conclusion MKR net income and cash flows in 2026 are 53M and $60M respectively. MKR compensation peaks in 2024 at $24.1M and dilution continues but moderates through 2026. Total MKR supply excluding the MKR transferred from the Foundation reaches 940K by 2026 (assumes the DAO uses the Foundation MKR to pay CUs).  Bull Case  Assumptions  DAI resumes growth after a tumultuous summer to end the year at $11.09B and momentum continues in 2022 with DAI outstanding reaching $26.61B. Interest rates decrease linearly by 0.25% per year from 4% starting in 2024.  Conclusion MKR net income and cash flows grow to $7.24B and $7.49B by 2026. MKR compensation peaks in 2024 as the last portion of the initial MKR compensation vests (all MKR compensation in 2024 is worth $1.41B). Total MKR supply excluding the MKR transferred from the Foundation in 2022 is 916K and decreases to 892K by 2026. ",

                    "content": "Just to chime in here before we write up a longer post: after discussing some of the design choices with @Aes a bit more in detail, I personally see the two models as partially the same thing through a different lens, and partially complementary. There are some discrepancies, but they are very small: for example the 4 years length of the program where we have recommended 3 years; and the 3 month vs 6 month vest after the cliff. I also believe some of the values that are expressed may call for an adjustment of the linear regression parameters in the SES proposal to make it flatter; personally I\u2019m all for that. The question is what the effect will be on our competitiveness in the job market. The difference between the two models honestly is more about the perspective from which they are approached. They are very compatible in my view. Now, there are disagreements, not in the plan itself mostly, but in the considerations under \u201crejected guidelines.\u201d The biggest one is the budget cap. While I recognize the challenges that are mentioned with introducing a cap, I think they may be a bit overstated, and I believe a budget cap is needed for strategic and operational reasons that I can explain in more detail later. Other than that, this plan adds more insight on the governance side of things, especially as it relates to cost, which is great. The SES description is more useful as a guideline for individual core units, which was our first focus. One question I have, is if there\u2019s an intention to turn this into a MIP or not. Despite the original title of the SES plan, we are not planning to propose a MIP as of now. Our plan, like this one, are recommended guidelines made from our own perspective. If there would be a MIP, it should be about the budget cap imo. As the OP mentions: it\u2019s ultimately up to the core units to propose their comp, and to the voters to accept or not accept them. Oh, there\u2019s one more disagreement which is about the separation of concerns section, although I suspect than when our incubation program is taken into account, we would also agree. We have accepted as SES to separate the MKR proposal from our original budget MIP, and this is really bad for both sides. It\u2019s just an essential part of the deal between the team and the DAO that is intentionally left in uncertainty until the point where cancelling the deal would have very harmful consequences both for the DAO and the team. Do you really want a Core Unit to quit after X months because they found out voters don\u2019t feel like ratifying their MKR proposal!? That\u2019s just terrible. The alternative that we do support and implement, is to have core units go through a trial like our incubation program. The dynamic is then very different; the whole point of the program is that everything can still change, the team has less independence and responsibility during this time, and there\u2019s the expectation that team will spend a lot of time on figuring things out (read: not be very efficient.) But it does not send the message: \u201cwe expect you to work as a pro team from day one and we\u2019ll think about whether we\u2019ll compensate you fairly sometime later.\u201d ",

If another core unit thinks our method doesn\u2019t make sense, then of course they\u2019re free to propose a different one. To me, our proposal is mostly a guideline for facilitators about how to organize their CU. While this proposal here is mostly a guideline for MKR voters on what should be considered reasonable. And they seem quite compatible. ",

I think taking this approach will fragment and alienate many people who would otherwise support the proposal - personally I don\u2019t agree with most of the philosophical arguments presented. That being said, I don\u2019t have a problem with the overall structure (or any structure based on logic or even philosophy for that matter), because ultimately we\u2019re operating in a free market and labor is an asset that needs to be acquired. With that context, I think this is a fine way to do things. BUT a budget cap is a total nonnegotiable for me. With a cap in place, we can disregard philosophical differences, logical disagreements, and move forward with a plan that gets people compensated. I would also not vote for the numbers being presented here, although I know that they are just suggestions. When combined with the base salaries from most of the CU budget proposals, the average worker is being paid ~$400k/yr at current MKR prices.

Yes these guidelines are intended to be submitted through the MIP process. Separating DAI and MKR comp was done to allow inexperienced teams that governance would fund on a \u2018trial\u2019 basis to get their feet wet working in the DAO and start showing the value they provide before requesting MKR comp on day 1.

A budget cap has been suggested by multiple members of the DAO but I haven\u2019t seen a single person suggest an amount. If you believe something is nonnegotiable then propose an amount to cap it at, either in percent or absolute terms. I will note that under the base assumptions, the max dilution across all years is 1.1% which assumes a pretty aggressive growth and re-investment in human capital strategy which is lower than what Amazon\u2019s was last year at 1.4%. If one of the most mature and successful businesses in the world is diluting more than MakerDAO and still finds a need to issue share-based compensation to attract and retain talent then I don\u2019t see why the DAO shouldn\u2019t. Look at the dilution seen at other tech stocks last year - Uber (8%), Lyft (7%), Tesla (14%), Shopify (8.5%), Square (15%). I could go on and on. This brings me to my next point regarding a budget cap. What happens if we set a budget cap and hit that number, then a top tier Core Unit is proposed but requires MKR comp to join the DAO? Do we reject the proposal? Dilution is only a bad thing when the value generated from newly issued shares is lower the amounts issued.

We can debate the need for a cap without expressly defining the cap. It\u2019s a concept first, a number second.

I am not seeing how handing out large amounts of MKR to new Core Units on a perpetual basis is an efficient allocation of capital. Shouldn\u2019t we at least try to get more for less?   So you want to retroactively remove MKR compensation that\u2019s been approved if we reach the cap? So if we\u2019re approaching the cap and a high value team comes along, you would say to the engineering team, \u201cSorry but we have to take some of your MKR away to fund this new CU\u201d? Or are you saying you would take from the rest of the CUs pro-rata? Again I will reiterate:     Aes:  Please Note - these MKR values are only to serve as a starting point for discussion and are NOT fixed - there is a massive difference between a team as talented as the '96 Bulls proposing a Core Unit and the '72 Sixers (who only won 11% of their games.) Compensation guidelines should be flexible enough to accommodate both superstar teams and those with less experience but that have shown potential. Ultimately, it is up to governance to evaluate each individual proposal on its merits and determine the appropriate MKR compensation.   ",

I want to get the best teams and individuals for the lowest price.     Aes:  Each MKR budget proposal should be evaluated on its own merits and this is not intended to be blindly applied to any current or new CU that is proposed.   But the fundamental problem is that there\u2019s no real negotiation. A CU submits an application and has to guess what MKR holders will be okay with. This leaves them with the binary outcome of accepted or rejected, which I actually think is fine. The problem is that a framework creates expectations and the approval by MKR holders of a framework creates an even deeper expectation that that framework will be followed blindly. We either need a budget cap, or a CU that handles compensation negotiations.     Aes:  I just don\u2019t see the value of setting a cap and no one has made any serious efforts to articulate or campaign for one.   Because again this isn\u2019t good negotiating practice. Anyone campaigning for a budget cap will be going against the political will of all of the core units. A true campaign can\u2019t be effective until there\u2019s agreement that a cap should exist, in my opinion.     Aes:  So you want to retroactively remove MKR compensation that\u2019s been approved if we reach the cap? So if we\u2019re approaching the cap and a high value team comes along, you would say to the engineering team, \u201cSorry but we have to take some of your MKR away to fund this new CU\u201d? Or are you saying you would take from the rest of the CUs pro-rata?   Why commit to a specific path? If a high value team comes along, and there\u2019s a fixed amount of MKR to go around, let the MKR holders decide where to take it from. They definitely should not break any promises they\u2019ve made as that would compromise governance itself, so the engineering team would not have to worry given the long term commitment MKR holders have already made. Would I make further long term commitments as a MKR holder? Only with a cap. That way when that high value team comes along, their value can be expressed by us having to raise the cap to accommodate them. ",

The presented domains make some important  assumptions about the organization of the DAO. For example SES doesn\u2019t really fit in any of the domains because it\u2019s set up around a mission and vision rather than a professional function. We\u2019re planning to switch between the presented domains depending on where we think the bottlenecks are. 4 out of 10 team members have an engineering background which we use to spearhead research projects. There\u2019s 2 legal strategists to mostly contribute to the legal risk domain. There is a support aspect and then there is the onboarding of new core units into the ecosystem and grants. Which brings us back to the original point: if this is going to be a MIP, it\u2019s going to be extremely costly to agree on all these details. ",

Any CU that negotiates on behalf of the DAO would have to know the opinion of the whales voting on chain because that\u2019s what really matters. I think it would be beneficial to the DAO if there was a whale coalition of sorts that would negotiate with prospective CUs but some whales choose to be anonymous, some don\u2019t vote, and to my knowledge, few participate in the forums.     g_dip:  Why commit to a specific path?

If we set a cap but then raised it every time a high value CU came along, then in reality there is no hard cap.

                    "content": " Preamble MIP#:56 Title: Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines Author(s): @Aes Contributors: @LongForWisdom Tags: General Type: General Status: RFC Date Proposed: 2021-07-07 Date Ratified: TBA Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip56-alternative-mkr-compensation-guidelines/9230   References Pre-MIP discussion  Sentence Summary MIP56 describes how MKR can be used to attract, retain and align interests of all stakeholders in the MakerDAO community.  Paragraph Summary MIP56 details the five Core Components of the Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines: Domain Approach, Multi-phase Guidelines, Vesting, Limit to Inequity, and Separation of Concerns. MKR amounts listed under the Initial Compensation Guidelines are provided primarily for illustrative purposes and may vary greatly based on a prospective Core Unit team\u2019s experience, expected value, and current market conditions. Estimated financial impact is also included under base, bear, and bull market scenarios with adjustable MKR compensation and other key inputs  Component Summary MIP56c1: MKR Compensation Proposal Requirements Outlines the requirements a Special Purpose Fund must meet to be valid for inclusion in the Governance Cycle. MIP56c2: Domains and Subdomains Lists domains and subdomains and relative MKR amounts  Motivation There are three main reasons to implement MKR compensation; providing governance rights to dedicated DAO CU contributors (ownership), allocating MKR equitably across the DAO (decentralization), and retaining talented contributors  (commitment). Standardizing MKR compensation guidelines will also allow us to scale more efficiently and reduce administrative burden from having to track and account for multiple unique MKR compensation plans. Ownership To maximize the potential of MakerDAO, we believe everyone working in a CU should have governance rights. We believe that this will be a net benefit to all MKR Holders over the long-term - even if minted MKR exceeds burnt MKR over the next few years. Decentralization The quality of decentralization was what drew many to this project, and is a continued value proposition for the Maker Protocol that should be maintained and nurtured into the future. This value can be increased by spreading MKR more widely among the current and future decentralized workforce. Commitment Our belief is that contributors who believe strongly enough in MakerDAO to be dedicating their working hours to the protocol are more likely to retain the majority of any MKR compensation they earn to use to direct the future of MakerDAO, rather than selling it immediately upon vesting. If this bears out, it means that the majority of MKR compensation is effectively removed from the circulating supply. This belief has held up with many individuals from the projects history. Many of those whom worked in the Maker Foundation have gone on to continue to work for the DAO, in some part due to the MKR they have retained from their time at the Foundation. Smart, driven and committed individuals like these are a critical asset for the DAO and MKR Compensation is a great way to attract and retain these individuals.  Specification / Proposal Details MIP56c1: MKR Compensation Proposal Recommendations Details five core components for Core Units to follow when proposing a MKR compensation budget.  Proposed MKR Comp should be justified in relation to one of four primary domains (can be listed as multi-disciplinary where necessary); Engineering, Risk, Growth, or Coordination domains Core Unit MKR Comp should be pursued separately from CU operating budgets - recommendation is to post simultaneously or shortly after operating budgets are requested Vesting will be one year cliff with quarterly vesting thereafter, with a maximum of three years Max MKR an individual will receive is recommended at 10x the lowest individual\u2019s MKR within a CU. This recommendation does not specify that every individual within a CU must receive MKR compensation. Framework will be modified based on community feedback and updated on a quarterly basis once accepted  If a CU decides to not follow these guidelines, Governance should request justification for deviations. MIP56c2 Domains and Subdomains Lists current domains and subdomains for a prospective CU to be listed under. The below amounts (which assume a base of 80 MKR) are relative, presented for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to be fixed amounts. Ultimately it is up to Governance to decide what amounts are appropriate based on the team\u2019s experience, mandate, market value, and whatever other factors they consider important. Primary Domains Engineering - Technical development and support of the Maker Protocol. Risk - Management of risk in multiple areas. Growth - Encouraging growth of the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO. Coordination - Maintaining effectiveness of MakerDAO, its core units, and its governance.

It\u2019s a pretty important function and shouldn\u2019t be considered the least important type of Core Unit.   Any Core Unit is free to propose whatever they feel is appropriate given the scope of the Core Unit, the team\u2019s experience, and market value. As mentioned the outlined values are relative, not fixed, and may fluctuate greatly based on the factors I mentioned, as well as team composition. Some teams are flatter than others (PE) and others may be more hierarchical in nature so the median MKR value within a CU could vary greatly.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Sir, thought about it and GovAlpha should have a multiplier of at least1.2 and Average MKR/person/Year should be somewhere around 90 to 110.

Or, is that something that can be implemented later on? Just wondering.   PE\u2019s budget was ratified at over 2x the value listed in the table after the MKR price more than doubled with very little votes in opposition, so I could certainly see MKR compensation for certain CUs higher than the values listed in the table. I\u2019ll refrain from commenting on any specific CUs. Regarding performance goals, I\u2019ve advocated for DAO-wide performance metrics and still think it\u2019s a great idea long term to further incentivize outstanding achievements (likely in the form of \u2018token\u2019 options on top of the RTUs you mention). Others have raised the argument of it being too early to implement and I understand that perspective - therefore I\u2019d like to revisit periodically (every six months or so) to reconsider implementing. Regarding employee based goals, I think they are up to each CU facilitator based on each CU\u2019s mandate and each contributor\u2019s job responsibilities, but it is something I personally would expect all to have.

Aes:  MKR amounts listed under the Initial Compensation Guidelines are provided primarily for illustrative purposes and may vary greatly based on a prospective Core Unit team\u2019s experience   I wasn\u2019t taking those numbers too seriously. My comment was more about the relative weighting of the multipliers and what they reflected. Regardless, I think I missed the point and would like to share my general thoughts on the proposal. I know it\u2019s meant to be modified with time and feedback and so I believe this is a solid foundation to start from. The categorization of teams is simpler and more intuitive compared to MIP53. Overall I appreciate the simplicity, and letting teams take it beyond the broad strokes these guidelines establish. This MIP gives all Core Units a place to discuss and decide proper weighting between categories of teams while separating out the individual team proposal as its own thing that can deviate from the baseline set here (based on the team experience, performance, etc.) ",

The work of these two Contributors @LongForWisdom and @AES\u2019 work cannot be overstated. These two contributors have done a vast amount of work for the DAO in numerous ways, and we cannot thank them enough. I also think they both know that I enjoy working with them, and I intend to keep doing so in the future, hopefully for a long time.  Financial Implications and Scenario Analysis   This is great. We need more of this. Some of us believe that we need a dedicated Core Unit to build more of these. And @AES has probably all the right skills to do this. (I\u2019m not saying he should do it, but he probably should do it ). We need much more visibility on the financials of the DAO\u2014definitely my favourite part of the fundamental research to build this MIP.  It keeps the conversation going This conversation started some time ago, and a lot of people have contributed with their brains. I believe that it is a crucial topic central to the future development of the DAO.  Where I think this MIP falls short  It feels rushed It went from discussion to MIP in seven days. Is there a specific reason for this?  It is unclear on what MKR holders are voting If the numbers are illustrative, are we voting on the ratios? Or are we voting on the definition of the primary domains? Or we\u2019re voting in the Dai denominated compensation? We all agree that we need some guidelines, which might be a step in the right direction. However\u2026  Guidelines to help Facilitators The idea of having guidelines (or at least @SES-Core-Unit\u2019s view) is to remove hurdles for the teams to focus on what they should be doing: providing value for the DAO. Contributors (including a potential Facilitator with 2+ years of Maker knowledge) have already raised questions about how to proceed with these guidelines. What happens if\u2026  Seniority \u2026my team is composed of an army of interns and entry-level contributors? \u2026my team is composed of senior superstars?  Multi-domain teams \u2026my team is composed of Contributors spanning multiple domains?  Contributors Specific Situation \u2026a person in my team will contribute part-time? \u2026a person in my team wants to contribute more and switch to full-time?  MKR Price \u2026 the price of MKR tanks? The package will become less competitive. At which percentage or change is this reviewed? Or is it every three months? Or six months? Who is going to review it? \u2026the price of MKR skyrockets? Are we going to be handing super-competitive out-of-market packages? Will the MKR holders agree to that? There are topics that might lead to huge disparities within the same Core Unit, let alone across the DAO. Should not a set of guidelines address these questions to serve the current and future teams?  Ignores the conversation As much as I think this discussion is necessary, I am disappointed that it has completely ignored all the points raised in the SES proposal. We intended to design guidelines to help teams while trying to solve potential edge cases. Here is the post, in case that someone missed it.  No feedback from current Facilitators or Contributors This point might be wrong, as I have not spoken to every Facilitator or Contributor (with or without MKR Compensation in place). I have talked to a few, and no one seems to have been consulted to draft this MIP (except for @LongForWisdom, of course).  Snapshot of your vision for the DAO While a lot of people will agree with your ratios, some might not. Worse, not every voter might infer that fixing the MKR Compensation in a certain way shapes the vision of how the DAO should be shaped. @wouter has already articulated this idea, so I won\u2019t make this post unnecessarily longer by repeating it.  Conclusion While I agree with the motivation behind the MIP and some of the guiding principles, I feel that it falls short of its noble intention. ",

                    "content": "    williamr:  What would happen to additional core units? There are a few in the queue.   We believe the primary domains would capture most of the upcoming CUs - looking at what\u2019s in formal submission, Content Production and Strategic Marcoms would fall under Growth (Marketing), CES would fall under Engineering, and GovCom would fall under Coordination. Our intent was not to create an exhaustive list of every CU and allocate specific MKR amounts to them, but to provide categories that would cover most prospective CUs.     juan:  It went from discussion to MIP in seven days. Is there a specific reason for this?   MKR Compensation has been actively discussed for several months now between Planet\u2019s proposal, the SES proposal, and within CU budget threads. Multiple Core Units have not proposed any MKR compensation yet and others are mixing and matching existing proposals. Lacking standardization is an issue both from attracting talent and tracking our financials. As Winston Churchill said, \u201cPerfection is the enemy of progress\u201d so we decided to move this proposal forward.     juan:  It is unclear on what MKR holders are voting If the numbers are illustrative, are we voting on the ratios? Or are we voting on the definition of the primary domains? Or we\u2019re voting in the Dai denominated compensation?   MKR holders are voting on the six Core Components listed under specification. To summarize:  Proposed MKR Comp must be listed under one of four primary domains Core Unit MKR Comp must be pursued separately from CU operating budgets Vesting will be one year cliff with quarterly vesting thereafter, with a maximum of four years Flatter and more equitable distribution will be used compared to traditional corporate structures No individual will receive more than 10x the lowest individual\u2019s MKR within a CU Framework will be modified based on community feedback and updated regularly  Regarding the last point - there are multiple ways we are already thinking through to improve the guidelines.  One key issue raised in the discussion thread, is how we can effectively have a CU \u2018negotiate\u2019 their compensation with the DAO. Currently, the decision comes down to an on-chain vote with a binary outcome which I don\u2019t think is great for either party. I\u2019d love some suggestions for how this can be improved. I\u2019ve considered adding a polling requirement for each MKR comp proposal with different voting options (requested amount is too high, too low, appropriate) but am undecided on how to implement. Another guideline I think we should consider implementing is requiring each MKR proposal to include a peer compensation analysis. This would give the DAO an understanding of how the CU is calculating their compensation and what peers are most appropriate. This would be easy to implement for CUs that align with existing functions (engineering, sales, risk) but a challenge for other CUs (governance, SES). Lastly, we considered requiring each CU to disclose the number of facilitators/team leads, senior contributors, and junior contributors with corresponding MKR amounts for each.      juan:  What happens if\u2026   The guidelines are intended to be flexible for the reasons you mention - team seniority, domain applicability, etc. to be able to accommodate both superstar and junior teams. We specifically addressed this in the discussion thread:  Compensation guidelines should be flexible enough to accomodate both superstar teams and those with less experience but that have shown potential. Ultimately, it is up to governance to evaluate each individual proposal on its merits and determine the appropriate MKR compensation.  The MKR per person is based on FTEs, I will clarify in the OP. Someone switching from part to full-time would receive a pro-rata allocation based on commitment then the full allocation after converting.     juan:  \u2026 the price of MKR tanks? The package will become less competitive. At which percentage or change is this reviewed? Or is it every three months? Or six months? Who is going to review it? \u2026the price of MKR skyrockets? Are we going to be handing super-competitive out-of-market packages? Will the MKR holders agree to that? There are topics that might lead to huge disparities within the same Core Unit, let alone across the DAO. Should not a set of guidelines address these questions to serve the current and future teams?   This is the nature of equity-like compensation packages - it is a trade-off between guaranteed, fixed compensation and variable, high-risk high-reward compensation.     juan:  Ignores the conversation   As we\u2019ve discussed I am in agreement with much of what SES has proposed. In fact, most CUs could use the MKR compensation formula SES provided to come up with base values for their team. We\u2019ve opted to move something forward that focuses on simplicity and flexibility both for the facilitators and DAO rather than detailing all potential problems and solutions.     juan:  While a lot of people will agree with your ratios, some might not. Worse, not every voter might infer that fixing the MKR Compensation in a certain way shapes the vision of how the DAO should be shaped.   I\u2019m not sure what you mean, we\u2019ve stated multiple times that the MKR compensation listed is NOT fixed, and dependent on each individual team\u2019s experience, mandate, market value, etc. You could have a superstar team that receives more than 2x a listed amount and one that receives half within the same subdomain and that could be perfectly reasonable depending on the specifics of that CU. Appreciate the feedback and look forward to your thoughts on the additional potential guidelines and other areas the proposal can be improved. ",

Aes:   Proposed MKR Comp must be listed under one of four primary domains    The purpose of this is unclear. As an indication of the average MKR amount per team member, it\u2019s not useful because that would require the team configuration to be defined. It\u2019s understood that the amounts are relative, but not to what. What\u2019s the baseline, a team of seniors, juniors, in what FTE proportion? Which profiles: engineers, lawyers, analysts, support, accounting? If this baseline isn\u2019t defined, it\u2019s not useful to define amounts. Purely as an accounting category, it\u2019s fine. But that has little to do with MKR comp as it would apply to the entire budget. If we want accounting categories, let\u2019s vote on accounting categories.     Aes:   Core Unit MKR Comp must be pursued separately from CU operating budget    This is okay if the MKR comp is part of the original set of MIPs. So, separate but simultaneous. If it isn\u2019t simultaneous, it\u2019s a bad idea. You don\u2019t hire an entire team and leave a substantial amount of their comp up in the air. The original motivation was that, else, \u201cMKR voters arms get twisted.\u201d The opposite is the case. Negotiating MKR comp once the team is already up and running is twisting the CU\u2019s arm and deals more damage if a team that already started, decides to stop because they don\u2019t agree with the MKR comp. Or it falls apart because certain team members quit because the MKR comp is lower than expected.     Aes:   Vesting will be one year cliff with quarterly vesting thereafter, with a maximum of four years    4 years is too long in a volatile environment like crypto. I suggest to reduce the maximum to 3 years so that we avoid a situation where governance practically has to fire a team because their bonus is unacceptably high after 3 years.     Aes:   Flatter and more equitable distribution will be used compared to traditional corporate structures    This is vague and doesn\u2019t have any concrete consequences. Propose to leave it out.     Aes:   No individual will receive more than 10x the lowest individual\u2019s MKR within a CU    This is concrete. It\u2019s unclear how this will be checked, if at all. And it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s necessary for governance to meddle in CUs\u2019 affairs like this. With all the challenges before us to agree on details that we have to agree on, should we be voting in MIPs that define rules that aren\u2019t really necessary to agree on? From the DAO\u2019s point of view, the average and total MKR expenditure matters and what it gets in return.     Aes:   Framework will be modified based on community feedback and updated regularly    For this one it would be useful to define a term. Will the amounts be reviewed on a quarterly basis or a different cadence? How will the amounts be voted on? \u2014 Overall, this proposal tries to oversimplify something that is inherently more complex. We should try and make things as simple as possible but not simpler because then we just end up with the original complexity anyway, plus a broken model. ",

I have talked to a few, and no one seems to have been consulted to draft this MIP (except for @LongForWisdom, of course).   I was but @Aes is in my CU (so maybe unfair, even if I don\u2019t contribute to it). My impression is that it is quite fair, clear, and allows some flexibility with all the specific things we will face (in which linking MKR to an exponential version of the DAI compensation is not great). I see how to craft something that I\u2019m comfortable with. Like Core Units MIPs, this MKR MIP will be extended by what I would call case law (case MIP?). Having the perfect MKR compensation framework is one thing, having the most valuable protocol in DeFi another. I prefer to earn 2x less MKR but work for the most valuable protocol in DeFi. I\u2019m not saying that the multipliers are correct but somewhat reflect the MakerDAO view of the world. i.e. having a good UX and marketing is not important, and I would agree they aren\u2019t in our current mental model. Corporate strategy meets compensation. Not saying it\u2019s for the best (as a hint Apple (UX), Microsoft (sales?), Amazon (operations) are quite in front of Google (tech) in market cap).

This is a huge red flag, as it sets a vision for the DAO disguised in \u201cjust example guidelines\u201d. It kills the possibility of thinking outside the (re)introduced domain box. This doesn\u2019t seem right. It introduces unnecessary rules without weighing the consequences. It adds unnecessary overhead for reviewing guidelines (that are just suggestions).

As a hard-liner against MKR dilution, this is my chief concern with flatter compensation structures. If we\u2019re not lying to ourselves, then there are certain positions that will need MKR for retention under any plan. So a more equitable ratio of MKR between top and bottom compensation simply lifts the floor for those who don\u2019t actually need much or even any MKR to be retained. I think this can be fixed, but don\u2019t have a specific recommendation at hand. If that philosophically is a dealbreaker, then I guess I\u2019ll be in @juan\u2019s camp. But as LFW said, we have lots of time so perhaps we can figure out how to bring the concerns to heel. To be clear: I am in favor of as little MKR distribution as necessary. Note that if a group is being under-resources in DAI, then obviously that and other factors can be considered.

                    "content": "First of all - appreciate all the feedback received thus far. This is my first MIP and the intention was to provide a broad set of guidelines and refine with community feedback. I\u2019m a bit surprised at the level of contention - my understanding was that \u201cRFC\u201d was for receiving community feedback, collaborating and revising a MIP until there was community consensus. If that is not the purpose of submitting a proposal for RFC, please let me know. Let\u2019s not forget the reason the working group was formed in the first place - the community expressed a strong desire for a standardized structure. Initially there was desire for the working group to set compensation amounts for each CU. Due to the complexity and numerous issues identified throughout the process we decided to focus on building broad guidelines and to let Governance determine the appropriate MKR compensation for each CU directly based on each individual proposal.     wouter:  The purpose of this is unclear.   Purpose of Domains is to set guidelines for relative values to act as an anchor point in subsequent proposals. However, as mentioned multiple times in the proposal and comments, it is up to Governance to decide what each CU budget is appropriate.     wouter:  What\u2019s the baseline, a team of seniors, juniors, in what FTE proportion?   Baseline values assume each team is the same structure. As mentioned in my prior post, we have considered adding a requirement for each proposal to disclose MKR received for each level within their CUs as this will provide better transparency to the DAO and allow them to determine a fair number based on team structure.     wouter:  This is okay if the MKR comp is part of the original set of MIPs. So, separate but simultaneous.   Best practice would be to submit the request for MKR compensation simultaneously with the DAI compensation or shortly thereafter. Allowing MKR to be requested later allows the DAO to hire and evaluate a new CUs contributions prior to making a larger investing (essentially a proof of concept).     wouter:  4 years is too long in a volatile environment like crypto. I suggest to reduce the maximum to 3 years so that we avoid a situation where governance practically has to fire a team because their bonus is unacceptably high after 3 years.   I agree and have revised.     wouter:  This is vague and doesn\u2019t have any concrete consequences. Propose to leave it out.   Removed.     wouter:  This is concrete. It\u2019s unclear how this will be checked, if at all. And it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s necessary for governance to meddle in CUs\u2019 affairs like this. With all the challenges before us to agree on details that we have to agree on, should we be voting in MIPs that define rules that aren\u2019t really necessary to agree on? From the DAO\u2019s point of view, the average and total MKR expenditure matters and what it gets in return.   Max MKR an individual will receive is recommended at 10x the lowest individual\u2019s MKR within a CU. This recommendation does not specify that every individual within a CU must receive MKR compensation. We believe it would benefit the DAO to understand the team structure and the market rate for CU contributors.     wouter:  For this one it would be useful to define a term. Will the amounts be reviewed on a quarterly basis or a different cadence? How will the amounts be voted on?   The MKR amounts are outside the scope of this MIP and will fluctuate from the anchor values significantly based on team experience, mandate, market value (of the team and MKR price), and any other factors Governance deems are important. Regarding the domains, I am certainly open to adjusting anchor values and adding new ones when necessary. We could certainly take a poll or discuss ways of doing it, but since it ultimately doesn\u2019t dictate what any CU will receive I\u2019m not sure how much value that would add.     juan:  \u201cLet\u2019s put in numbers, when the Community questions them say that they\u2019re just examples, and once they\u2019re voted in we will say that they were actually not examples, but strong suggestions\u201d.   I\u2019m not sure how I could be more clear that the table is for illustrative purposes and not recommendations for what CUs should receive. It\u2019s listed before the table in both the discussion and MIP. Frankly, I debated including a table at all because I knew there would be people who would skip over the text and go straight to the table. I will bold and highlight the section for visibility. We decided to include the table primarily due to feedback received and also to show the financial impact of the plan (or any plan if one wants to adjust the MKR amounts to reflect what they feel each domain/CU should receive) which was requested by many community members. This was absent from all other proposals. These guidelines do not prevent any CU from being multi-disciplinary, I will clarify in the text.     juan:  As guidelines, they fall short of helping the future Facilitators. They probably introduce more confusion (as Contributors with a ton of experience are still wondering about the interpretation).   Fortunately we are in the RFC phase and the guidelines can be revised prior to submission. I will clarify in the text, but the MIP recommends following a simply five step checklist: Guideline (Recommendation) Checklist:  Proposed MKR Comp should be justified in relation to one of four primary domains (can be listed as multi-disciplinary where necessary) Core Unit MKR Comp should be pursued separately from CU operating budgets - recommendation is to post simultaneously or shortly after operating budgets are requested Vesting will be one year cliff with quarterly vesting thereafter, with a maximum of three years Max MKR an individual will receive is recommended at 10x the lowest individual\u2019s MKR within a CU. This recommendation does not specify that every individual within a CU must receive MKR compensation. Framework will be modified based on community feedback and updated on a quarterly basis once accepted  To re-iterate, if a CU decides to not follow these guidelines, Governance should request justification for deviations.     juan:  It overspends MKR, as the most junior, part-time position needs to be 1/10th of a superstar (this is not Ben & Jerry\u2019s).   I do not understand how it overspends MKR on junior resources, unless you feel junior resources shouldn\u2019t receive any MKR at all, which would be surprising to me since you were supportive of interns receiving MKR comp. If a facilitator of a CU was making $50K-$300K in MKR per year, I don\u2019t really see paying a junior resource $5K-$30K as overpaying. From my research this is on par and even less than what many tech firms pay for junior resources for bonuses. If you could provide an example where this is overpaying and what you think is reasonable, I would be happy to consider revising.     PaperImperium:  As a hard-liner against MKR dilution, this is my chief concern with flatter compensation structures. If we\u2019re not lying to ourselves, then there are certain positions that will need MKR for retention under any plan. So a more equitable ratio of MKR between top and bottom compensation simply lifts the floor for those who don\u2019t actually need much or even any MKR to be retained.   I\u2019ve edited the post to clarify that there is no requirement or recommendation to provide MKR compensation to every individual within a CU. For those that do, the 10x multiplier is still a recommendation and a proposal could certainly justify a higher multiple. ",

All CUs are receiving generous salaries and will not be going without compensation during the delay.   The original working group attempted to actively engage large and small stakeholders as well as a third party to assist with the development of a plan. If you go back to the volunteer threads, there were very few volunteers for the large and third party stakeholders. I\u2019m not sure how delegation will solve the lack of participation on the forums or development of a MKR compensation proposal. Also to re-iterate, this proposal does not give CUs any amount of MKR compensation, they are simply broad guidelines intended to bring standardization, transparency to the DAO, scalability, and aid negotiations between the CUs and DAO.

I want to avoid providing direct feedback on this or any proposal from this point on. I really believe that this is a job for delegates. My logic for that is that these frameworks and the ultimate compensation they result in do not have a high level of urgency (unlike stability fee adjustments and other governance), but do potentially have high long term impact. It just seems prudent to fill the gaps in the governance process before trying to pass something like this. If I correctly understand the timeline presented by the PE team, these delegates will be here quite soon. Is there any reason you wouldn\u2019t want to wait? I think the entire community will have a better experience if high-importance frameworks like this are negotiated directly with the MKR holder representatives, rather than trying to guess the preferences of the MKR holders by sourcing feedback primarily with the community.

In my mind, the alternative is to delay all future MKR compensation or compensation frameworks until there are delegates who can directly interface with their sponsors. Like I said, I personally believe that all of the current salaries are generous enough where we will not have any attrition due to the minor delay. Also, the Protocol Engineering team already has their MKR comp negotiated, and that\u2019s likely going to make up the bulk of the payments anyway. This differs from delegation because delegates are directly accountable to the MKR holders while working groups and other elected actors in the community are only tangentially accountable. For example, MKR holders are not able to \u201cunstake\u201d from this group without one of them proactively putting up a MIP to do so, and if they were willing/able to put up MIPs we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation - hence the need for the delegates.

Example Engineering - Protocol gets 1.5 multiplier so they basically get 180K DAI/yr salary and 270K/yr MKR - on average\u2026 My question is related to whether the MKR vesting with this MIP56 is basically modulated by trailing price so that basically this E - P person basically makes no more than 450K/yr with vesting MKR. Second question.   Why isn\u2019t this MKR vesting option to buy with the 6 month trailing option as the strike price?  vs. what is done here (MKR basically given as additional compensation in addition to salary)? This makes a huge difference to the contractor and the protocol in that for a contractor to earn a bonus on their vesting options the protocol price has to go up.   With these options the contractor always makes a bonus on top of their base salary in MKR. I am confused by how paying 180K/yr for a Legal person (low imo), and 180K/yr for communications vs. 180K/yr for a Engineer reflects the real salaries.   I mean if a Protocol Engineer can make 500K/yr somewhere else why would they come or stay here same with qualified and experienced legal. I don\u2019t understand how a multiplier on MKR vesting rewards is going to compensate positions that can command higher pay to come here because no-one is going to take a pay hit from 250K/yr to come work for Maker at 180K/yr just to earn the extra 270K/yr MKR.  I mean maybe they would but that 250K/yr job is also going to come with some nice bennies too. What I really wanted to understand was forward looking CU MKR reward budget requests in light of MKR price appreciation 3-5x and whether this will mean there will be extra MKR left over in CU MKR rewards budgets or not. I guess my primary question is why isn\u2019t the MKR reward bonus just a flat across the board 1-1.5x salary for everyone.  I mean then Engineering will automatically get more rewards, Legal probably second, Growth third, risk and governance 4th etc. I really would like to see these rewards as options with 6 month trailing MKR price strikes btw. as this then aligns worker bonuses with MKR token price increases.

Thank you for the link to this it was helpful.   I will have to look back but I don\u2019t think I saw this as a reference or even a comment in any of the compensation documents.  I could have missed it though. I think my biggest concern is sustainability here.  While I understand contractors will want secure long term contracts around pay I think the only way to assure this is to design the systems so that the terms around this \u2018can be sustained\u2019 by system financial construction. I have been noodling a bit on how to make these MKR rewards long term sustainable and after a good fraction of a day have at least one idea so far\u2026 There was one question that came out of my analysis as I was looking for a solution to sustainability here. Are these MKR compensation rewards thought of a bonuses or are they thought of as a competitive salary compensation package?   I mean people look at packages when they are choosing jobs and stock is usually considered a bonus perk and not a salary compensation except in startups where they may not have cash\u2026  So I am wondering whether these rewards are meant to be as a bonus or as partial salary compensation to find/retain key talent.? Thank you for well thought response! ",

It\u2019s important to note though, these top paid software engineers are typically are managing 100+ developers across multiple teams which is why I do not feel like these would be accurate comps.   The issue with this comparison is that in a decentralized environment you will never have someone managing 100+ developers. The model works differently. Leadership is provided not through direct management and reporting lines, but through education, guidance, and protocol governance contributions. So if you are going to look at the number of developers that are managed by someone, and set compensation to those levels, you will only get lower tier managers. Which means you can\u2019t compete. I believe we need to drop that comparison and develop the decentralized equivalents. As I mentioned, the direction we need to look into, in my opinion, is education, guidance, and protocol governance contributions. One thing I believe in is that (successful) dev educators in a decentralized world should be paid more than devs who don\u2019t educate; they are the equivalent of higher level managers in a centralized organization. We need to decompose centralized management into the goals that it\u2019s trying to achieve. And reward those that achieve the equivalent goals in a decentralized environment on the same level.

Considering they literally have the keys to the entire protocol. Would a major change like this be possible in a decentralized way?   Protocol Engineering does not have the keys to the entire protocol, and yes, it is possible to replace them should that be needed \u2013 MakerDAO is truly decentralized today. Of course there are gradations and this is something that we always need to guard by further decentralizing centers of power. But it is already possible today for an external team to come in and, fully independently, run the same operations as Protocol Engineering (or the Oracles CU.) That team would need no one\u2019s permission. That being said, we do need to work on (1) further lowering the barrier to entry, and we need to (2) create real redundancy. It shouldn\u2019t just be possible for there to be a second PE core unit, there should be an actual parallel smart contracts development team. SES has actively been working on this exact problem since day one, together with PECU, in our Sandbox grants project and through our incubation program. We\u2019re not there yet, but significant progress has been made and I believe we\u2019ll see a parallel smart contracts development team within 4 to 8 months. ",

The MKR compensation is designed to attract and retain talent. I personally advocated for performance based rewards to be 1/3 of the total MKR compensation but after discussing with the working group, the consensus was that we were too early to implement. I think this could be revisited over the next few years once the foundation of the DAO has been laid.     Zarevok:  The argument in favor of these high bonuses that I\u2019ve heard is that they need to be high in order to remain competitive however truthfully I\u2019ve personally not seen anyone provide examples that justify the compensation.   I\u2019ve outlined my view on the compensation levels here, in the \u201cCrypto-native Risk\u201d section. For people to move from TradFi to DeFi and working for a DAO, there is significantly more risk. In addition to the aforementioned risks, most CU budgets are being proposed for a 3-6 month runway and the DAO can decide to defund them at any time. From a purely numbers perspective, there is significant additional administrative overhead to joining a DAO - creating your own company, getting independent and unsubsidized health care insurance, lack of benefits (401K, T&E budget). I cannot speak for the other CUs and their members but making the decision to join the DAO full time was not an easy one for these reasons. Personally, I am taking a pay cut if I exclude MKR compensation (which has not been proposed for RWF yet) and forgoing a high degree of  financial certainty in traditional FP&A compensation which gets increasingly lucrative and equity weighted with experience (based on compensation levels I\u2019ve seen at Fortune 100 companies).
