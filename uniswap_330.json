At first, we can try to have an election. For ex, we can start delegation or UNI to whoever we wish, at the amounts that we want. The more money you have in this, the more your vote counts, like regular politics. And the 5th of November at 00:00 a snapshot is taken, and the 13 users with the majority of unis delegated became the first senates of UNI. We can then think of forms of them to make proposals and having their separate vote system, all of them can only be senates only one time (that wallet at least), or making them having their own UNI staked for their governance period, maybe more, we can create and modify the rules using the smart contracts. Then, we need another way of voting, for those who aren\u00b4t big enough to swim the ocean, so I think that we could use this platform and use this like what it truly is\u2026 A forum, we can have all the discutions in here and create or own voting system. The first things that we should determine is \u201cwhich users should be allowed to vote?\u201d, and then \u201cwhich users should be allowed to make informal proposals?\u201d. Before going deep on this, I must clarify that I believe that everybody should be allowed to make comments. As an example, I would be ok with the requirement of being a Holder of 400 UNI for +3 months to vote, and to, in addition of that, have being an active member of the community to make a proposal. *Clarification: All the given names and numbers arent thinked, this is more of an invitation to a brain strom.

Politics is one way of making a system, and better than that, the idea of an election will give lot of noise. Money, publicity, memes, we can even host economics-social debates. If we don\u00b4t create a space for them to participate and be interested, banks and politicians will just regulate this into oblivion. ",

Some might want to delegate to a single person (\u201ca monarchy\u201d), others might prefer a DAO with different weighting mechanisms or using L2 solutions, a senate-like system like this, etc. all of which can be implemented as a smart contract. The benefit of this system is that, unlike in real life, if voters no longer trust the system (senate, representative, DAO is corrupted/hacked/etc), it\u2019s power can be removed. Using smart contracts as a tool for governance is already done in Compound with Autonomous Proposals:     Proposal: Adopt Compound's Autonomous Proposals Proposal Discussion       There\u2019s nothing that needs to be done for people to start using these immediately. It doesn\u2019t require a governance proposal.  Anyone who wants to submit one can just deploy this contract and swap out the token + governance address for UNI and UniswapGovernance     ",

I created a separate topic discussing it in detail, I feel like I\u2019m onto something so I would really appreciate any feedback. I believe the procedure is more fair (and fun!) than any type of voting system I\u2019ve ever heard of.

This is something that I have been thinking about a LOT regarding how voting takes place, particularly since I first saw the \u201cUniPig\u201d page\u2026  First off, we don\u2019t want to turn this system into the one we\u2019re trying to step away from.
