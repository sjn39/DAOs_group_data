The grants round starts September 7th and runs till the 22nd!  If you would like to receive a succinct summary of the latest Gitcoin News in your inbox, sign up here!    Hot Topics:   FDD launched the Great Gitcoin Grant Eligibility Hunt on Ethelo. We will release seven sets of grants, one each day. Each set has an open review window of 72 hours. Participants get a limited edition POAP \u2013 your agent badge and key to future events!   Owocki answers the question Who is a cofounder of Gitcoin? The title was offered to multiple people over the years, with a clause that to retain the title they must work at Gitcoin for four years. \u201cAs of August 2022, my interpretation of the above history & neutral reading of these agreements is that Kevin Owocki, Kyle Weiss, and Scott Moore are the current cofounders of Gitcoin.\u201d   Kyle asks for a recap on how partnerships are going. Vishnu shares that they\u2019ve kickstarted a mutual grants committee who have written a methodology for considering mutual grants and reviewed 30 grants based on those criteria. The four criteria are values-alignment, strategic utility, growth potential, and feasibility and effectiveness. Pre-existing mutual grants include PrimeDAO (with whom we\u2019re working on a proposal inverter), DeveloperDAO (who just launched their governance token), and Radicle(with whom we\u2019re currently executing a tokenswap). Outside of mutual grants, Vishnu also highlights that the CLR Fund 40k GTC grant was a \u201cno strings attached gesture\u201d and that we have a long line-up of matching partners. They include Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Momus.Eth, Yearn, Polygon, Aave, and many more.   In his treasury diversification update, Kyle lets us know that $1MM of GTC has been converted to USDC and sent back to the treasury. This will continue until all of the remaining balance of GTC in the account has been diversified. Kyle flags that \u201cthis is a slight deviation from the proposal which stated excess GTC would go back to the treasury.\u201d While outside the proposal, this was approved last week by CSDO.   Latest Episodes from the GreenPill Podcast with Kevin Owocki:   GovernorDAO with Jon Greenwood & Zane Huffman - Green Pill #39. As part of the current series on sybil resistance, learn about a protocol that offers a Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) sandbox for any project to ensure their governance model works out of the box.      Gitcoin Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  Disburse Moonshot Collective Budget [Tally] MMM S15 Budget Proposal [Tally] Withdraw $10MM of GTC to diversify our treasury and increase governance partners [Tally] FDD S15 Budget Proposal [Tally]    Proposal Discussions:   Latest Completed Proposals:   Memes, Merch, and Marketing Season 15 Budget Request 100% Yes    Workstream Discussion:   Public Goods Funding    We\u2019re gearing up for GR15 and are excited to have a main round, 4 cause rounds, and 13 ecosystem rounds! Our partnerships team has been hard at work locking in funders and did a great job raising $2.8M despite being in a bear market.   In GR15, for the first time, we are decoupling eligibility for main and side rounds. Previously, projects needed to be approved for the main round before they could be approved for the platform or for side rounds. Now, we\u2019re giving our partners more control than ever over who\u2019s eligible for quadratic funding. This is a big step towards a protocol world.     Moonshot Collective    Quadratic Voting: We are working on a Product Requirements Document(PRD) to layout goals, stakeholders, projects, and milestones. Once the PRD is complete, the discovery phase can begin in earnest, to figure out the solution/building milestones.   Operations: This week, the MC Operations team reviewed three proposals to address the \u201csuccess themes\u201d of: Cross-Stream Accountability, Initiative Accountability and Idea Intake/Vetting.   Identity Staking: This week the Identity Staking team built out the bulk of the UI for the product. Our smart contract code for Identity Staking is currently being reviewed and audited. We also posted a bounty in Buidl Guidl (open to all, not just Buidl Guidl peeps). By end-of-week, the team aims to complete UI work, finish auditing the Smart Contract code, and to begin doing some user testing on Friday.     Fraud Detection & Defense    J-cook posted a vision for decentralizing Sybil defense and empowering communities to run their own Sybil detection algorithms on top of open datasets, rather than having a monolithic (and centralized) defense strategy. Part of the infrastructure to do this will come naturally with Grants 2.0. But additional infra for analyzing, training models, and making decisions needs to be created and made accessible to as many people as possible.   We are continuing to build labeled datasets of known Sybil users and supporting Gitcoin Passport on stamp scoring mechanisms for GR15.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Programs: We are preparing for GR15 Launch Week! We\u2019ll be pushing out fresh tweets and emails as well as running several events. Check them out in the community events section\ud83d\udc47   Protocols: We\u2019re putting on the finishing touches for Passport marketing materials ahead of GR15 (including our new marketing website) and supporting the Customer Service team to have the Knowledge Base fully updated. We\u2019re also finalizing logos for the Grants Protocol suite (preview coming soon) and creating a roadmap for audience persona analysis.   MMM OS: We\u2019re finalizing a compensation logic model for core contributors and planning to roll this out in in S16. Have you seen our new Notion m-m-m.xyz and updated project tracker?   Content: We published two new blog articles:  \u201cGitcoin: Supporting Builders in Bull and Bear Markets\u201d  \u201c4 Ways Gitcoin Passport Can Help DAOs\u201d.      DAO Operations    [CSDO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEiZu1Jqkqn-axtQdtrNLg): In this week\u2019s CSDO, we discussed whether we will be hosting Schelling Point at EthDenver. We decided to keep bringing this event to people and are still determining who will be running it if the events workstream is unavailable. We also surfaced a tension about how round policies get created and enforced between FDD and PGF. The two teams will touch base and there will be a proposal that can go through a consent-based process.   Our support team has been hard at work upgrading and updating our Knowledge Base ahead of GR15. We\u2019ve been partnering closely with MMM & PGF and are excited that our documentation and videos will answer many grantee questions.     Gitcoin Product Collective    Grants Hub:  We are about 90% production-ready with Grant Hub Phase 2 (Anchor). Our latest demo shows off how you can connect with multiple wallets including Metamask, Rainbow, and Coinbase. You can also see our latest designs for creating a new project on the Hub. Last week, we hosted our Monthly Team Retro. The recap can be found in the #grant-hub channel in the Discord. DM your local Discord admin for access, if needed. Our product team also worked on the first draft of the \u201cProof of Projecthood\u201d product brief. There is an open request for feedback for this draft. View and make comments here. The team is seeking to finalize the brief this week.      Upcoming community events    Check out our Grants Events Calendar!

CSDO has decided to extend Season 15 by one month  to give extra time to prepare for Season 16. CSDO will also be introducing a rotating cadence \u201cbetween \u2018tactical\u2019 and \u2018strategic\u2019 season preparations.\u201d   Latest Episodes from the GreenPill Podcast with Kevin Owocki:   GreenPill #40: Owocki chats with Sam Bankman-Fried(aka \u201cSBF\u201d), founder and CEO of FTX, about effective altruism. Owocki and SBF explore the following questions, \u201cWhat is effective altruism? What\u2019s the driving force behind SBF\u2019s effective altruism philosophy? How can crypto be good for the world? Hear answers to these questions and more in the interview.   GreenPill #41: Kevin is joined by Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink.

Listen here.     Owocki tweeted that there is now a formal process for requesting to work with GitcoinDAO, as he has disaffiliated from DAO leadership(but is still very much present in the Discord and gov forum!).   Owocki recently posted a response to the question, \u201cWho is a co-founder of GitcoinDAO?\u201d. This post is a great read for understanding the evolution and history of Gitcoin, and Kevin explains his rationale with regard to how co-founders Scott and Kyle were chosen.   MCON is happening in Denver, CO, from September 6th-9th. Owocki is speaking on 9/6 at 11a MST/5p UTC on the topic \u201cKumbayah DAOs: How to Defend Your DAO Against Incompetence and Bureaucracy (Lessons Learned)\u201d.

Gitcoin Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.  Active Proposals:  Public Goods Funding S15 Budget Request [Tally] FDD S15 Budget Proposal [Tally]   Proposal Discussions:  None this week.   Latest Completed Proposals:   Withdraw $10MM of GTC to diversify our treasury and increase governance partners [Tally] - 100% For MMM S15 Budget Proposal [Tally]    Workstream Discussion:  Public Goods Funding  It\u2019s an especially busy week as we do the last of our preparations for GR15. We\u2019re locking in the last of our partnerships and securing as much funding as we can for public goods. We\u2019re also making sure we have a smooth process in place for determining side-round eligibility and working with all of our partners to ensure they feel comfortable with the process. We\u2019re making a big push to get these reviews completed before the round starts on Wednesday!   Moonshot Collective    Quadratic Voting:  We ran a kick-off call for Quadratic Voting this week. That was turned into a proper PRD to layout goals, stakeholders, problem, and milestones. The upcoming week will be focused on Discovery (technical and product) to jump start the solution/building milestones.    Operations:  This week we facilitated payments for August. We also created a new proposal for the format for the problem solving request submission process and proposed a process for providing transparency/getting buy in from the DAO regarding what we choose to work on next. Also, a few team MC workstream members will be at MCON in Denver and we are looking forward to connecting IRL.    Identity Staking  This week, in order to get us ready for the launch of Identity Staking, we focused on two things - the Identity Staking UI and the Staking Smart Contract. For our UI work, this week we finished most of the UI work for Identity Staking. We completed three rounds of usability testing and got some feedback that we will make next week. We still have some content updates to make, and we need to spend a little time on the \u201cModify Staking\u201d functionality. For the Staking Smart Contract, we completed our code review with three different developers on the smart contract. We shipped a new smart contract with changes based on feedback for the code review. We will deploy the smart contract next Monday.     Fraud Detection & Defense   GR15 grants are rolling in! FDD has all hands on-deck reviewing eligibility and resolving appeals.   FDD is doubling down on its strategy to enlist the community in Sybil detection. We\u2019re planning hackathons, building self-serve data tools, onboarding new contributors, and forging partnerships with other Sybil defenders in the ecosystem. We\u2019re also working with the Gitcoin Passport team on scoring mechanisms and experiments for GR15.    Merch, Memes & Marketing   Programs  We published a donor Announcement post and sent it over email. The email has over 19K opens in the first 2 hours      Protocols  We have finalized our audience personas for the Grants Protocol and will be releasing 1-pagers in the coming weeks for DAO-wide circulation. We have supported the development of, and written, new Passport articles in the knowledge base - check them out!     MMM OS  Our team has laid out a visualized roadmap of major activities over the next 6 months including details about our marketing campaigns for future grants rounds and the transition to the Grants protocol. We have onboarded all existing contributors to Notion, and created training video and database logic breakdown.    Community Experience  We conducted a deep dive into audience research that is nearing completion - gov post to be released in the next week Our active segment of email subscribers is now at 175k!     DAO Operations   CSDO  We discussed the next edition of Schelling Point, which will normally be taking place again in Denver. We also discussed the ownership of all things grant eligibility, as well as the evolution of community experience and part-time\u2019s contributors\u2019 place in it, and the next steps for \u2018light-versus-heavy\u2019 seasons.    Community Governance  We had a successful retro call with the steward council and are getting ready to elect and announce the next council    Support  We created tons of new knowledge base articles, to offer better support for all things trust bonus and passport. You will be able to find all of them on support.gitcoin.co. We are experimenting with a new discord flow to reduce support tickets by guiding our users first to our knowledge base, where we will hopefully already have covered most questions.    DAO Tooling  We are working on a thorough audit of access to our tools to make sure all of, and only, the right people have access We will be migrating all of our users from Sobol to Notion, to make it easy for existing contributors and curious visitors to get a good view on who is working on what within the DAO    People Ops  We\u2019ve been working on a new and improved Peer Review process in consultation with other workstreams, and this will be ready in time for the next round of peer reviews Our team is working on comp models for each workstream. MMM and FDD have started testing their new models, while MC and DAO Ops are close     Gitcoin Product Collective   Grants Hub  We are targeting to be production-ready with Grant Hub Phase 2 (Anchor) by Friday, September 9th. With this week\u2019s progress, we are about ~95% complete.    Round Manager  We are happy to share that we have officially hit our MVP milestone! You can see our first version of Round Manager live at round-manager.gitcoin.co, which allows you to deploy a round and manage project applications on Optimism and two testnets.    Passport   This week we collaborated with marketing and support on Passport GR15 assets. Knowledge base and announcements are shaping up well. Thanks to MathildaDV.eth and Laura | viriya.eth. We also assisted the engineering team in development leading up to GR15 and worked on details of the GTC and identity staking stamps with @Brent | Gitcoin and Moonshot Collective.

I also plan to engage in DAO governance as any GTC holder would.   Any touch points I have with the DAO should be out in the open, so you\u2019ll see me in the public discord/gov forum channels or on twitter spaces (no private DMs pls, if you DM me i may ask you to ask me a question in a public place). We are treating the DAO and its contributors (or any other of its agents or representatives) like any other third party or potential client - we respect autonomy but respond to inbound inquiries where requested / endeavor to be helpful.

We have been running one grants round per quarter for nearly four years! No small feat. Owocki posted this short thread musing on how far we\u2019ve come in the 3.75 years that Gitcoin has been running grants rounds       From the Governance Forum   \u201cProject Management at GitcoinDAO\u201d\u2013Puncar  Puncar, Tigress, and June co-authored this proposal to standardize project management at Gitcoin. In the proposal, they diagnose current bottlenecks in the DAO\u2019s project management process, and offer recommendations for an improved project and task workflow. Special focus is given to aligning on naming conventions and \u201cusing [the] same statuses when dealing with projects and tasks. This proposal is open for comments and suggestions for the next week. In about two weeks, a final version of the proposal will be presented to CSDO. If the proposal is ratified, this team proposes to spend October working with workstreams to help implement these new standards. Request for Comment: Read the proposal and offer comments + feedback here.    \u201cThe limits of Sybil defense (and how composability might help)\u201d\u2013J. Cook  J. Cook wrote this deep dive about how we might think about the limits of sybil defense. For instance, it\u2019s impossible to design a system to protect against every possible sybil attack \u2013 but is that even necessary? He offers thinking in regard to how composability may provide new solutions for sybil defense, and how Grants 2.0 is working to implement them.

Get the TLDR of the TLDR in the workstream section below   If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!    Hot Topics:   In Future of the Grants Program, Annika presents how \u201cwe envision separating the product, program, and services components of Gitcoin Grants into distinct efforts.\u201d The open source protocol is \u201ca software stack to run & manage your entire grants program by yourself.\u201d The Gitcoin Grants Program you know and love today is \u201clikely to be a super-user of the protocol\u201d that will continue to fund public goods. The protocol will allow for much more though as it will offer services to \u201ceffectively advise funders on how they might deploy capital and help them in deploying that capital through our protocol.\u201d   Based on feedback, Owocki asks \u201cDoes the DAO need a decentralization essential intent?\u201d The DAO could ratify such an essential intent to further it from \u201cits roots as a company\u201d and establish clear guardrails.   Looking at the next 12-18 months, Kyle asks \u201cWhat does Gitcoin look like if we are successful in achieving our Essential Intents?\u201d Today, GTC is primarily used as a governance token to vote on workstream budgets and ratify Grants rounds. In the future, the DAO could build out \u201cmore formal proposal process (i.e, number proposals, clear format for different types of proposal - protocol improvement, governance process change, operating norms, etc.)\u201d Further, the Grants program is planned to vastly improve over the next 18 months and it is critical to ensure governance results reflect the community\u2019s sentiment by making governance engaging and rewarding.   Owocki makes a post characterizing the Sybil Resistance problem as undermining \u201cthe legitimacy of blockchain-based democratic pluralistic processes.\u201d A solution to this problem would be \u201cthe bedrock of Gitcoin Grant\u2019s legitimacy.\u201d Sybil Resistance needs to preserve privacy, exist on a spectrum, and continue evolving with Gitcoin Grants.   Closing the Gap between FDD and Gitcoin Passport Sybil Defenses by Joe Cook lays out the dual strategies Gitcoin uses to minimize the influence of Sybils. The Sybil Account Detection (SAD) model uses a \u201chuman-in-the-loop machine-learning pipeline\u201d to identify and eject accounts. Gitcoin Passport is proactive and lets users \u201cprovide evidence that the user is a real human\u201d such as through Twitter, Google, BrightID, or ENS verification. Both these systems are imperfect and deliver differing results but together they form a composable stack that can be used in creative ways.   Owocki announces that season two of The GreenPill Podcast will focus on Digital Identity and Sybil Resistance! The first episode from the new season features Bryan Ford, who leads the Decentralized/Distributed Systems (DEDIS) lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).     Gitcoin Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.  Active Proposals:  Proposal Discussions:  PGF Budget Request Moonshot Collective Budget Request FDD Budget Request MMM Budget Request DAO Ops Budget Request   Latest Completed Proposals:   Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15  Result: Passed      Workstream Discussion: Season 15 Budgets     Public Goods Funding   Budget Request: $664,550 + 60 Day Reserves: $443,033 - Treasury Balance: $900,000*  Treasury Request: $207,583* This budget covers 12 full-time contributors and 5 part-time contributors. One of our goals for this season is to set up \u201cthe grants program for a transition into a protocol world.\u201d As Grants 2.0 is developed by GPC, we\u2019ll help define the protocol, how funds should flow, and how to determine if a program is within scope. We\u2019ll also keep running our quarterly grants round and improve our policy and process for determining grant eligibility. The grassroots efforts we run will continue to highlight grantees and funders in weekly spaces. Lastly, we\u2019ll aim to increase the amount of sustainable funding for Gitcoin grantees by growing net new S15 matching funds and partners by 25%. Visualize the budget    Moonshot Collective   Budget Request: $415,121 + 60 Day Reserves: $180,000 - Treasury Balance: $346,901*  Treasury Request: $248,220* This covers 8 full-time contributors and 1 part-time contributor. We\u2019ll be running lean with two teams of 1 PM and 2 devs each. We\u2019ll also have 1 dev and 1 designer helping GPC with core protocol work. One of our teams will focus on building on our partnership with Optimism by developing two modules for their use of the Grants 2.0 protocol: one for quadratic voting, and one for MACI (minimal anti-collusion interface). Combined, these modules will allow Optimism to quadratically weigh private on-chain votes. Our other team will be working on identity staking \u2013 creating a new avenue for GTC utility, and building on top of the Passport protocol. In doing so, we\u2019ll create a tight feedback loop with GPC and help prepare the protocol to be built on by communities outside of Gitcoin. Visualize the Budget    Fraud Detection & Defense   Budget Request: $349,500 + 60 Day Reserves: $233,000 - Treasury Balance: $350,000*  Treasury Request: $362,500* This covers 8 core contributors and 5 trusted contributors. We will continue to ensure matching funds are allocated as optimally as possible by operationally executing the fraud detection & defense needs of the grants rounds. Our goals for Grants Eligbility are to have an average time to review less than 48 hrs and an average time to appeal resolution less than 96 hours. We also want to understand the impact of Sybil accounts, mitigate contributor fraud, and estimate fraud tax. We are starting an initiative to empower the community by sharing raw, anonymized data and enabling the crowdsourcing of data insights. In addition, we will be assisting the Gitcoin Product Collective with operational insights, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic/mechanism design research. Visualize the Budget    Merch, Memes & Marketing   Budget Request: $417,543 + 60 Day Reserves: $278,362 - Treasury Balance: $522,970*  Treasury Request: $172,935* This budget is for 4 full-time contributors and 12 part-time contributors In season 15, our focus will be on three key areas: Protocols, Grants Programs, and Community. For Protocols, we will be focusing on discovering and refining product-market fit by conducting customer research, creating content, and working closely with our partners. For Grants programs, we will grow awareness, comprehension, and participation in grants rounds by upgrading our marketing strategy, developing runbooks, and creating templates to share with partners. For Community, we will deepen engagement, improve brand affinity and empower members to champion our vision. We will grow our social media channels and engagement while hosting more events (both IRL and virtual) to expand our community. Visualize the Budget    DAO Operations   Budget Request: $293,146 + 60 Day Reserves: $195,431 - Treasury Balance: $750,000*  Treasury Request: $0* This budget covers 4 full-time contributors and 11 part-time contributors. After season 15 budgeting, we anticipate having $270k USD in surplus to be sent back to the DAO treasury. We have two overarching priorities: rebuilding trust with workstreams by delivering immediately helpful results and building a habit of accountability that focuses on delivery. For community and governance, we will focus on increasing DAO Citizens engagement, creating a clear onboarding process, improving governance documentation, and engaging at least 80% of stewards to vote on all formal proposals. On the People Ops side, we want all core and trusted contributors to receive a quarterly peer review, provide workstreams with compensation recommendations, and assist contributors transitioning from holdings. On our support team, we will try to resolve support tickets within 20 hours on average, and make sure the current state of the Grants program is reflected on our Knowledge Base within 10 business days of changes. Visualize the Budget    Gitcoin Product Collective   Our first seasonal budget request for $983,429 covers 13 full-time contributors and consultants. It was executed on-chain August 3rd as we transitioned from Holdings into the DAO. Visualize the GPC Budget Other Updates:   Round Manager: We deployed our contracts on Optimism and implemented high-fidelity designs. Our latest demo shows our end-to-end application from creating a round to approving an application.  Passport: Our latest blog post explains why identity protocols are so important in web3 and how we\u2019re building the infrastructure for a decentralized, verifiable, identity.  Grants Hub: We finalized our S15 roadmap, mobile designs for project verification, a v1 User Research Report, and are looking to be production ready the week of Sept 5th to 9th. We\u2019re also building out support for connecting multiple wallets, switching networks, and applying to a round.

We also passed an agreement for a $10MM Treasury Diversification from GTC into stablecoins!  See the vote results in our Governance Overview   If you would like to receive a succinct summary of the latest Gitcoin News in your inbox, sign up here!    Hot Topics:   From August 12th to August 19th, 8 new stewards expressed their interest in governing Gitcoin. One of them, shawn16400, is a new DAO Core member. The other 7 are all from Consensys-Mesh. They include two Partners, an Executive Assistant, a Head of Marketing, a Marketing Manager, a Talent Advisor, and a Portfolio Analyst. From 2017 to 2021, Consensys-Mesh incubated Gitcoin then after Gitcoin raised enough funds to spin out, ConsenSys sat on the board of directors. In addition to incubating companies, ConsenSys Mesh runs the Tachyon Accelerator, manages an investment portfolio, and participates in DAO governance.   Kyle, Annika, Lindsey, and Nate shared their voter guides for season 15. All four guides highlight the market conditions forcing leaner workstream budgets and a desire to see improved performance from some struggling workstreams.   Elliott from Llama shares Gitcoin\u2019s July 2022 Financial Report. Gitcoin\u2019s treasury remains over 99% GTC worth over $88MM. This month\u2019s contributor rewards totaled $834.7k up 6.1% from last month. With GPC entering the budget in August, at an anticipated 36.4% of the DAO Budget, the total contributor rewards are expected to increase despite leaner workstreams.   In a lucid post about plural passports, llllvvuu, asks \u201cif I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports?\u201d He then explains that if rewards for adding more credentials to a passport level off, then there is an incentive to hold multiple passports. This could be prevented by credentialing systems, like Worldcoin and BrightID, linking identities across systems to verify that a person does not hold multiple identities.   Owocki makes a post on the Gitcoin Hyperstructure which details three phases of Gitcoin\u2019s coordination evolution. \u201cGitcoin started as socialware\u201d with high social coordination costs and utilizing the primary mechanism of human relationships. Gitcoin is evolving more trustware which use technology to have low social coordination costs. The final form will be a hyperstructure: \u201ca crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries.\u201d   Latest Episodes from the GreenPill Podcast with Kevin Owocki:  One Human, One Node with Humanode Founder Victor Paradigm | Green Pill #38 Reputation-Based Economies with Danny Zuckerman | Green Pill #37 Creating Sybil Resistance with Upala Founder Petr Porobov | Green Pill #36      Gitcoin Governance Overview: Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.   Active Proposals:  Memes, Merch, and Marketing Season 15 Budget Request Disburse Moonshot Collective Budget [Tally]    Proposal Discussions:   Latest Completed Proposals:   Withdraw $10MM of GTC to diversify our treasury and increase governance partners: 82.41% YES  Public Goods Funding S15 Budget Request: 64.5% YES  Fraud Detection and Defense Funding S15 Budget Request: 96.87% YES  Moonshot Collective S15 Budget Request: 99.7% YES  S15 DAO Ops Budget Update: 96.3% YES  GR15 Round Structure: 100% FOR    Workstream Discussion:   Public Goods Funding    Our partners have already committed over $2.6 million in total matching funds for GR15 across the Main Round, 4 Cause Rounds ($900k+ matching pool) & 13 Ecosystem Rounds ($1.3M+ matching pool). More partners continue to sign on every day and we expect this total to keep growing!   We\u2019ve published guidance, in partnership with MMM, for grant creators. Grant creators should submit their new applications or updates by Sept 3rd at midnight CDT to receive a thorough review before the start of the round. The first days of the round are critical for raising the most funds!     Moonshot Collective    We shipped two identity staking stamps that were successfully merged into the Passport codebase. This is a huge step toward Sybil resistance by enabling self-staking and community-staking on an individual\u2019s identity. Now, we\u2019re focused on upgrading our front-end design for the staking app and auditing our smart contracts.   We identified three themes for our workstream to build success processes: cross-stream accountability, initiative accountability, and idea intake/vetting. Our team is developing proposals to address these.     Fraud Detection & Defense    We identified 1,121 likely Sybil Attackers based on their history of grant contributions and usernames. These accounts can be squelched to prevent influencing the matching fund while still accepting their \u201cgenerous\u201d donation    We\u2019re diving deep into how we can open up our data to be maximally useful for Grants 2.0. We\u2019re also exploring how we can host a hackathon post-GR15 for data analysis.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    We\u2019re significantly amping up our Grants Round Marketing for GR15! We completed a runbook and tracker to support our Partners\u2019 Marketing efforts. We also created Twitter and email campaigns and are preparing a lot of content!   We dropped an educational and entertaining Web3 Identity series on our blog. Check them out:  Web 3 Identity 101: Episode 1 Sybil Attacks Web3 Identity 101: Episode 2 DID & VCs Streamlining Sybil Defense for Gitcoin Grants with Gitcoin Passport    One of our top priorities is protocol product marketing. We\u2019re making sure we have descriptive names for each product, building a landing page for Gitcoin Passport, and aligning on a marketing plan for a key partnership.     DAO Operations    People Ops: We developed documentation for converting GTC and are developing guidance on employment benefits through Opolis and WorkDAO. In addition, we are discussing how we can improve the peer review process for contributors based on workstream feedback.   CSDO: In this week\u2019s CSDO meeting, we discussed updates to the passed vote to diversify $3MM of GTC into stablecoin. We have ~$3.8MM in our portfolio currently and CSDO voted to continue diversifying the surplus rather than returning it to the treasury. Additionally, our DAO-wide Tuesday Syncs are increasingly becoming a place for deeper dives and we\u2019re looking to continue/expand this trend. We also discussed updating the gitcoin.co website and how FDD can help ensure that PGF has the data they need in a Grants 2.0 future.     Gitcoin Product Collective    Round Manager: We deployed to a production environment, and demoed the completed bulk approve/reject feature of our project. We also completed an internal design sprint for Grant Explorer and will be gathering user feedback before we build out our MVP.   Grants Hub: As of our latest demo, we are 90% complete with Phase 2 of Grants Hub. Last week, we improved the UX by adding image cropping and developing new designs for payout wallet address validation. This week, we are finalizing the cryptographic security of PII data in our Round Manager integration, and conducting research interviews with new users.
