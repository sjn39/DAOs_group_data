The goal of the Retrospection Process is to surface a process to help prune unused or low-utility MIPs. This process also helps introduce and familiarize the broader community with MIPs that continue to be used. This change makes MIP0 depend on MIP4 for the removal process.   Amended MIPs and Components  Adds some components to MIP0 and amends MIP0c3 The MIP Lifecycle    Amendment Pull Request  PR  ",
