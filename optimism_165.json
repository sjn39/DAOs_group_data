                    "content": "Project Name: Tarot Author Name: @TigrisOfGaul Number of OP tokens requested: 600,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0x63D5554b748598C191aB0cBd0E0e1C638FFEBEe6 I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes Relevant Usage Metrics: Currently on Optimism: ~$3M TVL, achieved with no token incentives Total TVL on all chains: ~$20M TVL with ~$7.5M in borrowing activity Transactions on Optimism: 28,700+ account transactions (e.g. borrow, repay, leverage, deleverage, etc.) via router contracts since launch, as well as ~7,200 vault transactions per week. Grant Category: Phase 1 (Governance Fund) Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee?: This proposal may fall under the remit of various DeFi committees. Optimism alignment and ecosystem value proposition: Tarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers in isolated lending pools. Lenders can supply tokens to earn single-sided passive yield without impermanent loss, while borrowers can leverage their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens supplied by lenders. Since launching in May 2022, Tarot has become one of the top protocols to single stake OP and earn yield on Optimism. Tarot has several OP-based lending pools, with Supply APRs of up to ~34% for single-sided OP lending with no impermanent loss, and leveraged LP APRs (5x) for OP-based pairs exceeding 200-250%. These pools offer long-term OP holders a source of sustainable yields without selling, ultimately driven by the trading fees and DEX rewards earned by LPs. Supply APRs for ETH and stablecoin lending on Tarot regularly exceed 5-10%. Tarot is proud to be part of the OP ecosystem. Beyond the many technical merits of the OP ecosystem for an advanced DeFi protocol like Tarot, we believe the core tenets of Tarot DAO are fully aligned with the Optimistic Vision. Open sourced?: Yes, Tarot is open sourced. Optimism native?: No. Tarot launched on Fantom in June 2021 and on Optimism in May 2022. Date of deployment on Optimism: Tarot has been live on Optimism since May 6, 2022. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No. Tarot has not previously applied for any OP grants. Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No. How much will your project match in co-incentives?: 3,000,000 TAROT has been allocated over a 12-month period towards matching co-incentives, following the adoption of TIP-018: Tarot Co-Incentivization on Optimism. This allocation is flexible, and can be used to incentivize any pair, not just those that are TAROT-based. Furthermore, this allocation is broad in scope, and is not limited to DEX liquidity incentives. One such use of this allocation is via Tarot\u2019s own single-token TAROT farming rewards mechanism, which tracks and rewards borrowing activity in the protocol. OP token incentives for liquidity bribes and other liquidity incentivization mechanisms will be matched with TAROT and/or other token incentives. Additionally, the TAROT-based pools may be co-incentivized by Velodrome and Beethoven X. Proposal for token distribution: OP token incentives will primarily be used to drive liquidity to TAROT-based pairs on Optimism. This includes, for example, the USDC/TAROT pool on Velodrome (co-incentivized by Velodrome) and a TAROT/ETH pool on Beethoven X (currently in discussion to co-incentivize with Beethoven X). How will the OP tokens be distributed? Liquidity providers (90%): 540,000 OP is allocated to liquidity bribes and incentivization mechanisms on Velodrome, Beethoven X, and/or other major DEXs on Optimism to incentivize TAROT-based liquidity (e.g., USDC/TAROT, TAROT/ETH, OP/TAROT). Core team + initial OP-TAROT liquidity (10%): 60,000 OP is allocated to the Tarot core team in support of Tarot\u2019s growth and operations on Optimism. The OP will be paired with team-held TAROT and provided as initial liquidity on Optimism for a period of at least 12 months. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: This is flexible, but OP token incentives for liquidity providers are expected to be distributed over 12-16 months. Initial OP-TAROT liquidity will be held for a period of at least 12 months. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Our early liquidity incentivization program with Velodrome has already yielded strong results with unprecedented capital efficiency. Since launching incentives in August, over 7,000,000 TAROT has been bridged to Optimism and over $560,000 in TAROT-USDC liquidity has been provided on Velodrome. This includes a significant amount of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) bridged over to Optimism following the adoption of TIP-019: Velodrome Liquidity. Milestones will be structured around sustainable liquidity for TAROT-based pairs, including OP-TAROT liquidity, as well as increased borrowing activity in Tarot\u2019s lending pools: If we assume $15,000 in cumulative weekly incentives across all incentivized pools (which includes OP incentives, plus matching co-incentives in the form of TAROT, USDC, and/or other tokens), over a 12-month period, this yields ~$780,000 in total rewards. If we propose a long-term target of 20% to 40% APR for volatile pairs, we would expect ~$2M to ~$3.9M of liquidity depth. Liquidity for all TAROT-based pairs is eminently trackable, and all lending and borrowing activity in Tarot can be tracked and monitored (e.g., via DeFi Llama, Dune Analytics, and within the Tarot UI). How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?: By significantly increasing the available liquidity for TAROT on Optimism, Tarot will have the flexibility to offer a number of direct or targeted incentivization models on Optimism for lending pools. In practice, the increase of borrowing activity in Tarot\u2019s lending pools creates a flywheel effect and, in response to higher pool APRs, lenders are incentivized to supply additional tokens, thus increasing TVL and liquidity across the ecosystem. Liquidity incentivization for the TAROT-based pairs will encourage Tarot stakeholders to provide deep liquidity in the OP ecosystem. This distribution helps Tarot to continue to offer competitive yields, generated by supply and demand for loans in isolated lending pools, to users on Optimism, and will facilitate the creation and expansion of additional lending pools (e.g. USDC/TAROT) with attractive leveraged APRs. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? On Fantom, Tarot lending pools have continued to see strong demand and competitive yields, in the form of single-sided lending, auto-compounding LP, and borrowing and leveraged yield farming, even following the sunsetting of the Tarot Farming Rewards program. Tarot will continue to attract users and liquidity to the OP ecosystem from other chains, and further development of future products and yield opportunities on Optimism will continue, even after the conclusion of OP token incentives.

It\u2019s much more capital efficient to target incentives over time according to liquidity needs, rather than commit to a specific, fixed allocation for particular pairs an entire year ahead of time.  Please mention how many pair you are targeting and how much token will be allocated to which pool.  The current expectation is to incentivize a USDC-TAROT pair on Velodrome and a weighted pool on Beethoven X with OP, TAROT, and possibly also ETH. Crucially, in addition to OP incentives, pools on Optimism will be incentivized with TAROT (and may also be co-incentivized by Velodrome and Beethoven X). Proposals from other projects may explicitly commit to allocations and incentive structures far ahead of time, but I believe this is shortsighted. In reality, the target liquidity amounts and APRs for overall incentivization should be monitored and adjusted regularly to ensure they are most impactful for the Optimism network.  Why do you need token for core team ?  The 10% portion of OP goes towards providing a significant amount of initial liquidity on Optimism for a period of at least 12 months. The other side of that liquidity (TAROT tokens) is provided by the team. This demonstrates committment on both sides and ensures long-term alignment of incentives. ",

My personal suggestion:- Choose two or max 3 pair. TAROT/X TAROT/Y and TAROT/OP distribute reward equally. 33% each. Also, in order to get the incentives, as a user, i will need to buy TAROT hence boosting your project native token which is a big red flag in this proposal but I will support if tarot/op pair is part of this.

Summary of Incorporated Feedback Since the introduction of this proposal in July, the following updates have been incorporated in response to community feedback:   Matching TAROT Co-Incentives: A Tarot DAO governance proposal, TIP-018: Tarot Co-Incentivization on Optimism, was adopted to allocate 3,000,000 TAROT over a 12-month period towards Optimism incentives.   Expanded Distribution: The distribution of OP token incentives for liquidity providers was expanded to include all TAROT-based pairs, over a longer period (12-16 months).   Initial OP-TAROT Liquidity: A portion of the OP incentives (60,000 OP) will be paired with team-held TAROT and provided as initial liquidity on Optimism for a period of at least 12 months.   Optimism Metrics: Usage metrics have been expanded to include transaction counts for Tarot\u2019s router and vault contracts on Optimism.   Updated V2 Template: The proposal has been updated to conform with the updated V2 proposal template. Further details provided include: distribution milestones, an explanation for how Tarot will incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism, and how the development of future products and yield opportunities on Optimism will continue after incentives have concluded.

This user has good suggestion, why not reward for single side LP then the responsibility will on user.     JohnnyF:  People also can just single-sided lend their tokens to any of the pools and will earn a return on that, with zero IL   Co-incentive are case dependent but good to see that you are matching $500K in OP to $140K in Tarot.

We believe that @katie and DeFi committee A rejecting this proposal because it deals with a native token is missing the forest for the trees. It is also puzzling that the same committee supported without reservation Kromatika\u2019s own proposal, which does the same thing\u2014uses both protocol-owned-liquidity and liquidity incentivization of its native token $KROM\u2014with less justification. We will publish our own review of this other proposal shortly.

It is that the committee\u2019s rejection seems to be born a misunderstanding of the nature of Tarot and the role that LP incentives will play in driving protocol activity, even after it has been clarified by @TigrisOfGaul and @jackanorak. Statements like \u201call of tokens are being used to bootstrap Tarot\u2019s own token\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge that doing so is a more capital efficient way to incentivize Tarot usage then direct protocol incentives and \u201cour recommendation is to focus on Optimism pairs\u201d seems like you\u2019ve entirely missed the point of the incentives. Why would a lending and borrowing protocol looking to grow on Optimism ask for a grant to incentivize OP pairs? If this is where you all choose leave things, I see two risks:   Tarot doesn\u2019t have specific and actionable feedback to submit an improved proposal, maybe doesn\u2019t even try   Builders develop a perception that they can\u2019t trust governance to understand or engage with nuanced proposals resulting worse outcomes for the ecosystem   If the committee is going to stick to it\u2019s no recommendation, I would like to see them at the very least demonstrate they understood and remain unpersuaded by the thoughtful clarifications offered below. From Jack:  Tarot, an incentivized leveraged yield protocol, is unlike many projects in that it can (and would) directly incentivize general use selectively with token emissions. Borrow and lend on the protocol, get TAROT in addition to your compounded yield. Because of this, using OP to incentivize liquidity on TAROT is more or less tantamount to directly incentivizing borrowing and lending activity. More liquidity \u2192 more capacity to issue TAROT \u2192 more users of the protocol. In this way, Tarot would have the flexibility to juice certain types of activity it wants to promote without having to redirect OP to farmers looking to dump it. Pairing TAROT with OP isn\u2019t necessary but does offer a marginal liquidity backstop for OP.  From Tigris:  We view the OP incentives program through the lens of efficient capital allocation , and structured our proposal to align the long-term success of Tarot on Optimism with that of the Optimism network. Currently, the direct incentivization of DEX liquidity is 30-50x more capital efficient than incentivizing borrow activity in Tarot. For example, $1 of OP bribes results in $2-3 of DEX rewards almost immediately, compared to $1 of OP borrow incentives resulting in ~$1 of borrow activity over one year. From the protocol\u2019s point-of-view, it makes no sense to bribe non-TAROT pairs on DEXs, as the impact of bribing other pairs does not flow to Tarot directly.  ",
