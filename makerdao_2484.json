                    "content": "Hi all, The recent phenomenon of COMP farming has increased demand for Dai well beyond what we are used to. At the same time, participants have been losing faith in the state of the peg since it began to trade above parity on a sustained basis starting with the March crash. ETH has been on a slight uptrend since then, but demand for CDPs is clearly not enough to match the demand for Dai. The longer this is the state of affairs, the harder it will be to convince market makers to resume and continue making a market for Dai near parity, making the peg issues worse. Backing Dai with CDPs is easy and ideal, however, the impact of Stability Fee is limited by the zero lower bound, and slow to generate demand for CDPs. Lowering the Liquidation Penalty or Collateralization Ratio severely increases the risk of the system. We need to consider additional monetary policy tools which have strong signaling properties, and can quickly relieve pressure on the peg, allowing market forces to resume their normal work. I propose Open Market Operations to aid in restoring the peg. In this framework, MakerDAO creates initially unbacked Dai. This Dai is used to purchase crypto-assets on the open market, which are then added to the DAO\u2019s balance sheet. This allows the DAO to increase the supply of Dai without waiting for external actors, while keeping the system fully collateralized. It also provides another lever to bring Dai back to parity when it is below the peg (by undoing the OMO.) The exact way to implement this technically should be researched, but one possibility is the creation of a CDP type which cannot be liquidated and which can be controlled only by the DAO. The existing auction system can be retrofitted to fund the CDP, in which the DAO draws a certain amount of Dai from the CDP, and puts it up for auction. Market participants compete to provide the highest amount of collateral (e.g. ETH or BAT) in exchange for the Dai. There are other monetary policy tools which should be explored as additional options for controlling the peg, but Open Market Operations are one of the most potent and quickly-responsive tools we can use.

There are a lot of implementation details, one being that the protocol couldn\u2019t just route millions of unbacked Dai through DEXs because the slippage would be astronomical and erode the likelihood of later selling the assets to cover the unbacked Dai position. There would need to be some sort of OTC agreement to purchase the ETH or MKR that would fit into a Spell. And naturally you\u2019d need to move all of this through governance. The Peg Stabilization Module is in my opinion a much better solution for our current state. ",

System Reserves Risk       Reposting this here because this has popped up in relation to @LongForWisdom and the MIPX Proposal regarding DAI Protocol Transfer and discussion with @Andy_McCall  Given that Maker governance seems to have relaxed regarding centralization risks on various coins (wBTC, USDC, and who knows what we add next).  Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to take DAI surplus which one would use as system reserves and general operating funds and convert them into other stablecoin assets:   USDC, PAX, USDT, whatever. \u2026     The point was to have governance MINT unbacked DAI put it into a secondary surplus fund to directly buy assets with DAI (directly injecting DAI into markets and have a bonus effect of backing the printed DAI but ONLY via a secondary surplus that technically is excluded from an ES).   This has two effects.  Allows direct injection AND removal of DAI into and out of the system Dilutes the ES value of DAI which should be reflected in the PEG.  Whether to use collateral that works in vaults and having governance deposit the collateral in the secondary reserve into vaults to assure ES system mechanics are intact entirely can be done or not depending on how much governance wants to effectively dilute DAI.   All of these options -including the PSM means Maker directly interacting with markets so we do need some care. I have made other suggestions: negative interest rates by paying a kind of interest token to DAI borrowers that can be redeemed against interest paid when SF\u2019s are above 0 - or in any other vault with SF > 0 to reduce interest later based on DAI generated today.   There are lots of ways to implement a form of negative rates and we need to have discussion on means to do negative rates that are the least disruptive to implementers of DAI in wallets for various purposes. I also have suggested since we are doing a DSChief rework here to have MKR vaults available in DSChief (with conservative parameters) so MKR itself can participate in open market operations with DAI backed by MKR in governance using vault mechanics.   EIther that or open MKR vaults in the normal sense but have an option for MKR deposited into a vault to also participate in governance.  (either way).   THe point here is that MKR backs the system why not take \u2018some\u2019 advantage of it. These are all proposals that need to be vetted but they all have some validity and levels of applicability even if they have to be conservative.    We need and want every available tool we can apply to PEG management and thereby create an environment for increased system growth. ",

It is certainly more sustainable than doing so at a price of $1.02 which I feel is pretty dangerous. Once liquidation penalties are set to 5% like in the PSM solution I linked to there is no longer a reason to buy Dai above $1.05 or so and as a result Dai should be easy to control at $1.07 if it ever irrationally ended up there to begin with.  With the current 13% liquidation fee Dai can easily reach $1.13 as Vault owners scramble to free collateral before liquidation. as they have the incentive to save themselves the penalty and potential slippage that occurs if liquidated. The model I wrote out uses several different PSMs to control the Dai price and then as a last resort would do what you are suggesting here.  What do you think? As a final maneuver to keep Dai price in check there is always fear of global settlement. ",

For a week after BT the system MKR flops were turned off and we ran a PEG > 1 with a surplus defiict of 5.3M on about 70M outstanding.  which should have dropped the PEG to < .95 but didn\u2019t.   This one fact told me markets were not paying attention to the backing value of MKR and why I still think we can MINT DAI out of thin air to both dilute the ES backing value of DAI to help resore PEG and use the DAI for various types of open market operations. . The real question is whether we can set MKR flops so that they don\u2019t happen unless the surplus is BELOW zero vs. at 0.    This would allow the system to inflate DAI until market peg comes back into line and we can sop up the negative amount in the surplus with SF.    Everyone seems to want to have their cake and eat it too.   Rather than allow the system to run with backing off 1:1 by running with a negative surplus and taking the minted DAI to a secondary reserve facility to sell for other assets we would rather manhandle markets via the PSM. Honestly have to ask what is better or worse here in terms of providing liquidity.  Extend system DC\u2019s and lower SF\u2019s where we can to add liquidity. A form of negative rates. Negative surplus decreasing the 1:1 collateral backing in the system. Secondary reserve used for direct injection of DAI into and out of markets PSM Adding MKR as a vault type.  ",
