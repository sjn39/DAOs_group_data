All passed with two exceptions:   MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure.  MIP40c3-SP63: COM-001 expanded budget. (MIP40c3-SP62 passed instead).  We\u2019ve added a new column (Impact Estimation) to the by now traditional table below; we\u2019ve also chosen to use the more compressed way of displaying the vote breakdown (where green is yes, orange is no, and gray is abstain). Alright, without further ado\u2026:     Proposal Impact Estimation Vote Breakdown       MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure \u201cPairwyse is an active protocol and blueprint for creating bespoke fixed-rate DAI lending and investment Agreements on MakerDAO between borrowers and lenders. We wish to thank the Maker Community for its previous feedback concerning the negative impact of patents on open source projects and potential concentration risks posed by fixed-rate innovations currently incubating in the Maker ecosystem. In posting this MIP, we wish to directly address these shared concerns with a fresh proposal we feel is favorable for MakerDAO, its contributors, its users and all current and future DeFi innovators throughout the collective ecosystem.\u201d  High  Voting Portal      MIP67: Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions\"MIP67 intends to (1) formally approve the Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions 17 published by the Real-World Finance Core Unit, and (2) introduce a high-level process that each MIP6-compliant application should undergo in order to receive, eventually, a positive endorsement from the relevant real-world CU stakeholder groups\u2014e.g., RWF-001, SES-incubated Lending Oversight team, future CUs.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      MIP6c3-SP2: Modify the Collateral Application Form\"The goal is to amend the collateral application template to contain relevant questions that allow Core Units and the MakerDAO community to more easily make an informed opinion on whether or not a collateral type is fit to be greenlit to be onboarded into the Maker Protocol.\"  Medium  Go to Voting Portal      MIP7c3-SP7, MIP4c2-SP18: Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team\"MIP7c3-SP7 and MIP4c2-SP18 (a MIP7 amendment) add CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team.\"  Medium  Go to Voting Portal      MIP47c3-SP1: Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request\"Now that the Content Production Core Unit has been offboarded, their wallet should be removed from the recognized multi-sig list. Currently, no funds are available in the multi-sig, but it can still claim ~3.8k DAI from their canceled budget stream.\"  Low  Go to Voting Portal      MIP39c2-SP30: Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001, Mandate Refresh\"MIP39c2-SP30 updates the mandate for Core Unit COM-001. The Governance Communications Core Unit performs a set of programs that focus on MakerDAO\u2019s informational accessibility, stakeholder coordination, and communication practices as a decentralized and public organization.\"  Medium  Go to Voting Portal      MIP39c2-SP31: Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate\"This subproposal modifies the Data Insights Core Unit (\u201cDIN\u201d) mandate previously ratified with MIP39c2-SP22. It\u2019s mostly about simplification of the previous document and stressing of our focus on L2 and cross-chain data as well as RWA datasets.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      MIP40c3-SP62: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001\"This modification adjusts the team\u2019s budget figures, extends our funding through to the end of 12/22, and updates the budget implementation.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      MIP40c3-SP63: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001\"This modification adjusts the team\u2019s budget figures, extends our funding through to the end of 12/22, and updates the budget implementation.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      MIP40c3-SP64: Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget\"MIP40c3-SP64 adds the budget for Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001) to account for the new mandate that expands on the initial mission to maintain the existing data assets and build new datasets to cover L2s, RWAs, and puts a special focus on the community.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      MIP40c3-SP68: Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001\"Protocol Engineering would like to secure an operating budget for it to deliver its mandate over the next 12 months.The prior year\u2019s budget in review gave a good illustration as to where Protocol Engineering under- or over-budgeted for the work we sought to accomplish, which has subsequently helped inform this document.The following proposal is also in support of the forum post: Protocol Engineering Core Unit Workstreams. Our team stands behind this proposal as an optimal solution for scaling the Core Unit in a dynamic environment. We encourage readers to review that post in conjunction with the below budget request.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)\"The Events Core Unit will handle planning, organization, and execution of MakerDAO branded events. Our vision is to use an exhaustive list of themes, visuals, set dressing, technology and branding to carry out events to the highest standards for the MakerDAO community.\"  High  Go to Voting Portal      776\u00d7460 225 KB   Proposals in RFC     \u2014 RFC and FS Dates for reference and for existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  All the proposals currently in RFC are eligible to enter the May Governance Cycle. There are no weekly-cycle proposals at the moment.     Proposal Author Earliest Possible Entry Governance Cycle      MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution\"The MIP intends to 1) set up a starting Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the Maker USDC funds; 2) select a professional fund manager for the execution of the above strategy; 3) set up a Maker Execution and Governance Operating platform necessary for implementation; 4)implement and Deploy USDC [TBD]; 5) devise a staged plan for further deployment.\"  @Allan_Pedersen May    MIP68: Monetalis Vault V2\"MIP68 is a self-contained collateral onboarding MIP that will onboard and activate a RWA vault backed by the assets of a trust arranged by Monetalis.\"  @Allan_Pedersen May    MIP69: L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals\"Teleporting DAI from L2 to L1 is known as a \u201cFast Withdrawal\u201d. To complete a fast withdrawal, DAI is burnt on L2, minted on L1, and sent to the user as soon as the L2 transaction is confirmed. This MIP focuses on the above L2 to L1 transaction. L2 to L2 transactions will be defined in a future MIP when the full wormhole functionality is ready to be launched.\"  Protocol Engineering (PE-001) May    MIP4c2-SP19: MIP40 Budget Process Amendment Subproposal\"For the DAO to grow long-term, it is critical that MKR holders be able to evaluate and compare Budget Proposals with minimum cognitive overhead. Within this revised MIP, Core Units and proposed Core Units are required to submit standardized, transparent and clear financial information. Budget Proposals must clearly serve a revenue-driving or supporting business purpose in line with the Objectives of the DAO.\"   @Aes, @adcv, @SebVentures  May    MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments\"Recent events have shown the process for involuntarily offboarding facilitators and core units could be improved. These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.\"   @gfxlabs, with @twblack88 currently running point on it May - This proposal will most likely be submitted on June\u2019s cycle.

In case you\u2019re wondering, MIP70: Huntingdon Valley Bank Self-Contained Onboarding Strategy & Execution and MIP71: Huntingdon Valley Bank \u201cCollateral Block\u201d Exemption are exceptional and are unlikely to ever be formally submitted. See this forum post by the author.  Things to Come    The May Formal Submission Window opens on Monday 2 and closes on Wednesday 4.
