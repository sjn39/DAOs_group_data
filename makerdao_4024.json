As a personal user of flash loans this comes down to who has the cheapest solution to use as well as cost / benefit of having to change the code to a new source. Currently dYdX has the cheapest flash loans at 0%. Previously I thought there may be an argument for paying our fees because we can guarantee liquidity is always available, but since the original poll dYdX has improved its liquidity from 138k to ~10M+. This is large enough now to cover most use cases. I suggest we consider removing the fee and do so permanently. As there seems to be no integrations so far we can benefit from removing the logic for the fee altogether if we never plan to use it again and re-deploy. Flash loans are highly gas-sensitive products and so we want to squeeze out as much as possible.  Pros  Better arbitrage for DAI Better UX for front-ends, can lever up in one go instead of looping, re-financing, etc   Cons  Potential loss of revenue     Should we remove the Flash Mint Module fee?  Yes, remove the fee permanently (requires redeploy, new contract address, saves gas) Yes, set the fee to 0% (can be raised again later) No, leave the fee as-is Abstain     0 voters     Poll will run until Wednesday, August 25th. If successful an on-chain vote will be held to confirm the change followed by an executive with the change. ",

Not to mention that providing liquid Dai on demand can help arb price discrepancies across markets to smooth out market price and generally increase Dai usage in the ecosystem. If we\u2019re wrong and we do need to charge fees later, we can always de-auth a new mint module and re-auth the old one, so permanent doesn\u2019t necessarily mean permanent. ",

My point is that I don\u2019t see any data making a business case here, much less one that should be done at 0 cost. Show me some data regarding flash loan use that gives us a handle on why it is important to spend time on it and I will change my view.   I can\u2019t count the times someone has told me, \u201cwe need this\u201d, and when it was all done we found that no-one used it, because there was no use case.   Just because something sounds great doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it.   Show me some or any data regarding what flash loan arbitrage is doing, how much they are making, and where they are sourcing what and I am happy to change my view. I mean if the argument is - its already done - and just because we can - and people are using it - and it doesn\u2019t reduce system security.   I mean if this is a way to get business going so later we can and would raise fees to be competitive in a space just starting off that is cheap to do, maybe I can buy that.

If this is a cheap, easy and no implications for security (we have this done) way to basically pull developers that is one thing easy to measure.  If it is to enable more arbitrage that is another (that to me requires some data to back up). I just want to have some clarity regarding the goal, and then the overall cost.   I also like things to have this - and later if markets warrant we can easily increase fees.   Which brings me to a question.  If we do this change can we have a on chain fee variable so we can later (if usage warrants this) manage the fee like we do other system parameters.    I think it is the latter point that would make me a bit more excited to do this as it would then have the potential to generate system revenue\u2026 I really would like to see some analysis of what the flash loan arbitragers are doing and how much they are making\u2026   But if this is a get foot in game with devs, this alone can get me to change to a yes as long as there is a provision for easy fee control via governance in this for later.
