It is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track. https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, \u201cself-sovereign\u201d digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs resolve to DID Documents \u2014 simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID. Each DID Document contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints.  \u2026  This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key management\u2014the standard pattern in hierarchical PKI (public key infrastructure). Because DIDs reside on a distributed ledger, each entity may serve as its own root authority\u2014an architecture referred to as DPKI (decentralized PKI).  ",
