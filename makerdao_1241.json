                    "content": " Decentralized Voter Committees I think most of us are probably hurting over the massive crash of crypto prices and the financial damage it is causing. But we must take control of that energy and direct it towards evolving Maker with actions that can fix our flaws and improve growth, income and resilience. This week of voter committee zoom calls will be very important to attend, as things are starting to get real and I will. Both weekly calls will from now on move to 9pm CEST, and continue weekly at this time.  Wednesday 9pm CEST - Join Link  The Wednesday 9 pm CEST call will, as usual for Wednesday calls, focus on the short term task of establishing the voter committee format as the one-stop shop of active MKR holder interaction with the maker governance process, by leading through example and creating precedents that will incentivize the decentralized workforce to properly follow the will of MKR holders. Wednesday this week I will present a plan on how to change the current priorities of the core units through MKR voting, redirecting them towards the list of Focus Objectives I have been publishing for the last few months. We will also once again discuss the list of Focus Objectives, including what to add, remove or rearrange. Since I am now pushing for their immediate enforcement there may be greater engagement than in the past and we may have an opportunity for a healthy discussion about how to prioritize. We must also begin the process of reducing budgets for certain core units, in order to rein in spending as we are headed into an uncertain period and a bear market of unknown length. The goal is also to serve as an important example of how MKR voter signaling can influence governance and set the precedent that public voter committee calls is the primary place where high level decision making occurs. A reminder: the focus of the wednesday call will not be on implementation of the endgame plan. The Wednesday DVC calls will not assume the endgame plan is going to pass. It will be about making changes and optimizations that are relevant no matter what the long term vision is, including fixing budgets and prioritizations and keep scope creep and power creep in check. This is congruent with the endgame plan, since its first step is to define the core of maker and remove anything that detracts from it - but taking such action will be useful whether or not the rest of the endgame plan is implemented.  Thursday 9pm CEST - Join Link  Thursday this week I will present part 4 of the endgame plan: Understanding MetaDAOs, which is a deep dive on metadaos that highlights their key, \u201cbaked-in\u201d synergies with maker, and provides a lot of examples of hypothetical metaDAOs. The baked in maker synergies includes the 3 classes of metaDAOs: Creator, Governor and Reformer, and the 3 MetaDAO core products: MetaDAO Lending Engine (D3M powered), Decentralized Vault Frontend (stability fee revenue share) and Decentralized Workforce Results Guarantee (budget overhead fee) The MetaDAO examples will focus both on the metaverse and meme warfare aspect of MetaDAOs with highly hypothetical examples of what MetaDAOs could look like in the long run (although in practice they will likely still look quite different as it cannot be predicted). This includes examples like DogeDAO The other group of examples will be practical attempts at early stage \u201cclustering\u201d, meaning identifying opportunities where products, resources and counterparties have potential for synergy if connected to a MetaDAO. This includes in particular M0, the \u201clow risk high reward\u201d metaDAO that will attempt to validate the Endgame Plan and MetaDAO paradigm, as well as other metadaos concepts that focus on ecosystem collaboration and partnerships such as with aave and polygon or optimism and the synthetix ecosystem. I will reach out to relevant core units in advance and ask them to make sure they are represented on the calls.  Wednesday Call Link Thursday Call Link   Recordings      ",

I have been presenting the Endgame plan transparently and openly for months, getting a lot of feedback and making many significant changes based on that feedback. It is an incredibly powerful and ambitious plan that, if executed, will take Maker to a new standard of decentralization, resilience, above-board governance and viral growth. I have held voter committees for several weeks now to begin the process of formally organizing governance to occur in public, and as I explained last week, there is currently no major competing proposal with publicly committed MKR backing it, which is why it\u2019s time for me to take action. You can\u2019t simply wish for things to be decentralized and functional - building a DAO unfortunately isn\u2019t that easy. It has to be carefully engineered into existence, and this is incredibly hard work. Most people would probably consider it impossible knowing all the pitfalls, risks and challenges, and I\u2019m one of the few people that both believe it to be possible without having to compromise on decentralization and am speaking from enough experience to not just be falling victim to the dunning kruger effect. If you disagree with my general direction and the potential of the Endgame Plan and MetaDAOs - then you should organize against it by trying to develop your own competing direction and set of proposals. Or simply organize to support the status quo. Just please do it in public as soon as you start to involve core units or paid delegates - the only type of governance action that is unambiguously harmful is hidden power brokering with the decentralized workforce, as it is the antithesis of accessible and transparent governance and creates harmful conflict of interest. If you want to collaborate and improve the Endgame Plan even further, then at this point it should be clear that I\u2019m highly receptive of constructive criticism and feedback, and as mentioned above many features of the plan are the result of iterative feedback during the early stages of the calls.

That was probably 10 thousand dai in labor expenses sucked into that meeting, which could have just been a long memo. I think I speak for everyone that it was downright embarrassing how you talked over people and demanded kow towing. Just take a CEO title or appoint specific representatives for your interests and be done with it. It was incredibly uncomfortable listening to the delegates forced to suck up to you and the facilitators you asked to be there and then not let them say their piece in a detailed way. I hope you watch the recording in case you don\u2019t realize how cringe a lot of that was. I\u2019ll skip the rest of these. Good luck and all that Edited to add: Really glad I wrote this because a lot of DMs are thanking me.

You chose to join it out of your own free will, if you hated it so much you should have just left?  appoint specific representatives for your interests  If this is what you want me to do then I don\u2019t understand why you are so unhappy with the meeting, since that is in general the point of the DVCs, but particularly today I think I made it clear how exactly that can be done in practice, by attending and delegating towards clearly defined DVC parties. We need Maker Governance to serve the interest of MKR holders, and for that to happen voters need to make it very clear what exactly they want (complaining vaguely isn\u2019t enough), and what they are going to do for that to happen (e.g. delegation). It\u2019s a process of publicly organizing and formalizing the different points of view, so that delegates can understand, follow and extrapolate from these views, in order to make governance actually operate in the interest of MKR holders, rather than just be a self-referential bureaucracy.

Being a DAO creates quite a bit of regulatory and legal risk, while also making things like the real world assets staff lift a boulder with both hands tied behind their back due to no legal structure. If you\u2019re just going to be a dictator with your 80000 tokens, why not drop the DAO charade before some government comes after us? The frustration isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t have a right to push your own agenda. It\u2019s that you do it while also handicapping the organization\u2019s ability to operate and massive legal exposure. Perhaps you should just reincorporate Maker if you don\u2019t want it to be decentralized. It would probably run better. But you\u2019re making recorded calls saying you\u2019re going to ram through your own agenda, which will certainly be used as evidence of fake decentralization. Is this a decentralized, inefficient, frustrating, lightly regulated DAO? Or is this a corporate structure responsible for all the traditional taxes and liability and compliance under the founder? It really can\u2019t be both ",

However pretending that 8% of the circulating supply somehow implies dictatorship is completely mistaken. There is absolutely nothing preventing multiple large token holders, or a larger group of small token holders, from organizing to push some different direction, if they wanted to. I have repeatedly been encouraging this for months, and I have telegraphed my own actions the entire time. At this point inaction means consent. And if my assumption of consent turns out to not be the case, great! Mission accomplished, we will see more active voting as MKR holders organize to oppose me and the fledgling Endgame Party. If that doesn\u2019t happen, then that\u2019s also great. I will deliver to all of you, for free, a powerful plan that condenses my experiences from working on maker for the past 7 years, that I have been spending more than a year researching and preparing, and that will quickly result in total and irreversible decentralization of maker governance, solve voter apathy, enforce separation of powers, prevent scope creep and supercharge the project with viral growth. And then I will never have to engage in hands on governance drama ever again. Literally all I ever wanted was to simply be able to sit back, delegate my MKR, and count on the DAO to run itself sustainably. This is my final attempt at trying to get us there. ",

Put them in delegate contracts that you can\u2019t pull from for 6 months. Maybe some delegates are people, some are teams, some are their own DAOs that vote on how their contract votes. I dunno. But spread it around to people you think aren\u2019t going to burn the house down, and then tie your hands so you can\u2019t remove it for a fixed term. Budget: Get rid of Events CU. Don\u2019t need parties. Get rid of Immunefi CU. Just pay the bug bounty program and ditch the $10k/month personnel cost. Get rid of Strategic Happiness CU. Find a part time job for Burban in Growth and let him hand out his swag. Get rid of Deco CU. The terms are bad, it\u2019s a company with its own product. Fund it to get equity or give a grant, but the budget + revenue share is abusive. If it\u2019s important, fund it smartly. Get rid of GovComms. Merge it with GovAlpha, who can help them focus on their job and stop struggling with the operational problems. Bonds: Do what you\u2019re planning already. Publicly traded debt is already professionally underwritten, and has higher yields than what we\u2019re getting on crypto assets. This is the way. Real world assets: Do what you\u2019re planning already. Focus on finishing what we started, and stop bringing in exotic things we can\u2019t manage well. This is the way. Burn/Paying MKR Holders: Do the burn. Do it slow. Do it constantly. Turn it off if profits are less than 5% of market cap. Growing revenues: Bonds, get L2 done, find cheaper oracles that are fine for mid cap tokens with small debt ceiling Like, most of this is just making unpopular decisions and breaking the logjam, which is what you want to do. The problem arises from you wanting to wave a giant flag to every regulator and tax agency in the world that this is not even pretending to be decentralized. ",

But ultimately we need to also address the hardest question of all, which is the core problem of governance alongside these more immediate fixes, or we will just run into another list of fixes that need to be dealt with in the future. Finally I want to make the comment that regulators really dgaf about what you pretend, they only look at the reality of the situation. I don\u2019t agree that the status quo, or any action I can take based on the status quo, is centralized (will explain below why that\u2019s the same thing). Voting is easily available and I don\u2019t have even close to a majority of circulating supply. If I did something other voters disagreed with and wanted to stop, they would simply do so. On top of that ESM is available so profitable, extractive governance attacks are impossible regardless of how much voting power gets concentrated etc. But even if it was centralized, we would be better off in the eyes of a regulator if we are showing concrete steps to deal with it, vs head in the sand decentralization theater, because again they truly don\u2019t care about that, they might even consider it dishonest. Which again, I don\u2019t believe is currently the case, but if you argue that any steps I can take as a voter are \u201ccentralized\u201d then that is equivalent to saying the status quo is centralized. If you have a decentralized state and a single actor can then \u201cun-decentralize\u201d it, then it isn\u2019t decentralized in the first place. ",

                    "content": "I feel this criticism isn\u2019t justified. @rune is presenting an ambitious plan with a lot of details. That takes some time to communicate. Also, apart from @MakerMan and @PaperImperium very few have ever posted well-thought-through proposals of where Maker should go, and it\u2019s in urgent need of direction. Rune managed to galvanize large parts of the active community through a combination of massive MKR holdings, his status as a co-founder and his personality. Yes, that might be \u201cunfair\u201d advantages and give his proposal more limelight than those of other players, but such is the nature of human affairs. Power laws are everywhere. From my perspective as a rather new, and very small delegate (The only person delegating to Flipside is my personal account, at the moment) I applaud the MetaDAO idea, because it would allow me to concentrate on issues and actually build up the in-depth knowledge there to make really good decisions. This can never happen in MakerDAO as a whole, because I can\u2019t ever become good at deciding about RWA vaults, Risk parameters, Governance structures, D3M parameters, PSM mechanics, Crypto collateral and more\u2026 It just can\u2019t be done. But I have to vote on everything, or get penalized. This leads to sub-optimal information and sub-optimal decisions. I have yet to see another plan that preservers much of the incredible talent we have working on Maker and allows a much easier to grasp, well-defined structure. Some argue that the complexity rises, but I actually don\u2019t see it that way. MetaDAOs can try and fail safely, while the core business just gets meaner and leaner. This is the way. It also makes the whole ship much easier to understand. Interested in RWA: work on that MetaDAO. Want to set risk parameters: Lurk in Core Forums. Etc\u2026 Delegates should ideally not have to deal with everything, but develop strong specializations, and integrate with other specialized delegates in \u201cparties\u201d like the Hawks and Doves in Rune\u2019s presentation. I disagree with incentivizing voter participation. The catalog of possible failure modes is exhaustive: sibyll attacks if we introduce caps, financialization and profit-seeking if we don\u2019t, bribing economies if we introduce voted escrow models, prisoner\u2019s dilemma, likelihood of ever-increasing incentives because these proposals will be most voted on, etc\u2026 Voter apathy is a fact. It\u2019s a fact in modern democracies, whose decisions affect everyone in their daily lives. It\u2019s even more of a fact for DeFi protocols where token holders simply want to sit back, dgaf and rake in earnings. One possibility to address that is to introduce a second governance token that you can earn through actively using Maker products, and participating in governance, for instance. Something along the lines of how gaming guilds decorate their top members. @MakerMan has a wonderful proposal on his delegate platform that would allow DAI LP holders governing rights. Awesome! MakerMan delegate platform - Governance / Delegates - The Maker Forum (makerdao.com) These holders use DAI actively and are knowledgable, informed customers. Anyway, I\u2019m happy for this discussion. Maker is the #1 DAO. All other DAOs will have similar problems in a couple of years, while Maker will remain lightyears ahead. Onwards. ",
