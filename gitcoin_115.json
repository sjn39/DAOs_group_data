I can really feel a shift in momentum in the last 2 weeks.  I have been very impressed to see that momentum around Grants 2.0 has been picking up over the last few weeks. What I\u2019ve observed: 0. @lthrift and @kevin.olsen have been doing a Grants 2.0 roadshow - showing off the strategy and architecture.  Weekly demos of the round manager, grant hub, and dpopp for the last 2 weeks.  (here is the latest)  Grants 2.0 is being proposed as major part of the daos essential intent for the next 12-18 months I\u2019ve seen many workstreams re-orienting their roadmaps around Grants 2.0.  I wanted to start this thread to ask the question:  What would have to be true for the DAO to really begin to see momentum around Grants 2.0? What would have to be true for the DAO to build momentum around Grants 2.0? What would have to be true for the DAO to create great software => become a market leader => get to sustainability (and beyond it, to thriving) => handsomely reward its constituents => repeat (the virtuous cycle I personally think the DAO should be aiming)?

What would have to be true for the DAO to build momentum around Grants 2.0?   I would suggest that people set aside time to watch the weekly demos + provide comments on them  on a weekly basis.  No better way to understand the progress than to watch the demos (or, when available, dogfood yourself).  And the builders could use the positive feedback on their builds! ",
