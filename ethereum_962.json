My name is Paul Bouchon and I recently joined the MetaMask team.  MetaMask and most other tools that provide access to web3-enabled environments do so automatically and without user consent. This exposes users of such environments to fingerprinting attacks since untrusted websites can check for a web3 object and reliably identify web3-enabled clients.  This proposal outlines a new dapp initialization strategy in which websites request access to the web3 API instead of relying on its\u2026     Sorry for not seeing this first, it would have been a good place for outlining the constraints in public before sharing a proposal, please add any constraints there that (any reader here) feels we\u2019ve missed.
