                    "content": "As one of the loyal Maker user. I thought to start a discussion around DAI stability. This post might not provide a perfect end solution but I hope it could lead to a better solution with the community discussion. DAI has been out of his peg by more than 1% (currently at $1.02) for quite some time now. Although, many say recent DAI stability has been because of yield farming which might possibly be true and even if it\u2019s true then it\u2019s only going to get more unstable in near future with CRV & AAVE farming in the line. The solution should be aligned towards increase of DAI supply in DEXes, not on borrow & lending platforms. My thoughts on a few solutions:-   Go short on DAI using USDC-A vault (already available for users to take benefit): Users can do up to 10-14x short and can also earn more than 60% on their assets when DAI gets to $1, this can also result in better returns than yield farming. Here\u2019s the basic calculation with the current price 1 DAI = 1.02 USDC. Initial Position: Starting with 10k USDC After 12x (120 DAI debt) - swapping 120k DAI for 122.4k USDC. Final Position: 132.4k USDC & 120k DAI debt. The ratio at 110.33%. 24% ($2,4k returns on $10k) returns when DAI gets to $1.   MKR farming on Curve pool for the sole purpose to increase DAI supply in the market: The sole purpose of the MKR token is to maintain DAI peg. Supply DAI in Curve via wrapper contract and farm MKR & CRV tokens. Once DAI supply will increase on one Curve pool, DAI on all the other DEXes will stabilise themselves due to arbitrage advantage. Maker governance can vote on minting new MKR supply which will be used for farming and burn these MKR tokens by buying them from the market with the protocol fees in future.   Add MKR as new vault type in Maker protocol (don\u2019t know If this could result in any system-level risk): Who\u2019s more incentivized to make DAI stable than the MKR token holders itself. Simple recipe: Deposit MKR \u2192 borrow DAI \u2192 supply in Curve.   Note:- you can supply single stable coin too in the curve and if a user supply tokens whose ratio is less in the pool gets extra curve pool token for making pool stable. Out of all this, my personal favourite is going short on DAI using USDC vault as I personally have been using it for quite some time. ",
