                    "content": " Authors Dave White, Kevin Owocki  Summary This paper introduces Gitcoin Aqueduct, a tool that incentivizes ecosystem development for your project with a single line of Solidity. Aqueduct helps unbundle the work of protocol creation from the work of supporting an ecosystem, and helps protocols grow in a truly decentralized way. To fill your Aqueduct, you transfer in some of your project\u2019s revenue or inflation. In the beginning, your Aqueduct will distribute these tokens to developers on your ecosystem automatically, creating and running quadratic funding rounds with no human intervention. As your project grows and more assets flow into its Aqueduct, GitcoinDAO will begin to provide more and more high-touch ecosystem development services.  Narrative  Problem Alice is developing a new NFT project, NFTP. She is a talented coder and artist and believes in what she is making. Alice also knows that if her project is to be successful long-term, it will need an ecosystem, with other developers contributing, a team managing the Discord, and so on. However, Alice is a builder, not a manager. She is also committed to decentralization. As a result, she doesn\u2019t want to personally coordinate an ecosystem long-term, and she doesn\u2019t want to set up an organization or hire somebody to do it for her.  Solution By design, NFTP receives ongoing revenue from secondary sales of its NFTs. Alice redirects 10% of this revenue to NFTP\u2019s Aqueduct. If NFTP were intended as a pure public good, it might send 100% of revenue to its Aqueduct.  Result After a sufficient amount of tokens accrue in the Aqueduct, Gitcoin automatically holds a quadratic funding round for NFTP using those tokens: developers propose projects that will benefit the NFTP ecosystem, and members of the NFTP community allocate the Aqueduct\u2019s funds to those projects using the quadratic funding mechanism. GitcoinDAO supports this process both by providing the infrastructure for funding and by promoting the round on Twitter and other channels (including, perhaps, a list of Discords to which a GitcoinDAO bot has been invited). Critically, none of this requires any significant expense or human time. Furthermore, it requires no further interaction from Alice or NFTP, which doesn\u2019t even need to have governance. As NFTP grows, aided by Aqueduct-funded development, the amount of revenue allocated to the Aqueduct will grow as well, eventually reaching a point where human involvement is both prudent and economical. Accordingly, at certain pre-defined revenue tiers, the level of service provided by GitcoinDAO will increase. For example, a $100K Aqueduct might come with automated human-in-the-loop anti-fraud support, while a $1M Aqueduct might come with a part-time community manager, and a $10M Aqueduct might come with a full-time ecosystem management team. GitcoinDAO would be compensated with a percentage fee for providing these services.  Mechanism Notes  Side Round Protection The main challenge with this design is how to ensure that funds in the NFTP side-round are actually spent on NFTP ecosystem projects. At sufficient levels of Aqueduct funding, a fee to GitcoinDAO could easily pay for humans to help ensure grants are appropriate. For smaller rounds, or even to ensure alignment in larger rounds, specific protection mechanisms might help. For example, in order to match a donation of 1 ETH, Aqueduct might require the donor to stake at least 5 ETH worth of NFTP NFTs for some time period. Or, it might require the person posting a new grant to post a bond that can be slashed if they are found to have submitted a project that isn\u2019t for the benefit of NFTP, with the bond amount sufficient to incentivize both reporting and adjudication.  Alternatives to Quadratic Funding Today, quadratic funding is the leading system for permissionless ecosystem development. Over time, other methods like Retroactive Public Goods Funding might prove to be more effective. Any such method can easily integrate with Aqueduct.  Conclusion Gitcoin Aqueduct unbundles the work of designing and implementing a protocol from the work of scaling it and managing its community. By doing so, it reduces the friction involved with starting a protocol while providing opportunities for developers to make a living contributing to open source. This is only a rough design sketch, and there are likely many problems to be solved before it can become a reality. We\u2019re excited to hear your feedback and work on improving it together.

I can imagine Public Goods projects using some sort of funding curve where as the amount of proceeds they generate increase, the amount going to Aqueduct increases too.

If the project has received more than 1 million then maybe 50% flow into the aqueduct. If the project has received more than 10 million then 90%+ should flow into the aqueduct. ",

Already seeing a possible improvement :     paradave:  bond that can be slashed   This would make sense only if bonds can be community sponsored. Indeed if all proposals must have bond then we run into a problem where proposers without any \u201ccash\u201d cant add value to the projects and we might end up money gating contribution. A potential solutions would be to have proposers submit the proposal \u201coff chain\u201d and anyone from the community could stake on their behalf to support the aforementionned proposal, once the staking thresehold is met, the proposal becomes on-chain code and enter the aqueduct voting system. We can call this the Dropshafts, those are safety mechanism in aqueduct architecture. Happy to hear feedback on this to make the aqueduct even more efficient. ",

The positive case is that this would be a good separation between protocol building and the Aqueduct funding spawned off projects themselves in the community that eventually become public goods. In the example for the NFTP ecosystem, what are the guidelines for the proposals that developers give? I can see in the case of a protocol, there can be projects that spawn off of it, but if it\u2019s already a set NFT project, are Aqueduct funds used to develop a community, or develop additional projects on top of NFTP? Is this distinction even important? ",
