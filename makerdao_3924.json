However, I\u2019m unable to do so due to Dust limit it seems. I\u2019m getting an error saying  The Maker Vault debt amount either must be 0 or exceed 10,000.00 amount of Dai. Please change your payback amount  To my understanding I should satisfy that 0 requirement. Will appreciate any tips on how to work around this.

Thanks to this report we will reconsider the UI here and provide an update to make it more clear for users that the funds aren\u2019t enough to fully repay their debt. Thanks for the feedback  ",
