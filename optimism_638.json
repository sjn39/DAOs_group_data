If we look at Optimisim as a City we want it to become denser, more poppin, we want our friends to be here, we want the cool stores to be here, we want great nightlife etc. While we want the city to be poppin, we want to maintain the quality of life - this could be largely solved thru public goods funding. Mainly, I\u2019m curious about how opinionated the Optimism collective wants to be about incentivizing specific behavior. If the collective feels it\u2019s fine to subsidize certain protocols, I would suggest  Incentivizing L2 bridge (f.e. Hop) liquidity to allow citizens to easily get to and from Optimism Incentivizing DEX liquidity & usage (f.e. Uniswap) so the network effects become strong enough to overtake mainnet Incentivizing efficient asset allocation f.e. using Lending protocols - people focus on TVL, but more important is that assets are productive Incentivizing deployment of contracts that are used - this could be a catch-all for the whole economy, specifically rewarding smaller projects and NFTs and tokens. But obviously easily gameable  Just a few ideas  ",

Would significantly reduce the amount of noise in Discord where users are asking us to double check if the algorithm ran correctly (it did). Avoid vague category names like \u201cOptimism User\u201d or \u201cRepeat Optimism User\u201d. We\u2019re not actually rewarding Optimism users in general, we\u2019re rewarding a sub-class of Optimism users that fit a given behavior (necessary because we have to filter out spam somehow). Using a generic category name like \u201cOptimism User\u201d creates a sense of unfairness for people who were users of Optimism but didn\u2019t hit the minimum usage requirements to get the bucket. Look into ZK attestations for users that own multiple wallets to prove that they do, in fact, own multiple wallets and can therefore get the bonus for those wallets together. Unfortunately there are some clear problems with this approach, unrelated parties could come together to pretend to share the same wallets to get the bonus, effectively giving people more tokens than they should fairly receive.

Every airdrop eligibility criteria I have seen in this space can be gamed, but addresses in this set must have committed a non-trivial amount of capital until the merge, must be confident in the Ethereum communities\u2019 ability to execute its roadmap and be positioned for long term success. must provide physical infrastructure or pay for it to keep the validator active on the Network, this must be persistent which incurs electricity costs, hardware costs, internet provider costs and time/effort for maintenance. I plan to create a governance proposal, for allocating a portion of the remainder of 14% airdrop tokens to beacon chain contract depositors, anybody interested in discussing this get in touch with me via twitter *my username ",

But for whatever its worth, under \u201cpriced out of ethereum\u201d the threshold seems to be high IMO.  2 transactions a week on L1 is not a cheap endeavor for smaller capital users (like me).  If we were \u201cpriced out of ethereum\u201d it was because we couldn\u2019t afford to transact very often at all on L1 so we used other L2s to participate.  It just seems to me it isn\u2019t accurately named.  Maybe \u201cL2 explorers\u201d would be more accurate.  If you want to hit users who used bridges to expand to L2\u2019s because we don\u2019t have that kind of money then transacting twice a week on L1 is not us.  The earlier adaptors and more wealthy definitely hit that mark.  I think it just depends what the goal of that category was, but either way probably not the most accurate name. ",

Feels like it is unfairly weighted to an L1 Eth user, as those that made donations via Zksync did not qualify. I feel like if the criteria is called \u201cGitcoin Donors\u201d it shouldn\u2019t be about the chain the donation was made on, but the fact that the address has made a Gitcoin donation. If this criteria is included in future rounds, please consider donations that have been made on Zksync (and other chains if applicable). Thank you  ",

If the user can check the breakdown with the bots, it will save lots of effort in managing discord and have more meaningful discussions about the future airdrops.

Additionally, I have some concerns about the global filter in airdrop #1, especially for the snapshot\u2019s bot-catching proposal. It\u2019s an efficient tool to filter out the farmers but it will also lead to some false positive cases (real users voted on this proposal by accident) because it didn\u2019t check the on-chain activities. It would be better to use different filters to cross-check a single wallet adress. At last, thanks for your great work. ",

My suggestion would be to include zksync gitcoin donations in the next airdrop round, perhaps make it so that they also had to be optimism users as well as zksync and also use the original cut off dates for airdrop #1 for that criteria to keep it fair?

For me, sybil is one of the biggest roadblocks for decentralized governance many projects seeking for, and it is dramatically difficult to remove them once too late (already claimed all tokens). Based on my observations, I saw that there is a large scale of sybil on Juno chain (on Cosmos) where someone knew the criteria and gamed it. Now the community is finding ways to remove that large account but it would cause many drawbacks too (ref) Regarding Hop approach, I understand that some people would like to let OP use the same approach. Personally I think it may open up loopholes for OP since we have >1 times of airdrops. Given this situation, sybil farmers can game it and then report themselves. So, I would love to suggest 3 sources of addresses to be investigated:  OP team Leverage sybils identified by Hop approach Open for community to submit potential sybil addresses (out of #1 and #2) without any reward - there is still an indirect incentive for OP holders to identify due to less circulation supply (those sybils will not be claimable).

It wouldn\u2019t really be a problem in Optimism governance as we have the Token House & the Citizens\u2019 House. With that being said, there are some pros for not excluding sybil attackers.   A sybil attackers provides the network with many transactions, creating a stress test environment and reduces overall transaction fees for everyone.   Generally the attackers are first to sell allowing people who missed out on the airdrop to join the adventure by acquiring some undervalued tokens. This in turn can further distribute the token to many more people.   Disclaimer: I did not sybil attack Optimism. Request: If you are a sybil attacker please consider delegating  to me  ",

Question is, do they deserve to be blocked?? Imo this category will dump their tokens very quick. If wanted they can be excluded by taking out all wallets with less than 5 transactions. Sybil attackers, as others pointed out many people abused the system as they always does, i think these ones should be taken out 100%, those easily seen sending funds from 1 wallet to 20+ wallets and then farming with the same activity on all of those wallets. These type will also dump the tokens, and with difference with the above category, they are getting thousands and thousands of them to dump for each person. I like the approach HOP is taking, take out the ones that are farming in huge amounts (i think they took out 20+ connected wallets with shady behaviour and considering those above 10+ depending on behaviour) ",

I could have botted, and I guess if not filtering out all sybil attacks to the best of ability is optimisms approach I certainly would make it a point to bot in the future, because thats acceptable here to many apparently. Been using optimism a long while, decided to check governance for the first time and this is the first thread I read. Man. Initial post started so positive too. Very lame to see so much pro sybil discussion. Eliminate every last sybil farmer you can find. Quite disapointed in the general acceptance of sybil farmers over here on optimism. Just reward real people for real things, incentivize legit users that arent gaming an airdrop. Real users should be part of governance, unless you really want the top ten bots running your chain. For every huge sybil farmer eliminated the little guy gets more say, more tokens, and thats a stronger community. ",

I get it some might have real 1-5 wallets bc one its for multisig, different type of hot wallets, a ledger, etc\u2026 But those who have 20+ wallets its near imposible they are not sybil attackers and going just for a quick profit and exit the space, providing nothing. I also at some point thinked about doing sybil, i havent, but if the sybil attackers are rewarded in this airdrop #1 , why wouldnt we all do the same for airdrop #2? Thats the sad part, we have the first airdrop and the second one announced for the future, if we give sybil attackers a free pass, for the second airdrop will be a chaos (and more because the allocation is bigger). Optimism has a new ethos no other has put into the table, allowing these farmers to take a huge % will go against to all of Optimism ideals. ",

Should we start with bridge value at least $30 and have continous tx  atleast 2 times for continuous x weeks. For \u201cPriced out of ethereum\u201d that need 2tx a week on L1 are not cheap. As for me, I try every efford to avoid using L1. So thats make me not in the criteria for airdrop.  ",

Its more than 3000+ if you count 4 categories. Its a lot of wallets. I think these kind of wallets are most probably to participate in governance, active members, holders, etc. I know a lot of people -as myself- that if we start gathering all their wallets they might get into the 4+ categories, i would welcome that but i think that then there wont be much distinction between categories.

For Airdrop #2, I\u2019d propose filtering out people who received OP from the first airdrop and have subsequently sold their airdropped OP tokens.  If the OP token primarily represents responsibility in the OP community, it seems inconsistent to then bestow MORE responsibility via Airdrop #2 on addresses/individuals who already offloaded the responsibility received from Airdrop #1.

I use at least 20 Dapps on optimism on a regular basis, and want to be active in governance. What you suggest would exclude me, an active OP user who some days pays $100 in transaction fees and has a desire to actively participate in governance. So because I profited off my OP tokens and you did not I should be excluded? This is a bad idea. I hold OP tokens too, and I am an active daily user. Maybe consider people who dumped 100% and never interacted but stances like the one above are unreasonable at best and ridiculous at worst. This is crypto, people trade their tokens to profit. Tomorrow I\u2019ll hold the same amount of OP but have profited along the way. If I remember correctly part of Optimisms mission statement states that profitability is very important. I very much align with this viewpoint. I should not be excluded while I own hundreds of OP tokens and have much more locked on Optimism. ",

OP Team has mentioned this earlier too, they are not against selling and no one should be. I can still agree on giving incremental reward, like you sold 50% of your claimed stack in 24hr, you will get less reward in comparison to someone who sold after 1 week.  Just like we did this time, different criteria and different reward but blocking them is wrong and I dont support it. If you dont want them to sell, give them a soul bound NFT.

This should not be encouraged and I would vote to discard those addresses.

If you believe in this then price was the main factor for claiming as soon as possible. Why would they rush the claim otherwise? I\u2019m still not sure if it was a bad thing, overall it was neutral and a nice stress test to the network. ",

I thank the optimism team for not doing that and that is what increases my trust in the project by many folds. Not every small investor is an airdrop farmer. The point can be clearly seen by looking at the accounts who sell their $OP and who don\u2019t sell. Why are the people who got the largest amount of airdrop and dump it, not called airdrop farmers? People who get small allocation of $OP have a very good reason to sell $OP and get some much needed money. So, if they are not selling their $OP (believe me it is very hard to resist), that says something about their trust in the project and community. So, I think that optimism should keep that in mind moving forward and accordingly reward such accounts and not the ACTUAL AIRDROP FARMERS who already have a lot of money and get huge chunks of airdrop and sell it to tank the project. It could be an experiment worth doing if we aim to bring the crypto to masses. ",

Loved the delegator selection system with the themes and all, although technically this forces users to choose a delegator in a short window meaning more risk of delegator concentration. A pseudo-random selection from a voted list could be a nice concept too for those who are not educated / don\u2019t have time to look at it. Otherwise might reproduce same flaws as in traditional system and politics. A bit disappointed with zkSync not being taken in account for Gitcoin donations especially with the \u201ccombined criteria\u201d system but at the same time this is free tokens and more energy needed to be spent for bot filtering and criteria design itself. Not the first project struggling with zkSync in their airdrop so I imagine this is an harder thing to do (or that Gitcoin got sybil-ed with it ?) About future airdrops, I am not sure if they should be done to EOA or directly to the projects building on Optimism (those projects can then individually decide how they distribute to EOAs) ",

I think there is a lot of discussion about airdrop dumpers and how to effectively get users not to dump but actually play the positive sum game! I think is has to be the game theory that incentives are not just earned by being an early adopter but by continuing to be part of the ecosystem and actually contributing. I guess there is a need to be able to measure contibutions to be able to reward and retain net positive users. This will turn to a flywheel affect and will attract more net positive contributors. I think also future airdrops that are big in size should think about having a vesting period and a way to accelerate vesting based on positive contribution. This way users will actually try out to be part of the community rather than just harvest the airdrop and move on! If we even have an increased retention of 10 or 20% more users that actually contributed I am sure it will be great for the ecosystem! ",

There was no OP even on the CMC hot search on the first day of the launch. The team was too low-key, or there were problems with marketing ideas, and they failed to cooperate with several CEX joint activities in advance. It is clear that BINANCE, CB, and FTX have indicated in advance that they will launch OP transactions, but obviously the team has not Actively contacted the person in charge of the platform for negotiation, which resulted in the Binance recharge OP being stuck for 24 hours (perhaps to protest the marketing failure of the optimistic team), so the project wants to develop rapidly and gain strong support from the market, the team still needs to learn better marketing and co-op strategy!

Priced out of Ethereum  One can make the point that this is similar to the point i raised above. Also, while this is not specific to OP, i think the industry needs to come up with better ways of quantifying airdrop eligibility. im sure there are people just like me who use different wallets for different chains. we continued transacting on L1 via a different wallet. Yes, sometimes things cross over when u need funds quickly on another chain, so you bridge. but bummed nonethless to get penalized for practicing \u201csecurity hygiene\u201d using diff wallets for diff chains.

The timing of the airdrop seemed good at the time, as it looked like there was a market recovery about to happen. Unfortunately, there was a small correction after it, bringing down OP with it. As the market is recovering, OP is going up aggressively as well. TLDR; on that point, unlucky timing but it doesn\u2019t matter in the end.  On punishing past airdrop participants It\u2019s good to define what the goals of the airdrop are. Immediately after the first airdrop, there was a forum post suggesting that no one who sold their tokens should be eligible for future airdrops. People may sell for a variety of reasons.  For example, airdrops are taxed as income the moment they are received, so it\u2019s responsible to sell some to set aside for taxes. Was the purpose of the airdrop so no one would sell the airdrop? If so, then yes, not giving an airdrop to people who sold it seems reasonable. But is the purpose of the airdrop to distribute governance, or to incentivize people to use Optimism? If so, I don\u2019t think withholding an airdrop from users of the network is aligned with those goals.  Governance experience of the airdrop With regards to the experience with the previous airdrop. My understanding is OP is mainly a governance token. So, I would have liked more transparency around how to participate in governance from the Optimism website. I had to ask around in Discord to get this information, and it took a while to get the answers I was looking for. For example, the process for how delegates were chosen in the claims page wasn\u2019t clear to me. Or how new people were to be added to it. Also, there is an option to delegate anyone not listed, even your own address. However, there\u2019s no guidance on where to go from there. There was no link to the page where votes take place. The option to delegate to someone not listed in the page, to delegate whoever you\u2019d like, was hard to find as well. If I were to purchase OP tokens, for example, my intention would be to participate in governance directly, as the best way to make sure your representative votes the way you want is by being your own representative. We have the technology now where electing representatives is no longer a requirement. There\u2019s no one room people need to be in to sign off on decisions like there were in ~1787 when the US government was created. We can discuss online. And we use token allocation proven onchain to weigh votes. So this barrier to participate in governance as an individual I\u2019m not a fan of. If the main purpose of OP token isn\u2019t governance, then I\u2019m open to being corrected. ",

And I realized that the underlying technology behind this, streams with continuous settlement and per-second (to be technically correct: per-block) netting, could be very much an exciting new way to airdrop tokens. Imagine a \u201ccontinous\u201d airdrop over a period of, for example, 6 months. An airdrop wouldn\u2019t be something users would interact with once, dumping them I assume in many cases, but a month-long experience where users receive tokens each day, actually every second. There are good reasons to believe that this could - relative to a one-off airdrop - be a much more powerful mechanism to create a loyal group of people, who\u2019re all committed to seeing Optimism flourish. I\u2019ve observed with airdrop #1 that many eligible users bridged ETH to Optimism, claimed the airdrop, and bridged back with the funds. My suggested airdrop distribution would make this impossible. To play with open cards here: While I do not have any business relations with Superfluid, I do have personal ones. I\u2019m open to discuss this with the team in more depth and also connect you to with the people behind Superfluid if you want to explore this idea further. Also would love to talk about some ideas I have to improve sybil resistance and filter both amateurish and more sophisticated airdrop farmers. ",

I loved how easy it was to claim, and the steps users had to take before receiving (e.g. briefing the users on the Optimism Collective). With that being said, there is always room for improvement:   Given the inherent \u201cfarming\u201d mentality which people get upon airdrop announcements, it would be reasonable to not give away the exact day/week/month subsequent airdrops will occur. This will help filter out some airdrop farmers.   I have seen some people request for an in-depth list of what the airdrop criteria is made up of, but I do think that it has some risks of targeted transactions to effectively farm the future airdrops.   Timing is definitely a key factor in airdrops. From what I have noticed, token airdrops most commonly get dumped 1-2 weeks after the airdrop itself.   Airdropping a token during a bear market does somewhat incentivise users - even more - to sell the airdrop off to remain liquid.   Airdropping a token during a bull market may stunt the token price appreciation in the short term: while the rest of the altcoins are pumping, your token is getting dumped because it got airdropped.   But don\u2019t get me wrong, threading such a needle in airdrop timing is incredibly difficult. It does require a substantial amount of luck and faith in your community to hold the fundamental principles and values of the token close enough that they wouldn\u2019t paper hand them upon claim.   Another thing that relates to token prices after an airdrop is the airdrop size. We all want big airdrops, because that means big money. But, reducing the size of the airdrop does make the user think twice about selling right of the bat.  Yet another needle to thread: the balance between an airdrop proportion fair enough to keep people happy, and an airdrop proportion insignificant enough that people won\u2019t sell  Instead of granting lump-sums of airdrops in 1-4 phases, maybe stretch it out a bit more to about 5-10? Not sure what the broader community feels about this, would like to hear some thoughts on this.   Lastly, expanding token use cases in DeFi. This will help reduce sellers in the short term, while providing more options and usability of the token in the long-run. For example, hardly any protocols have a farm for single-staking $OP - many community members including myself are keeping an eye out for the \u201cbig-names\u201d of DeFi to implement this, such as Aave for example.  This was a problem which some DAOs (I shall not name them) that I participated in have. Expanding use cases of the token (e.g. more dApp implementation) will incentivise airdrop receivers to utilise their airdropped tokens in helping grow the Optimism ecosystem.    I have made some points on token price as I hate to see the community feel down after watching their tokens fall in price. As much we\u2019re all in here for the tech and values, we must remind ourselves to keep our heads up during downturns. If we can\u2019t do it ourselves, then better tokenomics must be implemented to help us. Moral and narratives matter more in crypto than anywhere else, we must remain optimistic. I would like to end this by saying, thanks for the great work Optimism - we\u2019re all looking forward for future advancements and developments. ",

This could also be used to motivate the person receiving the airdrop to follow the criteria. Optimism can come up with a criteria which stimulates growth in the optimism network.     dippudo:  Airdropping a token during a bear market does somewhat incentivise users - even more - to sell the airdrop off to remain liquid.
