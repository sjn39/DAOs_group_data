Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019   GFX Labs steps into the Delegate circle! They will participate in Meet Your Delegate #6 on November 17th. PECU introduces the Maker Wormhole, allowing almost instantaneous teleportation of DAI between supported L2s and ETH. There\u2019s fresh updates to the Governance Portal! Check it out!    ICYMI - Announcements DssBlow: Making Surplus Buffer Repayments Easy - @lollike from the CES Core Unit introduces DssBlow, a new helper smart contract that makes it easy for Core Units to repay excess Dai to the MakerDAO Surplus Buffer. With DssBlow, you can send ERC20 Dai directly to the DssBlow contract address. Once Dai has been received by DssBlow, anyone can call on the new blow() function to send all deposited Dai in DssBlow as internal Dai to the Surplus Buffer. MakerDAO Actual Expenses vs. Budget - September 2021 - With the recent discussion around our Core Units actual expenses versus the approved and on-chain budgets shown on Makerburn, it was important to express their divergences. @Aes took the liberty to work with the Core Units to publish their actual expenses incurred during July, August, and September. The provided reconciliation shows that we are actually $0.9M less profitable than reported in September and $1.4M more profitable on a YTD basis. Check out the post for more data! GFX Labs Delegate Platform - @GFXlabs announces their Delegate Platform! The GFXlabs community desires to be active participants in Maker Governance and provide communication behind their votes. To learn more about their Delegate Platform, check out the Meet Your Delegate Call #6 on November 17th. Introducing Maker Wormhole - Maker Wormhole definitely takes the spotlight with their logo! The PECU introduces DAI Wormholing - the ability for almost instantaneous teleportation of DAI between supported Layer 2s and Ethereum. The design is fully trustless and allows system participants to bridge virtually unlimited liquidity through instantaneous minting of DAI on the destination domain. L2 \u2192 L1 fast withdrawal should be available in Q1 2022, and the complete Wormhole features should be available in Q2 2022. Check out the post for a technical breakdown of Maker Wormhole. Governance Portal Release v0.2.3 - November 8th - DUX Core Unit at it again with some fresh Governance Portal updates. Some featured updates include: Delegate voting weight chart, badges for poll categories, MKR needed to pass an executive vote, unique avatars For Shadow Delegates, owner badge displayed on Delegate cards, MKR amount locked in Chief, and more!

You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 [preMIP] IAM for Surplus Buffer - Historically, we have always tried to keep the Surplus to Non-Stablecoin DAI Ratio roughly between 1% and 2%. However, controlling the Surplus Buffer becomes more difficult with more collaterals onboarded and the rapid growth of DAI supply forming conflicted community sentiments. In response, @ultraschuppi submitted a pre-MIP discussion proposing that we introduce an Instant Access Module that would allow any user to adjust the Surplus Buffer based on parameters decided by Maker Governance. He provides dimensions and parameters in the post and seeks feedback and community discussion on this idea. [Informal Poll] Prioritize D3M Rollout to Compound - With the successful rollout of D3M to Aave, @PaperImperium wants to gauge the sentiment of the community to make it a priority to extend the D3M to Compound. He lays out the pros and cons, and asks \u201cShould Integrating Compound Into D3M Be Prioritized?\u201d If \u2018Yes\u2019 votes outnumber \u2018No,\u2019 an on-chain poll will be presented to vote upon the prioritization of adding Compound to D3M. MKR will be eligible collateral for the FIAT DAO Jubilee program - FIAT DAO enters the building by introducing their new protocol, FDT (FIAT DAO Token) Jubilee, which is a Proof-of-Capital program. MKR holders will be able to stake in the FDT Jubilee. FIAT DAO presents a value proposition for FIAT and wants to provide a diversified form of collateral to be used by the MakerDAO system. Centrifuge Collateral: A way forward with a Delaware Statutory Trust and the Arranger Model - @roollie introduces Centrifuge Collateral and presents an Arranger idea with MakerDAO. The Centrifuge team begins by addressing legal concerns brought by the community along with their next steps, which involve bringing RWA on-chain into Maker as collateral in a scalable and sustainable way (with Maker as one of their key partners). They introduce their proposal and seek feedback and discussion from the community. Proposal: Add Kattana: cross-chain trading terminal for DEXs and CEXs, to the app ecosystem of MakerDAO - First-time poster, @Ilya_KTN, introduces Kattana, which is a project that works with big data to provide any requested information that can be used to create new products and apps. @Ilya_KTN proposes for Maker to add the Kattana cross-chain trading terminal to the MakerDao ecosystem and allow the ability for developers to freely use trading data. He promotes that collaboration can speed up DAO solutions while significantly improving the experience for MakerDAO ecosystem apps users.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 [Signal Request] Increasing the Surplus Buffer (2021-11) - Signal Closes November 19th - @ultraschuppi is signaling to the community in request to increase the Surplus Buffer. He asks the community where we want to set the Surplus Buffer and whether to keep burning some of the profits. [Signal Request] New vault-type for WBTC with a higher LR - Signal Closes November 19th - DAI minted from WBTC has recently been increasingly popular with the amount of DAI being tripled within the last month. A large market downturn on WBTC vaults running with a higher Liquidation Ratio is less likely to undergo liquidations, resulting in a loss for the protocol and the vault owner. In response, @ultraschuppi signals to the community, asking whether we should add a new WBTC-based vault type with a higher LR.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community. Check out this thread for more posts related to delegation. Where to Find Opportunities at MakerDAO - Looking for job opportunities at MakerDAO?

Links reflect my view of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories right now. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or a pm.  Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019   @rune posted a comprehensive design further explaining the Sagittarius Engine. MakerDAO can be potentially exempt from certain regulatory prohibitions concerning stablecoins.  Makerburn.com has a bunch of new updates! Check them out!    ICYMI - Announcements Sagittarius Engine - Following up on last week\u2019s presented initiative for Clean Money @rune submits a comprehensive thread on the design for the Sagittarius Engine, which will better direct the value flows of the Maker Protocol towards long term governance participants. However, this is just one of the many mentioned benefits of the design. Check out the whole post for a deeper understanding of the Sagittarius Engine. Maker vs. Redemption-Based Stablecoins Under Glass-Steagall - @PaperImperium circles back to a recent discussion on the impact of US-based financial regulation towards the crypto economy. However, this time @PaperImperium presents potentially good news; Gaining favor in some circles is the notion that an unrepealed section of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act provides a more clear direction for MakerDAO. There are three exemptions to the Act, which can well-position MakerDAO if deemed a loan-guarantee protocol. Take Initiative: One Principle for an Autonomous DAO - Seeking consent has been socially integrated into human behavior. Although MakerDAO community and members have distanced themselves from such conduct, @LongForWisdom identifies some of its existence. In response, @LongForWisdom posted a thread containing words of advice to help take the initiative, prevent potential blockers, and even offers recent examples of people who have learned to internalized these principles. Investing our liquidity in short-term ETF, managing PSMs exposures - @SebVentures follows up on a previous poll and this week\u2019s RWA Committee discussion on investing in financial assets. His post includes an overview of their idea, legal structures, and brokers and concludes with their next steps. New Silver September 2021 Update @prankstr25 from NewSilver announced that they have been working on a way to improve and speed up the collateral valuation process. The post includes their Collateral Valuation Improvement Proposal along with other relevant information. SES Project Real-World Sandbox - @luca_pro initiates a thread to promote collaboration in an SES-backed project named Real-World Sandbox. It will be a 5-week intense project that will give everybody the occasion to contribute and shape Maker\u2019s role within the monetary and lending stack. Makerburn updates, October 2021 - @makerburn announces updates to makerburn.com, which include the addition of stablecoin ratio, total value locked (TVL) added to the main dashboard, profit estimate 24h change, custom sorting of collaterals, notification bubbles, clickable protocol expenses, and Makerburn Moments.  Evaluations, Audits, and Reports [wstETH] Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment (MIP10c3-SP42) Looking for more posts and updates? Check out the weekly updates and summaries from our teams and Core Units.   Active Discussions  \u2018What\u2019s going on? You think what?! You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Build a US Political Strategy - MakerDAO needs to have some kind of regulatory strategy for the US and other major jurisdictions. @PaperImperium builds a discussion thread to promote a community brainstorm on what we see as significant challenges and how to address them. @PaperImperium presents his response to the issue along with potential solutions. [Informal Poll] How Important Is Decentralized Governance? - There has been a lot of discussion around mitigation of legal tail risks for Maker as a DAO. To help better understand the communities opinions, @PaperImperium asks how important is it for a DAO like ours to have decentralized governance? Request to raise the G-UNI DC to 50M - Following the recent onboarding of G-UNI and the subsequent 10M debt ceiling being reached, Protocol Engineering, Risk, and Oracle Core Units would like to propose raising the G-UNI debt ceiling to 50M. Would you like to use part of the 3 billion USDC to buy back MKR token? - @Mikkkkk believes the MKR token is undervalued and creates a discussion to gauge the community and MKR token holder\u2019s interest on a plan to borrow 10% of the three billion USDC at 0% interest to buyback MKR token over 12 months. Proposal: deploy leveraged ETH to reduce USDC risk - With 3 billion USDC in the PSM, @dalin addressed concern on revenues and associated risks. He proposes to deploy a new leveraged ETH product that is scalable. @dalin provides some objectives and examples in the thread.  Ongoing Discussions:  \u2018Who said discussions should end after a week!?\u2019 The Case for Clean Money - MakerDAO has significantly evolved over several years. With so much opportunity ahead of us, @rune envisions Maker reaching its true potential by becoming a purpose-driven DAO with a compelling vision; He promotes that we can use the power of DeFi to adopt the principle of Clean Money and Sustainable Finance to help coordinate a global build-out of sustainable energy pathways for clean energy projects. The core of his Clean Money initiative consists of a tokenomics system called the Sagittarius Engine, which would replace itself as the destination of Maker\u2019s protocol surplus and provide a tangible benefit to MKR holders who lock up their MKR into governance for long term periods. Much more information and deeper discussion are found in the post.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Would you like to see MakerDAO move in the general direction indicated by the post \u2018The Case for Clean Money\u2019? - In reaction to the initiative for Clean Money, @LongForWisdom creates an initial signal asking the community whether they would like to see MakerDAO move in the general direction indicated by the post \u2018The Case for Clean Money.\u2019 Should we trial Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 over three months? - @LongForWisdom believes the best path forward with Recognised Delegate compensation is to run a three month trial period according to the system proposed by @psychonaut in MIP61. @LongForWisdom asks whether we should trial Recognised Delegate compensation as described in MIP61 over the next three months? Set PSM fees to 0% - @SebVentures has been diligently pushing the idea to set PSM fees to 0%; which is also suggested in The Case for Clean Money. If their signal were to pass, Sebastien provides many long-term pros and cons and discusses how setting PSM fees to 0% would anchor the perception that 1 DAI = $1. Restarted poll [Signal Request] Raise the ESM threshold to 15% and increase the Governance Delay to 4 days - Maker is reaching a point where the core Maker security is so battle-tested that the emergency shutdown feature (ES) is beginning to become a risk rather than a solution; with only 75,000 MKR currently needed to trigger ES, it is the most likely place for someone to try to damage the system. @rune proposes to double the trigger amount to 150,000 MKR, which will reduce the risk of a sudden ES and make the system more reliable.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community. Check out this thread for more posts related to delegation. Where to Find Opportunities at MakerDAO - Looking for job opportunities at MakerDAO?

There have been a few references in the forums about getting more small-scale MKR holders involved with governance. I am sure that this is a very common refrain, but as someone keen to get more involved with Maker, it has been pretty taxing to stay on top of every single forum thread that goes through the Maker forum in a given week. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why this very handy \u2018Forum at a Glance\u2019 was brought in and I really appreciate it. My question is, is there more streamlining that can be done for people like me who want to get more involved with Maker? I don\u2019t pretend to know exactly which threads are vital to have their own space, and those that do not, but this definitely stands out for a relative newcomer to Maker governance as a problem. Particularly compared to most DeFi projects that only use their forums for key/important posts or Snapshots, Maker has a lot going on! I definitely don\u2019t mean to suggest the forums are poorly managed, the moderators do an excellent job - but I\u2019m wondering if there are plans I might not be aware of about flattening the learning/information curve for governance newcomers. There are some cool ideas from other DAOs I\u2019m part of that could be easily stolen for Maker\u2019s benefit. ",

I also see that a Maker Discord server is about to get off the ground which is another great tool. This is possibly a silly question and I might be missing an obvious place to look, but is there a page or thread that sets out exactly what all of the Maker CUs are and what the scope of each of their roles are? As someone who has been passively following Maker for a while, I\u2019ve always wondered where exactly (for instance) the boundaries are between CUs, like between the Growth CU and the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU.

RWA Strategy Update - Being more strategic - Following up on ideas presented in their previous RWF report, @SebVentures posts an update on the Real World Finance Core Unit to use strategic value for work prioritization and no longer focus on the number of MIP6 onboarded. The team presents new objectives and long-term goals\u2013Awesome to see! RWA Foundation #001 - RWA Foundation - @SebVentures posts a thread documenting the RWA Foundation to push transparency further and provide an open-source as a reference for the construction and management of future MIP58: RWA Foundation.

Woohoo! @bainpm from the DUX Core Unit posted an update for version 0.2.2, including improved verifiability & testnet migration, a details tab for spells, improved linked resources, and a colorful vote breakdown progress bar. Mid-month Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 2021-10-15 - There\u2019s been a lot of appetite for DAI minting, especially on ETH-A, ETH-B and WBTC-A. The temporary cap was reached for ETH-A and WBTC-A, and new DAI can only get minted as soon as the ttl is over. To keep up with the demand, the PPG proposed changes to the DC-IAM parameters for those vault types as a mid-month parameter proposal outlined in MIP46. Check out the associated Signal Requests below. Looking for more posts and updates? Check out the weekly updates and summaries from our teams and Core Units.   Active Discussions  \u2018What\u2019s going on? You think what?! You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Adding utility to MKR token (discount stability fees for vault owners who hold MKR) - @sasa believes there should be more utility benefits to the MKR token to help MakerDAO benefit from new DeFi developments and increase our dominance in the lending market. @sasa presents an idea for discount stability fees for vault owners who hold MKR. This can help incentivize asset managers to own and store MKR. Check it out and leave your feedback. [Discussion] Making Maker fractionally reserved (originally posted on Reddit) - With a little over 50% of DAI backed by stablecoins, @samskiter raises the question of whether DAI is completely an algorithmic stablecoin? In response to this, @samskiter proposes fraction reserves for DAI where the proportion of unbacked DAI is controlled by governance votes and careful analysis of the historical demand for DAI. The post also includes two strategies for fraction reserves and is open for discussion. Issues with our governance process and delegate compensation - Delegate compensation continues to be a controversial and critical topic for discussion. @AstronautThis posts a thread addressing some issues with the governance process being followed for Delegate compensation. Astro believes that the MIP61 process should be followed and polled on-chain along with any successful signal requests. Astro also believes that Delegates should abstain from polls and votes involving their Delegate compensation. Finally, the post contains some thoughts for long-term solutions. Check it out! Slow automatic debt ceiling increases - There have been many cases lately where popular vault types reach their temporary debt ceilings, which sometimes stops the issuance of new debt. @makerburn is concerned that these avoidable pauses in DAI issuance push potential users to similar services like Aave or Compound. @makerburn provides some suggestions and seeks community feedback on the topic. Blipper - extending the Clipper to support B.Protocol liquidation mechanism - TL;DR: @yaronvel posts a thread proposing a smart contract that extends the Clipper implementation, with a Blipper which tries to execute the liquidation over B.Protocol, and if it fails, it reverts to the standard Clipper liquidation process. Check out the thread for more details on this proposal.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Should we increase Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144k DAI for the initial three-month delegate compensation trial? - Signal Closes November 4th - In response to previous signals and discussion, @LongForWisdom proposes a higher compensation for Delegates and asks the community whether we should increase the Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144,000 DAI for the initial three-month Delegate compensation trial?

Set PSM fees to 0% - Signal Closes October 25th - @SebVentures has been diligently pushing the idea to set PSM fees to 0%; which is also suggested in The Case for Clean Money. If their signal were to pass, Sebastien provides many long-term pros and cons and discusses how setting PSM fees to 0% would anchor the perception that 1 DAI = $1.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community.

Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Increasing the Surplus Buffer (2021-11) - Signal Closes November 19th - @ultraschuppi is signaling to the community in request to increase the Surplus Buffer. He asks the community where we want to set the Surplus Buffer and keep burning some profits. New vault-type for WBTC with a higher LR - Signal Closes November 19th - DAI minted from WBTC has recently been increasingly popular with the amount of DAI being tripled within the last month. A large market downturn on WBTC vaults running with a higher Liquidation Ratio is less likely to undergo liquidations, resulting in a loss for the protocol and the vault owner. In response, @ultraschuppi signals to the community, asking whether we should add a new WBTC-based vault type with a higher LR. Burn Baby Burn! [Burn The MKR Treasury] - Signal Closes November 26th - @aburban90 asks the community to burn half of MKR in the treasury and use the remainder to vest Core Units. Should We Mint New MKR for Protocol Expenses or Fund Them With MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury? - Signal Closes November 27th - There is no clear indication about what should be the source of the MKR used for future expenses. @Patrick_J presents two options: Use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury or Mint new MKR using the PauseProxy. Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-4) - Signal Closes November 25th - With gas and ETH prices continuing to go up, our dust limits offer less protection against losses. In response, @monet-supply proposes whether we should increase dust limits for all Vault types. One-time Payment to COM-001 to Cover Missing DssVest Funds - Signal Closes November 26th - The original DSSVest stream for the Governance Communications Core Unit was configured incorrectly, resulting in an unclaimed 39,300 Dai. Initially, the team believed they could slide through their 4-month stream period using the buffer and other savings. However, legal services and additional expenses recently arose, which pushed @Davidutro to formally ask the community whether they support a one-off governance request for a one-time payment of 27,058.33 Dai.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community.

ICYMI - Announcements [WBTC-B] and [WBTC-BProt-A]: Review and Plan of Action  - Recent forum discussions (1, 2, 3) that imply a bullish market outlook and a consequent increased demand for DAI minting, suggest that several parameter changes and vault upgrades may be necessary. The Risk Core Unit believes that the time is right to introduce a WBTC-B vault with a lower liquidation ratio, which will help absorb the increased demand for WBTC capital and generate more DAI. In addition, the Risk Core Unit believes that we should also onboard the WBTC-BProt-A vault supported by the community. These vaults can be worked on in tandem.

Check out MYD episode 7. New Governance Portal updates are here. Check them out. MATIC token is formally signaled to be offboarded.     ICYMI - Announcements [Nexo Institutional Vault] Collateral Onboarding \u2013 Update - @Nadia published an update on the Nexo institutional vault, which already minted its 1.5B DC using only the ETH-A vault. This pushed the Risk, RWF, PECU, and Growth Teams to work on the second version of the Nexo IV proposal, which they will share very soon! Governance Portal Release v0.2.4 - November 23rd - The DUX Team released the Governance Portal v0.2.4.

Let @content-production know if anyone is interested in sponsoring bounties, offering swag, and engaging with attendees and each other. Proposal: Use the ENS airdrop to subsidize MKR holder onboarding into ENS - @sirverik proposes to use a fraction of the ENS tokens held in the treasury to incentivize holders of MKR to onboard themselves into the ENS space, which can be seen as a rebate on the gas fees to MKR holders who decide to register a Primary ENS name. Proposal to Increase the D3M DC from 50M to 100M - The Direct Deposit Module has hit its current debt ceiling of 50M. Protocol Engineering and Risk Teams are proposing to increase the D3M DC to 100M.

One-time Payment to COM-001 to Cover Missing DssVest Funds - Signal Closes November 26th - The original DSSVest stream for the Governance Communications Core Unit was configured incorrectly, resulting in an unclaimed 39,300 Dai. Initially, the team believed they could slide through their 4-month stream period using the buffer and other savings. However, legal services and additional expenses recently arose, which pushed @Davidutro to formally ask the community whether they support this one-off governance request.

Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-4) - Signal Closes November 25th - With gas and ETH prices continuing to go up, our dust limits offer less protection against losses. In response, @monet-supply proposes whether we should increase dust limits for all Vault types.

Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  This is the final week for all Governance related activity! Happy holidays! Check out makerburn for new updates.  Check out the new and updated Unified Auctions UI Release.     ICYMI - Announcements Multiple Testnet Deprecation - The Protocol Engineering Team is deprecating the Kovan, Ropsten, and Rinkeby deployments from changelog.makerdao.com. The Goerli testnet will continue being maintained and updated. The Kovan test deployment was officially supported and deprecated in August of 2021 due to Kovan test network reaching the end of support in openethereum. Users should migrate test contracts to our Goerli deployment, which PECU continues to maintain. Affected users can continue using the previous contracts in the simulation. However, no further updates will be made to those deployments. Developers can simulate tests against our mainnet deployment, switch to Goerli testnet, or deploy a copy of dss in a local testchain using dss-deploy-scripts. Makerburn updates, December 2021 - @makerburn publish their most recent updates! Makerburn website now contains improved dashboard statistics, burn auctions features, a new chart visualizing recent liquidations, a new treasury page showing assets currently controlled by the DAO, new dashboard alerts, and makerburn bot upgrades along with other minor updates. Unified Auctions UI Release v0.3.2 - December 10th, 2021 - The Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit present their Unified Auctions UI Release, which aims to provide a one-stop solution that redirects users to relevant resources related to auctions. This includes the different UIs participating in either collateral, surplus, or debt auction. But we also included auction-related analytics tools as well as existing keeper implementations. It also includes an adjustable outcome wallet, which allows users to specify the receiver address. SAS also includes other changes along with a sneak peek into their upcoming features. BIS, Maker, and rigging for sailing closer to the wind - The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has released their quarterly review that features DeFi and Maker, specifically. The BIS review provides some good starting points for adjusting ourselves for upwind sailing along with this cold war of regulations. @Allan_Pedersen breaks down the BIS\u2019 concerns and provides some policy response recommendations, essentially structuring MakerDAO in a way to allow it for smoother sailing when it comes down to DeFi regulations. NB: BIS quarterly review does not reflect official BIS positions. Looking for more posts and updates? Check out the weekly updates and summaries from our teams and Core Units.

Instead, he asks the community what makes everyone so passionate about Maker. Have any interesting comments on this? Jump in and post your stories! EthDenver call for sponsorship - After meeting the People of Maker in Paris at EthCC, @ultraschuppi was once more confirmed the value to meet in person and not only through zoom and chat. He believes it would be helpful to include Recognized Delegates into these events - e.g., be part of intros and meetings in the presence of Growth Core Unit. However, Delegates don\u2019t have a travel budget. @ultraschuppi has tickets for EthDenver 2022 and is looking for a Core Unit to sponsor those travel expenses. Schuppi Recent Musings - Currently, the platform-threads is summarizing the onchain actions of the Recognized Delegates. This gives a good overview of our thinking process results, but it does not give any hints about what is going on before making our decisions. @ultraschuppi asks the community whether it would be helpful to provide additional updates about the thinking process when voting. Should we have this as something where the community interacts with an individual delegate? Unsolicited Advice - @TheExistence treats us with their knowledge and experience by offering 68 bullets of unsolicited advice by Kevin Kelly. Whether some advice is misunderstood or astray from personal beliefs, it is still important to consider each and every one of them. [Rocking the DeFi Chasm] Will OG DeFi Applications Look to Reinvent Themselves in 2022? - @flipflopflapdelegate believes it\u2019s time for OG DeFi applications such as Maker Protocol to level up as we transition over to 2022. That\u2019s because the second half of 2021 has really cooled off the DeFi sector to the point of being undervalued, at least for Maker. Many other DeFi applications are now pushing for changes in 2022 to help improve their token or application value. This means that it\u2019s now time for Maker to cross the next frontier; the multi-blockchain future. Check out the post for more cool information and additional details.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Adjust minimum bid increase(beg) and lot size (bump) on flap-auctions - Signal Closes December 31st - Data shows that there are some inefficiencies when it comes to how we buy back MKR, such as buying 3.62% over market price. @JustinCase proposes to lower the beg to retain more value to be burned. To offset some of the disadvantages, @JustinCase would, at the same time, propose to increase the lot size. Raise Threshold For Emergency Shutdown Module - Signal Closes December 28th - Currently, 75,000 MKR would need to be burned in the ESM to allow for Emergency Shutdown. This amount now invites a risk where a single heavy MKR holder may be compelled to trigger Emergency Shutdown. @GFXlabs submits a request to determine whether to increase the ESM threshold. It is not believed that any single MKR holder has more than 100k MKR at this time. In response, @GFXlabs asks the community whether we should raise the ESM threshold to 100k MKR?   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community. Check out this thread for more posts related to delegation. Where to Find Opportunities at MakerDAO and Open positions at MakerDAO - Looking for job opportunities at MakerDAO?

Different tracks are available depending on interest and time commitment. We could always use help reviewing MIPs in the Request for Comment phase.  Feedback Survey  Please, check out the Forum at a Glance feedback survey to help us improve and scale these reviews - It will be fun, I promise.   What\u2019s Ahead? \u2018Wow! 2022 is here already!? What do we do?\u2019  Forum at a Glance 2022: The Forum at a Glance has grown to establish itself as the community\u2019s weekly forum summary. Initially, the objective was to include all posts, announcements, and discussions into the Forum at a Glance. However, there are areas for improvement, which came to my attention after collecting feedback and metrics during the last several months. In response, I have decided to dance with the styling and format a bit as we come into 2022. Next year\u2019s Forum at a Glance will contain the top 3 pertinent forum posts for announcements and discussions. Signal requests and other information will remain more or less the same. There will be minor structural changes as well to help improve reader digestibility and attractiveness. If anyone has additional feedback, please, submit it to our feedback survey above. Happy holidays to everyone! ",

Keep an eye out for future posts on this discussion. Fear, Respect, and Influence within MakerDAO - @LongForWisdom posts his opinions to help clarify the culture within the DAO and the relationship between MKR Holders and Core Unit Contributors. He touches on the recurring sentiment of fear, respect, and influence within relationships and explains that there should be a healthy balance between these emotions. The Arranger Model - a highly scalable RWA framework - With RWAs being one of the largest potential opportunities at MakerDAO, their complexity can promote some risk. In response, @rune published a simplified overview of the Arranger Model as a solution to mitigate risk when scaling RWAs. The post contains input from some of the RWA experts in the community. @rune promotes further discussion and feedback by the community to help further refine the framework. @luca_pro is currently working on a detailed report containing a formal and professional opinion on structuring highly scalable RWA capital allocation.

An Idea For Vaults 2.0 Or Advanced Vaults - @makercaesar presents an idea to help scale Vaults where a lower liquidation ratio promotes a higher liquidation dependent fee, which users can determine up by setting up their parameter for liquidation ratios. He provides a chart demonstration as an example with wBTC-ETH and presents some goals and potential problems using this idea. Double the speed of the governance cycle? - With the potential professionalization of Recognized Delegates, @psychonaut believes is it time to begin thinking about a shorter, more agile, and responsive governance cycle.

Wintermute proposes their market-making services to the Maker community. Check out Dai on Different Networks #13.     ICYMI - Announcements There has been a lot of discussion around delegate compensation and parameters. @psychonaut follows up on the subject by introducing MIP61: Delegate Compensation, a proposal describing how Recognized Delegates will be compensated. @LongForWisdom announces a new mandatory budget implementation standard for all existing and new Core Units. Reasoning: figuring out executive content for CU budgets has become time-consuming for GovAlpha. There has also been a lack of clarity in budget proposals.

You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019  Post of the Week  The case for Clean Money - MakerDAO has significantly evolved over the last several years. With so much opportunity ahead of us, @rune envisions Maker reaching its true potential by becoming a purpose-driven DAO with a compelling vision; He promotes that we can use the power of DeFi to adopt the principle of Clean Money and Sustainable Finance to help coordinate a global build-out of sustainable energy pathways for clean energy projects. The core of his Clean Money initiative consists of a tokenomics system called the Sagittarius Engine, which would replace itself as the destination of Maker\u2019s protocol surplus and provide a tangible benefit to MKR holders who lock up their MKR into governance for long term periods. Much more information and deeper discussion are found in the post. The DAO needs a serious discussion about legal structure - MakerDAO currently has no legal structure registered in any jurisdiction, and Maker is very likely to be classified as a general partnership within the United States, which can lead to multiple risks for the DAO and any individual member of the organization.  In response, @PaperImperium urges that we find solutions to these problems as soon as possible. He offers some solutions in the post but promotes serious discussion on the subject. Suggestions for Multiply Oasis interface - Maker has a new Multiply function for Oasis which allows vaults to leverage in one step. @chonghe states that the UX is not user-friendly. @Frank_Brinkkemper from Oasis.app responds by addressing the problem and clarifies their plan to fix it. Is Maker Dao decentralized at all? - @sasa asks the community why Maker decided to give MKR to a few people during inception even though there was no ICO. He believes that MKR distribution is very concentrated and can no longer be minted. Proposal: Market Making Proposal from Wintermute Trading - @YM_Wintermute submitted a proposal to provide market-making services to MakerDAO. The proposal involves loaning 10,000 MKR to Wintermute Trading, who will either return the loan in full or provide 50 million USDC, representing a 100% premium to the current price. You can watch their introduction to this proposal on last week\u2019s Governance and Risk Call. Fixing the par value of the stablecoins - In response to the FEI PSM proposal, @SebVentures is asking the communities opinion on setting at least one of the tin/tout of the PSM to 0% to achieve a 1:1 peg to allow other stablecoin protocols to provide a PSM-like facility with this 1:1 without having to deal with centralized stablecoins directly.  Ongoing Discussions:  \u2018Who said discussions should end after a week!?\u2019 Self Insurance Fund - @layerzero from Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit introduces SES Legal used for legal and regulatory topics and initiatives. He also announces their Self Insurance Fund, which will cover legal costs, economic damages to third parties and can be used as a legal reserve for obtaining a legal opinion or advice. Much more information can be found in the post.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Turn off burner, fuel up Sagittarius Engine - In reaction to @rune\u2019s post, Planet_X signals to turn off the Buy and Burn, keep the surplus buffer at 60 million DAI, and direct excess funds of the Surplus Buffer to the Sagittarius Engine.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community. Check out this thread for more posts related to delegation. Where to Find Opportunities at MakerDAO - Looking for job opportunities at MakerDAO? Perfect! @Davidutro set up a thread containing resources to help find available job listing and hiring practices. If anybody has additional information on unique hiring practices or job listings, please comment on the thread. Seeking community members interested in podcasting - @Content Production Core Unit Team is seeking blockchain, DeFi, and MakerDAO enthusiasts who are interested in hosting podcasts featuring different types of content on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis.  Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects! - @juan sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that want to present?
