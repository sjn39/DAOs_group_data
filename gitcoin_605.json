You can also count on my for the Onboarding Specialists as it\u2019s my pleasure to bring new people into Gitcoin DAO. It\u2019s a natural role for me as I already briefed a lot of folks on what we\u2019re collectively working at in the FDD, MMM and Moonshot collective streams and directed them to the DAO onboarding procedures afterwards. I talked with Armand yesterday and he asked if I could help out with the Onboardings. I already told him I would.  PS. If I take on a Full time position in Project Management - DAO Operations I am worried that I could not contribute to my full capabilities  in the Policy, Grant Reviews and Research Squads thus my impact will diminish to an extent over there.
