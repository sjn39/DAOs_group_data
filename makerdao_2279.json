I think we can already do a lot just with the surplus buffer. If we collect lots of DAI into the surplus buffer during times of positive sentiment then we\u2019ll have plenty of DAI available to initiate flap auctions on the next downturn. If we\u2019re going to add capabilities to the protocol then it would be cool if the protocol could place limit orders in the MKR/DAI order book. Using the surplus buffer, we could place limit buy orders at the bottom of the range and limit sell orders at some crazy high P/E ratio (100-200). ",

                    "content": "This is maybe not the best idea Here is why:  Centralized stablecoins are very much a either/or affair. They either hold the peg or, if trust is lost, deviate strongly from their intended value. If Maker is to act as an arbitrage party it means doubling up on risk. Maker will use both (example) generic stablecoin USDX as collateral, and hold and trade USDX to maintain DAI/USDX. This results in a doubling of the risk Maker makes by onboarding a stablecoin. As the number of added stablecoins grow (more USDs, EURs, gold etc) maintaining bots and pegs is going to be a huge operation in itself adding significant risk to the Maker system.  Example: Maker onboards USDX. USDX starts slipping, resulting in DAI/USDX moving out of tolerance. Maker bot steps in, sells DAI and buys USDX in order to maintain peg. USDX is however a scammy shitcoin and drops to zero after it is revealed USDX was invented by Vladimir Putin. Maker is now stuck with both the USDX bag + any losses from CDPs similar to the Black Thursday event. ",

Maker is now stuck with both the USDX bag + any losses from CDPs similar to the Black Thursday event.   This threat can be lowered by having a ceiling for the amount of DAI that can be minted and by having several types of centralized stable coins reservoirs in this scenario, if the drop in USDX was sudden then the vaults will also have the same issue if it is gradual then  we can have auctions kick in for the contents of the Reservoirs same as in vaults the risk of using centralized stable coins will exist whether we used Vaults or Reservoirs but better liquidity, a new stream of income are the benefits of Reservoirs ",

                    "content": "Yeah, this adds a risk to maker. It\u2019s the difference between 100% collateralization and being over collateralized. If you\u2019re worried about Maker not making enough profit, you could propose to raise the sf on stablecoins. There\u2019s sort of an issue with trying to set up big sell and buy walls and trying to control the price. You can just end up with big exposure to stablecoins. Also, where are we getting the capital to buy DAI and prop up the peg? Also, talking about liquidations. That\u2019s going to be problematic, you\u2019re going to take a loss, cause more pressure on the peg in the wrong direction. Basically this is a vault with a 100% collateralization ratio and a 2% origination fee. You have no buffer for liquidations. Interesting idea though to add origination fees to stablecoin vaults instead of a high SF. ",

A vault with:  100% collateralization ratio 0% stability fee / interest rate 2% origination fee (accrued to the protocol) 2% closing fee (accrued to the protocol) and anybody can close your vault if they pay the closing fee  Correct, no buffer for liquidations.
