                    "content": "This first section is a bit of a preamble MakerDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as it stands today relies heavily on a centralized organization called the Maker Foundation. In order for MakerDAO to realize itself the organization must create transparent and decentralized functions to support its existence, necessary components include worker and treasury management. Intuitively it does not make sense to expect the foundation to create these frameworks. To create decentralization we must design tools and frameworks that render the foundation irrelevant (but maybe hope they build them ;)). Right now we have three or four major teams and a couple proposed. Risk, Governance facilitator, technical and oracle team. A validation team has been proposed to offer reports, support and dissent for other teams work and the system as a whole. And a collateral coordinator may also be a necessary position (more on that will come soonish). The ultimate goal is to create a framework to review, accept, compensate and validate these teams and future ones, outside of any support from the maker foundation. Each teams mandate was ratified by a governance poll. Rich Brown as interim governance facilitator, Nik k as interim oracle team and Cryrus ( and Vishesh + others?) as interim risk team. In order to bootstrap these roles the Maker foundation compensates and supports the individuals work. Considering MCD as the real birth of the financial aspect of the protocol, the state of decentralized management accompanying it is disproportionately underdeveloped. The (majority) members of these teams work for the foundation, so while formal mandates are a positive step towards transparency and decentralization, little functional difference emerges from a foundation control standpoint (not that they are arguing otherwise). The future of the DAO depends on our ability to evolve beyond these concerns. While more pressing issues might exist, picking up the slack regarding worker compensation-relations confers more legitimacy as a DAO and resilience to regulation. What would happen if the foundation and its operations experienced extreme disruption from some authority. What would happen to the protocol? (I know its on ethereum and whatnot, but what happens if all these business, marketing and technical development teams paid by the foundation all suddenly ceased operation?) The recent announcement of the Dai Foundation was a little hard to understand at first, but probably a good move covering against malicious actors attacking the protocol through symbol usage. Here are some of the questions I see as necessary to formulate a resilient decentralized worker-operations framework. APPLICATION AND RECRUITMENT Recruitment  Who does the recruiting?  Could existing workers get bonuses for successfully recruiting somehow that stays employed for some time   An advantage is that people who work in their industry (weather, risk, legal, technical, logistics) likely know others that have adequate skills.  Some social bias I guess   Reduces voter fatigue if current team heads facilitate the recruitment  Reduces control mth have on the individual worker    To avoid social bias in recruitment , an application process could allow interested and qualified parties to apply. Fairly basic/normal list of qualifications would be applied. Would we want people to apply as teams or individuals applying to pre existing teams? I\u2019m thinking it would make sense if only team heads applied Thinking about how an application system would work with our current voting system (considering the foundation has over 100 employees I believe) manifests a headache. Personally I see recruitment by domain teams as the most sense. Their expertise and social networks likely have access to the individuals we would want. A finders fee could be paid to a risk team or individual that successfully recruits a new member (once that new member starts making contributions). In a recruitment scenario, the heads of each team however should still be voted in by MTH. Just like we have now. If a head decides to leave they can propose a replacement (likely from within the team) or people of maker can reach into their circles to find someone suitable. COMPENSATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY   What is fair compensation for each team?  10 months ago I wrote about this issue after a governance meeting https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/acm2dh/reflections_on_governance_meeting_jan_3/ . In that post I considered more competitive incentives. Rune commented proposing a framework more similar to academia. Comparing working for makerdao as a public service he also mentioned that looking at how researchers at universities are compensated as a potential model. Interesting (almost philosophical) question about how we want to compensate in general  From what I see their are not specific incentive structures for research scientists in the public sector. Salaries seem to range from 40k-100k depending on experience. For more information on research scientists salaries and feelings: https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7621/full/nj7621-573a.html       Would individual teams be better compensated for \u201cbetter\u201d performance? What is better performance?   How to negotiate terms and pay?  For the domain team member compensation would negotiated with the team head. If a workers work is short term maybe be better off as a lump sum.Potentially different in different situations For the Domain team head I think we would need a bit more sophisticated incentive structure.  Maybe a monthly salary with yearly raises \u201cStability\u201d bonus for keeping things \u201cstable\u201d \u201cGrowth\u201d bonus for demonstrated enhancement of the protocol      Part of compensation paid in mkr, giving workers more voting rights over time and another monetary incentive?  Domain heads will need to specify an address for compensation, not sure how changing the address could occur (in the case of compromised keys)    How do maker holders hold workers accountable? Who conducts the \u2018performance\u2019 reviews and how?  Domain team head can cut out work of a team member and revoke whatever access they previously had I\u2019m thinking we need a procedure for MTH to call for a review of a domain team head. Maybe this would occur after some botched operations or something else.  If we have an operational treasury I think MTH would just vote to cancel the contract, thus ending payment from the treasury      BUDGET/TREASURY Here are the questions I don\u2019t have solutions. All I think is that we really need to start specifying how Maker will control its finances post foundation. This is a prerequisite for compensation of domain teams.  When are we going to seriously consider a treasury under the control of maker holders?  This is obviously imperative for compensating various teams and viability of the DAO in general. How does the DAO have budget awareness?   Who monitors expenses, assets and liabilities?  Will we try to keep them private or public?   How do token holders ensure an effective strategy for employing revenue?  Do we need to get some accountants?   Why shouldn\u2019t the DAO take out safe CDPs for financing?  Should we invest in tokens and maintain cdps of various collateral types?    What sort of smart contract capability is necessary for these ideas. Development has to start at some point. What best ensures the fininacle future of the DAO? In general I suspect MTH will allocate budgets to domain heads who determine how to best use those funds. A report on how the funds were used should happen every so often. FLEXIBILITY Unforeseen circumstances can reduce or eliminate an individual\u2019s ability to do work for Maker. How should governance structure agreements and prepare for these eventualities? This is a broader question that\u2019s definitely being discussed in other contexts, but especially pertains to managing people since they can be kinda wild. DISPUTES How do we settle disputes? What will be the first big governance split? Aragon is working on their decentralized court system based on various economic incentives. https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court Anyone know of other possibilities? Heres an except from the github: Aragon Court handles subjective disputes that cannot be solved by smart contracts. For this, it employs jurors that need to stake a token to the Court which allows them to get drafted to adjudicate disputes, that can earn them fees. The more tokens a juror has activated, the higher the chance to get drafted and earn more fees. \"Aragon Court attempts to find what the subjective truth is with a Schelling game. Jurors are asked to vote on the ruling that they think their fellow jurors are more likely to vote on. To incentivize consensus, jurors that don\u2019t vote on the consensus ruling have some tokens slashed. Jurors that vote with the consensus ruling are rewarded with ruling fees and juror tokens from the jurors that voted for a minority ruling. A design goal of the mechanism is to require very few jurors to adjudicate a dispute and produce a ruling. A small number of jurors is adjudicated by default to a dispute, and their ruling can be appealed in multiple rounds of appeals.\" It unclear whether Maker needs this sort of mechanism. I haven\u2019t heard much talk of it in the community, but I know the team is well aware of Aragon. It doesn\u2019t hurt to bring this up again. Disputes occur, and some will likely challenge the legitimacy of an executive outcome at some point. How will we deal with those disputes externally from the voting protocol. I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. Sorrry if I was roundabout. Basically all I am doing is pointing out that to be a DAO we need to control the finances and obligations to workers that power the protocol. Implicit in this is a recognition that translating between various national communities is essential in creating a more diverse and skilled pool of talent. ",

Actually creating a treasury (even if it is used by the Maker Foundation) Consider creating DAO treasurer position.  When it comes to positions a few DAOs I am aware of are at least 2 - 3 people deep in them and most real decentralized companies have a primary position, then an assistant, then kind of an assistant in training.    Often times these DAOs are required to run 24/7 and have staff available at all times so they can tend to get a bit deeper in these positions.    Even so if a person gets sick or can\u2019t continue as the primary head of a company position then quite often there assistant stands in as an interm person to handle the primary responsibilities and authorities associated with the position. In the loosest sense the DAO still has well defined positions - and they do elect or have by appointment (depends on how the DAO operates in terms of governance) people who assume those responsibilities and powers even if it is temporary.   The idea of a community running all the details of a CEO, CIO, CTO, etc. doesn\u2019t really work that well in practice, but having a governance structure where people can line up in position (as in training, assistant(s), etc.) provides for a model where there is a well defined organizational structure with authorities and responsibities but that anyone within the DAO can move into any position. I\u2019ll have to look for examples because I know I was researching this a long time ago and found a few DAO type companies even then.    I remember reading that these types of companies were well positioned to compete because of the benefits of the DAO model vs. the typical centralized corporate model.   BUT there were significant legal as well as operational issues that needed to be hurdled before such organizations were to become ubiquitious.    The DAO model was good for a product that did not have to have manufacturing facilities - hence perfect for software, or for charitable activies, etc.   Think tanks, whatever.   Any business type that required real facilities vs. virtual would likely face more challenges than the others discussed above. All in all great post.   We probably have to break this down into bite sized reasonable steps but the idea of defining those steps as well as trying to imagine an end goal target to achieve would be useful.   I will have to mull on this a bit more and see if I can dig up my old research on the topic. ",

Regarding budget spend for building improvements\u2026I could see such requests being vetted either through this forum or a more formal manner e.g. EIPs where timelines, resources and costs are transparently agreed upon just like technical aspects of formal verification, and development could be based upon integration with a service like Sablier to ensure iterative build and delivery. Further hypothesising about a future state, I would expect some revenue generating groups to form - for example trading desks that run bots, and similarly, cost centres devoted to server upkeep or website management. Would a treasury function sit across these groups or could there be a smart contract relationship between the now independent internal/external groups due to mutual interests\u2026perhaps the treasurer is voted in by Governance for a year - definitely keen to see what your research reveals, MakerMan.

The other signaling request post purely asks about formation a treasury and dosent ask about access or any other detail yet.     MakerRof:  The people most financially invested in the long term success of makerdao are those who hold the largest amounts of MKR tokens, so they will be the ones most incentivized to fulfill the necessary roles by employing the appropriate people to assist the project or fulfill these roles themselves with their own resources.   Yeah hows that working out? In that logic large holders would pay oracle fees too, but they dont. What your suggesting is a more centralized process compared to large holders actually going through a governance process to incentivise work. You also imply that makerdao would have more social bias than large holders. Why is that justified?     MakerRof:  A decentralized protocol will probably not stay decentralized if there are people who are able to control parts of it.   People have to do work at some point for maker to make, but even then nothing in my thoughts implies more control over the protocol for employees. The process would be controlled by governance (ak large mkr holders). An accountant/treasury position would only have control of the treasury if mkr holders wanted them too (which I severely doubt they would). Their job would be to recommend budgets and other financial tools to maximize the effectiveness of revenue. We simply must figure out a way to incentive the work we want done. Right now the foundation control that completely. How could employment from the DAO be considered more centralized or adversarial to large holders?     MakerRof:  There are no real solutions to the removal of these biases therefore the intended future effect of this proposal is unknown but most likely it will weaken the future further decentralization of the makerdao protocol. It has the potential to centralize the power of the administrative group to the disadvantage of other stakeholders.   I dont see a clear justification for this point. The foundation controlling workers is a non speculative centralized aspect of the system; open to attack from regulators.  I am working on trying to push employment to the DAO which would promote transparency in roles, pay and performance. Why would transparency weaken decentralization? ",

And I find myself agreeing with Mitote here. If any large MKR Holders wanted to fund risk teams, development teams, etc, they are currently able to do this. As was pointed out, we haven\u2019t see this happen yet, and frankly due to the diffusion of responsibility across token holders, I\u2019m not sure that we ever will. However, if we do see this happen, great the more people working on the system the better! The employment of individuals using DAO funds doesn\u2019t prevent this from happening. ",

No system is perfect, which is why checks and balances will still be needed as you pointed out. The determination of the risk team, even if public can have unexpected outcomes, simply because they are the incumbent governing authority. We can\u2019t assume non risk specialists understand everything they\u2019re doing. Even now, US pension funds are investing in unaudited Chinese companies. Lastly, if the existing resources within makerdao continue to do their functions, there is no incentive for large stakeholders to step in. A reasonable suggestion would be to ask known large stakeholders to employ human resources to protect their own investments. This should ensure better alignment of stakeholder interests with administrative functions, minimizes the risk of social and bribery attacks by maximizing accountability to the stakeholder via direct accountability.

MakerRof:  We can\u2019t assume non risk specialists understand everything they\u2019re doing.   I agree, I made a post suggesting that we employ community validation teams for this very reason. There are multiple solutions to this problem. However, I am not convinced that having the risk teams directly employed by a large MKR Holder is one of them, because:  They are still subject to bribery. They are reporting to a single Entity there is less chance that their output will be validated by multiple entities.      MakerRof:  Lastly, if the existing resources within makerdao continue to do their functions, there is no incentive for large stakeholders to step in.   You are arguing against your own point here. The key point of your argument is that it is better for large MKR Holders if they fund their own risk teams (safer for the project, less risk of bribery, accountability etc.) Either:  It is better, and large MKR Holders have an incentive to do this. It is not better, and they don\u2019t have an incentive to do this. It is better, but they all have the incentive to let a different large holder do this (This is the diffusion of responsibility problem I mentioned earlier).  Imo, it\u2019s option 3, which is why we need to setup a system in which these positions are funded by all MKR Holders (ie funded by the stability fee income) ",

They were a functioning team that already held ETH prior to that. EF funded all the other teams but they funded MULTIPLE such teams. They did not fund only one. And then those teams employed people to do the work. Those employees were then answerable to their own teams. Arguably, makerdao should give grants to various Risk teams to do the work under the EF model. ",
