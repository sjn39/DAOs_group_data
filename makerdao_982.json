My question is very simple: Suppose I want to buy a small business, and I have a pile of money well more than big enough to buy it. I want to be smart with my money, so instead of paying cash for the business I am considering buying crypto assets and borrowing against them. Maker is built for this purpose (if I\u2019m not mistaken), but I don\u2019t want to commit all of my available cash in case it goes sideways. There is a cost associated with the service, so in order for it to be profitable for me there must be, I imagine, some minimum amount I need to put in. If that amount is more than my pile of cash then it wouldn\u2019t seem to make sense for me to pursue this course of action, at least in my mind. But what is that amount? Is it the dust limit? Is it more than that? If I\u2019m to calculate it for myself, what factors do I need to consider\u2013and where might I find those data? ",

You would need to multiply that amount by the liquidation ratio to get your minimum collateral. Though keep in mind that if the value of the collateral dropped at all you would be liquidated, so in reality the minimum supply amount would be higher, unless you plan to leverage up your position using the borrowed DAI.
