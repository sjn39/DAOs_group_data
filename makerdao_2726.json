A possible solution is a new, additional Flop mechanism that auctions off not MKR, but a vesting contract paying MKR over a time period. I think this would incentivize hodlers to buy them at a discount, but maybe at less of a discount than a MKR Flop. I am not proposing it, I want to know why people think this is a good idea or not, and worthy of development resources or not. ",
