Today we\u2019ve got a couple of cool presentations coming at us: Juan\u2019s gonna kick us off with the Core Unit Operating Model; that is the MIP Set he proposed with help from @iammeeoh and @flipflopflapdelegate. Looking forward to that. Afterwards, Dennis is gonna give a quick presentation on some kind of accounting backend stuff that can be applied to that. For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.

Just because you\u2019re in the Risk Core Unit, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t help out with Oracles or what have you  Example of a Core Unit1920\u00d71080 168 KB  28:00 \u2014 Derek: I\u2019ve been focusing on the Smart Contract Team recently. We have a lot of gas costs. Should I be breaking that out as some sort of an estimate over a period of time or would that be too much detail?   30:44 \u2014 David Utrobin: What happens in the event of a budget deficit, if the team underestimated how much they need?   33:09 \u2014 Free discussion around budgets and price volatility  Next Steps1920\u00d71080 182 KB  36:05 \u2014 Greg Di Prisco: Something I don\u2019t understand is what happens if you have a Facilitator that spins up an entity to contract the DAO; this Facilitator through this entity then signs other contrats with other service providers and then is voted out as Facilitator. What happens to all of those contracts?   40:50 \u2014 Adri\u00e1n Rivero: A Facilitator can contract a company and this company should do an invoice for the service it\u2019s creating. Right now, if a Facilitator contracts somebody else, , probably that person could invoice the Foundation. Is that contemplated in this structure? How would that work?

Does it change from country to country? 58:05 \u2014 Marina: If the person is so remote that they\u2019re on a different continent, why would you ever hire them as an employee instead of as a consultant?

If the governance domain wants to (?) US$20 on suscription, is that something you can provide or does it need to be a larger amount? MIP Set1920\u00d71080 137 KB Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro  I\u2019m incorporating the feedback and I\u2019m expecting to republish the MIPs this week \u2013 maybe not all of them, but at least the main ones and the subproposals so that people can start working on them. If you have any comments or questions, reach out on the channel or privately. Thank you very much. It was great having you.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. He\u2019s sorry for being late.
