Specification  Motivation This Core Unit is authorized to spend $898,150 annually. Events are a \u201cnice to have\u201d and not required for this bear market, particularly considering how Daivinity was executed. Mkr token holders\u2019 money was spent on unknown attendees and no business deals or new hires have been credited to that event. Given current budget constraints, the protocol simply does not accrue value from a core unit whose mission statement is: \u201cTo provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts.\u201d And so this core unit should be granted severance and offboarded. This is part of the list of reforms I laid out here for @rune and plan to pursue.  Core Unit ID EVENTS-001  Budget Implementation On this proposal\u2019s approval: No more Dai will be transferred for the use of this Core Unit, either through streaming or through direct payments. This does not apply to any disbursement included in the Golden Parachute section.  Golden Parachute  Breakdown The suggested offboarding compensation (excluding spend on more events) from this Core Unit was the following:     Item Cost     Legal & Accounting $15,000   Saleries and Compensation $88,336   Total $103,336     Implementation Upon the approval of this offboarding subproposal, a transfer will be made of 103,336 DAI to a wallet or wallets publicly communicated to GovAlpha by the facilitator, @PonJerry ",

The new CU hasn\u2019t had a chance to organise a single event or really get going before this proposal would offboard them. As a general comment, Maker has to be careful about these 180-degree turnarounds in governance - also see this example just from yesterday. If that becomes a pattern, we\u2019ll struggle to hold onto talented staff or any prospective CU as they will (quite reasonably) not want to make a career shift for a protocol that might change its mind a month later and fire them. There\u2019s a balance here to be struck between financial diligence and trustworthy governance. ",

I think my reply would be that 1. generous severance is included, and 2. the manner in which this core unit was pushed upon the DAO was not exactly a standard onboarding. You had a protocol engineer asking colleagues for money from their budgets to put down on a party that was unapproved, and only after was there a \u201capprove more money or we\u2019ll lose the deposit\u201d special purpose fund, and then there was this large budget. I\u2019m sure these folks are great event planners. But they refused to even collect a list of attendees (or if they did, they did not report it to the DAO) as several delegates asked them to do. I don\u2019t want to be uncharitable, but this was a core unit that was onboarded by a friend who was a trusted member of the community and there has also been a significant market, budget, and Mkr distribution shift since onboarding. I think it\u2019s the most obvious place to cut the budget without harming users. Parties don\u2019t help users of the protocol at all. ",

There are other options to be explored before like flexible budgets, salaries, and events. This CU should exist as events are a major way to create awareness and gain customers, so why not propose more transparency or a temporary pause instead, if budget use is your concern. Also, isn\u2019t now the time to show the crypto world that DAI is still here, still strong and showcase its market position as the best crypto stablecoin. During uncertain times, people tend to flight to safety, so this could be an opportunity to educate newcomers about DAI and for others that were burnt in the UST collapse to find a home. ",

                    "content": "The feedback was regarding the structure of the core unit, arrangement, and business needs prior to ratification (see below). The issue is that the core unit proposal failed to adequately identify the business needs of Maker along with a budget to meet them. When I say unfortunate, I mean just that. To be clear, Onboarding and then promptly offboarding CU is not okay. It sends the wrong message internally and to our counterparties. Our goal should always be to have successful relationships and to avoid conflict and failure. Conflict and failure mean wasted energy and negative sentiment all around. The due diligence efforts on your initial thread were not just to protect MakerDAO but also the Events CU and staff. Due diligence establishes mutual expectations and helps avoid 180 degree reversals through a well informed and thoughtful analysis. Once a strong and defensible case is made, both sides are protected through understanding. Moving Forward. The appropriate ask by the community could be instead a request to fulfill the original MIP analysis, rather than just offboard the core unit,  the community could ask events to establish a clear strategy and roadmap for what you will actually produce, how it fits into the brand and marketing strategy, and what it would cost. Events could ask for the community to meet them there rather than a complete removal of staff. Another option is to migrate a portion this budget to subcontract through another CU, etc. This would still require similar planning above and a statement of work. Regardless, taking the time now in planning and setting expectations will help avoid misunderstanding in the future. This preparation is to the benefit of every stakeholder.  Prior Feedback and Concern: March 9, 2022    MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)   It seems a bit unorthodox to hire two people full time to do events. Not saying it isn\u2019t a lot of work, simply that, the usual arrangement would be an outside contractor managed by existing CU/ CU budget or a SPF fund. Note, this is the exact structure we see above and used to great success. This approach is a better fit, has more appropriate costs and does not burden the DAO with ongoing obligations. Why fix something that isn\u2019t broken? Core units come with obligations. We just saw the headache of offboarding a core unit, let\u2019s be pragmatic in reviewing core units. Core units are one tool in our toolbox. No need to use a hammer on a screw when we have a screwdriver.   March 10, 2022    MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)   Stick with what works and be positive. We have already seen positive results at a generous and practical spend from your proposed team. It does not make sense for Maker and MKR holders to lock in two full time employees on top of these production budgets. Maker does not yet know its own demand for events. Moving forward, I would suggest continuing to use the SPF framework collaborating with other CU as you have been to great success. There is no evident business case under which this core unit proposal makes sense, especially when considering both the underlying economics and the actual present needs of MakerDAO. Your best bet to succeed is not to ride one early success, but instead to build a track record as a long term, reliable partner of the DAO.   March 11, 2022    MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)   Moving forward. If I were in your place, and I was attached to being a core unit, I would prepare the following proposal:  Identify MakerDAO\u2019s actual events needs (qualitative interviews and quantitative figures from core units, including establishing an actual need from the CU roadmaps, get CU budget commitments on long term spend, etc.); Identify how you could pragmatically meet these needs, what it would take, staff, events, etc, not blank check ceilings and guesstimates; Produce honest and objective market review of comparables to produce similar events from other providers Perform a critical but objective review of the competing proposals. Present a clear over under of your proposal versus competitors as well as the cost benefit in quality, service, etc. Regardless of whether the cost is over/under, describe what MakerDAO gains and loses from your services. Clearly define and acknowledge the cons of your proposal and downsides to the DAO. Prepare a budget that fairly meets MakerDAOs needs based on the above analysis and explains how it may also afford the flexibility a DAO requires.   Business needs come first. If you do the above, it will be a fair deal that naturally makes sense to ratify. You will not need to convince people or be constantly changing numbers, arguing about numbers. The case will be made objectively and factually. As it stands, the main issue is that this proposal has not really demonstrated a need for the products as described. Nobody on this thread has been able to make a clear case for the value of the product (parties) against the significant spend (~$1mm). It seems what is missing may be a fundamental understanding of MakerDAO business needs as well as an acknowledgement of the present market climate.   ",

Existing CU spend, offboarding costs and budget reduction initiatives must be presented and considered before actual off-boarding savings can be evaluated.

They were mostly distributed through Maker contributors/CU members and Twitter.  There is no charge for the tickets.     Ippy:   How many attendees were at the previous Daivinity event? (NB: This is a count at the door, not just tickets given out)    Denver- ~850 Amsterdam- ~400 Attendance targets for events can be found in our CU proposal.  These days there is more demand than available capacity.  Amsterdam we had to turn many away as it was a smaller event.     Ippy:   Do we know who they were? If so, who has that list?    No specific list. but from seeing and talking to who was there it mostly consists of industry professionals.  So employees from Maker and other protocols such as Aave, TrueFi, 1 Inch, Optimism, Compound\u2026etc you name the protocal and they were most likely there.  Industry professional is the target.  We directly distribute tickets to all the main protocols so we generally know which protocols are in attendance.     Ippy:   Did we collect any information such as emails, phone numbers, company affiliations? If so, who will be given access to that valuable information?   Will there be any information collected on attendees (number, identity, how they acquired their tickets, contact information, whether they\u2019re the same attendees as last time, our own people or non-token holders, etc)?    The collection of information has come up a few times so let me address this. We do not collect personal information at these events as we don\u2019t see much benefit from collecting this information and doing such has us run into privacy law issues. To expand on the legal side.  If such a list of information existed we would legally not be able to share it publically or beyond our own internal use.  Since MakerDAO legally does not exist we have a legal entity for the CU.  Any information which is collected is the responsibility of our legal entity and privacy laws do not allow us to disclose this information.  Even to another CU as they operate under a completely separate legal entity. So collecting information and sharing publically or beyond our legal entity will not be done as this would put the CU and its members in a legally compromising position.  Which I will not do.  I hope you understand this position as we have to operate within the legal boundaries of multiple jurisdictions. But hope is not all lost.  The team will be issuing a POAP for the event.  A POAP is a way to track and engage attendees in a way that doesn\u2019t put the CU at legal risk as POAP is completely voluntary and all information is available on-chain.     Ippy:   For the upcoming event, what is the breakdown in how tickets are distributed?    Tickets are split by financial contribution for the upcoming event.  So in Makers case, there will be about 550 tickets reserved for distribution.  The other 550 will be split among our 4 partners for the event and it is up to them to distribute them as they see fit. Makers batch of tickets will be given to various parties such as Maker CU members/facilitators, community members (you just need message @Leggevents to get one), industry professionals/protocols and some reserved for a public release via Twitter (@daivinity).

Is there a limit to how many tickets one contributor or CU can secure?   Nothing specific,  CUs can reach out and request as many tickets within reason.  We have a Maker specific code we fire out so CU members who are attending the conferance can ensure they have a ticket.  The ticketing app is set up so you can only grab one ticket at a time but the code can be used \u201cx\u201d times.  Prevents people from ticket hoarding. Not sure who souced the most attendees, team effort really.     Ippy:  Do we know an actual count?   Amsterdam -374 ticket scans but there was a scanning issue at one point so probably another 30 let in without scan. Denver-  Can say the exact number.  I don\u2019t have this data this event was run more ad-hoc and ticketing wasn\u2019t done by anyone in our CU.  Was handled by others at Maker.  850 was just the number that I from talking to people.     Ippy:  Could we know what those have been/will be? Who chooses them?   Would have to do some serious digging to get all the names but in a nutshell, if they are Ethereum based and at the conference then they were at the event  Maybe not the most specific answer but it is what I can provide at the moment. Chosen by CU members from all over Maker.  We give out ticket batches to many people then they will send them out to their contacts.  Some direct requests by protocols to us. In EthCC case this will be very diverse as the other 4 partners will have their own industry invites to bring to the event. ",

It sucks, and would have been great if we had not done it in the first place or could have foreseen the big crash would have come. But that didn\u2019t happen, so now we have to go with the second best option which is to make hard choices today. And I will definitely support whatever holistic budget reduction plan is on the table, if someone makes it and it is actually convincing.

This bear market should be an opportunity to onboard many more engineers and smart contract developers, and that\u2019s also why we should be cutting budgets other places where we can.   On this regard we have only just been able to secure a budget to begin sponsoring conferences such that we get booths. And I say \u201cwe\u201d because it requires engineers/growth/events/etc to set up and run booths at conferences. Booths are the best way to get people interested and hire new talent. Previously we\u2019ve had CUs just take it upon themselves to setup booths - see Harvard Blockchain week SF just went ahead and setup a booth for a few of us on SF, PE, RWF to get some hires and it worked. Something that is not clear from the outside is Events has a workshop and are capable of building us booths for the conferences. Parties were the start, but the goal of this CU was to support all in-person activity.     rune:  Yes, although in all cases I still believe events should be merged with growth and PR. I am against a stand alone events CU, and also believe many other core units should be merged to make it less random what\u2019s a core unit and what isn\u2019t.   I agree with this, but the async nature of the budgets made this hard to achieve. Everyone is too afraid to propose budget expansions to merge CUs that make more sense to be internal. 100% Events and SHCU should be merged into Growth and PR, but they barely got an increase on their last budget. How do we go about synchronously merging these CUs into Growth and PR without a holistic process? ",

Maker has a process to both onboard and offboard core units. It\u2019s pretty much the same process in terms of time. This proposal is in its request-for-comment period (hence all the discussion here). At some date in I think early August, this will be eligible to be put up for a vote. I think the poll would be up for two weeks. If the poll is passed by MKR holders, then I expect it would be only a couple of days until defunding was executed. It\u2019s all very much the mirror of the onboarding process. Your options if opposed to this proposal are either lobby enough MKR to defeat the proposal (which seems difficult given Rune\u2019s support for it, but there\u2019s a lot of delegates with his MKR and some may be willing to oppose this proposal), or find a way to get the author to withdraw the proposal. Alternatively, the author has included a provision for a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d and has asked for input on what would be appropriate. Best of luck. I know this has got to be a terrible process to go through over such a long time period. ",

This is worry for obvious reasons. There are real people behind this MIP and there will be harsh personal consequences due to this. Members of the community want to 180 on a proposal that was passed less than two months ago, this is clear. The timing of this MIP is overwhelming unfortunate especially as we are in the most stressful/time-consuming stage of our event execution, let alone the ironic \u201cset-up\u201d administrative duties. But alas we will ABSOLUTELY deliver. Understandably cuts are needed in this climate and we have actively/successfully achieved this without guidance/suggestion. I believe we are the only CU to be doing so (other than the obvious, SFCU etc).  Please refer to our update post which highlights out current strategy for reducing cost. Give us a chance. ",

It might end up becoming third party service using Special Purpose funding of course which might make the setup more flexible but that\u2019s also up for discussion. Another concern I have is precedent. Of course, the community has a governance authority to propose separate budget cuts or even offboardings apart from overall budget adjustment proposal. However, it\u2019s preferred to give SF CU as well as the group working on it a chance to work on it. ",

For example, Brand and PR team focuses on promoting Maker and they currently spend quite big amount sponsoring different podcasts and etc. If the team believes it\u2019s more beneficial to replace some of its budget into events instead as events also promote Maker, there can be adjustments within.

                    "content": "@Recognized-Delegates  & @rune please read as there is some important financial information to consider shall this proceed. As a start, the team finds this highly disappointing to have an offboarding posted just shy of 2 months after the ratification vote for onboarding the CU.  As a new CU we think it is a reasonable ask for MKR holders to honour the ratification vote and let the team continue with their mandate.  We view onboarding a CU as a commitment by the DAO to at least see out the fiscal year (baring any fraud or poor performance).  There are real people here that have changed their lives to become FTEs of the DAO as a result of the onboarding vote.  IMO reversing course on a vote sends a poor message. We realize that everyone is very concerned with finances and the bear market.  That is understandable.  While this MIP is framed as a cost savings of 898k (The entire CU budget) this will not be the case and cost savings will be significantly lower. Explanation below. A few factors need to be looked at, such as actual CU spending by September (The earliest offboarding date) and current budget reduction. Current CU Budget The approved budget from May 2022 to May 2023 is 898,150 DAI. Budget Reduction Strategy As presented in our CU proposal one of our strategies for reducing the cost of our CU to the DAO is splitting the cost with other protocols This has so far been a success with the CU\u2019s first official upcoming event at EthCC being split with 4 other partners.  Massive credit to @leggEvents is due here as he has done great work delivering on this promise. This is the approach for all events and will generate revenue for the CU of ~213,000 DAI CU Spend by September 2022 Since the first half of our year is weighted more heavily with events (EthCC: July 19, EthWarsaw: Sept 1, DEVCON Bogota Oct 7-17) by the time an offboarding vote would conclude our estimate of CU spend is ~282,000. Note this includes 78,000 of revenue by that point (EthCC & Eth Warsaw).  Bogota will be 75% paid for as we have to book venues months in advance. This is directly due to demand and competition. The size and popularity of events coinciding with Ethereum conventions are growing making it essential to plan months in advance. Offboarding Cost/Term This is an interesting one since our budget passed before the reworked MIP40 in June, which has a section for offboarding costs and MIP4c2-SP15 (Currently in RFC).  While there is severance listed in this MIP this doesn\u2019t capture everything. While MIP4c2-SP15 is technically not approved the current process is pretty much undefined and essentially leaves a CU open to being rugged by the DAO.  But I guess we ask that MKR holders do NOT do that\u2026 From the offboarding MIP amendment and some community members\u2019 posts during content production, the suggested approach is 4 months to unwind.  So this is what we are requesting if this MIP proceeds to a vote.  So my first approach to this is directly to request @ippy to add the following to the MIP if it is to proceed. Alternatively, if this is not added to the MIP then I will raise a signal request to create a 2/3 multisig to hold these funds in the case of offboarding.  This would serve a similar way to the new budget process of offboarding costs, see MIP40c2     Item Cost     Remaining Bogota Cost $35,000   Bogota Contengency (15%of major event budget) $16,500   Legal & Accounting $15,000   Saleries and Compensation $88,336   Total $154,836    The 4-month unwind will consist of the team making the Bogota event the last event.  By offboarding, this event will be ~75 percent already paid for.  Doesn\u2019t make sense to let the costs sink.  The largest conference of the year, why would you not want everyone there talking about Maker? Also included are some legal and accounting costs.  I\u2019m probably in for one hell of an audit in the new year due to running this CU. Contingency has been listed as a return to the DAO as it currently has not been used and is not projected to be drawn from.     Item Cost/Revenue     Origional CU Budget -$898,150   Revenue from Partnerships +$213,000   Contengency +$117,150       Projected CU Spend (1 year term) -$568,000       Spend by September -$282,000   Offboarding Cost -$154,836   September Spend with Offboading Costs -$436,836       DAO COST SAVINGS by offboarding CU in September with 4 months unwind(Projected Budget+Spend+Offboading $131,164    So let\u2019s say my numbers are off by 10 percent in either direction.  Essentially by offboarding this CU the DAO is only saving 118,000 to 144,000. While it has been mentioned that this is low-hanging fruit, is it?  We think everyone knows the need to save but is the best approach blindly swinging an axe?  Budget reductions need to be looked at holistically DAO wide if you want to actually reduce operational costs.  Work with and ask questions to facilitators regarding budgeting and spending.  On our side the team has already put forth a way to reduce our budget by 37 percent With an option to further reduce if things get dire. ",

First it was Hexonaut getting other core units to put down $30k for a party. Then it was a special purpose fund to pay for that party so we wouldn\u2019t lose that $30k no one had asked to be placed as a deposit. Then there was a core unit because obviously we wanted an events unit because we\u2019d agreed to the special purpose fund. I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re in this position. It\u2019s not your fault. It is absolutely the result of certain contributors thinking back in November they could give you a trial party in Denver and then use the sunk cost fallacy on voters.

The best case for the team is that the core unit disbands and you two can go back to subcontracting through another core unit or a pre authorized SPF. That would fix the principal  issue of indefinite budget as a core unit. Also, if your team can write strong event proposals in the future with sponsorship offsets,  revenue, etc. you will be very likely to get funded, so there is little lost and much gained this route. All you have to do is clearly communicate what you are doing for the next 4 months, transparent costs, and how you will wind down. @Leggevents @PonJerry ",

Having worked with marketing and PR companies in the past, it tends to work quite differently than any kind of direct advertising (like facebook ads that have quantifiable insights  and conversions). Branding through events and other experientials is long-game. And forgive me if my assumption is incorrect, but Maker probably isn\u2019t a point of entry into crypto, so it depends much more heavily and existing customer conversion. Podcasts and all that can be integrated more with events for sure, but I think it would be myopic to classify this as low hanging fruit. Events like this have intangible benefits that simply aren\u2019t quantifiable, especially not in the short term. ",

I will say though, that @Leggevents and @PonJerry are true professionals, just from a completely different realm than crypto. Do we need to spend so much on events right now? Likely no. But, I do want to point out one thing that\u2019s often overlooked when funding events of any kind. Many projects, in some form or another, do allot a budget of some kind towards a presence at major conferences and gatherings. Many opt to spend a \u201cconservative\u201d $20-30k. On the face of it, that seems sensible, no? I argue, that spending that little is actually more wasteful. $20-30k is spent regardless, but the vast majority that attended have zero recall of which project hosted the gathering. Events tend to be so similar, that it\u2019s easy to forget that one even attended half of them. What sets DAIVinity and rAAVE apart from everything else\u2026 yes, more expensive, but at least a lasting impression was made.  $30k spent is squandered money.  No lasting impressions were made. The money never needed to be spent at all.   $80k+ spend returns value.  Nominally more expensive, but lasting impressions are made. Delivers intangible value.     Should we spend so much so often on that right now though? I think rarity makes it that much more special. ",

That outcome can still be achieved and it may be possible to arrange a transfer of staff to the outsourced provider assuming a deal can be struck.
