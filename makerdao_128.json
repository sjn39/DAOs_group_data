All CU member have incentives to extract as high of a compensation as possible and once a floor has been established, then all other CU members are expected to demand the same amount or better.   The CU members in reality are no different than NFT speculators.  Its conflicts of interest for CU member to develop their own compensation package while mkr holders couldn\u2019t critically analyze compensations compare to industrial standardads.  This needs to need to be addressed by an outside impartial HR organization to critical assess the compensations on behalf of mkr toke holders and protocols. ",

The tools exist for you, or any other MKR Holder (or indeed anyone at all) to make a proposal along these lines. If you believe strongly in this, then find an appropriate HR company and put together a proposal under MIP39 or MIP55. The  @GovAlpha-Core-Unit can help you with structure, formatting or advice on the proposal (we have time to spare for this stuff in-between our primary role of NFT speculation.) To start with, I\u2019d maybe throw up some informal polls to see if this is something the community agrees with generally. Maybe get in touch with some of the delegates. It makes sense to start with this to figure out whether it\u2019s worthwhile putting the time into a formal proposal. ",
