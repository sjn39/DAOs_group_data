We are proud to say that it is built on top of the Maker Protocol. Click to read our announcement or try out the app. We hope that the Maker community finds the Yield Protocol to be a useful addition to the Dai ecosystem. This is a beta test, but the smart contracts have been thoroughly audited and tested. We plan to move out of beta in early November, once the October 2020 maturity has successfully matured. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions, and we welcome everyone to join our community Discord. ",
