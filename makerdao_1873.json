                    "content": "Unfortunately I\u2019ve currently injured my hand and can\u2019t write too much, but I will still provide more details about key concepts that are relevant for the next stage of the pregame and metadao clustering. Fixed rates are likely going to be a key avenue for increasing the amount decentralized collateral backing Dai. It will be regulated by the Decentralized Collateral Scope. See this post for more context on scopes and how they work and relate to MetaDAOs Endgame Plan: Diagram of the Scopes and ecosystem There are two major mechanisms related to fixed rates that I\u2019m planning to propose for the decentralized collateral scope. They are partially inspired by looking into the business model for the deco protocol and its potential for acting as the specialization of a Creator Cluster - but they are of course designed to be neutral and apply to all fixed rate solutions, and also apply and benefit MetaDAOs that don\u2019t offer fixed rates related products at all. In both cases, these mechanisms only apply to Maker Core Vaults that do not support MetaDAO token yield farming. This is because the yield farming element adds too much dimensionality to make it easy to figure out how to approach fixed rates - however later on, it may also be possible to expand the decentralized collateral scope to also support more advanced, specialized mechanisms that apply to the yield farming ETHD vaults.  User retention revenue share bonus The user retention revenue share bonus is a revenue share possibility on top of the standard 25% stability fee revenue share that is available to both MetaDAO frontends and ecosystem actor frontends (like Oasis, Defisaver, instadapp etc). It is based on the observation that users that vaults that have been open for a long time without getting liquidated, typically are less likely to be liquidated. The vault duration essentially acts as a kind of primitive, measurable credit score. In order to promote MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actor frontends to attract more long term vaults, the user retention revenue share bonus provides an additional revenue share for the stability fees earned from such vaults, calculated retroactively. The parameters are 10% bonus accrued over 1 year. This means that if a user opens a vault through a MetaDAO frontend and it pays 1000 Dai in stability fees after over a period of one year, the MetaDAO gets the full 10% bonus on top of the standard 25% for the entire period, so a total of 35% in revenue share over that one year period, for a total of 350 Dai. If a user opens a vault that pays 500 Dai in stability fees over 6 months before closing, then the MetaDAO gets half of the bonus, so 5%, for a total of 30% for the 6 month period or 150 Dai. This bonus promotes the economic viability of MetaDAOs funding or incentivize fixed rates on their platform in order to lock in users for the full one year duration, since the guaranteed additional revenue share bonus can help mitigate the cost of providing the fixed rates.  Fixed Rates Module The Fixed Rates Module is a mechanism that will be regulated through the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework, and actively managed by Maker Governance Votes based on advice from Decentralized Collateral Core Units (who will evolve step by step from the current risk core unit). The Fixed Rates Module is a conceptual system that allows Maker to target a fixed rates strategy for decentralized assets, and its own vaults, by using protocols like Deco and other similar products built by fixed rates projects such as e.g. Element or Sense. The Decentralized Collateral Core Units will create a target portfolio based on data and a framework provided by the Stability and Liquidity Scope (which will balance ALM considerations holistically between both RWA Collateral and Decentralized Collateral). E.g. it may target having 10% of the total Dai supply locked into term vaults (that the user must pay to wind down early) and 5% of the total Dai supply into premium fixed rates vault (that the users can freely wind down early). This can go further by targeting different periods, e.g. 50% in 3 month duration vaults, 25% in 6 month duration vaults, and 25% in 1 year duration vaults, etc. The Fixed Rates module will provide a huge amount of additional differentitation of decentralized Maker Vaults, and increase Makers access to high quality ETH and Staked ETH based collateral, while potentially also driving more income to Maker with minimal additional risk, assuming good ALM policy.
