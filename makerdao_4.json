                    "content": "This post summarizes the results of the Brand Research interviews the Content team has conducted so far. Please get in touch with @Content-Production or reply to this post if you\u2019re interested in sharing your opinion. We\u2019ll ask whether or not you\u2019re comfortable allowing us to record the interview and use the content in marketing materials for MakerDAO and are happy to keep your responses anonymous if you prefer.  Brand Research Initial Results Of the 17 individuals that have been interviewed so far, we\u2019ve had:  9 from the U.S. 4 weren\u2019t asked or declined to answer 2 from Argentina 1 from Canada 1 from Denmark 1 from New Zealand  We ask participants to share the top three values they believe the community embraces. The word cloud below shows the results; the most commonly-cited values include Transparency (8), Decentralization (5), Community (4), and Innovation (3).  wordcloud687\u00d7603 95.2 KB  When discussing \u201cwhy MakerDAO matters,\u201d here\u2019s what we heard:  Transparency + Community - Seeing an active, inviting community makes others want to contribute.  Our community is more hospitable and isn\u2019t as exclusive as other crypto communities We have more intelligent, less \u201cdegen-ey\u201d contributors (and even our degens are pretty great. Looking at you, @aburban90!) Several women noted that other communities can be exclusive and weren\u2019t as helpful as MakerDAO when introducing themselves and asking questions. Non-crypto-natives also found MakerDAO more accessible than other crypto communities Leadership - it\u2019s cool to be working \u201cat the edge\u201d   Social good - Not just \u201cbe your own bank\u201d MakerDAO has a strong competitive advantage over other DeFi protocols in that collateral can\u2019t be forked One respondent felt we have an opportunity to reduce risks around centralization using the Core Unit model, but there\u2019s work to be done to understand and mitigate those risks.   Interpretation It\u2019s no surprise that MakerDAO has a passionate community that deeply cares about making the world a better place; unfortunately, the nuances of what it means to make the world a \u201cbetter\u201d place tend to be where we get stuck: should we help \u201cbank the unbanked\u201d or should we refrain from characterizing MakerDAO as a bank, etc. Conducting brand research gives the DAO insight into these nuances. While many respondents mentioned things like permissionlessness and decentralization, most of the focus of these conversations shifted toward discussion of our community and the strengths that come with it.  With regard to brand & messaging: During one of the recent hearings in the U.S. on the regulation of stablecoins, one of the experts brought in to speak to legislators testified that the way people talk about blockchain and cryptocurrency tends to be more aspirational than accurate. For example, the copy on makerdao.com currently says that \u201cDai can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.\u201d Roughly \u2153 of the world lacks Internet access, mobile devices, or government-issued ID, which means:  There are plenty of people who can\u2019t currently use Dai. MakerDAO comes off as ignorant to the individuals and organizations directly involved in doing things like \u201cbanking the unbanked.\u201d  Instead of trying to convince people that Dai is a \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201csmarter\u201d form of money, the Content team is interested in experimenting with messaging that emphasizes the value of community - and our community in particular - in developing a currency.  Next Steps and Poll The Content team will continue conducting interviews and reporting on the results; if you\u2019re interested in participating in our research, please get in touch with a team member or leave a comment below. If the community is interested, the Content team will come up with a few examples of what this messaging could look like and create another poll to get feedback.    Would you like to see the DAO experiment with different messaging or not and if so, does the community-oriented approach sound like a good place to start?  Yes, community-oriented messaging makes sense and we would like to see what this could look like. No, this messaging doesn\u2019t make sense but I would like to see something different from our current messaging. No, we should stick with the current messaging Abstain/Other     0 voters     ",

Dai is not the same \u201ccurrency\u201d it was last year. Over time it changes, and it\u2019s meant to change for the better into perpetuity. That\u2019s a powerful concept, if it holds true. Questions to be ready for: \u201cWhat makes the MakerDAO community equipt to do this?\u201d \u201cIf anyone can join, doesn\u2019t that mean unqualified people can come and have influence?\u201d \u201cWhat indicates that Dai is getting better over time? Is there proof?\u201d \u201cWhat is the size and composition of the active community?\u201d The decentralization of the protocol\u2019s infrastructure is one thing. Decentralization and quality of the community is another, and although those two things are growing, my prediction is that this will be what people focus on with this kind of messaging. The community are the \u201cMakers\u201d of Dai. ",
