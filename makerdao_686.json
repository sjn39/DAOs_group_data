Now, this blog says,  Stability fees paid by Maker borrowers (similar to borrowing costs), are then burned by the protocol, indirectly benefiting MKR holders by reducing the token supply.  These two seem to be contradictory. Does the stability fee get deposited to the Maker buffer or burnt to reduce MKR supply? Also, Maker buffer seems to be denominated in DAI, so how is it related to MKR getting burnt at all? ",

Developers       Stability fees accrue in Dai every second, but are only updated on chain once someone calls jug.drip. They way it works is that the Dai debt of your vault increases over time. Thus if you want to retrieve the entire collateral amount, you must pay down the principal amount + stability fees. You can read more about stability fee accumulation here and here.  The protocol accrued stability fees are directed to the surplus buffer, aka the vow. Once the surplus buffer reaches a limit set by Maker Gov\u2026     ",
