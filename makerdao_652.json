                    "content": " Objective and Scope  The objective of this post and series is to help the MakerDAO community develop and understand the costs, benefits, and options available to increase the market liquidity of DAI and/or MKR across on-chain and off-chain trading venues.   Three Major Decision Points There are three major decision points that MakerDAO will need to address before we can implement any sort of consistent and effective market liquidity strategy. These three points are: Decision 1: How does MakerDAO fund its liquidity strategy? Decision 2: What is our liquidity strategy aiming to achieve, and how? Decision 3: What tools/methods do we use to implement our liquidity strategy? This post will address the second of these: understanding what we could aim to achieve with a market liquidity strategy. This post is primarily focused on objectives and will only briefly touch on the methods, leaving the bulk of these for the final post in this series.  Three Possible Goals In the process of the conversation so far, and by considering the issue, I have identified three potential goals of any liquidity strategy. This is not to say that there aren\u2019t other valid goals, and I expect and encourage people to propose others in the responses to this post. The three goals I\u2019ve been able to identify are:  Increasing adoption of DAI on L2s, sidechains, and other L1 chains. Attempting to add DAI to the ranks of USDC and ETH as the default routing tokens for on-chain liquidity. Dampening MKR price movements and increasing ease of entry to and exit from the token.  We\u2019ll address each in turn.  Increasing Adoption of DAI on L2, Sidechain, and other L1 chains Goal Increase DAI adoption and integrations on other chains by making DAI very liquid and accessible to users and developers on those chains. Why is this useful? Increasing DAI adoption on other chains both directly and indirectly increases demand for DAI as a stable token. DAI demand is incredibly valuable to the protocol because in combination with safe and scalable collateral it converts directly into revenue and profits. Directly, users on other chains will be holding more DAI, there will be more locked up in liquidity pools and there will be more locked up in DeFi protocols on these chains. Indirectly, ensuring that DAI is a credible option for new DeFi protocols helps spread knowledge and usage of DAI to new users as a result of them using those DeFi protocols. Why is this risky? As several high-profile incidents have shown. Bridging between blockchains is not without risk. This is especially true for L1 and sidechains, but the risk can be less for layer 2 chains that derive their security from Ethereum mainnet. Regardless, all the DAI on could be lost in a bridge hack. There is potentially a reputational risk here as well. If users become accustomed to using DAI on an alternative chain and there are problems on that alternative chain they may become disillusioned with DAI specifically, rather than the chain they were using to transact in it. This is especially true with dApps that abstract away information on which chain is being used behind the scenes. Finally, any protocol-owned liquidity paired against volatile assets suffers from market risk. If one of the components decreases in value, Maker loses value. How could we go about this? At a base level, we\u2019d want to make sure that DAI liquidity was accessible for trading on relevant chains that lacked DAI liquidity. The liquidity could be provided in several ways:  Providing liquidity rewards on on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc). Using on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc) and deposited and owned directly by Maker Governance through cross-chain message passing. Using on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc) and deposited and owned indirectly by Maker Governance through a Core Unit or a specially created group or multi-sig. Using off-chain market makers that deploy capital to these pools on Maker\u2019s behalf.  Important market liquidity pairs on alternative chains include:  DAI-NATIVETOKEN (where NATIVETOKEN is the native token used on the chain. MATIC for Polygon, AVAX for Avalanche, etc.) DAI-USDC (least risky for Maker.) DAI-ETH (mainly in the case of L2 chains, but potentially also on other L1 or Sidechains.)  Potentially important alternative chains include (in rough and opinionated priority order):  L2: Arbitrum - derives security from Ethereum Mainnet, potentially part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution. L2: Optimism - derives security from Ethereum Mainnet, potentially part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution. L2: StarkNet - will derive security from Ethereum Mainnet, potentially part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution. Connection with Maker through StarkNet Core Unit. L2: zkSync - derives security from Ethereum Mainnet, potentially part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution. L2: Aztec - derives security from Ethereum Mainnet, potentially part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution. Privacy Focused. Sidechain: Polygon - Popular, is working on Ethereum L2 versions of its chain. Sidechain: GnosisChain (xDai) - Uses DAI as the native token.  Note that there are probably more important alternative chains that I\u2019ve not covered here. And take the above with a grain of salt. I\u2019ve not looked into all of these in detail. To expand, we would want to ensure that DAI was also liquid on lending venues on leading alternative chains. This could be achieved by:  Deploying the Maker protocol on these alternative chains. Deploying protocol-owned liquidity to secondary lending markets through a D3M-like mechanism. Using off-chain market makers that deploy capital to secondary lending markets on Maker\u2019s behalf.  To minimize risk, it would probably be prudent to begin these activities on L2 chains that derive their security from Ethereum mainnet, though naturally, we should require detailed risk assessments before taking any action.  Attempting to add DAI to the ranks of USDC and ETH as the default routing tokens in on-chain liquidity Goal Increase DAI demand, usage, and trading fees on DAI-LP pairs. Why is this useful? Currently, USDC and ETH hold this position by default. ETH as the native asset of Ethereum mainnet. USDC is the most commonly used and most accepted centralized stablecoin that has been launched. Successfully joining or evening replacing one or both of these would result in huge benefits for Maker and DAI. Firstly, it massively increases DAI demand, both directly and indirectly. Directly, the DAI locked up in the important \u2018key pair\u2019 liquidity pools is instant DAI demand. Indirectly, if DAI becomes one of these default routing tokens, all new projects will need to seriously consider providing or incentivizing liquidity against DAI when they launch their token(s). Secondly, it encourages DAI adoption in multiple ways. Why pay twice for on-chain swaps if you can make DAI your primary stablecoin and only pay once? What is this coin DAI that my new favorite project is providing liquidity against? etc etc. Lastly, if DAI becomes one of these pairs and trading volume increases significantly then it should attract non-mercenary liquidity from the ecosystem and/or provide an alternative income stream for Maker. Why is this risky? The risk here depends heavily on how far we want to push this strategy. At the very least, it would require us to provide liquidity against other major tokens. Pushed to its utmost, Maker could take on as much risk as it was comfortable with by pairing DAI against almost all tokens that meet a minimum bar of respectability/safety/etc. There is also some risk here with front-running bots, miner-extractable value, and other badness. This is especially true if we opt for any sort of actively managed liquidity. How could we go about this? At a base level, we\u2019d want to make sure that DAI was very liquid against the other existing major routing tokens. Primarily USDC and ETH. To extend this to the point where we would hopefully start showing tangible positive outcomes, I believe we\u2019d need to do the following:  Ensure Stable-Central Routing goes through DAI - There is lots of DAI liquidity against other centralized stablecoins. We are doing well in this area already thanks to the USDC-PSM, the Curve 3pool, and the Gelato USDC-DAI pools. Ensure Stable-Decentral Routing goes through DAI - There should be lots of DAI liquidity against other decentralized stablecoins. Ensure Volatile Routing goes through DAI - There should be lots of DAI liquidity against leading volatile tokens.  Concretely this could include the following (in rough and opinionated priority order):  Reduce the gas cost of PSM swaps if at all possible. Create a new curve pool containing DAI alongside centralized stables that are viewed as safe. IE: DAI-USDC-USDP-GUSD. Onboard curve pool mentioned above, allow insane leverage in a similar way to the Gelato Pool on UniswapV3. Purchase or incentivize liquidity on major DAI-VOLATILE pairs. Probably some or all of: ETH, wBTC, rETH, stETH. Setup a decentral stable pool that includes DAI on Curve. Contents TBC but probably some or all of LUSD, FEI, FRAX, MIM, sUSD. Onboard this pool into Maker with more-conservative risk parameters and liquidations enabled. Incentivize liquidity in this pool using DAI or MKR. Add additional PSMs for other centralized stable tokens.  Note that there are probably other options here as well.  Dampening MKR price movements and increasing ease of entry-to and exit-from MKR positions. Goal Increase MKR Liquidity across multiple venues. Why is this useful? Increasing liquidity of the MKR token helps in several ways. First, it can help reduce the volatility of the MKR Token which helps to make Maker more resilient in black swan events. It also makes it easier for current and prospective holders of the MKR token to enter and exit positions in MKR, this is valuable from a governance standpoint, as it ensures that entities without interest in the direction of governance can exit easily, and likewise makes it easier for entities that want to become more aligned to do so. There is a point of legitimacy to liquidity as well. Legitimate tokens are expected to be at least reasonably liquid. Increased liquidity should lead to more efficient price discovery. Why is this risky? Having the Maker Protocol own MKR liquidity interacts negatively with the flap, flop, and surplus buffer mechanisms. In a situation where the Maker Protocol has taken on bad debt, Maker needs DAI to offset it. However, in this situation, MKR price is likely to fall which will reduce the value of a DAI-MKR AMM liquidity pair. It would be better in this situation for the protocol to just have held the entire value of the LP position in DAI in the surplus buffer. Under other situations where Maker does not own this liquidity, these risks are smaller, but in this case, the loss falls on those users that are providing that liquidity. Either these users will see what is happening and attempt to withdraw their liquidity, or they will take a loss. How could we go about this? The options here are more or less similar to the DAI liquidity options above:  Providing liquidity rewards on on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc). Using on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc) and deposited and owned directly by Maker Governance. Using on-chain automated market-making pools (uniswap, sushiswap, clones, etc) and deposited and owned indirectly by Maker Governance through a Core Unit or a specially created group or multi-sig. Using off-chain market makers that deploy capital to these pools on Maker\u2019s behalf.  ",

                    "content": " Objective and Scope  The objective of this post and series is to help the MakerDAO community develop and understand the costs, benefits, and options available to increase the market liquidity of DAI and/or MKR across on-chain and off-chain trading venues.   Three Major Decision Points There are three major decision points that MakerDAO will need to address before we can implement any sort of consistent and effective market liquidity strategy. These three points are: Decision 1: How does MakerDAO fund its liquidity strategy? Decision 2: What is our liquidity strategy aiming to achieve, and how? Decision 3: What tools / methods do we use to implement our liquidity strategy? This first post will address the first of these. I\u2019m aware that from a purely decision-making perspective, it makes more sense to start with what we want our actual liquidity strategy to be, but that\u2019s also quite complex and I\u2019d prefer to cover funding initially.  How does MakerDAO fund its liquidity strategy? There is a finite number of ways to fund a liquidity strategy given our current resources and constraints. I will list them below and lay the pros and cons that I can identify. Note that some funding methods imply some implementation methods but we\u2019ll get to those in the following posts. If anyone can think of a funding method in addition to the four listed below, please reply in the comments and I\u2019ll be happy to add it in if it\u2019s meaningfully different from one of these.  Compromise on 100% DAI Backing What? - Mint DAI directly, use it to purchase liquidity in some form and use that liquidity to back the minted DAI. Pros:  Essentially Free - MakerDAO can mint DAI without any regard to capital. May gain value - If volatile liquidity components increase in value.  Cons:  May lose value - If volatile components of liquidity reduce in value then we lose value unless the volatile components increase in price again. May Compromise DAI Backing - If volatile components of liquidity reduce in price then there is no longer enough value to back 100% of the minted DAI. May negatively impact users confidence in DAI as money.   Use Surplus Buffer Only What? - Use the DAI in the surplus buffer only to purchase liquidity in some form. Pros:  No need to raise capital. No need to risk the backing of DAI. May gain value -  If volatile liquidity components increase in value.  Cons:  The current value of the surplus buffer doesn\u2019t get us very much liquidity at all, especially if the protocol wants to own it. May lose value - If volatile components of liquidity reduce in value then we lose value unless the volatile components increase in price again. The surplus buffer is meant to be there to protect DAI in the event of the system taking on bad debt.   Selling Treasury or Minted MKR What? - Sell MKR (minted or treasury) and use it to buy DAI or other liquidity components. Pros:  Can get us a large amount of value usable for liquidity.  Cons:  Decreases the value of MKR - Selling MKR may impact the market value negatively. May be legal or regulatory issues from selling MKR.   Borrowing Against Treasury or Minted MKR What? - Lock MKR (minted or treasury) into a secondary lending platform and borrow DAI against it. Pros:  Shouldn\u2019t impact the price of MKR on the market, because we are not selling it.  Cons:  Need to ensure that the protocol position isn\u2019t liquidated. There would need to be some plan to pay-off the borrowed DAI over time. The protocol would pay interest on the borrowed DAI. May risk the backing of DAI (depending on whether the platform we use has a D3M.) May be legal or regulatory issues from selling MKR if position is liquidated. May increase risk of governance attack.  ",

                    "content": "@LongForWisdom great to see the discussion started. My preference goes as follows:  Just take MKR from treasury and DAI from SB to pair into the UNISWAP MKR-DAI V2 LP. DAO will have to decide what conditions on MKR-DAI v2 LP vault would look like.   Once these are decided MakerDAO can use its own MKR-DAI v2 vault to mint more DAI and pair it with MKR to increase the position or borrow DAI to pay itself back. I am generally against borrowing against MKR alone since it won\u2019t improve MKR liquidity in a way that facilitates market liquidity.  Putting this into the v2 MKR-DAI LP effectively locks up DAI and MKR while providing trading liquidity of some depth in at least one market.  I would be a bit wary about allowing too much levering here. It makes some sense to do (1) above with for example 5K MKR and ~11M DAI.   Lever this up say 3x to 20K MKR and 44M DAI (88M LP worth) to borrow 33M DAI.   If I am doing my off the cuff math correctly here the CR would be 266% and if we put even a 130 LR on this MKR DAI price could drop by 75% before we would be touching our LR.   Notice in this case we will have purchased another 20K MKR at a cost of 22M (or about 1100/MKR) not including increase in LP due to fees. In the end we could just do this with minted DAI because the accounting still works out to the same but thinking about a MKR-DAI v2 LP vault from a real borrowing/loaning risk/reward perspective I think makes more sense. This proposal talks about initial funding. Over time I would like to see some amount of DAI slated for flapper to be paired with treasury MKR and dropped into this v2 LP as I see this as a much better way to reward MKR holders than just buying and burning MKR.   Build a liquidity fund anyone can sell into that will consistently buy and hold MKR/DAI which if built substantially and left alone will use its fees to consume the rest of the available liquidity all by itself. Accessing even 10% of the MKR in this contract would require a 20% MKR price increase in the LP btw.   Contrasted completely with just dropping ETH into AAVE and borrowing MKR which only costs interest*time. FYI:   Maker could use this LP as the vesting compensation since it would provide a market and the value of the LP Token changes as the sqrt(MKR priced in DAI).  So this only doubles if MKR 4x\u2019s and 1/2\u2019s if MKR drops 75%.    Will earn fees while in the vesting pipeline as well.    Given Maker is going to make a vault for this LP these people might even be allowed to borrow against their vesting LP. In short the v2 MKR-DAI LP actually fulfills @rune ideas about a governance token, that also provides a market (earning fees doing that), that can and should be able to borrow DAI at significantly reduced rates (this would especially be true if these features were accessed via LP deposited in MKR governance) ",

JustinCase:  I really wish we would have started with \u201cDecision 2: What is our liquidity strategy aiming to achieve, and how?\u201d   I think whichever way I\u2019d done these would have caused some frustration. I will note that most of the pros and cons here are common regardless of what our actual strategy is, the exception being MKR-DAI liquidity, as that case benefits from the DAO being able to mint both tokens. So far I feel like a lot of the discourse has been focused on strategy, which is understandable. But I think that discourse is suffering somewhat from a lack of understanding around the question of funding. Essentially, people have argued in favour of strategies without considering the downsides of the funding decision that would need to be made in order to implement their strategy.

These days my mind likes to wander to different methods of generating protocol assets, and I think especially here it\u2019s relevant as it gives us more options and a bigger war chest to deploy without utilizing some of the potentially compromising strategies detailed here.  The biggest issue with this alternative is again scale. If the SB is too small to meaningfully fund liquidity operations, it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019d be able to sell something at a large enough scale to have an impact.  NFFs? With that said, I think we could leverage a lot of the contributor skills present in the DAO to make a meaningfully and visually appealing NFT collections. With current OG projects at nose bleed evaluations in the NFT space, it is perhaps not so far fetched that we might be able to leverage some labor and DAI expense for millions in crypto capital. Earmarking those earning for a liquidity solution seems kinda interesting, but it\u2019s perhaps a little absurd to take on such new territory for Maker and then combine that endeavor with the liquidity effort.  Annuities? Rather than bank on the NFT hype and our ability to cash in on it, an alternative solution might be to come up with a financial product worth selling. Annuities seem particularly attractive to me due to our low cost of capital. They essentially allow us to sell the future cashflow of the protocol for tokens now. With rates much lower in the DeFi space (and crypto rates starting to fall in the CeFi space as well), maker could offer and attractive yield for customers looking for fixed income. We could essentially be selling DssVest DAI streams to the masses with a clean UI and raising the funds for liquidity initiatives now. This has the advantage of essentially being the \u201cUse the Surplus Buffer\u201d option, but we get to leverage it up, taking advantage of our cash flow and superpowers of \u201cCompromise DAI Backing\u201d without actually compromising the backing. Added bonus, if we\u2019re able to generate noticeable fees from providing liquidity, there\u2019s a chance these annuities pay for themselves.  Lots of other fun ideas bounce around my head but these are the only two I can see getting into the millions of DAI raised, which is still likely too small to have an impact alone. ",

The aim is to collectively build a shared understanding of funding and costs that will apply to most or all market liquidity strategies. The issue with objectives is that the solution space is very large, which makes it harder to discuss and evaluate in a productive way. The funding question is a smaller, easier to internalize set of information that can improve and inform individuals when we get to talking about strategies. Essentially this is taking a divide and conquer approach to the problem. If we can build a shared base of understanding around this aspect of the topic, then it may make it easier to engage with the more complex question of the cost-benefit balance to various strategies.

That is, in an emergency, the LP position would be in-effect buying MKR all the way down while we\u2019re trying to flop sell MKR to raise DAI.   This is precisely what it is designed to do buy low and sell high MKR, sells DAI when MKR price low (when markets usually need it btw) and buys DAI when MKR price high\u2026  These are exactly the properties you want for both tokens if you are Maker.   Realize MKR price drops from 2.2K to 550.  This LP spends 5.5M to buy another 5K MKR.   The LP value (should one want to allow borrow against it) is only down by 50%.    The LP sits there and will soak up 30K DAI MKR buys with as little as what 1% slippage in market price.  If we boost this 4x with 3x leverage this drops to .25%. The whole point of DAO owned liquidity is to create a market for all participants that is as deep as possible.   The market participants also include the DAO itself.  Right now we auction to get the best price.  Imagine this LP is deeper than .5% of all the MKR liquidity but more like 10-20% - it then IS the market - we can flap or flop into this 30 or 100K DAI worth at a time without any concern for moving the market at all and that we probably will always be getting the best price.  Bonus here - we earn the fees off the trades as well.     psychonaut:  This part seems crazy to me. It\u2019s bad enough that we\u2019re setting up a mechanism that will trade against flop auctions. To leverage 3x seems a step too far. Plus, we\u2019d probably need to integrate with Defi Saver to automate the vault management. It just seems like too much work and overhead.   Maker with the ability to create a MKR-DAI v2 LP vault and allow not just the DAO but others to use such a vault a key way to build liquidity.   Allow this LP to also participate in governance and you finally have a governance token that, earns return, provides a market, and governs as well.  BTW:  Maker could create a public and governance only versions of such a vault for liquidity purposes with different LR, SF, and DCs Whether to lever it up - even a little makes sense because then DAI used for flapping could simply be used to pay down the levered debt (technically very easy), or as alternative use the DAI flapped to build the LP building the borrowing capacity (technically harder).   Notice what I suggested as the 3x lever - if my math is correct - creates a vault with a LR of 266% - this is pretty conservative and like I said it would take a price drop to 550 from 2.2K on MKR before this vault hits even the 130% CR mark. Also for the price to drop to 550 in my example 20K MKR would have to be sold.   The whole point of getting this up early at lower prices is to build stronger and stronger liquidity and hence price support for larger sized sales. Maker does not have to lever this, but would be wise to do so with the MKR-DAI price so low.  It is better to lever in to LP at what you think are low prices than high ones.    Also realize as this LP gains in value (or as MKR price rises) fees are DCAing in here.  Over time this LP hoovers up both tokens. It only takes 1000000/.003 or 333M MKR volume in this contract to hoover up all MKR liquidity.  The sooner we start the sooner we roll through this volume and hoover up MKR.  This LP via fees becomes a permanent buyer of MKR with DAI. I want people to remember.   The last 10% of the MKR liquidity in this LP is ONLY available at a price ~100x current price.  This means 10% of all MKR put into this LP is for all intensive purposes burned. Last point and to stay on topic. I am still supporting funding this by taking treasury MKR and some SB DAI to fund a DAO owned Uniswap MKR-DAI v2 LP to provide market liquidity and earn fees.   The rest is ideas about how we can lever this up and make it a more useful liquidity tool generally and probably for another discussion thread. ",
