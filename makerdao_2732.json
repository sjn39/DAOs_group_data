                    "content": "We are increasing the USDC debt ceiling considerably, action that has been heavily supported by the community to take the PEG back to 1. This said, we are aware of risks this type of collateral brings to the platform. USDC legal compliance states: Without limiting the foregoing, you may not use the USDC Services if (i) you are a resident, national or agent of Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Syria or any other country to which the United States embargoes goods (\u201cRestricted Territories\u201d) Being Cuban myself, I\u2019ve suffered all kind of \u201cspecial measures\u201d whenever I want to register in any American site. I don\u2019t live in the island since many years ago, even though I am continuously annoyed by any American service I want to be part in, I should count the story of my life and demonstrate that I\u2019m a resident now of an European country (a very painful process, including sending all kind of documentations to demonstrate that I\u2019m not longer in the island). What I mean with all this is: USA really takes measures against any company which breaks their embargo rules, and they had extended these to companies outside of their country (ie. European banks which have collaborated in some moment with the island). Some time before, a good friend of mine contacted me, with the idea of provide my team to support the development of a Crypto coin which could be used by Cubans to receive remittances, to store value (since the Cubans Pesos have value nowhere else), and to handle digital exchange in the island (yes there doesn\u2019t exist internet payments, VISA and Mastercards doesn\u2019t operate in the Island at all for instance, it is a country \u201cfrozen\u201d in the time, those old cars you have seen driving in Havana talk by themselves about how frozen is the country in the time). At this moment due to the global pandemic in fact the situation in the island is worst than before. I\u2019ve really thought in cooperating to build software through my company (a Software House), and use DAI as the mean to help in the Cuban situation. This said, I\u2019m a member of MakerDAO, and MKR holder myself, and I\u2019m worried that the usage of DAI in the island could really alarm the USA government and happen what we in fact see like very low probability (since DAI usage has really the potential to grow a lot there, and this one is backed so largely by USDC, this means that \u201cindirectly\u201d Cubans would be using USDC) Am I being too pessimistic in this regard? Which is the stand of MakerDAO community in front of USA Embargo against countries (including their citizen) like Cuba, and us Cubans which suffer the \u201cbad luck\u201d of have been born in a communist country? Which is the position of the community to support the usage of DAI in Cuba even at the expense of increasing the possibility to have USDC Vaults blocked and who knows which other actions could be taken by the USA government? Really open to the discussion, thoughts and ideas in this regard. ",

BNP Paribas (big French bank) had a 9 billion fine some years ago as they used USD in Sudan, Iran and Cuba (the underlying business activity was legit). They paid the fine because they want to continue to do business in the USA. Most likely those were euro-dollars (dollars liabilities on a non US-regulated entity) meaning that DAI is almost the same. Obviously USDC is way easier to froze but I wouldn\u2019t limit the problem to USDC. That\u2019s a serious problem to consider when DAI supply > 1 billions. ",

And we are currently pushing full throttle with centralised stablecoins to fix the peg and increase DAI supply. QUESTION: assume the worst happens. The USA forces Coinbase/Circle to blacklist the USDC owned by the MakerDAO smartcontract as collateral. Then what? Is this the end of MakerDAO? Losing 200m would be a Black Thursday amplified ~40x. The same problem seems to arise with any other centralised stablecoin (currently most have roots in USA) and also USA-related RWA. What kind of protection can we envisage on this road? Surely, the Foundation has something to say on this topic? I guess they have definitely investigated the legal complications associated with RWA in the last months/years. ",

But I would like to warn about something here, I\u2019ve never seen that government to make announcements and give months to withdraw even for American citizens when it comes to their \u201cfight against the terrorism\u201d. Let\u2019s see a hypothetical scenario: Some terrorist organization manage to control 1B USDC somehow, and move all that into Maker, taking 900M DAI of collateral which makes it \u201calmost impossible\u201d for anybody else to freeze their funds. Then they conduct some unheard operation in middle east. The government could prefer to risk 5B locked in MakerDAO (assuming that\u2019s all what is locked) to \u201cdestroy the DAI being used to support the terrorism\u201d, than permit those guys running wild with all their DAI. I know this is extreme, but I would not put my hands in the fire to affirm that they\u2019ll give time for everybody to withdraw their collateral in USDC from MakerDAO under some scenarios, which I would not see \u201cimpossible\u201d given previous actions of the USA government when it comes to these matters. Not that MakerDAO should permit terrorist actions, but for me is very different our DAO taking an action, that some government self proclaimed the guard of the world taking actions for what they consider is \u201cto keep the peace\u201d. The danger is real and exist, and there is no reason neither to assume and support we\u2019ll have months to solve the issue. ",

The only way they could impact really that individual, is damaging our DAO. A \u201chypothetical but not improbable\u201d solution would be blacklisting some important USDC contracts addresses which makes impossible for the protocol to run operations in USDC, would be ways more effective, since probably that will bring DAI price at least down to all that USDC collateral (suddenly there will be that same amount of DAI not backed).

Vaults blocked will translate in the long run to unbacked DAI, but let\u2019s assume that Circle and USA government will consider this twice if it implies to freeze the money of a lot of innocent people,  then why not to put all the USDC in a common pool (it could be a Liquidity Pool) in a way that the only blocking scheme is to block whole that pool? Since you claim the USDC in that pool with a token which could be passed to different persons, then nobody can really block it (at least that all the pool be blocked, which we assume will not be done due to damaging so many people) I definitely support (and will continue supporting) the usage of USDC to keep the PEG below 1.01. If there would be tomorrow some vote to increase it further 200M, I will vote yes. But I really would like to find a solution to the risk of unbacked DAI which could appears after a blacklisting in one of these stablecoins. ",

If we start getting into blacklisting accounts then we\u2019re no better than PayPal. And no matter how much anyone says, \u201cwe\u2019ll only use it when necessary\u201d, that button simply cannot be allowed to exist. Here is why: A) If blacklisting was to be put to a vote, the United States Federal Government wouldn\u2019t accept that since there\u2019s a chance that the answer will be \u201cno\u201d and MakerDAO won\u2019t comply. This would likely be followed by the USFG unilaterally outlawing MakerDAO. We\u2019d retain our liberty, but it would make business very difficult and could potentially be the death of the system. B) If blacklisting was put in the hands of a few elected agents, then there is almost a guarantee that at some point, someone will abuse the button and potentially a lot of damage will be done before they can be stopped. We\u2019d be no better than the USFG. C) If blacklisting was put in the hands of a third party\u2013I don\u2019t know how or why we\u2019d ever do that, but if we did\u2013then the USFG could just order them to blacklist whomever they liked and at that point it could be very difficult to stop them doing that in the future. We\u2019d be no better than <insert credit card company or bank name here>. D) If blacklisting was handed over to some code\u2013again, I don\u2019t know why we\u2019d ever do this\u2013then the code will be flawed and could return either false positives or false negatives. We\u2019d be no better than YouTube.     bit:  The solution is to stop relying on stablecoins because they don\u2019t bring the peg, just problems.   The whole point of all of this\u2013cryptocurrency, smart contracts, the Internet\u2013was to get around traditional institutions censoring free trade and the free flow of knowledge. And now, it seems like people are completely unaware that the Internet (by the tenets it has been built upon) and cryptocurrency (by its nature) are borderless.

Nevertheless, people have criticized Dai for accepting collateral like USDC which could be frozen this way.  Having centralized collateral does not make Dai itself centralized especially if MKR auctions would be able to insure against the collateral being frozen.   While MKR could not insure all of USDC collateral right now if it was all frozen at the same time without warning, I do think it could insure one large CDP being frozen (e.g. if it was proven to be owned by a criminal and Circle  blacklisted it).  Hopefully we will eventually get to the point where MKR is big enough to insure against the loss of any one type of collateral, but we are not there yet today. ",
