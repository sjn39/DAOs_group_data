                    "content": "If you are uncomfortable with a large PSM, this is a possible way to limit that. If you are comfortable with a large PSM, this is probably unnecessary We\u2019ve all noticed how the PSM is filling up, and today is now the single largest vault class in the Maker Protocol. The PSM\u2019s main function at the moment is to inflate DAI supply by the process of arbitrage with USDC. I propose we need to think about new ways to purposefully debase DAI so that price stability in terms of $1 = 1 DAI is maintained. DAI are, ultimately, debt that is either issued by Maker (via RWA or PSM) or guaranteed by Maker on behalf of private individuals (who use the standard vault classes). This debt (DAI) is consistently trading above face value in the markets. Thus far, the rather simple and elegant answer to this was the USDC PSM. I do not find a large PSM troubling, but many do. I propose that we consider when USDC is above a certain threshold \u2013 perhaps 3 billion or even higher \u2013 we have a new ilk for MKR that is authorized to flap. Instead of burning this MKR, it will be held in the vault. From an accounting standpoint, this is just changing our capital structure by retiring equity through the issuance of debt. It also leaves something that the DAI is minted against. This does come with some uncomfortable optics, namely that the (probably not correctly named) SB could be negative if done in extremely large amounts. That is as designed. It does not mean Maker is bankrupt or cannot cover its expenses. It means that we hold more debt than cash reserves, which is not unusual. Note that this is not primarily to finance expenditures or even buying back MKR. It is only done to maintain the peg, and in this case reduce exposure to a single counterparty (Circle). The reason this would be done with MKR is to limit the distortions to prices of other assets that are not themselves expressly pegged to the dollar, or may be improperly propped up themselves by another PSM. Also, by doing it with MKR, and with what is effectively zero-coupon debt (DAI), we are mostly just moving things around internally, without in real time altering the value of Maker Protocol in aggregate. This is because the E in the core accounting equation is simply being reduced buy the exact same amount as L is growing: Assets = Liabilities + Equity If L grows by 1 DAI, but E shrinks by 1 DAI, then the net value of Maker Protocol\u2019s assets has not changed. Do note that regardless of how you feel about this particular proposal, debasing DAI is what is necessary to keep the peg maintained. We already do this every day through the PSM\u2019s operation. This is merely a different way to do that so there is another tool in the box besides the PSM. It makes a lot of financial sense in general, and also reduces (or slows down growth of) exposure to USDC. There is more thought that would need to go into the technical execution \u2013 perhaps a new ilk isn\u2019t the best choice \u2013 and there are several aspects that may be uncomfortable to on a philosophical level (negative SB possibility without minting, accepting MKR as a kind of \u201ccollateral\u201d). But we need to think about the most harmless ways to diminish the deflationary pressures on DAI.    Should We Introduce A \u201cMKR-PSM\u201d As A Way To Ease Pressure On The Peg?  Yes. We need more than one way to increase inflation to maintain the peg No. USDC-PSM and any future stablecoin PSMs will provide enough inflation to maintain the peg Abstain     0 voters     ",

If MakerDAO has this new mechanism to mint Dai, it has no effect unless used. What would MakerDAO do if it could mint Dai like this\u2026? When a vault or PSM user mints Dai, it is theirs, permissionless, they can do anything with it. Dai gets in the hands of someone who probably has an intended use for it. It is useful Dai. But MakerDAO\u2026 would would the DAO do with this Dai? Just give it to\u2026 someone? Who? The only sensible thing to do with it is just keep it\u2026 add to the system surplus.

I imagine there are many technical constraints, specifically those related to ES. I also think PSM wording might be incorrect here. But in general flapping newly minted DAI and buying MKR on the open market means that part of DAI gets backed by future Maker net cashflows. So capital structure changes for existing MKR holders: circulating MKR supply becomes deflationary when flapping and back inflationary at ES or when potentially flopping. Which means existing MKR holders would somehow risk diluting themselves in return for managing the DAI supply this way. The price of MKR at flaps versus price at flops would play the crucial role to assess potential dilution or surplus effect. This is also where the problem lies because you could be buying MKR high and selling low. And in a ES scenario, this is net negative for existing MKR holders, unless they sell at higher prices in between because of MKR demand pressure from flaps. I may be completely wrong here but it got me thinking. ",

Pre-MIP discussion: PSM flapper Proposal Ideas       There is currently a discussion going on in MIP35 that would see maker lend assets purchased via the PSM to compound in order to gain some interest.  I would posit that a better decision for maker to would be to try and get the USDC off of its books outright.  so the TLDR of everything below is: auction off USDC to buyback MKR instead  There are basically 3 motivations behind this in my mind:   In order for the PSM to do its job there needs to be sufficient room between the current liabilities a\u2026     i will say that one thing that is interesting about this idea vs mine is that through holding the MKR in a vault here you may be able to avoid the \u201cbalance sheet reduction\u201d issue in that thread. i will say though, the thing that makes me a bit uneasy about this implementation is that it seems the protocol will more or less just be providing itself with 0 interest debt to buy maker and inflate the supply. It\u2019s hard to even wrap my head around what that means really. FWIW I\u2019m glad to see people are starting to think about what to do about the growing amount of usdc that maker is collecting.
