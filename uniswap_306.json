As a reminder, these are the criteria for inclusion: Inclusion Criteria We define \u201cprojects\u201d as being any entity whose users were excluded from the retroactive UNI allocation due to the proxy contract issue identified above. In order to be eligible for inclusion in this distribution, a \u201cproject\u201d must meet the following criteria:  Prior to September 1st, they exposed a publicly-available user interface either on web or in an integrated mobile application that allowed users to make trades on Uniswap in some capacity.  We include DEX aggregators in this definition \u2014 UNI holders ultimately get their paycheck from market takers, not makers. Aggregators are fundamentally in the interest of Uniswap\u2019s success.  It must be clearly verifiable that said interface / application was available to users prior to September 1st (e.g. if this is not immediately obvious that this is the case, the burden of proof is on the project for demonstrating, for instance, that an interface can be loaded on Wayback Machine, etc.) It must be clearly verifiable that said interface / application  at the time  hooked into a proxy contract calling into Uniswap. Again \u2014 if this is not immediately obvious or verifiable, the burden of proof is on the project to demonstrate this. Finally, the project should provide a list of addresses of affected users.  It must be clearly verifiable that those addresses are associated with the proxy contract system previously identified to be associated with the project . Once again, if this is not immediately obvious, the burden of proof lays with the project.  All provided addresses will be verified against historical Uniswap v1 and v2 calls to exclude any addresses that were not in the call-chain of a Uniswap transaction (successful or failed). Open-source code to verify that this is indeed the case will be published for independent review.  All addresses will be verified for not having been in the initial retroactive UNI allocation. Application Template What is the name of your project? Please provide a link that demonstrates your project hosted an active interface to Uniswap prior to September 1st Please provide a link on Etherscan to the proxy contract or contracts through which your users\u2019 actions on Uniswap were routed How many of your users do you estimate were excluded from the initial airdrop as a result?  Please be sure to exclude from this estimate addresses that are already in the initial airdrop merkle root.  Please submit your applications within the next 48 hours \u2014 we will attempt to approve / request clarification in an expedient manner over the weekend.  No need to over-invest in these applications \u2014 the burden of proof is directly proportional to the scale of users affected. ",

Here\u2019s what I need moving forward to get this proposal to the finish line.  I mentioned this previously, but I want to underscore it again: the earliest date users will get their UNI distributed to them is October 17th.  As such, there is a much higher premium on rigor than on speed in getting this proposal submitted \u2014 though the pulse of the community seems to be largely favorable on this proposal, there are legitimate threads of concern & suspicion that are best addressed through a thoroughly transparent process. By the end of this week, we will be submitting a proposal to the governance module that will grant ERC20 approval to a merkle drop contract we deploy committing to a set of addresses for allocation. That set of addresses will be determined through the process described below.  If the number of addresses committed to is greater than 5% of the original allocation, we will have a discussion around whether and how we wish to minimize the amount of UNI that will ultimately be pulled from the community treasury (e.g. by forcing users to preemptively claim their allocation before October 17th on the merkle drop contract).  Otherwise, we will proceed with allocating UNI to the addresses aligned on in a manner similar to the initial allocation. List of projects currently included:  Dharma DeFi Saver Paraswap (should encompass Monolith users) Nuo 0x API MyEtherWallet Totle Eidoo  1inch.exchange  (clarification requested here @deacix) Furucombo Kyber  Projects Who Wish To Be Included Need To Do This   Within the next 48 hours\u2026  Provide a list of affected addresses from your userbase.  Please post a link that resolves to a JSON file containing the addresses \u2014 we will be programmatically validating them against the list of contract addresses that have ever been in the call-chain of a Uniswap transaction, and publishing code that allows the community to cross-reference the submitted addresses with those involved in Uniswap transactions. Please be sure to omit addresses from your submission that were already in the initial retroactive airdrop \u2014 some of the larger figures quoted for \u201cestimated # of addresses\u201d in the applications likely overlap with the initial Uniswap allocation heavily, given that most of the projects listed were primarily interacted with through a generic web3 wallet like Metamask. Please provide a basic code snippet on Github or Dune Analytics query that demonstrates how you pulled the list of excluded addresses.  We will then compile all of the above into a formalized governance proposal to the broader community.  The goal is to have a list of addresses where:  It\u2019s programatically clear that they were omitted from the original allocation due to the unintentional proxy contract ommission It\u2019s programatically clear that they were not included in the original allocation The amount of UNI that would need to be allocated to this user segment would be, ideally, less than 5% of the original allocation, and, at worst, 10% of the original allocation.

On another note, we have 30,250 addresses in total, after filtering claimed addresses. The reason why it increased from the initial amount in my previous post is because I wrote a Dune Analytics query to fetch the addresses, which lacked addresses trading through our new Kyber proxy contract (0x9aab3f75489902f3a48495025729a0af77d4b11e). We have since wrote a custom script to supplement the dune analytics query, fetching the data using a local node. I believe that a substantial no. of addresses will overlap with some projects as well (Eg. 1inch, Argent etc.) since they have integrated us for the token swaps. ",
