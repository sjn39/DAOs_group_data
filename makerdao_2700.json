Discussion about MKR mining drop by making DAI with part of MEGF\u2018s Mkr token Governance       Is there  any possible that Makerdao lauch a MKR mining drop by Making DAI, and the MKR token could take from the Maker foundation (MEGF\u2014Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation), maybe just a small part of it.  This way will increase the Dai supply quickly, and made DAI to better first mover advatage; also more MKR drop to user will improve the Governance. now COMP drop show the significant advantage to the market share for Compound  AND the MKR drop from Maker foundation will make more holders of MKR\u2026     If we want to further incentivize players to borrow DAI governance could offer MKR as a DAI borrowing reward to all vaults.   Using MKR to incentivize additional borrowing would allow us to raise SF rates.  By offering more MKR value than the DAI being received in the SF is potentially a valid way to do the following:  Allows for Maker to create negative rates by offering more MKR value than DAI fees raised by SF in surplus. Encourage more borrowing (may not be good if this drops CRs) A more robust sell/buy MKR economy and hence more MKR - DAI liquidity generally. A way to set positive SFs and balance these with MKR reward to increase capital flows around MKR-DAI pair. Another way to distribute MKR more widely and possibly get vault participation in MKR governance.  Generally the thinking is that with SF at 2% we could offer 1% MKR mining reward for borrowing and 3% SF to give an effective 2% fee rate.  Or we can offer 3% MKR return with a 2% SF to give a -1% negative rate to borrowers. The con here is that it would apply to all current borrowers and also that it would dilute MKR potentially but this could be offset by surplus buying back MKR. To this end I am putting up a simple poll on the subject to gauge governance on the topic and whether this should be persued in detail or not. A Yes basically means persue the topic. No means don\u2019t persue this, and Abstain/Invalid you can give your own reasons for why you chose those options.     Yes - governance should pay MKR to DAI borrowers to incentivize borrowing. (offer MKR farming) No - MKR should not be used.to incentivize borrowing Abstain - I can\u2019t vote for or against for some reason.  Please note reason below. Invalid - I believe the poll to be invalid.  Please note reason below.     0 voters     ",

Yeah I am not sure.   @LongForWisdom will definitely have some ideas around this.   I will go with whatever signalling is appropriate.   I always had a hard time deciding the tags to use on a post. Is there a place where these are described that I have not found yet?   Like the difference between governance and governance and risk or active-signal and signalling? I am thinking more and more what we are seeing is people using polls really as \u2018informal polls\u2019 mostly to gauge sentiment on a subject.   I am also thinking an informal poll should have as a requirement abstain/invalid with reasons given below along with the choices.  I also agree that some statement about what the choices mean in the post regarding the poll is appropriate.   It was why I gave some examples of why using MKR as a reward for borrowing DAI against the SF in DAI being paid was a way to generate more DAI, but also as an approach to generating an effective negative rate for borrowers that doesn\u2019t break any of the wallet mechanics that other negative rate mechanisms were presenting. The bonus of this model is that while it will look to dilute MKR if the SF is bumped up as well the real effective rate becomes MKR value - DAI SF being paid. ",

Changed the title to include [Informal Poll] and removed everything with signal to polling.   Now I wait for @LongForWisdom to come in and just go all over this.   Going to make me gunshy to ever put up an informal type poll again or at least I will be better informed and I read the signal guidelines a number of times now (changed since the last time I read it). I honestly don\u2019t know now what this should have been.  I know I really just wanted a general signal from the community on whether there was interest in working on such a beast at all. Given how yield farming has taken off it seemed prudent to ask the community to give a signal on this topic and to initiate discussion. One thing I looked at was the whole pre-MIP discussion as a choice.  Making me think we need something like Informal Polls to gauge community sentiment guickly so people can toss out ideas and community yeah or nah persuing them more formally or laying them to rest informally.  This way when people want to submit an idea they can look through the list of stuff already polled on and make a decision to re-up an old idea for new discussion or just leave it rest dead. ",

Hey @befitsandpiper this is why we do these things - we learn and discussss.  I\u2019m good.  I really was just annoyed that I felt like I annoyed other people.     befitsandpiper:  Let\u2019s get back to the topic. Will offering yield farming incentives even help us significantly? We still will be unable to compete with any new crazy yield shenanigans with new protocols offering 100% or 1000% APR. Who would we be trying to meet with this? Maybe the yield for COMP? I imagine the incentive doesn\u2019t matter terribly unless we can undercut another major player.   Well I like to ask \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d.   As I posted above I think offering MKR as a reward can allow us to use two financial levers to give an effective return rate on our vault behaviors that can go to negative rates without breaking anything.  It may further incentivize borrowing where people might have not (but this may have negative effect on CRs).  It might also kind of break the bad behavior - via liquidation mechanisms (particularly if we go negative rates). Offering our vault holders MKR rewards may get them into governance and using MKR as the reward against the SF as the fee we basically create a potentially much more liquid and rich MKR-DAI exchange economy. I am not entirely sure we will beat out other competitors COMP and the like but I think it could put us in the game there.    I think my key points was offering MKR as a vault DAI borrow reward was a way to still have a positive SF on vaults while incentivizing behavior with MKR rewards.   We could even adjust these rewards on a per vault type basis but I think this gets us into another massively complex management tool.  I would just advocate having a rate and turning it on/off on certain vault types.  I also don\u2019t know if this means a new smart contract sub section (called rewards or \u2018food\u2019 if we follow the naming nomenclature on the contracts) that would need to be built and audited. Conceptually I was thinking about a way to get to negative rates that breaks nothing, has minimal overhead and allows us to also raise SF to get a more dynamic DAI economy connected to MKR token proper.  I also thought doing this might give us some PR exposure and bring us into the farming economy in a key way.    Does the gains and costs to discuss and implement offset risks and rewards.  Of that I am uncertain which is why I put this up for polling and discussion. ",

We can only use this trend to introduce similar mining rewards to create a favorable environment for future development. I think that when Maker launches loan mining rewards, it will at least have a sensational advertising effect on the market. If the SF and the rewarded MKR can offset each other or have a certain surplus, the MKR will not be diluted. I will choose to agree. ",

MKR has value to me because I can own a fixed percentage of the system. If that starts being inflated away I would probably dump a large part of my holdings in favor of something like YFI that has a fixed supply where their community is already discussing burning their ability to mint new tokens. If the goal here is to fix the peg, I much prefer cleaner solutions like lowering the CR of fiat-backed stablecoins to enable huge leverage for shorting Dai. ",
