                    "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019ve done a few of these Smart Contract Domain Assessments now, and I decided to write a little bit of a guide based on the template here: https://hackmd.io/@wvj58ecDT7uiW4OFhwy4DQ/ryl2533gv Most of the information for these assessments is on etherscan and can be found from the token tracker page. That said, I have written a short blurb on the requirements for each section. Let me know if I should add any additional information.  Title: [SYMBOL] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Domain Community Assessment tags: -symbol, -sc-domain-work General Information This can mostly be found through etherscan, on the token contract page. Deployment Date can be found by checking the date where the analytics graph begins. Two exceptions are the developers allotment and github page, which may take more searching online and digging. MCD collateral type adapter requires an understanding of the maker adapters: here is the GemJoin contract for well behaving erc20s: https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/b280b98e0c661d5d8effe2e9626e51978dab33ce/src/join.sol#L6 here are GemJoin variants for not quite well behaving erc20s: https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy/blob/a276b5b145c564b465fbcf7adeb302f581762be1/src/join.sol#L334 \u2022 Symbol: \u2022 Address \u2022 Deployment Date: \u2022 Total supply: \u2022 Developers allotment: \u2022 Project website: \u2022 Github repository: \u2022 Can use existing MCD collateral type adapter?  Risk Summary For this we look at the erc20 standard here: https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/ERC20. The solidity contract code can be found by looking under \u201cprofile summary\u201d on the etherscan token tracker page, and clicking the \u201ccontract\u201d link. The contract tab then shows all of the solidity code. A low risk contract is one that follows erc20 or another ethereum standard. Medium and high risk contracts have extra administrative functions, don\u2019t follow basic security protocols, or have strange functions that have questionable merit. Use your best judgment or ask someone if something looks strange. \u2022 Does the contract implement the ERC20 token standards? \u2022 Risk analysis: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH  Technical Information This is all found under the profile summary section of etherscan or within the contract code itself. \u2022 Compiler version: \u2022 Decimals: \u2022 Overflow checks: \u2022 Mitigation against allowance race-condition: \u2022 Upgradeable contract patterns: \u2022 Access control or restriction lists: \u2022 Non-standard features or behaviors:  Formal Verification Considerations: This section involves an analysis of the solidity contract \u2022 Does transfer have simple semantics? \u2022 Does transferFrom have simple semantics? \u2022 Can balances be arbitrarily modified by some actor? \u2022 Are there any external calls?  Testnet Information Requires some digging online, and is likely the most difficult portion of this asessment to discover. It is possible a token will not have testnet information, especially if it is a custodial token for a RWA. \u2022 <Add any relevant testnet information here>  Contract Logic Summary <Add written summary of smart contract logic here, does the contract use a multi-sig, 1-2 paragraphs> \u2022 How the contract is upgraded \u2022 Administrative addresses (EOAs, controller contracts, and similar)  Contract Risk Summary <Add written summary of smart contract risk here, 1-2 paragraphs> Supporting Materials A common tool used for this section is https://github.com/consensys/surya particularly the mdreport function <Add supporting materials, documentation, and graphs here> ",
