In my view the DSR / SF spread should be 0 (or possibly negative if utilization is low). We are first to market with a brand new product. We need to capture as much of the market as possible. I believe we can start pulling new types of users into the Ethereum/Maker ecosystem that aren\u2019t interested in highly speculative gains, but instead safe returns on money that would otherwise be sitting in their checking account. Running a loss leader is a standard business practise that makes sense in a new market like this. I believe we should press on the growth throttle as much as possible. Please discuss. ",

                    "content": "This is a super interesting idea. Let me paraphrase some of my comments from chat on how this would affect risk. Standard operating procedure for risk would be to apply a DSR / Stability fee spread to account for the collateral risk. So, let\u2019s say a risk team evaluates a collateral and pumps out a number something like 4%. Then, if the DSR were at 2% (assuming full utilization), then the stability fee would be 6%. 2% to Dai holders and 4% to MKR holders as compensation. At this level, the Maker Protocol is running (theoretically) at breakeven. In order to change one rate (say, the DSR), you\u2019d need an accompanying change in the other in order to keep Dai stable. And they would move opposite each other. So, for example, if the DSR were to go up by 1 point to 3%, then the Stability Fee would need to (probably) move downwards by 1% to increase supply as well. Increasing/decreasing the spread essentially increases or decreases the risk premium, which is the profit source for MKR. Converging the spread is essentially forgoing profits for increased growth. So, if right now we are at 2% DSR and 4% Stability Fee, we could move it to 3%/3% and the peg would still be stable, but MKR holders would likely start to lose money (its not a linear function in rates but whatever). This would be more attractive for Dai holders and Vault owners. One could even go 10% DSR and -10% Stability Fee if you really wanted to fuel growth. So, the downside of this is that with extra losses, the MKR market is lower (ignoring projected growth increases due to increased users), and the tolerable debt ceiling would be lower. So once we start discussing what tolerable debt ceilings are (soon\u2122), we can try to predict what type of monetary policy would be needed to achieve our \u201cgrowth\u201d goal. DISCLAIMER: I am not in favor or against this idea, as its a business-oriented decision that should be decided by the MKR community. I can only help quantify the tradeoffs and maybe share an opinion or two down the line. ",

As Cyrus said, this is a business decision, but it\u2019s important to remember that while it might look like we are break-even, or turning a small profit, that comes at the cost of failing to compensate for risk. Second, we\u2019re in an industry where everything is very open, and expectations are very high. There is a belief that rent seeking should be minimised as much as possible and this belief is enforced by the threat of protocol forks*. If we start up MCD with a loss leader approach, at some point we will need to end that approach. At that point, we are at risk of a backlash or a aggressive fork in response. Despite the dislike of rent seeking, I think the risks of this are less if we set the expectation early that we are always going to be taking a small profit. *As a side note, the protocol is rent-seeking, but it needs to be otherwise the incentives don\u2019t work. In my view this negative is balanced by the fact that MKR Holders are the lender of last resort and are on the hook for their decisions in a way that traditional bankers aren\u2019t. ",

                    "content": "Folks I\u2019m still trying to work on a proposal in relation to what I\u2019m going to post here so to keep this short. Where does one put growth relative to risk and how is this managed?! Literally having a fixed SF even when utilization is nearing or at 100% of the debt ceiling is NOT really the best way to address these market issues. I am toying with two ideas ignoring the very important implementation aspects (just looking at this from a how to manage risk, liquidity, peg, against growth).   Instead of the DSR why not just take a % (that would be managed by governance votes of the incoming revenue stream and designate it to the DSR fund - call this DSR-SF-PERCENTAGE).   This would give a floating DSR that is based purely on the MCD-XXX-SF fee collection as well as the DSR utilization and could always be set to under say 90%) to always give MakerDAO at LEAST 10% profit on all SF fees collected.    This would then have the added bonus of adjusting the DSR based both on DSR utilization and SF fees?   Make the SF\u2019s \u2018SF targets\u2019 based on utilization curves.    Simple example say the MCD-XXX-SF target is 4%.   Make a MCD-XXX-SF a function based on the utilization to produce DAI (loan generation).    MCD-XXX-SF(U, MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET, MCD-XXX-U-TARGET),  where U=utilization, MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET = MCD-XXX-SF as currently designed, and MCD-XXX-U-TARGET=the desired MCD-XXX utilization target percentage.    What the form of this function is the community can decide but it should have the effect of lowering the MCD-XXX-SF below the MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET by up to 2x if utilization is low, and increasing it above the MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET by at least 2x if utilization is high.   There are additional changes I want to propose in conjuction with the above two but I want to point out a number of important factors that come about if the above model were to be implemented.  the DSR or (DSR-SF-PERCENTAGE) by definition/construction is always a rate that never causes MakerDAO to lose money as contrasted with current situation that if DSR deposit interest exceed loan income MakerDAO loses money. the DSR rate will change up or down based on both DSR and all Maker/loan SF utilization allowing MakerDAO DSR to always stay competitive with minimum of governance votes.  The DSR-SF-PERCENTAGE is still a lever governance can use to modify behavior to sop up or loosen DAI liquidity based on savings behaviors. If designed properly debt ceilings should rarely if ever be hit and utilization will always be some amount above 0.   This will mean there will always be available DAI liquidity to be minted if the DAI loses it\u2019s PEG (both in bad and good markets) and will manage loan risk as an added benefit. Maximizes SF return to MakerDAO owners. Allows all fees to float to be market competitive with the least amount of governance voting.  If we can design a system that allows the markets and market participants themselves to act for us to manage the system - it will. Allows for \u2018good growth\u2019 Still have the MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET levers as well as an additional MCD-XXX-U-TARGET lever  My proposal only leaves a few parameters to be managed.  MCD-XXX-SF-TARGET (XXX stability fee target) MCD-XXX-U-TARGET (XXX-utilization target percentage) DSR-SF-PERCENTAGE (percentage of fees that goes into the DSR payout pot) MCD-XXX-DC (debt ceiling)  May need to adjust this but  MCD-XXX-SF as a function of 1,2 which should only need to be changed maybe once or twice in the lifetime of MakerDAO to optimize the following parameters  a)   least need for governance votes on 1-3 b)   maximizes utilization and growth c)   minimizes risk d)   optimizes DAI liquidity and PEG during bull/bear market. e)   allows MakerDAO to be more competitive against the secondary markets. f)   allows markets and market participants themselves to manage the DSR rate (if utilization high and DSR rate low - people will move to secondary markets for better rate and vice versa)  As to the technical design.  One thing I think will need to be changed is that the DSR probably should be tokenized ala compound or DAI-HRD type functionality so the DSR-SF-PERCENTAGE payments just float into the collection account increasing the mDAI value on withdrawal and accurately accounting for interest accumulation using multiple floating SF rates.

I do not support rent seeking beyond a modest amount as protocol forks are always a danger of being too greedy. What I am arguing for now is to forego the modest profits we should aim to have in a mature system to keep things growing as fast as possible in this new market.  I sympathize with the temptation and I would only be weakly opposed to some very short term, limited growth boost.  @swakya I do not believe this should be a short term plan. We should forego profits until we reach market maturity or at least somewhere decently far along the adoption S-curve.  Still here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a bad idea, generally speaking: it will be hard enough to maintain the DAI price while managing MKR risk. Beyond the DSR we may have to directly tune the SF for supply reasons (rather than risk reasons). That\u2019s already one source of tension (in the \u201cmonetary trilemma\u201d sense).

On top of that @LongForWisdom\u2019s concerns about what happens when we reverse course are very much justified.  This should be no more difficult to maintain then any other plan as we are just setting the DSR to be some constant factor away from the ETH-SF (could be 0). As @cyrus said above something like raising the DSR to 3% and lowering the (BAT/ETH)-SF to 3% makes sense to me since the fees work in opposite directions for peg stability. After that you would raise and lower those numbers together for monetary policy.  I like the idea of fast healthy growth of DAI supply by temporary lowering MKR holders\u2019 revenue. but we need to know how to define healthy and secure growth at what DAI supply we should stop subsidizing DSR? what percentage of total ethereum market cap being held in maker vaults can be considered the upper safe limit (5% ,10%?), how about other less secure collaterals? also I remember that with MCD we should be able to give different SF to different collateral ratios to encourage safer loans!  @mmoossttaaffaa I am calling this the fastest possible healthy growth because we are maximizing both the supply and demand to the largest amount possible. In theory minimizing the SF will maximize supply growth and maximizing the DSR will maximize DAI demand growth.  So, the downside of this is that with extra losses, the MKR market is lower (ignoring projected growth increases due to increased users), and the tolerable debt ceiling would be lower. So once we start discussing what tolerable debt ceilings are (soon\u2122), we can try to predict what type of monetary policy would be needed to achieve our \u201cgrowth\u201d goal.  @cyrus As we discussed in the chat, I don\u2019t think taking losses upfront will necessarily lower the MKR market cap as the market cap is not a measure of the current MKR burn, but both current and projected MKR burn. If we are making smart decisions to grow the user base then the MKR market cap should increase even with short/medium term losses. The debt ceiling is probably the main piece that I am uncertain about because there become non-trivial risks if we grow the supply too fast. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing more about where the limits of that are. ",

In practice, as you & cyrus mentioned, it will often be possible to move DSR/SF in opposite directions to maintain the price, but generally speaking the forces may be asymmetrical and we\u2019d then have to favor either the peg or risk management. Hence my point about adding yet another possible function (profit/growth) to those knobs. ",

Obviously it is critical that in the long term, the average spread needs to follow (and be higher than) the average loss from insolvent liquidations. But in the short run there are more important factors to consider. One being the DSR utilization being very low, which by itself should always trigger a minimal spread until the utilization hopefully maxes out close to 100%. As long as DSR utilization is low attempts at risk modeling the spread are futile, since the actual spread will be mainly determined by the utilization. But beyond the DSR utilization issue, theres also the positive effect a low spread will have on the MCD migration, which will bring in much greater fees than a high spread would in the short term. More importantly theres the fundamental dynamic of MKR liquidity and price following growth of MakerDAOs ecosystem rather than MKR burned directly, so focusing on growing the ecosystem will actually provide greater security to Dai holders than trying to extract value in the short run. And finally of course the fact that a lower spread, but on a greater supply, ultimately results in high fees. Either in the short run, or in the long run as the spread is slightly increased again to properly be set above whats necessary to cover insolvent liquidations. ",

As a mkr holder, I would support operating the protocol at near breakeven (very little mkr burn) for the next year to increase dai growth rate. In the end, the mkr peg ratio (mkr price to earnings / mkr earnings growth rate) will benefit and mkr holders will eventually see the mkr value appreciate due to the network effect of mass adoption of Dai. I do agree with @LongForWisdom on the risk of backlash when rates are \u201cnormalized\u201d. For this reason, I believe the community should signal that mkr holders are \u201csubsidizing\u201d these attractive rates to bootstrap adoption of this new technology. ",

This does not include the additional per-collateral SF for risk premium. In this sense I really do think that the global SF minus the DSR should be 0, and that we should use the per-collateral SFs to capture the risk premiums. Here is how I am thinking of the system parameters overall.  Global Stability Fee - Used for week to week monetary policy. This should be viewed as the MCD equivalent of the SCD SF adjustment. Global SF / DSR Spread (Global SF minus DSR rate) - Should be relatively constant and reflect how much of a profit margin we want to run. Setting this to 0 will tune the system to maximum growth whereas a higher number will increase profit margin. Per-vault type SF - This should be mapped directly to the risk premium and we should aim to run breakeven numbers here as we can capture profit in the global SF. In this mental model we can separate out the monetary lever, profit/growth lever and the risk premium levers into the respective system values above. As an example) Let\u2019s say the risk premium for ETH-A is 2% and after making the choice for maximum growth (DSR spread of 0) the supply/demand equilibrium of the market is calling for a 4% SF. Then the cost of opening an ETH-A vault is (4% global SF + 2% risk premium) = 6% in fees. The DSR is set to 4%. ",
