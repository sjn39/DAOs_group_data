                    "content": "I\u2019d like to start a discussion around KPIs for MakerDAO with the community. Unlike the traditional financial and equity markets, there is little or no consensus around how cryptocurrencies are valued today. Stocks and bonds are typically valued using a discounted cash flow model - the present value of all future cash flows generated by a company discounted back to the present. Cryptocurrencies have a variety of different use cases and some present challenges to using a traditional valuation framework. There are some cryptos used primarily as a medium of exchange or store of value where a DCF is not applicable - some analysts have proposed valuing these based on the quantity theory of money. \u2018Utility\u2019 cryptocurrencies may be the most complex type of crypto to value - value is largely dependent on the demand for services transacted on the platform and the supply of tokens (which can be impacted by staking and other incentives to lock/remove a portion of the supply from the markets). Unlike the aforementioned types of cryptocurrencies, the framework for valuing DeFi tokens lends itself to traditional valuation methodologies. Many of these tokens take some sort of fee that grows as Total Value Locked (TVL) increases or as transactions increase which makes a DCF a logical choice when attempting to value the token. IMO, MKR falls into this category. There are many factors which contribute to the success of an enterprise, some more easily quantifiable than others. In order for MakerDAO to succeed long term, we must deeply analyze and understand what drives MKR\u2019s value so we can efficiently allocate capital and resources to maximize it\u2019s value. In order to do this, I\u2019d like the community\u2019s input on what KPIs they are looking at and which they feel are most important to MKR\u2019s long term success. Here are a few I\u2019m sure most have thought of to start the discussion (in no particular order):  Total Risk Assets Outstanding Interest Income Correlation Net Interest Income Total DAI Outstanding DAI Market Share DAI on-chain volume Gross Interest Income Vaults Opened  Once we have a reasonable consensus on our most important KPIs, we can evaluate potential opportunities and investments more effectively and prioritize. Important factors to consider for prospective investments include: TAM (Total Addressable Market), cost to implement, ROI (long-term), margins (how lucrative could this investment be, strategic advantages (i.e. will offering a complementary product improve our lending demand), and risks. For starters, I think focusing on three to five primary KPIs feels optimal. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! ",

Basically it\u2019s tallying how many places Dai is available to the end user and comparing it to other stablecoins. The metric is important because of how quickly a startup can grow to command big market share in this space. The best example I can think of is Compound - Dai was the first stablecoin on the platform because our team put in the legwork and valued the integration even though they were just getting up and running, this paid off hundreds of times over when crypto money markets took off and USDC was not the default option.

This ties into the above since we are paying CUs out of the SB. Pretty sure MakerDAO would be the first in the crypto space to provide guidance which would likely generate a lot of interest from traditional financial market investors and publicity. ",

Wading through the defi-world with a quickly scalable platform that brings network effect like volume without a forecast is possible, but how can we evaluate our credit risk, VAR, desired stability buffer for a rainy day on a continuous basis as we add numerous collaterals, both RWA and not, without a forecast? Audited Historical Financials are confirmatory; forecasts are a tool to give the DAO better decision making, as are KPIs, so the original inquiry made me wonder\u2026is this possible? Do we have any visibility to the upside/downside or are we as a DAO just hoping to grow, grow, grow, and that the engineered systems will be able to last another bear market/black swan without wiping out our revenues/MKR value\u2026 To sum this up: A forecast: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months could help us answer the questions\u2026 Do we need to keep revenues today because there is a ceiling for DaI? (TAM, Market share losing concerns, Regulation, Financial Controls/Leverage Ratios) Do we have an understanding of what next year looks like Revenues/Expenses to allow for core units to expand and MKR value to accrue? What reporting can we form to analyze extreme to the downside/extreme to the upside to give us a basis to make decisions for ST value accrual to MKR holders, LT safety and security of the DAO? Just food for thought ",
