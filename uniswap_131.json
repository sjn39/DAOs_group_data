As many will know already the default list of tokens is no longer supported and the UI is refreshed using Geminis token list. I believe there are currently a number of tokens on the Uniswap Default token list that are out of date and need updated. I think it would be great to refresh the list and remove unsupported or out of date tokens. ANT (Aragon Network Token) went through a upgrade last year and the V1 is still appearing on the default list. I wanted to open up this thread to help support the Uniswap community and maybe some of the other projects who would also like there tokens updated on the default list which is no longer supported. I can then pull a proposal together with Projects that would like to be updated. See Discord conversation here for more context on the default list no longer being supported: Discord Would love to here the feedback also happy to hear other solutions. ",
