                    "content": " MIP4c2-SP26: Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments  Preamble MIP4c2-SP#: 26 MIP to be amended: MIP41 Author(s): CodeKnight Contributors: @blimpa @Gala Tags: mip-amendment Status: Accepted Date of Amendment Submission: 2022-09-01 Date of ratification: 2022-10-24 Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c2-sp26-amend-minimum-feedback-period-for-facilitator-offboarding/17592 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmYgLJ1q   Specification  Motivation The long RFC period for Facilitator offboardings creates uncertainty for the DAO, the Facilitator, and DAO partners. It can also hold up valuable work if the Facilitator in question is not fulfilling his mandate. A Facilitator who should be offboarded should be offboarded quickly. A Facilitator who should not be offboarded benefits from having the proposal resolved quickly. If there is uncertainty, proposers always have the option of using more than the minimum time period. In addition, the wording on facilitator offboarding could use improvement. Govalpha suggested some improvements that I have integrated into this amendment.  Amended Components MIP41c5  Changes MIP41c5 is amended to read  MIP41c5: Facilitator Offboarding This component is twofold:  It describes how Facilitators are to be handled in the event of a Core Unit offboarding via MIP39c3. It establishes the process to offboard Facilitators. Full Core Unit offboardings are to be put forth via MIP39c3.  1. Facilitators and Core Unit Offboardings via MIP39c3 If a Core Unit offboarding subproposal passes, the Facilitator(s) of the affected Core Unit immediately loses all special powers listed on MIP41c2/MIP41c3. The Facilitator becomes a Retiring Facilitator in charge of executing the unwinding process for the offboarding Core Unit (described on MIP39c3). If the Retiring Facilitator fails to execute the unwinding plan, an Interim Facilitator - further defined in MIP41c6 - will take over these responsibilities. 2. Facilitator Offboarding Process A Facilitator can be offboarded without having the Core Unit they are attached to being offboarded. An Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community. If a Facilitator wishes to voluntarily offboard, a MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community. If a Facilitator goes missing, an Interim Facilitator will take over responsibilities during the transition. A MIP41c4 subproposal proposing a new Facilitator should be submitted by the Interim Facilitator or by any other member of the Community. MIP41c5 subproposal parameters are:  Minimum Feedback Period: 2 weeks. Minimum Frozen Period: 1 week. Poll Duration: 1 week.  MIP41c5 subproposals must use the template located at MIP41c5-Subproposal-Template.md   Relevant Github Link Link to Pull Request  Relevant Information MIP41 ",

A CU without its facilitator cant operate efficiently so making that process quickier only leaves the protocol with less time to find a succesor. I actually think unless a CU is being completely offboarded, the facilator should remain until a succesor is identifed. There can always be exceptions to this rule (e.g. clearly the team can operate without facilator) but it shouldnt be the norm to offboard the facilator without having a replacement ready. ",

Of course, there are unintended effects in this treatment \u2013 job stability and predictability is the underlying issue, as well as autonomy. Maker governance is slow, which is a blessing until you need to react quickly. Rather than try to work directly through governance to manage this issue, which is trying to bend a \u201cslow\u201d structure to handle \u201cfast\u201d decisions, the structure of the DAO- facilitator relationship could be considered and the structure of the financial arrangements, auditor wallets, etc. Just as in cognition, there need to be \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d decisions in governance. Producing a clear taxonomy of governance actions with affordances to meet the requirements of various scenarios is a significant lift, but is likely to happen as we look to governance as a product which will scale across MetaDAOs.

One thing from a governance perspective to consider is the difference between:  facilitator offboarding where you want to keep the CU but with a new facilitator offboarding a CU entirely through MIP39c3.  I would suggest adding some clarifying language that these new parameters only apply to scenario 1 because otherwise the facilitator could potentially be offboarded before the rest of the CU which will just get a bit messy. You also might want to consider submitting MIP41c5 subproposals into the weekly cycle rather than the monthly cycle if your intention is to speed up the process as otherwise you might find that you\u2019re still waiting around for the monthly cycle to start after the feedback period has ended.     TRUEMAKER:  1 month for feedback, 1 week frozen period and then 2 weeks for on chain voting? Which gives you 7 weeks total? I guess that could be reduced to 5 weeks\u2026   Worth pointing out that the feedback period and the frozen period can overlap, which shortens your timeline by a week - see MIP0c3. ",

I\u2019d maybe format it as:  The proposal parameters are: Minimum feedback period: [insert desired period] Minimum frozen period: [insert desired period] Governance Cycle: Weekly  So it\u2019s consistent with other subproposals that may enter the weekly cycle, such as MIP4c3 subproposals. The other thing to consider is vote duration. Given facilitators\u2019 powerful position within governance, removing a facilitator is a significant decision for the DAO, so the three days afforded by the weekly cycle may be too short. So your other option would be not to put them into the weekly cycle and instead put them into a special category like Greenlight polls, where they don\u2019t go into the monthly cycle but have a longer duration than a standard weekly poll. So, for example:  The proposal parameters are:  Minimum feedback period: [insert desired period] Minimum frozen period: [insert desired period] Duration of poll: [1 week? 2 weeks?]  MIP41c5 subproposals are eligible to move on-chain on the first Monday after their feedback period has concluded.

This amendment aims to expedite the process to offboard a Facilitator. Currently, Facilitator offboarding subproposals enter the monthly cycle, and their Minimun Feedback Period is one month, with the on-chain Ratification Polls lasting two weeks. This amendment reduces the Minimum feedback period to two weeks and changes the poll duration to one week. This subproposal also aims to make some minor language modifications to increase clarity. MIP4c2-SP26 has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  ",
