                    "content": " Intro The purpose of this Informal Poll is to get a clearer picture of the MakerDAO community sentiment towards onboarding a new collateral type (e.g., WBTC-B Vault) backed by B.Protocol, which will offer a lower collateral ratio (CR) while keeping the same stability fee (SF) as the existing one (e.g., WBTC-A). This vault type will be accessible via Maker standard interfaces, and any platform (e.g., Oasis, Instadapp, and other integrations) could offer it to its users. The only proposed change is in the liquidation mechanism. Further to the discussion we started a week ago, and after presenting the topic in a MakerDAO Collateral Onboarding call, and the discussion that followed it, we are looking for feedback from the governance on whether it sees this proposal as something that would help Maker, before we continue with the technical implementation efforts. B.Protocol is offering to add a new collateral type, for example, WBTC-B, which will have the same stability fees as WBTC-A, with a lower collateral ratio. B.Protocol liquidators would be forced to hold a WBTC-B Vault with a net positive position of $0.5M. Upon liquidation of a user, the liquidators are forced to take the user position (debt + proportional part of the collateral). In the event that a liquidator Vault becomes undercollateralized, it will get liquidated by the usual Maker liquidation process, i.e., in an open English or Dutch auction. We illustrated the proposal with more details in the discussion post, however at this point we ask for feedback on the concept, rather than on the concrete parameters. If we get a positive response to this informal poll, we will pursue the idea further and do the following:   Ask for additional feedback on the concrete parameters (both from the community as well as from the SC and Risk teams which we are already in touch with), and submit a Declaration of Intent proposal, via MIP13, to get the community consensus about these parameters.   Implement the needed smart contract changes - we plan to implement all the needed changes, both on B.Protocol and Maker side.   On-board committed liquidators, likely from our genesis backstop.   I will summarize the pros and cons of the proposal below.  Enable a Collateral with B.Protocol as a Backstop B.Protocol is a decentralized backstop protocol. We are live for one month, backstopping around $11m of ETH-A collateral and $4.5m debt. A first successful demonstration of the protocol capabilities was done during the sharp market crash on Thursday 26/11. B.Protocol introduces the concept of relying on committed liquidators, who get priority in the liquidation process, in return for their commitment.  Pros   Maker gets to offer a lower collateral ratio, which means that users could obtain higher leverage by using Maker, and/or have more relaxed collateral requirements if they are not interested in leverage. In the long run, this will increase the DAI circulation, and therefore the stability fees for the MKR holders.   It is our perspective that it will be done not only without compromising the stability of Maker, but it will even contribute to its stability, as it adds another layer of committed liquidators, while still leaving Maker as the ultimate backstop (like in the present state). Note: While this approach is quite a standard in the TradFi world, it should still be considered subjective, and this signal request aims to get the Maker community\u2019s opinion on that.   B.Protocol team will do all the development work needed for the collateral on-boarding.    Cons   Due to the low CR proposed, MakerDAO will have to give up at least some (if not all) of the liquidation penalty proceeds, in order to allow sufficient incentives for the liquidators, without imposing the user with a higher liquidation penalty (which will make the collateral type less attractive than WBTC-A).   The proposed backstop liquidation mechanism does not give mathematical guarantees or insurance like was offered by Nexus Mutual. The community should understand that we simply commit into building a protocol with incentives for big traders/liquidators to on-board and to bootstrap it with initial liquidators. Neither we nor the liquidators commit to the success of liquidations. However, the liquidators have a clear stake to lose if they fail.   While we plan to do the development work for both sides, this proposal will probably add some workload to the domain teams, who will likely be requested by the community to express their opinion before going live with it.   This proposal, and the pros and cons listed above, are relevant for both Liquidation 1.2 as well as for Liquidation 2.0 once it will be deployed.  Poll We ask the community feedback on the next 5 questions. It should be noted that questions 1-4 are tightly coupled, and negative responses to questions 2-4 might make the proposed design infeasible.    Are you comfortable with Maker offering a Vault type backed by B.Protocol\u2019s liquidators (according to the scheme described above)?   Yes   No   Abstain      0 voters        Given a Vault type is backed by B.Protocol\u2019s liquidators.

Would you vote for a lower collateral ratio?   Yes   No   Abstain      0 voters        Given a vault type is backed by B.Protocol liquidators. Would you agree to vote that when the liquidation is done by B.Protocol, the Maker DAO will not get the Liquidation Penalty?   Yes   No   Abstain      0 voters        Which assets would you like to see used for Vaults of this nature?   ETH   WBTC   Other   Any      0 voters     This informal poll will run for 2 weeks (Dec 28th) and can be extended if there is not enough activity or consensus. ",

Planet_X:  in crypto a committed liquidator is only one transaction away from being non-committed.   the proposed solution suggests that liquidators will commit by locking funds, and if they fail to liquidate they will lose it. So they will have a lot to lose if they fail/stop being committed.

The only part I didn\u2019t agree with in the poll above was giving B.Protocol the entirety of the liquidation fee. I believe B.Protocol should be entitled to the vast majority of the fee, but that Maker should get a small percentage from that interaction if implemented as proposed, given that we are sending over some users (and potential liquidations) to this backstop via the Oasis platform.

                    "content": "A general technical perspective: one concern with both liquidations 1.2 and 2.0 is that auction participation is zero-sum and subject to value extraction by miners, which makes developing a robust ecosystem of committed Keepers challenging. B.Protocol quite literally changes the game theory around liquidations to favor cooperative strategies that evenly share liquidation proceeds among capital contributors. I believe this mechanism, or one like it, could be the optimal path forward for reliable and safe liquidations (with an auction mechanism always available as a fallback). One thing I think people commenting on the liquidation penalty should keep in mind is that it primarily exists to prevent auction grinding; generating additional protocol income is a side effect. IIUC, there is no \u201cliquidation grinding\u201d attack possible with B.Protocol because liquidators are bound by the smart contracts to repay debt fully or not at all (@yaronvel please correct me if I\u2019m mistaken). If integrating B.Protocol incentivizes higher Vault usage (because liquidations are less risky and parameters are more favorable), this could very well compensate for the loss of penalty fees in the long run. That said, it might also be reasonable for some portion to still go to MakerDAO and I leave that for the community and B.Protocol to negotiate :). IMO it\u2019s best to experiment early and often; so long as downside risk from the integration is managed via appropriate sizing of max debt ceiling of the new collateral type, I don\u2019t see why the DAO should need to wait for, say, Liquidations 2.0 before trialing B.Protocol. Auction parameters for the new ilk will have to be considered carefully, however\u2013there is additional tail risk because while B.Protocol will make typical liquidation events more predictable in outcome, a very large event that liquidates the backstop Vault itself will result in an immediate and huge auction event (mitigated somewhat by parameters like box in 1.2, but that just reinforces the need to choose parameters carefully).

Kurt_Barry:  That said, it might also be reasonable for some portion to still go to MakerDAO and I leave that for the community and B.Protocol to negotiate    The proposal could work even if liquidation penalty is not fully 0, so there is a room for discussion there. it should be noted though that every $1 that goes to penalty is either on the expense of the user, or on the expense of the backstop, which will eventually lead to a weaker backstop. Also as a side note, a lending platform that takes liquidation penalty to itself, or in general profit from its user losses (while controlling the price feed, and other parameters) , is somewhat of a conflict of interest.     Kurt_Barry:  however\u2013there is additional tail risk because while B.Protocol will make typical liquidation events more predictable in outcome, a very large event that liquidates the backstop Vault itself will result in an immediate and huge auction event   this is a good point. For the short term, in a small experiment the risk is mitigated by the small size. But moving forward this could be mitigated by forcing requirements on the number of liquidators before increasing the ceiling. In this case every liquidator insolvency will only trigger a medium size liquidation. It is true that there is likely a correlation between liquidator insolvency (i.e., it is not an independent random variable), but this is also the case now where there is a correlation between CDPs insolvency (though likely at current state the variance is lower). In the long run it gives a unique opportunity for the Maker DAO to require (and enforce) advance risk management criteria over the liquidators, and liquidate them if they do not adhere. But this should evolve over time, and could be best decide after extensive experiments. ",

I think we need to think hard about the following though:  the debt ceiling the LIQ-1.2 or LIQ-2.0 parameters, as these are the backstop sharing the liquidation penalty (more on this later) collateralization ratio  It\u2019s true that the liquidation penalty is in place to stop auction grinding attacks, but I noticed something interesting on the Thanksgiving pullback.  Unlike on Black Thursday, the most recent pullback saw a large spike in surplus (flap) auctions from the liquidation penalty.  I believe the protocol received 1.5 to 2 days worth of additional MKR burn from liquidation penalties from fees.  We never got to see this healthier operation of liquidations on BT, and what it meant was that while MKR was pulling back, there was aggressive support of the MKR price on exchanges.  This is still minor compared to the overall market pullback, but that means that more MKR was purchased off the market at favorable prices and burned.  This function ends up being highly desirable if market conditions continue to deteriorate, as we may eventually see prices that are so bad they lead to no collateral left for Vault holders, no liquidation penalty left, and eventually bad debt that could eat the surplus buffer and lead to debt (flop) auctions.  In this scenario, the earlier flap auctions built up some capacity in MKR that the protocol now needs, as it will mint() more to recapitalize the system.  For this reason, I think the community should heavily consider sharing any liquidation penalty. So, as much as the liquidation penalty was a way to prevent auction grinding attacks and ward off liquidations by being considerably worse than what a Vault holder could unwind on the market for, it turns out the penalty has some income/safety potential for the Maker Protocol.  I think there is a strong chance that LIQ-2.0 would be all the protocol needs, at least for now, to secure liquidations into the future; however, I think the B Protocol experiment can\u2019t hurt to try and helps us hedge against potential LIQ-2.0 shortcomings.  For that reason, I am in favor of an experiment with a small debt ceiling to start, but MKR holders need to be prepared for the failure of any such experiment that could wipe out the protocol\u2019s surplus buffer and ruin our capacity to fund teams.  We have a growing number of these experiments, and perhaps should plan accordingly for the failure of one or more of them at the same time. @yaronvel I just wanted to indicate, and risk teams can say more, that LIQ-2.0 with dutch auctions using single-block composability should so greatly improve liquidations that risk premiums and possibly liquidation ratios will likely be adjusted.  To that end, it may be worth highlighting the additional benefits of B Protocol\u2019s solution over LIQ-2.0. ",

I agree LIQ-2.0 is much better than LIQ-1(.2). But the concept remains the same (and similar to all current DeFi platforms) of throwing all the bad positions to arbitrage bots, and it gives very little incentive to construct anything more than a flash loan arbitrage bot. This is very similar to bitmex throwing bad positions to its orderbook, but this is only a first level of protection in bitmex. For Maker it would mean that the CR will mostly be bound by uniswap liquidity, which is still order of magnitude(s) lower than CeFi USD/BTC liquidity (it is true that DAI != USD, but a robust hedging system could rely on it being a correlated asset). This approach is not unique to Maker, and even if the LIQ-2.0 could support CR like in compound, it is still very far from CeFi levels. And accordingly the ability to collect fees would be lower.     cmooney:  it turns out the penalty has some income/safety potential for the Maker Protocol   this is a fair point, and it is up to the community to decide. One might argue that high CR are an obstacle towards earning more from stability fees.     cmooney:  MKR holders need to be prepared for the failure of any such experiment that could wipe out the protocol\u2019s surplus buffer and ruin our capacity to fund teams. We have a growing number of these experiments, and perhaps should plan accordingly for the failure of one or more of them at the same time.   another fair point. all I can say is that liquidators will also have a lot on stake to lose, and maybe even more than the Maker DAO (though it depends on the parameters). Recall that Maker keepers would still be there if B.Protocol fails, so the theoretical max loss is not the entire ceiling, but rather only the delta in CR times ceiling. We are not selling an insurance. Though if you want to do 2 experiments at once, maybe Maker can combine this experiment with Nexus Mutual insurance . My personal view is that the proposed system is strictly safer, but I can see why this could be subjective, and in this case it is a trade-off between a potential of earning more stability fees, and the risk of becoming under-collateralized.

I believe the protocol received 1.5 to 2 days worth of additional MKR burn from liquidation penalties from fees   I think this is one of the key reasons why we should be hesitant to give away the liquidation penalty in its entirety to B.Protocol. Clearly, B.Protocol\u2019s liquidators have to be heavily incentivized to be forced to take on liquidations at any time, and even more so considering the capital required up front to participate. However, if the entirety of the liquidation fee is kept out of the Maker system we lose a key chance to pick up MKR at a discounted rate, while also (in theory) losing a good chunk of SFs due to vaults being liquidated. While my initial split suggestion of 10% to B and 3% to Maker didn\u2019t have any math behind it, I do think it\u2019s pretty close to what should be deemed fair. While I do think we would benefit tremendously from B.Protocol testing and implementing obligated liquidators into our process, it is worth noting that we are doing pretty well under the current system and will be doing even better with Liquidations 2.0.     yaronvel:  Also as a side note, a lending platform that takes liquidation penalty to itself, or in general profit from its user losses (while controlling the price feed, and other parameters) , is somewhat of a conflict of interest.   I also wanted to push back on this a little, as while it certainly opens up the avenue for malicious actions on the side of Maker, it\u2019s hard to say charging a fee as a deterrent to users not monitoring their collateral is a conflict of interest. We are providing a service, expressly stated to our users, and if they break the contract in which we lay out what is a safe collateralization then we are not in conflict for taking profits from the operation of incentivizing a return to a stable collateralization ratio for the system. Yes we control the parameters and measuring of what is safe for the vaults, but in an open source fashion that allows anyone engaging with the system to see clearly how it will behave in different market scenarios ",

I think it is perfectly fine to say that any liquidation event increase the risk to the system, and MKR holders should be compensated for it. And moreover that even if B.Protocol liquidate the Vault it still increase the risk to MKR holders, and then we can discuss concrete parameters. If you take it into the extreme, then Bitmex board of directors assemble at the quarterly meeting and clearly define it is a desirable source of profit (as oppose to risk mitigation), is a clear conflict of interest imo. In Maker, MKR token is the protection to DAI. So profit and increase risk protection is somewhat the same. Hence, it is less of a binary observation, and each option has its pros and cons. ",

                    "content": "Customized Vaults from a systemic perspective The proposal to have a customized Vault type especially intended for B Protocol liquidation raises some interesting questions. In order for customized liquidations to make sense they must provide some economic benefit. Do they bring in additional capital to the liquidation process? If yes - good. What is their profit mechanics? Do they compete with Maker for profit? If yes - this is bad. How do they compete with other service providers of the same type? With regards to the first question the answer is most likely \u201cyes\u201d. Using specialized liquidation providers would bring in additional capital to the liquidation process. However, it remains to be seen if this approach is more efficient compared to meta type solutions where a twitter bot could signal auction activity to the wider community or a Maker auction API where upcoming auction data is published for anyone to benefit from. Then there is the question of profit mechanics. If B Protocol in any ways gets a part of the liquidation penalty then B Protocol exits in a zero-sum competitive relationship with Maker. This is definitely not good. And it gets worse - if B Protocol is successful there will be more teams seeing the same advantage. These will not only be in competition with Maker but also with each other. Imagine Maker in the not so distant future with hundreds of collateral types and two handful of liquidation providers that are all dependent on Maker for a good parts of their profit, in competition with Maker for the same money and in competition with each other for privileges. The resulting noise is going to be unbearable - this is no way to have a life. On top of this there is the aspect of protocol safety where there is a certain aspect of risk with any change. Other folks here are in better position to touch upon this so I will not mention it further. There are three directions branching out from this:  Maker does not have Vaults customized for liquidation purposes. This is the current situation. Maker has Vaults customized for liquidation purposes, but they are identical for B Protocol and all their upcoming competitors Maker is open to have customized Vaults on a general level.  Let\u2019s discuss the pros and cons of each solution   In the case of Maker not having Vaults customized for liquidation it is just a continuation of the existing system and with regards to liquidations there is a level playing field.   Maker could also go down the path of experimenting with B Protocol with regards to liquidations and then apply the agreed solution across the field to all liquidation providers in order to both offer the same terms to all financial service providers of this kind, avoid overhead heavy negotiations and limit the level of required coding. The problem is however that different liquidation providers will want special deals for different collateral types. So Maker would have to open up a specific collateral type beginning with WBTC and then offer this collateral type to all providers of liquidation services.   Maker could open up for customized Vaults on a more general level, allowing for widespread experimentation and innovation. Sounds optimal until you think of the amount of administrative overhead, the amount of additional protocol work as well as the noise such a strategy would generate.   To sum it up - I am going to vote against giving B Protocol any custom Vault. This is in my opinion not a good direction as it will not scale Maker. B Protocol can participate in the normal liquidation process like anyone else, it is still a good business. ",

It is quite unfortunate to me that this is your point of view. IMO it is no where near zero sum game, as it will increase the stability fee, which is Maker main source of revenue. With or without B.Protocol, you will always have a trade-off of giving incentives to liquidators (i.e., increasing the stability) vs collecting liquidation penalty. So i do not see it as something unique to B.Protocol integration. How can you have 110% collateral ratio when penalty is 13%? Even if penalty is only 10%, then likely most auctions will end below collateral value. So imo the question is if Maker community believe that lower CR will help collect more stability fees or not. EDIT: the comment about opening Maker to other experimental framework, and other competitors is very legit. It should be noted that here we propose to take the implementation, bootstrapping, and part of the risk on ourselves. If there are more projects standing in line with such value proposition, I would definitely recommend Maker to experiment with them as well. ",

Research and Development. Again, ultimately it would be best if our time and resources with this proposal did make us some DAI, but I think there\u2019s a lot of valuable information to be learned by testing committed liquidators. While some aspects of Black Thursday have been addressed, we still have the underlying issue of needing keepers to act when gas prices are potentially sky high and everyone is focused on protecting their bag. In B. Protocol\u2019s proposal the committed liquidator has to post a significant amount of DAI into a special \u201cvault\u201d where all bad vaults are immediately liquidated to. It is up to them to figure out how to liquidate the bad positions in a turbulent market and if they are unable to do so their \u201cvault\u201d would turn bad and be put through our standard liquidation practice (with significantly more collateral in it than just the other bad vaults). Just as intended, it\u2019s a backstop that keeps our system safer and we would be compensating them for taking that risk Community partnerships. We are already the first to partner with B.Protocol and this represents a chance to test expanding our relationship with them. The marketing power and extra eyes on the innovation at Maker would be a breath of fresh air to the twitterverse. Improving Oracle uses. Our current oracles are set up for safety of the system and to counteract flash attacks. This is extremely important, but does not lend itself well to leveraged vaults. @NikKunkel and the team will no doubt be able to come up with something that works great for us, but this is a chance to offload some of the dev work for leveraged vaults onto B.Protocol at a time when we are already overworked on projects.  Overall the TL;DR is that this proposal has a lot of secondary benefits to it, and by engaging in s test run we have the chance to see if we can offer move leveraged products safely and if B.Protocol is the partner to help us do so.

If it is such a good business to participate in Maker liquidations, why barely 3 people participate in auctions? (if you filter it by the entity who claim the auction proceeds, and not tx sender, as one bot will use several senders). If it is such a good business why no one participated in the auctions during black Thursday? It is a good business to do flash loans and arbitrage on uniswap, while having 0 capital, but this is not a real backstop, and will not scale to acompete with the CeFi lending platforms (who do billions in fees). You can read more here about why big DeFi traders don\u2019t participate in current DeFi liquidations. ",
