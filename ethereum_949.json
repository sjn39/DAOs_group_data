We would like to do some changes that will help AllCoreDevs and Ethereum Community - FEM (Magicians). We already updated New Member Guide - renamed it into \u201cNew Member Guide 2.0\u201d - you can find it in Scrolls - it\u2019s a guide for new members who will join us (Ethereum Magicians), explaining basic terms that we are using on this forum. We will update \u201cWelcome\u201d Please README first!\" pinned post to this forum with more updated info. We will work more closely with Ethereum Cat Herders and publish more articles regarding to ETH1.x and other important topics that are missing. More to that soon but we will publish an article explaining the roles of Ethereum Magicians and Ethereum Cat Herders very soon. We started to work on creating a new landing page for Ethereum Magicians where we will publish a history of Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, FAQs, and more. We will start fundraising for Operations, coordination, and event organizing soon and for upgrading EIP process but more to this later. We are planning to have Ethereum Magicians sessions at EthCC in Paris but we will start to coordinate that later (December or early January) Just wanted to update you guys  ",

No we have other things to work on, EthCC is not a priority now. I shared this post to a forum just to inform the community that we are working on improving the forum  ",
