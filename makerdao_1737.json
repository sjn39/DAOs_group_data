Is it submitted, verified, and accepted by the Trust, Trustee, Sygnum and CB? I ask because I see all it takes is 2 names, signatures, and dates. How does the trust, better yet Sygnum and Coinbase know/verify any changes and verify that such changes are authorized by MKR token owners? Besides the need to do a video conference by the two individuals and the language proposed on such document \u2014 can you please walk us through how this document protects MKR token owners from rogue actors.

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate So the Maker Resolution is as close as we can get - at this moment - to basically write a \u201cprogram\u201d that the MIP65 structure will, unambiguously, execute. The intent is to create complete clarity for MKR holders in respect of what MKR holders are agreeing to have executed within the MIP65 trust structure. I hope you can see that benefit with Maker Resolutions. Then comes the question of how have we setup the MIP65 structure \u201cmachinery\u201d to ensure that it can only execute exactly that detailed Maker Resolution MKR holders have voted for. To make that happen we have put in place a good number of legal, structural and physical measures. Let me try to outline the process and its constraints:   The director of the trustee (riverfront - a legal entity under SHRM Group that is a professional trustee and administrator service) is required to ONLY execute based upon Maker Resolutions passed by Maker Governance and validated by Maker Committee. So when this \u201cMaker Resolution paper\u201d reach the director they must check online that the vote has passed and ensure that the Maker Committee members have approved it. (this requirement is in the legal docs).   Now given these two items are OK, the director can now start executing according to the Maker Resolution. But - importantly - it can\u2019t do so without approvals from the Fiduciary Group (which is part of another professional trustee and fund administrator group named Hatstone). And Fiduciary Group is required to check all actions proposed by Riverfront against the Maker Resolution. (again this is a requirement in the legal docs).   This requirement has further been physically setup in the transaction services that actually does something with the money - i.e. any transactions in Coinbase and Bank Sygnum requires physically the approval of both Riverfront and Fiduciary group.   On top of that we have worked with Bank Sygnum and Coinbase to constrain the action-set within these platforms materially such that even with the above \u201ctwo set of legal entity approvals\u201d, they can only perform actions that are in scope of MIP65. (as encoded in the Bank Sygnum letter). And whenever possible automatic actions have been setup in the systems (i.e. Coinbase has a function that automatically converts USDC to USD when the USDC hits a wallet). In addition for certain larger transactions Bank Sygnum would be required to see the transaction be matched up with an appropriate Maker Resolution.   Also you have Monetalis acting as Reporting Agent and is informed by the transaction services and can of course engage with Maker for immediate actions (note that all parties: hatstone, SHRM etc can all be immediately removed and replaced by a Maker Resolution).   This - in totality - we think - creates a strong process where MKR holders have very detailed control over what they want the structure to do - and can safely expect the structure to indeed do so. Now - we are already in development of a V2 of this. As we worked with the transaction platforms it became clear that many of them actually provide substantive API\u2019s that in fact allows even complex transaction flow across multiple platforms to be tied together and programmed. So in V2 we expect some of these transaction flows to be basically programs with parameters and a MKR vote should ideally start the execution of one of these programs with the MKR desired set parameters. I hope this explanation helps? ",

When the James Asset structure was designed and set up, the  Act (at that time in draft mode) was evaluated and it was concluded that the Act would not capture the structure\u2019s activities. Notwithstanding the initial review, as the final version of the Act came into force earlier this year it was prudent to gain a more formal understanding of the structure\u2019s status in respect of this Act. Appleby - a global law firm with offices in the BVI - have reviewed the situation and delivered the following memorandum (now also stored permanently above in the MIP65 HQ post). It concludes that \u201c\u200b\u200b[t]he Trustee would not be subject to the VASP Act and therefore does not require to be registered as a VASP.\u201d Memo on BVI Act - Appleby - 10/3/2023 Given the conclusions of the Memorandum, we will NOT be proposing that Maker Governance instructs the Trustee to undertake a registration and licensing for the VASP Act.
