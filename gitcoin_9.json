So from recruiting, to onboarding, to retention - I want people to feel excited about whatever may be next. Perhaps great experiences in web3 is a public good??

What attracted me to Gitcoin is it\u2019s democratically-based experimentation around public goods funding and flat organizational structure. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019re doing here, and believe that if we move quickly and with focus, we will create a truly impactful model for digital and IRL community organization and service.

I have a background in mechanical engineering and career development at a university, and have done people-y things for various organizations, including other DAOs. I\u2019m very excited about the regen web3 space - it\u2019s basically what makes me get up in the morning - and I\u2019m excited to help grow the space by building community-centric hiring processes and structures for Gitcoin DAO.

As a tradbiz refugee and reformed capitalist, I am passionate about finding new paths for business, people, and communities to grow together equitably. I found my way to Gitcoin as I worked with Mitz over at Index Coop and she mentioned I should look into Gitcoin given I was doing a ton of Governance & people work at Index.  Turns out, I already have a lot of friends here  I find part of the magic of web3 is the forkability of opensource processes & technology.  Anything we can do to determine which problems need to be solved, channel resources into solving those problems, and make the solutions easy for others to reapply - is worth our energy.  I think the DAO experiment can change the world, and I am here to nudge it that direction. ",
