Im wondering if the floor of 5k should be changed to 10k \u2026 because a malicious vote by the miners to 5k would render the chain unusable, so it itself is kind of an attack vector. ",

The limit should be governed by miners (soon stakers), who actually produce and validate blocks. If those validators leave slow clients behind, that is fine with me. Clients should be competing on performance, and not be holding back the protocol. As evidenced by the 15m proposal, they are really bad at setting such limits. If you had asked them a few months ago they would have set it at 12.5m. An earlier iteration of EIP-1559 would have set it to 10m. Worse, failure to reach consensus on a future increase would ossify 15m forever (see Bitcoin Core). ",

                    "content": "I have a few quibbles with the EIP. Firstly, the EIP currently does not specify what happens if, at block N, the gas limit is greater than 30m by a sufficient margin that it cannot be lowered below 30m. The literal reading of the EIP is that it is not possible to create a legal successor block in those circumstances, which is obviously undesirable. Secondly, I would appreciate some discussion about the fact that this is a highly contentious issue that is being implemented by a soft fork. While I expect the probability of the chain splitting over this is remote, if it does the situation could get quite unpredictable and confusing if some users refuse to upgrade to clients supporting the EIP in protest. More generally, I am not convinced that the current mechanism is broken in a way that justifies changing it in a hurry. EGL is unlikely to succeed at it\u2019s goals anyway and I would be mildly concerned about the potential for ACD to get bogged down in rows over the gas limit if it is given that power. If there is a more formal process for control I would support calls for more in depth investigations about the gas limit. ",

The alternative is override the normal gas limit manipulation mechanisms on the fork block and allow the miner to choose 30mm regardless of what the limit was in the parent block.  The second option can only be done via a hard fork and so I think we will want to discuss the trade offs between the two. ",

If the thought is that developer consensus (backstopped by the need to persuade users to run the fork the developers recommend) is just a better way to handle this than staker voting then that needs justifying, given the history of that method of controlling this particular parameter leading to stagnation and/or economic forks. If the goal is to mitigate the damage in the event that staker voting suddenly starts failing for some reason then there are probably better ways to do it; For example, you might want to put a cap on the medium-term rate of increase - for example say that the limit should not double in less than three months. That way if staker voting suddenly starts to malfunction and it looks like a developer-led hard fork is required then there\u2019s some time to do it before the chain becomes unusable, but you avoid routinely sucking core devs\u2019 time into endlessly arguing about it, and you also avoid the stagnation that\u2019s likely to occur if you require consensus on an issue about which different teams disagree.
