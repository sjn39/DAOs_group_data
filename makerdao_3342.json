It is a bit clunky but it works. Had the design been just a little different, instead of an order book it had been an AMM imagine the powerhouse Maker would be today. It almost wouldnt be fair. Building Oasis was a massive effort. But the code is there now for an AMM dex. Why not build an official Maker version? Liquidity would be hard to come by but with some clever incentives the volume could be slowly increased. ",

                    "GPT-summary": "The author is proposing that Maker should build its own AMM (Automated Market Maker) decentralized exchange. The author explains that Maker already built the first decentralized exchange on Ethereum, Oasisdex, and suggests that if it had been designed as an AMM instead of an order book, Maker would be even more successful. The author suggests that Maker could slowly increase volume with clever incentives. A third party gives constructive criticism by suggesting that Maker should focus on its core business of stablecoins and not get distracted by building an AMM. Another third party extends the proposal by suggesting that Maker could collaborate with an existing AMM instead of building its own.",
