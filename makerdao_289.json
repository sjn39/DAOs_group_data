Please see below for the attempted email.  Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Hi. Yesterday, I transferred 690.895995426699955508 DAI to Crypto.org wallet address\u2026 0xa32e8a897ed4b07083c4cfcd235b160b14c7adad. The transaction hash on Polygon Scan shows that the transaction was successful. You can click here for more details. Less than a minute later however, it shows that it went to the Maker Dao address: 0x4c9df57276dc17dee5635ded208c07b0be32afd0 - you can click here for more information. I didn\u2019t make this transfer myself. The transfer also doesn\u2019t appear in my Crypto.org as a transaction. It\u2019s almost as if it disappeared into thin air. I need to know and understand why this was transferred. Was it a hack? Or was this intentional? I didn\u2019t conduct or approve the second transaction (only the first transaction to Crypto.com) I have already discussed this with Polygon and Crypto.com - they both directed me to contact your team. Please help, asap. This has been over a day\u2019s worth of inconvenience. Thank you. \u2013 Chat Soon, Alex ",

Secondly, in the TXID you pass you don\u2019t notice any transfer of any assets. It could be my mistake and it is just a working contract. What you may have seen is that when you transfer an asset and it is properly documented by the browser it will show you the contract on that network, \u201cremember DAI does not support DAI on Polygon\u201d DAI only exists natively on Ethereum.  image1304\u00d7669 64.8 KB  talk well with Crypto.com team, take it easy and formulate your requirements a bit better, so we can help you here or there.

I\u2019ve got to say this has been a bad experience for the past 72 hours.  One day, I talked to them for 14.5 hours straight beginning at 6am in the morning. They finally agreed to refund the money, but told me that they would take 100 USDC to approve the refund.  When I asked for proof of policy, they told me that it was up to me if I wanted my refund or not.  I gave them the 100 USDC, they took it from my account\u2026 then never returned the money.  I followed up with them 3 times\u2026 and they just keep saying that there\u2019s no timeline or ETA. Feel free to illustrate my experience when talking with them.  And it this point, I\u2019m starting to feel they need to take the problem to other platforms. Good Luck!!! ",
