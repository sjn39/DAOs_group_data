I wonder if there are a set of things for a community developer to help - be it smart contract testing, prototyping work etc. I am currently in between gigs so I do have quite a bit of time to learn and help. As background, I previously did enterprise backend develpoment with the JVM stack. I\u2019d love to learn more solidity to help and get my feet wet contributing in Maker and Ethereum. Thanks, ",
