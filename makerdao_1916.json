                    "content": "Forum post published as part of the MOMC. This communication doesn\u2019t represent the view of the committee members individually, nor should it be taken as any kind of recommendation. All simulations are for illustration only. The whole point is to trigger a discussion. Authors, the MOMC: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi  Summary We propose that MakerDAO governance considers increasing the DSR. Given that MIP65, GUSD partnership and soon MIP81 will give us access to TradFi safe yield or rewards, we have all the tools to generate sustainable revenues at scale. It makes sense to consider raising the DSR to distribute some of this revenue to DAI holders who are currently earning nothing. On one hand, increasing DSR would improve DAI utility, and possibly volume outstanding. On the other hand, this would be a significant cost for MakerDAO.  Competitive landscape In the tradfi world, the risk-free benchmark is SOFR which currently stands at 3.8%. Coinbase is now offering 1.5% on all USDC deposits at their platform. We recognize that it is custodial and not suitable for everyone, creating some friction\u2026 Meanwhile DAI offers 0.01% in its DSR product that is not used (not even proposed on Oasis).  Due to the rapidly increasing spread between yield that can be obtained in DeFi and the risk-free yield in TradFi, we are seeing outflows to USD increasing as people move to capture the higher yields outside of DeFi.  1600\u00d71412 194 KB  We expect this trend to accelerate as the spreads between DeFi and TradFi continue to increase which will create an incentive for holders to exit crypto to earn a risk-free yield.  The opportunity Assuming a native risk-free yield would be a strong value proposition, as no fiat-backed stablecoin would be able to provide a permissionless on-chain yield. Moreover, both Compound and Aave have DSR integration that are currently deactivated but could be activated easily. Assuming a 2% DSR, the lending rate on Compound would move from 1.20% to 2.25%, significantly higher than USDC. Currently, on the 638M DAI deposited at Compound, 302M are lent at around 3% and the rest earn nothing. With a DSR this rest would earn the DSR rate improving the Compound lending rate for DAI. In such a case, only half of the DAI lent at Compound would be using the DSR as the rest is borrowed (in such a case a cost of 1.05% instead of 2% for the $638M lent on Compound).  998\u00d7197 19.7 KB  We could expect that such a move would incentivize USDC holders to migrate to lend DAI instead. This could improve the DAI position in DeFi protocols. We could also improve our situation the Dex space as CHAI (or another name for the ERC20 on top of the DSR) would provide more utility to be used in the stable-ETH LP pairs, improving the liquidity of DAI (1inch incorporate the DAI<->CHAI conversion).  Example of Asset/Liability Management For all the proposals, we will assume Blocktower, RFA and MIP81 are implemented. We will consider that beyond 200M USDC in the PSM, the remaining will be put on MIP81 (assuming a smart contract implementation which doesn\u2019t add risks). A permissionless smart contract will keep the PSM around 200M USDC of liquidity. Therefore, in total it would be 200M in PSM-USDC-A, 500M in PSM-GUSD-A (of which actual liquidity usage remains to be tested) and 1300M in MIP81 (at the current exposure). If MIP81 should not work/be continued, the GUSD partnership would provide similar benefits. We will set MIP65 DC at 33% of the total assets of MakerDAO. With the current balance sheet of 5,700M DAI, it means 1,881M. We expect to add other similar short-term bonds platforms like Backed or MIP90 going forward to diversify the risk. Therefore, for both the stablecoin and the public credit bucket, we would have some backup/diversification in place. We will use a simple ALM model that can be found here. The assets of MakerDAO would be represented by the following allocation:  Assuming our balance sheet grows to 20B DAI thanks to the attractiveness of DAI+DSR, we would keep 33% exposure to public credit (MIP65-like products, IB01, very short duration, only) but increase significantly stablecoins holdings (most in MIP81). Therefore, liquidity wouldn\u2019t be an issue.  For the simulations, we will assume participation rate to the DSR of 100% for EoA (externally owned addresses) and lending protocol (Aave and Compound mainly) and 0% for other smart contracts (which, to our knowledge, don\u2019t implement the DSR). This gives a 65% participation rate. Any additional DAI would be considered using the DSR. Therefore the participation rate will increase if the DSR attracts people. It is unlikely that all current EoA DAI holders will use the DSR so we think we are overestimating cost here.  Net protocol income simulation We provide below the simulation of the Net protocol income (after workforce expenses) for different DSR rate and balance sheet size. It is obviously unrealistic to assume that with the current DSR more people will be attracted to DAI (hence the numbers are in gray). Assuming the DSR attracts some capital, having such a cost would actually increase the Net Protocol Income.     DSR / DAI 5,700 (today) 10,000 20,000 50,000     0% 98 198 431 1,128   1% 61 118 251 648   2% 25 39 71 169    * All numbers in M USD  Things to take in considerations If the DSR is activated, it is important to make sure that DSR is inferior to the minimal Stability Fee. Otherwise, that would just be a loss making yield faring opportunity for the benefit of the farmers. While it would increase vanity metrics like DAI outstanding, it wouldn\u2019t represent organic usage. Comments from the community of this item are welcome.  Next steps In our view, MakerDAO should start a discussion on those topics today as they are of prime importance. If Maker Governance decides on it, we suggest that it should start after the payment rails for MIP81, GUSD and MIP65 are verified, this should be in January. ",

It\u2019s an interesting question in terms of how the protocol can best accelerate growth during a bear. However, I\u2019m not sure why allocating money to CUs would be a better way of \u201cbuilding in the ecosystem of Maker\u201d compared to the direct benefit of attracting capital through an operative DSR. Given the protocol is about to make a lot more money, it would be strange to funnel all of that revenue into staffing rather than return value to DAI holders and improve the protocol\u2019s competitive positioning. With the FTX dumpster fire continuing to smoulder away, a lot of capital will be sitting on the sidelines nervously wondering what they can trust anymore. If Maker can offer permisionless on-chain yield in that kind of context, we\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better value proposition. ",

If though it is raised, we will support it as part of Oasis Earn as one of the products straight away. On Savings Dai, I 100% agree here - even prior to MCD launch, we were trying to get it called Savings Dai for Oasis back then, but alas - we got as far as Oasis Save and it was very very popular product back around MCD launch ",

I don\u2019t see a reason to wait for all collateral to be fully deployed, as long as we know it\u2019s happening soon we can afford to start attracting/retaining users asap. Post-endgame the way DSR should be handled beyond whatever ad hoc process we come up with now (most likely facilitator governance powers is the only option available), is through the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework. It would be helpful to think about whatever rules or approach we come up with now in terms of how it could evolve into a more permanent, scalable and automated rule set for the longer term that is possible to implement through the scope framework.

MKR can\u2019t really compete with current treasury yields.  What has been good to see is how sticky DAI has been despite having no DSR.  I kind of want to see how strong that demand is and take advantage of it to strengthen the balance sheet until it\u2019s clear tradfi rates are actually drawing away the stablecoin backed DAI.  There\u2019s still too much of an imbalance right now and I think we should wait for a lower supply before activiating DSR (plus it would be cheaper and you could have higher rates).  So basically IMO, profitability should be prioritized.  That said, it\u2019s easier to keep DAI demand than draw it so I\u2019d definitely want a process to activate this quickly if demand does start to flag. ",
