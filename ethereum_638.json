Ethereum Improvement Proposals   Reward clients for a sustainable network Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.      Changelog  Update: I made modifications to the proposal, adding a background for the abstract, additional details for the motivation, specification and rationale (while leaving the proposed implementation unchanged), plus references to similar EIPs such as EIP 960 and EIP 1015. Update 2: I added more details to how the access list for client addresses could be managed (off-chain or layer 2). Update 3: added more details to the spec and rationale with specific reward amounts proposed and more details on how it would work. remove a proposal to reward full nodes, leaving just the proposal to reward clients, because Casper FFG will incentivize validation. add an attack and solution.

A validator that also signs invalid blocks would get penalized. Before PoS forcing a new node to accept a false state would require a 51% attack, assuming a simple rule like \u2018only download state that\u2019s at least 1 day old\u2019 (no idea if it already exists), which is a failure condition anyway. PoS also gives a collective incentive to validators to support the network by providing an uploading bandwidth. Theoretically it\u2019s a free-rideable public good but I would expect most validators to support the network. ",
