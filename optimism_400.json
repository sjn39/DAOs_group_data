Gonna.eth:  a strong case against   The best argument is math (and experience)) We can look at this idea in perspective, any delegate who redistributes voting power to other people will discredit themselves.

Why not, I love ideas, research and experiments: each delegate, regardless of voting power, 1M, 100k or 10k, can determine the effect of this idea on himself, as many people do not have either 10k or 1k voting power OP, as an idea, Dhannte you have 80k+ voting power, redelegate 70k to 7 people who do not have this voting power, as you mentioned, \u2018to create a more diverse community and point of view\u2019 and based on this experience each delegate will personally decide if it is an idea that can be implemented. ***But consider that there were people who wrote in support, and wanted to delegate their tokens specifically to you.

                    "content": "I like the idea of encouraging delegate diversification, but I feel that delegates sub-delegating might not be the best way to go. People select a delegate for their experience and opinions, and while we expect the sub-delegate to be someone with views aligned with them, this alignment most likely won\u2019t be for 100% of issues (if it is, then in the end it\u2019s not really helping with diversification). Also, if the delegate handpicks their sub-delegate, even if they don\u2019t sub-delegate to themselves it\u2019s likely that they will delegate someone close to their circle, thus really not solving the decentralisation issue. However, as @diligit already mentioned, Programmes like the Protocol Delegates are an interesting idea, and perhaps the Token House could have a diverse set of delegates by having similar  specific delegate positions for other niches. Maybe we could use a delegate\u2019s \u2018Voting surplus\u2019 to delegate towards these niche delegators? This however contradicts the ongoing discussion of respecting the token holder\u2019s delegation, so I don\u2019t think it could work. Another idea (although probably not the best) could be removing/filtering delegates above a threshold from the delegates frontend page. This threshold can be higher than what the ideal delegated amount is to avoid people being barely filtered out and then undelegated (so for example, the \u2018soft cap\u2019 is 500k OP, but to be filtered out you\u2019d need more than 600k). I feel this idea could work to limit the growth of delegates with too much voting power, but it\u2019ll need a considerable amount more of delegating activity to fix itself over time. Really interested to see what other ideas come up here, I feel this issue is common in most governance with delegates so I wanna see how this goes  ",
