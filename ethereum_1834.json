I want to make an ERC about it, with this, guys can communicate with any one by EOA address. NO one can block it. it\u2019s better solution than normal p2p comunication. I have read EIP1, and konw that I need to first post a thread in the forum to review my idea, but I wonder how detailed to describe it. I have read some similar proposals, like EIP-2848, I think mine is a new idea. Hope to get some suggestions. Thanks in advance ",
