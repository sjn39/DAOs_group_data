Look at what is happening with the USD right now. The ten year keeps tracking up and the fed is not really doing much to stop it. The dollar is slowly losing ground as the worlds reserve currency as well as the US is losing the number 1 GDP spot. What is wrong with at least developing a contingency plan to transition to a multi-currency index tracking Dai if needed? Or maybe just give us the choice between several different Dai all tracking different major currencies? Seems to me the the idea of a stablecoin would be most stable if it tracked a more decentralized network of currencies instead of just one. ",

This was abaonded for two primary reasons: (1) No one wants to borrow in a currency they can\u2019t actually use. Most things are denominated in USD and that\u2019s what borrowers want as their unit of account. (2) Since everything is priced in USD (damn petrodollar!), the SDR is more often than not less stable than the USD relative to baskets of goods and services ",
