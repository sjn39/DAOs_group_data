                    "content": "Summary I am a core contributor at Fei Protocol and would like to initiate a community discussion on creating a FEI PSM to further diversify DAI collateral with the addition of a decentralized USD stablecoin. We have discussed this initiative with Maker Growth and Risk teams, and are inviting feedback from the Maker community to help us move it forward. At present, DAI is 26.7% collateralized by USDC and 50.8% generated by USDC, which creates a substantial regulatory risk in the Maker protocol. To move forward confidently, DeFi must strive to be decentralized and permissionless. Since it would be beneficial for Maker to reduce the existing USDC exposure, we believe FEI is a safe and decentralized stablecoin to collateralize DAI. FEI\u2019s strength is based on its liquidity and decentralized collateral base. In addition to helping stabilize the price between FEI and DAI, some use cases of a FEI PSM include the Fei DAO utilizing the PSM to market make FEI-DAI. For example, our DAO could use FEI to mint DAI, and provide additional liquidity to the existing Gelato UniV3 FEI-DAI pair, or other platforms like Curve and/or Balancer. Currently, Fei\u2019s Protocol Controlled Value (PCV), is backed by all decentralized assets, including: ETH (81.64%), stETH (9.3%), DAI (6.3%), RAI (1.2%), DPI (1.1%), INDEX (.46%) As part of our proposed partnership with Maker, the Fei DAO intends to use the PSM to diversify the PCV further. It has already opened a bonding curve for 50m in DAI supplied to Compound, with pending proposals about expanding it to up to 150m DAI. Real time FEI analytics can be viewed here and here.  7DE_xJVxv34B0Dr_ZkGDrh7tBIlWRfQOseKG3BFDOEZx1to5D9on_iGpC9ux57usfIfVMkLOwY5OXnt5pf9pKy8o0Q_sMQGTz1Gm6MY220D8gaHBximuFYBq0IXn7zPJm2048\u00d7960 78.1 KB  In an upcoming FIP (Fei Improvement Proposal), the community will also vote on disabling the burner role. Our DAO is eager to work with Maker, and use the PSM, helping grow DAI. We also had a great call with the Maker Oracle team @NikKunkel , and plan to use their oracles. Motivation Stablecoins play an important and ever growing role within the DeFi ecosystem, and community sentiment shows more concerns due to centralization and censorship of the largest stablecoins. FEI is one of the most scalable and decentralized stablecoin in DeFi. Use of FEI in the PSM would help reduce reliance on centralized assets, while providing a highly stable and growing diversification asset. Adding FEI PSM would also help reinforce DAI\u2019s decentralization ethos. Specification / Proposal Details The key components of the proposal are listed below. The proposal for the debt ceiling is based on a previous Maker Proposal, per a discussion with @monet-supply , which starts conservatively with plans to increase over time. #1 Add FEI Support to Maker PSM  Debt Ceiling: $125M (25% of total circulating supply) Fee in (tin): 10bps Fee out (tout): 0bps  ",

Couple questions:   Given that FEI isn\u2019t always exactly at $1 USD, what makes this appropriate for a PSM rather than a new form of collateral? Maybe this is good for collecting arbitrage fees on our side, though, as long as it\u2019s a narrow band and in both directions?   Building off number 1, the market cap is (for the moment) fairly light. I see how we can stabilize your peg, but between slight deviations and smaller size, has anyone on your side or ours tried to estimate whether this can move (or not move!) the peg for DAI?   There\u2019s some DAI backing FEI. How do we account for this? Do we need to get FEI to agree to some kind of covenant not to let DAI exceed a percentage of their own collateral? Open questions and would love to hear thoughts from anyone on either side.   Given the trajectory of USDP, would FEI be upset if 1/3 or more of its issuance ended up inside our PSM? I can see that as a feature or a bug for you, and just curious what y\u2019all think of it.   ",

When we introduce a PSM, we\u2019re assuming that the token in the PSM is more likely to stay pegged to $1 than DAI. With USDC and PAX, this is reasonable because those tokens can always be exchanged with a centralized entity for $1 all the time. This is not the case with FEI. Secondly, while we are exposed more heavily to USDC than we\u2019d like, exposing ourselves to another stablecoin should only be done if that stablecoin\u2019s ability to stay pegged, not get blacklisted, etc. is at least comparable to USDC. Diversification is good but only when the alternative option is as good and secure as USDC. Unfortunately, FEI\u2019s mechanism has not been tested sufficiently and the protocol is too new to make this claim. Here\u2019s FEI\u2019s entire history (six months).  Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 12.45.42 PM1396\u00d7848 50.4 KB  I find the risk too high to introduce a FEI PSM with the data we have so far and what we know about FEI\u2019s mechanism. ",

AstronautThis:  I find the risk too high to introduce a FEI PSM with the data we have so far and what we know about FEI\u2019s mechanism.   IF MakerDAO\u2019s goal is to only add assets with strictly greater than or equal to USDC in terms of peg and Lindy that would invalidate pretty much all other decentralized options. Totally respect that viewpoint if that is the case, and FEI would not make much sense to add. However, I want to clarify some things about the data to enhance the argument as to why FEI is both secure enough and brings meaningful value to MakerDAO.  The v1 peg mechanism did not work as you can see from the chart. We migrated to effectively a 1:1 redeemability model in June, with a current global collateralization ratio of over 300%. This has led to the tight peg seen recently. Impressive considering the almost exclusively volatile-asset collateral base (no Fei-equivalent to a PSM) Fei V2 will be announced soon and released in the coming months, further improving on the existing mechanisms and managing tail risk. MakerDAO and. DAI can play a huge role in this upgrade. Fei provides trading fees, decentralization, and DAI liquidity for the relatively small risk incurred by the capped exposure.  Basically MakerDAO would be helping the FEI peg plus issuing a line of credit in exchange for these benefits. I\u2019m personally excited about the potential here and think FEI would be a logical add for MakerDAO. ",

Therefore having a 125M FEI-PSM is extending a $125M credit exposure to FEI. If we abstract the details, both protocols can provide such a facility with a Uniswap V3 pool. You have 52M of $DAI and an infinite amount of $FEI for that. We have an infinite amount of $DAI. the real question is who should do it and who really needs it? I can see why having a tight peg is of strategic importance for FEI. But it\u2019s not really a problem for MakerDAO. Moreover, you have all the tools to make it happen. You could even do a 1:1 exchange rate (as you can use the DAI on Aave Compound to generate fees). 125M is quite a big credit exposure (2.5x our equity buffer) to a new protocol that is quite leveraged and yet it does not achieve much on our side in terms of reducing the USDC-PSM. On the other hand, you can easily have a 125M credit exposure to Maker (and it would provide you 50% of your stablecoin liquidity). You can even profit by putting it to work on money markets. ",

In instances of large market drawdown demand for dai would further increase as vaults want to repay their debt - in such cases reliable PSMs are crucial to match the sudden demand for dai and prevent an even larger dai premium. Since FEI itself is vulnerable to large market drawdowns as it can become undercollateralized, I don\u2019t think it is suitable as a PSM asset.  I also want to point out that the statements made in this post are contradicting each other, at least from how I see it. USDC backing dai presents a substantial regulatory risk, and to move forward confidently, DeFi must be decentralized and permissionless; and decentralized stablecoin FEI is going to reduce it, while FEI itself wants to increase its exposure to dai and therefore increase its own exposure to centralized assets.

                    "content": "I\u2019m glad to see so much engagement from the Maker community because adding FEI is not strictly positive, its more of a give-and-take arrangement in terms of the benefits to each side. I largely agree that this integration is early, and given our upcoming v2 we will focus on that rollout and come back to MakerDAO after a successful launch in a few months. I\u2019ll go ahead and address many of your concerns here:  Adding FEI to the PSM will stabilize FEI not DAI:  This is not in dispute at all. By adding a non-zero spread MakerDAO would profit off of FEI volatility in exchange for this extra stabilization. Framing this as a \u201cpeg stability benefit\u201d to MakerDAO is incorrect, even though the name is PSM.     LongForWisdom:  How does this model work in practice? Are there docs available? Why is this only effectively 1:1 redeemability?   We plan on announcing V2 very soon and updating our docs accordingly. FEI will be redeemable for PCV collateral with a spread (50bps in the case of ETH). This part of V2 is currently live on-chain.     LongForWisdom:  How will V2 related to V1? Is the token changing? The stabilization mechanisms?   The token is not changing, it is mostly an additive upgrade for managing the scenarios where PCV is undercollateralized and algorithmically rebalancing asset allocations.     LongForWisdom:  Assuming FEI does have a robust 1:1 redemption mechanism that allows it to keep its price, it might be worth increasing the out fee in order to keep it in the protocol given that we need (decentrally backed) supply.   This seems totally reasonable     LongForWisdom:  Feels like guarantees as to the backing in the future would be important as well. Will FEI always be overcollateralized? Would DAI be kept below some percentage? What other assets would you consider adding? How does FEI recover from an event that leaves it less than 100% collateralized?   FEI will always be collateralized over a governance controlled-target which will likely be 100% but could be slightly lower. DAI can be kept below a certain percentage. Any ERC20 is open to be added by TRIBE holders. PCV would algorithmically shift towards stablecoins as it gets closer to 100% collateralized, and if it gets under then TRIBE will inflate similar to MKR.     rema:  while FEI itself wants to increase its exposure to dai and therefore increase its own exposure to centralized assets.   To be clear, Maker adding FEI would both decrease the centralization of DAI and increase the centralization of FEI. I see this as the clearest mirror to FEI gaining additional stability at the expense of additional risk for MakerDAO. The Fei community is actively deepening its usage of LUSD and RAI as collateral. DAI is currently the most liquid and trusted decentralized stablecoin, but other alternatives are growing fast.     swakya:  Are there alternatives to a full blown PSM?   A full-blown PSM would make the most sense given that FEI is a stablecoin and demand would be almost 0 for a normal vault.     AstronautThis:  I encourage you to start a poll or even a signal request, if you\u2019d like to hear the broader community\u2019s opinion on a specific question.   We will aim to get a broader opinion as we roll out V2 to see if the Maker community has any interest at that time. Thanks everyone for the engagement so far! Truly impressed by the thoughtful and diverse perspectives being brought to the table ",

Or use the DAI you already hold to create a PSM? I guess I just don\u2019t see how this can either 1) support the peg for DAI, or 2) generate fees.

Talking about the price, I see FEI on a stable form, with its variations as every stablecoin, as a reference on the State of DAI we see DAI $0.95 and sometimes $1.05.  image800\u00d7373 43.8 KB  We see FEI on a more mature form. Now it has a $730 million TLV, where DAI has a  good participation there. It would be interesting if maker took a step ahead an integrates it to its PSM, since FEI has its own PSM to DAI and it has serve in a great way.         ",

                    "content": "Summary I am a Senior Product Manager at Paxos and lead our DeFi efforts. We propose extending Paxos Standard\u2019s [PAX] involvement in Maker through creating a PAX PSM to diversify DAI collateral and increase DAI trustworthiness.  We discussed this proposal with the Maker Growth team and welcome feedback from the community. DAI is 30% collateralized by USDC which creates a single point of failure in the Maker protocol. More than 60% of DAI is generated by USDC deposits. USDC has been coming under increasing regulatory and community pressure due to its treasury decisions; over 25% is non-government, third-party debt, which introduces liquidity, credit, and interest risk. Given it\u2019s beneficial for Maker to reduce USDC exposure, we believe PAX is the safest and most practical stablecoin to collateralize DAI due to its liquidity, scale, transparency and regulation. PAX is 100% backed either by US dollars held in fully segregated, bankruptcy remote accounts at insured depository institutions or in short term government securities (i.e. US Treasury Bills). Monthly attestations which can be found on our website. Both Paxos and PAX are regulated by a prudential regulator, the NYDFS. This regulation makes PAX more secure in that we are better positioned in the event of potential US stablecoin regulations because PAX has a prudential regulator, unlike other leading stablecoins. As part of our proposed partnership with Maker, we plan to add DAI support on our platform, which means that Paxos Crypto Brokerage institutional clients (eg PayPal, Venmo, Revolut, etc) will be able to offer DAI to their end users. Motivation Stablecoins play an important role in DeFi, and the community is growing concerned that the lack of trustworthiness of the largest stablecoins creates substantial risk for the future growth of crypto. PAX is the most trustworthy stablecoin and its use in the PSM will increase the trustworthiness of DAI while simultaneously diversifying risk to any one token. Specification / Proposal Details Below are the key components of the proposal. The tin, tout, and debt ceiling suggestions are based on a prior Maker Proposal. The proposal\u2019s motivation is to have other stablecoin tin be lower than USDC to incentivize diversification. However, we are open to widening the tin between USDC and other stablecoins, as 10bps may not be enough incentive for diversification. #1 Add PAX Support to Maker PSM  Debt Ceiling: $500M Fee in (tin): 10bps Fee out (tout): 0bps USDC tin: 20bps  #2 Add DAI Support to Paxos Platform By the end of Q1 2022 (if not sooner), Paxos will add DAI to the Paxos Platform, which unlocks the below user flows. We will focus first on DAI minting via PSM. We cannot contractually require any/all institutional clients (eg Revolut) to support DAI for their end users, but we can ensure DAI is an available stablecoin option.  User can swap supported fiat currencies for DAI using the PSM (if best market rate) User can custody DAI User can buy/sell crypto using DAI User can deposit/withdraw DAI  ",

This proposed spread is already quite aggressive considering what the PSMs are for. Once we confirm there will be uptake with Paxos, then I could see us adopting a more aggressive spread (temporarily) in order to balance out our \u201cforeign reserves.\u201d But if we make the spread between the two PSMs quite large, that risks affecting our peg if both PSMs aren\u2019t treated as interchangeable by the market for some reason. We definitely want to turn on the PAX PSM spigot, but can\u2019t risk deviations in the peg by turning off the USDC spigot until we know arbitrageurs are ready to use them both agnostically. ",

Reserves insufficient for Withdraws: In the event that a user could not withdraw USD because of insufficient reserves (eg tied up in illiquid or risky investments) then this would cause the token to break its peg. Note PAX is 100% backed by US Dollars or short term government securities so this will not happen.   Prolonged Operational Outage: In event that Paxos had an outage where users or market makers could not mint/burn PAX then the value of PAX could deviate. We have had to meet the reliability requirements of the largest financial institutions (eg PayPal, Bank of America) and also have manual processes in place to facilitate transactions if automated solutions fail.   Security Breach: If an entity breaches Paxos and illicitly minted PAX. However, in that event we have procedures to determine PAX token holders prior to attack and would take appropriate measures to ensure redemptions of the reserves could be enabled and/or seize the illegitimately minted PAX. Note Paxos has SOC I and SOC II certifications and has robust security protections / procedures.   ",

To be clear, this PSM (which I am 100% in favor of) reduces credit risk to Circle and also provides a powerful combination of the \u201cnext two\u201d stablecoin issuers, but does zero to reduce risk of blacklisting. If our USDC is ordered to be frozen because of a subpoena, you can know that our PAX will be as well. This PSM should be thought of as a really powerful tool for growth and branding. Our main risk with USDC (blacklisting) is not actually reduced here. One last time, though, this is a really, really powerful proposal that I think Maker and Paxos should both get a lot of use out of. ",

Today Paxos announced we are updating the Paxos Standard (PAX) name to Pax Dollar (USDP), with the primary motivation creating extra transparency to users that PAX is a digital dollar pegged to USD. The only fields we are updating in the contract are NAME and SYMBOL - rest of contract is unchanged. In preparation for the PAX PSM launch, the Protocol Core Engineering Unit is implementing an initial $50M initial debt ceiling, which is within the surplus buffer limit. It is expected debt ceiling will be ramped to $500M after initial launch. CC @brianmcmichael   Thanks, and feel free to ping with any questions! ",

This would be (if end of Q3) 12 months after they proposed listing DAI as part of the PSM proposal. They have shared a number of reasons for the moving deadlines; 1. re-evaluating their internal engineering roadmap 2. waiting on regulatory guidance from the NYDFS (which they are regulated by) as there is more scrutiny on stablecoins in general since the UST debacle.
