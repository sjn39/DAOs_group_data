I want to take a moment and tell you a few of Gitcoins experiments in crypto/culture/art and how they have become symbiotic with our mission. Longtime followers of Gitcoin may have noticed a different type of storytelling coming out of our orbit in the last year.  These projects - $SACKS, MoonshotBots, or The GreatestLARP - and other launches from GitcoinDAO or GitcoinDAO-adjacent groups have two goals:  Spread the narrative of Gitcoin\u2019s mission, and other friendly Moloch-fighting, Regenerative, Solarpunk, economies being built in the web3 space.

Why do this? We started producing these Gitcoin-adjacent tool as a way of exploring how to convey our mission & our culture to the outside world.  Each of these tools was a deeper way to engage an audience on our mission/culture.  instead of talking about community, we\u2019re now playing hackey sack and together experiencing it. instead of talking about ways we might fund open source, we\u2019re actually doing it. instead of talking about how someone should build a moloch slayer, we\u2019re meme-ing it into existence. instead of talking about how funding public goods is cool, we\u2019re creating the dopest merch + only giving it to public goods funders. instead of being resigned to doomerism, we\u2019re painting a picture of a Solarpunk world  As a rule, the more visceral the better.  Visceral can mean cold hard cash for public goods.  Visceral can mean aesthetically engaging.  Visceral means giving people experiences. Like David Hoffman from Bankless says, \u201cthe legacy of crypto will instead be a renaissance in human culture.\u201d.

Gitcoin-Grants Adjacent & GitcoinDAO Powered Gitcoin\u2019s primary assets are:  Gitcoin Grants - which has generated $20mm in public goods funding, but relies on continous matching pool funding to continue to operate. GitcoinDAO - a DAO that governs Gitcoin and is becoming the primary for it\u2019s culture, mission, ethos, and results.  This culture, fundraising, and meme-machine augments Gitcoin\u2019s existing assets:  it deepens & spreads the lore. it raises money for Quadratic Funding  Here\u2019s what it looks like:  bf7d6abb-c369-4d83-9db5-7152325101aa2210\u00d71242 205 KB  If we are can spin this flywheel, we can pull more & more people into the orbit of our mission  Screen Shot 2021-10-14 at 11.21.54 AM1096\u00d7864 65.8 KB   So where is this all going? First and foremost, i believe we need to focus on meat and potatoes.   Mission - deepening our understanding of our mission.  Culture - making sure that we are making time to focus on deliberately designing our DAO culture.  Results - turning the screws on our product/ops to make sure we actualize our mission as much as possible.  There are numerous ways that we can do that.  It\u2019s in everything we do.  Every Discord message we send.  Every zoom call.  Every tweet.  Every conference we attend.  Every project we execute.  Every idea we brainstorm. I cannot possibly contain all of the diverse & beautiful ways that we could do so in my head.  There are many options, and many of them are wworthy of being funded by the DAO.  One Direction we could go I see an opening for one direction this could all go. We get really good at transmedia storytelling.  We build a metaverse. This means creating a distributed content generation & fundraising machine.  Illustrations, Comic Books, Movie Clips, Stickers, Schwag.   Any medium is a possibility for building lore. One tangible step we could do is to ask different Ethereum community members to partner with us to launch Comics.  I\u2019m envisioning  The Raid Guild raids Molochs Lair! The CoordinAPEs coordinate to destroy Moloch! The AAAVE Ghosts vs Moloch.  In each of these stories, we\u2019d help share the diversity of what makes that community special, what their super powers are\u2026 We\u2019d catalogue own fights against Moloch, and add them to a larger narrative of the whole open web fighting Moloch together. After having produced a handful of NFTs, comics, and other transmedia goodies, we\u2019d have a few little saplings of what a GitcoinDAO Metaverse could look like. Plus I\u2019d get to start giving our Moloch-Comic-Box-Sets to everyone at conferences   Looking for Leaders None of this will happen unless the community decides it should. I\u2019m looking for dreamers & leaders who are inspired to make this a reality to join the GMC - the GitcoinDAO Metaverse Coordinators - a group dedicated to laying down pieces of this metaverse brick by brick, campaign by campaign, one fight against Moloch at a time.

The key pros for this were already summed up: i.e. that it will help spread Gitcoin\u2019s mission further and to many other communities, and it will raise additional funding for public goods. We could leverage on what is already built (1 and 2 editions comics, nfts and lore), combine it with some elements of some already successful projects. Just as a reference, (shoutout to user Erik Knobi for mentioning this) the MetaHeroes project (https://punkscomic.com) uses NFT comics, Metaverse NFT characters to build lore a whole universe around the story. AFAIK some NFTs are main story characters (in our case Anon of the 2nd comic edition could be the first) and other are just secondary roles (Maybe ethbots? moonshotbots? Sacks?). Once the 1st level of the Greatest Larp concludes, we could make 2nd Edition Comics (ETHBot wins) an NFT as well, and it having some extra perks for the future. Airdropping to MoonshotBots, Sacks and Ethbots holders could be an option. Another project called CyberKongz made VX models of their 2D NFT avatars https://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-vx which will be interoperable with the Sandbox. Imagine having these 3D models for moonshotbots and ethbots, Itd be pretty cool. There is much that could be done on this metaverse path, and fortunately much that has already been done and could be leveraged further. ",
