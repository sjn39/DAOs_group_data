If this proposal is ratified, the LINK collateral type will be added to the Maker Protocol allowing anyone to lock LINK in a Maker Vault to generate Dai. Proposal Details This subproposal contains the domain work products required for the LINK collateral asset to be added to the Maker Protocol. More specifically, it includes the risk parameters, oracle solutions, and the necessarily smart contracts required for the successful onboarding of LINK.   Risk Domain Work: The risk domain team\u2019s work contains the following risk assessment for the LINK collateral type:  [LINK] Risk Domain Team Assessment    Smart Contracts Domain Work: The smart contracts domain team\u2019s work required to get LINK added to the Maker Protocol includes an assessment of the general and technical information about the LINK token, a risk summary, formal verification considerations, audits & related documentation, a contract logic summary, administrative addresses, and lastly a contract risk summary.
