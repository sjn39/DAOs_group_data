Besides the media trying to take a hit a Maker, which I suppose is nothing new, there are some things in this article that had me curious.    AMBCrypto \u2013 23 Jul 22    MakerDAO stands at the mercy of bears as MKR slips below $1,000 in the last... On 18 July, MakerDAO\u2019s native token, MKR, rode the ongoing bull wave to mark its spot at a high of $1,043. However, this was followed by a retracement that sent the price of the token chasing new lows. With a 7% decline in price since 18 July, MKR...  Est. reading time: 4 minutes       As per the article, and I have not verified this by checking the wallets, \u201c[a] look at other on-chain metrics revealed a pattern of decline since 18 July. For example, a total of 131 new addresses were created on the MKR network on 18 July, a 36% growth from the 93 recorded on the previous day. However, over the next few days, this metric plunged by 22%. At press time, new addresses on the network stood at 121 addresses.\u201d Is this due to the shift in delegates ? Anyone have any thoughts ? Also, as per the article: \u201cLastly, on a social front, the token has seen a decline in its social dominance and social volume. In the last four days, its social dominance has dropped by 5%. In the same period, its social volume also declined by 87%.\u201d  How does one judge social volume? This seems very strange and I have no idea what data they are using so I hope someone here might be able to explain that to me. If not I have to chase down the author. To me this is all normal activity, this $1,000 number is arbitrary and I get the idea that the media wants to make an issue out of it because its a slow news week, but curious about the social volume aspect and why there was such a change in addresses.

To start, the definition of Social Dominance per Santiment:  \" Social Dominance for an asset compares the Social Volume of that asset to the combined social volume of the 100 largest market cap assets. Social Dominance for arbitrary search term compares the Social Volume of that search term to the total number of documents available. This essentially counts how many percent of all documents match this search term. Social Dominance of 50 for an asset means that half of all messages/posts regarding assets are discussing exactly this asset.\"   image1577\u00d7743 107 KB  With that out of the way, here\u2019s my take on it all.  May saw MKR\u2019s social dominance rise to a 2022 ATH despite falling token prices. Weighted sentiment remained overwhelming positive during this same timeframe, but has since flipped slightly negative. Social Dominance took a dip after its initial pump and has slowly risen since (feels weird to refer to Twitter volume as a pump, but\u2026)  In other words, despite falling token prices, both social dominance and weighted sentiment have trended net positive per the data supplied by Santiment; and since we can\u2019t access dominance metrics for the month, we\u2019ll pivot to social volume.  image1555\u00d7756 111 KB  Social volume (be it positive or negative), has been increasing through sideways price action. Links to the sentiment charts if you want to tinker with them, but take them with a grain of salt. Imo, social sentiment seems to be more of a surface-level vanity metric than a true indicator: MKR Social Dominance MKR Social Dom + Volume Awesome topic! Needed a solid rabbit hole to dive down!
