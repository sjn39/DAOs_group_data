Since UNI is one of the reference DAOs I think we should address the possibility of creating a collection of NFTs for the community. Remember the good reception of the first airdrop and the roadmap that was marked, in which it gave the feeling of future benefits for the community in the following years. Some members of the community continue to ask about such profit sharing, etc. For all the above and as a very important DAO, I think it is a market that we could address. a greeting ",
