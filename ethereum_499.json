                    "content": "I sort of volunteered to do a regional magicians meeting, but short of that, I had an idea. It\u2019s sort of a combination of an online and an in-person meeting. The idea is to get four ring makers to work together to coordinate introducing their ring to a larger audience. It would be video-based but in a setting in each city where small groups of real humans are physically together. The intention is introduce the rings to the humans in the room. Here\u2019s the rules of engagement:   Four ring makers come together to agree to hold a co-coordinated online video / in-person meetup event. A date and time is selected.   The ring makers seek out a volunteer from within their ring to be the ring\u2019s spokesperson. (The ring maker should not be the spokesperson if at all possible).   At the start of the \u2018meeting\u2019 (which can be scheduled to last an hour) all four spokespeople can have a short introductory discussion about the magicians in general (What are the magicians? What are the magician\u2019s not? What are rings? etc.). This first part could last for ten minutes.   For each of the next four fifteen minute periods, a spokesperson would speak exclusively to the in-person audience in each location. There could be a few minutes of question and answer. This would require the coordination of separate screen share sessions between each ring in a ring-buffer-like modulo arithmaticy kind of assignment (spokesperson 1 speaks to group 2, spokesperson 2 to group 3, 3 to group 4, 4 to group 5 % 4). During the second ten-minute section each spokesperson speaks to the next group modulo 4.   Each \u2018presentation\u2019 and \u2018question and answer\u2019 could last ten minutes and start 15 minutes apart, that would allow for switching Google screen shares and would take up about an hour (4 *15).   At the end of the hour, there could be a ten-fifteen minute \u2018wrap up\u2019 call with all four rings.   Yes \u2013 I totally understand that this may be more difficult than simply putting on a regional magician\u2019s session, but we have to learn how to dis-intermediate ourselves (thus rule 2). If anyone is interested (I need three additional rings), let me know. I host my city\u2019s Ethereum meetup, so I can be pretty flexible on timing. I\u2019d prefer an evening meetup for my group, but I can accommodate. I\u2019m the ring maker for the Data Ring, if you want to volunteer to be the spokesperson, let me know. If this does not sound like a good idea, please let me know that as well (I have a thick skin). If you\u2019d like to volunteer to do a North East of US regional event (for which I can find space in Philadelphia, PA), let me know that as well. Final note: this is a do-ocrocy. Let\u2019s do. ",
