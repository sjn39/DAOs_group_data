                    "content": "DAI holders are the main source of revenue for Maker but are their interests understood by or presented to the Maker Community? Lets focus on the holders of all DAI outstanding (Demand DAI) that isn\u2019t backed by Maker crypto loans .  How big is the Demand DAI market?  What is its revenue potential? Why do Demand DAI holders own DAI?  Can Maker better focus on both understanding and meeting the needs of this key segment of DAI holders? There are currently approximately 6.6 billion of DAI outstanding:  1.2 billion (19%) is overcollateralized by crypto asset lending (Crypto Lending) while the other 5.4 billion (81%) is mainly collateralized by other stable coins, namely USDC, (Demand DAI) in the PSM. The vast majority of Maker\u2019s revenues are currently generated via stability fees on Crypto Lending, though Maker seeks to generate significant revenues from the Demand DAI. This vision could be realized via either a profit-share agreement with the stablecoin issuers present in the PSM or via re-investment into liquid, yield-bearing instruments (cash equivalents). Maker expects Demand DAI revenue to exceed Crypto Lending revenue in the future. What is the revenue potential of Demand DAI? Over the prior five years the US Fed Funds rate averaged a 1.06% interest rate.  Assuming a 1.0% yield (normalized over a rate cycle) earned by Demand DAI assets, Maker earnings would average over 50 million DAI annually.  Thus this potential earnings stream would be significant to Maker! Why do DAI holders hold DAI:  what are the key variables that drive their decision, both Crypto Borrowers and Demand DAI holders?  Crypto Borrowers will most likely focus on key borrowing terms such as interest rate (both the rate at genesis and the likelihood that this rate changes as dictated by governance!), term and advance rates, among other items. We will, however, focus on the bigger pool of Demand DAI holders in our following discussion. Demand DAI holders most likely have different motivations for holding DAI than Crypto Borrowers.  The general view is that Demand DAI holders are using their DAI in the broader crypto ecosystem where it functions as a stable decentralized currency.  Demand DAI offers users holders three main benefits.  Usability - DAI holder has sufficient use cases for DAI, and can execute these transactions at low transaction costs. Stability - DAI holder is highly confident that DAI will maintain its value over time Censorship-Resistance - DAI, at least compared to USDC, is more difficult to trap or block  DAI Stability is clearly a key item for Demand DAI holders as they want a currency that holds its value.  What are the key risks to DAI Stability?  Credit risk:  debt assets at Maker backing DAI repay less than 100% principal, reducing the Capital Surplus Market risk:  debt assets (or other investments) at Maker backing DAI are sold at prices less than their acquisition cost, reducing the Capital Surplus.  This is typically caused by rising interest rates which reduce the price of existing fixed rate debt. Liquidity/ALM risk:  Maker\u2019s liquid assets are insufficient to cover DAI redemption requests, forcing Maker to halt DAI redemption and/or forcing Maker to sell illiquid investments at distressed prices, reducing the Capital Surplus Technology risk:  Maker\u2019s infrastructure allows assets backing DAI to be drained from the protocol or DAI itself to be misappropriated/devalued Regulatory risk:  regulators/legislators take actions that reduce the value of the assets backing DAI, reducing the Capital Surplus Maker stability risk:  the Maker protocol does not maintain a robust DAI ecosystem, impacting DAI Stability.  This is typically due to issues such as poor governance or financial distress. Capital Surplus risk:  Maker has inadequate Capital Surplus to protect Dai Stability  Most Demand DAI holders are not experts in evaluating key DAI stability risks but need, nonetheless, to determine the level of stability risk inherent to DAI.  They likely gather through both onchain and offchain information sources to form such a view.  This is a difficult task and we expect most DAI holders to form an intuitive view on DAI Stability.  If a Demand DAI holder views DAI as less than stable, they will likely exit their DAI position and find a more stable, stablecoin. Thus if Maker wants to maintain its Demand DAI holders and related revenue,  Maker needs to maintain the perception (and reality) of DAI Stability. Most Demand DAI holders can evaluate DAI Usability and determine if DAI offers them an attractive value proposition both as a stand alone product and versus potential competition. We have proposed from first principles the three dimensions that likely capture why Demand DAI holders hold DAI (or not).  Given the strategic importance and revenue potential of Demand DAI to Maker, we believe that Maker needs a focused effort that engages with Demand DAI holders, aiming both to understand their needs and also advocates their interests to the broader Maker Community.  If Maker does not offer a compelling product to Demand DAI holders, in time another protocol likely will. ",

MKR has done an amazing job with its flagship product (crypto-backed lending) but it can not only rely on revenue from a seasonal product. Organic demand DAI creates enormous reliable and stable revenue to the protocol that should allow it to experiment with other more creative/innovative projects.     Eumenes:  DAI Stability is clearly a key item for Demand DAI holders as they want a currency that holds its value   Lacking a reliable credit agency, such as the ones corporations assess before placing funds at financial institutions, inexperienced crypto users have to rely on word of mouth, education from Dex/Cex, coin charts, etc.     Eumenes:  Liquidity/ALM risk: Maker\u2019s liquid assets are insufficient to cover DAI redemption requests, forcing Maker to halt DAI redemption and/or forcing Maker to sell illiquid investments at distressed prices, reducing the Capital Surplus   I would caution though that it is yet to be proven that Demand DAI will remain strong when the bull run returns and investors appetite shifts back to risky assets. Will it be stable enough to maintain off-chain investments? We shall find out. Models for Demand DAI should incorporate a buffer for this kind of shift to avoid liquidity risk.     Eumenes:  If Maker does not offer a compelling product to Demand DAI holders, in time another protocol likely will.   There are some obvious DAI Demand use cases just by being a USD crypto stablecoin, listed below. I do agree with you that due to its revenue potential, DAI demand use cases need to expand to be able to remain competitive as other stablecoins enter the market. An opportunity I believe has huge potential is DAI gas fees, I expand on the concept in this brainstorming post. Another important aspect for creating DAI demand is generating a competitive yield, high enough to compete but not exorbitant that it attracts \u201chot\u201d money inclined to leave as soon as a better rate appears somewhere else.

For example, after Black Thursday, MKR was auctioned off to fill several million Dai gap. This incentive plus Dai being stablecoin and thus less speculative has resulted in Dai holders not being as vocal as MKR holders.
