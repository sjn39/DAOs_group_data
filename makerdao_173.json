Technical Information   Compiler versions :  Aave V2: v0.6.12+commit.27d51765 MIP50: v0.6.12+commit.27d51765    Upgradeable contract patterns :  Aave V2: Yes MIP50: No     Contract Risk Summary This is a medium risk contract. The dss-direct-deposit adapter has been built by Maker\u2019s internal team and will be undergoing an audit before raising beyond a test debt ceiling. Most of the risk comes from Aave\u2019s smart contracts. They use an upgradable pattern with Aave\u2019s governance in charge of any future upgrades. Maker opens itself up to Aave governance attack by integrating this module. In particular Aave\u2019s governance delay is 1 day vs Maker\u2019s current 2 day delay. This will prevent us from being able to react to any governance attack before it gets executed. Aave V2 has undergone 6 audits and the protocol is one of the most popular with billions locked in TVL for almost a year now. The risk of an undetected exploit being found at this stage seems small, but should not be completely discounted due to the complexity. ",
