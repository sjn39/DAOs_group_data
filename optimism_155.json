Summary Noting the number of proposals and consultations made by the delegates to the proponents. We request, along with other delegates and government members, this modification to the application template. So that projects/protocols/proponents can more robustly and strongly articulate the actions they will take with the amount of tokens requested. Also so that the delegate has more information when making a decision. Important: If you think any item is missing or you think we should add another question, leave your proposal in this thread and we will add the changes. Objectives: This proposal is ONLY to modify the postulation template to improve communication between delegates and postulants. 1- Name of the project: 2- Type of project (Dex, loan, bridge, etc). 3-Explain in a short text what your project is about, keep it short (220 words): 4- Project links (include all possible):  Web Twitter Discord Telegram GitHub Youtube Instagram Facebook Others  5- Name of the author of the proposal: 6- Social networks:  Twitter Discord Telegram  7-Team members (optional):  Name Twitter Discord Telegram  8- Number of OP tokens requested: 9- Your project is currently deployed/implemented in Optimism YES/NO: 10- Date of deploy of operations in Optimism: 11- L2 Recipient Address: 12- Address assigned to receive funds if is a multisig/treasure DAO (provide signatory addresses): 13- Relevant on-chain usage metrics (Optimism metrics only):  TVL Transactions Volume Unique addresses  14- Metric Links:  DefiLLama DuneAnalycs Others  15- Optimism alignment (up to 150 word explanation): 16- Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed?

My reasoning:- on project details:   during last few week I have seen all the proposals and few of them miss to include important details like project metric, I had to check on defilama for that, its project responsibility to provide us the details not other way around.   Few proposals has missing website link to their project, again, they should include this in their proposal. Twitter, git and other social media presence will help us both.   This    9- Your project is currently deployed/implemented in Optimism YES/NO:  is important and missing in 30-40% of proposals, if your project is not live on OP chain, give us a rough estimate date.  (on point 16) Phase 0 was an inauguration phase, Phase 1; cycle 1 and 2 was mostly focused on liquidity and few of us give them benefit of doubt when supporting the proposal, including myself. Going forward, I would like to see more details on their token distribution, KPI based is even better.  I know once these changes are included, proposal will be little big compared to current one but it will also contain all the necessary information to make a judgement call on first glance. Also, dont forget to use the discord temp-check channel. Happy to hear your input. ",
