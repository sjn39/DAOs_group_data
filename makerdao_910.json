Now separate from the Weekly Relay with the objective to scale and improve all the information you need for your Dai escapades!  The public PDF version is available here.   Peg870\u00d7623 107 KB   Slight peg variance in the past 24 hours. So we can dive into that arb, for once.   1192\u00d7424 78.9 KB   On-chain slippage above peg hit $1.14 with a 2.94 million DAI trade on Sushiswap.   1257\u00d7482 102 KB   Sushi monster trade hit 7 hours ago; follow along with the MEV bot to see their execution in realtime.   Below peg1134\u00d7436 69 KB   And the corresponding trade volume below peg at Uniswap v2 pools.    A nice healthy arb for a 287 ETH profit. Someone has been reading state of DAI      All that detective work explains our lovely peg stats for the week\u2014free markets for the win.   DAI Supply1364\u00d7745 80.9 KB   A slight reduction in Dai supply, including USDC down to 53% of generation.   Vault changes1210\u00d7868 144 KB   Reduction in # of ETH-A vaults and 52 million outflows from WBTC-A, but additions in ETH-C and staked ETH-A.    Staked ETH carved out a sliver of the debt share.   Hit the DC1089\u00d7497 31.3 KB   Debt ceiling is maxed, but there are threads about accelerating access to this ilk.   Borrow/repay754\u00d7604 48.6 KB   Net negative (burns) of 116 million this last week.  Visit Makerburn for an up-to-the-minute breakdown.   Risky debt is mostly on the medium bucket.   Liquidation breakdown per drop789\u00d7445 51.6 KB   Slight adjustment to the liquidation hill, a hypothetical drop of 27% instead of 29% hits 26 million in Debt.    By protection bucket and drop, collateralization is keeping capital at-risk low. It has to go beyond 30% to start hurting, at which point we would have larger problems.  daistats.com | makerburn.com | maker.blockanalitica.com   Have Feedback? We value your input!
