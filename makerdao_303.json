After mining for some years \u2014 or at most decades \u2014 no company would want to take on the responsibility of decommissioning a nuclear reactor and managing high-level nuclear waste for millennia.

Perhaps the MCA \u2013 which infamously provided the lump of coal for Scott Morrison to wave around in parliament \u2013 thinks that promoting nuclear power will slow the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and believes that it is in the interests of some of its member companies to slow the transition.
