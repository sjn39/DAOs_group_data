Paragraph Summary MIP39c2-SP28 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent. Through the establishment of the Maker Talent Core Unit as a center of expertise, MakerDAO will get a competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining crypto talent, given the outstanding hiring/work experience they will be able to provide to their core contributors. At the same time, the Maker Talent CU will be able to make assessments and audit reports about the Core Units\u2019 best practices in the area of people management.  Specification  Motivation  The Problem In a decentralized and open-source environment, the main source of competitive advantage \u2014in addition to mission and culture\u2014 is the ability to provide an outstanding contributor experience from the moment they enter the DAO until they exit. The better the experience of the contributors with your people practices, the more eager they are willing to join and stay for the long term. Keeping the above in mind and in order to be able to fully support the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) with their overall growth plans centred around scalability and measuring performance, we need to think more strategically about people practices without limiting the ability of each Core Unit to run autonomously.  Core Unit Name  Name: Maker Talent   Core Unit ID  ID: MT-001   Core Unit Facilitators  Discord: manomad#0321 Forum: @manomad    Core Unit Mandate  Vision To give MakerDAO a competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining the best crypto talent by building the most outstanding hiring/contributing experience in the industry.  Mission In order to build the best hiring/contributing experience, we will establish a Talent Core Unit that will act as a center of expertise, researching, designing, and deploying the best people practices for a DAO ecosystem so that CUs are empowered to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner.  Strategy Given the agile and decentralized nature of MakerDAO, we will be leveraging the contributor experience a core contributor has, with the different touchpoints (hiring, onboarding, goal setting, performance, compensation, learning, internal mobility, exiting) along their journey in the DAO as the central driver for defining challenges, needs and priorities. This \u201cactively listening in\u201d to our contributor community will be facilitated by the deployment of a contributor experience management platform.   Goals While we will be building the whole set of experiences a contributor has with the DAO from entry to exit, we have selected the following priorities for 2022 based on stakeholder input, \u201cdependables\u201d, expected ROI and expected bandwidth:  Build the talent acquisition infrastructure based on the different parts of the mapped out candidate journey:   1600\u00d7866 157 KB   Design and deploy other touchpoints of the contributor experience that are needed to build a properly functioning talent acquisition infrastructure:  Improve our workforce planning to more proactively forecast the demand for contributors and resources needed. Get a proper job evaluation system in place that can determine the impact and complexity of each role relative to one another. This is a very technical process that requires analyzing each role in depth and breadth, within the same Core Unit and across others. All this must be linked to a fair and equitable compensation system that can be used across CUs (similar to the MKR retention bonus plan). Automate the admin onboarding for core contributors, which is all about the practical onboarding of core contributors to the DAO rather than the onboarding of people into the MakerDAO ecosystem.   Underpin all touchpoints of the contributor experience with an Experience Management Platform (integration layer) which enables ongoing contributor listening in so we can continuously measure and further optimize the different experiences.  Given that the contributor experience will be the measurement for the success of Maker Talent and central to defining challenges and priorities, we need to underpin all touchpoints of the contributor experience with an experience management platform that pulls data indicating how good or how bad their experience is with a particular people practice. This is a very innovative way of being able to listen in to the contributors on an ongoing basis that will enable us to take swift action and apply fixes wherever needed.

We are planning a minimum of 3 big events a 3 small events per year. Believe me, there are huge hiring opportunities in going to events! By dedicating 5 minutes per candidate to do flash interviews you can get loads of leads, light up their interest in Maker projects and offer some insights on how life in a DAO really is. ",

Other than dev skills, team-work and individual productivity factors are what make people deliver value in the end while guaranteeing retention of a new hire. Many filters tthat put these skills to test should be applied before an individual is finally onboarded with the team.

No, we don\u2019t want to do event activation, we are not marketing. We do recruitment, and the main reason why we go to events is to seek for talent. Promoting MakerDAO as a good place to work, educate people on what a DAO is, and let people know about the projects we are working on is an indirect benefit that, again, has an impact on recruitment, as it will bring more people to the ecosystem\u2026 people that, in a few years, can be Maker contributors. For a recruiter, going to an event searching for talent means doing 5 minutes flash interviews one after another, from 8 am to 6 pm non stop. How can you measure the ROI of 50 useful out of 400 not useful conversations that you went through during an event? How can you measure the ROI of having saved your time from doing 100 useless interviews on Skype? Because that can be subjective, the KPIs that have proven success in recruitment are: 1. Time to hire, 2. number of successful placements vs. offers posted, 3. candidate/hiring manager satisfaction, and (optional) 4. Turnover. The vision is not centralised. The vision is what you dream to be. In our case, we are an internal service Core Unit, which means we are providing services to other Core Units. Governance is not decentralised, Data Insights is not decentralised. In an ideal world we would create a MIP for every single candidate that is about to become a contributor, but that will take ages and we\u2019d be loosing candidates along the funnel. On the other hand, not centralising our candidates database will mean a big GDPR problem and so far we don\u2019t have, as a DAO, the legal basis to cover this issue. The good part of this is that when it comes to Talent and DAOs, everything is yet to be invented, and we can be the ones creating a way of decentralising candidate\u2019s management or even tokenising our talent community. All these are projects, but what MakerDAO needs now is HELP FINDING TALENT. Utilising social media to connect with talent. The way we use social media is to open conversations with candidates, explain the problems we are trying to solve, and make them feel interested in having an interview with us. The only one thing you can quantify is SPAM and/or number of interviews\u2026 or maybe paid job ads. But let me tell you, the world of recruitment is tricky, sometimes you can post an ad, spend 200 euro in cryptojobs.com and find the right person in one week, or you can search for six months and the right candidate never pops up. I can\u2019t apply the same strategy for finding a Lead Smart Contract Engineer to the one I use to find a Marketing role, they are in different places and at a different recruitment cost. So my best answer is, indeed, having a strategy for each position, hence \u201cI partner with Hiring Managers with the best map possible on where I can find specific talent.\u201d Reduce your budget and overdeliver. Before submitting this MIP, I had an interview with every single facilitator in Maker to help them forecasting their staff needs for next year. Most of them couldn\u2019t predict how many people will leave, and the ones that needed more contributors, couldn\u2019t determine when to start recruiting. One of the reasons of this is that the MIP and budgeting process is still slow, and it impacts on the ability of a Core Unit to respond quickly to an unexpected pick on the demand. The best way of navigating through this is shaping a 100% flexible Core Unit that, based on demand, can grow according to Maker needs. This is what we are trying to achieve in Maker Talent and so far, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the results.    ",

It\u2019s on the managers and the team in the traditional top-down management paradigm. In the flat structured DAO, the contributor themself (most important!), the facilitator or/and leader and the entire team is responsible for growth of its members. Traditional HR departments almost always fail to identify individual team members\u2019 growth needs. You need to work alongside someone to know what would foster their development path. You need to develop trust as well. So I would still leave the \u201cgrowth\u201d part to the Core Units. \u201cOffboarding\u201d however could be addressed in a minimal model as an \u201cexit interview\u201d whereby the answers are categorized and collected for statistical study.

Badly handled off-boarding is likely to negatively effect Maker\u2019s reputation and to make the job of attracting talent harder.   Hello @JustinCase - I couldn\u2019t agree more. This is a very sensitive subject and It affects not only Maker\u2019s reputation, but it also impacts on the possibility of the contributor of finding a new opportunity in the future. We are a small niche. At this moment we will only focus on recruitment, but for sure retention and offboarding are part of the projects in the pipeline. Obviously we will need the community to approve first that this are things we could try to review and improve. IMO we need to:  Review the different scenarios in which we can off-board a contributor and create standard procedures that are easy to follow. Always, by policy, give the possibility (and a deadline) for the contributor to leave the CU by himself/herself. In some cases the contributor can be assigned to a different project or CU if there\u2019s a match between needs and skills. MakerTalent can help with that. Collect data from exit interviews so we can avoid mistakes from the past. And, of course, share the feedback with the community.  If everything goes as expected I will be able to make proposals on the offboarding process by the end of Q1. ",

Also, it would be great to break down recruitment strategies/best practices in terms of the different types of talent sourcing used in the DAO: employees, independent contractors, grantees, interns etc.   The 360 of an entire Talent Management strategy involves definitely all the areas you mentioned and many more. In an ideal world we should be able to cover the entire life of the contributor at MakerDAO from hiring to the offboarding\u2026 but this time we are only focused on recruitment. Coaching, Training, Performance, Perks and Benefits, etc. are not part of this MIP and they all require a specific strategy and roadmap per role, location and Core Unit. We decided to start proving efficiency in one area, and then expand to others. ",

It\u2019s on the managers and the team in the traditional top-down management paradigm. In the flat structured DAO, the contributor themself (most important!), the facilitator or/and leader and the entire team is responsible for growth of its members. Traditional HR departments almost always fail to identify individual team members\u2019 growth needs. You need to work alongside someone to know what would foster their development path. You need to develop trust as well. So I would still leave the \u201cgrowth\u201d part to the Core Units. \u201cOffboarding\u201d however could be addressed in a minimal model as an \u201cexit interview\u201d whereby the answers are categorized and collected for statistical study. This is what we do at @SES-Core-Unit, but definitely could be externalized onto Maker Talent.   @synesthesia I believe that the single contributor (specially working remotely) is not always capable of self-managing his/her own professional growth and seeing the big picture on his career path. As you know, many times managers end up being managers because of their technical knowledge and not because of their people skills. I believe that we should be able to provide tools to other CUs for personal growth, but in the future. Tools can come in different formats like tests, software to measure performance, personal coaching, team activities, among others. Execution is everything. A good attitude, customised tools and consistency are part of the secret sauce.  ",

In a Recruitment MIP what you offer is a generic view of the strategy you will use to find profiles you previously forecasted and that are key for Maker\u2019s growth. Obviously this strategy changes 100% from one profile to another. What it actually makes sense is:  List, know and analyse the map of \u201cwhere to find\u201d the talent that Maker needs based on current roles and the projects that Maker has in the pipeline (probably too long to be detailed on a MIP). Partner with facilitators so you can understand CUs real problems and give them advice on what the employment market can offer to solve them. Save them time by doing first interviews and help them during the entire process so they can focus on their job. Expand our database so next time we need someone we can respond faster.  We went through all the stages of the SES Incubation program and passed them successfully. We took every step with responsibility and commitment. That\u2019s why we are here  ",

ATM, Facilitators are expected to be not only an expert in their field but also a master of everything else relating to running a business. This isn\u2019t scalable. A DAO is still an organization. Organizations have needs and people are the top priority IMO. Having a core unit(s) to consolidate and distribute HR functions (starting with hiring) makes perfect sense. I\u2019ve worked with organizations where I\u2019ve had a competent recruiting team vs the other end of the spectrum using a DIY process. DIY was painful. I spent a huge chunk of my time managing the process, recruiters (and finding them), internal interviewers, offers, counters, and on and on. The DIY model is a disservice to the Facilitator since it doesn\u2019t allow them to do their job. I was one of the core units to pilot with the Maker Talent Core Unit. Of a team of seven, four were hired with the assistance of this core unit: three engineers and one technical product manager. While it was a beta program and room for improvement, it was a huge assistance for me as I was setting up the operations for my core unit\u2026which is no easy task and again, full of duplicative efforts. And, it was VERY cost effective\u2026we saved the DAO a lot in finder\u2019s fees. Basically, working with the Maker Talent CU allowed me to do my job as a Facilitator and Team Lead which accelerated the time it took to get my CU up and running\u2026 Would I \u201chire\u201d them again to help me? You bet! Everything we\u2019re doing here at MakerDAO is an experiment. I see this as a first iteration of something the protocol and DAO needs to be successful. I am unable to tell you the proper budget or strategy and I would encourage people to ask the questions. What I am looking for is to work with a professional such as @manomad and allow him to do his job for the DAO, evaluate his progress against evolving strategy/goals that is the norm in our industry, and have the community decide if it\u2019s working for us. We\u2019re all just one vote away\u2026  I see a lot of questions/comments on this post. I would ask that if you\u2019ve been a serial hiring manager, please share as much of your direct, actual experiences as possible when responding since it helps all of us learn. ",

I also understand the cost/overhead of spinning up a CU and want to be attentive to those concerns as it relates to offboarding a CU. MIP39 is one of three MIPs being proposed for this core unit. MIP39 quite ambiguous and I think it leads to all sorts of comments/questions/ideas about what actually should be in a MIP39. Maybe some of this should be directed at the MIP itself. As a DAO, if we don\u2019t have a smooth offboarding process, that\u2019s on us. If we have concerns that the necessary information isn\u2019t present in the onboarding MIP set, we need to figure that out. If we need better definitions on experimentation, let\u2019s put that together and publish those as guidelines. My goal would be to have the DAO rapidly onboard, experiment, and offboard core units as needed. I really like the community asking tough questions and offering real, actionable, collaborative ideas on how to modify a proposed MIP. What I don\u2019t see is a collective agreement on what constitutes the acceptable level of information in the MIP to \u201ccheck the box\u201d so that we can have a conversation on whether the core unit is the best use of our limited resources. SES has done the most work to prepare core units for launching. If we feel additional information would help us make a decision, let\u2019s start there to enhance  and iterate on the current process.

SES covered compensation and the recruitee starter plan (plus g-suite and some other basic things). Phase 2, explained in the MIP and here, has a much broader scope. We will have a proper team, use new software for referrals, contributor experience and new sourcing tools. All this will be activated upon uproval of the Core Unit. We now have 14 openings (makerdao.recruitee.com) and we are expecting 2-3 more before the end of the month. This is very good news for us as Maker Talent is helping many CUs and becoming more and more relevant for the DAO. In March we will start phase 2 and continue doing placements. Have a nice weekend, Mano ",
