As a community we seem to have decided that other stablecoins such as USDC, TUSD and PAX are preferable to USDT from a risk perspective. With the current SF and CR on USDT there has been virtually no uptake on this Vault type. At 10 Million the current DC is much smaller than for the other stablecoins, however, in the case of a USDT price collapse a 10M loss is not entirely insignificant. I realize that MakerDAO and the crypto markets in general would probably have much larger issues if USDT were to fail but I don\u2019t really see any benefit to keeping a 10M ceiling for USDT in any case. Are there any compelling reasons not to lower to debt ceiling significantly, say to 1M or 2M? Cheers, OneBite ",

It is the leading centralized stablecoin, far outstripping all others, but there have been multiple warnings made about the collateral backing Tether. The company is not making it easier on itself by having the worst collateral reporting of any stablecoin, I think the last was some lawyer firm statement in 2018 unless I am wrong. That being said - Tether has survived since 2015, braving all booms and busts the market has delivered. I thought the crash of 2018 would finish it off, but no. So Tether is difficult to match with Maker, resulting in a small debt ceiling and a very high stability fee. There are not many takers but this is often the case with relatively new collateral. Give it to the end of the year at the minimum, after that a discussion about removing/reducing it becomes more relevant. ",

Reality is that stablecoin with a higher LR than others unfortunately won\u2019t be utilized unless DC for other stablecoins are fully utilized. Even if LR is set to 130% LR with lower DC, it won\u2019t be utilized. So the only reason for having it might be only to protect against DAI liquidity crunch during intense liquidations when DCs on other stablecoins potentially get maxed out, so have similar effect USDC-B was meant to have. LR is actually set to 150% and not 175% as mentioned in this thread. So there is protection against 33% drop / partially unbacked scenario, which was an issue with USDT in the past. It is really up to community if they want to lower exposure by simply decreasing DC. Making calculated risk bets on USDT is hard. We have seen how even when Tether admitted in the past that they have backing issues price didn\u2019t really collapse as much as it should. As if tether economy became so big and fundamental that market participants simply ignored backing issues. On the other hand we have also seen how situation with Bitmex evolved overnight. So yeah, in current situation where other stablecoins have LR of 101%, I don\u2019t see a reason for USDT to really exist, risk reward ratio might not justify it. ",
