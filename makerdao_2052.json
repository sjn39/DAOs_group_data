                    "content": "Are you interested in a proposal to get more adoption? We offer to integrate MakerDAO with \u201cThe Graph\u201d infrastructure to allow querying the blockchain with an EVM standard Tech Stack. Protofire is one of the oldest and biggest indexers on The Graph Network. Protofire has developed this proposal. The Graph hosted service will provide the following services:  **Integration feasibility **The Graph Cluster Implementation - Maintenance & Support **Subgraph Indexing as a Service  These services offer seamless integration into reliable infrastructure that will increase performance, security, and scalability. From a Business perspective, this kind of infrastructure will embrace decentralization and simultaneously have a premium service that allows for a better analytic user experience and more adoption. In the case of EVM-compatible Networks with more throughput, relying on a premium infrastructure is even more critical to generating adoption. This kind of service will make it easier for developers and allow dApps to offer a better experience to its users. I\u2019ve been studying the web3 ecosystem for a while and found that much traction is lost on the UX side. To become mainstream, it requires a world-class user experience. That finding is a no-brainer. The user experience typically focuses on the end user, but I\u2019m referring to something else. The UX problem I\u2019m talking about is from the developer\u2019s perspective. To get adoption, networks must provide certain features to be eligible by developers. Especially, when they partner with well-known protocols that require infrastructure services like indexing on-chain data, oracles, and multi-sig. Building these infrastructure services can be complex, expensive, and time-consuming. Usually, the lack of internal human resources or bandwidth delays these developments and implementations even more. Not to mention keeping up with upgrades and compatibility issues or providing support to the dev community. Protofire is in the business of improving protocol adoption and ecosystem growth acceleration by providing analytics capabilities to Web3 players. Protofire delivers an end-to-end service from infrastructure as a service, subgraph development, and community engagement. If you are interested in improving your network or protocol adoption, do not hesitate to contact us. ",
