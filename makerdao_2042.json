                    "content": "Is there any estimate on when there\u2019ll be a DAI smart contract available that has a limited permit function? Ideally it would be nice to also have a transferWithAuthorisation function like USDC has. For payments integrators like Trelis the lack of a limited permit makes DAI pretty unusable if we\u2019re offering gasless payments. At least with a permit, we could offer gasless payments with a deployed smart contract. With transferWithAuthorisation we\u2019d be able to offer gasless DAI payments just as we do for USDC. Any indications on timeline or roadmap are much appreciated. I\u2019m guessing it would have to wait until some major protocol update\u2026which probably isn\u2019t soon. ",

                    "content": "Yeah the permit function is there, but it is unlimited. This means that anyone signing a permit is giving unlimited spend approval. Some protocols have devised different work arounds, but it\u2019s clunky and results in users often unknowingly signing unlimited approvals for DAI to be spent from their wallet. In a network where txes are largely irreversible, this is quite a drawback. I\u2019m trying to make payment UX better with Trelis and this means getting rid of the need to have Eth for gas. With USDC I can nicely use limited permits or their transferWithAuthorisation function. It might seem like a small thing, but this UX friction is a significant adoption barrier imo. I thought that since Aave moved to v2, and since Maker might move to a floating peg some day, maybe there is some future opportunity to have a better smart contract. ",
