Seeing all of the positive feedback from the community gets me excited to push this forward. The mission of this workstream is to decentralize Gitcoin and empower the community that it serves. The first step toward accomplishing our mission is to increase transparency and open the lines of communication with the community. I will start by providing regular updates on our progress beginning today! Community Status & Updates - Published Workstream Suggestion post - Published Steward post Decentralization Architecture Proposal Creation Status - Aiming to propose multiple solutions for each area which requires decentralization recommending one with background on why - Goal is to focus on solutions that provide same or better UX/Performance - Proposal focus is currently overall but will move to prioritizing decentralized storage/retrieval initially Research - Researched Gnosis SafeSnap - Digging into MACI - Better understand types of attacks on Gitcoin grants to date - Will dig into The Graph and Indexers (initial high level research done, will test implementation) - Got caught up on background of Hackathons and details (with Connor) - Meeting with Aditya to understand current codebase / GitHub Next Steps - Will post a bounty to have API documentation built in Swagger ",

Looking forward to the traction this gets.     phutchins:  Will post a bounty to have API documentation built in Swagger   Has that bounty been posted yet?  Would love to help where I can. If you find a good resource on some of the attacks on Gitcoin grants I would love to dive-in and do some research.  Finding where the community has been exploited in the past is a great place to start, and I\u2019d love to read about it or get in touch with people who can explain a bit of it. I know it\u2019s a fresh workstream, but is there anything specific you would like help with, either from the community or an individual? Thanks for the great work!  So excited to see the community in action. ",

Regarding attacks on Gitcoin grants, this article is a great place to start. Also check out the Grants round 9 governance brief. We are almost to the point in the timeline where we could begin accepting help as I\u2019d like for us to take an organized approach which will be possible once we have a better idea of where we are headed and all of the moving pieces involved. In the mean time, it would be great to hear ideas around how we can get the community more involved while keeping the progress moving quickly. ",

Over the last week we\u2019ve made some great progress on the Architecture Proposal and are nearing completion of the initial draft. Most of the big pieces are getting clearer and are falling into place. We realize that we have a huge resource here in our community and we are working hard to get to a place where we can accept all of the generous offers for help and contribution. Once we have a clear draft of the Architecture Proposal that is laid out in conceptual pieces, or building blocks if you will, we will be much better positioned to start more specific conversations around each of those areas and begin to give clear direction for those that would like to contribute their time, brain power, and experience. Gitcoin Community, we appreciate you! Community Status & Updates - We have created a channel on discord (#decentralize-gitcoin) specifically for discussion around decentralizing Gitcoin - Created a grant for funding the Decentralize Gitcoin Grants project (repo is currently empty awaiting the initial draft of the Architecture Proposal) Decentralization Architecture Proposal Creation Status - Initial draft of Architecture proposal is nearly complete Research - We are currently focused on areas like curation, and payout and matching calculation which are more difficult to decentralize and keep costs down Proof of Concept - I have begun building a Grant Registry and Grant Rounds contract which will be open sourced in the coming weeks - Next will be building a very simple UI (Dapp), Integrating Metadata, and implementing Graph Protocol Next Steps - Preparing to schedule initial community update call - Progress on API documentation has been halted as we have discovered a parallel initiative that is moving forward with something similar to this - Wrap up Architecture Proposal draft and post to the DGrants Github for feedback - Continue work on POC and move to DGrants Github P.S. I\u2019d love to here thoughts around how I post these updates moving forward\u2026     Future updates should be posted in this thread. Future updates should be posted in a new thread each time.     0 voters     ",
