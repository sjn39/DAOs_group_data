                    "content": "Novel Situation #1 - (A situation that suggests Gitcoin Policy needs updating\u2026) \u201cGrant Applicants should not have a token\u201d TL:DR  This criteria is outdated since a large number of projects now use token based governance systems.  We can revise this to read \u201cGrant applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens\u201d to remain true to Gitcoin principals.  We need to update it because we are denying quality deserving projects that should be eligible imo. One of Gitcoin\u2019s legacy eligibility criteria reads \u201cthe project should not have its own token or have raised VC funding\u2026\u201d  This comes from the earlier grant round criteria and is a carry over from a time when the general crypto space was less mature.  Daos were not yet popular and had not determined that token-based voting was the preferred decentralized decision making method. It is important to notice that the language in this guidance is suggestive (\u2018should\u2019) and not mandatory (unlike with quid pro quo or hate speech criteria where the wording is \u2018must\u2019 and/or \u2018shall\u2019).  This criteria is suggestive in nature not a mandate. The development of the dao, with token voting, marked a key shift in the general decentralization movement.  Now, for maybe the first time, groups of individuals could use legacy web2 tools combined with blockchain technology to rapidly coordinate around goals or themes. Uniswap and Bankless might have been some of the earlier groups to become a dao and rapidly coordinate using governance tokens.  Both are long term recipients of Gitcoin grant donations.  The technique of creating and distributing governance tokens to a community which then forms (or already has formed) a Dao is commonplace.  Token based voting is the number one method by which daos govern imo.  Left alone, this system might be fine.  Unfortunately it exists within the framework of the free market. A market made even more free by the proliferation of pseudonymous and privacy enhancing tools and techniques associated with cryptocurrency and blockchains.  And this free market is very observant.  And created tokens become publicly accessible.  When some project shows success potential the market wants to invest in and have some control over said project.  The easiest way to do this is to accumulate governance tokens.  Many governance tokens end up with some ascribed value and are traded on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.  Even if this goes against the wishes/values of the founding team. This creates the issue.  At one time Gitcoin banned projects with (monetary) tokens.  This was before tokens became the primary decentralized governance technique of daos.  Now we have projects that meet all the eligibility criteria except for the \u2018\u2026should not have its own token\u2026\u2019 item.  At this state in dao governance it seems inappropriate to deny funding to projects based on the existence of its own token.  More critical, is how the token is used. Greater investigation and analysis is called for.  Questions I might consider include: Examine the initial token distribution- how decentralized vs just the founding team? Examine the  general project tokenomics- how decentralized vs just the founding team? Is the token actively used in governance? How long was the token used in governance before it became traded on any exchange? Is the token generating revenue and what happens to that revenue? How much has the token increased in value since inception? How much are the general operating expenses of the project? Using general operating expenses and token value change since inception, can it be determined if a project is earning or losing revenue?  Again what happens to that revenue? What are the metrics around trading the token?  What is the total daily volume traded? Is token deflationary or inflationary? It is difficult to determine the true nature of a token without detailed financial auditing which goes beyond the expectations of an average grant reviewer. In conclusion, I find it really is the reason for the existence of a given token that determines its effect on gitcoin eligibility.  Did the token get created to facilitate governance or to generate centralized profits.  If there is any evidence that the token got created for governance, I recommend the project be deemed eligible.  Even if the free market used the created token for speculation.  Unfortunately this opens the door to projects categorizing any and all tokens as gov tokens.  To mitigate this we may need to consider the greater reputation of a project in the space. Lastly, I would change the official wording on that criteria to: \u201cGrant Applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens.\u201d Would love to hear other opinions on this matter.  Do you think a project should be denied Gitcoin funding because it has a token used for governance?  Why or why not? Here is what Bright ID stated to the fdd: Hi, Grants Appeals team, I\u2019d like to outline the case for our appeal of matching funds eligibility dispute. The matching eligibility was disputed on the basis of the recent launch of the $Bright token. $Bright is a community token for the community surrounding BrightID to decide on its usage. I understand and in general agree that projects that raise funds through a token sale should remove themselves from matching fund eligibility. $Bright was not sold, however; it was given away to BrightID verified individuals, through a process we called the \u201cfairdrop\u201d (\u201cfair\u201d being used to signify that tokens were primarily distributed to unique humans, not wallets). Bright DAO is a 1Hive Gardens DAO that only deals in its own token, $Bright. It is also not the entity that manages the BrightID Gitcoin grant. The entity that manages the Gitcoin grant is a Delaware non-profit Legal DAO called BrightID Main LLC, receiving its non-profit sponsorship under the Grantcoin Foundation (DBA Hedge for Humanity). Philip Silva is the member that has submitted KYC on behalf of the Delaware non-profit to be able to receive donations through Gitcoin. I have CC\u2019ed him in this email. Though I don\u2019t think any quid-pro-quo accusations were raised, I\u2019ll mention just in case that we were careful to avoid communication about the upcoming fairdrop in our grant description and tokens were fairdropped to Gitcoin contributors and projects based on their trust bonus usage, but not based on donating to BrightID. More information about the $Bright fairdrop and token in general are found in the BrightID Gitbook. It\u2019s my feeling that if $Bright receives enough price support that Bright DAO alone can fund the non-profit initiatives of BrightID, we should stop asking for donations from Gitcoin users, CLR.Fund users, Giveth users, and the Ethereum foundation. I hope we can reach that day soon. Let us know if Philip or I can help clarify anything. Feel free to make this appeal public. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve said anything that shouldn\u2019t be public knowledge. \u2013Adam Stallard, Founder, BrightID ",

It would make sense to me to exclude Giveth, because their token became pretty successful on the open market, so they should be able to support themselves as of now. If BrightID is not able to (their tokenomics model with the fairdrop was/is very different) and they are threatened in their existence by this, this is quite dramatic, as they are doing crucial work in the identity space. Would be curious to also hear @annika\u2019s thoughts on this or other people from the grants team.

                    "content": "Thank you for the detailed write up @David_Dyor Great work here! THE INTENTION OF THE POLICY The policy exists to make the subjective more objective and to eliminate favoritism & bias as we select which grants are allowed to benefit from the matching pools during Grants rounds. The policy around having a token or over $500k in vc funding was intended to draw a line between projects that have adequate funding without needing Gitcoin Grants (and sometimes end up being for profit rather than public goods.) BrightID is creating a public digital infrastructure that we all use and benefit from. The scale of what they are trying to accomplish is enormous. imho FUNDING PROJECTS LIKE BRIGHT ID IS WHAT GITCOIN EXISTS TO DO Did BrightID launch a token. YES. Does that token provide them funding to complete the building of their system. NO. The purpose of an appeals system is to allow for novel or gray area circumstances to be heard. It also serves to update precedent. Because this is the first real end to end appeal which would change the current policy, we can\u2019t play this as though we have hundreds of years of an English common law system to rely upon. Instead, we must not punish the projects who are clearly in this gray area while we as a community find the proper tools to express community consent of these decisions. I\u2019d say that leaving BrightID out creates undue hardship which is worse than the slight hit to our legitimacy. THE UNSTABLE GROUND FOR FOLLOWING A LETTER OF LAW APPROACH Everytime I think about this situation, I envision my grandfather slapping me over the head with a newspaper saying \u201cyou know what you\u2019re supposed to do!\u201d The appeal process within FDD should be able to accommodate this situation, but please be aware that this is the first end to end appeal we have adjudicated. In the last year we have gone from:  Kevin or Joe make the decision and tweet about it A group of reviewers make the decision A uniform set of standards is used by the group to make the decision A process for flagging and disputing is adjudicated by a community review panel This first case that didn\u2019t get a legitimate decision in the mechanisms above and we have the resources to implement the appeals process.  The current appeal process was written by me when we were in stage 1 above! I had no clue how cumbersome the idea of having stewards vote on every appeal could be, or the damage it could do to a grant by making it ineligible while we formed our processes to execute said vote. We have even written updates to the (so far unused) appeals policy, but haven\u2019t moved them to the source of truth Gitcoin uses because that source of truth has been changing and we didn\u2019t want to double the work. (See new knowledge base to replace support.gitcoin.co) Working on the frontier of web 3 is exciting, but sometimes it means we are making this up as we go. Our legitimacy at this point isn\u2019t from following the letter of the law, but from having a clear purpose, communicating our decisions in the post round governance briefs, and getting better round over round. I see no reason why a rule that I wrote about a year ago which has seen  uses thus far can\u2019t be mended to provide the proper intention of our policy. As we have matured, we have realized the need for a system based in English common law which can remove bias and provides a pathway for updating our precedent. Once this system is fully in place, then we can be 100% letter of the law, but we are still building that system now. This community (ethereum/gitcoin) went through the DAO hard fork and realized that code isn\u2019t law. In this case, the law isn\u2019t law yet because it isn\u2019t built on a solid substrate that is resilient to outside pressures. WHAT WE WILL DO FOR THIS ROUND For this case, we will open up the bright ID grant for participation as to not cause them undo hardship. (They already lost GR12 funding.) We will then run the updated appeals process end to end during the round and be willing to turn off their eligibility if it is found that the community does not agree. I believe the community is mature enough for this approach which is fundamentally allowing FDD to make a judgement call on whether they should be considered innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven innocent. In light of the massive evidence to suggest this is indeed a novel situation in which the letter of the law goes against the intended desires of the community, we feel safe to move forward in this way for this time critical situation. We will continue the conversation here as well. The decision to include isn\u2019t final until the round is over, however, the decision to exclude would do irreparable harm. ",

I hope we can reach that day soon.   When might this be? What threshold feels appropriate?   We have a had a hiring freeze on our core team since the launch of Bright DAO.  We\u2019re slowly reducing our team and trying to transition them to be contributors to Bright DAO instead and reducing core team to a minimum support staff to manage the \u201ccentralized\u201d pieces of BrightID.  (App store listings, website, other web accounts, test hardware, etc.) Once this transition is done, the financial needs of BrightID core should probably go down from $30,000 / month to $10,000 / month, and BrightID Main DAO will need less grant money.

We did not anticipate that the appeal would take this long. I think there was miscommunication in FDD in terms of ownership of executing the appeal which may have been outside of @David_Dyor  scope as he owned the outcome of building out the appeals system. I believe we focused on building the system rather than executing on getting BrightID through it properly and in a timely way. For this round The BrightID grant #191 is currently set as active and eligible for matching. We will execute on the appeal process during the next week. This could be compared to letting the defendant be free while awaiting trial vs being jailed while waiting trial. Potential Outcome #1 - Appeal is successful / Ruling Overturned In the case the community wishes to revise the policy (maybe how David suggests above), then their grant will remain active AND eligible for GR13 matching. In addition, we would follow up with a governance request to make a payment to BrightID equivalent to their matching lost in GR12. Because this is a first, we don\u2019t know if the community would prefer us to spend more from the matching pool to resolve this or if they feel that it is fair for the project to have lost these funds (or don\u2019t receive them as a right, but more as a privilege). The snopshot vote would answer this question and set precedent for the future. Potential Outcome #2 - Appeal is not successfull - Ruling is not Overturned In this situation, BrightID\u2019s grant #191 will be made ineligible for matching funds on the Gitcoin backend prior to the final calculations for GR13.

I now believe it is the best way forward for the dao, though cumbersome (temporarily).   It would be difficult to evaluate fringe cases as just one of many dao-workstreams when the precedent set could have major future ripples.  I agree with Joe that a full Steward Vote is suitable.

Our \u201cshould not have a token\u201d is a nebulous policy - and, for what it\u2019s worth, is actually nowhere explicitly within the application flow - and I appreciate the opportunity for us to get more explicit and offer clearer guidelines to the community. My initial reaction to the situation is that we will have to set objective guidance, and I don\u2019t think some of the current proposed solutions lend themselves to that. For example:     David_Dyor:  My logic is based on the original reason a project creates a token. If it appears the token was created for governance purposes, not revenue-generation, then imo it should be eligible.   Everything in Web3 moves extremely quickly, and what was originally conceived as a governance token can very quickly turn into an extremely valuable tradable asset. As a result, I disagree with intent at token creation being the right yes/no barometer. And, even if it were, assessment of the team\u2019s intent at time of token creation is highly subjective and extremely difficult to discern.     David_Dyor:  \u201cGrant Applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens.\u201d   This suggestion is clearer and more explicit, but IMO, this is still far too inclusive. There are projects with governance tokens that have billions in market cap and certainly do not meet the ethos of Gitcoin grants, based on their stage. I do not think governance tokens as an arbitrary cutoff makes sense for that reason. I don\u2019t think the existence of a token alone should preclude a project from being part of Gitcoin Grants; as you suggest, @David_Dyor, the landscape has evolved and many, many early-stage projects that I believe the community would deem eligible for grants do have small token experiments. That said, we have to draw the line somewhere. A couple suggestions, perhaps, to get the ball rolling:   What if we allowed governance tokens that have not yet crossed a certain market cap? E.g., market cap has never been above $20M   I also still believe that VC funding is a material, measurable event that often greatly shifts a project\u2019s priorities. I am in favour of keeping something like the $500K VC funding threshold (I would perhaps up that amount, but would love to hear what the community thinks).   TLDR: I\u2019d propose we work towards some combination of objective metrics like the above two. These will, inevitably, be somewhat arbitrary - and we\u2019ll likely need to experiment and adjust - but in order to scale this program and our approval process, we need to get explicit and start somewhere.

Hence why we really need to decouple side rounds (cause or eco) from the main pool in the future - ideally before gr14. But I think there are plenty of reasonable cases where a project has a token but didn\u2019t do a large fundraise (or a fundraise of any kind). Also \u201ctoken\u201d is getting vaguer all the time. NFTs are tokens. Voting/governance tokens, non-transferable tokens - just having a token doesn\u2019t always imply a large treasury to fund a project. So I think it\u2019s really a case-by-case situation. A fundraise or liquidity event should def be a pivotal moment, but even so, I think a project that raises a $200k seed round or something could arguably still qualify. There are projects that may have gotten large grants from other programs, non-profits that are funded via donations, maybe a project won a big hackathon prize, the line is blurry. If I had to draw a line, I\u2019d say raising > $500k should def disqualify you. ",

David_Dyor:  My logic is based on the original reason a project creates a token. If it appears the token was created for governance purposes, not revenue-generation, then imo it should be eligible.

It would be awesome if we could separate those, but seeing how the space moves, in some cases this could prove impossible\u2026 Everybody is launching a \u201cgovernance\u201d token  So atm I kinda agree with @DisruptionJoe\u2019s comment, this is GOLD and really captures the essence of this whole discussion all from a more \u201cpractical\u201d and bottom/up perspective:     DisruptionJoe:  Working on the frontier of web 3 is exciting, but sometimes it means we are making this up as we go. Our legitimacy at this point isn\u2019t from following the letter of the law, but from having a clear purpose, communicating our decisions in the post round governance briefs, and getting better round over round. I see no reason why a rule that I wrote about a year ago which has seen  uses thus far can\u2019t be mended to provide the proper intention of our policy. As we have matured, we have realized the need for a system based in English common law which can remove bias and provides a pathway for updating our precedent. Once this system is fully in place, then we can be 100% letter of the law, but we are still building that system now. This community (ethereum/gitcoin) went through the DAO hard fork and realized that code isn\u2019t law. In this case, the law isn\u2019t law yet because it isn\u2019t built on a solid substrate that is resilient to outside pressures.   That\u2019s actually the way we handled all the situations thus far, but I agree that we should have a more \u201cclear\u201d policy or GE criteria in the near future. Personally as a former \u201cgrant reviewer\u201d I know from my experience that there are a LOT of cases that could be labeled as a \u201cdouble standard\u201d. @connor\u2019s vision could be a solution, namely separating the main and cause/ecosystem\u2019s rounds eligibility criteria and processing, but won\u2019t that just expand the \u201cdouble standard\u201d scenario to the ecosystem/cause rounds? Like, selling a novel use case NFT would be ok in the climate round, but the same thing would be forbidden in the main round if they use the funds made after selling the NFT to build houses or smth like that(which doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own round yet). Maybe I\u2019m taking this to far  Thanks for starting this hard conversation @David_Dyor ! This has been an area of great uncertainty and it still is\u2026 ",

                    "content": "    kyle:  want to make sure we aren\u2019t talking past each other here, @DisruptionJoe - Grants that have tokens, or even VC funding, I feel should still be \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cvisible\u201d on the platform. Users should have the option to fund them (ideally the Grant owner is clear about this fact though), and if there are clear disqualifying criteria they should be marked inactive/no longer visible.   Yes. This is my understanding as well.     kyle:  In this case, I feel BrightID should be active on the platform, but \u201cis CLR eligible\u201d should be disabled. These are options in the admin so folks see that we have multiple options:   For reasons outlined above, I\u2019ve set them to \u201cactive\u201d AND \u201cclr Eligible\u201d for now with the potential outcomes listed above based on us executing the full appeal. This isn\u2019t a call of if they should or shouldn\u2019t be eligibile. It is only a call to allow them the same opportunity to earn for their grant they would normally considering the evidence and effort combined with the overwhelming desire of the community in our research. It doesn\u2019t mean that the appeal will be upheld or that they will be \u201cclr eligible\u201d at the end of the round.     kyle:  I do agree with @annika that setting thresholds and clarifying this would be wonderful. I appreciate that the BrightID Grant is a strong impetus for us to do this. When we launched GTC, the goal was to have PGF define these criteria and then have FDD help confirm compliance.   Setting the thresholds in an arbitrary and lightly defined way is already happening. The complexities of the side rounds needing to be included in the main ethereum round is what is causing many of the gray area policy issues. There are also a few where I or Kevin made a decision in the past that ended up as a soft precedent, but isn\u2019t written or defined. The policy squad is looking to complete the audit and rewrite the full policy this season. From there it can be updated via the appeals system rather than arbitrary judgement calls from our or PGF team. Are we both on the same page that an appeals system to update precedent using the english common law model is a path we should continue on? Lastly, I  agree with you that PGF should own the policy in the future, specifically grants operations. Let\u2019s talk more about this in CSDO. ",

With FDD, we have been creating more transparency and community participation, but when a grants policy or sybil defense decision needs to be made it has fallen mostly on me. Now that we are communicating in this transparent forum, I am worried people will see me making a decision and claim \u201cthat isn\u2019t decentralized!\u201d I don\u2019t want anyone to get the impression that I feel I have the authority and am abusing it. The number of decisions that were required in the past 5 rounds was enormous. Most of the time, I would seek input from the team where my concerns were heard, but no one was interested in participating in making these decisions. Issues which are causing problems now like the attachment of the main round and ethereum round are issues I have been calling out since GR8. Even during GR11 the PGF group wasn\u2019t running the grants ops yet. Not to complain at all. I just want the public forum readers to know I\u2019m not a benevolent dictator. I\u2019m more the benevolent guy who happened to be in the role of responsibility to make sure shit didn\u2019t hit the fan! ",

E.g., market cap has never been above $20M   Excellent idea I totally agree.  This can be another variable that ecosystems can use to shape their rounds.     ZER8:  won\u2019t that just expand the \u201cdouble standard\u201d scenario to the ecosystem/cause rounds?   While it expands the double standard out to the ecosystems it also pushes some reviewing responsibility to the ecosystem (depending on curation model).  So reviewers will be able to lean on the ecosystem reps for fringe case help.     DisruptionJoe:  I don\u2019t want anyone to get the impression that I feel I have the authority and am abusing it. The number of decisions that were required in the past 5 rounds was enormous.   I don\u2019t feel that way at all.  You did an incredible job building out the dao.  I kinda wish you had gone even farther down the Centralization path during the last 6 months.  Because herding cats isn\u2019t easy.  We were trying to do very serious consequential work and yet in the early days tbh there were a lot of clueless folks trying to figure out how to be a dao, myself included.  I think if you had been more bossy we might have skipped a couple challenges\u2026at great cost ofc. I feel the same about the GPG.  I trust them and I want their explicit guidance to build this thing right.  I suppose imo the ends justify the means.  We can always improve our decentralization but if we don\u2019t succeed operationally our decentralization debt is meaningless.  I am aware that some people feel differently, feel that maximum decentralization is needed. ",

If the above discussion is any indication of the appeal process, I think it basically worked. Although, I think we can all admit that this level of discussion cannot happen very often. My preference would be to see this type of decision pushed off onto the community. Maybe some way to say to the donors, \u201cThis grant has been flagged as XYZ. Do you wish to help us decide?\u201d Or, \u201cDo you think this grant should be eligible for matching\u2026\u201d (Just thinking out loud.) Also, I don\u2019t feel any time pressure to get this done. As Joe points out this can be completed before the end of the round and, if I understand, no action means they get the match. This goes along with Ostrom\u2019s principle of \u201cpunish infractions lightly at first and then ramp up\u2026\u201d I like that. ",

Yes, we are (I believe). \u2013 I hate to be the stick in the mud, but I feel like BrightID was rightfully denied matching funds as their project has launched a governance token, which at launch arguably acted more like a liquidity token by offering several yield farming mechanics as well   So, haven\u2019t read all the comments yet, but if this is the case, we\u2019re being inconsistent here. Giveth is up & running and receiving matching. And they have an entire tokenomics system set up (giveconomy) BanklessDAO the exact same thing, they have 11 related grants up if I see it correctly, most important one being Bankless Academy I think. All are receiving matching funds. (pretty sure there are many more, these are just the ones that popped up) Edit: Reading up, definitely like Annika\u2019s proposal here & hope this can indeed be owned by the grants team. Great to see this discussion.     annika:  TLDR: I\u2019d propose we work towards some combination of objective metrics like the above two. These will, inevitably, be somewhat arbitrary - and we\u2019ll likely need to experiment and adjust - but in order to scale this program and our approval process, we need to get explicit and start somewhere   ",
