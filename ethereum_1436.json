It allows multiple types of fungible tokens to be sent to multiple receiving addresses via our proposed interface `transferBatchMul` and allows multiple types of fungible tokens to be sent from multiple sending addresses to multiple receiving addresses via our proposed interface `transferFromBatchMul`. This standard greatly reduces the gas consumption in transactions of multiple types of fungible tokens. In addition the standard allows both setting of an approval for a single token via an interface `approve(uint256 id,address spender, uint256 amount)` and setting of approvals uniformly for all types of  tokens via an interface `approve(address spender,bool _status)`.  ## Motivation      This file has been truncated. show original        github.com/ethereum/EIPs         Eip-3712: Standard for Multiple Types of Fungible-Tokens   ethereum:master \u2190 naturaldao:Eip-Branch            opened 10:57AM - 10 Aug 21 UTC               1999321             +340 -0       When opening a pull request to submit a new EIP, please use the suggested templa\u2026te: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md  We have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs.
