We\u2019d like to move forward by creating a vote on Snapshot in the following days that will contain an updated and simplified version for the proposal and budget request that you can find below.  Notes and history:  We\u2019ve decided to rename Discovery to dCompass. Initial RFP from @owocki: Request for Proposal: Decentralize Gitcoin Quests  Initial proposal [PROPOSAL] - Gitcoin Discovery: Decentralize the Knowledge Base & Quests - #15 by Huxwell     Abstract This proposal offers integration of dCompass to the Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream also know as dGitcoin. dCompass\u2019 primary mission will be to onboard, guide and educate users about:   the Gitcoin ecosystem   sustainable open source software & trustworthy Web3 protocols and tools   decentralization & governance   DeFi & NFTs   Our workstream will be responsible for decentralizing and improving the Gitcoin Quests, which will become dQuests, as well as the Gitcoin Knowledge Base, which will become dKnowledge.   dKnowledge will contain educational information and FAQs about the Gitcoin ecosystem, Web3 projects, and technologies.   The content within the Knowledge Base will be used to populate quest preparation materials.   dQuests will display the content from dKnowledge in a more engaging way and it will reward users for validating their learnings and actions. Built on a decentralized infrastructure, dQuests is a gamified platform where users will be able to progress through various types of quests\u2014like quizzes, code challenges, and on-chain transactions\u2014gaining the ability to verify their diverse skillsets .  E9RPE4gXsAQr2yo (1)1926\u00d71041 134 KB  see initial prototype - HackFS Hackathon Finale live demo   By successfully completing a quest, users will be able to:   earn XPs and increase their ranking   mint Quest & Badge NFTs with a random rarity   and grow their Dynamic Skill Tree NFT by validating their learnings and actions through on-chain micro-credentials.  Frame 12032\u00d71183 332 KB         Motivation  As the Gitcoin DAO expands, we believe there are 3 main problems that need to be solved:   Aggregating ever-growing but scattered information   Retaining users and community members/contributors   DAO project management, contributor management, and intuitive onboarding   Once the changes are implemented:   Contributors will be motivated to perform certain tasks on the Gitcoin Knowledge Base, such as:   suggest edits   suggest translations,   update information, etc.     The implementation of Quest, Badge, and Skill Tree NFTs will add an incentive layer for platform users and DAO contributors to engage with the ecosystem.   Platform users can be onboarded to the GitcoinDAO and to Web3 projects easily with verified skills and interests.   Platform users can trade their quests & badge NFTs.    Specification   Roadmaps Our short-term roadmap (which is what the current funding\u2019s for) is the following: Q4 2021 Roadmap  Q4939\u00d7316 7 KB  To see the broader roadmaps refer to the pages below: dQuests Roadmap dKnowledge Roadmap Maintenance and Upgrade Plan: Our team will update any library that we use on a continual basis. We will provide maintenance for the overall availability and security of the dApp. This will include bug fixes, monitoring, upgrades to major versions of tools such as Chainlink v2, new web3.storage releases, et al. We will also be looking for ways to enhance our existing features.  What do you need from Gitcoin and when?   We are requesting a total of 26145 GTC for Q4, allocated gradually upon milestone completion, to see the budget and range of activities in detail refer below: Q4 2021 Budget Request  Q4-budget995\u00d7573 25.6 KB    Vote  FOR - If you vote \u201cyes\u201d, the dCompass Workstream will be created within the Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream, and the proposed budget above will be allocated to the multisig of the dCompass Workstream. AGAINST - If you vote \u201cno\u201d, the dCompass Workstream won\u2019t be created, and the requested budget won\u2019t be allocated. ",

He took that build and combined it with the effort the FDD User Support group on building out an open source knowledgebase using sourcecred. This is the next step in that process. We should set a precedent that those who give first and contribute are given the autonomy to guide a project. The second reason is because the system is needed. Gitcoin\u2019s current Knowledgebase is on HappyFox, a closed source ticket management system. While the ticketing system might be best with a paid SaaS solution, it is hard for me to think that an open source knowledge base wouldn\u2019t be better. This also connects to the DAO experience. By connecting the knowledge to Quests, it allows any squad to have a decentralized verification that a contributor has done the proper training to participate at a high level. This is an excellent proposal. Huxwell understands complexity and his instincts for DAO culture and operational execution are second to none. I\u2019m here to see what people like him can do when our community unlocks the potential talent they have. ",

It also makes me happy that the learning can be self-paced and can possibly rely on both incentivized and non-incentivized mechanisms as needed. Also, it holds true to the multi-faced nature of DAOs where one \u201ccombined\u201d action is leading to multiple outputs of onboarding, contribution and contributor management, learning, a compilation of info and view-points from multiple actors, honestly once successfully implemented, many more processes can be experimented with a similar framework. I think the plug-and-play contribution opportunity will also pull in more diverse and niche participation. GitcoinDAO can really make use of such an initiative, imo, it will increase participation as well as improve the efficiency of \u201cwork done\u201d in general. ",

Q4 2021 retrospective Contributors: 5 full-time & 6 part-time Funds spent: 11 859 GTC Funds carrying over the next quarter: 14 286 GTC Have the actions of the workstream brought back value into the DAO/treasury? Not yet but we do expect to generate value and revenue by the end of Season 13. Milestone 1 & 2 achievements  - [v] = success      [x] = failure [v] Enable user to create a new project [v] Enable project owner to create a pathway and/or a quest (bonus: anyone can submit a pathway or a quest and project owners can approve or reject those) [v] Build Github action for uploading files to Filecoin and IPFS (kudos to @kammerdiener that fixed a blocking issue with the Github action) [v] Enable image upload using Web3.storage & NFT.storage [v] Control access of access, approvers and minting of NFTs [v] Keep track of pending eligible addresses for future minting [v] Use identity-link services to link Github account to DID & Ethereum Address (bonus: Twitter account linking) [x] Will track contributors activity using a sourcecred instance for the Knowledge Base The sourcecred integration with the Github repo was a failure because not all contributors would commit directly to the Knowledge Base. An alternative would be to handle some part of the compensations based on a #did-a-thing channel on Discord where contributors can post their work and others react with emojis. For now we\u2019re compensating contributors based on human evaluation but we\u2019re always willing to experiment new compensation frameworks. A great product person recently joined us for Q1 and we will work with contributors to create, document and evaluate tasks. Based on the evaluation of the task we\u2019ll assign it a weight and a budget which could lead to a more meritocratic compensation system. [x] Gitcoin Gitbook Knowledge Base v1     Huxwell:  Our workstream will be responsible for decentralizing and improving the Gitcoin Quests , which will become dQuests , as well as the Gitcoin Knowledge Base , which will become dKnowledge.   dKnowledge will contain educational information and FAQs about the Gitcoin ecosystem, Web3 projects, and technologies.     Some clarification on dKnowledge, I was naive and did make a mistake thinking that we could have an open source web3 knowledge base with that much information and different stakeholders in such a short timeframe. It would be more reasonable to keep the Gitcoin Knowledge Base as a project internal to Gitcoin (support + core/knowledgable members). So dKnowledge is more shifting towards a squad of digital/crypto native content writers and translators that can create handbooks, tooling guides and onboarding steps  \u2192 GitBook still needs to replace the current Gitcoin support page but the current state of the Gitbook is that we have all the previous FAQs on there, available in English, Chinese and French. In addition to that, the dKnowledge squad is working on handbooks to facilitate onboarding in the Gitcoin DAO and its tools and workstreams. January 2022 update  Last friday we\u2019ve deployed our staging app https://dcompass-staging.herokuapp.com/ (it works better on the devs computer but there\u2019s a demo video coming soon) We\u2019re still actively working on it but it can be used to dogfood the product and hopefully to demo an alpha release for Schelling Point. All the projects, pathways, guides etc are there for testing purposes and we do not claim to be partners of any brand that is present on the platform. If you run into any problem or have suggestions, please create an issue on Github Issues \u00b7 Discovery-Labs/dCompass \u00b7 GitHub  Work in progress and focus for Q1 2022 is mainly around pricing for projects, pathway/quest completion and reward allocation & distribution. We\u2019re still actively looking for devs and UX/UI designers.  Thanks for your support!    ",

I invite you to watch this recent demo to understand the structure dCompass - YouTube but those are the 3 main entities:   Project   Pathway (collection of quests within a project)   Quest (challenge within a pathway)       kyle:  More specifically, does this solve one of the identified problems?   Yes, I do think that it would help a lot of people to understand what a project is about by having fun instead of being overwhelmed.     kyle:  I was also surprised by the fee to post a project. Why have you decided to charge people to post projects?   The pricing page is still a work in progress but the idea behind this is to make sure people aren\u2019t spamming project submissions because each project goes through a review process before being \u201cpublished\u201d on the dApp. It is also a way of creating revenue without extracting value from the end user.     kyle:  One of the customary actions for all things being built by the Gitcoin Community is to use some call out that it is being built by the Gitcoin Community. I wonder if you are trying to keep this independent or affirm you are part of Gitcoin through this work?   I will change the footer to reflect that it\u2019s built by the Gitcoin Community and I can affirm we\u2019re part of Gitcoin through this work. However, when the project will be mature enough, we plan to create Discovery DAO. The responsibilities of that DAO will be to maintain and govern the dCompass project. ",
