Before starting a formal Signal Request for the creation of a discord server, I thought it would be useful to have a preliminary discussion, to sense if there is a real interest. Some elements to consider before answering the informal poll:  Rocket.chat has worked fine in the last few years in that it kept the community kind of \u2018shielded\u2019 from meme-boys. This kind of reflects the culture of MakerDAO based on very polite discussion, generally well-educated etc. At the same time, Discord is the standard chat platform of all Crypto (and not just crypto). It would simplify the life of many, and surely will attract many new people. Ultimately this is (imho) a good thing. In large numbers you find all types of people, including good/useful/serious ones. We will probably have to organise properly: several channels, moderators, bots, etc. This will require time/energies.  At the same time, though, SourceCred already supports Discord (@s_ben) and we could reward valuable Discord-activity (like moderation) with cred.  In general I love the calm environment of rocket.chat, but I think it is terrible for some tasks (e.g., searching old discussions). All in all, I am probably favourable to move to discord.    Would you like to have an official MakerDao Discord server rather than the current Rocket.chat?  YES NO ABSTAIN     0 voters     ",

I should add one point:  In discord it is possible to restrict access to some channels only to some authorised users.  I think it would be reasonable to create a channel reserved to people with >k (K any threshold considered sufficient) cred so to have a basic filter. In some discord servers I have even saw channels accessible only if you have >K tokens of a certain type, etc. ",

On the other hand I do appreciate the more calm and reasonable chat in MakerDAO but I never really connected that to the chat app used, I just imagined that\u2019s because of a somewhat more mature community and general culture. If that was indeed connected to the Rocket.chat I would vote \u201cno\u201d  As mentioned, voted \u201cyes\u201d out of selfish reasons, but I would ultimately rather leave the choice to the chat moderators and maintainers.

Probably highest visibility - pretty much every project has a presence.  There are pros and cons to being there.  Not sure SC helps much because I know people/groups are already gaming SC instances across the board.    Moderation definitely required. Honestly one has to ask the question - what is the goal of more access?   More people joining in (this has pro\u2019s/cons).  I will say via discord 1Hive has probably doubled it\u2019s developers.  I am not sure they would have gotten more people any other way. I agree with @jernejml that one would want to keep rocketchat up at least for searching.  Rarely I go back in conversations looking for links to things etc. Since my approach is becoming \u2018less is more\u2019 I am tending to pull back from most if not all on-line activities and focusing on other things.   Others are doing more but the on-line work, governance, investing space is broadening dramatically so I am fully expecting a general dilution of people in places over time unless they are growing massively or there is huge interest. It is more difficult to get things done at Maker than in other projects hence there is a higher barrier to entry.  That also has pros/cons. I probably will vote abstain and let the rest of the community decide.    There literally are too many platforms for work, communication etc. now and I don\u2019t think one community can do them all without significant effort and expense both financially and personally. Just think about the goals with branching out into other communication channels. ",
