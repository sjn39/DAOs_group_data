Daaps pay for RPC throughput by staking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on RPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that is created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node runners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and strengthening the overall RPC service. This model reduces central points of failure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution, redundancy, and censorship resistance. We currently support over 38 blockchain networks, including many popular EVM protocols. For real-time network data visit: https://www.poktscan.com/. By sponsoring daap\u2019s usage of Pocket RPC within the Optimism community we are contributing to decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship resistance of the network. Pocket expedited support for Optimism on 13/06/2022 after feedback from the community regarding problems with existing RPC services. Since then we have not rate-limited the public Optimism endpoint and our Optimism traffic has grown day by day and recently broke into our top 10 chains by relays (currently at 40m relays per day), signaling the service to value to the Opti community and builders.  POKTscan803\u00d7262 24.2 KB  Providing this service is unsustainable and as we launch our paid strategy at the end of September, rate-limits across all public infra will be introduced and we are therefore seeking support from Foundations to continue to operate high-quality public goods. As opposed to other providers / running your own nodes, investing in Pocket in not a sunk cost but rather just an opportunity cost - POKT must be purchased and staked to utilize the protocol, but this POKT is owned by Foundation and this investment can be recouped (subject to POKT token price fluctuations) on the open market at any time the OP Foundation wishes.

No Number of OP tokens requested: 185,185 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No Proposal for token distribution: 123,456 for delivering network support via our network of 30K full nodes throughout the world and fixed overhead costs in maintaining the service 61,729 for on-going throughput (currently at 40m relays per day) which will be exchanged for POKT in order to be staked on our network to receive the current bandwidth of relays. This is effectively a token swap and OP Foundation would own the POKT stake that they can request be unstaked and transferred to them at any time if the service is no longer needed. If we were unsuccessful in our proposal to secure retroactive funding, we would still want to continue to support the network and therefore in an effort to do so sustainable, we would introduce performance limits that would channel users to our paid tiers in our portal where costs would be passed on to Opti-builders.

                    "content": "hi @marc! Thank you for your feedback. I see your point - part of this proposal does seek retroactive funding for the work already completed in spinning up support for Optimism so our network of node runners were incentivised to start receiving relays. I would be happy to separate this part of the proposal at your request if preferred. I was unaware of this and unable to find info online that details it. This would be super helpful. Thank you. The second part of this proposal is focused on future usage and growth. Currently our publicly exposed endpoints for Optimism are doing 44m relays per day (1.2B per month - thousands of dollars per month on an enterprise plan). This represents another 10% growth since I originally submitted this proposal. Optimism is one of our fastest growing networks. To sustain this growth we have two options in front of us:   The first is to request support from foundations as we have done here. This would allow us to stake POKT on behalf of the Foundation and Optimism builders would be able to continue to utilise this public good for the next 24 months.   If the grant application is unsuccessful, we would rate-limit the public endpoint at our free tier (250K relays per day - a drastic cut from the current 44M per day) to encourage builders to sign up for a paid plan with us or a competitor (hopefully us). This is necessary for us to cover costs of the every-growing ecosystem of networks we support as we can\u2019t continue to offer such a high number of relays for free.   Therefore this application is directly contributing to the growth of the Optimism ecosystem over the next 2 years in a substantial way. I have two questions:  Is it preferred I split this into two applications although they are intrinsically linked? When does this growth grant application round end and the next retroactive funding phase begin?  Thanks, @duckie3351 ",

Indeed, retroactive funding phase hasn\u2019t been announced. There\u2019s no set date yet announced from the Optimism Foundation as far as I am aware. You can read about it more here.      duckie3351:  The first is to request support from foundations as we have done here.     If you are requesting support and funding directly form the Optimism Foundation, there\u2019s a specific form to fill in order to get a partner\u2019s grant. This is part of the 5.4% of the OP token supply dedicated to the partner fund. Find the form here   A proposal submitted on gov.optimism.io is part of the Governance fund, voted and discussed by the community, and eventually voted on by the Token House, or governance participants.       duckie3351:  When does this growth grant application round end and the next retroactive funding phase begin?    Cycle 8 has already began and votes are on snapshot. Cycle 9 will be dedicated to grants council and protocol delegation program proposals. January 19th: Season 3 starts with Voting Cycle #10. See more here.  That being said, I do see that you can both try to reach out for a partners fund, as well as ask for a grant from the governance fund cycle #10 incentivizing usage of your RPC endpoints. I will give you my feedback, and you can feel free to take it or adjust it based on your judgement. A better proposal from Pocket imho would:   Encourage new builders to deploy to Optimism with its RPC endpoints. The funds would be used for the usage of RPC endpoints for projects that haven\u2019t deployed yet on Optimism.   Encourage previously deployed projects to continue using your RPC endpoints. Part of of the grant is to subsidize your RPC endpoints (34% for example), while another paid by developers (33%), and the rest 33% you can offer as co-incentives. Letting developers pay for your would validate that you are offering a superior product than the free tiers of other providers.   Not encourage exchanging the grant received for POKT token. The community isn\u2019t a fan of dumping governance grant for other protocols tokens. I tired understanding why there needs to be a token for validators to run a node but I wasn\u2019t able to. You probably have a very clear answer, so if there\u2019s an absolute need to exchange OP for POKT, I would clarify it clearly in your proposal.   ",
