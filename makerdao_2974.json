VWAP1418\u00d7572 40.3 KB   Volume at around $333 million this last week  . Average VWAP (Volume-Weighted-Average-Price) places Dai at $1.001.      ETH vaults collateralization ratio rising with the price rally.    Liquidation Walls at $324 ETH.    Witness the steepness, where a $6 price decline pushes liquidations off the cliff. Other vaults collateralization ratios are close to 200% (WBTC, LINK, etc.) and require a much more significant price decline to be relevant threats.
