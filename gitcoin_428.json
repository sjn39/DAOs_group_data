Using DeFi protocols we can extend the treasury\u2019s capital and maximize the impact of public goods funding.  We have some heavy hitters of the DeFi space who have stood up to be Stewards so I am confident we can put together a good strategy to effectively tackle this.  This also happens to co-inside with some work we are doing at PleasrDAO.

Austin and Kevin have worked together in a few diff capacities in the past.   Austin and Kevin met through the EIP 1337 working group back in 2018, where Austin built the first MVP of EIP 1337 which was later part of an early Gitcoin Grants Prototype. A\u2026         [Workstream] Public Goods Funding and Treasury Management Public Goods Funding       Hey all!  Over the last few years, Gitcoin has been building solutions around how we fund the public goods we care about, most successfully using quadratic funding, a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018.  The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, q\u2026         Workstream suggestion: I need a better name for this \ud83e\uddd9 \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion       One common thread that I see in all of Gitcoin\u2019s initiatives is a dedication to trying to rally around and create positive-sum games. The original bounties platform sought to create win-win situations between those who needed work and those who wanted to supply it, reducing coordination costs and enhancing ecosystem efficiency. Grants seeks to make giving funds fun, and create a positive-sum game around funding the ecosystem.

This post serves as my resume for the lead position and as a means for you to hold me accountable to the high bar you would expect from a workstream this critical to Gitcoin.  Though I am relatively new to Gitcoin, I am definitely not new to open source or the decentralization space. My intro to crypto and decentralization was when I j\u2026     all have different proposals about what types of community members should get involved, so id probably start there to learn about how you can get involved also if u come hang out on the community call tomorrow we can just chill + see what ideas come up there https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1397977519895236617 ",
