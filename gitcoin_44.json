I\u2019ve been working on scaling & decentralizing the context I have about Gitcoin by authoring a bunch of posts on the governance forum.  As of present day, I\u2019ve authored 161 posts in order to do so. I\u2019d love to know what you want to hear from me, in order to decentralize the selection of which context I provide to the DAO. So here goes.  Ask me anything. Comment below, or if you want to ask an anonymous question you can use this form\u2026 I will answer as many questions as I am able to.  I will monitor this thread looking for new questions in the month of April. ",

I know that employment is an important financial use case for many people, and we know that web3/internet of money reinvents many financial use cases.  So from that we can deduce that employment will change because of the internet of money. Right now the trend seems to be working for DAOs. I think that question is too broad of a question for me to answer in depth here, but I think my bankless op-ed on the Internet of jobs covers some of my thoughts. ",

I hope I can contribute somehow. I\u2019ve read all the Discourse forum messages since 2021 but still would love to know your experience in a few subjects:   Given the freedom of working on DAOs, have you lost key members because they were found another opportunity that required most of their time?   If so, at this point is there anything implemented in GitCoinDAO for avoiding this?   Have you ever found a big group of holders (or single whale), voting/proposing against the interest/mission of the DAO?   Does the DAO looks like you imagine it would be when you started it?   ",

I\u2019m sure that many people have come & gone in general, but I am not aware of key contributors to workstreams moving on from GitcoinDAO without offboarding in an orderly way.     Layn:   Have you ever found a big group of holders (or single whale), voting/proposing against the interest/mission of the DAO?    I have not, but that doesnt mean that it\u2019s definitively not happening.  I\u2019d welcome anyone else on the thread calling this out / investigating it if they see it.     Layn:   Does the DAO looks like you imagine it would be when you started it?    The primary thing we were trying to solve with the QuadraticLands.com retro drop experience was enabling a group of Stewards who could be legitimate in governing Gitcoin Grants.    Most governance tokens have such low voter turnout, and by enabling delegation at the start, the idea was to evolve past this problem.  Here is who the community selected as stewards at the start of the DAO:  I was pretty happy with how that created a basis of legitimacy for the DAO. Beyond the structure that was set up at the start and the mission being an organizing principle, I did not have strongly held expectations for how the DAO would work.  Like otheres, I\u2019ve been trying to learn about DAOs ( see DAO Design Best Practices ) Egregores ( The Gitcoin/GitcoinDAO Egregore is Emerging ) work.   Just others, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how the dao as an entity scales its sensemaking. ",

FDD calls it the Source Council and is now using a peer-evaluation system called Coordinape to calculate a portion of the council members rewards.  It is the latest iteration of FDD governance and really is the best yet imo.  Question: The power & resource sharing between state or provincial government and the feds has been a contentious and divisive issue in the early days of the formation of USA and Canada.  I see parallels of this in the dao-space. It has been suggested digital-communities are a new form of nation without geo-political borders (\u2026so far groan).  It has also been suggested (thanks E.O.) that  groups benefit from a structure of multiple sub-groups due mostly to the fact large groups are harder to operate efficiently. Kevin, can you please talk about how you see the hard issues of power & resource sharing playing out in daos\u2026 Not looking for specific answers just thought exploration. Some wonderings I have about this area: Will traditional comprehensive lawyer-negotiated contracts be needed or can we find a newer way via smart contracts? If a sub-structure is attainable with advanced coordination tools why shouldn\u2019t most daos be sub-groups of the same parent-group?  The Public Goods Dao?  The New Globe Org?  (get it\u2026the new form of NGO haha?) Is the research about sub-groups current or has it been superseded? Thanks for your time Kevin. ",

As someone still learning, a lot of the values of Web3 that are discussed often seem cultural and impossible to program into our money \u2013 what are the values we can program into our money?    I think that with a turing complete smart contract language and oracles that put info on chain, you could plausibly program really any value into money (in theory).  But the ecosystem is only a few years old + not mature enough for that to happen yet. In the meantime, tools for creating intersubjective consensus (like CoordinAPE, Gitcoin Grants, CLRFund) are a nice shim to make sure that financial rewards match our values. Also checkout How do we scale our sensemaking? - which I think has some novel ideas about how to measure what we value.     umarkhaneth:   If you could only recommend one book to someone getting into Web3, what book would it be and why?    Depends on context, their skillset, interests, and background.  Also their reason for getting into the space.
