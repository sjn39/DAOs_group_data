Prior Facilitator: Robert Jordan @monkey.irish Prior Facilitator Term: 2021-09-27 to 2022-11-20 Interim Facilitator: @retro Interim Facilitator Appointment: 2022-11-28 Assessment Period for this Report: 2022-11-28 - 2022-12-14  CES Contributor Impact After being notified of the Interim Facilitator ratification, I conducted one-on-one interviews with all available CES-001 contributors. All CES contributors held meetings on Monday, 28-Nov, except for Robert & Nikolaj. The initial meeting focused on what was required to get the Core Unit fully up and running again and on target to deliver the approaching December Spell. The team proactively took steps over the week without a facilitator to stand up the necessary software tooling to be operational and continued working as a six-person team (minus Nikolaj and Robert). The team informed me that Nikolaj was taking a leave of absence due to personal reasons. The remaining team also expressed a continued desire to work with him should he want to return to the team. Due to terminations and severance cited in Robert\u2019s offboarding post, mixed compensation statuses were reported for November. I assured the CES team that all previous terminations would be reassessed to stabilize the team, meaning MKR Vesting would continue to follow the governance-approved program and Dai compensation for November would be made whole. If any personnel changes were required, they would be conducted after a thorough review. CES, practically speaking, resumed full operations by Tuesday 29-Nov thanks to this team\u2019s proactiveness.  CES Work Impact CES-001 was focused on producing deliverables for three categories of work:  The December 9th Spell (originally planned for the 7th) included onboarding BlockTower and GNO and the offboarding of renBTC. Providing an input conduit and RWA jar for GUSD rewards was on track and targeted delivery by December 5th. Several supporting functions for collaterals were also in scope, including performing joint testing with SocGen, Collateral Status Index management, and technical assessments for MIPs.  The December Spell was delivered on time, the RWA jar is ready to receive rewards, the SocGen testing occurred, and the MIP81 technical assessment has been recently released.  CES Endgame & Transformation for the Future The catalyst for CES\u2019s disruption was credited both in the forums and through conversations with the team as solely related to Endgame. The team discussed the transformation to an Ecosystem Actor or potential SubDAO over the past several months, with a more in-depth discussion recently held at DevCon. My initial conversations with the team showed support for multiple paths forward and an overall desire to continue contributing to the project. The discussion I led in the first days of my new role was focused on the challenges facing CES\u2019s pivot; area of expertise, competitive advantages, budgets, and customer-driven (MakerDAO) demand. In an effort to leverage the experience the team has with the opportunity endgame creates, the best path forward identified was creating an Ecosystem Actor that focused on supporting smart contract development work for both MakerDAO\u2019s operations and product pipeline entering into 2023.  Immediate Next Steps to Support Endgame Alignment I made the difficult decision to end the working relationships with Mabel @zmtong, David @dbkcan, and Arnulfo @agtaghoyjr from CES. Their final day with the Core Unit is December 15th, and their terminations are strictly due to budgetary reasons. The remaining developers at the Core Unit are fully prepared to continue the current operations into the new year and asks for support from the @strat-fin-core-unit and the @Risk-Core-Unit to facilitate a smooth transition of collateral management and tracking responsibilities CES has facilitated to date. Scheduling and mapping this transition is underway with these Core Units. I would like to publicly support Mabel, David, and Arnulfo\u2019s transition to a new team within MakerDAO or the web3 industry. Each of them brings unique and hands-on experiences working on the front lines of a complex DAO and one of the most ground-breaking functions at MakerDAO (the Collateral pipeline). I\u2019d encourage anyone looking for their skills to reach out to them directly.  CES-001 Capital at Transition After supporting the personnel and operations of the Core Unit, I conducted a budget audit to review the finances of the Core Unit. As mentioned on the forums, the first action taken was to re-configure the CES-Auditor wallet and the CES-Ops wallet to the informal best practices promoted by @SES-Core-Unit. Below are stats related to the CES wallets before my interim period. Reporting moving forward will utilize SES\u2019s Expense Dashboard. It should also be noted that CES\u2019s budget statements dating back to April 2022 are also uploaded to the SES Expense Dashboard. I am working with SES to properly upload the remaining Oct-21 through Mar-22 statements.

The goal was to ensure all funds were accounted for before assuming responsibility for the Core Unit\u2019s finances and signing powers.   DAI With the lack of data provided during the transition, the only conclusive result that can be reached is all funds, but 463 Dai are accounted for by the self-reported numbers provided by CES in Google Sheets and on GitHub. Moving forward, CES will immediately begin to follow SES\u2019s Auditor Framework. The modification of the CES-Auditor wallet has been completed as requested. The CES-Ops wallet was reconfigured, as discussed, with @amusingaxl now acting as a signer instead of @dbkcan (as initially reported in the forum). The Core Unit plans to use the approved funds through March 31, 2023 to support the transition to an Ecosystem Actor, and will seek budget through SPFs, a MIP40, or alternative approved funding mechanisms for Ecosystem Actors during the Endgame transition.  MKR The MKR Investigation showed 907.97 MKR transferred from the CES-Ops wallet, with various degrees of acceleration to contributors. These transfers were stated within the powers of the prior facilitator in his offboarding post. The remaining members of CES are owed 154.67 MKR according to vesting schedules, awarded by March 1st. Some vests are already due, and all upcoming awards are due before the next approved vesting transfer date stated in CES\u2019s MIP40c3-SP30 (April 1st, 2023). To fulfill the expectations CES\u2019s contributors have been operating under since being hired, I intend to request 96.15 MKR in the January Spell to add to the MKR on hand in the CES-Ops Wallet in order to meet the contributor\u2019s MKR expectations and vests for their contributions at MakerDAO.  I am working with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit to pursue the needed governance actions to accomplish this. For context, a new initial forecast for CES MKR Vesting shows 386.675 MKR is scheduled to be vested over the life of the approved MIP (through October 1st, 2024) for its current contributors at current compensation. With the 907.97 MKR that has been transferred to date to CES contributors and the 386.675 MKR forecasted up for vesting, this would result in 1,294.645 MKR awarded over the life of the approved MIP40c3-SP30, well below the lower limit of the MIP approved amount.  CES Wallet Configurations Moving Forward CES Operational Wallet Quorum: 2:3 Active Signers: @amusingaxl, @retro, @juan CES Auditor Wallet Quorum: 2:2 Active Signers: SES Accountant Role, GovAlpha Auditor Role Beneficiary: MCD_Pause_Proxy 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB (1B Dai)  Interim Facilitator Role & Period My Interim Facilitator role has been focused on re-enabling the CES team, instilling governance confidence in the team\u2019s ability to deliver, and preparing the team for the future of Maker. With a clear direction for the future, supporting the team\u2019s transition to achieve this end state involves:  Coordinating the transition of Collateral Management work to better-fit Core Units. Enabling the team\u2019s contributions and ownership of engineering Endgame products. Operationalizing the team\u2019s new role within Spells and other \u2018operational\u2019 engineering work (still involving collaterals but in a different role). Supporting the transition of Core Unit to Ecosystem Actor through Governance.   One year runway As stated above, the CES Core Unit Budget is approved through the end of March, and after several forecasts, the currently approved funds in the CES stream and wallets enable almost a year\u2019s runway for the team. I am working with all applicable parties to understand the best course of action for the new team (mandate refresh or SPF-funded Ecosystem Actor). I will pursue those on the available timelines. This places my Interim Facilitator period on track to conclude in early April on the longest time horizon or sooner based on the best course of action and wishes of the current team members.  Interim Facilitator Notes & Recommendations Below are a few notes I wanted to capture and share in this report for record keeping. I plan to make concrete suggestions to MIPs and the pending Interim Facilitator amendment to continue improving our Governance system.  Core Unit Production Workspaces Upon the Facilitator\u2019s exit from CES, many subscriptions, communication platforms, and online workspaces needed to be transitioned to control of the contributors, requiring new subscriptions to be started, files to be transferred, and other logistical challenges. Robert supported a smooth transition, but this could have been much worse if this support was not there.  Contributor Information Determining contributor compensation, start dates, vesting, best contact methods, permissions, and other arrangements can be challenging without this information being documented in some trusted manner. Improvements to several MIPs would benefit an Interim Facilitator to act confidently without clear, verifiable information.  Multisig Wallet Configurations There are various multisig wallet configurations today at MakerDAO. The Budget Transparency Map highlights some of these configurations in use by Core Units, and it\u2019s easy to see a variety of setups in use. MIP55s also carry unique requirements. The need for a more standard approach in the near term is highlighted by reviewing CES-Ops wallet\u2019s multisig signer configurations. The original CES-Ops wallet configuration resulted in Robert controlling 2 out of the 3 signers needed for transactions. This can be determined by reviewing forum posts and self-announcements for address ownership.  CES-Ops Add/Change of Owner Events  2021-06-25: CES-Ops Wallet created by monkey.irish (0x5dB\u20267234)  2021-10-25: (0xDE0\u2026BdA1) added as the second signer 2021-10-31: Nikolaj (0x404\u202644B3) added as the third signer, and quorum increased to 2:3 for transactions. 2022-01-27: williamr publishes the RWF-001 Auditor Flow identifying (0xDE0\u2026BdA1) as Robert\u2019s wallet. 2022-05-09: (0x86f\u2026e5DF) added as a fourth signer, quorum set to 2:4 for transactions. 2022-05-10: (0x86f\u2026e5DF) removed monkey.irish (0x5dB\u20267234), quorum set to 2:3. 2022-11-20: monkey.irish states, \u201cRetiring Facilitator needs to be removed on the CES-001 multisig auditors wallet\" identifying (0x86f\u2026e5DF) as Robert\u2019s wallet. The signers at this time were:  Cmooney: 0xEeF3026eF864C9398c008195E65d16D9cb42a512  Nadia: 0xc8E6c287F6c127AFE5e4CB30bC440607b44c35f8  Marc-Andre:  0xf63EfEE2A663b04cB5a09De6E3EB910d8442131D  Presumed to be the retiring facilitator: 0x86f2c2f1A278EeBd92b16A69C4469731B4e3e5DF     Leaning into Endgame\u2019s strategy for accountability, more explicit rules governing multi-sigs and assessing a possible penalty should be considered if those rules are broken. Requiring all multi-sig wallets to meet MIP47 is a possible near-term solution. Additionally, as a compromise to ensuring Core Unit Operational continuity, an Accountant/Auditor Role could sit as the Beneficiary Role of an Ops wallet to pull funds back to Auditor control if something is discovered as potentially malicious.  The Auditor Role Although CES supported an Auditor-wallet configuration for their funds, their MIP did not dictate any review by auditors or their ability to withhold funds when transfers were requested (unlike the SES model where transparency reports need to match the MIP categories & on-chain transfers). This should highlight the term \u201cAuditor\u201d is not equal across Core Unit wallet configurations. Further definition of this role, requirements, potential compensation,  and overall trust relationships would give more confidence behind funds dedicated to a decentralized workforce to deliver value, especially as the DAO gears up to enable SubDAOs and Ecosystem Actors to request a budget for their transition into Endgame-ready teams. Additionally, the CES auditors performed 2 transfers in November to the Ops wallet. This may have been supported by information with the prior facilitator\u2019s request, but this would have topped up the Ops wallet to 648,419 Dai from 423,419 Dai. Even under the SES model, this would have been an acceptable request if the reconciliation process had been delayed. This highlights the benefits of a more refined transfer schedule the DAO could follow, especially when runways are enabled with the core fund transfer structure.  Not all Auditors are created equally Today, SES and GovAlpha are the two current Core Units that provide resources to support SES\u2019s designed Auditor Flow, with funds moving from an Auditor Wallet to an Operational Wallet for a Core Unit only after passing a rigorous review and reconciliation process. There are/were 6 Core Units with active budgets under this framework.  MKR Transfer Rules Today, MKR transfers for vesting have yet to have any general guiding rules in terms of implementation. DssVest has evolved into the preferred method for distributing Core Unit budgets; however, MKR is often manually transferred from the protocol to Core Units for vesting via a Spell. Ensuring better payment implementations would support the Protocol\u2019s confidence in these vesting payments and overhead for GovAlpha. They also remove the opportunity for misuse by a facilitator. The example from CES is Robert\u2019s accelerated vesting payouts of MKR. One transaction worth highlighting is 148.9 MKR paid out 5 months in advance to address 0x63D4d654a81f600D9eAC50E93438dd2FDf544322. When viewing this address in Gnosis safe, it lists the following addresses as Safe Owners (with a 2:3 quorum):  Robert Signer on CES Ops Wallet 2021-10-05 to end of term (0xDE0\u2026BdA1)  Robert Signer on CES Ops Wallet 2022-05-09 to end of term (0x86f\u2026e5DF)  Unknown 0xCFc2F4c64fB2e4F8370aE94592b1729d6ED12b22   To correct this risk, Auditors may have to play a more trusted role in the accounting and distribution of MKR. Otherwise, utilizing the tools the protocol has (DssVest) alongside educating and supporting better OpSec for contributors may be more beneficial than our current processes, and introduce more holistic improvements to our ecosystem.

I am working with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit to pursue the needed governance actions to accomplish this.   Thanks for providing this assessment @Retro - I have to admit I find it puzzling to read this. Does this mean funds (especially MKR) have been misused? ",

Always a bit tricky to weigh in on these, but I think by Robert\u2019s own admission, yes MKR was used outside of the rules of the CES Budget MIP. From my point of view, the \u201caccelerated vesting\u201d that took place was in violation of the 12-month cliff that was established. The only way to pull this off without asking governance for more MKR was to take from the recent transfer of 966.49 MKR. By giving it to people that hadn\u2019t met their cliff date, it was borrowing from those that had upcoming allocations due. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable position to say that with the circumstances a facilitator wanted to offer severance packages to the team. However, I don\u2019t think you can get around the fact that those severance packages used tokens that were clearly earmarked for a different vesting schedule. ",
