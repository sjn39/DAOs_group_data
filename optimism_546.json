Key information about Governance Fund grants 5.4% of the total initial token supply (231,928,234 OP) will be distributed to Optimism projects and communities via the Governance Fund.  A portion of the Governance Fund \u2026     Please read this post and, if desired, re-structure the grant in a way that follows those guidelines. It may also be worth noting that your grants appears to be more in-line with the \u201cbuilders subcommittee\u201d category. You can see more information about the builders category here and the growth experiments category here in order to decide which is best. Also, a general comment is that this grant appears to be doing A LOT of different activities. My advice would be to cut down the size of the grant and focus on one of the more specific aspects of it, such as running hackathons. Let me know if you have any questions, Michael ",
