It\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201c \u2013 Mark Twain Between now and 2045, a total of $84.4 trillion in wealth is expected to pass down either to beneficiaries or charity in the United States. What are they expected to do with all the wealth they inherit? One solution could be an annuity. A fixed interest annuity is a contract with a life insurance company that provides a guaranteed lifetime stream of income. It is like the Social Security Administration\u2019s monthly check. The product allows the annuitant to deposit a lump sum which will grow to provide retirement income later. The insurance company guarantees the rate of interest you will earn on money deposited in the annuity contract. These financial products are appropriate for investors who want income that they cannot outlive. For example, someone 55 years old looking to retire at 65 to receive their full benefits. They can use the income from the annuity to hold them over until age 65 and then receive two streams of income for the rest of their life. This might be a good choice for a lump sum you inherit or a lottery winner. However, it is not recommended for younger individuals or those with immediate income needs because invested cash is illiquid and subject to withdrawal penalties and fees. Deposits into annuity contracts are typically locked up for a period (surrender period) where the annuitant would incur a penalty if all or part of that money was touched. These periods can last anywhere from 2 to 10 years, depending on the particular product. Surrender fees can start at 10% or more and the penalty typically declines annually over the surrender period. For this reason, financial stability and reputation are important to consider when choosing an insurance company.

This is because premiums go to fund two components: the annually renewable term life insurance policy and the cash surrender value (CSV). The CSV is a fixed interest annuity in that it provides for a tax-free life-long stream of income (Taxation). The interest is determined by the weighted average yield of the insurance company\u2019s bond portfolio. As interest rates on US Treasuries increase, the dividends increase. As interest rates decrease, the dividends decrease. The term life policy is needed to satisfy the IRS\u2019s definition of a contract for life insurance which prevents it from being taxed.  CAGR1262\u00d7661 66.3 KB  Before 1988, customers of E.F. Hutton Life (credited for inventing universal life insurance) could dump hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars into a life insurance contract in one up-front payment. Consider that at this time interest rates and dividends were 11-12%. So if you were a high net worth individual with $500,000 you could be compounding your principal at $50,000 a year with no risk of losing your money, completely tax-free. And if that person needed the principal, they could take loans from the insurance policy on a tax-free basis. And those loans could last a lifetime, being paid back out of the eventual death benefit. For example, in the event, the insured dies with a $300,000 loan outstanding. The beneficiaries would receive the difference of $200,000.To slow the flow of funds into these products, the MEC rule came into being in 1988 after Congress passed the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act.  Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 12.10.58 AM989\u00d7402 243 KB  According to IRC \u00a77702, when a life insurance policy fails the 7-Pay Test which defines what a life insurance contract is it will be permanently reclassified as a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC). A MEC is an insurance contract that has lost all of its tax advantages such that any distributions taken are taxed Last In First Out just like an annuity. This is a result of depositing too much money into the life insurance contract too quickly. This meant that now customers of whole life policies have to pay a level premium for 7 years which is a certain ratio of the death benefit. For Universal Life policies, it is only 5 years to reach the max funding of the CSV. However, there is a way to circumvent this by using a 1035 Exchange which works similarly to a 1031 Exchange in real estate. You can deposit $50,000 or $100,000 Month 1 and Month 13 decide to exchange one insurance contract for another. This means that instead of depositing $20,000/year for 5 years to reach max funding, it can take 1 up-front payment and no more out-of-pocket premiums. You can access your CSV tax-free using a life insurance loan at any age, at any time, for any reason. This is a huge benefit of whole-life policies compared to 401(k)s and IRAs, which impose multiple obstacles if you want to access your cash before retirement, and penalize you if the funds you borrow from them are not paid back by a certain time and at a certain interest rate. No such obstacles exist with a whole-life policy. So leave your cash in the policy if you wish, or borrow it back out and use it, the choice is yours. Once the policy is in place, your insurance is guaranteed for the rest of your life. Many people assume they\u2019ll be able to buy new insurance at any point in their life. But nothing is further from the truth, if you become seriously ill, don\u2019t expect to be able to buy a new policy. This policy is all the assurance that you need to know that your family\u2019s financial well-being is set for life.  Lost Opportunity1430\u00d7953 183 KB  The whole life insurance policy contractually guarantees 2-4% Internal Rates of Return for the rest of your life. This might not seem like much but it\u2019s way more than your bank account. Remember the period from March 2000 to October 2002, when the Nasdaq lost 78% of its value? Pepperidge Farm remembers. If you had your money in your whole-life policy rather than directly invested in the Nasdaq, you would have outperformed by 82%. This is the value of uncorrelated assets compounding wealth consistently over a lifetime with no downside risk. Since there are no contribution limits, some refer to it as the Rich Man\u2019s Roth.  Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 3.35.27 PM1280\u00d7800 91.1 KB  If you treat the money in your life insurance contract as a savings account and the line of credit as a checking account, you can \u201cbecome your own banker\u201d just like Warren Buffet by loaning money to yourself and paying it back with interest over time. The point of this transaction is to use after-tax money to max fund a whole life policy. For instance, I originate a policy where I pay $10,000 a year for the next 7 years and have a total of $75,000 in Year 7. Next, I cross-collateralize the CSV of my whole life policies for a secured bank line of credit. At this point, I can borrow 95% of the CSV in my Guardian Life and MassMutual policies. The difference between borrowing from a third-party lender like M&M Bank at 3.7% versus lending my money to an insurance company at 6% means that I am earning a risk-free spread of about 2%. I deposit 100% of my income every 2 weeks which prevents future interest from accruing by paying down principal and satisfies the minimum quarterly interest-only payment which accelerates debt repayment. I only withdraw to spend and invest. Also, the interest paid to the bank is a tax deduction as a business expense. This deduction can allow you to recapture lost depreciation on big-ticket purchases like a car, house, tuition, wedding, business equipment, etc. Wouldn\u2019t you like to own a home in less time with no lien on that home? Since interest deductions were capped on mortgages, this makes the cash value line of credit even better than a HELOC for financing real estate.     New Collateral: Whole Life Insurance Collateral Onboarding       As a life insurance agent, I am well-versed in the virtues of dividend-paying whole life insurance policies issued by mutual insurance companies and recommend that they be added as collateral to MakerDAO. What is whole life insurance? [https://www.life-benefits.com/what-is-participating-whole-life-insurance/#:~:text=Participating%20whole%20life%20insurance%20]  Whole life insurance is a contract that is designed to remain in force for the insured\u2019s entire life and requires premiums to be paid ev\u2026     Insurance float is the difference between premiums received today over claims that must be paid many years in the future. During that time, the insurer invests the money. Insurance float is so valuable that insurance companies often operate at an underwriting loss\u2014that is to say, the premiums received are not enough to cover the eventual losses that must be paid and the expenses required to operate the business. Insurance float is like a loan and the underwriting loss is like the interest rate on that loan. Warren Buffett\u2019s GEICO, however, is so well run that the company\u2019s historical cost of float has been positive\u2026meaning Berkshire Hathaway is being paid to borrow other people\u2019s money. Warren Buffett was practicing the Infinite Banking Concept when he used his insurance float to bail out Bank of America during the Great Financial Crisis. He earned money on his loan and the investment at the same time.  There are many memes in financial services like there is no alternative to stocks, buy the dip, sell the rip, hold on for dear life, dividend growth investing, time in the market beats timing the market, or buy term life and invest the difference. The beauty of an Indexed Universal Life insurance policy is that you can do all of the above on steroids. Treat the premiums as a forced savings account in the same way that a mortgage is a forced savings account. To minimize the sequence of returns risk, employ the dollar-cost averaging method every month into 1-year, 2-year, or 5-year index options. You can be fully invested in the stock market while harvesting principal and interest payments on a monthly compounding basis for the rest of your life before reaching retirement age. You can think of an IUL as a decentralized options vault. At this point, it would be reasonable to ask yourself, \u201cHow can an insurance company give you most of the upside of investing in stocks while eliminating the downside?\u201d The short answer is that it\u2019s a multi-trillion dollar carry trade, the long answer is it\u2019s complicated.  Screen Shot 2022-06-09 at 5.41.58 AM1170\u00d7755 133 KB  The argument goes that you simply don\u2019t get anywhere near the market returns due to the cost of insurance, rider fees, the loss of dividends in the index, the cap rates, and the participation rates. The insurance company can achieve such results because they use the interest earned and profits from underwriting mortality and morbidity risk to purchase institutional index options at scale which carry embedded leverage that magnifies returns. For instance, you have $100,000 in CSV in a Pacific Life IUL and all of your money has been dollar-cost averaging for 60 consecutive months. Starting month 61 you start to receive the principal plus interest earned based on the returns of the far out-of-the-money call options initiated 5 years earlier. Starting Month 13, you are eligible to increase your returns by 2.7 times whatever the index returns using the Enhanced Performance Factor rider. The insurance company can afford this by using the interest that would have accrued over 5 years on $100,000 plus a 7.5% fee on CSV as an options budget and buying option collars that dynamically hedge the downside risk while leaving plenty of upside. For instance, the 7.5% generates $7,500 in options budget plus let\u2019s say 3% or $3,000/year of interest equals an options budget of $22,500 with longer duration risk you can achieve higher returns.

This means that you can swing for the fences every month using the uncapped S&P index option and still earn a 1.15% return every month in the event the stock market falls. Between March 2020-2021, the index rose 67% and the policy earned a 69% return after subtracting the spread of 7% and adding back the 15% multiplier. Companies like Nationwide use proprietary volatility-controlled indexes to keep the costs of hedging low and charge a 1% fee which helps increase the number of options they can purchase which they pass on to the insured in the form of a participation rate of 175-220%. Insurance companies have actuaries that price these things to perfection, so they would not guarantee 100% or more participation rate, loan provision, performance multipliers, and so on without being certain that they could meet those liabilities for a lifetime.

For instance, my Pacific Life IUL has $10,000 in CSV and $185,000 in death benefits. This means that I am purchasing 175 units of life insurance. If in Year 10 I have $120,000 in CSV and $200,000 in death benefit, then that means that I am paying for only 80 units of life insurance since that is the net amount at risk to the insurance company. Even though each unit is now more expensive than it was in Year 1, the increase in CSV offsets the rising cost of insurance over time. After 10 years, IULs charge around 20 basis points of CSV which is much cheaper than what you would pay a private wealth manager. It also comes with living benefits which allow you to withdraw money from the death benefit while you are still alive if you are diagnosed as chronically, critically, or terminally ill.

For DeFi to become mainstream, we need more ways to evaluate creditworthiness both on- and off-chain. Maker can bring to market an all-in-one loan that combines the best features of bundling insurance, investment, and credit. By tokenizing the collateral assignment of life insurance, Maker can onboard life insurance contracts as a Non-Fungible Token. This would give consumers an open, decentralized, and transparent database of in-force policy illustrations that they could use to determine which companies, agents, and index options are the cream of the crop. As things currently stand, it is very hard to access that kind of information since it is essentially a person\u2019s bank account. Also, the insurance companies hide almost all marketing data behind the veil of \u201cFor financial professional use only. Not for public solicitation.\u201d However, if you anonymize the data and only upload the redacted financials it proves to everyone beyond a shadow of a doubt that cash value life insurance is not a scam and can accumulate wealth far better than any other asset class. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to see a Dune dashboard showing your policy\u2019s performance since inception and future potential earnings?  PacLife Guarantees816\u00d7623 370 KB  Since policy owners already have gone through KYC/AML that means that after onboarding them as customers, you can give them a soul-bound token that proves their real-world identity on the blockchain. Making building an on-chain and off-chain reputation a seamless experience for customers. If you could access the line of credit with virtual and physical debit cards, the Maker all-in-one loan would go mainstream fast. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be a part of that cutting-edge financial innovation? At the very least it creates a permanent capital sink for DAI loans. If you impose a floor rate of 4% with a capped rate of 8% (since you are lending people their cash after all), you can confidently increase the DSR attracting more capital and creating a flywheel effect. The more life insurance contracts you onboard, the higher the DSR which increases the amount of staked DAI you can use to issue more loans generating more yield. This in turn increases DAI market share, minimizes smart contract risk, reduces earnings volatility, and brings mainstream adoption of a completely new kind of loan. The loan demand would come from customers like me looking to maximize their total return, but not able to do so due to a lack of liquidity during the first 25 months of starting an IUL. Most IULs either limit the IRR by forcing you into shorter duration options you can use to take out an indexed loan or capping returns at single digits like PennMutual. Another alternative is the fixed-rate loan which guarantees a flat rate for life, but you are not earning anything on the collateral securing the loan which means a guaranteed loss. Maker can provide massive value by bridging the funding gap between the first few years that you are ramping up the principal and dividend growth. For example, I have half my money in the 1 Year index and 5 Year index option with Pacific Life because they will allow an indexed loan to be based on the 1-year, not the 2-year or 5-year index options. So putting all my money in the highest return options means losing access to my liquidity unless I use the fixed-rate loan which is worse than the indexed loan. By providing this line of credit, you would supercharge the Internal Rate of Return of IULs and decrease the risk of default by generating larger future earnings.

Millennials trying to become financially independent and retire early. People already practicing the infinite banking concept with their whole-life insurance and IULs. Pre-retirees looking for guaranteed income or a means to get to full retirement. Those with money in investment retirement accounts. Those with money in stocks and bonds. Real estate investors looking to double-dip using cash value and the line of credit as proof of reserves. Small and medium-sized enterprises as a balance sheet asset or to use as a working capital line of credit. Anyone who likes the idea of a tax-free immediate Social Security check for life. Or anyone who likes the idea of a reverse mortgage line of credit, but does not have access to one.Business professionals and high net worth individuals looking to earn passive income. People trying to rebuild their personal or business credit after a bankruptcy. You could charge a separate fee for these services. In conclusion, the value proposition is onboarding degen yield-farming of variable triple-digit stablecoin APYs using decentralized option vaults with no liquidation self-repaying leverage while at the same time having your money participating in a no-loss lottery fixed APY liquidity pool. The winner gets a death benefit and everyone else earns passive income for life. The way it works is customers deposit their money into a TradFi proof of stake contract and this enables the yield-farm to swap your fiat for interest-bearing stablecoins. Those stablecoins are wrapped inside of a term life insurance policy which creates superfluid collateral that can be used to yield-farm and take out a self-repaying DeFi loan. In so doing, protecting lives and livelihoods.

Yes, the point is to lend people their own money because life insurance policies have a cash value which is essentially an interest-bearing stablecoin. So why not lend on an overcollateralized basis since banks are already doing this on whole life (95% LTV) insurance policies and IULs (75% LTV). In fact, Banks own $191 Billion in Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) as Tier 1 capital. The further point is that in so doing it would create an all-in-one solution to invest, spend, insure, and build credit at the exact same time since it overcollateralized and generates tax-free earnings for life. Basically, everyone who has a policy represents a stand-alone Asset Management Firm and their cash value is the AUM we want to attract since it\u2019s risk-free collateral.

The target premium on a $10,000 a year policy is $355. How much would it cost you to hire a wealth manager? Or get term life insurance. Or get a low-interest fixed-rate reverse mortgage? Did I mention that the payments on a life insurance loan are voluntary because they will simply subtract the outstanding balance from the death benefit which is about 3 times larger than your cash value? In other words, every contract has an interest rate swap built-in with the fixed-rate loan option and the indexed rate which is variable but can produce a positive yield spread. Basically, the insurance company is contractually the lender of last resort. Making MakerDAO the mezzanine debt investor since they always have someone they can refi the loan to. Also if you look at the policy charges the costs decrease to $160 in Year 11. $120 is administrative charges and only $40 is going to the term life insurance policy because the cash value is buying units of insurance which brings the net amount at risk to the insurance company down. Hence insurance getting cheaper and nearly free since earnings on your principal are way more than the few basis points your paying for them to manage your money for you.

Julius Baer    Why financing universal life policies makes perfect sense What is universal life insurance premium financing and why has it become such an attractive solution for wealthy clients?      There are all kinds of estate and tax matters also that can be considered in these types of arrangements. If you wanted to try this life insurance cash-value backed lending out, then perhaps worth thinking about doing an initial chunky deal with these types of players? Best there is a bit of size to make it worth the effort - because it will require some structuring. These guys are generally capital optimisers, so Maker might have a shot given a good funding rate. And cash values are generally very good credit for sure (given the right policies and structures). Just an idea for you. ",

                    "content": "Every permanent life insurance policy comes with contractual loan provisions that force the life insurance company to make loans available up to your cash surrender values. Whole life insurance policies have instant liquidity on day 1. This means you can pay $10k Monday and have $8k in your bank by Friday. Or you can use it as collateral for a bank line of credit from Coastal States Bank for 100% Loan To Value or Merchants and Manufacturers Bank (my current option) for 95% LTV. There are many banks and third-party lenders out there competing for this collateral. This is due to the no-risk collateral and high relative return. The collateral assignment of life insurance (last document in the post) acts as a lien on the cash value and death benefit of the policy such that the lender has first dibs on the money and after the lien is removed the remainder goes to the insured. Basically, a super-senior secured position with a built-in self-liquidation mechanism, and from the insured\u2019s perspective, it is just a refinance from one lender to another. And the insurance carrier does not require minimum payments ever since they will get paid at death. So, lending on an over-collateralized basis means the borrower and lender are safe the whole time.     This is why I think it is very doable since the only thing you have to do is tokenize the real-world document and upload the in-force illustration as part of the NFT to track historical performance. Since LoanSnap and Bacon Protocol are already originating mortgage-backed NFTs, I think insurance-backed NFTs are not really reinventing the wheel. This is due to the fact that mortgages and insurance contracts are not securities. Even though IULs and whole life insurance policies have equity-like returns indexed to the stock market, they are not securities. For instance, Guardian Life\u2019s guaranteed 4% return and 11% cap can generate far more than an AAA-rated bond and similar risk profile.  Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 7.32.33 AM786\u00d7758 109 KB  The way Maker can outcompete existing third-party lenders is by removing the cap on returns on cash value life insurance policies. By allowing 90% LTV on an Indexed Universal Life insurance policy, borrowers can go leveraged long the stock market looking for a moonshot in a safe manner. My current line of credit offers checkbook control which is OK but I would prefer a debit card linked to it like my Checking Line of Credit. So if we offer that, it makes it super accessible to everyone. Furthermore, it removes discrimination in lending based on race, gender, religion, etc. since the only thing we care about is cash value and the only thing you need for that is decent health. Many people use their children to take out an IUL policy to keep costs low and maximize earnings. For example, a 30-year-old male has a 1-year-old son and he gets a survivorship IUL on both himself and his son from PennMutual to cut insurance costs in half, compound for a lifetime, and transfer to his son tax-free. You can get a policy on a business partner, spouse, key man (eg. property manager), or someone who owes you a lot of money (eg. promissory note). Insurable interest has a lot of applications. It is Estate Planning made easy. By the way, I am not coming up with anything original here. The insurance industry is moving in the direction of an all-in-one solution to meeting customers\u2019 needs. I think we should be trying to front-run that disruption and get rewarded with massive publicity and grateful customer for life.    money.yahoo.com    Insurers look to offer one-price, all-in-one policies and retirement solutions In the last two years, customers could finally submit claims and interact with carriers through mobile apps.
