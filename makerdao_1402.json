Today was a Historic step in adding a Tokenized cash version coming from centralised entities (USDC) to enhance the liquidity collateral. We have been working on tokenizing Trade Finance Assets through TradeFinex. Trade Finance Assets are over 15 Trillion in value globally. They run the show for basic human consumption. Even as Coronavirus outbreak started, the first thing that people resort to are stacking up supplies from supermarkets. Trade Finance Assets are usually buyer guaranteed (supermarkets are a great example) or confirmed payables and yield 4-9% annually. They are usually exempt from securities act unless there is a securitization that converts them into notes or fixed income bond like instruments. I wanted to introduce TradeFinex to the MakerDAO community with the vision that some of the assets that are tokenized on TradeFinex can act as collaterals for DAI in the near future. We are working with several Trade Banks to standardise the tokenization and distribution method for these assets. Our team is working towards tokenizing about 100 Million of Trade Finance assets by Q2 and scaling it multiple X with Trade Banks (Origination Partners). I\u2019d love to connect with MakerDAO community in getting feedback on how we can effectively scale this and further enhance what MakerDAO has been doing and add healthy mainstream adoption. One thing that still sucks except US is fiat on ramps for cryptos are pretty expensive or time consuming. TradeFinex.org can change that. TradeFinex network of Trade Banks can provide effective fiat on ramps. An Article that explains:    Medium \u2013 4 Mar 20    Stablecoins & Legacy Finance: How can stablecoin-holders earn interest...

There\u2019s nothing unusual in traditional finance about securitizing things like mortgages, micro cap stocks, etc that are illiquid, and this will inevitably happen in blockchain finance as well if we are to be successful. I am a little concerned about having the primary protocol exist on a separate chain though(specifically the xdc chain), this adds an additional layer of complexity and intermediary/custodian risk on top of all the normal issues with custodial risks of physical assets, and the complexity of securitization. This swapping between xdc and erc20 would essentially need to be done trustlessly with a smart contract to be acceptable. Overall, I think this is probably the most complex token idea we\u2019ve seen proposed so far and I don\u2019t really see this type of product being a priority anytime soon. If it was built with the tinlake protocol instead, and operated through tinlake on Ethereum it would be easier to imagine some kind of onboarding roadmap. ",

The function of the XDC coin is not explained anywhere. The best case scenario is that this is a project still being developed and the Maker community will hear from them again when they have a functional product.

There are 2 reasons why XDC network as a layer for implementation of TradeFinex was chosen  a. It will go down to competitive fee structure for transaction and transaction finality b. Governance model is hybrid. Its decentralised but XDPOS (XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake) works on 2/3rd consensus. We are assuming when large scale real world assets are introduced on the network, the participants are going to demand Governance  The market maybe ready more than we think. Within MakerDAO community it may seem not so much a priority right now but the enterprises that we speak with are heavily inclined to start transactions ASAP.  Looking forward to more feedback from the community. ",
