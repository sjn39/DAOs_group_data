                    "content": "I\u2019m very interested in the idea of pure outsiders being able to have permissionless insight into the workings of not only the GitCoin DAO but any DAO. This \u2018permissionless insight\u2019 or \u2018radical transparency\u2019 (call it what you will) is actually possible for the first time now that we have smart contracts. To the extent that the money is spent through the token or some smart contract (such as a multi-sig), an outsider can see anything they want to look at. One of the things I\u2019m noticing, for example when I look at the Admin page of the SnapShot website: Snapshot is that many situations, people use an address that does not have an ENS name. A worse problem (at least with that page that I\u2019m looking at) is that the addresses of the smart contracts is not always so easy to find. I was thinking about the by-laws that are being discussed and wondering if there can be some provision in there that requires anyone with the ability to spend more than XXX tokens is required to have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d ENS name associated with the address in question. So \u201ctrueblocks\u201d instead of \u201cwildmolasses\u201d or some other meaningless word. I\u2019ve seen this type of provision in different partnership agreements or organizational papers I\u2019ve seen in real life. I mentioned \u201coutsiders\u201d above, but the idea I\u2019m proposing is to purposefully open the \u201cdoings\u201d of the DAO so wide that \u201coutsiders\u201d can more naturally feel like they are insiders because everyone has equal access to where the money is flowing (if they have the desire/tools/skills). Just an idea for discussion. Wondering what others think. ",

                    "content": "First of all, I\u2019m just thinking out loud and engendering conversation, so not really a proposal just yet. I come at DAOs (and smart contracts in general) from a different perspective than most people. I purposefully come at smart contracts \u201cfrom the outside\u201d. On-chain data, read directly from the node software, permits access to the \u2018internal workings\u2019 of an organization without permission. It\u2019s not possible for anyone inside the organization to keep outsiders from watching the smart contracts. That\u2019s not only a good thing. It\u2019s a very good thing. When I do this, in almost every case, the difficulty comes not from my ability to see into the internal working, but my ability to gather the addresses of which contracts to watch. (And by extension the addresses of those who have permission to spend the money \u2013 i.e., owners, signers, etc.) The idea is to make access to the list of \u2018addresses to watch\u2019 in a DAO (or any smart contract system) easier to find. ENS names make that process much easier. (Although I don\u2019t guess it should be a requirement\u2013maybe a \u2018social\u2019 requirement.) If an organization wants to be truly open-source and public, it should not only encourage but enable outsides to dig as deeply as they want without permission. We used to call this \u2018radical transparency\u2019 six years ago. ",

I also think that the line between outsiders and insiders blurs when the insiders practice radical transparency. Smart contracts give us a tool for doing this for the first time ever. We should lean in, not away. Having said that, I am also conflicted. Not only because are there issues with anons, but just the physical act of collecting these address is hard \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s an indication of why it\u2019s needed not a reason why not to.
