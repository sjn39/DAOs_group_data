If you are in one of these groups that consumes the ABI specification, please let me know so I can add you to this working group. We also aim to create a standard test suite for ABI encoding/decoding that all of these groups can use to supplement their testing suite (and eventually merge all core featureset tests!).

While I reserve my opinion on this particular point but respect this is a\u2026uthor's discretion at the technical choice made in this proposal.  That said, this different understanding about ERC20's `approval` whether they mean to be `payable` or `nonpayable` or _unspecified_ seem to hard to be represented in Solidity, and hence a good point to use ABI actually       ",
