                    "content": "Protocol Engineering has informed GovAlpha that due to illness within the team, they have been unable to complete the testing necessary to deploy today\u2019s planned Executive Vote safely. As a result, PECU has redeployed team resources, and the Executive is expected to be ready for deployment in the next 24-48 hours, hopefully resulting in minimal disruption. As a reminder, this week\u2019s Executive contains:  Multiple Collateral Auction Parameter Changes. Changes from the most recent MOMC recommendations  CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Stability Fee decrease. YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling decrease.   Recognized Delegate compensation for September.  Due to the multiple parameter changes planned for the spell, it is crucial that appropriate testing is done before deployment to protect the integrity of the liquidation system. Office hours are not on for this spell, so it will be able to execute over the weekend. GovAlpha and PE apologize for any inconvenience as a result of this. We will update this thread if further delays are encountered.  cc\u2019ing relevant stakeholders: @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @gov-comms-core-unit @Recognized-Delegates @Protocol-Engineering @Risk-Core-Unit ",
