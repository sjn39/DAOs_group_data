                    "content": "Out of schedule executive proposal In the light of recent events related to centralized stablecoins depegging as a result of underlying banks having liquidity issues, certain mechanism improvements of the Maker Protocol may be prudent. One such mechanism improvement is to implement an emergency capability to disable PSM (PSM-USDC-A, PSM-PAX-A and PSM-GUSD-A) debt ceilings (DCs) to zero (0) without the GSM delay. The capability to limit exposure in a much faster manner compared to GSM delay, will allow the DAO to manage crises related to instability of the banking system faster, which significantly reduces our potential exposure to centralized stablecoin which are used as a proxy to hard peg the price of DAI to USD. The following proposed changes are a product of discussion and collaboration between multiple core units involved in the monitoring of the financial and technical developments over the weekend following the USDC depeg. Proposed parameters and changes; Introduce a PSM Breaker, a new exception to GSM delay by implementing a new MOM contract, which will instantly disable additional borrowing from PSMs by reducing the DC to zero once an executive vote has passed. The worst case scenario where this addition would be misused is that DAI could potentially trade with a premium until governance would organize and reverse the change (subject to GSM delay). List of current exceptions to the GSM delay can be found here. Risk CU would prefer to recommend that this proposal goes to executive vote as soon as possible, as an out of schedule executive vote, which will be right after the current passed exec vote has been executed.

That being said, can you walk us through why it needs to be rushed through today rather than wait until a regular executive? The PSMs service only stablecoins whose cash reserves are held at US banks, which appear to be getting the full backing of the US government. Given these parameters would affect the majority of the value backing DAI, we want to make sure this doesn\u2019t introduce risky edge cases. Having a few days to think about it would make us more comfortable, but perhaps Risk and PE have already gamed out the possible scenarios? ",

Other, less severe measures should be considered with more time and greater clarity of mind once the dust settles.
