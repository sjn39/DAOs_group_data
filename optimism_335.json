Builders Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? (If so, please link to committee): Yes, Builders - https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Builders-Sub-Committee-02ba9da5b4534fbf955e6e4c8fcf1aa3 Project description (please explain how your project works): Our project is an integration of Optimism, Velodrome and Tarot in Edge, a self custody platform, where key management and DeFi are simplified. Our platform can provide a frictionless UI/UX for users to utilize Optimism, Velodrome, and LP staking on Tarot, in a secure, and simplified platform. We can replace the many steps and difficulties that are in most DeFi apps/websites, and provide access to the Optimism ecosystem in a familiar way, and comparable to what users are used to with TradFi and CeFi, but in a private and secure way. To accomplish this, Edge can perform all the necessary steps on the backend for functionalities such as LP staking, instead of the user. No waiting times for users, or switching products, just a simple demand, and Edge takes care of the rest.

Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  One Million+ Users in Edge app, 3+ million accounts on SDK 60k-160k MAU (Monthly active users) in Edge app  Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link):  Exodus Wallet - \u200b\u200bhttps://www.exodus.com  Coinomi Wallet - https://www.coinomi.com  Breadwallet - https://brd.com/   Crypto.com Wallet - https://crypto.com   Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, already open sourced since 2014 Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Q4 2022 / Q1 2023 Ecosystem Value Proposition:   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?  Cryptocurrency is difficult for many people to navigate, and it can hinder the potential success of projects and blockchains, especially in self-custody solutions. The UX is generally full of friction points requiring multiple applications and steps, to complete many functionalities. Switching applications, multiple waiting times in between transactions, and general unfamiliarity creates too many negative points in a single process, prompting users to give up, or switch to a risky custodial platform where comfortability masks the dangers of institutional dependency.    How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?  All the friction points in the process of self sovereign opportunities are necessary, but can be hidden in a hard working, private, and secure application. In Edge, users will be able to directly purchase Optimism with one of our integrated exchange partners, Utilize Velodrom to swap with any of Velodrome\u2019s supported assets, and stake LP tokens on Tarot. All of these massively productive actions for Optimism\u2019s ecosystem will be done in a sleek UI, and minimal step process that feels familiar to users, because Edge is taking care of all the steps and processes behind the scenes. Users will actually be able to easily skip the multiple apps and waiting times, and finish their transaction, while Edge completes all the steps for them. Our solution provides users with the frictionless curtain that people are used to with centralized solutions, while maintaining their privacy and custody on a secure and simplified platform.    Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?  Edge would also provide growth of users that are not already technical or that would normally dive into DeFi due to the complexity with the current wallets and platforms out there. Edge with buy/sell/swap functionality would also increase the potential volume of Optimism and also allow for more liquidity with the ability for users to easily stake assets either on Velodrome or Tarot. Users would also gain access to all the tokens available on Optimism that is support for swaps or staking on Velodrome and Tarot    Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback. No, Edge has never applied for an OP grant. Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Edge does not have a token so we cannot immediately match. However, we will provide ongoing maintenance and support. Edge is the only self-custody, open source, privacy-focused wallet that has had phone support where you can talk with a human being since 2014. We will continue to provide this high level of support once Optimism is supported along with Velodrome Swap/Staking and Tarot Staking. Any new changes or upgrades done on those will be supported by Edge to make sure new features and updates are implemented to give the best user experience. Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)  As outlined in the eligibility criteria for the Builders grant, Edge is committed in holding OP for a period of 1 year. After a period of 1 year or after unlocked, Edge hopes to cover costs associated in the areas below in completing this project:  Engineering - 65% QA/Support - 25% Marketing - 10%  Note, if after 1 year held and OP is higher than it is today, Edge plans to utilize the excess amounts after covering costs to continue to build on Optimism. We would be happy to report back here and would likely allocate resources for additional marketing or new features or dApps on Optimism to integrate.   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.  Milestone 1: Week 3-4: Mainnet Optimism along with tokens supported. Able to send/receive and store OP and tokens on Edge + swap into using CeFi swap exchange partners Milestone 2: Week 4-6: Velodrome Swap functionality Milestone 3: Week 6-9: Velodrome and Tarot LP Staking functionality    Benchmark Milestones Updated  Benchmark Milestone 1 - A downloadable APK version of Edge with the functionality of Optimism and tokens supported with the ability to store, send, receive, and swap with existing swap partners but may have bugs - March 15, 2023 Benchmark Milestone 2 - A downloadable APK version of Edge with the functionality of Velodrome swaps but may have bugs - April 15, 2023 Benchmark Milestone 3 - A downloadable APK version of Edge with the functionality of LP Staking on Optimism in Edge but may have bugs - May 15, 2023    New Milestones Format Updated - Critical Milestones  Critical Milestone 1 - Edge will deploy main net Optimism with tokens supported with full functionality where users will be able to store, send, receive, and swap with existing swap partners on Edge on or before March 31st, 2023 or end of Q1. This functionality will be live on the Playstore and AppStore. Critical Milestone 2 -  Edge will deploy Velodrome built inside Edge with full functionality of Velodrome Swap functionality where users can swap Optimism and tokens into other assets on Optimism on or before June 30th, 2023 or end of Q2. This functionality will be live on the Playstore and AppStore. Critical Milestone 3 - Edge will deploy LP Staking functionality for both Velodrome and Tarot where users will be able to stake a pair of assets and earn from them on or before June 30th, 2023 or end of Q2. This functionality will be live on the Playstore and AppStore.    Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.  We currently do not have the ability to track volume on DEXs in Edge. We could incorporate that into Milestone 2 with enough funding.    Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?  Users and liquidity will continue to remain even after incentives dry up as users will have a use case to continue to use the swap functionality to exchange into other assets and also to continue to earn by providing liquidity through staking.

This proposal would primarily maximize the number of users interacting with applications on Optimism by:  Exposure to 3 million + accounts already on Edge with MAU ranging from 60k-160k on a wallet that is open-source, non-custodial, has never been hacked since inception in 2014, and one of the few wallets that also provides human phone support. Maximize non-technical user adoption - As you may already know, navigating in DeFi using Metamask or other wallets may be extremely challenging for the average user to be able to connect to the right chain and/or even enter the correct RPC or chain ID information. Edge makes it easy such that users would be able to interact with dApps to do swaps or staking for example with a few taps such that even someone non technical would be able to participate when they normally would not have been able to or would have given up.  This proposal would also increase the number of developers building on Optimism as Edge is open source. Developers outside may wish to build on top of Edge building on Optimism. Edge also has white labels that if these features are implemented would also be supported with those white labels and their engineering teams may also continue to build on top of Optimism. Let me know if you have any questions! Thank you. ",

As we\u2019re getting closer to the final review, I wanted to bring your awareness of a new Milestone Assessment the Grant council proposed. It is not mandatory for cycle 10 to stick to this format, but it shows what are we looking for when assessing Milestones, so you might want to adjust your Milestones to maybe get a better score on the final review. If you\u2019d like to discuss anything related to that, don\u2019t hesitate to ask here or contact me directly (I\u2019m a Builders sub-committee reviewer). Again thank you for the effort you guys are putting into this proposal! ",
