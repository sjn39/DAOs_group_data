We\u2019re the first and the largest lending protocol of Optimism for a long time, the total supply market size reached $10M. Thanks to Optimism Collective for giving us this opportunity to share the governance fund.  Our Goals WePiggy core development team hopes to use the funds carefully to achieve the following goals.   Participate in the construction and governance of Optimism ecosystem for a long time;   Reward early supporters of WePiggy (Optimism Branch) ;   Attract more liquidity to the Optimism ecosystem and maintain it for a long time.    $OP Token Distribution Plan  Early Supporters: 60,000 $OP (20%) Airdrop to users who deposited their funds in WePiggy (Optimism Branch) in the early stage, in return for the liquidity they provided to the Optimism ecosystem for a long time;  Early-stage: From November 15, 2021 (WePiggy launched on Optimism mainnet) to Apr 27, 2022 (OP token announcement)  Distribution plan: The rewards will be distributed in proportion to the liquidity provided by the user.  Future Long-term Deposit Users: 240,000 $OP (80%) The largest portion of the funds will be used to incentivize long-term deposit users and attract more long-term sustainable liquidity to the Optimism ecosystem, especially stablecoins. We will launch a [Term Deposit] feature on Optimism, and distribute this part of $OP incentive to long-term deposit users according to the deposit time and deposit amount. This approach has been repeatedly proven to be effective and attractive in the Terra and Near ecosystems, avoiding short-term funds without loyalty and bringing in more users with a long-term investment mindset. Once these users enter and become familiar with the Optimism ecosystem, they will become loyal users to the ecosystem and will not leave easily after the incentives dry up.  Duration: Long-term deposit rewards would be distributed on a 3-month, 6-month basis.  Co-Incentives To be fair, we aim to match the token rewards value of $WPC and $OP on a 1:1 basis. Note: $WPC incentive distribution plan needs to be approved by the WePiggy DAO. The specific distribution plan has not yet been finalized.  More possibilities   After $OP has sufficient trading liquidity, we will launch the $OP lending market and allocate more $WPC incentives, which can also increase the use cases of $OP.   If more $OP token incentives can be allocated to us in the future, we can launch a dual-mining event to attract more funds into Optimism.   WePiggy V2, a safer and more efficient lending protocol we are working on, will be the first to launch on Optimism mainnet.   ",

Providing incentive on the basis of long term deposit is also an excellent idea, only challenge i see here is the math behind this logic.

How are you planning to encourage retail to use your platform?     Victor:  The WePiggy team will publicize the multisig address and invite the Optimism team members to participate in multi-signature management (if the Optimism team is willing to participate).   This is excellent move, multi-sig address managed by governance. This is how you built confidence in a project. ",

The specific plan will be sent to the community for a formal proposal. Based on current reward levels and Optimism\u2019s liquidity-building needs, we should focus on encouraging long-term deposits. The reward for long-term deposits is definitely linked to the amount and term. In addition, it is only for the stablecoin markets, not for other assets. We believe this is the most efficient way to improve Optimism TVL. As long as there are long-term deposits, the borrowing of retail investors will also be active, which will bring more assets. With limited incentives, we cannot choose to benefit all groups, which will make the incentives unattractive to anyone. Of course, we also proposed in \u201cMore Possibilities\u201d that if we can get greater support from Optimism, we can take into account the Retail group. ",

Victor:  linked to the amount and term   I am not in favor of rewarding \u201cwhales\u201d, goal should be encouraging small retail user. Sadly, I dont have any better suggestion. have you thought of giving incentives to new user bridging to OP and using your platform? Also, for these deposits and long term hold, is there any penalty for Sybil users ??     Victor:  With limited incentives, we cannot choose to benefit all groups, which will make the incentives unattractive to anyone.   This is true, but do you think its possible to divide them in group, amount + duration of deposit and give incentive according to that, this range you decide with your team and community but the idea would be up to 1K with 6 month would get more reward compare to users in range from $1K-10 and so on. and of course, proposal to penalize Sybil users. If proven, reward goes to user finding the Sybil user and i would go one step ahead and say that, penalize the Sybil user\u2019s deposit by few percent. ",

Long-term deposit incentives must be more attractive than flexible deposits, but should not be excessive, so as not to exhaust the OP incentive prematurely; 2/ We don\u2019t know the exact launch time of $OP (maybe you know more than we do); 3/ We don\u2019t think we should spend too much time distinguishing user types For a lending protocol, it is simple and clear enough to judge the user\u2019s contribution by the deposit term and deposit amount. Even if a whale address is willing to deposit a large number of funds in the protocol for a long time, his contribution is huge (providing stable liquidity for other users who have borrowing demands). For retail users, if their amount of funds is not large enough, they can choose a longer deposit term to get more returns, showing their trust and expectation in Optimism and WePiggy. We agree that the Optimism team hopes to avoid Sybil users who want to get the $OP airdrop as much as possible. But for lending protocols, our understanding of contributions and the distribution of incentives are different. 4/ We originally planned to set different amounts of token incentives according to different deposit amounts and terms. But we don\u2019t tend to set complicated rules. Whale users can bypass all restrictions simply by creating multiple addresses. As a result, this only led to unnecessary risks and increased gas costs. 5/ We do not encourage users to report each other, which will tear the community apart and hurt our brand value. We believe that it is enough to initiate proposals, provide transparent, objective, and fair rules, and then users can be rewarded according to their contributions. Whether you agree or not, our team thinks so. 6/ With limited rewards, we cannot accomplish all motivational goals. We believe this is another goal of rewarding new users for entering the Optimism ecosystem. For example, we can initiate a new proposal, suggesting that Optimism provide some $OP, cooperate with Web3 Educaiton projects such as Rabbithole and ProjectGalaxy, and attract new users to use high-quality applications on Optimsim. Of course, in order to avoid Sybil users as much as possible, BrightID binding can be required. We can facilitate this cooperation as much as possible. ",

With limited rewards, we cannot accomplish all motivational goals. We believe this is another goal of rewarding new users for entering the Optimism ecosystem. For example, we can initiate a new proposal, suggesting that Optimism provide some $OP, cooperate with Web3 Educaiton projects such as Rabbithole or ProjectGalaxy, and attract new users to use high-quality applications on Optimsim. Of course, in order to avoid Sybil users as much as possible, BrightID binding can be required. We can facilitate this cooperation as much as possible.  ",

We\u2019re the first and the largest lending protocol of Optimism for a long time, the total supply market size reached $10M. Thanks to Optimism Collective for giving us this opportunity to share the governance fund. Our Goals WePiggy core development team hopes to use the funds carefully to achieve the following goals.  Participate in the construction and governance of Optimism ecosystem for a long time; Reward early supporters of WePiggy (Optimism Branch) ; Attract more liquidity to the Optimism ecosystem and maintain it for a long time.  $OP Token Distribution Plan Early Supporters: 30,000 $OP (10%) Airdrop to users who deposited their funds in WePiggy (Optimism Branch) in the early stage, in return for the liquidity they provided to the Optimism ecosystem for a long time; WePiggy Core Development Team: 60,000 $OP (20%) Allocated to the WePiggy core development team, the team will use this part of the funds to participate in Optimism\u2019s ecological construction and governance voting for a long time as a BUIDELer. The WePiggy team will publicize the multisig address and invite the Optimism team members to participate in multi-signature management (if the Optimism team is willing to participate). Future Long-term Deposit Users: 210,000 $OP (70%) The largest portion of the funds will be used to incentivize long-term deposit users and attract more long-term sustainable liquidity to the Optimism ecosystem, especially stablecoins. We will launch a [ Term Deposit ] feature on Optimism, and distribute this part of $OP incentive to long-term deposit users according to the deposit time and deposit amount. This approach has been repeatedly proven to be effective and attractive in the Terra and Near ecosystems, avoiding short-term funds without loyalty and bringing in more users with a long-term investment mindset. Once these users enter and become familiar with the Optimism ecosystem, they will become loyal users to the ecosystem and will not leave easily after the incentives dry up. Duration: Long-term deposit rewards would be distributed on a 3-month, 6-month basis. Co-Incentives To be fair, we aim to match $WPC to $OP on a 1:1 basis. Note: $WPC incentive distribution plan needs to be approved by the WePiggy DAO. The specific distribution plan has not yet been finalized. More possibilities  After $OP has sufficient trading liquidity, we will launch the $OP lending market and allocate more $WPC incentives, which can also increase the use cases of $OP. If more $OP token incentives can be allocated to us in the future, we can launch a dual-mining event to attract more funds into Optimism. WePiggy V2, a safer and more efficient lending protocol we are working on, will be the first to launch on Optimism mainnet.    weppy is an excellent project.and is doing well.so thats a good idea for this proposal ",
