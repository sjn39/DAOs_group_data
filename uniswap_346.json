Topics that were exactly regarding the airdrop / snapshot / etc. However, as it\u2019s a \u2018hot\u2019 topic, we\u2019ve allowed a few topics to remain open that cover the overall discussion. Personally I agree, the snapshot has happened - those eligible can claim their UNI. Let\u2019s move on to actual governance. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll move there soon enough and there\u2019ll be clear guidelines for what this forum should and should not be used for. Edit; that being said I\u2019m sure I can close this topic  ",
