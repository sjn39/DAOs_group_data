Paragraph Summary The TechOps Core Unit handles system administration and technical support needs of Maker Protocol and its Core Units. TECH-001 strives to improve communication and collaboration between the developers, end users, and other MakerDAO stakeholders by applying DevOps principles to software delivery and first-class technical support. For the past year, TECH-001 has been delivering infrastructure and support in an automated, safe, fast, and repeatable way with the help from some of the modern Infrastructure Administration tools, while continuously monitoring and improving our process throughout.  Specification  Motivation First and foremost we are here to continue supporting critical MakerDAO infrastructure. In line with that the TechOps Core Unit proposes the following budget cap to financially support in delivering on our mandate outlined in MIP39c2-SP29. After successfully operating for one year within the DAO and receiving feedback from the Community and the Delegates on our previously proposed and rejected budget, we are able to lower our new budget even further while continuing to bring value to the DAO. Additionally, to acknowledge the community\u2019s sentiment to cut costs and TechOps CU eventually transitioning into an Ecosystem Actor role, we\u2019re also introducing two new budget options:   NewBase (67% of existing budget)  NewBear (55% of existing budget)  More in the Budget Details section below.  Core Unit ID TECH-001  Budget Implementation  We have been following the above budget implementation since the beginning of our Core Unit, which has been working quite well to keep our finances transparent. It follows the standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit and will involve a setup with an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet which will be topped up on a monthly basis with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce as much as possible the overhead for Maker governance. The TECH-001 budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit. Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical or financial problems. Providing the protocol control over funds held in the Auditor Wallet and Operational Wallet. Reducing governance overhead to a minimum. Providing full transparency and be kept in check by a group of trusted auditors.  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  Streaming the annual budget for TECH-001 using DssVest for one year. A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism.   Multisig Wallets The following multisigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multisig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role-based multisigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have two roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants.  The Accountant Role Multisig will have 2 signers, both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multisig will also have two signers, also both SES permanent team contributors. SES will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multi-sig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup. This multisig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2013 One wallet for TECH-001 operational expenses. This is a 2-out-of-2 multi-sig controlled by TECH-001. Signers include both facilitators of TECH-001.  The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will also be listed as a beneficiary on the Operational Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Operational Multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup.  Monthly Budget Statement Within the first five days of each month, TECH-001 will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast - A forecast of the Dai amount required to maintain a 3-month operational runway for the team based on the latest available information.  MKR Vesting Overview - A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transactions  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallet that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet    The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in this GitHub repository. The monthly budget statements from the previous year of operations can be found in this GitHub repository. We are also successfully onboarded to the SES Transparency Dashboard and constantly looking to improve our processes to make our financial reporting more transparent.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission: Within the first five days of the month, TECH-001 submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.  Transaction Requests Submission: In parallel, TECH-001 submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallet balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds: TECH-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull: The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the TECH-001 DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.  Auditors\u2019 Review: The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by TECH-001 to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings.  A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the TECH-001\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals: Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallet.  Auditor Wallet Returns: The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the Surplus Buffer.  As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.  Auditor Wallet Configuration The following configuration of the TECH-001 Auditor Wallet is implemented:  Accountant Role Wallet (0xA2A855Ac8D2a92e8A5a437690875261535c8320C) as a signer Auditor Role Wallet (0xB2da57e224949acDDe173a5b8A8160c023ea86e6) as a signer  MCD_PAUSE_PROXY as a beneficiary, with an allowance of 1B DAI withdrawal Configure required confirmations as 2-out-of-2   Transactions DssVest Stream A total maximum of 1,666,722 DAI (NewBase) or 1,368,924 DAI (NewBear) will be streamed to 0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B starting 2023-04-01 and ending 2024-03-31.  Budget Breakdown The yearly budget cap request for the TechOps Core Unit is 1,666,722 DAI (NewBase) or 1,368,924 DAI (NewBear). This equates to a monthly budget cap of 138,894 DAI (NewBase) or 114,077 DAI (NewBear) to support the team\u2019s mandate. This budget cap secures a team of 5.7 full-time employees (FTE) (NewBase) or 4.7 FTE (NewBear), critical infrastructure and tools, as well as covering all other operational costs listed in the table below. At the end of the calendar year, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker Protocol. Should the TechOps Core Unit shut down, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately (read more in \u201cUnwinding and Defunding\u201d section).     Category Existing NewBase (1 year) NewBear (1 year)     Compensation and Benefits $1,090,000 $1,032,220 $845,370   Cloud Infrastructure $684,000 $400,000 $400,000   Tools $54,000 $40,000 $40,000   Gas $0 $30,000 $30,000   Professional Services* $100,000 $67,000 $40,000   Travel and Accommodation $63,000 $63,000 $0   Conferences and Education $18,000 $18,000 $0   R&D $24,000 $0 $0   Hardware $20,000 $0 $0   Integrations $50,000 $0 $0   VulcanizeDB $205,000 $0 $0   Recruiting $60,000 $0 $0   Contingency $105,150 $16,502 $13,554   TOTAL $2,473,150 $1,666,722 $1,368,924   Difference - 67% 55%    *Audits, Accounting and Legal - to support the new naming scheme used in the reports on the Maker Dashboard  Budget Details We present two budget options to the community as specified by MIP40 structure.   NewBase (67% of existing budget)  No new hires in this budget term. Major Cloud Infrastructure optimizations (more below). Additionally with transitioning to Endgame we expect this to go down even further as we hand over to other teams. Forecast tightening for essentials services like Tools and Professional Services. Remove a few existing expense categories from our budget now that we have a clearer picture of our operations and as a means of cost cutting. Scale down contingency for Compensation and Overall to 1%.    NewBear (55% of existing budget)  All of the cuts from NewBase. Relocating 1 FTE to other projects. Removing non essential Professional Services such as Legal and Audits. No Travel and Conferences for the team.     Compensation and Benefits The total people cost includes Compensation and Other people costs such as benefits, including any taxes and fees relating to compensating people for their work. As a contingency, this has been scaled up by just 1% to help with any unknown costs involved in dealing with multiple jurisdictions worldwide. Now that we\u2019re fairly established, we\u2019re able to bring this figure down from the previous 5%. The essential factor of TechOps services is 24/7/365 support. This requires proper coverage across all time zones. The Core Unit team already has a total time zone coverage with Engineers in the Americas (2 Engineers), Europe (3) and APAC (2). Another important factor of TechOps services is cost effectiveness. Combining these two factors together, the team also provides non-critical Maker protocol services to other Core Units and commercial entities (subject of separate arrangements), and settles the accounts based on FTE (full-time equivalent) allocation.  Infrastructure & Tools The second biggest cost after people is the Cloud Infrastructure we host and provision. In the previous 2022 budget cycle, TechOps Core Unit\u2019s focus was on infrastructure optimisation. After operating successfully for one year, we are able to significantly lower the cap that was requested previously by $503,000 from initially budgeted $943,000 to $440,000 (annualized current cost).  Note: TECH-001 has to make the final call on whether there are enough resources and budget to host any new infrastructure. Critical Maker infrastructure is our number one priority and the budget has been made to reflect that.   VulcanizeDB This is a database project that caches Ethereum blockchain data for easy and fast querying. The project was initiated in the Maker Foundation and now legacy infrastructure that some of the Maker components depend on, such as:  Emergency Shutdown Vaults listing. Liquidations monitoring. Services such as <api.makerdao.com> and <mkranalytics.com>. Forum badges.  We are currently considering a number of options to replace this service due to minimal development and additional infrastructure cost. The new budget has absorbed this cost into the Cloud Infrastructure category due to the TechOps team undertaking the maintenance without outsourcing. This resulted in entirely eliminating the cost of $205,000 initially budgeted for the VulcanizeDB maintenance and development.  TechOps R&D/POC This item relates to both Infrastructure costs and Training costs involved in R&D and Proof of Concept (POC) development; we are highlighting it here separately for transparency. We\u2019ve found we can significantly lower this budget cap due to engineers ability to automate the provisioning and destruction of these development environments. Therefore, we are able to test faster without the need to have this development infrastructure constantly on and costing money.  Third-party Integrations We work with a number of projects such as Forta (developed by OpenZeppelin) to help integrate Maker Protocol into their tools to further support the protocol\u2019s daily operational tasks, such as running keepers. Such integrations require support from those projects which will be invoiced to and covered by TECH-001. All the solutions will be open source and made available to the MakerDAO community. This hasn\u2019t been a focus area for us, so we are able to remove this line item.  Professional Services Audits Much like in the Smart Contract Development world, audits are an indispensable resource in the Infrastructure Engineering field also. Due to the increasing number of moving components, complexity increases, making it crucial to have as many professional eyes looking over the systems as possible, ensuring there aren\u2019t any weak areas that can be exploited. Of course, our team does this constantly, but additionally we\u2019ll be looking to seek advice from a professional third party. Accounting Outsourcing the accounting work related to TECH-001, including operational support and annual reporting. Legal consultancy Covering legal opinion consultation, including contract drafting, writing up Terms & Conditions, and questions related to liabilities and insurance.  Recruiting Fees There will be no new recruiting in 2023. We are able to significantly lower this cost in the new year after successfully establishing our operations.  Travel and Accommodation A crucial travel budget line item in order to fund attending conferences and team offsites which are critical for remote teams to build interpersonal relationships and vital for collaboration and retention.  Conferences and Education In our fast-moving industry, it becomes absolutely paramount to keep up to date with new technologies and various implementations done by others. Conferences are a fantastic way to meet like-minded engineers in the space, and also an opportunity to present our own work to an audience. Education can either be face to face or an online course in a subject that an engineer finds relevant to MakerDAO infrastructure.  Hardware Initially, our assumption based on previous experience was that we may need to conduct various tests locally that can\u2019t be deployed to our Cloud infrastructure. Local testing hasn\u2019t been needed, therefore we are able to remove this line item.  Contingency Acknowledging the community\u2019s scrutiny of a general-purpose 10% buffer, this contingency represents just 1% of the total budget cap and is there to act as a safety buffer against any unknown or unexpected costs. As we\u2019re more established now than when starting out earlier in the year we don\u2019t expect this to be exercised.  Budget Term This renewed budget for TECH-001 will begin on April 1st 2023 and end 12 months after (as per the MIP40c3 standard) on March 31st 2024.  Increasing Value to Maker Tokenholders Most of the value we deliver to the protocol is outlined in MIP39c2-SP29: Adding TechOps Core Unit MIP. Additionally and taking the recent developments and prioritization by governance into the account:  Support Maker Protocol and cooperate with the other Core Units implementing the Engame\u2019s Pre Game and beyond  More in the Roadmap section.   Support Maker Protocol and cooperate with the other Core Units around expansion to L2  Additional critical infrastructure complexity. DUX Gasless voting support. Oracle CU expansion to L2s deployment and monitoring. Starknet CU L2 expansion support. Protocol Engineering CU L2 (Optimism and Arbitrum) expansion support. GovAlpha CU ongoing governance monitoring. General technical support to other CUs.   Ongoing Protocol Security, Operations and Monitoring  Supporting Protocol\u2019s critical functions such as:  Keepers. Monitoring. Oracles. Nodes. Legacy infrastructure. Governance processes.   As the protocol grows security becomes more and more important. Which is why we\u2019re working with the community to always follow security best practices. Enhanced monitoring and automation of new and existing services utilizing the latest tools. Infrastructure security audits and mitigation of any findings.   Roadmap and Objectives  Transition TechOps CU to an Ecosystem Actor and/or Infrastructure Tribunal.  As we\u2019re naturally offering our services to multiple CUs already (and already have the traditional service contracts established with some), it\u2019ll be quite organic for us to transition to an EA.   Define initial Infrastructure Scope Framework. Support other CUs transition to Endgame and smoothly hand off any services currently hosted by TechOps themselves to the new Ecosystem Actors if needed. Assist in setup, hosting, monitoring or upgrading any of:  MetaDAO(s) Frontends/Apps. Unified MetaDAO/Endgame Forum. Clusters Forum(s)/Discord Servers.   Any other Endgame related infrastructure movements. Further Decentralization and increased availability of infrastructure:  Research & Implementation. Increased Kubernetes usage and implementation.   VulcanizeDB alternatives:  We\u2019ve started on research and implementation of The Graph Protocol.   Optimizing and automating the delivery of support to MakerDAO by using chat bots, showing work in progress etc.:  We\u2019ve significantly improved our support request receival and tracking. Would like to further improve the Discord bot usability and work in progress transparency.   Improving internal and external knowledge sharing and increasing community engagement.  The nature of our services makes it difficult to put a roadmap in stone, as the work we do is very dependent on the work of other Core Units; however, the above should give the reader an idea of the areas for our focus.  Team Summary The current team will be composed of nine contributors at 5.7 FTE (NewBase) or 4.7 FTE (NewBear) total. We are hoping to retain the current team without any new hires in the new year. The structure below presents a team structure built around the mission of providing technical support services to MakerDAO Ecosystem.  Facilitator/DevOps Engineer x2 at 1.6 FTE. DevOps Engineer x5 at 3.4 FTE (NewBase) or x4 at 2.4 FTE (NewBear). Project Manager at 0.5 FTE. Operations Consultant at 0.2 FTE.  Note: NewBear option relocates 1 DevOps Engineer FTE from the DAO to other projects.  Contingency Planning TechOps Core Unit could guarantee minimally viable business continuity if the approved Budget Proposal was operating during a Bear/Superbear context: 10%/20% lower. The following measures can come into effect:  No new hires in the new year.  Consequences and risks: no improvements to infrastructure decentralization and timezone coverage (bear).   Aggressive Cloud Infrastructure costs optimizations. Halting of the existing non-critical Cloud Infrastructure to save costs. Fewer off-sites and conferences.   Unwinding and Defunding In the case of the ratified proposal for the offboarding of the TechOps Core Unit, a process of handover, unwinding and closing down activities will follow. It will need to include the following activities: 1. Finishing current initiatives All activities that have already started at the point where the Core Unit proposal is rejected, have to be finished. That includes:  Informing other Core Units on the planned TechOps Core Unit closure activities. Finishing all open activities, project and collaboration initiatives that were started with other Core Units. Making sure all the tasks in open, blocked, code review or testing statuses are completed. Merge all opened pull requests. See if open branches require to be merged/discontinued.  2. Transferring ownership of tools and services used by the Community that is currently run by TechOps Core Unit There is a set of tools and services (currently 36) that are used by both the Community and the TechOps Core Unit team to do the work that would need to be transferred to another Core Unit or an entity or a person. All these tools need to continue running with no interruptions. Transfer would consist of changing tools ownership, updating company details, updating billing details, as well as performing small training of how and where each tool is used. 3. Transfer of infrastructure and the code for setting it up and running There is a big part of infrastructure (servers, cloud providers, services) that is currently maintained by TechOps Core Unit. As a part of unwinding the Core Unit, it will be necessary to transfer the ownership to another Core Unit or an entity or a person. Transfer would require giving access (forking) the code that is used for 4. Transferring of all the monitoring and alerting setup Monitoring, tools used for monitoring and alerting, keepers, etc. have to be transferred to another Core Unit, entity or person. Since monitoring and alerting is a critical part of keeping the Maker Ecosystem secure, extensive training has to be performed. 5. Returning of any unused funds Once all the activities have been performed, unused funds will be returned from TechOps operational wallet back to the protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB). Taking into account the complexity of monitoring and infrastructure and necessity of handover, it is expected that the unwinding process for TechOps Core Unit might take up to six months or more. TechOps Core Unit contributor MKR vesting will be accelerated to the nearest 6-month vest on completion of the wind-down. This means a contributor vesting 10 MKR annually would vest 5 MKR at completion of the wind-down. The above clause overrides the 12-month cliff.  Proposal Parameters This MIP40c3 subproposal provides the following budget options:  A: Approve NewBase budget B: Approve NewBear budget C: Reject budget D: Abstain  ",

I\u2019m a bit confused why, if the budget is 1,666,722 DAI, you want to give your CU the ability to draw up to 1,666,722 + 694,470 DAI. This was done last time as well and doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me but maybe I\u2019m missing something. The way I see it, if the budget is 1,666,722 DAI and you start with an initial seed transfer of 694,470 DAI, the stream should allow you to draw a maximum of 1,666,722 - 694,470 or 972,252 DAI. ",

Paragraph Summary The TechOps Core Unit handles system administration and technical support needs of Maker Protocol and its Core Units. TECH-001 strives to improve communication and collaboration between the developers, end users, and other MakerDAO stakeholders by applying DevOps principles to software delivery and first-class technical support. For the past year TECH-001 has been delivering infrastructure and support in an automated, safe, fast and repeatable way with the help from some of the modern Infrastructure Administration tools, while continuously monitoring and improving our process throughout.  Specification  Motivation To continue supporting critical MakerDAO infrastructure, the TechOps Core Unit proposes the following budget cap to financially support in delivering on our mandate outlined in the MIP39c2-SP28 Adding TECH-001. After successfully operating for one year with the DAO we were able to lower our current budget, and instead add two potential new hires to be able to bring even more value to the DAO. In the previous 2022 budget cycle, TechOps Core Unit\u2019s focus was on infrastructure optimisation. The Core Unit\u2019s efforts resulted in reducing the infrastructure costs by $503,000 from initially budgeted $943,000 to $440,000 (annualized current cost). In the next year TechOps Core Unit will focus on improving infrastructure decentralization (including Support of the Endgame Plan, pending the Vote decision) and increased time zone coverage (more in the Roadmap section). These improvements require two new hires (more in the People Cost section). Regardless of the plan to hire two new engineers, the overall budget for 2023 will be lower than the budget for 2022 thanks to the savings described above.  Core Unit ID TECH-001  Budget Implementation  We have been following the above budget implementation since the beginning of our Core Unit which has been working quite well to keep our finances transparent. It follows the standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit and will involve a setup with an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet which will be topped up on a monthly basis with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce the overhead for Maker governance as much as possible. The TECH-001 budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit. Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems. Provide the protocol control over funds held in the Auditor Wallet and Operational Wallet. Reduce governance overhead to a minimum. Provide full transparency and be kept in check by a group of trusted auditors.  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  Streaming the annual budget for TECH-001 using DssVest for 1 year. A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism.   Multisig Wallets The following multisigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multisig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role-based multisigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have two roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants.  The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have 2 signers\u2014both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multi-sig will also have 2 signers, also both SES permanent team contributors. SES will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup. This multisig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2013 One wallet for TECH-001 operational expenses. This is a 2-out-of-2 multi-sig controlled by TECH-001. Signers include both facilitators of TECH-001.  The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will also be listed as a beneficiary on the Operational Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Operational Multisig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup.  Monthly Budget Statement Within the first five days of each month, TECH-001 will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast - A forecast of the Dai amount required to maintain a 3-month operational runway for the team based on the latest available information.  MKR Vesting Overview - A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transactions  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallet that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet    The Monthly Budget Statements from the previous year of operations can be found in this GitHub repository. We are also successfully onboarded to the SES Transparency Dashboard and constantly looking to improve our processes to make our financial reporting more transparent.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first five days of the month, TECH-001 submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.  Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, TECH-001 submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallet balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 TECH-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull - The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the TECH-001 DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.  Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by TECH-001 to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings.  A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the TECH-001\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals \u2013 Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallet.  Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer.  As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.  Auditor Wallet Configuration The following configuration of the TECH-001 Auditor Wallet is implemented:   Accountant Role Wallet (0xA2A855Ac8D2a92e8A5a437690875261535c8320C) as a signer   Auditor Role Wallet (0xB2da57e224949acDDe173a5b8A8160c023ea86e6) as a signer   MCD_PAUSE_PROXY as a beneficiary, with an allowance of 1B DAI withdrawal   Configure required confirmations as 2-out-of-2    Transactions  Initial Seed Transfer  749,685 DAI will be transferred to Auditor multisig wallet (0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B) on 2023-2-1. This seeds the Operational Wallet to 3x the Monthly Budget Cap. This also initially funds the Auditor Wallet to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The initial transfer funds the Operational Wallet, enabling the Core Unit to begin operations. This also then positions DssVest to begin streaming funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap each month in the Auditor Wallet.  DssVest Stream  A total of 2,398,988 DAI will be streamed to 0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B starting 2023-2-1 and ending 2024-1-31. (2,398,988 DAI is calculated as Quarterly Budget Cap x 4 = 599,747 DAI x 4).  Budget Breakdown The yearly budget cap request for the TechOps Core Unit is 2,398,988 DAI. This equates to a monthly budget cap of 199,916 DAI to support the team\u2019s mandate. This budget cap secures a team of 7.9 full-time employees (FTE), critical infrastructure and tools, as well as covers all other operational costs listed in the table below. At the end of the calendar year, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker Protocol. Should the TechOps Core Unit shut down, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately (read more in \u201cUnwinding and Defunding\u201d section).

As a contingency, this has been scaled up by 5% to help with any unknown costs involved in dealing with multiple jurisdictions worldwide. The essential factor of TechOps services is 24/7/365 support. This requires proper coverage across all time zones. The Core Unit team already has a total time zone coverage with Engineers in the Americas (two Engineers), Europe (three) and APAC (two). We plan to hire another two Engineers in the near future to improve time zone coverage, namely in the Americas (+1) and APAC (+1). The target Core Unit\u2019s time zone coverage with Engineers: in the Americas (three Engineers), Europe (three) and APAC (three). Another important factor of TechOps services is cost effectiveness. Combining these two factors together (the 24/7/365 support and cost effectiveness), the team also provides services to other Core Units and commercial entities (subject of separate arrangements), and settle the accounts based on FTE (full-time equivalent) allocation.  Infrastructure & Tools The second biggest cost after people is the Cloud Infrastructure we host and provision. After operating successfully for one year we are able to significantly lower the cap that was requested previously by $503,000 from initially budgeted $943,000 to $440,000 (annualized current cost).  Note: TECH-001 has to make the final call on whether there are enough resources and budget to host any new infrastructure. Critical Maker infrastructure is our number one priority and the budget has been made to reflect that.   VulcanizeDB This is a database project that caches Ethereum blockchain data for easy and fast querying. The project was initiated in the Maker Foundation and now legacy infrastructure that some of the Maker components depend on, such as:  Emergency Shutdown Vaults listing. Liquidations monitoring. Services such as api.makerdao.com and mkranalytics.com. Forum badges.  We are currently considering a number of options to replace this service due to minimal development and additional infrastructure cost. The new budget has absorbed this cost into the Cloud Infrastructure category due to the TechOps team undertaking the maintenance without outsourcing. This resulted in entirely eliminating the cost of $205,000 initially budgeted for the VulcanizeDB maintenance and development.  TechOps R&D/POC This item relates to both Infrastructure costs and Training costs involved in R&D and Proof of Concept (POC) development and we are highlighting it here separately for transparency. We\u2019ve found we can significantly lower this budget cap due to engineers ability to automate the provisioning and destruction of these development environments. Therefore, we are able to test faster without the need to have this development infrastructure constantly on and costing money.  Third-party Integrations We work with a number of projects such as Forta (developed by OpenZeppelin) to help integrate Maker Protocol into their tools to further support the protocol\u2019s daily operational tasks, such as running Keepers. Such integrations require support from those projects which will be invoiced to and covered by TECH-001. All the solutions will be open source and made available to the MakerDAO community. This hasn\u2019t been a focus area for us, so we are able to remove this line item.  Audits Much like in the Smart Contract Development world, audits are an indispensable resource in the Infrastructure Engineering field also. Due to the increasing number of moving components, complexity increases, making it crucial to have as many professional eyes looking over the systems as possible, ensuring there aren\u2019t any weak areas that can be exploited. Of course, our team does this constantly, but additionally we\u2019ll be looking to seek advice from a professional third party.  Accounting Outsourcing the accounting work related to TECH-001, including operational support and annual reporting.  Recruiting Fees We are planning to grow the team by two Engineers in 2023. Recruiting fees are known to be rather high in the industry due to the high demand for quality talent. TECH-001 will keep the bar high for only the best new team members; therefore, recruiters are going to be critical in finding that talent.  Legal consultancy Covering legal opinion consultation, including contract drafting, writing up Terms & Conditions, and questions related to liabilities and insurance. We are able to significantly lower this cost in the new year after successfully establishing our operations.  Travel A substantial travel budget in order to fund attending conferences and team offsites which are critical for remote teams to build interpersonal relationships and vital for collaboration and retention.  Conferences and Education In our fast-moving industry, it becomes absolutely paramount to keep up to date with new technologies and various implementations done by others. Conferences are a fantastic way to meet like-minded engineers in the space, and also an opportunity to present our own work to an audience. Education can either be face to face or an online course in a subject that an engineer finds relevant to MakerDAO infrastructure.  Hardware Initially, our assumption based on previous experience was that we may need to conduct various tests locally that can\u2019t be deployed to our Cloud infrastructure. Local testing hasn\u2019t been needed, therefore we are able to remove this line item.  Contingency The contingency represents 5% of the total budget cap and is there to act as a safety buffer against any unknown or unexpected costs.  Budget Term This renewed budget for TECH-001 will begin on February 1st 2023 and end 12 months after (as per the MIP40c3 standard) on January 31st 2024.  Increasing Value to Maker Tokenholders Most of the value we deliver to the protocol is outlined in our Adding TechOps Core Unit MIP. Additionally and taking the recent developments and prioritization by governance into the account:  Support Maker Protocol and cooperate with the other Core Units around expansion to L2   Additional critical infrastructure complexity   DUX Gasless voting support.   Oracle CU expansion to L2s deployment and monitoring.   StarkNet Core Unit L2 expansion support.   Protocol Engineering Core Unit L2 (Optimism and Arbitrum) expansion support   GovAlpha Core Unit ongoing Governance monitoring.   General technical support to other CUs.    Increased Effort into Infrastructure Decentralization  In a continuing effort to remove all the single points of failure this is a large but important chunk of work that would require thorough investigation, implementation and additional team members   Ongoing Protocol Security and Monitoring  As the protocol grows, security becomes more and more important \u2014 which is why we\u2019re working with the community to always follow security best practices Enhanced monitoring and automation of new and existing services utilizing the latest tools. Yearly external party infrastructure security audits and mitigation of any findings.   Roadmap and Objectives  Further Decentralization of infrastructure.  Research & Implementation. Multi cloud approaches. Increased Kubernetes usage and further implementation.   VulcanizeDB alternatives.  We\u2019ve started on research and implementation of The Graph Protocol.   Optimizing and automating the delivery of support to MakerDAO by using chat bots, showing work in progress etc.  We\u2019ve significantly improved our support request receival and tracking. Would like to further improve the Discord bot usability and work in progress transparency.   Chaos Engineering implementation for testing the redundancy of components. Improving internal and external knowledge sharing and community engagement.  The nature of our Services makes it difficult to put a roadmap in stone as the work we do is very dependent on the work of other Core Units; however, the above should give the reader an idea of the areas for our focus.  Team Summary The current team is composed of nine contributors at 5.7 FTE total. We are hoping to add two more engineers at 0.8 FTE and relocate 0.6 FTE from the existing team towards the DAO. With these changes the total team will be 11 contributors at 7.9 FTE total. The structure below presents a prospective team structure built around the mission of providing technical support services to MakerDAO Ecosystem.     Role People FTE     Facilitator/DevOps Engineer 2 1.6   DevOps Engineer 7 5.6   Project Manager 1 0.5   Operations Consultant 1 0.2   Total 11 7.9     Contingency Planning TechOps Core Unit could guarantee minimally viable business continuity if the approved Budget Proposal was operating during a Bear/Superbear context: 10%/20% lower. The following measures can come into effect:  No new hires in the new year - consequences and risks: no improvements to infrastructure decentralization and time zone coverage (superbear) One new hire - consequences: no improvements to infrastructure decentralization (bear) Aggressive Cloud Infrastructure costs optimizations Halting of the existing non-critical Cloud Infrastructure to save costs Less off-sites and conferences   Unwinding and Defunding In the case of the ratified proposal for the offboarding of the TechOps Core Unit, a process of handover, unwinding and closing down activities will follow. It will need to include the following activities:  Finishing current initiatives  All activities that have already started at the point where the Core Unit proposal is rejected, have to be finished. That includes:  Informing other Core Units on the planned TechOps Core Unit closure activities. Finishing all open activities, project and collaboration initiatives that were started with other Core Units. Making sure all the tasks in open, blocked, code review or testing statuses are completed. Merge all opened Pull Requests. See if open branches require to be merged/discontinued.   Transferring ownership of tools and services used by the Community that is currently run by TechOps Core Unit  There is a set of tools and services (currently 36) that are used by both the Community and the TechOps Core Unit team to do the work that would need to be transferred to another core unit or an entity or a person. All these tools need to continue running with no interruptions. Transfer would consist of changing tools ownership, updating company details, updating billing details, as well as performing small training of how and where each tool is used.  Transfer of infrastructure and the code for setting it up and running  There is a big part of infrastructure (servers, cloud providers, services) that is currently maintained by TechOps Core Unit. As a part of unwinding the Core Unit, it will be necessary to transfer the ownership to another Core Unit or an entity or a person. Transfer would require giving access (forking) the code that is used for  Transferring of all the monitoring and alerting setup  Monitoring, tools used for monitoring and alerting, keepers, etc. have to be transferred to another Core Unit, entity or person. Since monitoring and alerting is a critical part of keeping the Maker Ecosystem secure, extensive training has to be performed.  Returning of any unused funds  Once all the activities have been performed, unused funds will be returned from TechOps operational wallet back to the protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB). Taking into account the complexity of monitoring and infrastructure and necessity of handover, it is expected that the unwinding process for TechOps Core Unit might take up to six months. TechOps Core Unit contributor MKR vesting will be accelerated to the nearest 6-month vest on completion of the wind-down. This means a contributor vesting 10 MKR annually would vest 5 MKR at completion of the wind-down. The above clause overrides the 12-month cliff.

Voters will be forced to choose between a relatively frivolous budget and allowing an essential core unit to operate without budget for some time. Hopefully, this leads to a broader solution where the DAO won\u2019t face this conundrum anymore. A broader solution is far more important than correcting one instance. In good faith, would you be willing to allow an on chain vote in the subsequent cycle to determine whether to expand personell and spend an extra $500k or not?     simonkp:  We\u2019d like to keep adding value to the protocol and not just passively support it.   Your core unit has added plenty of value with its current personell. It\u2019s not the time to scale up, and a decision like this should be left to the DAO. It\u2019s not right to make it all or nothing. But like I said, I would rather focus on a solution that would block any facilitator from proposing all-or-nothing budgets than focusing on this single instance. I just hope you make it right and somehow allow the DAO to decide. ",

It\u2019s understandable if you only have one or two periods of experience in the budget. But it is not saving it is spending less than predicted. The savings will be: This year we fell short of our expectations and only spent $400,000 versus $900,000. To create savings for the DAO, we will reduce our actual spending from $400K to $300K. That is a saving. When you spend $400,000 one year and then plan to spend $400,000 the next year, there is no saving. It looks like what you\u2019ve done is spend less than your budget and then compensate by increasing spending elsewhere, possibly salaries. If your vote is approved, will you offer DAO voters the opportunity to decide whether to raise the team with an additional $500,000 in spending? I only have a few MKRs myself but I know I\u2019ll vote not to spend what doesn\u2019t have to be spent. I have a few other ideas but if I understand correctly the voting has already started, so you can\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t mean to fight. But you\u2019re framing this as a budget cut where if you spent more this year than last year\u2019s actual values, you would be spending more not less. So it\u2019s not a fair way to describe it as a reduced budget. ",

Due to some great effort from the team in the past year spent on optimising our second biggest cost - infrastructure (after salaries), we are able to add 2 more engineering resources to help deliver even more value and further future infrastructure optimisations for the DAO. More value for the smaller price sounds like a saving to me. The flip side of that is continuing on without any optimisations, burning the cash because we don\u2019t have enough resources to implement said optimisations. ",

The flip side of that is continuing on without any optimisations, burning the cash because we don\u2019t have enough resources to implement said optimisations.   You make a decision on behalf of the owners, which is probably okay if they agree to your total original budget. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not a savings if the extra value isn\u2019t planned for. In this case, you take the decision again but with two steps: one is to ask the owners for the budget and the other is to ask to spend more. It would be nice if the owners had the choice on whether or not to invest further, rather than deferring to you again. Simply: How much did you actually spend last year, and how much do you budget for this year? If the latter is a larger number, then there is more spending, not savings. There are only two options: use cash or return cash. Not that means bad versus good. If you return a lot of cash, it is reasonable to ask what went wrong also. You explain very well and clearly why your suggestion of how to use the cash is better than the alternative of giving it back, and I don\u2019t take issue with that. But it is not saving. ",
