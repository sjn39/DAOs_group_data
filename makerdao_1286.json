                    "content": "MIP#: <# to be assigned> Title: BFF Partnership with GnosisDAO Author(s): Karpatkey Tags: template Type: general Status:  Date Proposed: 2022-06-22  Simple Summary The proposal detailed below has already been approved by the GnosisDAO, we\u2019d just need MakerDAO\u2019s approval as well to make it happen! GnosisDAO and MakerDAO are naturally aligned with DAI as a common denominator. Gnosis Chain uses bridged DAI as its gas token so DAI\u2019s adoption is critical for the success of the network. Gnosis Ltd has already started buying MKR aggressively in the open market so it makes sense to align efforts with the GnosisDAO. Therefore, we propose the following:  Propose a token swap GNO-MKR of around $70 million to the Maker community Explore the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault with the GnosisDAO treasury using GNO + stETH and mint 100 million DAI to be used for the development of the Gnosis Chain Explore a GNO grant with MakerDAO growth core unit to expand global adoption and brand awareness of Gnosis Chain Rebranding xDAI to DAI Increase GNO incentives to DAI pairs on Gnosis Chain Periodically buy MKR in the open market using GnosisDAO\u2019s treasury farming rewards   Abstract GnosisDAO and MakerDAO both share a vision of using DAI to build a decentralized digital global economy that is fair, transparent and efficient. MakerDAO is one of the most prominent founding players in the DeFi ecosystem, broadly regarded as a blue chip DAO, and creator of DAI: one of the most solid stablecoins in the market, which has had an unwavering performance throughout all market crises so far. GnosisDAO\u2019s vision and ethos are aligned with MakerDAO\u2019s, and there\u2019s an opportunity of joining forces to improve both DAO\u2019s growth and impact in the ecosystem. All the suggested actions detailed in the Specification section of this proposal aim to strengthen cooperation between both organizations so that their efforts yield better results.  Motivation If MakerDAO joins forces with GnosisDAO to carry out DeFi promotional efforts, including social media communication, technical articles authoring, brand awareness, etc, there would be a synergical advancement of those efforts\u2019 impact, resulting in a significant increase in user adoption and positioning improvement, benefiting the DeFi ecosystem in general and both DAOs in particular.  Specification We propose carrying out the following actions:  Carry Out a Token Swap We would propose in both Gnosis\u2019 and MakerDAO\u2019s forums the execution of a large token swap of around $70MM, including incentives to maximize user adoption, approached as follows: The token swap between Maker (MKR) and Gnosis (GNO) would be used to create a liquidity pool in several Liquidity Protocols on Mainnet and Gnosis Chain. MKR/GNO pools will reward liquidity providers with GNO. Both DAOs would commit to a vesting period of 2 years. Token swaps have several benefits:  Treasury diversification Economic incentives to strengthen the bonds between both organizations and foster collaboration Increase the number of DeFi applications (staking, liquidity provision, etc.) for both DAOs, using the received tokens without selling them Increased liquidity of the tokens in different protocols.   Institutional MakerDAO Vault We\u2019d explore the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault funded by the GnosisDAO treasury using GNO + stETH and mint 100M DAI to be used for the development of the Gnosis Chain. This could potentially result in a lower and more stability fee, critical for the long term planning of the Gnosis Chain funding requirements.  Provide a GNO Grant for the Global Adoption of DAI MakerDAO Growth has been doing an exceptional job in achieving massive adoption of DAI in South America, having positioned it as the stablecoin of choice among DeFi users in the region. In order to further expand DAI adoption on Gnosis Chain (which also results in overall DeFi users increase) in the entire Latin American region, we suggest exploring a grant for MakerDAO growth. Parallel to Latam\u2019s coverage, a global expansion would be planned and executed, as detailed in the \u2018Join forces with MakerDAO to Expand Global DeFi User Adoption and Brand Awareness\u2019 point below, to foster adoption and brand awareness of the Gnosis Chain.  Rebranding xDAI to DAI xDAI, Gnosis Chain\u2019s native token, would be rebranded to DAI. This will result in an increase of awareness of DAI among GC users and it will also reduce perceived friction of bridging DAI to Gnosis Chain.  Increase GNO incentives to DAI pairs on Gnosis Chain DAI pairs will be incentivized in the Gnosis Chain with additional GNO, rewarding their liquidity providers with different combinations of GNO to increase the DAI TVL in the network.  Periodic MKR Acquisition The MKR token would be periodically acquired by the treasury execution team aiming to hold it long term, and increase MKR\u2019s liquidity in different DeFi instruments across different protocols and networks. Funds to acquire MKR would be taken from GnosisDAO\u2019s treasury farming rewards.  Join forces with MakerDAO to Expand Global DeFi User Adoption and Brand Awareness This cooperation efforts will be distributed to the most efficient actors in improving brand awareness of both DAOs, expand the DeFi user base and increase DAI\u2019s TVL across networks.  Social Media Publications will be made by official MakerDAO and GnosisDAO accounts to improve positioning of both DAOs, their products and tokens.  Multi-channel Advertising Collaboration efforts with cryptocurrency exchanges will allow them to increase the impact and reach of their multi-channel advertising campaigns, that aim to increase DeFi user base, DAI adoption and brand awareness of Gnosis and MakerDAO.  Co-branding and Article Publishing Technical articles about both DAO\u2019s products and solutions would be co-authored and published online, showing both their logos.  Real-life and Online Events, Presentations and Interviews Members of both DAOs will join efforts to participate in conventions, podcasts, interviews, presentations, etc. to raise awareness about their solutions (individual and collaborative), mentioning both DAOs and displaying both logos when applicable (for joint projects).  Rationale The main reason behind all joint efforts is to leverage the synergy that both DAOs could achieve, taking into consideration that both organizations have several common goals such as DeFi user base expansion, DAI adoption and technical improvements, evolution of the ecosystem and an increase in DeFi user friendliness to catalyze massive migration from TradFi to DeFi. MakerDAO has been considered given their trajectory in the ecosystem, the quality of their products, their evolution, brand awareness and the alignment of their vision with Gnosis\u2019. ",

It\u2019s neat that Gnosis Chain uses DAI for gas, but is that enough of a difference to ensure wide adoption? Is there a long-term theoretical advantage that Gnosis Chain has over Ethereum mainnet?

Gnosis Chain will have the most secure bridge to Ethereum. This is GIP-57.   Efficiency frontier of EVM chains: Gnosis Chain will be using the most advanced EVM clients allowing to increase the gas limit beyond what Ethereum does today without sacrificing decentralization. Other side chains are highly centralized compared to GC.   Client diversity: Gnosis Chain will have at least 2 implementations with dedicated teams (nethermind and erigon) for the execution layer and 2 for the consensus layer. Most side chains only rely on geth.   Account abstraction: Gnosis Chain clients will integrate account abstraction natively allowing much more sophisticated user interactions: seedless onboarding, automation and recovery of user accounts will be possible. This can be a game changer for retail adoption. So far no side chain has account abstraction but zksync and starkware are experimenting with it.   ",

I see a token swap this way:  It makes the treasury more resilient against a potential MKR bear market, if we consider uncorrelated assets. Right now GNO is heavily backed by ETH as most of Gnosisdao\u2019s treasury is ETH. It gives the treasury influence and aligns incentives with friend protocols. More stakeholders defending MKR\u2019s interests More types of tokens mean more opportunities for farming. LPs, loans, which could translate to potentially larger MKR buybacks. It reduces the concentration of MKR holdings within the Makerdao and it improves MKR\u2019s distribution, a long standing issue of MKR. Divestiture aversion: In behavioural economics, it is considered communities are more willing to value and retain a token if they already have it. Once treasuries own MKR, they will become part of Makerdao and treasuries are natural long term partners.  ",

I just looked into GIP-57 and I clearly see some good oppertunities the DAOs should talk about. Competitors like Compound and AAVE are not sleeping, they are working on their own chain (Compound Chain), RWA implementations and stablecoins (CASH, GHO). We can expect that our D3Ms revenues are going to shrink at some point. MakerDAO should always look for new opportunities and partners in this space. The GnosisDAO has a highly skilled team and Gnosis Chain commited itself to the Dai, this could be a huge opportunity. Btw. paying fees in a stable asset is a huge advantage and MakerDAO could bring this advantage a bit closer to the Ethereum ecosystem\u2026 always remember, if MakerDAO isn\u2019t doing this first, Compound will.

I\u2019d see this as  Treasury Swap IV a. stETH only b. GNO + stETH Co-branding alliance  Of course, we cannot encourage or prevent GnosisDAO from acquiring MKR on the open market. If you do, would be great to see you engaged in governance.     Karpatkey:  Institutional MakerDAO Vault We\u2019d explore the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault funded by the GnosisDAO treasury using GNO + stETH and mint 100M DAI to be used for the development of the Gnosis Chain. This could potentially result in a lower and more stability fee, critical for the long term planning of the Gnosis Chain funding requirements.   On vaults - stETH is available already and I encourage you to get in touch with @Growth-Core-Unit to discuss IVs. Only thought is for a GNO vault, would be great to hear about your openness to some sort of minimum backstop and ensure a base level of utilization of the vault. ",

However, if you wanted, you could make each proposal conditional on the other proposals being accepted if you want them to be linked. So, for example, a token swap proposal will only progress to completion if the institutional vault is approved and vice versa. Or you can leave them all separate, up to you. Re: the token swap, it would be useful to gauge the source of the MKR tokens you envision. Are they coming from the protocol treasury? Being bought on the market using the surplus buffer? Being bought over time using DssKiln? Being minted? The community will likely have different opinions depending on which method of obtaining the MKR tokens is proposed. ",
