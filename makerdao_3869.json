                    "content": " Solar X: Preliminary Risk Assessment The Real World Finance Core Unit (the \u201cCore Unit\u201d) recommends that the MakerDao review and provide preliminary feedback (for or against) on the terms and conditions for the proposed Solar X construction financing of a 10 MW solar farm in Suffolk County, New York. The Core Unit has separately made a proposal to MakerDao for its consideration of the Cayman Islands FoundationCo and Delaware LLC entities for Real World Asset financings. It is envisioned that FoundationCo and the Delaware LLC will be used for the Solar X financing. For purposes of this Preliminary Risk Assessment, the lending entity (Delaware LLC) shall be referred to as \u201cLendCo\u201d. The Core Unit will proceed to finalize the documentation for the Solar X financing if there is support for the terms and conditions set forth in this Preliminary Risk Assessment. The Core Unit will still submit a complete Risk Assessment and subject the Solar X financing to the standard governance process. Project Loan Terms As a construction loan for a 10 MW solar farm, the financing terms are more similar to a project finance loan, in that, the borrower (\u201cProject Co\u201d) will receive loan proceeds during the construction process and the loan will be secured by Project Co\u2019s assets. Solar X anticipates a 9 month project schedule. Project Co will undertake various preparatory activities during months 0 to 3. Physical construction will commence in month 4 upon the issuance of the notice to proceed to the EPC contractor (AECOM). Project Co will only sign it\u2019s long-term offtake agreement with PSEG Long Island (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE: PEG) BBB/Baa1) in month 4. Solar X anticipates commencement of commercial operation at the end of month 9. Draw and Disbursement Schedule Solar X proposes the following draw and disbursement schedule.   Draw on the Loan Agreement at its execution and fund $21,000,000 into escrow. The escrow agent to be determined. This amount will accrue interest upon deposit into the escrow account. The $21,000,000 includes a budgeted 12 months of principal and interest (\u201cDebt Service Funds\u201d) that will be used to pay principal and interest on a monthly basis during the construction period.   Escrow will release funds in accordance with the following schedule (subject to other conditions precedent to be negotiated with Solar X):   Month 0 - $3,285,000 to finance a portion of (1) Month 0-3 pre-development expenses (see aggregate breakdown below) and (2) acquisition of the site for the Solar X project ($3,000,000 acquisition cost). LendCo will have security over existing Project Co assets, which will principally consist of the site (value of $3,000,000).   Month 4 - 50% of remaining funds in escrow (excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds) upon execution of the Power Purchase Agreement and issuance of the Notice to Proceed to the EPC contractor.   About Month 6/7 - 25% of remaining funds in escrow excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds) for outstanding construction costs.   Project Completion - 25% of the remaining funds in escrow (excluding the remaining Debt Service Funds).   If Maker cannot accept funding Month 0-3 (as proposed), Solar X will suggest a lower interest rate (currently 5.80% \u2192 SFOR + 550 basis points).

Assuming their financial statements are correct and up to date, Xinyuan Real Estate looks like it is heading for a default if they can\u2019t keep rolling their $800+ million in USD debt. They also owe significant RMB debt through the Singapore and Shanghai markets. Would that expose SolarX loans (the collateral) to being liquidated if the AO experienced a negative shock \u2014 in particular if any equity is held by the AO? Also, would that affect operations of SolarX either before or after construction is complete? I like the general idea here, but the AO has an enormous debt burden and overhang from underperforming projects it hasn\u2019t been able to exit from yet.

                    "content": "@omahalawyer and @paperimperium Thank you for the questions on the Solar X preliminary risk assessment. For the preliminary risk assessment, my intention was to assess MakerDao\u2019s appetite for a construction loan and the proposed disbursement schedule \u2013 specifically lending to a project during the pre-feasibility study phase and then its construction phase. I did not anticipate each of these helpful questions for the preliminary risk assessment, so my apologies for its incompleteness.  We will more fully respond to each of your questions in the more comprehensive risk assessment (Comprehensive Risk Assessment), where we will describe the transaction timing, ownership structure, overall project budget, project schedule, project risks and mitigants and counterparty risk in greater detail. However, to provide further context for the Solar X transaction: The borrower (Project Co) will be owned directly or indirectly by third party tax investors and Solar X. As noted in an earlier response, we will discuss with Solar X their expected equity percentage in Project Co. For reference, the debt-to-equity ratio will be 75:25. We do not expect either Solar X or Project Co to be a Xinyuan Real Estate (Xinyuan) or UPRETS corporate entity. Typically, we will legally confirm this separation via (1) representations and warranties in the loan agreement, and (2) viewing of Project Co and Solar X\u2019s cap table. If our assumption is incorrect, we will review whether there may be any acceptable mitigants to Xinyuan\u2019s credit risk. We will clarify this point in the Comprehensive Risk Assessment. We had inquired as to whether UPRETS could (or would) make a loan to Solar X or Project Co in connection with the property acquisition. The answer we received was \u201cNo\u201d because of UPRETS higher cost of capital. It is for this reason Solar X sought initial financing from MakerDao to acquire the underlying land and fund pre-feasibility costs (Months 0-3). As we structure the actual transaction documents, we will assess whether or not there will be any impact from Xinyuan\u2019s debt situation. One way to address the risk is to fully keep the loan (as an asset) off UPRETS books. We will discuss this further with UPRETS, Solar X and external counsel. We will address more completely in the Comprehensive Risk Assessment. In terms of the overall financing, we envision that, as the sole lender to ProjectCo, MakerDao (indirectly through Delaware LLC and FoundationCo) will have a first priority security interest over all of Project Co\u2019s assets (including its shares). The exact form of security interest will depend on the underlying asset. But at a minimum, there will be a mortgage over the underlying land and related fixtures. We would also envision a security interest over contract rights. External counsel will undertake appropriate lien searches to ensure that the property is unencumbered, and that Project Co and Solar X do not have any existing liens over any other assets. To the extent that due diligence discloses any existing liens, such liens will have to be removed prior to any funding. The loan agreement will include appropriate representations, warranties and covenants in respect of liens. The fair market value of the secured assets will increase over time as the solar farm is developed. At a minimum, the land will have a fair market value equal to its acquisition price ($3,000,000). Solar panels, equipment, etc. will also have an independent fair market value. Solar X anticipates that, typical with other solar projects as evidenced in third party studies, the completed Solar farm will have a value of $32 million as of the commercial start date. For a third-party valuation model, see EPC Phase: Market Valuation Model - Regression analysis of 279 solar farm transactions (globally) by Deloitte. https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/dk/Documents/pardot-downloads/Deloitte_Valuing_Solar_PV_Farm_Assets_Global_Mar2018.pdf For this proposed transaction, Solar X does not propose to utilize the REIT structure set forth in its original MIP6 application. In terms of background, Solar X management includes: Andy Strott - Founder/Managing Partner: Andy has 25 years\u2019 experience in finance, including as senior executive with top-tier investment managers, Blackrock, Alliance Bernstein and MFS Investment Management. He has worked on the European continent, with responsibility to lead new initiatives.

With more than 30 years of engineering experience, his areas of practice include: Plan & Cost Review, Construction Estimates, Construction Schedule Review, Scope of Work Development and Review, Construction Monitoring, Construction Budget Assessment, Construction Requisition Review and Project Equity Rebalance. He is a graduate of Manhattan College. Finally, UPRETS\u2019 role, to date, has been more to facilitate the transaction. It has, for instance, engaged external legal counsel to prepare the underlying loan agreements and been responsible for the day-to-day schedule management. So far, I have been satisfied with external legal counsel. Claymore K. Hardman | GilmoreBell External legal counsel is preparing the documents from a lender perspective, and they continue to interact with me in that process. Please let me know if there are any further questions. ",
