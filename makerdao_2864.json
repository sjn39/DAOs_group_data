I consider it a collateral onboarding call since it has to do with the Fellowship that the Maker Foundation and Kleros have announced recently. Today it is my pleasure to have Federico from Kleros, co-founder and CEO. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

What\u2019s their incentive to do that? 19:57 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: You mentioned the name of PNK. Where does the name \u201cKleros\u201d come from?  21:29 - In one of those slides you showed the possibility of disputing maybe travel or crowdfunding. How do you dispute a travel or some crowdfunding that I participated in? 25:01 - As an American, the last thing I want to do is do jury duty. How do get over that hurdle to incentivize people to participate in a trial? 26:21 - Could you cover a little bit more in detail the listing part of your registering there and how that process actually works? 32:08 - My question was also oriented towards some comparison of other frameworks operating in this space. The Cryptocurrency Rating Council rates cryptocurrencies in terms of their propensity to be like a security or not. Have you done any benchmark of how this works or how this is better or improves existing frameworks for assessment of digital assets to be listed on exchanges? 36:25 - Juan Escallon: I have a question regarding how judges vote. They are incentivized to vote like the majority. That works a bit differently than traditional court. So, judges don\u2019t vote based on their convictions but based on what they think the other think. Am I understanding this correctly? 38:01 - Juan Escallon: But how do you avoid group think? It could happen that the collective misses something or thinks wrongly or unjustly 40:11 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the badges, the way it was phrased originally it looked like it was more like an Oracle. You mentioned a stablecoin. Would that be an Oracle providing that? Is it purely code or is it the same system where there\u2019s jurors? If it is the same system, how stable is a stablecoin? How much margin do you guys accept and is that in the rules or something? 41:56 - DeFiFrog: Do you imagine Maker using a system like Kleros to approve collateral types? 42:45 - DeFiFrog: Does the Kleros solution the capability to easily apply its decision-making process to other protocols? Would you be able to pull a random set of jurors from the Maker community to gauge their responses rather than PNK holders? Because I\u2019d imagine the incentives are aligned more for Maker community members to decide on collateral types rather than Kleros community members 45:04 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: When there\u2019s a deposit and it\u2019s challenged, does the reward go to the person who challenged or to the jurors? Or is it split? 46:18 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I want to know what\u2019s your most popular project? What\u2019s the best use case that you have right now? 47:03 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I guess we can move on to the fellowship 53:02 - Amy Jung: It\u2019s not that the final outcome is a Maker Dai badge. Federico is mentioning that could be a possibility 53:39 - DeFiFrog: I read over the fellowship application again and, like you mentioned, it\u2019s specific to how we assess collateral; it doesn\u2019t specify whether or not we need to include the use of Kleros in that application. Could we make sure that\u2019s clear? 55:04 - DeFiFrog: What would prevent someone from creating multiple accounts holding PNK to crowd jury pools? 56:01 - DeFiFrog: So, the number of PNK determines the weight of your vote. Does the reward for each judgment also depend on the weight of your vote or is it based on equal distribution, on number of votes? 57:02 - I guess the ultimate goal of this is to one day have a Maker community compliance department or an officer, where that individual is doing the risk-related duties. Do you agree with that, Amy, or am I completely off? 01:01:56 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I read somewhere that there were monthly check-ins required. What are you expecting from those reports? 01:02:47 - When I go on Uniswap I get the Kleros list and it\u2019s bombarded with 40, 50 tokens that I need to add to my Uniswap account. Did Uniswap also do a Fellowship? How did they pick you to do this? 01:04:09 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: There\u2019s an issue I see with having a Maker badge. Sometimes, when I try to get projects to come to the collateral calls, it\u2019s hard to find someone from the project to come. They do know that they are being considered for Maker, but they don\u2019t participate actively. I see that as a problem if someone had to stake a couple Ether to do that 01:07:32 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Where can people find information about this fellowship and about Kleros? 01:08:21 - DeFiFrog: What\u2019s the timeline?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:08:50  Thank you, Federico, thank you, Amy, and everyone else for attending  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
