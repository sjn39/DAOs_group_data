Circulating Dai by Platform   After a look into the weekly metrics, we\u2019ll dive right into a theme emerging across the ever-growing DeFi space: OHM forks. How many are there, and how much DAI are is locked into their treasuries? Another week, another 66 million Dai to Avalanche. The side-chain now holds over 615 million DAI - good for 6.8% of the total supply. Polygon also saw a nice 19% increase in circulating Dai, with much of this flowing into two platforms:   Superfluid - A streaming service utilizing Polygon\u2019s microscopic transaction fees. Dai can be used and streamed via the platform.  Furucombo a \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d yield tracker and optimizer.  Like Polygon, we haven\u2019t heard much out of xDAI during the L1 madness, but it\u2019s starting to creep its way back up. And also like Polygon, a large chunk of that growth flowed straight into Superfluid. The chain now hosts over 32.7 million DAI, or .36% of the total supply.  OHM & its Forks  Not a header I saw myself using, but it\u2019s been that kind of year. As protocols sprout and begin to populate the plethora of layer-1 options, we\u2019re seeing a lot of forks. If the protocol has had previous success, it\u2019s likely been forked. That\u2019s the nature of open-source software, but as the saying goes - the devil\u2019s in the details. Something made quite clear after Harmony ONE\u2019s 8ight Finance suffered an attack that saw a loss of around 1.75 million. Not as gaudy a headline as some recent hacks, but given that the DAO\u2019s Treasury was held in an EOA with private keys shared over Facebook and Google Drive, clearly an issue is starting to arise. Let\u2019s take a look at the general state of these forks:   twitter.com    bludex.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a @gsg0127  You ask, I deliver. OHM fork valuations as of 12/6/2021 9:15am EST! $FORT $SQUID $SPA are in the lead for best values at the moment. $FORT is still somewhat new, but I just took a nibble this morning. $SQUID is well-established and probably has the fastest growing treasury. https://t.co/HyY9YR1awI   2:23 PM - 6 Dec 2021           290                77            The above takes a given protocol\u2019s market cap and sets it relative to its locked value. By this (admittedly limited) metric, the vast majority of these forks are significantly overvalued. Of the 14 listed (15 including the remnants of 8Finance), five use Dai as backbone collateral in their treasuries.  Together these five protocols manage nearly 1 billion USD and around 540 million DAI. And of those, three have treasuries with DAI representing 50% or more of the total locked value.  The original, OlympusDAO, with ~55% of its treasury backed by DAI. Fantom\u2019s HectorDAO holds a staggering 92% of its treasury in DAI. And Spartacus, also a Fantom project, with a 79% DAI backing.  These three platforms manage around 529 million DAI or 5.74% of the total supply.  Notes  Dai on Different Networks Dashboard Dai-Curious Dashboard Still having trouble with Klaytnscope. Mainnet shows active, but the explorer shows an error. Tried numerous VPN settings at this point. If it happens to be working for anyone, more than happy to update the charts to reflect the weekly growth/decline.

Avalanche started slow, but once it got rolling it never stopped. The chain dragged in another 95 million Dai last week, but AVAX isn\u2019t the only chain gaining traction. Harmony\u2019s top protocols are mostly familiar faces, and its Dai integrations are limited - but a certain OHM fork has seen the chain\u2019s circulating DAI balloon to over 33 million. Klaytn and Celo also saw their fair share of highs-and-lows, which got the better of the Celo chain - but the former has steadied and is beginning to trend back up. Read on for the full scoop! Circulating Dai by Platform    Avalanche  Avalanche\u2019s primary bridge is the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge (AEB), whose contract holds nearly 100% of the Dai bridged to AVAX. All told, the chain now accounts for over 578 million Dai or around 6.3% of the total supply.   Klaytn Klaytn went and eclipsed the $1bil TVL mark while no one was looking. Built by the team behind the social media platform Kakao, along with the backing of a plethora of big name investors, Klaytn\u2019s focus is to provide an \u201centerprise-grade, service-centric\u201d platform upon which user-friendly blockchains can be deployed for corporate use. And it\u2019s worked pretty well so far, as evidenced by their selection for the Central Bank of South Korea\u2019s CBDC pilot. That said, it\u2019s rarely all smooth sailing. A chain outage in mid-November saw both prices and userbase decline, but it\u2019s since steadied and now looks primed to retake the lost ground. Over 61 million Dai now lives on Klaytn, or nearly 0.7% of the total supply.. Its primary DEX, and protocol period, is KlaySwap, which at the time of writing is maintaining a hearty 91.61% on-chain dominance. Naturally, the majority of the Dai living on the network is moved or parked on KlaySwap. Here\u2019s a look into its current landscape:   A Look into Up-and-Coming Layer-1s     Celo The Celo chain lost another 34% of its circulating Dai over last week after internal struggles went public. The Optics bridge, utilized natively by Celo, was placed in Emergency Shutdown mode and remained locked for hours. Fingers were pointed and explanations made, but the end result is the loss of nearly 70% of its circulating Dai over the last 14 days.   Harmony Harmony, on the other hand, has been trending up. The current protocol offerings are sparse, and the Dai integrations even more so, but the chain has still managed to amass over 33mil Dai - or a 37% increase over the last 7 days. A few of its protocols are familiar faces, like Sushiswap and Curve (though in fairness, if a chain exists these two will be there), but a handful of Harmony originals are bolstering the recent growth.  The first is Euphoria (WAGMI), an OHM fork that\u2019s recently taken off on the chain. The second is ViperSwap, which is based on elements of both Uniswap and Sushiswap.
