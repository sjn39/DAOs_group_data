The payment was confirmed on etherscan also my ether was deducted successfully as you can see here (zkSync Explorer). But gitcoin is missing my contributions, I tried adding it manually but it didn\u2019t work. Now my account is showing zero contributions. I received notifications from gitcoinbot about my transactions was successful but my profile rank was not updated. My gitcoin handle is: @minhdust98. I asked for help on discord but there was no response. I found out many users had the same problem as I am on discord. Hopefully, Gitcoin\u2019s dev could see and fix this problem. ",
