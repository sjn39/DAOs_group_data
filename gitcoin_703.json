            "body": "After some conversations with the Akita community it has become clear that the best path to maximize our ETH outcome is to enable some form of participation with them.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThere will be a buy back and burn program that funds the AKITA LBP, for every 1 AKITA purchased X will be burned. Specifics not finalized.\n\nThe ETH raised here will be put into the LBP with a time of completion set for 3 months.\n\nBased on our conversations I propose the following:\n\nOption 1:\n\nWe split the LP Tokens as follows:\n40% to Gitcoin\n40% to Akita (streamed over the length of the LBP through Sablier)\n20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale.\n\n\nOption 2: \n\nWe split the LP Tokens as follows:\n80% to Gitcoin\n20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale.\n\nWe agree to burn more Akita via Sablier by streaming to the 0x000 address Y tokens for each X Akita in the LBP.\n\nOption 3:\n\nWe don't split the LP Tokens\n\nWe agree to burn more Akita via Sablier by streaming to the 0x000 address Y tokens for each X Akita in the LBP.\n\nWithout a serious burn or a share of the ETH being raised, AKITA is not in a position to cooperate.",
