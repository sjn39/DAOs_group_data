A key concept that this work will introduce is how the protocol will allow communities to configure voter/donor eligibility. After several design sessions, we\u2019ve coalesced around a solution where we introduce the concept of a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d contract into the protocol \u2014 this is a new contract that would live alongside the current constellation that each round requires (round core contract, voting contract, and payout contract). The benefit of setting this logic as a separate contract is modularity and flexibility \u2014 it gives the protocol a lot of room to develop new methods of voter eligibility without having to change other core contracts. The tradeoff is that it requires the deployment of another contract for each round. We\u2019d love to hear thoughts from the community on this: What do you think about having a standalone \u201cgatekeeper\u201d contract to handle voter eligibility?     Yes \u2014 love this idea Not sold \u2014 we\u2019d like for you to consider another approach     0 voters     Thanks for sharing your thoughts! ",

Could this not be achieved with some combination of interfacing/interaction between the existing contracts, and allowing enough flexibility in the parameters for each of those pieces instead of introducing a new contract? Modularity is great but so is making sure each piece communicates well with the whole.  ",

From @kyle:  do we know how much this might impact the cost of the round if we deploy, now four contracts, to mainnet?  Good question! We have not done a formal analysis of deployment cost yet, but it\u2019s on our radar. Our goal is to make sure that this is an affordable process for communities. From @safder:  One other tradeoff I can think of is that this adds an additional potential point of failure/complexity that could break when Round Managers try to run their own rounds without developer help.  We\u2019re designing with non-technical communities in mind and are building our contract structure alongside a UI that handles all of this. Non-technical communities won\u2019t have to worry about figuring out the underlying contracts. From @alexdwagner:  I\u2019m also curious how this will work with Passport? Is this something that might be rolled into Passport at some point?  We actually designed this with Passport in mind! By pushing the logic to the Gatekeeper contract, you have the flexibility to say things like \u201cuse Passport for gatekeeping\u201d or \u201conly allow holders of XYZ NFT to vote\u201d. ",

Is this something that might be rolled into Passport at some point?   Oh yeah so thinking out loud on this Scenario : We are building a gatekeeper layer into the protocol which serves as an eligible voter list. We\u2019d end up supporting different gatekeeper strategies one of them being passport gatekeeper Flow: Round creator creates a round \u2192 selects the passport gatekeeper strategy \u2192 where they would provide min score/some other attribute Anytime a voter wants to vote \u2192 the frontend would talk to the gatekeeper contract \u2192 which would talk to passport contract to fetch the score and return if user can vote / not (edited) The beauty of the design is that \u2192 we can build out different flavours of it. To the round operator \u2192 it\u2019s just a matter of choosing if they want to use a gatekeeper and if so which one and provide data for it ",

                    "content": "Hello and HNY everyone  Thanks for sharing this with the Gitcoin community, this is a novel approach and as a steward and ex contributor I honestly trust the GP team decision to create a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d contract. I think the feedback depends on the POV of the person reading. If you are a Gitcoin contributor you may have a different opinion from a round manager. Because there are more types of round managers( some representing big orgs, some will be people like me who want to experiment and support PGs and people that build for the common good)  an interesting idea would be to ask potential round owners for feedback also (if you believe it would be valuable) and try to learn from their collective opinions, but I guess that is kinda out of the scope of this post. But, as Kyle said above, the costs will be the main interest of people that want to create small rounds. Some rounds may only distributed thousands of dollars, a cost of deployment of over 100$(mainet) can be an issue for those who are just starting out. Update: It\u2019s cool 2 see that the contract is optional.  ",
