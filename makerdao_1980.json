Paragraph Summary As a community, I believe that we know a core part of the appeal of holding MKR tokens is the \u201cburn\u201d feature that should drive value to MKR holders over time. It makes sense why that feature is turned off right now\u2026 but I fear that if it is turned off for too long, current and especially prospective MKR investors may forget that it is a feature all together. At $100/day, the impact on our surplus buffer is not a material amount. Additionally, if we as a community believe that Maker is going to be successful, buying the MKR token at these price points should yield a beneficial return over the coming years.  Motivation  Send a clear message to MKR holders that the \u201cburn feature\u201d of this protocol is still an intended part of our future, even if it is practically suspended for now during this crypto bear market. Place a small amount of psychological pressure on those shorting MKR\u2019s token on the open market that the burn feature is indeed returning. MKR is not to be shorted with impunity. In the future, when we choose to increase the burn amount, it will be similar to a publicly traded company announcing an increased buyback of stock. This will allow us to show confidence in the future of the MKR token. Buying small quantities of MKR tokens at such a depressed price is likely to generate a positive return on this initiative when viewed a couple years from now.   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Name Good Faith MKR Micro-Burn  DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Risks & Unwanted Outcomes  Risk that the surplus buffer is entirely depleted and there are no funds to burn $100/day Risk that $100 is viewed negatively as being too small and becomes a discouragement rather than an encouragement to MKR holders Transaction costs of a $100/day burn may be too high of a percentage of the daily spend   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Duration  The intention is for this to be a permanent feature, but for the sake of having a termination provision, it can be set to run for five years.   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation General & Specific Parameters  In order to minimize gas fees, the $100/day burn would be executed in a single transaction of $700/week. For purposes of branding/marketing, I think the concept of \u201c$100/day\u201d sounds better than \u201c$700/week.\u201d But in practical application, the transaction can occur once per week. Purchased on the open market The hop, lot, scope, and yen will be set by the Risk-001. The dollar amount is so low, allowing them professional discretion here is not of significant concern.   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Amount Requested on Annual Basis, Schedule of Funds Deployment & Source of Funding  DAI equivalent = 700 Schedule: Weekly Fund Transfer: Once per year transfer of $36,400 (edited from one per week of $700) Funding Source: Surplus Buffer   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Management & Oversight  Oversight Bodies: Risk CU has indicated they would be happy to manage this project. It\u2019s a small scope and should not require too much time.   DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Code Auditing & Audit Financing  The audit for dssKiln has been done  Official Contact of DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Oversight Group: Risk Core Unit. Contract Email/Handle: @Risk-Core-Unit Date Added: yyyy-mm-dd Operation Duration: 5 years. Amount Requested on Annual Basis and Total per Duration: 36,400 DAI annually for 5 years, 182,000 DAI total. Source of Funds for Operation: Surplus Buffer. Type & Schedule of Asset Deployment: Annual transfer. Schedule of Reporting on Performance: N/A Required Audit: No Source of Financing for Audit: N/A  ",

Wanted to mention, that there is another \u201csymbolic\u201d burn proposal outstanding, which was accepted by governance, but given the large amount of time has passed since then and the initial controversy around the SR, the consensus within CUs is that it should be put to vote again. Just wanted to mention this here, because both options are valid, and preferably one of them should be chosen, as we do not want to have two permissionless open market operations with the same goal and most likely interacting with the same market to be deployed at the same time. Main differences between them;  Old one would burn up to 3M dai per 3 months New one would burn 182.5K dai per 5 years  The new proposal is much lighter in spending and long-term, so in terms of symbolic burning, it is perhaps more suited, assuming that the community is satisfied with it.     Leritu:    Fund Transfer: Once per week transfer of $700.   Funding Source: Surplus Buffer     This is to my understanding proposed to be vested from SB, perhaps the one time deposit would be preferable here, to minimize gas consumption, since the total amount is not significant. Once again, my apologies for not pointing out this prior to formal submission. In the case where the governance and community accepts this proposal, Risk CU will be happy to provide necessary additional input relevant to specific parameters (basically which exact market will be utilized), and later provide the oversight function - monitor and report on the performance of the strategy per MIP74.

As a part of the upcoming endgame constitution MIP I\u2019m proposing that we use the new burn mechanic to do a burn-like system, although buy-and-make rather than buy-and-burn (and also ditching the POVE, which will be proposed to be removed until it can be replaced with a fully automated smart contract solution in the future). So instead of buying and burning MKR with all surplus (which will just further centralize the MKR supply and consolidate the holdings of the few major whales), we can use the cash to buy and hold dai/steth/MKR liquidity tokens, so we buy up some amount of MKR, and also provide additional liquidity to the MKR markets, and get exposure to staked ETH, and finally increase the liquidity of dai against Staked ETH which has a major strategic benefit once we are ready to launch the EtherDai product (we can then migrate the liquidity from Steth to ETHD). By my calculations we will very within a couple of months reach 150+ million income, and should be able to maintain expenses at around 40 million, so that will result in a very significant surplus that can provide a major boost of liquidity and market activity for MKR.

My understanding from discussing Kiln with @brianmcmichael and @Derek last week is that the engineering and audit work is essentially complete and we will be ready for a first deployment this month. This is why GovAlpha, Risk and PE will be bringing forward a poll on the previously approved Kiln trial to ensure that Governance still wishes for it to proceed. Although it obviously doesn\u2019t have to be either of these two deployments, I do think there is value to performing some form of trial of Kiln in a live environment, given that it is a useful tool that could be utilised for the buy-and-make system you describe, as well as other potential Endgame uses.

While I understand that as part of the endgame, you have big visions for how the burn feature could be adjusted\u2026 the full articulation and understanding of that is going to take some real time. Perhaps some trial and error, too. I think restoring a well understood and sorely missed burn at a slower pace is important because it takes a step back towards what the general public understands as normalcy for the protocol.   As @Patrick_J mentioned, the required resources here are ultra minimal\u2026 especially when combined with the benefits of testing some of the functionality that @Patrick_J mentioned.   Lastly, by restoring the burn in this very cost controlled manner, we can more rapidly increase the burn in the future without having to reengineer anything.   ",

It proposes restarting MKR burning at the rate of 100 DAI per day. The DAI required for this will be removed from the surplus buffer and DssKiln will be used to purchase MKR on the open market. The author suggests that the symbolic value of continuing to burn MKR is important for MKR holders and potential investors. To avoid high gas costs, the burn could be implemented in practice in larger batches. The proposal suggests 700 DAI per week. A similar symbolic burn proposal albeit with a much larger burn amount was passed off-chain and failed on-chain recently.

Why do we compare MKR with ETH and not with ALGO, Shiba or Dogecoin?

Not only, besides the price, the 2 assets are also quite different in their utility\u2026 And should we also touch on the Total supply and token distribution? Nah\u2026 And as a cherry on top, both tokens are strictly connected to the actual market condition and price of BTC.     Ber10:  People that said oh the burn isnt doing anything. It did alot for the token.   Well\u2026so you are going to say that burning of 1000$ moved the token price up to +30%? Just for note\u2026MKR Market Cap - $697,000,061 So you are telling me that burning of 1/700000 part moved the price of tokens +30%? Right?

I am saying that the burn as it was did do something for the price. Not this I didnt even know there was any burn. MKR went down in ratio to Eth and underperformed massively other defi tokens. And the reason why Eth matters is because MKR and Eth are intertwined. If Eth goes up so does MKR even if no action was taken by MKR. Its the benchmark for the ethereum ecosystem. Its the base layer for all defi. So looking at eth makes sense. Also most people exchanging eth for a token to outperform Eth. MKR investment doesnt make sense unless it outperforms Eth. Its incomprehensible to me that you seem to think Eth is just a coin like any other for the MKR ecosystem. Its the base layer for MKR and its value is tied to ethereum. Losing against Eth means its losing importance and impact in Defi. And its at All time Low currently. Meaning MakerDao was never as irrelevant as it is today. And I am calling it a shitcoin because it performs like one. Its worse than some actual shitcoins. Its just token so no need to be offended its not like I insult the holders, which I am one of. But a very very unhappy one. ",
