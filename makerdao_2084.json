I wholeheartedly sympathize with all of you on this point. How can progress be made if all of the DAO\u2019s members\u2019 mental bandwidths and energies are not entirely focused on addressing such matters? A functional organization such as ours should never stand for such things under any circumstance. Every penny must be accounted for. Most importantly, the collective energy invested towards these ends is, without question, justified. So, to that end\u2026 despite my long hiatus, I see many remain faithful to this highest value.    During the brief time of my mandate and my core unit\u2019s existence, although I was consistently delivering deliverables\u2026 despite my best efforts, distributing at every conference, drop shipping to North of 200 or 250 recipients, alas, there was a decent batch merch that remained. And my earlier tweet? To even suggest selling this stuff privately? How dare I? Truly unacceptable & inappropriate. I deeply deeply regret my earlier behavior. The audacity I had even to post such a thing\u2026 is truly unforgivable. I had already received my lead parachute after my offboarding\u2026 and for me to show no gratitude? Unacceptable. Regrettably, this will be difficult for me to live down.  OK\u2026 that\u2019s probably enough sarcasm for a public forum! If anyone has an issue with my trying to unload the remnants of this merch publically\u2026  please, don\u2019t be shy! Let me know personally. <3  If the community misses this particular batch of merch so much, I would be more than happy to accept fair compensation to distribute it (and much more) at our next event/s. If we\u2019re still undecided about what \u201cfair compensation\u201d is, I\u2019m more than happy to participate in that discussion. However, if somehow, I\u2019m expected to continue to pay out of my own pocket going forward (like I did for years before any budget for me was passed)\u2026 even to simply \u201creturn\u201d the few boxes of merch. Well\u2026 just going to leave with \"thank you for the great memories and connections. I truly enjoyed working with so many of you. <3 ",
