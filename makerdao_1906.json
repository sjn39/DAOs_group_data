                    "content": "Hello all, It came to our attention that MANA-A vault type risk severely increased, mainly due to decrease in collateralization. MANA used to be one of the most collateralized vaults, and therefore did not present immediate risk. Unfortunately as the price of MANA decreased over recent months, the vaults did not manage to maintain the collateralization ratio.  988\u00d7323 31.1 KB  One particular user, which could be the owner of all of the existing vaults, or at least majority of them, is not particularly active. In cases where the vaults would not be protected, the slippage produced from liquidation of one of the vaults could produce cascading liquidations.  1317\u00d7742 83.7 KB  In defense of the situation, MANA has demonstrated strong CEX trading volume, where a large part comes from venues, which are currently still considered sound and operational - Coinbase and Binance. Assuming market actors will participate in arbitraging MANA on-chain markets with CEX spot market quick enough, the slippage will be less severe after the collateral auction is settled. Nevertheless, we would prefer to recommend to immediately lower exposure towards MANA, and therefore propose intermediate measure to incentivise debt repayment and consequent exposure reduction and to further incentivise vault owners to prevent liquidation events;  Decrease DC to 3M dai from current 10M Significantly increase SF to 50% from current 7.5% Increase liquidation penalty to 30% from current 13%  We believe 3M exposure would present significantly less risk in case of large market drawdown, as price slippage is the main constraint. The stability fee increase should further convince the vault owners to either reduce the exposure or entirely move their positions elsewhere. The liquidation penalty increase could be controversial, but we strongly believe vault owners should do their best to prevent liquidation events and should be penalized accordingly. In cases where CEX <> DeFi arbitrage is not quick enough or CEX trading volume is not sufficient to absorb the needed liquidity, vault owners will likely lose the majority of their collateral in collateral auction due to large slippage.

We thought about proposing an urgent change this week but in reality the parameter changes alone won\u2019t really make a huge difference for Maker if it comes to liquidations. The key is to relay this message to the end borrower and them to unwind which Growth should help us with. If this whale borrower reacts and closes his loans we\u2019ll address the proposed changes again next week and potentially only lower DC. Despite very low DEX liquidity we also think the auction parameter\u2019s were well set in the past to handle liquidations and not cause cascading events (because of low auction throughput, better CEX liquidity should help offset high slippage on AMMs).

Given the recent market turmoil, we were watching this closely, although not taking action unless necessary. We\u2019re aware that the CEX/DEX liquidity has been heavily diminishing since August, and will look for ways to reduce the risk premium. We\u2019ll be reducing the positions in the coming weeks, but a DC of 3M would definitely put MANA-A at risk of de-listing. Even though it\u2019s not a particularly interesting token for the protocol in the short term, we\u2019re strong believers in the Maker project and MANA-A has been a profitable collateral, so I hope the DAO refrains from further decreasing the DC or increasing the SF.
