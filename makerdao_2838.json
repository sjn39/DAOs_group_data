I have come into it because it is currently used/experimented in the 1Hive DAO in xDAI, but the idea itself has been conceived/developed within the Aragon DAO community. TLDR: When you place your MKR tokens to vote, their \u2018weight\u2019 is initially zero, and it grows over time (following a certain curve) up to a certain limit. I\u2019d like to hear the opinion of the MakerDAO community about this voting method. For me it looks particularly attractive because (as observed in the article):  it is a pretty simple idea to prevent sudden Governance attacks. If an attacker proposed and tries to approve a bad proposal, it will take some time for their MKR to \u2018mature\u2019.   Vote buying (borrowing MKR to vote, last minute, on some proposals) would need to become vote renting (for a longer amount of time) creating an interesting token-economics.
