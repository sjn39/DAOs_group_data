                    "content": "From the beginning, the Collateral Engineering Services (CES) Core Unit\u2019s philosophy was to look at our collateral as a product and manage each product line (individual collateral) in what is traditionally referred to as a product lifecycle. As the CES team was onboarded at the beginning of the year, our focus was iterating and operationalizing the Collateral Onboarding Process (COB) in what we called Version 1. While we still have work to do and have plans for more iterations, another important part of our mandate is to manage onboarded collateral or what is traditionally referred to as Collateral Management (CM). We recently updated the Collateral Management Lifecycle (CML) diagram based upon our current experiences and what is actually needed by the protocol.  3108\u00d71286 351 KB  For the purposes of this update, I want to give the community some context with this forum post. Much of what I am going to discuss was already in the CES mandate so there are very few high-level unknowns. The real work is to ensure we have coverage for the actionable items with a plan to move forward.  Current Situation MakerDAO is in a transition from a variety of perspectives. At times, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the daily flow of information and forming opinions about what will happen next. The challenge of any transition is to continue to focus on the work at hand until the actual change is confirmed by an authoritative source. For us in the DAO, that is the MKR voting process. Today Maker has real needs, especially with our Real World Assets (RWA). There is the process of onboarding collateral as well as ensuring those assets are performing as intended. Collateral is what keeps the protocol alive and healthy. Until we have confirmed changes in the direction of our collateral, it\u2019s business as usual. Recently, the collateral stakeholders and domain teams identified some gaps with our RWAs. This lead to some confusion and I am hoping this forum post will give the community some answers on the plan moving forward. Before I go into the actions section, it\u2019s important to point out the original intention of Core Units. Over the past three years, I worked closely with many of the original MIP authors. Recently, I had a chance to talk with a few of them since I\u2019ve been confused with how centralized Maker acts. What first started out as autonomous and decentralized core units turned into something resembling departments in a traditional organization. Bringing in \u201cbest practices\u201d from past lives might have contributed to this. It could be a case where the DAO needed to emphasize communication over collaboration. Or maybe we\u2019re all just human and this is how we learned to work. For me what is important is, where do we go from here? I\u2019m looking at all aspects of my core unit and it\u2019s clear I need to reduce dependencies, specifically with how we get our work done. For example, expanding the use of domain experts is one way to do this. At times the expert might be in another core unit; other times it might be a qualified third party. The view is every individual, group, or company outside of the CES core unit is effectively part of a pool of contractors. By decreasing the dependencies on any one person or group, CES moves into a position to fully own and execute a project and therefore set meaningful goals with the DAO to achieve real accountability. One of the costs of decentralization is redundancy. For example, what if two core units provide similar or the same service(s)? In the traditional world, that would be considered a waste of money. In a decentralized world, it\u2019s actually an asset. It provides flexibility, scaling, reduces the lottery factor, and adds a bit of competitiveness, all of which benefits a decentralized organization. Please keep the above in mind as you read this update. There are cases where another core unit\u2019s proposed work might overlap the CES mandate. These cases are consistent with original intent of core units and decentralization. Where there are differences of opinion, the MKR holders can show their preference using the governance framework.  Current Actions Four areas of attention and focus are needed right now:  Active collateral applications Onboarded collateral External collateral relationships with applicants and onboarded projects RWA deal signaling   Active Collateral Applications The Collateral Status Index (CSI) is the definitive source of applications moving through the onboarding process and active/onboarded collateral. After the successful budget allocation vote for RWAs, CES is fully enabled to holistically manage the collateral onboarding process and implementation with the collateral stakeholders and domain teams. We appreciate the support of the community! As of today, CES will be picking up and managing the professional services work for all RWA collateral applications. We will be contracting help in the legal, credit, deal/term, risk, and auditing areas. If you have qualified contacts in each of these areas, please refer them to me. Your referrals are greatly appreciated. We look forward to working with our contractors to resource the required services to onboard Maker collateral. I\u2019d also like to point out that CES is not actively originating deals. While we will advise prospective collateral applicants on the process and technical aspects of onboarding, RWA origination is outside of our scope at this time. I\u2019d like to specifically call out MIP65. The collateral stakeholders and domain teams are in active engagement with the implementation plan and we are making progress. There are no major blockers at this time. We will update the community on an executive vote date when available via the CSI.  Onboarded Collateral CES continues to monitor active decentralized and RWA onboarded collateral. Based upon our experience with SocGen and HVBank, we need to extend the current Collateral Management work to all active RWAs. This includes activities like reporting, data collection, auditing, etc. With decentralized collateral, there is already a variety of data sources and monitoring in place, namely with the MOMC, so this is not our focus at the moment. As a first step, CES will be reaching out to all the onboarded RWAs to connect/reconnect, help set near-term expectations, determine gaps, and build a plan to move forward. Once we have a better idea of the next steps, we\u2019ll share the results with the community.  External Collateral Relationships It\u2019s clear there needs to be a point of contact for external collateral relationships so that people don\u2019t feel dropped or ghosted. CES will act as that contact until the RWA origination approach is determined. While our answers might be limited, everyone will get a reply.  RWA Deal Signaling During a transition, plans typically take much longer to solidify than one would like. In this interim period and while we keep the collateral moving through the system and healthy, CES thinks it\u2019s important to signal to the community the types of RWAs MakerDAO is willing to onboard. The collateral stakeholders and domain teams will work with the community to develop a short-list of RWA types MakerDAO feels is appropriate to onboard at this time. This will be done using onchain polling. The goal is to limit the RWA onboardings and work to conserve Maker\u2019s resources. Once a collateral application is Greenlit, it takes a lot of energy from the teams to provide an assessment, including collateral that the DAO determines not to onboard. We must be smarter with our resources.  Next Steps CES is currently underway with the actions in this forum post. I appreciate constructive feedback and pointing out if I missed something. Again, I\u2019m soliciting referrals in the legal, credit, deal/term, risk, and auditing areas. Please DM if you have anyone you\u2019d like to send my way. ",
