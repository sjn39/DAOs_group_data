I think that will help people migrate once it\u2019s obvious the APYs are higher on v3. I\u2019m not quite sure how would that exactly work because of the fragmented liquidity on v3 but still, some esimated data would be nice. ",

If there is site that compares the APYs per pool for various DEXes, and Uni v3 is as good as they say, that will quickly drive much more TVL. apy.vision is also working on it, but in the meantime why the main uni analytics site doesn\u2019t show it like it did for v2? Is it because it\u2019s different for everyone based on the ticks you use? Even if that is the case some kind of average would be nice. ",
