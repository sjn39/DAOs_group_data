Benefits: It is very friendly It has no problems with any other species. It gets along well with everyone. He is like a giant hamster and I think we all like hamsters. Why go hand in hand with makerDAO? He is sociable He lives in a community or herd. It has unique characteristics in itself, which makes it an inclusive animal when living with different species, which goes hand in hand with DAI which is money for everyone. I think these are the most important points to consider it as an optimal pet for MakerDAO.
