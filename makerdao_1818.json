K1872:  how does Maker prevent spam attacks where malicious actors send tokens to the address to initiate a shutdown even though there was no emergency scenario?   Because MKR tokens sent to the ESM are burned, this disincentivizes people from spamming the module as they lose their tokens. Maker Governance, therefore, needs to strike a balance between making the ESM prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to abuse as well as achievable to trigger in a true emergency scenario. Note the current status of the ESM is visible here. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that when ESM is triggered and MCD is shut down, nothing is stopping MKR holders whose tokens have not been burned from voting to start a new version of the system.
