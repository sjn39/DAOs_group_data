                    "content": "Hey everyone, Johnny TVL and I recently published Messari\u2019s Q4 report on MakerDAO. The report is behind Messari\u2019s enterprise paywall but we are sharing the PDF freely here: https://messari.io/report-pdf/c9b915493bb3e94fdd7744f4a6eaa29aed23aeba.pdf This quarter we specifically looked at Maker through the lens of it being a decentralized bank. We hope this report is helpful and would love to hear your feedback. We realize that Steakhouse also does financial reports for Maker, and they do a great job. We always cite @SebVentures in the charts and tables where we used those queries. We are sharing the report here in an effort to be helpful to the DAO and community, so we\u2019d love to hear feedback or suggestions on where we can do better. One thing we\u2019re thinking about is a framework for displaying the \u201cworking capital cycle\u201d. In working on our accounting for MakerDAO, we found a need to reconcile the difference between measured revenues and realized revenues. We drafted up the table below to measure changes in accounts receivable. The source of truth is the DAI surplus, so this measure does not take into account GUSD unpaid revs and assumes those remain in the PSM to be compounded. We are working on building a tool with our subgraphs to check position data and pull this a second way (i.e. be able to measure how much \u201caccrued\u201d revenue the DAO has at any one time based on the loans that are still outstanding) and be able to show a static picture of how much accrued revs the DAO has earned at any time, versus this flow metric. Thoughts on the framework we are using here and if this is helpful? At the moment the capital buffer for the protocol is very large but as RWA loans grow and the potential asset-liability mismatch grows, understanding the \u201cworking capital cycle\u201d could be really important.  image1656\u00d7235 38.6 KB  Again, we hope you find this helpful. MakerDAO is an incredible organization that we have the utmost respect for and understand we need to earn our way to being a paid contributor and service provider here. We will continue to work to do so and really appreciate any feedback or direction on how we can get there. ",

Thank you for providing this Q4 report to the community\u2013much appreciated. Perhaps taking a look at MIP103 and MIP105 might help with gauging at the community\u2019s sentiment towards the \u201cworking capital cycle.\u201d Your thoughts/comments are also welcome\u2013the community can always use the help. While we can All agree the working capital cycle for  RWAs on-boarded would likely be longer than for ETH collateral since RWAs are generally illiquid and not as easily tradable as cryptocurrencies, MakerDAOs current focus is on finding liquid RWA assets that can easily be sold (short-term bonds, money-market-funds, etc.). However, we believe the community understands that the working capital cycle for short-term bonds would still depend on the specific terms of the bond, the interest rate, maturity date, and liquidity of the bond market. After all, risk is real and fear is a choice.  ",
