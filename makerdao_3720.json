The last crash depressed lending rates and leverage seems on the fall. Institutions are coming strong so I don\u2019t think rates will go back to double digits for a long time anyway. Liquidation 2.0 showed it\u2019s working well. I think this is an opportunity to push significantly rates down and do a marketing push at the same time. I would suggest that we push SF to 3% for ETH-A and WBTC-A and 0.5% for ETH-C for 3 months (the summer). Such commitment would be stopped if PSM-USDC goes below 500M (which is thought is a good buffer to have) as the DAI peg is of paramount importance. We should still be profitable (I took 32M of expense from makerburn because the MKR compensation is really unclear yet anyway but that gives you an idea). I made a quick spreadsheet here.  image992\u00d7330 10.8 KB  Taking such a bold move makes sense only if we are united as a community to push the campaign (otherwise we will end up in the worst case of the spreadsheet). We still have some funds in the interim multisig to pay for a design piece I guess.    Should we launch the DeFi Summer by MakerDAO?  yes no abstain     0 voters     The MOMC is meeting on Monday, so now is the time to influence  ",

I think we should decide the amount, the dc and the normal tout. With the current tout set up at 0 we will sell usdc before the dai get to 1. Which is good in away as we sell before the curve of \u201ccurve\u201d gets flat but not that great as the dai won\u2019t be at peg until we empty the PSM.

However, I voted No and here is why:  In the present market situation, reduced fees could make perfect sense on their own without the additional argument that we are starting a marketing campaign. Using marketing as the reasoning behind lower fees would make the decision appear political instead of relying on the Rates team to use their sound judgement. Maybe at a later stage.      SebVentures:  Additionally, we are not super competitive with Aave/Compound.    Overall, stablecoins are presently in the strong growth phase natural to successful new products. Accordingly, it makes little sense to start a zero-sum marketing campaign directed at taking market share from Aave/Compound when there is plenty of growth possible by simply growing the total market. It is just like playing Civilization or any other 4x strategy game - you do not start a war with neighbours while there are loads of tiles still available. Maker presently does not have a marketing team, some would say we never had one, able to exploit such an initiative. First, we need a team with the necessary power levels, both in terms of quality and volume, in the relevant channels. Second, they would need time to plan the campaign in terms of cost and duration, and thirdly we must think through beforehand what the countermoves our competitors could use. So I think it is too early yet.  ",

Using marketing as the reasoning behind lower fees would make the decision appear political instead of relying on the Rates team to use their sound judgement. Maybe at a later stage.    Yes I agree, it is not about marketing. For me it just makes sense as currently we have nearly half of our supply at 0% and without any strategic reason.( Previously, the main reasons were that we still earnt more with a high eth rate, the second was the liquidation v1 risk, all of them are gone now). I think putting ETH-C at 0.5% or even lower bring now more value than USDC at 0%. Especially that we have liqV2 vs no liquidation. We also are going to growth the dai supply by putting the dai price down and increase our customer base. With the rate proposed I do believe the spreadsheet is a wrong estimate as we are also going to growth the dai supply massively. But for that we must allow the dai to go down to 0.9994 as previously allowed with the initial PSM set up. In addition of it, if we can bring the dai around 0.9994 we would be able to start the stablecoin vault liquidation smoothly. ",
