                    "content": "The Grants Council congratulates 31 proposers for reaching the Cycle 10 Final Review. Over the next two weeks, these proposals will be assessed by each reviewer in the relevant Sub-Committee (Growth Experiments or Builders). Each reviewer will review each proposal and assign a score based on the Sub-Committee\u2019s rubric. Proposals will be ranked based on the average of the reviewer scores in order to guide the Council\u2019s determination of grant recipients. Reviewers will reach out to proposers during this time to work toward ensuring the proposals include discrete milestones that enable the Council to determine whether grantees have performed the actions outlined in their proposal sufficiently. Here is the list of proposals for Final Review organized by Sub-Committee: Builders Sub-Committee Final Review List Atomic Links Attestation Station Interface Clique DeFunds Edge Wallet ENS Wildcard Domains fam.

Of the proposals:  26 were for Builders Grants, 46 were for for Growth Experiments Grants, and 1 was not updated to include a grant type  Both Sub-Committees worked hard to filter the proposals to determine which would be viable for Preliminary Review. Of the proposals received, 49 passed through the Intake Filter to receive a Preliminary Review. Of the Preliminary Review proposals:  24 were for Builders Grants, and 25 were for Growth Experiments Grants  The primary reasons for attrition between the Intake Filter and Preliminary Review were (a) incomplete proposals that were not updated; (b) grant size requests that exceeded the Cycle maximum and did not merit an increase in this Cycle; and (c) violations of the no sale rule. A preponderance of proposals that did not meet the minimum standards were directed to the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee. This may be due to the greater grant size maximum, which could draw moonshot applications. All proposers who applied to Cycle 10 are eligible for consideration in Cycle 11. The Council will publish guidance on Cycle 11 submissions aimed at clarifying the parameters for each Sub-Committee\u2019s assessments and at eliciting responses most relevant to each Sub-Committee\u2019s mission. Guidance and any changes to the proposal submission process will be published on February 17. The Grants Council is here for any proposer who wants to seek greater clarity on the Cycle 10 process or to seek information about Cycle 11. To access more information on the grants process for Season 3, the best place to begin is this post, which outlines the resources available to the community. ",
