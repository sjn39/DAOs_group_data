References  [HTC-DROP] MIP6 Application: Harbor Trade Credit DROP: Short Term Trade Receivables   NOTE: Since Harbor posted its MIP6 application, a set of new and more mature deals have improved the overall risk profile of the pool.   Highlights Harbor Trade Credit (\u201cAsset Originator\u201d) is a supply chain finance (SCF) provider of trade payable financing programs to corporate Buyers through its proprietary platform. It has partnered with Centrifuge as a token issuance platform and Throttle Capital as an equity (TIN) co-investor and provider of debt structuring services. Harbor offers buyers liquidity via trade credit and suppliers quick access to working capital, improving their cash conversion cycle. Buyer trade invoices are the collateral assets pooled in Tinlake smart contracts and offered as short-term structured debt to investors such as Maker. SCF is a form of trade finance that has been gaining ground over other TF products such as letters of credit over the last decade. It has an estimated 3-4% expected annual growth in the coming years. SCF payables programs are facilitated by platforms such as Harbor. This intermediary gains access to all trade documentation and direct access to buyers\u2019 financial statements and cash-flows in order to facilitate credit underwriting as well as risk and operational monitoring. Trade invoices have a 60-120 day maturity. This form of debt has a low default rate (< 1%) across the industry, similar to other trade finance products risk profiles. Harbor Trade Credit has set up a Delaware LLC (SPV) which purchases trade invoices from Harbor Trade Limited (\u201cIssuer\u201d) and receives buyer cash-flow payments at due date. Issuer will issue two tranches of ERC-20 tokens: DROP Tokens and TIN Tokens via the Centrifuge Tinlake pools. The DROP tokens (senior) will make up 90% of the pool. Harbor has attracted TIN (junior) investors to fund 10% of the subordinated tranche. The Maker vault will hold DROP with a slight discount and overcollateralisation, similar to ConsolFreight. The initial Debt Ceiling proposed is 7 million DAI. The exposure is expected to increase to 10-15M within 12 months, subject to further risk mitigation (See concentration risks covenants).  Major risks Harbor Trade is a relatively new entity in SCF with a short operating history facilitating payables financing programs. The company has only launched its first SPV in August 2020, therefore it has limited obligor payment history, investment track record and management of SPVs. Both risks are somewhat mitigated by a managerial team experienced in trade finance markets. The initial Harbor SCF program had a serious single buyer counterparty risk with Snakebyte Asia. While the Issuer has facilitated a successful 300K series with the obligor, changes in credit or market conditions could bring significant Buyer default risks to that kind of debt structure. To mitigate Buyer concentration risks, Harbor will bring a more diverse set of Buyers in different sectors, with bigger and more solid balance sheets into the SPV. Harbor has a long standing relationship with the parties and has strong due diligence on obligor\u2019s financials. An increase in Buyer numbers will also mitigate the current sector-specific concentration and the risks caused to global supply chains in the aftermath of covid19. Should any loss of market confidence occur, SCF programs are likely to be impacted and extrapolated for undiversified pools. Hence this move towards sector diversification from bigger Buyers is positive in the maturation of Harbor.  Proposed covenants All the following covenants are considered as soft (meaning no direct action taken) and any breach (and liquidation) will be enforced by either a signal request, a proposition of a MIP46 PPC, and/or a mandated actor proposal.  Allowed investments  SCF trade invoices (payables and receivables) Trade invoices due in up to 120 days Min annualized revenue (Buyer): $10 million Age of Buyers: 2+ years in operation   Concentration  Max single Buyer exposure: 30% of the DC limit utilisation (2.1M) Single Buyer exposure by limit utilisation buckets (see concentration details)   Stakeholders rules  TIN ratio: 10% Issuer TIN share: min 10% (Issuer) ; 90% other TIN investors Non-Maker DROP holders\u2019 share: 28% The RWF team has assessed that the asset originator is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months.

Harbor Trade provides supply chain financing (SCF) programs to buyers in its platform. Buyers can improve their liquidity through trade credit and extended payment terms. Suppliers have access to faster working capital, often at a discounted value. Most SCF activity comes from trade payable financing (\u201cpayables finance\u201d), where buyer-led trade invoices are the collateral in the pool. The market for SCF is expected to continue to grow consistently in the coming years, while industry obligor default rates are likely to remain low (<1%). SCF enjoys similar or lower risk profiles than other trade finance (TF) products such as letters of credit. Both the increasing digitalization of SCF platforms and companies in need of liquidity due to covid are important factors in the recent demand increase for SCF. Sources: ICC survey and ICC Trade report  Industry analysis Provide an overview of the industry where the SPV asset will be, especially what are the risk, benchmark and historical behaviour. A market comparison with other lenders can be useful as well. Harbor Trade provides its SCF solution to a number of industries. But its current main corporate buyer is the Snakebyte group, which buys consumer electronics and video game accessories from Asia and sells to retail chains in US/Europe since 1997. Snakebyte also started developing its own consumer electronics products in 2012. SCF as a sub-category of trade finance (TF) has been one of the fastest growing TF products since the GFC of 2008. The global market is worth about 16 USD Trillion in merchandise trade/year. Revenues derived from it reached between $50B and $75B in 2019. In the first three months of 2020, income from supply chain finance grew by 3% to 4% globally. In 2020, one-third of global banks expect more than 50% growth from SCF in the next five years, according to the ICC. Despite growth in SCF, trade credit had different impacts depending on the buyer industry during the covid crisis. Consumer products, such as electronics, had a slight decrease in outstanding trade payables balance between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. Average days beyond terms (DBT) which breaks down trade payables balances by overdue status (i.e. delinquency) has also had very minor effects on consumer products, where existing HTC buyers operate. An increase in DBT shows a deterioration in liquidity. Other industries, such as automotive and travel, had greater deterioration in SCF conditions. In terms of credit risk, SCF payables finance default rates were 0.13% on an exposure-weighted basis and 0.23% on obligor-weighted basis in 2018 (source: 2019 ICC Trade Register). This is comparable to other TF risk profiles. Exposure at default (EAD) and Loss given default (LGD) datasets are not available industry-wide for SCF yet. We can only assume they may be similar to other TF products (EAD = 100%, LGD = 30-38%). Key facts:  Merchandise trade/year: 16T USD global market SCF volume 2020: $1.31T USD Annual revenues from SCF: $50-$75B USD Annual growth SCF: 3-4% Industry default rate SCF payables: 0.13%   Asset originator analysis Focus on the asset originator and the kind of business that will be conducted in the SPV. Harbor Trade Credit LLC (\u201cAsset Originator\u201d) is a fintech firm focused on Supply Chain Finance (SCF) and working capital solutions to improve the cash conversion cycle of buyers and sellers. The company was founded in 2018 and is still in the startup phase. It developed its own proprietary software platform to facilitate trade financing programs (payables and receivables) with corporates. Its SCF payable enables early payments to suppliers and allows trade credit to Buyers to optimise their liquidity.  1298\u00d7554 135 KB  Harbor is a so-called \u201calternative provider\u201d of SCF. Its core business, relevant to this assessment, is to arrange supply chain finance programs directly with corporates (Buyer-led), then to package and sell the assets (trade invoices) to investors via its SPV, Harbor Trade Credit Series LLC (\u201cIssuer\u201d). Harbor has launched two SPV series: in August 2020 and December 2020 (open). Its first pool had a total of DAI 289,863 invested (89.9% in DROP) in a 65d term structure for an annualised DROP return of 9.47% paid in full on due dates. Series 2 has currently 1,252,303 DAI in pool value for an average 11% APR on DROP. The current pool is essentially financing Snakebyte invoices.  There are a number of counterparties involved in the debt structure: asset originators, co-investors and servicing entities. Due to confidentiality and competitive reasons, the originator has required that their respective roles should not be disclosed.  The asset originator managerial team is composed by a mix of supply chain finance specialists with a background in commercial banking and technologists: Bryan Maloney, President & Co-Founder  10+ years experience in SCF Director at Stenn International and other senior positions in trade finance  Andy Suen, Lead Engineer, Product & Technology  20+ years in IT across banking and fintech 13 years in IT and product development with HSBC  Joaqu\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez Krijgsman, Head of Structuring & Risk  25 years of industry experience in trade finance Senior positions at ING Commercial Banking Consultancy to IFC of World Bank, the ADB, Factor Chains International  Katie Newton, Head of Marketing and Origination  5+ years in finance and marketing Senior positions in marketing at Stenn International  The counterparty entities involved are separate companies with with the following Directors:   Harbor Trade Credit LLC: Bryan Maloney and Katie Newton  Harbor Trade Limited: Katie Newton  Harbor Trade Credit Series LLC: Bryan Maloney   Risk mitigation and defaults At time of writing, Harbor had no defaults in pooled assets assigned to the SPV. Tinlake Series 2 is pending final default results. Outside the SPV, Harbor claims to have originated more than 16M in trade payables through its programs with no defaults to date. In credit risk terms, Harbor provides a buyer-led SCF program therefore it has Buyer default risk. Given the current concentration of trade credit assets assigned to the SPV with a single buyer, buyer default risk is significant. Default rates are in line with industry (0.13%) defaults for SCF payables at < 1%. Harbor plans to mitigate these risks by onboarding bigger Corporate Buyers from different sectors in the coming months. Also, to gain access to even bigger corporate clients, with investment grade ratings, Harbor is working on a loan syndication project with other financial institutions.  Note: The RWF team had access to financial documents relating to the upcoming corporate Buyers in the pool  Harbor mitigates default risk with:  Rigorous credit underwriting process on Buyer and counterparty risk Operational risk management on relationship between Buyer and Seller Operational & Risk monitoring on Buyer trade documentation, compliance and financials Collection & validation of company, trade and credit data provided by Buyer with independent 3rd parties (e.g. D&B, ImportKey, OpenCorporates)  In case of an obligor missing payment, Harbor has structured collection procedures in place for its SCF payable assets. It consists of an automated notification system (up to 3 dpd), followed by internal collection management (at 7 dpd), workout payment schedules (7-29 dpd) to formal collection and legal action by 3rd parties (at 30 dpd). Formal default is declared at 30 dpd. Asset value is marked down to 80% of its par value at 7 dpd and to 20% at default (30 dpd). At recovery, Harbor either reclaims and sells goods or sells payables invoices to distressed asset buyers. Unjustified outstanding balance post-due leads to obligor credit limit decrease.

Issuance platform analysis Harbor Trade uses the Centrifuge Model, and details about Centrifuge can be found in the ConsolFreight risk assessment.  Implementation details Provide the mechanics of the vault management. This can follow the Centrifuge Model, the Trust Model or something specific. Please detail any deviation from the model if applicable. Harbor\u2019s implementation uses the Centrifuge Model. Let us cover some important dynamics. The issuance of senior (DROP) and junior (TIN) tokens is managed by Securitize. It follows AML/KYC compliance based on US securities rules. For US residents only accredited investors can invest in these instruments. The SPV (Harbor Trade Credit Series) issues DROP tokens for the Maker vault so that the SPV can mint DAI against NFTs deposits. The liquidation mechanism of Maker vault is defined by MIP22. Liquidation is triggered when the TIN value falls below the minimum collateralization ratio set by the governance to the asset originator (Harbor Trade Credit). As opposed to crypto-native assets, there are no keeper auctions to liquidate assets in the vault. Centrifuge has developed some mechanisms to stop new loan generation should the liquidation be triggered.  1178\u00d7483 12.5 KB  The following process map shows the sequence of possible events at different stages of the risk mitigation process: Centrifuge has designed an internal feature to protect DROP tokens. A minimum SPV collateral ratio (set at 104% for Harbor) is triggered by the Centrifuge NAV model when the value moves below its expected point (TIN is 10%). It causes the Tinlake pool to freeze further investment in DROP until the asset originator either increases its TIN investment or adjusts the portfolio. Once adjustments are done, the pool continues its operation. Whenever a liquidation is activated, all DROP from the Maker vault is withdrawn and any funds reaching the Tinlake pools will be \u201creserved\u201d to redeem DROP token holders. To prevent this extreme measure, a multi-staged approach has been designed to capture any warning signs coming from the underlying portfolio that allow time for preventive actions. This involves working closely with the asset originator to implement Risk mitigations. At each stage of the mitigation process, the Risk team will assess the course of action and propose either to reduce the debt ceiling or to activate liquidations. Given the nature of Harbor\u2019s business model, it is recommended to allow sufficient time so that they can implement mitigations in the portfolio, including engaging in a debt collection process. For supply chain financing this can be a relatively quick process, from a few weeks to a couple of months.  The Risk team will ensure other preventive actions are in place by analysing the performance of the portfolio on a monthly basis and through monitoring dashboards.   Covenants Detail This part describes every rule that needs to be met for the safety of the vault. If one rule is broken, there is a liquidation.  Allowed investments List the kind of investment that the SPV can make. Try to be as specific as possible. The investments allowed by the SPV are supply chain finance trade invoices (payables and receivables) due in up to 120 days. Advance rate is the Purchase Price of the underlying asset. For example: If the applicable discount rate is 6.00% p.a. and the Invoice payment term is 90 days, the purchase price would be 1.50% discount to the face value. Harbor uses its own proprietary credit underwriting methodology to assess credit risk and credit quality of Buyer invoices. This methodology does not involve a formal credit scoring. Any changes to underwriting methodology must be communicated to the Risk team. The Risk team will have access to any underwriting calculations performed on obligors for auditing purposes.  Minimum SPV CR ratio The minimum SPV Collateralization ratio at the SPV level ensures the safety of the vault. This will likely be lower than the max number asset / DROP in the case of Centrifuge as we want to allow at least one default before liquidation. Maker sets a minimum SPV collateralization ratio to protect collateral in the Maker vault. The SPV CR is defined as SPV CR = SPV Assets / SPV Debt. Assuming an SPV debt of 10,6M (Vault 7M DC), an average loan size of 141K and an hypothetical default rate of 6.65% (~ 5 loans), the Minimum SPV CR is set at 104%.  SPV Collateralization ratio formula E.g. Asset / debt amount with an explanation on how to get the asset valuation. This Risk team is setting up a model to track the value of the underlying supply chain finance portfolio. This will allow us to monitor the change in value on the Tinlake pool. Harbor will provide updates of their loan portfolio on a monthly basis to enable the Risk to perform ongoing monitoring and raise any concerns on its performance. The Risk team will provide a monitoring dashboard to report performance. Total SPV debt (i.e. DROP) is the sum of DROP in the Maker Vault plus DROP provided to other co-investors. Harbor will be the primary TIN investor along with Throttle Capital.  Collateralization ratio proposed threshold Harbor proposes a TIN proportion of 10% of the Tinpool. The DROP proportion will be 90%. Maker vault will likely be the largest DROP holder. It will have a collateralization ratio of 110% which creates a discount of DROP for the vault. The stability fee proposed for the vault corresponds to a high-yield bond index at ~7%. We believe Harbor exposures need to be further diversified by industry, obligor and credit quality. This is expected to come into play with new deals to be onboarded and a loan syndication scheme in the coming months. We propose to review the SF downwards once some concentration risks are mitigated and a longer pool performance track record is in place. The proposed Debt Ceiling is 7M DAI. We recommend reviewing the Debt Ceiling subject to Harbor\u2019s evidence of mitigation in concentration risks (see below).  Minimum Vault CR ratio In case the vault is again overcollateralized with the SPV debt token. Maker proposes a minimum vault collateralization ratio of 110% of all SPV debt tokens (DROP).  Minimum Vault Underlying CR ratio This is the result of SPV CR * Vault CR if all the SPV debt is used as Vault Collateral. Check the RWA Documentation for more information. Finally, we propose a Minimum Vault Underlying CR of 114%.  Concentration risks The current Harbor pool has significant concentration risks around single buyer credit exposure and sector-specific risks. It is understood this is common in supply chain finance corporate-led programs and risks are in part mitigated by short-term debt maturities. Also, with the pool increase under this deal, this concentration risk must be mitigated. To further mitigate risks with increasing exposure in the pool assets we propose the following covenants: The asset originator must be transparent about any changes affecting its internal risk assessment, underwriting, risk and operational monitoring and default handling methodologies. A monthly data file provided must reflect consistency in approach. The Risk team is allowed to conduct spot checks on any methodology or data affecting the pooled assets. The maximum credit exposure to any single obligor (i.e, Buyer) must not exceed 30% of the maximum vault debt ceiling i.e. 2.1M DAI. We recommend the following maximum single buyer credit limit exposure as the vault debt limit utilisation increases:     Limit utilisation Limit Utilisation Amt Max Single Buyer Exposure Buyer Credit Limit     20% $1,400,000 100.0% $1,400,000   40% $2,800,000 75.0% $2,100,000   60% $4,200,000 50.0% $2,100,000   80% $5,600,000 37.5% $2,100,000   100% $7,000,000 30.0% $2,100,000     The above maximum single buyer exposure must also be tempered by healthy obligor financial ratios, particularly in regards to buyer\u2019s leverage and liquidity ratios. Also these ratios will be established based on security or collateral obtained by Harbor when applicable.  Existing Harbor pools have high sector concentration risks in consumer electronics. While this reflects an \u201copportunistic\u201d allocation strategy and historical relationship with buyers, covid19 has shown the risks for sector-specific SCF program providers. As the credit limit utilisation grows we will need to review this sector concentration in the pool. Last, Harbor SCF programs do not have credit insurance against buyer defaults. Harbor claims this represents a significant operational cost for low exposures, reducing margins. We recommend credit insurance requirements to be reviewed over time as diversification and credit quality of underlying assets in the pool increases.  Stakeholders rules The stakeholders risks should at least be the financial stability of the asset originator. This part should be assessed even before the vault is opened. The risk team has assessed that Harbor Trade Credit is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months. This impression is based on an analysis of historical financial statements and internal financial projections from the company. TIN investors are providing equity in the pool. The Asset Originator will be the primary investor in TIN along with Throttle Capital. In addition, we suggest a minimum level of 28% of DROP to co-investors, as they could assist in enforcing contract rights, benefitting Maker. Harbor should keep a minimum exposure of $50K in the TIN tranche of the pool. Final Issuer TIN share for the full limit utilisation is pending update. The MakerDAO vault should not have more than 72% of the SPV DROP debt share. For corporate governance, the risk team recommends assigning an independent director to Harbor Trade Credit Series LLC. The main duty will be to avoid the SPV filing for voluntary bankruptcy. This director will also be required for performing any Material Action on the SPV. ",

Harbor Trade Credit Series LLC has appointed Orlando Figueroa from CitadelSPV as an independent manager and managing director. These changes have been implemented to enhance the isolation of our special purpose vehicle from Harbor\u2019s operating company and are in effect as of July 14, 2021. The independent manager, in accordance with our Operating Agreement, ensures that no material changes can be made to the Executive Summary unless:   Harbor has notified all DROP Investors and DROP Investor Representatives about the change by email with the Executive Summary attached showing the amendments   Harbor has posted these changes on the Maker forum   Harbor has notified investors 28 days prior to changes going in to effect   There are no open DROP redemption requests at the time changes go into effect.   The last point gives MKR holders the ability to disagree with those changes. The Maker community has 28 days to do a vote and trigger the redemption of the DROP tokens in the Maker vault if there is a disagreement. The change cannot take place as long as this redemption is not fully satisfied, meaning all DROP tokens of the Maker vault are liquidated.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters   Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 4.5% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.995 Step: 125 seconds Buf: 1.15 Cusp: 0.6 Tail: 215 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.7 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI  Overview  Protocol Summary Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap v2 with few slight changes such as introduction of governance token and its tokenomics. At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-DAI-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of dai and ether; currently it is the fifth largest pool by liquidity in the protocol, holding $244M in assets, which means there is approximately $122M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently one of the largest DAI/ETH on-chain pools by absolute liquidity and is an important trading venue for dai market liquidity. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-DAI-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-DAI-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-DAI-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP DAI-ETH tokens (99.55%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of DAI stays stable, a decline in the price of ETH will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-DAI-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in ETH, and additional losses caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-DAI-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETH percentage price change) / (2 + ETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETH percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 SLP-DAI-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in ETH price leads to 29.3% drop in SLP-DAI-ETH value, assuming no change in DAI price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between ETH and SLP-DAI-ETH price performance is shown below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 44.4 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021 Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH price and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-DAI-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than ETH. The largest price drawdown would have been 33%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 10.2 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 15.81%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-DAI-ETH was ~33%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 65.4 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, May 2021  Summary of Notable Risks   Collateral that includes DAI such as UNI-V2-DAI-ETH could increase potential losses for DAI holders if emergency shutdown occurred while there was bad debt (negative DAI surplus). If Maker took action that reduced the collateral backing of DAI below $1 (eg. negative interest rates), this may also lead to increased DAI holder losses in an emergency shutdown event.   SLP-DAI-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when ETH experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and ETH liquidity contract during a downturn.   Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is a major pair so it is likely to remain favored.   The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.    Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 4.5% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.995 Step: 125 seconds Buf: 1.15 Cusp: 0.6 Tail: 215 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.7 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here. As this collateral asset behaves very similarly to UNIV2DAIETH we propose a similar set of initial parameters with an additional premium on current stability fee of 1 percentage point as additional liquidity mining rewards offer higher expected returns for users and potentially more risk as there are additional complexities related to vaults collecting rewards. We usually recommend initiating a new collateral with a small debt ceiling, Uniswap LPs were initiated at 3m dai, but in this case we are introducing a new vault functionalities so we recommend even lower initial debt ceiling at 1m dai. Same recommendation was also made by other mandated actors such as the Oracles and Protocol Engineering team. The debt ceiling and other parameters will be adjusted after some time of testing. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for UNIV2DAIETH-A with smaller ilk.hole.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters   Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 5.5% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.995 Step: 125 seconds Buf: 1.15 Cusp: 0.6 Tail: 215 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.7 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI  Overview  Protocol Summary Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap v2 with few slight changes such as introduction of governance token and its tokenomics. At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-USDC-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of USDC and ether; currently it is the third largest pool by liquidity in the protocol, holding $332M in assets, which means there is approximately $166M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently one of the largest USDC/ETH on-chain pools by absolute liquidity. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-USDC-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-USDC-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-USDC-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP USDC-ETH tokens (99.64%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of USDC stays stable, a decline in the price of ETH will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-USDC-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in ETH, and additional losses caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-USDC-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETH percentage price change) / (2 + ETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETH percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 SLP-USDC-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in ETH price leads to 29.3% drop in SLP-USDC-ETH value, assuming no change in USDC price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between ETH and SLP-USDC-ETH price performance is shown below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 44.6 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021 Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH price and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-USDC-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than ETH. The largest price drawdown would have been 33%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 10.7 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 23.63%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-USDC-ETH was ~26%. The USDC-ETH pool has slightly higher trading activity compared to DAI-ETH pool which results in higher return from collected fees, but has lower SUSHI allocation for liquidity mining and thus results in slightly lower returns from that source. The two pools yield similar total returns.  Chart1200\u00d7742 59.2 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, May 2021  Summary of Notable Risks   This collateral type is exposed to specific USDC related risks and with addition of SLP-USDC-ETH collateral we are increasing our exposure towards these specific risks.   SLP-USDC-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when ETH experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would lower liquidity on the market which can increase slippage for other collateral types such as ETH or other tokens which are pooled together with USDC across markets.   Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is a major pair so it is likely to remain.   The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.    Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 5.5% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.995 Step: 125 seconds Buf: 1.15 Cusp: 0.6 Tail: 215 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.7 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here. As this collateral asset behaves very similarly to UNIV2USDCETH we propose a similar set of initial parameters with an additional premium on current stability fee of 1 percentage point as additional liquidity mining rewards offer higher expected returns for users and potentially more risk as there are additional complexities related to vaults collecting rewards. We usually recommend initiating a new collateral with a small debt ceiling, Uniswap LPs were initiated at 3m dai, but in this case we are introducing a new vault functionalities so we recommend even lower initial debt ceiling at 1m dai. Same recommendation was also made by other mandated actors such as the Oracles and Protocol Engineering team. The debt ceiling and other parameters will be adjusted after some time of testing.

Upon acquisition of each RBF asset, the Issuer will be the legal owner of the assets and will hold the title to the asset.  This is the 7th MIP6 application to use Centrifuge\u2019s model.   1. Who is the interested party for thi\u2026     NOTE: Since Fortunafi posted its MIP6 application, a new arrangement with Pipe has improved the overall risk profile of the pool.  Highlights Fortunafi is a fund management firm partnered with Centrifuge as a token issuance platform, initially focusing on Revenue-Based Financing, or RBF, as an asset class. The firm launched a Tinlake pool with Corl as its first Asset Originator, and will shortly add Pipe as its second. RBF (sometimes known as RBI) is a form of debt finance offered to creditworthy businesses with reliable revenue streams. The two Asset Originators have different focus areas and overall sizes of deal flow, and the revenue-based return is structured differently. FortunaFi will act as an Asset Manager pooling many Asset Originators. At scale, this will provide better scaling and a better risk profile for MakerDAO RWA. For the first Asset Originator, Corl, investees are typically SMEs in digital industries, such as B2B SaaS and ecommerce. It focuses on earlier stage companies and charges a percentage of gross revenue with a buy-out amount of 1-3x at the end of a 24-month term. For the second Asset Originator, Pipe, a larger entity - one of the top three RBF firms, focuses exclusively on the SaaS revenue of much larger companies and charges principal and interest monthly with a maximum term of 12 months. Pipe\u2019s current investors are large hedge funds, some of whom also invested in their recent equity funding (Siemens\u2019 Next47 and Jim Pallotta\u2019s Raptor Group co-led the round, which also included participation from Shopify, Slack, HubSpot, Okta, Social Capital\u2019s Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff, Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Capital, Republic, Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six and Joe Lonsdale - see this TechCrunch article). Here is a high-level breakdown of the two Asset Originators:      Corl Pipe     Revenue model Fixed percentage of gross revenue + 1-3x buy-out at end of term \u201cPrincipal + interest\u201d over the term, on SaaS revenue only   Term 24 months 12 months   Type of investees Earlier stage companies in digital industries SaaS revenue of large companies   Size of investees About $1 mill annual revenue, at least $50K monthly revenue At least $5 mill annual revenue, usually much larger   Risk measurement Tech platform that performs initial assessment and ongoing monitoring, with links to bank accounts and accounting software of investees Tech-based assessment using quality tranches, of which BBB (Prime++), BB (Prime+) and B (Prime) are Fortunafi\u2019s focus   Expected monthly volume $1-3 mill $10 mill   Rate of return on assets 20-30% 5-8%   Expected pool proportion 5-10% 90-95%    Fortunafi has structured a Delaware-based SPV to house its revenue-based assets from Corl and Pipe, and receives monthly revenue from investees. The financing is tokenized via Centrifuge, and Fortunafi has attracted DROP (senior) investors as well as funded the TIN (junior or equity) tranche at 10% of the pool. The Maker vault will hold DROP with a slight discount and slight over-collateralization, in the same way as with New Silver. While the initial Debt Ceiling is proposed at 15 million DAI, the portfolio is expected to grow rapidly in the first year to a target of $100 million. The DROP rate is now being reduced to 5% to account for the much larger presence of Pipe\u2019s assets.  Major risks Fortunafi is a new entity while Corl and Pipe are relatively young. The success of the business model is somewhat proven but has not been demonstrated over a substantial time period. Mitigating this risk is the fact that SaaS and ecommerce are now established growth industries and have achieved considerable market presence. And because Pipe invests in the SaaS revenue of larger companies, the risk profile of their investments is low, with a corresponding lower return. Younger companies attracted to RBF see debt financing as preferable to giving away large amounts of equity. In fact, RBF is often used as a way to increase scale prior to a major round of equity financing, at which time RBF obligations are paid off. Corl\u2019s investees can experience bumpiness in revenue or even business collapse. Several factors mitigate this risk: Corl\u2019s technology and approach, mentioned above; the investor\u2019s senior position with unilateral claim to repayment via arbitration; an extremely tight default time window; and diversification of the portfolio. In addition, Maker proposes covenants below that would limit risk.  Proposed covenants All the following covenants are considered as soft (meaning no direct action taken) and any breach (and liquidation) will be enforced by either a signal request, a proposition of a MIP46 PPC, and/or a mandated actor proposal.  Allowed investments  SaaS or Recurring Revenue companies Ecommerce companies Min monthly revenue: > $50K/month in last 3 months Min annualized revenue - SaaS only: $1M in last 6 months Min YoY growth rate of sub-$5 mill revenue: 20% Age of Investees: 2+ years in operation or post-revenue for a minimum of 6 months   Concentration  Max single investee size: 30% of DC limit utilisation Max ratio of non-SaaS/RR investments (Corl): 30% of DC   Stakeholders rules  Issuer TIN share: 60% - or - $1 mill min (Fortunafi Holdings Inc) Non-Maker DROP holders\u2019 share: 25% - or - $1 mill and 10 investors min The RWF team has assessed that the asset originators most likely will be in business in 12 months. In the case of Fortunafi, the fund manager, the impression is the company is in early starting phase and according to the CEO has a current runway of 5 years.

Its roots go back centuries to investment instruments with returns in the form of royalty payments, though it can be argued that royalties are often defined in a limited way (usually referencing forms of intellectual property). Due to the emergence of digital businesses with recurring revenue streams, RBF has gained in significance as an attractive alternative to traditional debt and equity financing. Its risk profile is similar to debt, meaning it enjoys senior position regarding repayment of capital, while its return is higher and can be similar to equity. For investees, it provides growth capital without equity dilution and accessibility to capital when traditional bank loans may be out of reach.  Industry analysis The industry in this case is both RBF or RBI as a form of investment and the industries of investee companies. Fortunafi via Corl invests in digital industries such as B2B SaaS and ecommerce and target earlier stage companies with reliable revenue streams. Pipe facilitates investment in the SaaS revenue of larger companies. Though digital industries and SaaS encompass a wide range of markets, the assumption in this analysis is that digital industries are well known and the focus will be on startup dynamics. In \u201c2020 State of the Industry: Revenue-Based Investing,\u201d Thomas Rush of advisory firm Bootstrapp Inc.analyzes 32 RBI firms in the US with 57 distinct funds managing $4.31B in total capital. Of this total, there is an estimated $2.1B of funds allocated to RBI across all years, though the actual number is difficult to confirm as most firms are privately held, and large firms like Kapitus, United Capital Source, Braavo and Clearbanc have claimed billions of dollars in RBI investments. Arthur Fox began using RBI as a form of venture investing for startups in the 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s, and established perhaps the earliest fund called Royalty Capital in 1992. Few new firms appeared until 2005, and since then the number of RBI firms has grown at a notably faster pace. In the last 10 years (2010-20), 25 firms were founded. The three largest RBI firms are:  Clearbanc, now Clearco Shopify Capital (Shopify being an investor in Pipe, one of the asset originators) Pipe, one of the asset originators in this proposal  There are two (and possibly more) public companies:  Flow Capital Corp. Timia Capital Corp.  Pipe innovated the use of recurring revenue contracts as atomic assets that can be loaned against. Here are two articles describing the overall context and significance of this innovation:  Recurring Revenue: The Rise of an Asset Class | by JSC | Medium Debt is Coming \u2013 Welcome to Dancoland  How do those assets respond in the event of a particular major economic event? Investee companies may operate in industries that are susceptible to major shifts in the economic landscape, as we are currently seeing during the pandemic. It is clear that ecommerce has benefited greatly while traditional retail companies have not. Likewise, conferencing and online services that help companies cope with reduced travel and social distancing have also seen a boost. On the whole, digital industries have seen increased growth while some traditional industries have not, and therefore it can be expected that RBI focused on digital industries will benefit. In the case of a major economic event adversely affecting digital industries, such as the dotcom crash in 2001-3, revenues will be reduced and so will the corresponding return for some RBI investors. However, since investees have reliable revenue streams and are creditworthy to start with, the chances of significant defaults remain low. What remedial measures might be undertaken? The remedial measures are clearly defined in the Revenue Sharing Agreement (Corl) between Fortunafi and each investee, and partly in the Whole Receivable Purchase Agreement between Fortunafi and Pipe. In the case of Corl, these measures consist of a Security Interest in the investee\u2019s assets that is senior to all other interests, and a defined monthly payment process using direct debit within 7 days after month end. If payment is not completed within that time, payment can be arranged in a Resolution Period of 48 hours, and if that does not occur, Fortunafi can claim all amounts owed. Besides missing payment, other conditions of default include extending beyond the maximum term (12 or 24 months), and bankruptcy and/or insolvency. Arbitration is mandated. The details of remedial measures between Pipe and its investees are being collected and this risk assessment will be updated once they are received. What are the historical default rates in this industry? The private nature of venture firms investing in RBI deals and lack of common industry associations mean historical default rate datasets are rare. Only empirical information made public by funds in press releases or comparison to default rates in the wider venture-debt financing category can be found. Venture Lender estimated default rate to be 3% in 2016, close to US-high yield loan default rates (3.5%). These figures are also in line with private-held firms\u2019 probability of default ranges (1-4%). Empirical research also shows that increase in the following metrics reduces Probability of Default (PD) in early stage startups (< 3 years old):  Leverage Ratio: Equity / Total Liabilities (Solvability); Equity / Total Assets Coverage Ratio: Net Debt/ EBITDA (Debt-to-EBITDA) Activity/efficiency Ratio: Net Sales / Total Assets (Asset-turnover) Human Capital: Founders\u2019 Education, Founders\u2019 Management Experience   Asset originator analysis Corl uses its own technology platform to underwrite applicants with links into the companies\u2019 accounting systems and bank accounts. This direct connection into cashflows, P&L and balance sheets is then analyzed with risk parameters to determine not only a company\u2019s health at origination, but also its ongoing and future performance. Needless to say, this provides great insight into the security and size of the investor\u2019s return on investment, which is in the region of 15-30% annualized. The maturity is 24 months and investees also have a final buy-out amount which is 1 to 3x the original investment. Pipe uses a similar approach of connecting with SaaS companies\u2019 financial and accounting systems, and marries that with internal data about industries. Their rating system groups SaaS contracts into levels or tranches of quality. When was the asset originator incorporated? Corl Financial Technologies Inc. was founded in 2017. Pipe was founded in 2019 and Fortunafi was founded in 2020. What is the background of the asset originator managers? Derek Manuge, CEO of Corl, was a risk manager at ScotiaBank and KPMG, participated in the Global Association of Risk Professionals, and performed quantitative model development in his own consulting company before co-founding Corl. His extensive experience and knowledge of quantitative modeling has been central to the development of Corl\u2019s underwriting platform. Harry Hurst, CEO of Pipe, is a serial entrepreneur who developed a passion for technology early in life, graduating high school age 12 studying Computer Science. Harry and Pipe (Grow on your terms | Pipe) co-founder Josh Mangel built their first company Skurt, a financial technology company in the mobility space. After four years, Skurt was successfully acquired by Fair (https://www.fair.com/) in 2018. Pipe was founded in 2019, to unlock the largest untapped asset class in the world \u2014 revenue \u2014 to empower entrepreneurs and companies to grow their business on their terms without debt or dilution. Harry has raised over $150 million for his companies and is considered an industry expert on financial technology and emerging asset classes. Nick Garcia, CEO of Fortunafi, has over 8 years of experience in both fintech & crypto. Nick started off in fintech at Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech & Venture Group (working on deals for Lending Club, Funding Circle, Prosper, & others). He then led finance & strategy at Zenefits (https://www.zenefits.com/), a fintech & insurtech solution for SMBs, and then was the head of finance at Shippo, a multi-carrier shipping API and led the Series A & B with Union Square Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners. He started investing & trading digital assets in 2013 and Co-founded Space Whale Capital in 2018. Space Whale Capital LP is a proprietary investment firm that manages a discretionary trading strategy and has been actively investing and participating in DeFi since inception. How many deals has the asset originator already done? What is the notional amount? Corl has provided its platform to the Canadian government on a SaaS basis since 2019. The details of the Canadian government\u2019s investment program are under NDA but the notional amount of investment was roughly $5-10 mill in 2019. In 2020, Corl began to originate investments from its balance sheet and launched a small portfolio with notional value of $425K, but progress was stopped by the pandemic and 1 of 3 investees suffered a default. In late 2020, Fortunafi partnered with Corl and established a Tinlake pool. The characteristics of this Tinlake pool are as follows:  Total number of investments: 3 Total pool value: 973,002 DAI Average investment size: $300,000 Average Royalty Rate %: 4% Average Buyout Rate %: 100% - 150% Average Annual IRR %: 20% Defaults: 0 Location: US Links: Tinlake UI   Regarding Pipe, according to TechCrunch: \u201cIn the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded across the Pipe platform. Between its launch in late June 2020 through year\u2019s end, the company also saw \u201ctens of millions\u201d in trades take place via its marketplace. Tradable ARR on the platform is currently in excess of $1 billion.\u201d Fortunafi will start acquiring Pipe loan assets in June 2021. Has the asset originator experienced a default? What is the plan in case of default? One of Corl\u2019s initial investees in 2020 had a large retail footprint and was badly affected by the pandemic. The investment amount was $25K and default occurred quickly. Corl has a personal guarantee against the owner and is in first position on the business, but the court system was backed up during the pandemic. Subsequent investments mandated arbitration to avoid the standard legal process via the court system. Pipe has had no defaults so far. As noted above, this risk assessment will be updated with details of the remedial measures once received. What is the due diligence they use to accept an asset? The due diligence process is extensive. Corl\u2019s platform accesses the financial records and bank account of the investees and performs a comprehensive risk assessment. The platform assigns a credit score and generates an investment report that is reviewed by staff as part of the manual due diligence process. The overall due diligence process includes:  Owner(s) information (e.g. name, contact, equity stake) Business information (e.g. nature, duration, number of owners) Credit worthiness and credit rating of business owners Financial and banking position (e.g. profitability, financial performance, revenue history) Current number of paying customers/existing subscriptions and projected growth and/or churn Financial performance indicators (e.g. ratios) Projections and sensitivity testing of revenue growth Quality of management, product/service, and business Social profile and web search information (e.g. reviews, traffic) Risk scores and associated risk metrics derived from supplied information (e.g. supplier/dependency risk) Prospects for success of the business Material investment, financing, and operating contracts Capitalization tables, details of funding rounds, shareholder registrar Other \u201cknow your client\u201d requirements, including Anti\u2010Money Laundering provisions and company supporting documents  After origination, the Corl platform provides an ongoing view of its investees\u2019 financial performance, further reducing risk by flagging performance warnings. Pipe uses a similar approach of integrating with investee\u2019s financial systems and summarizes its use of data as follows: Data sources include but are not limited to real-time continuous access to:  Bank account(s) balance & transaction history ERP & accounting systems (e.g. Quickbooks, Xero, Netsuite etc.) contract & billing management/payment processing systems (e.g. Recurly, Stripe, Chargebee etc.) Internal Pipe data relating to historical performance across industry, company, asset & payments. (Proprietary data and models)  Here is Pipe\u2019s description of their underwriting process: Pipe Technologies has developed a proprietary Recurring Revenue Asset (\u201cRRA\u201d) Score that utilizes multiple data sources and data analytics in order to assess sell-side company quality and provide a basis for buy-side investors to make informed decisions. This methodology shares certain features with the corporate credit rating methodologies applied to issuers and instruments in the listed markets, however it is designed with the specific financial instrument - the trading of short-tenor recurring revenue streams - and the specific customer segment - companies in recurring revenue industries - in mind. What is the valuation model used? The valuation model in both cases is proprietary, but based on normal risk measures involving credit worthiness, cashflows, balance sheet and operating performance. See above. What is the nature of asset defaults for the originator, and the possible solutions? Default is primarily defined as late payment, and the default process is described above. In the worst case, Fortunafi will exercise its most senior claim against the investee\u2019s assets using arbitration. More commonly, the investee will work out a payment arrangement with Fortunafi. In the case of bankruptcy and/or insolvency, arbitration could result in a months-long process (though shorter than a standard legal process) and result in partial or total loss of the investment, though monthly payments made before that event result in some return. What are the historical default rates of the originator? The historical default rates of Corl\u2019s investees is not known, aside from the one default noted above. Since 2019, the Canadian government has used Corl\u2019s platform to fund small businesses and permission to disclose any details of that activity has not been granted. The Canadian government had adapted their program during the pandemic and is now updating it again as Canada emerges from the pandemic. Again, Pipe has experienced no defaults. What explains the difference in default rates between the asset originator and the industry? With the exception of loans originated through the Canadian government program, Corl\u2019s default rates used in its back-test are in line with industry default probabilities. However, the sample of real financing considered here is not statistically significant to do a real comparison of PD rates. Once we build a longer performance record for RBFs, we will be able to assess the quality of Corl\u2019s back-testing scenarios and score modelling accuracy. Pipe\u2019s focus on larger and more mature companies reduces default risk substantially, and since there have been no defaults, their performance to date is above any default rate.  Issuance platform analysis Fortunafi uses the Centrifuge Model, and details about Centrifuge can be found in the New Silver risk assessment. ",

Is there an independent director or trustee that would be likely to block a bankruptcy filing based on the terms of the credit agreement? If not, why?   What due diligence has been done on the applicant themselves? Is the RWF Team familiar with their beneficial ownership/what checks have been run on their beneficial ownership?   What operational controls are in place to ensure that the Dai is not lost en route to/from the applicant or their designated trading desk?   What is Maker\u2019s recourse in the event of nonperformance, breach of covenants or a lack of reporting from the applicant? I.e. how will we get our money back?

I recall this being on Centrifuge\u2019s website but I don\u2019t remember where. I think giving the community the opportunity to scrutinize the language that enforces the bankruptcy remoteness of the entity is a critical part of expanding debt ceilings.     SebVentures:  None.

I\u2019d personally be very hesitant to offer large debt ceilings without sufficient DD on the borrowers.     SebVentures:  That probably deserves an audit. But why would someone commit such fraud? In this case, FortunaFi owns a lot of TIN. Committing fraud and losing money seems a losing proposition.   Not worried about fraud, worried about user error. To provide a hypothetical: Imagine that they lose the Dai by sending it to the wrong address. The amount may eclipse their entire equity stake. What happens next at this point?     SebVentures:  Mainly liquidation. Again, the asset originator (FortunaFi) will lose money as well.   I wasn\u2019t insinuating this doesn\u2019t exist, I\u2019m just not familiar with how these assets would be liquidated. Is there a place to read more about the mechanics of a liquidation?

Could you give more of the reason for looking at beneficial ownership, and of which entities?   My main concern lies in the ownership of the entity that is drawing the Dai. From that point it would be the responsibility of that entity to perform these checks downstream. I think something like KYC/AML checks are at a minimum necessary.     Philinje:  A very general operational question that is worth discussing. With Centrifuge we are focusing on the DAI and leaving it to the AO or fund manager to handle the conversion in the best way possible.   Perhaps we can discuss this further in the committee or in a new thread as you said, but I think the way 6s is handling it is nice. The secure conduit contract is already built and approved - I don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t general purpose it to Centrifuge borrowers as well.     Philinje:  All of the structure, including Centrifuge, is our way of preventing nonperformance, but soft and hard liquidation are the tools of last resort. Perhaps the single most important safeguard is the presence of other DROP investors, which is why that is a covenant. Other people with skin in the game can help protect Maker and even pursue recourse. Since MakerDAO is not a legal entity, we have to be resourceful.   Thanks for the more detailed reply, but as I mentioned to Seb\u2026is there an outline of the specific mechanics?     Philinje:  Monitoring is pretty tight and ongoing. Seb can speak more about that. The line of credit is revolving so it is expected that loans will be paid off and new loans made, but tracking that to the actual loans is part of the monitoring.   This is good. Is there a place to learn more about what the specific monitoring entails? I\u2019d also be curious to understand (and potentially help with) how this scales. As Seb said, your team aren\u2019t functioning as underwriters so this will become pretty overwhelming at scale. @LongForWisdom can you do that thing where you magically make this a new thread?  ",

The number one issue with RWA is defaults, because they operate in the real world. There are numerous safeguards and also processes for re-couping investment when assets drop in value or the borrower stops making payments. This was detailed pretty well in the New Silver risk assessment, and here there is a summary of how Corl structures the default process. The main idea is to have the most senior lien against the asset. Mandated arbitration helps with speed of recovery. In the case of real estate there are several alternatives to actual foreclosure. And so on. But underlying all RWA is the general principle that there is an asset and it has a legal framework around it. It may take longer than a smart contract execution on Ethereum to recover the loan, but there are known processes for doing that. We also have to assume the fund manager or AO will act in their best interest to protect or recover their loans, and that is why they own TIN. ",

We\u2019re making sure we have as much scrutiny as operationally, contractually and humanly possible into the underlying quality of the borrowers. Maker is not involved in the direct underwriting process, but we ensure spot checks can be done with the Fund manager and/or Asset originator. Also, another important aspect here will be scaling up the data infrastructure to make sure a more automated 3rd party validation of underlying borrowers is in place through services like D&B, Experian or FICO. We\u2019re not there yet.     g_dip:  To provide a hypothetical: Imagine that they lose the Dai by sending it to the wrong address.   Another important consideration, from a security stand point. We\u2019ve been talking to asset originators and, where the scale justifies, we ask specifically for custodial services to be put in place as well as insurance through companies like Anchorage and the like. For larger exposures, this will mostly definitely become a hard requirement. Another aspect is standardisation of best practices for storage, transmission of tokens and key management, which we\u2019re working on with Centrifuge & the AOs to make a requirement.     g_dip:  I think something like KYC/AML checks are at a minimum necessary.   This is also in the cards for these debt structures, the inclusion of AML/KYC spots checks on borrowers and originators. In the future, we could integrate services like Plaid for these 3rd party checks, but that is probably a few steps off at this stage and will require a bit of scale first.     g_dip:  This is good.

Both have been fully executed and are effective as of July 15th, 2021. CitadelSPV (https://citadelspv.com/) has appointed Orlando Figueroa as independent manager and managing director making the SPV fully bankruptcy remote. Every interested community member can register as a DROP Investor Representative to get full notification rights without the need to sign a DROP subscription agreement and to purchase DROP tokens individually. The independent manager will ensure that changes to the Executive Summary can only be executed if:  the SPV has notified all DROP Investors and DROP Investor Representatives about the change in an email with the Executive Summary attached including deleted, replaced, and new content; the SPV has posted these changes on the Maker forum the notification has happened at least 28 days ago there are no open DROP redemption requests  The last point gives MKR holders the ability to disagree with those changes. The Maker community has 28 days to do a vote and trigger the redemption of the DROP tokens in the Maker vault if there is a disagreement. The change cannot take place as long as this redemption is not fully satisfied, meaning all DROP tokens of the Maker vault are liquidated. Please find the signed agreements here:   Independent Manager Service Agreement between CitadelSPV and Fortunafi  Updated Operating Agreement including the Independent Manager  Thanks, Nick ",

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters   Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 5.5% Liquidation Ratio: 150% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.99 Step: 130 seconds Buf: 1.3 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 200 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI  Overview  Protocol Summary Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap v2 with few slight changes such as introduction of governance token and its tokenomics. At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-WBTC-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of WBTC and ether; currently it is the second largest pool by liquidity in the protocol, holding $451M in assets, which means there is approximately $225.5M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently one of the largest WBTC/ETH on-chain pools by absolute liquidity. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-WBTC-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-WBTC-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-WBTC-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP WBTC-ETH tokens (96.82%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or WBTC will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-WBTC-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-WBTC-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + BTCUSD percentage price change * WBTC allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETHBTC percentage price change) / (2 + ETHBTC percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETHBTC percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% price drop while WBTC suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 SLP-WBTC-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in ETH price and 30% drop in WBTC price leads to 41.2% drop in SLP-WBTC-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between WBTC or ETH price changes and SLP-WBTC-ETH price performance is shown below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 42.2 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021 Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH, BTC price and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-WBTC-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than underlying assets. The largest price drawdown would have been 33%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 9.08 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 4.74%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-WBTC-ETH was ~17.18%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 56.1 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, May 2021  Summary of Notable Risks  This collateral type is exposed to specific WBTC related risks and with addition of SLP-WBTC-ETH collateral we are increasing our exposure towards these specific risks. SLP-WBTC-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when ETH and BTC experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would lower liquidity on the market which can increase slippage for other collateral types such as ETH or other tokens which are pooled together with WBTC across markets. Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is a major pair so it is likely to remain. The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.   Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 5.5% Liquidation Ratio: 150% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.99 Step: 130 seconds Buf: 1.3 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 200 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here. As this collateral asset behaves very similarly to UNIV2WBTCETH we propose a similar set of initial parameters with an additional premium on current stability fee of 1 percentage point as additional liquidity mining rewards offer higher expected returns for users and potentially more risk as there are additional complexities related to vaults collecting rewards. We usually recommend initiating a new collateral with a small debt ceiling, Uniswap LPs were initiated at 3m dai, but in this case we are introducing a new vault functionalities so we recommend even lower initial debt ceiling at 1m dai. Same recommendation was also made by other mandated actors such as the Oracles and Protocol Engineering team. The debt ceiling and other parameters will be adjusted after some time of testing. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for UNIV2WBTCETH-A with smaller ilk.hole.

If the vote fails, this vault type will be onboarded with 5,000 DAI Dust instead.  Overview  Protocol Summary Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap v2 with few slight changes such as introduction of governance token and its tokenomics. At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. The main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-SUSHI-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of SUSHI and ether; currently it is the second largest pool by liquidity in the protocol, holding over $500M in assets, which means there is approximately $250M worth of each asset deposited. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be able to earn liquidity mining rewards; SLP-SUSHI-ETH receives the highest incentivization of any pair on Sushiswap.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-SUSHI-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-SUSHI-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. The SUSHI token has a fairly concentrated supply distribution, with over 20% of supply controlled in a 6 of 9 signature gnosis multisig. This has been accumulated from a 10% share of minted SUSHI tokens flowing to the dev fund, as well as tokens held on behalf of past LPs under manual 6 month vesting. Additionally, new tokens will be minted and distributed to liquidity providers gradually until the total SUSHI supply reaches a maximum supply of 250 million tokens.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-SUSHI-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP SUSHI-ETH tokens (98%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool. SUSHI is primarily traded on Sushiswap, but is also integrated with other protocols like Cream Lending.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of ETH stays stable, a decline in the price of SUSHI will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-SUSHI-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in SUSHI, and additional losses caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-SUSHI-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = SUSHI percentage price change * SUSHI allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + SUSHI percentage price change) / (2 + SUSHI percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * SUSHI percentage price change)) E.g. if SUSHI price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 SLP-SUSHI-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in SUSHI price leads to 29.3% drop in SLP-SUSHI-ETH value, assuming no change in ETH price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between SUSHI and SLP-SUSHI-ETH price performance is shown below. Note that this same effect applies to changes in the price of either pool asset, so declines in ETH price will also impact the value of SLP-SUSHI-ETH.  Chart1200\u00d7742 38.8 KB  Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH and SUSHI prices and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-SUSHI-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than SUSHI alone. The largest price drawdown would have been 41%, experienced on 19 May 2021 on the same day when SUSHI price fell 48% (and ETH price fell 31%).  Source: Coinmarketcap, June 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 15.81%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-SUSHI-ETH was ~33%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 66.7 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, June 2021  Summary of Notable Risks   SLP-SUSHI-ETH is exposed to Sushiswap governance and custody risk. A large portion of SUSHi tokens are held in a 6 of 9 multisig, and unexpected distribution or hacks could cause the value of the LP to drop significantly. Multisig signers are well known/respected individuals so the risk of intentional malicious actions is considered low.   Sushiswap may face significant challenges from Uniswap v3. If it\u2019s unable to maintain market share, this will negatively impact SUSHI token and LP value and reduce the pool of capital able to borrow through this vault type.   SLP-SUSHI-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when SUSHI or ETH experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during large relative price moves, which may outpace LP earnings. This could have a negative impact on SUSHI token liquidity which would place other liquidations at higher risk.   Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is the primary pair so it is likely to remain favored.   The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.

Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues While xSUSHI has limited direct trading volumes, it can be exchanged freely for underlying SUSHI tokens via the Sushibar staking contract. This means any SUSHI trading volumes and exchange integrations add to xSUSHI\u2019s overall liquidity as well. SUSHI has gained the most volume against assets such as USDT, WETH, and BTC. The exchanges that have accrued the most trading volume are CEXs such as: Binance, Huobi, Coinbase and FTX.

The reason why most SUSHI volume on DEXs happen on Sushiswap is due to high liquidity incentives associated with the SUSHI token on the Sushiswap platform. DEX trading volume for SUSHI:   1014\u00d7888 151 KB   Source of data: Block Analitica We see a similar trend with respect to AMM liquidity for the SUSHI token on different DEXs. The vast majority of liquidity for SUSHI can be found on Sushiswap, compared to Uniswap and other decentralised exchanges. This is also due to the liquidity incentives for the SUSHI token on the Sushiswap platform.

The rate of token emissions will steadily decline as token supply approaches the maximum cap of 250 million SUSHI. The current circulating supply is 172 million SUSHI. The Sushiswap multisig receives 10% of all SUSHI tokens minted for liquidity incentives, and over time this has built up to a reserve of ~20 million SUSHI tokens. These can be used or sold at the discretion of governance to fund development or other priorities. The multisig also controls another ~30 million SUSHI that is being held in reserve for previously approved vesting of liquidity incentives. These are scheduled to be released to past liquidity providers over the next 5 months via a manual vesting mechanism.  921\u00d7346 53.2 KB  Source: SUSHI Etherscan  909\u00d7364 49.4 KB  Source: xSUSHI Etherscan The chart below shows the emissions schedule from launch out through year 4, when substantially all of the supply will have been distributed.  695\u00d7437 10.6 KB  Source: Messari  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure Most centralized exchange platforms offer trading in SUSHI tokens rather than xSUSHI, but we can consider these to be equivalent as SUSHI can be wrapped or unwrapped to xSUSHI on demand. Centralized exchanges offering SUSHI trading include Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini plus many others. SUSHI and xSUSHI tokens are offered on most decentralized exchanges as well, but due to high liquidity incentives the overwhelming majority of DEX liquidity is on Sushiswap itself. xSUSHI is integrated with several other defi platforms, including lending and borrowing via Aave, Cream Finance and Unit Protocol. Aave in particular has seen high usage of xSUSHI, with over $150 million in xSUSHI deposited as collateral currently. Approximately 84% of circulating supply of SUSHI tokens are held on exchanges. The amount of SUSHI on SushiSwap represents 79% of the total circulating supply. This is primarily due to SUSHI being the native token of the SushiSwap platform.

Note that this period covers only since late August, and SUSHI\u2019s performance during a more severe drawdown on the scale of March 12 2020 is still untested.  Chart1200\u00d7742 12 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns xSUSHI stakers receive earnings from the 0.05% protocol portion of swap fees. These earnings can act as a price support for xSUSHI token price, as trading volumes (and therefore xSUSHI earnings) will tend to increase during periods of high volatility when SUSHI token price could otherwise be falling. The chart below shows the total funds staked in xSUSHI versus Sushiswap trade volume and annualized staking yield. Generally it has trended between 5-10% APY, with a brief spike to ~30% during the May downturn.  Chart1200\u00d7742 55.3 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision / Coingecko, June 2021  Risk Premium to Debt Exposure  770\u00d7450 21.8 KB  Source: MakerDAO Risk Dashboard | Block Analitica  Summary of Notable Risks  Governance risk: Because Sushiswap uses off chain signal voting implemented through a multisig, SUSHI/xSUSHI lack direct control over protocol cashflows, operations, or treasury reserves. The multisig requires agreement from 6 of 9 signers (all well known individuals) to execute transactions so governance risk is considered low, but potentially higher than other supported defi protocols. xSUSHI (and SUSHI) token value depends on Sushiswap exchange performance. Competition with Uniswap, Curve and others may impact Sushiswap\u2019s market share and token price. Sushiswap currently pays out 100% of fee earnings to xSUSHI staking, but this amount could be reduced by governance. Lower yield could make xSUSHI less economical for vault users. SUSHI token liquidity is heavily incentivized on Sushiswap, and any reductions in incentives (considered unlikely) would reduce assets available for liquidations and potentially increase volatility. A large share of the SUSHI token supply (including xSUSHI) is supplied as collateral to lending markets such as Unit protocol and Aave. This increases risk of sharp falls due to liquidation cascades. Smart contract risk: Staking SUSHI in the SushiBar smart contract can lead to loss of funds in the event of a smart contract bug, malicious attack, or exploit. Volatility risk: Because of the way staking rewards are generated in Sushibar, the price of xSUSHI will always be a function of the SUSHI price. Hence, high price volatility of SUSHI will lead to high volatility in xSUSHI.

Lido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user\u2019s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When transactions are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards. The stETH token is a liquid alternative for the staked ether: it could be transferred, traded, or used in DeFi applications. stETH is very good collateral for people who are long Ethereum, as it lets them at once margin long ETH and compounds it with staking rewards. Staking rewards alone can pay off stability fee if it\u2019s sufficiently low. stETH is a rebasable token and integration of this asset requires a custom Gem Join contract. An easier and less risky way is to integrate wstETH, a trustless fixed-balance wrapper (wstETH | Lido Docs), and use the standard Gem Join contract.  Governance Lido DAO governs a set of liquid staking protocols with Lido on Ethereum among them. The Lido DAO decides on Lido\u2019s key parameters (e.g., fees) and executes Lido upgrades. The Lido DAO members govern Lido to ensure its efficiency and stability. To have a vote in the Lido DAO, one must hold its governance token, LDO. LDO voting weight is proportional to the amount of LDO a voter stakes in the voting contract. The more LDO locked in a user\u2019s voting contract, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets. The exact mechanism of LDO voting can be upgraded just like the other DAO applications.  Founding and Funding Lido launched in December 2020. The Lido DAO consists of, amongst others, Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Terra, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix. The Lido treasury has been recently diversified and DAO members now include Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Jump Trading, Alameda Research, iFinex, Dragonfly Capital, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, The LAO and angels. The stETH token is a tokenized version of staked ether. When a user sends ether into the Lido liquid staking smart contract, the user receives the corresponding amount of stETH tokens. The stETH token represents Lido user\u2019s deposits and the corresponding staking rewards and slashing penalties. The protocol applies a 10% fee (this can be changed by the DAO) on staking rewards that are split between node operators, the DAO, and a slashing insurance fund.  Metrics and Analysis stETH has been steadily growing in circulation supply since its inception on December 19th, 2020 and currently stands at 456,449 stETH ($1.29B). The issuance of stETH can be tracked using the chart below:  1189\u00d7349 14.8 KB  Source: Nansen  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues stETH is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges including Curve, 1Inch, Uniswap and SushiSwap.

Explore and share data from Ethereum Mainnet, Matic, Optimism and xDai for free.      The absolute majority of trading volume (around 96%) is on Curve. stETH trading volume is small compared to available stETH\u2019s liquidity, and is not indicative of it (see below and article https://blog.lido.fi/concerning-steth-liquidity/) It should be noticed that trading volume of the pool does not include the amount of ETH and stETH has being sold while adding/removing liquidity in order to keep the pool balanced as the pool\u2019s protocol implies adding and removing ETH/stETH pair in the proportion reflecting the pool balance and performing exchanges for the unbalanced part. For example, during last month pool\u2019s addings and withdrawals brought $43m daily and total daily trading volume was $49.5m (8 times higher compared to $6.2m only exchanges volume).   Token Ownership Distribution The current stETH supply stands at 456,449 stETH tokens ( worth $1.294 billion) in circulation between 7,172 unique holders for an average of 63.64 stETH per holder. The supply of stETH tracks the number of ETH deposited into the Lido contract. The total supply of stETH can be tracked via the token contract address.

In addition, steCRV tokens can be staked for additional CRV and LDO rewards.  750\u00d7467 30.4 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, calculation  Defi Presence / Integrations The stETH:ETH pair is the biggest pool on Curve with over $1.76b in liquidity, which makes stETH one of the most liquid tokens in crypto. You need to trade 175000 ETH to stETH or vice versa (more than $200m) to move the price 2%. The reason for that is that the pool is incentivized. There are CRV rewards and LDO rewards that people who are providing liquidity for a stETH:ETH pool can receive by staking their LP shares in the Curve gauge. Lido is incentivizing the pool by monthly governance decisions: e.g. this month 0.375% of total LDO supply, which amounts to $9m or over 3500 ETH at the time of writing, was allocated to the gauge. stETH is very good collateral for people who are long Ethereum, as it lets them at once margin long ETH and compounds it with staking rewards. Staking rewards alone can pay off stability fee if it\u2019s sufficiently low. Drawbacks:  The absolute majority of liquidity (76%) and trading volume (96%) is allocated on Curve.fi so the existing price feed relies on one liquidity pool. stETH is a rebaseable token that requires a custom GemJoin contract for integration. wstETH is a trustless fixed-balance wrapper that is easier and less risky to integrate (using the standard GemJoin contract).

Three lowest drops took place on May (19th, 12st, 23d) due to overall market conditions.  Source: Coinmarketcap, calculation Despite that stETH token is still quite novel and there is no such vast historical data compared to ETH, stETH holds the ETH peg 1:1 (at the latest crypto drop peg dropped to 0.99 only). The lowest drop in price in comparison to ETH was on 24th March (0.95764). Normalized daily volatility (stETH to ETH) varies from 0.95% (30d) to 1.77% (90d).  1570\u00d7594 68.9 KB     dune.xyz    Dune Analytics Ethereum Ecosystem analytics by and for the community.

Normalized daily volatility (stETH to ETH):  1354\u00d7258 11.6 KB  Source: Coingecko, calculation Despite relatively low historical volatility, there is some risk of a larger price discount developing. Because it is not possible to redeem stETH for ETH until the merge upgrade (expected in 2022), users must rely on market liquidity to get back from stETH to ETH. Currently there is very deep liquidity in the Curve stETH/ETH pool supported by ongoing LDO and CRV incentives. A decrease in overall stETH liquidity incentives would lead to less depth and greater slippage for sales, so this is partly dependent on Lido DAO governance decisions to continue incentives. As stETH gets accepted at more lending platforms (there are also applications pending with Compound and Aave, and a lending pool on Rari Capital Fuse), there\u2019s a higher likelihood of forced selling (due to liquidations) which could cause the price to trade at a discount. We can use implied yield to maturity as a simple heuristic to understand how large the discount could get due to short term selling impacts. The ETH2 merge is expected in 2022, leaving roughly a year until users will be able to redeem their stETH for ETH. Any price discount implies additional yield to maturity. If the price were to trade at a 5% discount to full value for example, buyers would earn an additional 5.26% yield. This can be generalized as: supplemental yield = (1 / ( 1 - discount) ) ^ expected time to maturity If we assume a 25% yield will be more than enough to activate buyers in even the most stressed market conditions, the price discount shouldn\u2019t exceed 20% per year until the expected maturity date. In practice this means risk of price discount should decrease over time as the expected merge date draws closer, but is also impacted by any unexpected development delays.  Volatility The data details the hourly volatility of stETH over 90 days and all period passed since the token was launched (~6months) scaled up the data to a yearly volatility.  1348\u00d7194 9 KB  The same indicators for the pair stETH:ETH indicate the low volatility toward ETH.  Risk Premium to Debt Exposure  988\u00d7523 27.8 KB   Summary of Notable Risks  Smart contract/technical risks: Lido faces smart contract risks. To mitigate these, Lido has been audited multiple times - by Quantstamp, Sigma Prime, and MixBytes (see Audits), with no critical issues found. Counterparty risks: Lido is a DAO. Decisions in the Lido DAO are made through proposals and votes - community members manage protocol parameters, node operators, oracle members, and more. The Lido staking infrastructure for stETH consists of 9 node operators, with a focus on decentralization. Lido relies on a set of oracles to report staking rewards to the smart contracts. Their maximum possible impact is limited by the recent upgrade (limit oracles report change by 10% APR increase in stake and 5% decrease in stake), and the operators of oracles are all well-known entities: Stakefish, Certus One, Chorus, Staking Facilities, and P2P. Read further in Lido documentation. Staking risks: stETH faces staking risks, specifically validator risks including slashing and hostage risks. To mitigate these, Lido works only with best-in-class validators with a track record of success. In addition to this, staked ETH with Lido is protected from slashing using the Unslashed Finance insurance protocol. At the time of writing, Lido is covered for ~20000 ETH slashing until June 22nd. To date, no slashings have been incurred. Withdrawal risks: To mitigate withdrawal risks, Lido staking went live on December 18th through a withdrawal key ceremony. Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi), and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido\u2019s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. Lido plans to move over to a fully non-custodial solution in the near future. Price feed risk: stETH is not traded on CEXs yet and thus the oracle has to use the Curve pool price and ETH price feed to determine the current price. Liquidity Risk: Until Eth2 merge upgrade takes place (expected in 2022), it will not be possible to redeem stETH for ETH. This creates potential for price discounts on stETH if many users want to sell at once. Lending protocol liquidations could increase this risk as large quantities of stETH may be sold all at once to satisfy a debt. The risk of price discounts decreases as expected ETH2 merge gets closer.   Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 160% Debt Ceiling: 5m DC-IAM gap: 3m DC-IAM ttl: 8h Cut: 0.99 Step: 90 seconds Buf: 1.30 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 140 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 3m DAI Dust: 10.000 DAI We propose a relatively low initial debt ceiling to limit risk from the new Curve oracle, with the expectation of raising this in the near future through the parameter proposal group process. This limits risk from use of a new oracle type. stETH inherits all of ETH\u2019s market risk factors so it is appropriate to set stETH stability fee at least as high as a corresponding ETH vault. The stability fee rate can also be adjusted through the parameter proposal group process to mirror changes in the ETH-A vault stability fee. The initial proposed liquidation ratio is somewhat higher than the ETH-A vault, which is intended to allow for competitively low stability fees even if Maker gains large lending exposure. The liquidation ratio can be lowered to match ETH-A in the future based on liquidity conditions and usage. We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here.

Lido has temporarily stopped the ability of node operators to deposit additional ETH, which will prevent this issue from being exploited until a fix is in place. Unless smart contracts team has any opinions on the matter, I don\u2019t think this significantly changes the risk outlook for stETH. Node operators already have significant power within the system, including the ability to maliciously block withdrawals of roughly 1/2 of deposited ETH that was staked before Lido moved to smart contract withdrawal mechanism. Lido deals with this by screening node operators for reputation and track record, and diversifying deposits among many competing node operators. So while the newly disclosed issue represented an additional trust requirement on node operators, this is not fundamentally different from the existing risk posture. ",

Polygon will offer a generalised framework to allow the development of application-specific, Ethereum-compatible blockchains, that can use different scaling technologies, while still benefiting from interoperability. The first product from the Polygon Network to gain significant traction is the Polygon POS/Plasma hybrid chain, an EMV compatible scaling solution which provides both Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Plasma-enabled sidechains. MATIC is the native token of the Polygon Network. It is currently being used to contribute to the security of the Polygon PoS chain through staking, to pay for gas fees, or to participate in the Polygon Network governance. Matic Network was first founded in October 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun. In February 2021, the project was rebranded to Polygon Network. The rebrand also meant an expansion in mission and technology scope, focusing on becoming \u201cEthereum\u2019s Internet of Blockchains\u201d. The expansion would include: (i) more focus on other major scaling solutions, such as zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and Validium, (ii) inter-chain communication protocols, (iii) new data availability solutions, and more. The focus shifted to developing an ecosystem akin to Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche while benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s existing security, network effects, openness, and flexibility. The Polygon PoS chain currently has 100 validators. Validators and delegates stake MATIC by depositing the tokens into a staking contract deployed on Ethereum L1. In exchange, they earn rewards in MATIC. The Polygon PoS chain is referred to as a \u201ccommit-chain\u201d. This means that the chain periodically commits/checkpoints to Ethereum in order to achieve Ethereum based finality. This means that (i) the Polygon network relies on Ethereum security, and (ii) Polygon pays gas fees on Ethereum L1 to secure the staking contract and achieve checkpointing. To deposit funds from Ethereum to Polygon, users need to go through a bridge. Polygon currently offers two bridges that allow users to deposit funds into Polygon: the Plasma bridge, and the PoS bridge. In practice, when depositing funds to Polygon, users lock funds into a contract on Ethereum L1. The corresponding amount of tokens are then minted on Polygon as a pegged token (1:1). To withdraw funds, users need to go back through the bridge. This means that the funds on Polygon are burned, and the funds in the Ethereum L1 contract are unlocked, and can then be withdrawn. The withdrawal process currently takes between 1-3 hours on the PoS bridge, and 7 days on the Plasma bridge. The Plasma bridge inherits the security of Ethereum, while the PoS bridge is secured by the Polygon PoS chain validator set. It is worth noting that both the PoS/Plasma and Custom \u201cChild ERC20\u2019\u2019 contracts are currently upgradeable by multisigs that can be activated by 5/8 signers. The signers are the Polygon co-founders, and four other individuals with protected identities from projects: Curve Finance, Quickswap, Cometh, and Horizon Games. However, the Polygon team has stated that once the contracts have been battle-tested, they will explore moving from multisigs to governance-controlled proxies, introduce timelocks, and eventually completely remove multisigs.  On-chain fundamentals Addresses holding MATIC Since the announcement of the Polygon rebrand on February 9, 2021, Polygon Network and the MATIC token have seen rapid growth and adoption. For instance, the amount of unique addresses on Ethereum holding MATIC tokens has increased by approximately 453%, from circa 24,084 to 109,133 at the time of writing. Unique addresses holding MATIC  1250\u00d7480 23.8 KB  Source: Nansen Daily active addresses Starting in April 2021, the growth of daily active addresses rapidly accelerated. This coincided with the launch of Polygon\u2019s joint liquidity mining programmes with DeFi protocols Aave (April, 13) and Sushiswap (May, 6). The number of active addresses on the Polygon PoS chain is now approximately 139,000, a 120x increase from February 2021. At the time of writing, daily active addresses on Ethereum are circa 502,000, according to Etherscan. Polygon currently has 27.6% of Ethereum\u2019s daily active addresses.  Chart1200\u00d7742 18.6 KB  Source: Polygonscan Transactions on Polygon PoS chain Low transaction fees, compared to Ethereum L1, is a key benefit of the Polygon PoS chain. Transaction fees have remained relatively low, despite the large rise in users, with only a few sporadic surges in price. According to Polygon Gas Station, the average gas fee on June 16, 2021, was 0.00263 MATIC ($0.000929). Daily transactions have followed similar growth to daily active addresses, increasing by approximately 142x from February (64,457 transactions) to circa 9.17 million transactions by June 16 according to Polygonscan. Total Value Locked (TVL) The Polygon Network currently has over 350 dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and the DAO space. This has contributed to rapid growth in TVL, which is approximately $11 billion at the time of writing, a 12.7x increase from March 2021, according to Defi Llama.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & on-chain venues  Traditional CEX Trading Activity MATIC is actively traded on several centralised exchanges, including Binance, OKEx, Coinbase, and Huobi. Binance has significantly higher MATIC volume, compared to the other CEXs. For example, on May 19, the day MATIC experienced the highest volume throughout all exchanges (a total of $6.34 billion), Binance accounted for $5.36 billion (circa 84.5% of all volume). The second-largest exchange by volume, Coinbase, accounted for $349.11 million (circa 5.5% of all volume). At the time of writing, the total volume was $1.5 billion, while Binance accounted for $1.22 billion (81.3% of all volume) and Coinbase $50 million, (3.3% of all volume). Traditional CEX Trading Activity (per exchange)  Source: Block Analitica & CryptoCompare Most of MATIC\u2019s trading volume happens on BUSD, USDT, USD, and BTC trading pairs. Traditional CEX Trading Activity (per asset pair)  Source: Block Analitica & CryptoCompare  On-chain Trading Venues In general, trading volume on Uniswap is higher than on Sushiswap. For example, on May 19, 2021, both trading venues recorded all-time highs in trading volume. The volume on Uniswap reached $66 million, while Sushiswap reported circa $525,000. It is also worth noting that on-chain trading volume, compared to CEX trading volume, is relatively low. On-chain Trading Venues Trading Activity  Source: Block Analitica As illustrated in the chart below, liquidity is also greater on Uniswap compared to Sushiswap. On-chain Trading Venues Asset Deposit - Liquidity  Source: Block Analitica  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule Token Distribution The total token supply for MATIC is capped at 10 billion. The Foundation Contract, Vesting Contract, Marketing & Ecosystem fund, and Network Mining & Seeding fund account for circa 3.7 billion (37% of total supply) MATIC tokens. By excluding these tokens, the remaining circulating supply of MATIC equals approximately 6.3 billion. Additionally, approximately 1.6 billion MATIC is currently being staked to secure the Polygon PoS chain, according to Polygon Staking.  1600\u00d7609 121 KB  Source: MATIC Etherscan Polygon has raised capital through a private sale, through a Binance Launchpad Sale (IEO), and from Coinbase Ventures. Other MATIC tokens have been distributed to other investors, the team, advisors, network operations, foundation, and ecosystem. The initial token distribution is shown in the table below:  Source: Messari Issuance Schedule The chart below shows the issuance schedule from April 2019, and for the next 4 years. It shows that by May 2025, almost all the supply of MATIC tokens will have been distributed. The emission schedule suggests that after October 2022, MATIC tokens will only be distributed through staking rewards. According to Matic documentation, 12% (1.2 billion MATIC) of the total supply cap will be distributed over time to fund staking. This is to ensure sufficient staking activity early on before transaction fees eventually gain traction.  1600\u00d7754 93.5 KB  Source: Messari Liquidity mining In addition, Polygon has recently initiated liquidity mining incentives to attract new users. They have created joint liquidity mining programmes with other DeFi protocols, such as Aave and Sushiswap. For example, on April 13, a joint liquidity mining initiative with Aave was announced. Throughout April 14 to June 14, 0.5% (50 million MATIC) of the total MATIC supply was allocated to Aave Polygon markets to incentivise liquidity. Another 0.5% of the total supply of MATIC will be distributed between June 17, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022. Similar liquidity mining programmes have been initiated with other DeFi projects, where either Polygon offers MATIC incentives, DeFi protocols offer their native token or both. Other protocols Polygon is working with to incentivise liquidity includes: Curve, Sushiswap, and Hop Protocol. EIP-1559 on Polygon To remain compliant with the Ethereum network and tooling, Polygon intends to adopt London hard fork changes and updates. This includes adopting EIP-1559, which will split the transaction fee into a basefee and a priority fee (or tip). On Ethereum, the basefee will be burned for every transaction. Polygon has a fixed supply cap of 10 billion MATIC, while the Ethereum network adopts a more nuanced monetary policy of minimum necessary issuance. This means that if Polygon decides to burn MATIC tokens, planned payouts, such as checkpoint rewards, will have to be restructured. Prabal Banerjee, Researcher at Polygon, recently proposed that Polygon should not burn the basefee, but rather allocate the basefee to a new contract that eventually will be governed by a Polygon DAO. Once the contract and DAO are established, the community can decide if MATIC tokens should be burned. At the time of writing, this is still only a proposal. However, the London hard fork will likely have an effect on the monetary policy of MATIC tokens irrespective of community decisions.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues The chart below shows the distribution of MATIC deposits across top trading venues. Coinbase holds 4.2% out of the total supply cap of MATIC. This is a significant and disproportionate amount compared with the other top trading venues. Most tokens are held on centralised exchanges. For example, Uniswap is the leader among on-chain trading venues but is only number 14 in the top trading venue list of MATIC deposits. This gives rise to two key concerns: (i) risk of concentrated supply on Coinbase, and (ii) low on-chain liquidity that may negatively impact MATIC token accessibility. The amount of MATIC tokens held on the top 14 trading venues represents approximately 12.3% of the total circulating supply and circa 7.8% of the total supply cap of MATIC tokens.  1194\u00d7734 102 KB  Source: Nansen Token deposits on Polygon PoS Chain At the time of writing, approximately 658 million MATIC is locked in the Polygon Plasma Bridge contract. Quickswap, a DEX built on Polygon, has circa $86.5 million worth of Wrapped Matic (WMATIC) in liquidity. This equals approximately 72 million MATIC at current prices ($1.19). However, it is important to note that this liquidity is not equal to on-chain DEX liquidity on Ethereum L1. First, withdrawing tokens from Polygon applications to L1 may take several transactions, and second, the bridge withdrawal process takes longer than withdrawing tokens directly from DEXs running on L1.  Downside Risk The MATIC token has experienced both larger, and more frequent drawdowns compared to ETH. The period covered in the chart below is from May 1, 2019 to June 22, 2021 on the daily, and May 30, 2019 to June 22, 2021 on the hourly. Note that MATIC has experienced both one -60% drawdown and one -70% drawdown, while ETH\u2019s largest drawdown during the same period was -50%.

MATIC is the most volatile asset, while MANA is the second most volatile asset on the chart.  1126\u00d7450 79.1 KB  Source: Block Analitica & CryptoCompare  DeFi presence By being one of the first production ready scaling solutions on Ethereum, Polygon has been able to attract many users and capture value. The Polygon PoS chain is fully EVM compatible. This means that redeploying protocols and applications from Ethereum L1 is very efficient. Currently, 350+ dapps have been deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and the DAO space. Completely new projects, forks of L1 projects, and existing projects on L1, such as Aave and Sushiswap, have been deployed on Polygon. The current TVL of Polygon is approximately $11 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, it is not clear if Polygon will be able to protect its first-mover advantage once other scaling teams ship their products. Competition in the space is high, and within the next 6 months, scaling solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync will launch to the public. The arrival of new market participants might change the market share of the Ethereum scaling landscape. This change can only be quantified once relevant data is available. The use of MATIC in DeFi on Ethereum L1 is currently limited. However, some protocols built on top of Polygon accept MATIC as collateral, such as Aave\u2019s Polygon market. Furthermore, all applications making use of the Polygon need to pay transaction fees in MATIC. This means that the MATIC token is embedded in all DeFi activity built on top of the Polygon PoS chain.  Summary of Notable Risks  Centralisation risk: Currently, the PoS/Plasma and Custom \u201cChild ERC20\u201d contracts can be changed, and are controlled by a 5/8 signer multisig. The Polygon team has stated that they eventually will explore moving to governance-controlled proxies. However, no clear timeline has been given. Token concentration risk: 37% of total MATIC supply cap (circa 3.7 billion MATIC) is currently being held by the foundation contract, vesting contract, marketing & ecosystem fund, and network mining & seeding fund. Social consensus: According to Matic documentation, if there is a bug, hack, or exploit in the system, the most likely solution would be to restore the chain to an earlier state through social consensus. Trusting that social consensus will work well enough to mitigate these issues, without any real experience of the success of social consensus, is currently a non-quantifiable risk. In addition, restoring the chain to an earlier state will not help get stolen funds back if the bridge contracts that are deployed on Ethereum L1 are hacked or exploited. Monetary policy: The monetary policy for MATIC will change during the upcoming London hard fork. The Polygon community has yet to decide if the basefee for Polygon transactions will be burned, or sent to a Polygon DAO treasury. The effect that these options may have on MATIC\u2019s monetary policy is currently unclear. Downside risk: MATIC has experienced a -60% and -70% drawdown. In addition, MATIC has experienced more frequent drawdowns in ranges between -10% and -50% compared to ETH. The -70% drawdown was one of the largest short-term drops in crypto history. Hence, larger than usual jump severity of 40% for similar assets has been simulated in the risk model (-45% for base case). Volatility risk: The MATIC token has exhibited more volatility than any other collateral type currently used in Maker Vaults. Concentration of trading activity: At the time of writing, 81.3% of all MATIC trading volume occurred on Binance, which may suggest a single point of failure risk. In contrast, it should be noted that Coinbase holds by far the largest proportion of MATIC tokens (circa 423 million MATIC). Polygon PoS chain validators: The Polygon PoS validator set is currently 100. The Binance chain currently accounts for approximately 30% of all MATIC staked. The top six nodes on Polygon account for approximately 69.5% of all MATIC staked. This may represent a collusion risk. However, as long as 2/3 of the weighted stake of the validators is honest, the chain will progress accurately. If 2/3 of the weighted stake validators are not honest, a validator has the power to stop the progress of the chain, or reorder blocks. It should be noted that validators cannot change the state, or the user\u2019s asset balances. Competition risk: Scaling Ethereum is currently a very competitive space with many high quality teams working on several new technologies. Scaling solution providers such as Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and others have yet to release their final solutions to market. Hence, it is still unclear how the scaling landscape will evolve and grow. It is possible that another scaling solution may emerge as a dominant player. If that is the case, Polygon risks losing market share and users.   Risk Premium Curve Since the MATIC token has demonstrated considerably higher volatility compared to other collateral types, higher severity of jumps (-45% for base case) has been applied to the simulations. A liquidation ratio of 175% is proposed for the MATIC token. This is similar to other more volatile collateral types.  1033\u00d7507 31.2 KB  Source: Block Analitica  Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 10m DC-IAM gap: 3m DC-IAM ttl: 8h Cut: 0.99 Step: 90 seconds Buf: 1.30 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 140 minutes Chip: 0.1 Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 3m DAI Dust: 10.000 DAI A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here.

Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. Uniswap v3 brings some marked changes to the system\u2019s design. It offers several fee tiers ranging from 0.05% to 1% per swap, with smaller fees being optimized for stable value assets to encourage greater trading volume. It also allows users to provide liquidity within a concentrated price range, which improves capital efficiency (particularly for stablecoin pairs where liquidity can be concentrated close to 1:1 ratio). This gives users a greater share of fees and improves liquidity for traders, but also increases risk of divergence / impermanent loss. Uniswap governance has control over fees in v3, and can take up to 25% of LP fee earnings to the protocol in the future. Currently protocol fees are turned off and all swap fees go to LPs. Unlike in Uniswap v2, LP shares are created as non fungible tokens (NFTs) and do not automatically reinvest fee earnings. G-UNI-DAI-USDC is a fungible strategy token that represents deposits into the Uniswap v3 DAI-USDC 0.05% fee pool between the 0.9994 and 1.0014 DAI/USDC price ranges. Fee earnings are reinvested into the pool via the Gelato network, a system of keepers that provides automation services while limiting risk of frontrunning and other abuses. 1% of reinvested earnings are withheld by Gelato as a protocol fee.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) G-UNI LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. G-UNI is not traded directly on any markets, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule G-UNI supply increases and decreases to correspond to user deposits and redemption. There are no inflationary supply factors, and total supply is based purely on user deposits.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure G-UNI-DAI-USDC is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. G-UNI-DAI-USDC is not presently integrated with any defi platforms or lending services.  Downside Risk Because G-UNI LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. Instead, we\u2019ll look at the constituent assets and price curve to determine downside risks. G-UNI-DAI-USDC is made up of USDC and DAI. Unlike in Uniswap v2, where liquidity is provided across the entire range of possible prices, this G-UNI strategy concentrates liquidity between 0.9994 and 1.0014 DAI/USDC price. If USDC falls to a price of 0.9986 or below the LP pool will be held 100% in USDC. This means G-UNI-DAI-USDC experiences essentially all of the downside price risk of USDC. Historically USDC has traded with very low volatility, which means historical downside volatility is a poor measure of risk in this case. Reasons USDC could decline in value include insolvency of the issuer Centre, default on their reserve investments, interruption of creation/redemption for fiat, or seizure of the reserves through legal or regulatory action \u2013 all of these represent more of tail risks rather than ordinary market risk. G-UNI-DAI-USDC price change = min(USDC percent change, DAI percent change) E.g. if USDC price suffers a 20% percentage drop in value, the G-UNI strategy suffers a roughly equivalent loss.  Chart1200\u00d7742 47.2 KB  With a proposed liquidation ratio of 105%, this allows for a roughly 5% drawdown in the price of USDC before Maker begins to experience losses on the exposure. This is a significantly larger buffer versus existing USDC based vaults including the PSM and USDC-A, which both allow for 1% or less price drawdown in USDC.  Historical Fee Returns Uniswap v3 allows liquidity providers to charge a fee of either 1%, 0.3%, or 0.05% per swap. The G-UNI-DAI-USDC pool features a 0.05% swap fee. While fees are not automatically reinvested in Uniswap v3, the Gelato Network uses a system of incentivized keepers to reinvest funds on behalf of LPs, in exchange for a 1% cut of fee earnings. As both USDC and DAI track 1 USD, LPs in the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC pool bear low risk of divergence loss or other price risk. While fee returns have fluctuated widely, they have generally ranged between 2-10% APY. The chart below shows annualized fee returns based on trailing 7 day average trading volume and liquidity, with a few caveats. 50% of the G-UNI-DAI-USDC LP is held in the 0.9994-1.0004 range, while the price has been within this range well under 50% of the time; this leads to an overstatement of returns as the G-UNI LP has less targeted liquidity than the pool overall (where roughly 70% of TLV is held in the 1.0004-1.0014 range). In a worst case scenario where all trading takes place within the 1.0004-1.0014 range, the G-UNI LP would earn roughly 70% of the rate of return listed in the chart below.  Chart1328\u00d7742 65.6 KB  Source: Uniswap.info, July 2021 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, between 10% to 25% of each swap (value decided by governance) would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap. This would leave the remaining 0.0.0375% to 0.045% swap fee for G-UNI LPs, reducing annualized earnings by up to 25% versus the existing status.  Centralization and Custody Risks USDC is issued by Centre, a consortium consisting of Coinbase and Circle that is subject to US and global financial regulations. Centre has the ability to freeze or blacklist addresses due to court orders or other legal requirements. If Centre froze balances in the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC pool, due to the way Uniswap is designed all funds (USDC and DAI) in the pool would be unrecoverable until the freeze had been lifted. This could substantially impair the value of UNI-V2-DAI-USDC, due to inability to redeem tokens for underlying assets. On the other hand, Centre cannot differentiate between funds held in a single address, so the decision to freeze the Uniswap pool would impact all pool depositors. This results in somewhat lower risk of blacklisting or freezing versus USDC vaults or PSM, where censorship action could be directly targeted at MakerDAO. USDC is held in investments approved by Circle, including US bank accounts, US government debt, and corporate debt, and is audited periodically. The risk of credit losses or default on USDC is considered low. However, USDC holders would be exposed to any potential losses in underlying fiat funds. Additionally, if redemption activity was curtailed due to operational or regulatory reasons, the price of USDC could trade below $1 even while remaining fully collateralized. Gelato Network runs the automation bots that allow for reinvestment of fee earnings into the G-UNI LP. They have committed to removing key admin powers before integration with MakerDAO, so the risk of loss of principal from Gelato network custody practices should be eliminated. But it could be possible for bots participating in the network to front run or otherwise exploit the fee reinvestment transactions - this is considered unlikely as malicious action could be spotted and the offending party removed from the network with minimal profit opportunity. This issue would only affect recent fee earnings before reinvestment, so the impact to Maker and vault users would be low.  LP Behavior During Emergency Shutdown The Maker protocol includes the ability to shut down the system during emergencies through a global settlement process. When this happens, each DAI becomes redeemable for $1 of underlying collateral. But as soon as shutdown is triggered, fluctuating prices of the basket of collateral assets will begin to push DAI\u2019s redemption value above or below $1 (this price drift can happen even during the 6 hour shutdown period before DAI becomes redeemable for collateral). Concentrated DAI-stablecoin liquidity (including G-UNI-DAI-USDC) as collateral introduces asymmetric downside risk to DAI collateral value in these circumstances. To give a concrete example, let\u2019s imagine a hypothetical collateral portfolio of 100 DAI backed 50% by ETH and 50% by G-UNI-DAI-USDC. When global settlement is triggered, each DAI will be backed by $0.50 of ETH and $0.50 of G-UNI-DAI-USDC. If the price of ETH falls 50%, initially each DAI would be backed by $0.75 of collateral ($0.25 of ETH and $0.50 of G-UNI-DAI-USDC). But because DAI would now be trading at a discount, all of the USDC liquidity in the G-UNI LP will be drained for DAI, leaving each DAI backed by $0.25 of ETH and 0.5 DAI - through redemption, this will yield $0.5 ETH for each circulating DAI token.  Chart1200\u00d7742 62.2 KB  G-UNI-DAI-USDC experiences essentially all of the downside exposure of the rest of the DAI collateral portfolio. On the other hand, the upside of G-UNI collateral is capped at $1 because any rises in DAI price above that threshold would lead to all of the G-UNI LP being held in USDC.  Summary of Notable Risks  Technical risk: Uniswap v3 was released within the past few months, and has a relatively short history compared with other decentralized exchange platforms. The G-UNI implementation is also new and relatively untested. Undiscovered technical issues could potentially cause loss of funds. Collateral that includes DAI such as G-UNI-DAI-USDC could increase potential losses for DAI holders if emergency shutdown occurred while there was bad debt (negative DAI surplus). If Maker took action that reduced the collateral backing of DAI below $1 (eg. negative interest rates), this may also lead to increased DAI holder losses in an emergency shutdown event. Even in cases where there was no bad debt during an emergency shutdown, significant amounts of G-UNI-DAI-USDC collateral could lead to lower DAI redemption value depending on the performance of other volatile assets within the portfolio. G-UNI-DAI-USDC is fully exposed to the downside risk of USDC, so a price discount caused by credit losses or lack of confidence could lead to under collateralized debt and losses to Maker. If the UNI-V3-DAI-USDC pool were frozen by the USDC issuers, all funds locked in the pool (DAI and USDC) would be unrecoverable until the freeze is lifted. USDC\u2019s freeze and burn functionality makes this asset vulnerable to censorship or legal/regulatory pressure. Uniswap governance can turn on a platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against G-UNI-DAI-USDC. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Curve and Sushiswap compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs (and by extension would reduce borrowing demand from Maker). This could force Maker to charge lower stability fees.   Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 1% Liquidation Ratio: 105% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI DC-IAM gap: 10 million DAI DC-IAM ttl: 8 hours Cut: 0.999 Step: 120 seconds Buf: 1.05 Cusp: 0.9 Tail: 220 minutes Chip: 0.10% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.95 Ilk.hole: 5 million DAI Dust: 10,000 DAI As with other stablecoin assets, liquidations will be deactivated for this collateral type. Because the risk of G-UNI-DAI-USDC is primarily from USDC tail risks (centralization, custody, and credit risk), it is not possible to generate appropriate risk parameters from previous price volatility and liquidity data. We have adapted the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide process to suit this stablecoin collateral type. Risk parameters were selected based on expected risk of USDC exposure, with additional buffers to accommodate the relatively new implementation of G-UNI and Uniswap v3, along with the idiosyncratic price risks associated with concentrated v3 liquidity. Similar to existing USDC vault types, liquidations will be disabled for G-UNI-DAI-USDC, and the protocol will assume constant prices of $1 for both DAI and USDC.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters   Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 165% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.99 Step: 130 seconds Buf: 1.3 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 200 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI  Overview  Protocol Summary Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap v2 with few slight changes such as introduction of governance token and its tokenomics. At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-YFI-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of YFI and ether; currently it is one of the largest pools by liquidity in the protocol, holding $209M in assets, which means there is approximately $104.5M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently the largest YFI on-chain market. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-YFI-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-YFI-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-YFI-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP YFI-ETH tokens (99.52%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or YFI will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-YFI-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-YFI-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + YFIUSD percentage price change * YFI allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETHYFI percentage price change) / (2 + ETHYFI percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETHYFI percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% price drop while YFI suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 SLP-YFI-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in ETH price and 30% drop in YFI price leads to 41.2% drop in SLP-YFI-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between YFI or ETH price changes and SLP-YFI-ETH price performance is shown below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 39.4 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021 Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH, YFI price and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-YFI-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than underlying assets. The largest price drawdown would have been -39.7%, experienced on 19 May 2021 on the same day when ETH price fell 31.7% based on close prices. Only the duration of SLP-YFI-ETH existence was taken into account for asset drops and close price returns were considered for this analysis.  Chart1200\u00d7742 8.22 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 18.51%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-YFI-ETH was ~19.32%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 64.4 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, May 2021  Summary of Notable Risks  This collateral type is exposed to specific YFI related risks and with addition of SLP-YFI-ETH collateral we are increasing our exposure towards these specific risks. SLP-YFI-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when ETH and YFI experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would lower liquidity on the market which can increase slippage for YFI. Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is a major pair so it is likely to remain. The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.   Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 165% Debt Ceiling: 1 million DAI Cut: 0.99 Step: 130 seconds Buf: 1.3 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 200 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 1m DAI Dust: 5000 DAI We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here. In instance of SLP-YFI-ETH we do not have an equal Uniswap LP token currently present in the system, nevertheless, we believe the volatile/volatile combination is still very similarly to other LP tokens such as UNIV2LINKETH, we propose a similar set of initial parameters with an additional premium on current stability fee of 1 percentage point as we currently already have exposure towards YFI and as additional liquidity mining rewards offer higher expected returns for users and potentially more risk as there are additional complexities related to vaults collecting rewards. We usually recommend initiating a new collateral with a small debt ceiling, Uniswap LPs were initiated at 3m dai, but in this case we are introducing a new vault functionalities so we recommend even lower initial debt ceiling at 1m dai. Same recommendation was also made by other mandated actors such as the Oracles and Protocol Engineering team. The debt ceiling and other parameters will be adjusted after some time of testing. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for UNIV2LINKETH-A with smaller ilk.hole.

At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-LINK-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of LINK and ether; currently it is one of the largest pools by liquidity in the protocol, holding $105M in assets, which means there is approximately $102.5M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently one of the largest LINK on-chain markets. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-LINK-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-LINK-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-LINK-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP LINK-ETH tokens (99.24%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or LINK will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-LINK-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-LINK-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + LINKUSD percentage price change * LINK allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETHLINK percentage price change) / (2 + ETHLINK percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETHLINK percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% price drop while LINK suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 SLP-LINK-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in ETH price and 30% drop in LINK price leads to 41.2% drop in SLP-LINK-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between LINK or ETH price changes and SLP-LINK-ETH price performance is shown below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 40.9 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021 Sushiswap has only been live since late August 2020, but based on the historical ETH, LINK price and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, SLP-LINK-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than underlying assets. The largest price drawdown would have been -40%, experienced on 19 May 2021 on the same day when ETH price fell 31.7% based on close prices. Only the duration of SLP-LINK-ETH existence was taken into account for asset drops and close price returns were considered for this analysis.  Chart1200\u00d7742 8.76 KB  Source: Coinmarketcap, May 2021  Historical Fee Returns Sushiswap liquidity pools earn a 0.25% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of impermanent loss. In addition, SLP token can be staked for additional SUSHI rewards, which are not equalized between pools and can also change over time based on what kind of liquidity and users protocol wish to attract more. Average daily annualized fee earnings for SLPs were 9.59%. In addition, SLP collateral will be earning SUSHI rewards, which substantially increase their expected return. The return of SUSHI rewards is based on several factors, such as liquidity mining reward allocation to the pool, amount of capital in the pool, price of SUSHI and thus fluctuates; at the time of writing, annualized SUSHI reward for SLP-LINK-ETH was ~20.87%.  Chart1200\u00d7742 64.3 KB  Source: Sushiswap.vision, May 2021  Summary of Notable Risks  This collateral type is exposed to specific LINK related risks and with addition of SLP-LINK-ETH collateral we are increasing our exposure towards these specific risks. SLP-LINK-ETH will suffer from impermanent loss when ETH and LINK experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would lower liquidity on the market which can increase slippage for LINK. Sushiswap governance can change SUSHI liquidity mining reward allocation, but this is a major pair so it is likely to remain. The SLP collateral will be farming SUSHI rewards which is a novel type of vault due to additional functionality and present an additional smart contract risk.

As this collateral asset behaves very similarly to UNIV2LINKETH we propose a similar set of initial parameters with an additional premium on current stability fee of 1 percentage point as additional liquidity mining rewards offer higher expected returns for users and potentially more risk as there are additional complexities related to vaults collecting rewards. We usually recommend initiating a new collateral with a small debt ceiling, Uniswap LPs were initiated at 3m dai, but in this case we are introducing a new vault functionalities so we recommend even lower initial debt ceiling at 1m dai. Same recommendation was also made by other mandated actors such as the Oracles and Protocol Engineering team. The debt ceiling and other parameters will be adjusted after some time of testing.

At the time - late August 2020, Uniswap did not have a governance token which could be rewarded for \u201cliquidity mining\u201d and incentivisation of protocol usage; this instance enabled opportunity for \u201cvampire mining\u201d, which aimed to shift current asset liquidity used in Uniswap to the Sushiswap - the event was seen as greatly successful. Initial main developer known as Chef Nomi pulled a \u201crug pull\u201d on the community where he withdrawn his SUSHI/ETH liquidity and cashing it out for ether; the situation was later resolved with the help of Sam Bankman-Fried who managed to return the protocol to the community, via establishing a multi-sig with well-known crypto community individuals as signers, Chef Nomi also returned the funds to the projects treasury. Sushiswap as fork of Uniswap is using the same automated market maker (AMM) methodology with the x*y=k formula to quote prices. The model relies on market depth being constructed from the pooled liquidity and market agents making swaps with it, where price slippage is relevant to the swap order size and the size of the pooled liquidity. Liquidity providers known as LPs are earning trading fees and are subject to \u201cliquidity mining\u201d rewards from the protocol, but are exposed to \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d which is loss which can occur after the pooled assets fluctuate in price relative to the value of asset if they would not be deployed into the pool at all. In general, the accrued fees in combination with liquidity rewards often completely offset the impermanent loss. Main difference between the two protocols is that Sushiswap distributed accrued protocol revenue from 0.3% protocol trading fees between LPs (0.25%) and xSUSHI token holders (0.05%). xSUSHI is received after depositing SUSHI into a pool called SushiBar; a way to distribute a portion of accrued revenue to token holders. In addition Sushiswap is continuously rewarding LPs with a liquidity mining program, where in addition to collected trading fees, suppliers are rewarded with the protocol token SUSHI. Sushiswap governance works via voting, where votes are in the form of SushiPowah, which is a voting metric and works as followed; each SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth 2 SushiPowah and each SUSHI held via xSUSHI is worth 1 SushiPowah. Votes are managed on snapshot.page, quorum of at least 5 million SushiPowah is required and the multisig signers mentioned previously implement the changes into the protocol. SLP-AAVE-ETH is the Sushiswap LP (SLP) token consisting of AAVE and ether; currently it is one of the largest pools by liquidity in the protocol, holding $137M in assets, which means there is approximately $68.5M worth of both assets deposited. This is currently one of the largest AAVE on-chain markets. One important difference between how Sushiswap LPs will be implemented into MCD compared to Uniswap LPs is that prior will be using the CropJoin Adapter (SushiJoin), meaning that SLP collateral will be subject to liquidity mining rewards; SLP positions will achieve higher expected return compared to Uniswap LPs.  Metrics and Analysis  Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues Sushiswap LP tokens (SLP) can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the SLP-AAVE-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. An important thing to note is that due to the pricing mechanism used by AMM based venues, the real asset weights in the pool do not always reflect the target weight (in this case 50:50), which means that Keepers must take this into account when redeeming the underlying assets.  Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule SLP-AAVE-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Sushiswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply.  Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure SLP-AAVE-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Vast majority of SLP AAVE-ETH tokens (99.29%) are deposited into Sushiswap\u2019s incentivized SUSHI farming pool - MasterChef Staking Pool.  Downside Risk Because Sushiswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, the invariant function (y*x=k) allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or AAVE will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of SLP-AAVE-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d. SLP-AAVE-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + impermanent loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + AAVEUSD percentage price change * AAVE allocation (50%) Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETHAAVE percentage price change) / (2 + ETHAAVE percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETHAAVE percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% price drop while AAVE suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Impermanent loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 SLP-AAVE-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in ETH price and 30% drop in AAVE price leads to 41.2% drop in SLP-AAVE-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between AAVE or ETH price changes and SLP-AAVE-ETH price performance is shown below.
