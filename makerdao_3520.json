I was thinking about something with a bit more digestible info for people who are new here.   As I scan the documents scattered about I find pieces of what I was looking for.   While we can introduce ourselves to each other I think it would be nice maybe to write an \u2018Introduction to MakerDAO\u2019 which gives a kind of ELI5 summary and then links to deeper topics maybe. I\u2019m still mulling this over as I read the documentation as I find it and am making notes but finding this to be a torturous process.   I may try to work on a draft but I feel like I really would need to pick someones brain that really understands this stuff to accelerate such a project. Also not noted in my introduction.  I have a new family (6mo old baby and 4 yr old and disabled wife with a medical condition) full time work etc. so on occasion if I disappear for a few days or a week - be understanding as there are a lot of people depending on me at this point and I still have a full time job.   Would rather have another better job, but I can\u2019t imagine too many being able to match my current pay and bonus package along with the flex time.  I probably will post here about what should be in such a thread - than posting in the welcome thread itself as it doesn\u2019t seem right to clutter that up with what \u2018should\u2019 be in the thread vs. just putting it there after others vet the info\u2026 ",

I have to caveat this as I did not do a systematic paw around for more days.   I think as a new user there really wasn\u2019t a speedy - intuitive path to information at least on first sign up.   But it might be that I just didn\u2019t look well enough. I just know as I was pawing around for some basic info I finally found Awesome-MakerDAO and the community-development - but I did not start there, and it was NOT obvious where to start. As I do more research on things I may change my mind on this.   I\u2019m just relaying my experience as a new user.    I remember distinctly sitting for a few hours just trying to find what I was looking for and reading a lot of links but not quite getting to where I wanted.  When I finally found Awesome-MakderDAO I was like there is a lot of material here and started reading and making notes. I also remember the search and reading was so daunting I actually let it sit for a few weeks till I came back again. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the post Scott as it is not obvious to me from the forum.makerdao.com front page that would indicate to me anything about Discourse (no powered by Discourse or anything in the following links or that I see on the forum itself etc.) I still need to check Davids onboarding guide(s). I also flipped up the menu here and checked. https://forum.makerdao.com/about https://forum.makerdao.com/faq and nothing that suggests anything about DIscourse or a link to the Discourse link you posted. I think I\u2019m really going to have to take some time (which currently in short supply atm) to explore everything I can find regarding MakerDAO since the more I paw around I find less of what I expect to find. So I am back to thinking about what should be in the Welcome thread.   The about and FAQ really are about forum \u2018decorum\u2019 and not really about MakerDAO which is what I was pawing about for.    Pretty much the Awesome MakerDAO but man that document slowed me down and put me off (and I already know a lot about Maker itself - the DAO part not so much at this point). https://awesome.makerdao.com But this document is \u2018thick\u2019 and \u2018dense\u2019.   I honestly have probably made it through like 1/4 (if that) of that document and the links there in just because of my time constraints and I have spent a fair amount of time on it.   I\u2019m making notes ofc and not just causual introductory reading and that is slowing me down.   I\u2019m literally talking ELI5 for newbs - a quick easy read than can be completed by anyone within an hour to give a basic quick \u2018Introduction to MakerDAO as well\u2019 - i.e. the DAO and Maker aspects, as well as introduction to \u2018official\u2019 channels - forum, etc.   This document by necessity would have either as embedded links or probably a link to a \u2018resources\u2019 page so users can use the \u2018Introduction to MakerDAO\u2019 page OR the resource page linked as the primary starting off point to dive deeper into aspects of MakerDAO beyond when they are looking for stuff. The point here is if we are looking at providing info to people from all perspectives IMO best to provide ELI5 summary info with links to midlevel info (Adult but not an expert in anything) and then the links to the very expert and sophisticated details (the literal guts). I want to make sure you guys aren\u2019t thinking I\u2019m just whining here.   I\u2019m a guy who digs through deep journals and has over 25 peer reviewed scientific publications (may be more now I don\u2019t know my VItae is not up to date with respect to papers) and I read thick deep stuff all the time.   For some reason what I encountered here really made me pause.    I think \u2018we\u2019 can do better but it will take some time and effort.    It is why I stopped just trying to quick scan Awesome MakerDAO and started a document with notes so I could gather all information and then try to digest it into a form more pallatable from my mind/eye. Which brings me to a last question. Is there a sort of complete \u2018resource\u2019 quide that has links to pretty much everything regarding MakerDAO?    I have a feeling AwesomeMaker DAO is trying to be that but until I literally get huge blocks of time to go through it I won\u2019t know. Thank you again for listening and I hope once we get through this we will have something people go \u2018wow, I learned so much so fast.   I\u2019m in.\u2019 ",

Put simply Maker is a permissionless(link), decentralized(link) bank that takes collateral(link) in the form of crypto deposits (e.g Ethereum) and gives the borrower cash. The loan is called a Collateralized Debt Position? The cash is given in a unique to Maker crypto token form called DAI (does DAI acronym stand for anything?). What is DAI?
