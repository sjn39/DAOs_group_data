                    "content": "Self-Insurance Fund SES Legal Research is the name which the Sustainable Ecosystem Core Unit uses for legal and regulatory topics and initiatives. In line with its vision of sustainably growing the Maker Protocol\u2019s moats by removing barriers between decentralized workforce, capital, and work. SES bootstraps a number of projects, some of which are of legal nature. This is the first proposal branded by SES Legal Research, but expect more content coming from SES, our incubees, and our grantees. After the dissolution of the Foundation, all DAO active members will be exposed to new layers of legal and regulatory risk. Active participants such as Core Unit contributors or facilitators and developers are exposed to different layers of liability risk, especially when acting outside a legal entity (whose main purpose is to limit liability of its members). SES Legal Research has identified the risk of key actors being the target of a legal or regulatory action as likely and potentially severe. Additionally, there is a necessity of including legal feedback in the DAO collective decision process, as the recent discussions with the implementation of DSS Vest showed. Fundamentally, the need for legal defense and advice for MakerDAO and its members is evident. SES Legal Research proposes to the community the establishment of a Legal Self-Insurance Fund. The purpose of this forum thread is to gauge the general sentiment around this idea and implement feedback from the community. What is Self-Insurance? Self-insurance is a well known risk management technique that consists in setting  funds for compensating a possible future loss. Although in theory any damage can be self insured, typically self insurance is used when significant and infrequent losses are expected and when risk can not be transferred through traditional instruments such as insurances. Why does MakerDAO need protection through a self-insurance fund? Traditional corporate instruments to transfer these risks such as D&O insurances are practically unavailable in crypto, and also not directly applicable in the novel context of DAOs. Crypto proficient legal advice is expensive and scarce in the market. The risk of legal or regulatory action against a DAO member is likely and potentially severe. These risks also represent a bottleneck for attracting new talent to the DAO. What risks can be covered? The fund can be structured in three layers: In a first layer, the Self Insurance Fund can cover legal costs of defense if a DAO member is the target of a lawsuit or  regulatory action. In a second layer, the fund can cover economic damages to third parties ordered by a Court of Justice as well as fines and penalties imposed by an administrative authority. In a third layer  the fund can be used as a legal reserve for obtaining a legal opinion or advice in an urgent or critical matter, such as the implementation of a new technological feature or a MIP. The first layer is less complex, so we would suggest starting with this one and then build up the other layers. Who will be covered? The fund should cover all permanent DAO participants such as: a) Facilitators, contributors and permanent members of Core Units b) Delegates c) Developers  A more formal determination of personal scope of the fund will be necessary. What are the benefits of  a Self Insurance Fund? Is a risk management tool appropriate for transferring risks of individuals interacting with the DAO. After properly structuring this fund, it is possible to use it as a first layer  for other products in the insurance market to transfer the rest of the risk. Additionally, it is a very flexible instrument that can be tailor made to cover the needs of the DAO, unlike more traditional insurance products. How large should the fund be and which countries should be covered?? Principally, any jurisdiction where a covered person is domiciled should be covered. However, a  technical and financial study for each layer is required to determine  our overall risk exposure, the coverage and the size of the fund. Arguably the largest risk exposure but also the most complex one is in the US. Probably it would be a good idea to start with a pilot project in a concrete jurisdiction. How will the fund be implemented in the MIP framework? I consider the Special Purpose Fund (MIP 55) as an appropriate framework for implementing the fund. It is high priority and narrow in scope and requests are one-off or irregular. MIP 55 explicitly states as one of the use cases legal reserves for the DAO. Next steps  Discuss and gather feedback from community Hire a feasibility study to determine risk exposure, size of fund and other parameters.  ",

The above are important points and pretty much cover everything that came to my mind when I first started reading this.    Of particular note 1&2 are going to be coupled.   My first thought was about (4).  Has anyone looked to whether and more just as importantly how much it would cost to lay off some of this risk and reduce the cost significantly by having a large deductible (.5-1M isn\u2019t unreasonable and probably a good number).   The question would be what such insurance covers and the maximum coverage.   Which leads us to (5) that is strongly coupled to (4).

For this reason, it would be helpful to separate concerns that specifically affect the DAO from concerns affecting CUs. No reason to self-insure against liabilities CUs can insure themselves against. @SES-Core-Unit, do you help the CUs in incubation understand what types of insurance are available and how to obtain them?

I read this as to qualify for these funds an entity would need to have their own liability insurance/umbrella insurance and then above that the DAO steps in?   My read at least on the initial post is that there would be a fund available if certain criterion were met.   The point here is if the DAO can lay off any of the insurance risk a reasonably large deductable should be applied.   Example is that say one of us gets sued for say 2M.  Sure we are going to have to mount our own legal defense, but even at the point we are served we should be able to make a claim for legal expenses based on (a).   Now lets say we spend like 250K to defend and we lose and the judgement is for $2M damages.   Presumption is the fund kicks in the 250K for defense (a) and the deductible would come from the fund ((b) for.5-1M of the damages) depending and then the DAO insurance would kick in for the 1.5-1M remaining in damages. Almost all insurance is going to have some deductible and my point was if any quote and terms could even be given the deductible should be reasonably large. I think a discussion regarding the amount in these funds and the conditions to access would be relevant so people know how much cash they have to have on hand to retain legal after being served before some fund related to (a) would kick in to help cover legal expenses to mount a defense.   Conditions where a judgement would quality for (b) probably also required because this is going to affect the insurance policy conditions risk and hence the cost.  The point to your question is that Maker itself would put up the funds to cover legal, and judgements and use the insurance policy to cover stuff that goes above what the DAO think it could reasonably fund. Personally I think the idea of such a fund here is such that it could be quickly drawn upon.  We don\u2019t want anyone trying to work for Maker left in the cold under attack and unable to mount a reasonable defense because of available personal cash limitations. ",

Very important. We have to discuss as a community the overall strategy for legal defense / advice of MakerDAO. The Self Insurance Fund is only one part of it. We are working in SES in several projects related to public policy, advocacy, compliance, etc that we will soon share . Regarding legal advice, I agree that it should be done by external counsel and not by a potential Legal CU, but struggle with with the idea of one \u201cbig law firm\u201d and instead think advice should be more granular and specialized.

We identify with our incubees some of the risks involved in interacting with MakerDAO, and at the same time advice them that it s their responsibility to comply with local regulations and get proper legal advice in their respective jurisdiction. Sometimes the risks of Core Units  are clearly differentiated from those of the DAO, in others there is an overlap. If a critical CU can\u2019t operate normally or goes insolvent because a lawsuit, it can turn into a severe risk for the DAO. At SES, we tackle the risks at the DAO level. In the current setup, there is practically no insurance product for transferring legal and liability risks. With the self insurance fund in place that will change. ",

The point here is if the DAO can lay off any of the insurance risk a reasonably large deductable should be applied. Example is that say one of us gets sued for say 2M. Sure we are going to have to mount our own legal defense, but even at the point we are served we should be able to make a claim for legal expenses based on (a). Now lets say we spend like 250K to defend and we lose and the judgement is for $2M damages. Presumption is the fund kicks in the 250K for defense (a) and the deductible would come from the fund ((b) for.5-1M of the damages) depending and then the DAO insurance would kick in for the 1.5-1M remaining in damages.   Thank you for your post. Yes, that would be possible, we can structure the self insurance fund to meet our needs. Let\u2019s say we use it for legal defense and settlement / civil claims up to a limit, for the rest we go look for an excess of loss reinsurance. ",

We need everyone to have defensible ground (a limited liability business wrapper) and the arms to defend it with (insurance up to X and then this DAO-supplied fund beyond that). The reinsurance and other elements can be rolled out over coming months, but I would like to set a goal of everyone who provides work for or receives compensation from the DAO in 90 days to have: -all individuals interacting through some form of limited liability vehicle -some record or statement publicly that confirms to any external observers that no contributors are interacting with the DAO as private individuals -those limited liability vehicles have appropriate insurance to serve as a qualifying deductible to access any Maker self-insurance funds -a self-insurance fund established, and preferably with the ability to contract in a manner that binds it to honor its obligations to DAO member entities -a clear definition of what (beyond deductible) qualifies a DAO entity to obligate this fund -educational materials and advice for those who need help establishing a limited liability entity and acquiring the correct insurance coverage to survive until the fund kicks in (regulatory is usually separate from liability, though I suspect the latter is more urgent if both cannot be acquired) I welcome refinements and suggestions to the above, but think a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d of this deserves rapid roll-out and reduces tail risk more than anything else we can do at the moment. A firm commitment to and plan for protecting DAO entities can also serve as a major recruitment tool for anyone who works in traditional businesses and takes for granted a legal shield between them and their business activities. It will also set a good example for other DAOs who lack the expertise to figure out how to do this kind of thing. ",

One factor that complicates this issue is the fact that any counsel retained by Core Units is ultimately going to put the CU\u2019s interest ahead of the DAOs so while I like the idea of CUs retaining counsel and sharing advice, I think paying for opinions to be delivered collectively to key stakeholders on a private call would be a good way to help ensure we\u2019re receiving sound advice. I\u2019m happy to help organize if anyone\u2019s interested in making this happen. ",

Plus contributors working inside don\u2019t expose their family mortgage equity & other personal assets to legal actions, which they are at the moment. My understanding is no limit on consequential losses means no cap (your house + everything else) if operating as a sole trader. No amount of wage covers that risk\u2026 ",

                    "content": "Quick note re co-ops (given that I\u2019ve seen them referenced here and in other places): certain state statutes, such as the Colorado Limited Cooperative Association statute and a similar schema in Minnesota,  include limited exemptions from state securities laws (\u201cBlue Sky\u201d laws) for patron membership interests. However, there is no outright exemption from federal securities laws for those same membership interests. Here\u2019s a hypothetical example: if a project like the Uniswap DAO organized as a co-op it would almost certainly consider UNI as evidence of one\u2019s patron membership in the DAO and, as a result,  UNI would clearly be a security and subject to burdens in case one wants to transfer that interest across state lines to another individual. In addition,  look at Opolis. Registering with their DAO requires KYC and,  I believe,  their governance tokens are non-transferable precisely because they are considered securities. Bottom line,  while the cooperative form is interesting and certainly has similarities to how some DAOs operate,  it\u2019s not a saviour that solves all the purported securities-related issues for individuals and groups not under common control that happen to work together loosely on a computing protocol. I will say though,  DAOs, in my opinion, function similarly to coops. I just wish there were tweaks to potentially fruitful statutes to really get us (DAOs generally) over the line. ",
