Also mention  Interestingly, the euro recently fell to parity against the U.S. dollar for the first time since 2002.  If previously the stablecoins linked to the Euro were not so interesting or in demand, now it will be much less interesting, let\u2019s see if Circle or BlackRock will take any action with respect to what happened. In the EUROC post, I mentioned the following before the Euro reached 1:1 with the Dollar, with the difficult situation in Europe I could already see something like this coming end.  After all, it seems to be better that only Dai exists 1:1 with the Dollar, unless this recession ends up unleashing an economic catastrophe that makes an even more radical change in the world monetary economy, and it would be better to anchor Dai to another fiat currency. The economy of the European Union has weakened a lot lately, but the block of Russia, China and India not so much, I think that if in the future they bring out an alternative Dai, it would be better that it is linked to the more robust economy of the East, that makes more sense than alternatives of Dai concentrated in the West.
