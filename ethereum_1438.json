A mid-layer can be added between the two sides by minting ERC3754 NFTs as rights to purchase NFTs. NFT creators can presale such rights at lower prices and hence are able to set the initial prices higher. For NFT buyers, buying such rights is a small commitment and can sell them if they do not like the NFTs minted later on. The rights are made liquid by EIP-3754. Such right can be best understood as a call option on an NFT. Effectively, this is a market making layer by reducing the bid-ask spread. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks! ",
