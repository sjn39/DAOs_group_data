                    "content": "Introduction For those that don\u2019t know me, my name is Balloonist (S\u00f8ren), and I\u2019m part of the incubation program aiming to ramp up a legal resiliency Core Unit in MakerDAO - I joined the incubator 10 days ago. This is my first forum post, so I owe you a beer if I am totally off with this discussion. Why is there full transparency for on-chain voting? I am curious why the on-chain voting is designed as voting by show of hands instead of voting by ballot. Please see this example showing the current level of details published for an on-chain voting: Maker Governance - Offboarding Parameters for UNIV2DAIETH-A - May 30, 2022  Screenshot 2022-06-11 at 17.27.441820\u00d7840 134 KB  Show of hands vs. ballot Pros: Show of hands  It may be easier to document that decisionmaking in MakerDAO is decentralized. Transparency around delegates\u2019 votes is useful for documenting that opinions and actions are aligned. It is great for further discussion in small groups with a high level of mutual trust.  Pros: Ballot  The voters are protected against intimidation, etc. post-voting. It reduces the risk of corruption (because it is more difficult to buy votes). It is possible to documented who voted without revealing their choices. Voters can bring arguments for or against the proposal no matter what they voted.  When bringing this up, I am aware that:  for many of the voting pools, there is 100% support which will reveal what each voter voted. I believe we can come up with a solution to fix this. It\u2019s makes it harder to prove how decentralized MakerDAO actually is, as one person could control several wallets (one could argue that the same could be the case for \u2018show of hands\u2019). it would require the code of conduct for recognized delegates to be changed a bit. *when the result is based on total number of MKR-tokens voting, this would require some kind of maneuver to be able to keep the voters choice anonymous.  LongForWisdom made it clear, that delegates can not be anonymous. However, this is not the case, it is only the actual decision when voting that will be made anonymous.  Please let me know, what you think? I prefer the on-chain voting to be by:     Raise of hands Ballot     0 voters     ",

IMO, just because governments do something, doesn\u2019t mean it is always a good idea. For instance, delegates do not enjoy the same protection as politicians do. And to my knowledge governments do not yet consider using blockchain/private-keys when voting - today\u2019s voting method would probably be rigged if anonymous voting were used by governments (or be blamed for being rigged, which is nearly just as bad).

I agree with you, MKR holders who are delegating their MKR are entitled to know how their chosen delegate is using their voting power, to some degree. Having full transparency on how the delegates are voting especially makes sense to me for proposals of low complexity. However, I believe once the complexity of the proposals is getting much higher, it becomes a matter of trust or dependence on the delegates\u2019 skills and judgment. My answer to why anyone would delegate millions of dollars worth of MKR voting power, without being able to supervise how the power was being used on a day-to-day basis, would be that the MKR holders are relying on the chosen delegate\u2019s political standpoint, strategy, expertise, and \u2018business judgment\u2019 as the delegates most likely are better suited making these decisions than the average MKR holders.

The current system works because it is very obvious if a delegate is misrepresenting their votes when they communicate because it is visible on the blockchain. It is trustless.

I am considering the balance of transparency and MKR holder-supervision on one side and business judgment and responsible management by the delegates on the other side. When looking at traditional organizational structures in the corporate world, the shareholders appoints the Board of Directors (BoD), which then appoints the Board of Management (BoM). In this scenario, the shareholders have to rely on the high-level reporting from the management and have to wait and see how the company performs, it is accepted that the management from time to time makes the wrong decisions, but overall the decisions have to be correct for the company to succeed long-term. I see delegates as some kind of a hybrid between the BoD and BoM in symbiosis with the CUs and the MKR holders. Too tight a grip around the delegates can be slowing down or compromise the decision-making that is required to let MakerDAO move forward. ",

I share your concerns about puppeteering @Balloonist and actually quite like @ChrisBlec\u2019s idea to represent all votes from a particular delegator (perhaps in a separate chart/screen compared to the main delegate vote screen). But I would prefer to counter that issue in a way that still preserves the inherent transparency of the DAO\u2019s governance. ",

As stated above, I agree ballot voting probably is not the right thing to pursue at the moment with the coin voting governance framework and the current delegation framework in place. There are different ways to approach the issue, ballot voting was just the first I wanted to discuss. Two chamber voting like Optimism or one person one vote discussed with Vitalik here are some other options. ",
