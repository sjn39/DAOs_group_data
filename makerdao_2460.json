                    "content": "Hello Maker community, This is my proposal to include Tether USD (USDT) as a collateral asset for MCD. Note: This proposal refers to the ERC-20 implementation of Tether USD.  1) Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Cole Kennelly (@ColeGotTweets)  2) Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. USDT is a collateralized ERC-20 token that is pegged to the US Dollar. USDT is the largest stablecoin in the crypto ecosystem in terms of market capitalization and supply.  3) Provide a brief history of the project. The precursor to Tether, Realcoin, was announced in July 2014. The first Realcoin tokens were issued in October 2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Omni Layer Protocol. In November 2014, the Realcoin project was renamed to Tether. USDT was deployed to the Ethereum network on November 28, 2017 and formally announced on January 5, 2018. Since launch, ~1.5 million unique addresses have made more than 40 million USDT transfers.  4) Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. OpenZeppelin Audit  5) Link to any active communities relating to your project. Twitter Blog Email  6) How is the applying collateral type currently used? USDT is used by businesses, such as exchanges, wallets, etc., to use US Dollars on the Ethereum blockchain. USDT is also used as a collateral asset by leading decentralized finance protocols and applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Compound.  7) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Tether Holdings Limited bears responsibility for USDT. Tether Holdings Limited is a British Virgin Islands-based entity.  8) Where does exchange for the asset occur? Exchange of USDT occurs on approximately 100 different secondary exchanges including centralized exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, Bitfinex, Kraken, FTX, and KuCoin. The entire list of exchanges where USDT trades can be found here. Thank you, Cole Kennelly ",

The point of MakerDAO is to allow a basket of assets, some of which may be risky, under the assumption that the risk is very low for the combined basket to undercollateralize the existing Dai supply. I think Tether should have extremely high requirements for vaults, driving users to submit other tokens besides Tether. Specifically a very low debt ceiling and a very high reserve ratio requirement. I would be happy with USDT taking up no more than 10% of the total reserves by having an extremely low Debt Ceiling that doesn\u2019t increase ($10M), along with a possibly 10x USDT to DAI reserve ratio.

There are some arguments to make about liquidity, and whether tether alters the volatility of eth, btc, and other cryptocurrencies, but I think the effects are subtle and complex. If tether were to have a major scandal tomorrow and become worthless, it\u2019s not obvious that this would negatively affect prices for the rest of the market, and possible it could prop up other top currencies as holders exit in mass. Overall I just don\u2019t think this speculation about maker\u2019s current exposure to tether should hold any weight in our decision of its viability as onboarded collateral. ",

IT is only possible by bringing in assets that has the LEAST risks embedded in them so the transition of low interest rates from capital markets could be the most EFFICIENT. Check out USDT borrowing rates - its double digits. Because of unknown collaterization ratio and inability to check to what the issuing entity has access too. Still, there are some 30+k MKR holders who dont understand the way credit risk is valued ;( ",

If you want to take a greater role in governing the Maker Protocol, we are more than happy to welcome you. That said, please don\u2019t imply that MKR Holders are ignorant or unaware of the risks. It\u2019s bad form. I know Tether makes as easy target, but I would much prefer that you jump into governance and become a member of this community more generally rather than focusing on competing collateral types. ",

Is there a Tether representative that MakerDAO could request additional information from regarding the composition of Tether\u2019s reserves? Tether surely should understand that they have something to gain by being included as collateral on the MakerDAO protocol and maybe be willing to at least make some attempt to answer some risk questions we have.
