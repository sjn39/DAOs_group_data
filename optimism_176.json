Through fun and engaging gameplay, users are able to enjoy matches and directly mint rewards from the blockchain without large gas fees by playing. Dragonia cosmetic rewards and Trainer NFTs are purchasable and verified collections on Quixotic.  image1272\u00d7714 127 KB  The user interface (shown above) when playing a game of Defend Dragonia (card game), which consists of three different elements through a rock-paper-scissors-style mechanic. Dragonia Trainer holders also receive a portion of fees from secondary sales. We are currently working on a story-driven visual novel, more airdrops and additional gamemodes to Defend Dragonia.  Proposal for token distribution:  How will the OP tokens be distributed?  80% - Player rewards and incentives; players that earn XP through winning games can gradually unlock rewards in the  current season pass. Token distribution will gradually be added to these reward pools  to incentivize playing. 20% - Marketing and community growth to drive more attention/traction, as well as expenses (such as server hosting costs).  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? GOAL: Showcase P2E gaming and the benefits of building on Optimism The token distribution will be used to grow the player base and incentivize playing matches. To help sustain this project\u2019s development and incentivize user interaction/engagement, this funding proposal would help us to continue expanding the Dragonia ecosystem (more games, more action!) and community. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Dragonia has many different rewards such as NFTs, cosmetic skins and other planned partnerships (e.g. WL spots for other projects that can be earned through playing). Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? There is no set period for token distribution as of right now. Considering that there are approximately 3-4 seasons yearly (each with unique lore and updates), token distribution allocated for rewards should last multiple seasons but ultimately depends on the number of players. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Dragonia does not have a token. However, players can earn NFTs via our season rewards (earned through winning matches) and other airdrops. We will also create some special in-game art + NFTs for this event. ",

We also align with the spirit of public goods, and to be honest, the name \u2018Optimism\u2019 itself sealed the deal. We love it when the community is able to critique and provide suggestions, since that\u2019ll ultimately just make the entire Dragonia project better.   Which part of the docs is unclear? We can add more detail to it or explain further where necessary.   After a player wins one game, they earn XP, which can be accrued to unlock rewards and it is documented on-chain. We plan to distribute OP rewards as season milestones (reached by winning matches and earning said XP).   We don\u2019t have a token, which many P2E projects seem to have and sustain themselves on (causing inevitable decreases in price due to expenses/team payments). We have already started rewarding players with NFTs (mainly cosmetics) they can directly mint, however we plan to start issuing out other rewards such as WL spots with projects we partner with, so there\u2019ll be inherent value to that.   I completely understand what you mean with P2E being an exhausting narrative. We wanted to prioritize actual gameplay, as opposed to just gamifying DeFi interactions like a gamified DEX, for instance. We built an actual game that we plan to keep rolling out updates for, as we add new stuff (like our upcoming visual novel) to our ecosystem. ",

                    "content": "Let me just quickly break down the current system we have in place for seasons. We launched Dragonia with Season 1: Inception. Rewards in the season pass are unlocked at 70 XP milestones. Reward 1: 70 XP Reward 2: 140 XP (And so on\u2026) Whenever a player wins a match, they earn 10 XP. This can be claimed (per Trainer) once a day, meaning that it\u2019ll take a week to unlock a reward. However, if you have more Trainers,  you can then earn more XP a day (2 Trainers = 20 XP, 3 Trainers = 30 XP, etc.). With 9 unlockable Season 1 rewards, Season 1 lasts a total of 9 weeks. Each season should last at minimum 2 months, with approximately 1 month transition periods in between each season. The 80% distribution for user rewards should last at least 4 seasons (~1 year). Assuming the distribution is planned at 16,000 OP, there are different methods we can implement: The first method is scattering these OP token rewards amongst other season rewards. We believe setting X amount of OP per season is the right approach. Assuming that each season has 4,000 OP tokens assigned for it (4,000 x 4 = 16,000). This is an ideal way to handle the rewards otherwise allowing players to earn X amount of. 4,000 for now is just a number I used for easy reference. For example, each Trainer at a 0.02 ETH mint price is equivalent to ~40 OP tokens as of right now. Let\u2019s assume there are 100 players actively progressing through the season pass: this would net a return of 40 OP tokens if every single one fully completed the season rewards. We need to play around with these figures to find a good balance for OP rewards before each season (take a snapshot of # of players). The second is creating an extra difficult AI opponent to beat (giving users only 1 chance per Trainer to beat in a given day) to earn X amount of OP. Going this method would mean that once the OP prize pool for the season has depleted, players would no longer be able to earn OP token rewards from defeating said opponent, so it may not be super sustainable in practice. An alternative approach would be to have \u2018spontaneous limited-time boss battles\u2019 with OP token rewards, which would also encourage players to keep close tabs and hence boost community engagement. The last method is making it so when players win a match, they earn a \u2018ticket\u2019. This ticket can then enter the player into a pot, which at the end of, say a week, will randomly select a winner who earns X amount of OP tokens. This means you would earn 10 XP + a ticket every time a day (per Trainer when you win). Not sure how this would work in practice because it seems quite \u2018lottery\u2019-ish. Happy to hear anyone\u2019s thoughts on this! We\u2019re open to all kinds of ideas. As @mastermojo stated, a larger token distribution could be beneficial and we can also draft up more plans for that. ",

This is an incorrect use of the $OP tokens from this fund. I can see your comment from a couple of days ago, but it would be better to give specifics for the token distribution for both (player rewards and marketing) 1.How many daily users do you have? 2. Distribution is very vague, you should present a more detailed plan for OP distribution. ",

                    "content": "Completely understand what you mean regarding the 20%. We currently have 492 Trainers minted in total. We were actually discussing this internally and have a new idea we\u2019d like to propose for the remaining token distribution: We bump user rewards to 90%, and the remaining 10% goes towards expenses including:  Dedicated RPC node for leaderboards, multiplayer and other features Server hosting costs (to keep the game actively running)  We project that this 10% could fund the nodes and servers for 1.5 - 2 years approximately. For token distribution, I presented some ideas in a reply above. If we added these OP token rewards to the season rewards, we can allocate 4,000 OP tokens per season (giving us enough for 4 whole seasons of gameplay). To encourage users to keep playing throughout the entire season and winning XP whilst unlocking different rewards, setting the OP token reward at the end of the season would make sense. If 100 Trainers are used to complete the season rewards, then that means each Trainer will receive a 40 OP (4000 / 100) airdrop for doing so. We would definitely prefer this \u2018fixed amount of tokens per season\u2019 approach over \u2018first come, first serve\u2019, as it would unfairly favor those that own multiple Trainers who can grind out the rewards quicker.
