Nadia    Initiatives Update  GUSD Partnership Update  Sebastian Derivaux 12:18     GUSD & MakerDAO Partnership Announcement Integrations       Hi to all the members of the Maker community!  In order to deepen our partnership with Maker, we have been working closely with the Strategic Finance Core Unit and the Growth Core Unit to understand how Gemini can contribute to strengthening the Maker ecosystem. We came up with the below proposal and look forward to hearing the community\u2019s feedback!  For more context and information on the support of Maker by Gemini our original GUSD PSM proposal can be found here: Proposal: GUSD PSM  The Gemini\u2026      Gemini has approved the payment flow for the rewards. Funds will be received in December and transferred directly to MakerDAO without needing a legal entity. They will pay an annual rate of 1.25%.   Discussion  Crimson Cluster  hexonaut  717\u00d7402 68.9 KB  14:46  We want to work with other crypto projects, vertically incorporate them under MKR, and support DAI as a first-class citizen. Our first project is an advanced money market.  16:09  Q&A  2326\u00d71276 188 KB  20:17   Patrick_J: Do you have plans for cross-chain as part of Crimson?   Hexonaut: Absolutely!! We need to get multi-chain support for accounting and the vault engine.    22:17   ElPro: How do you plan to implement ALM strategies?   Hexonaut: We have yet to think much about this, but it\u2019s something to consider in the future.    24:28   Matt: How do you jump-start the community of token holders for the Creator DAO beyond farming? Is there a natural fit for community contributors?   Hexonaut: Some may farm for speculation, others for community engagement. The initial release will offer the best features and rates within the market to bootstrap everything.    26:08   Tim Black: Are you having algorithmic rates for the lending engine?   Hexonaut: Yes, for the lending engine. However, for the collaterals, we will use other lending markets like Aave, Compound, etc.    27:30   ElPro: How does your cluster envision ecosystem actors helping out both within and outside?   Hexonaut: The team is meant to be administrative, where we pool these actors together. We will be contracting them.    30:11   David Utrobin: Is Crimson Cluster expecting to be its MetaDAO? Do you plan to join others?   Hexonaut: Standalone MetaDAO.     Discussion  Viridian Cluster  Alan Peterson 30:57 Viridian Cluster Overview Presentation:  725\u00d7403 180 KB   726\u00d7408 123 KB   729\u00d7409 68.6 KB   727\u00d7410 77.5 KB   729\u00d7404 223 KB   728\u00d7409 104 KB   730\u00d7408 166 KB   729\u00d7408 122 KB   730\u00d7411 98.5 KB   730\u00d7407 49.9 KB   731\u00d7411 94.8 KB   722\u00d7412 192 KB   729\u00d7406 168 KB   836\u00d7412 69.7 KB   Q&A  2483\u00d71380 221 KB  47:29   ElPro: How is your cluster thinking on the possibility of going risk-on and partnering with arrangers who go after riskier opportunities?   Allan: If there\u2019s capital for that, we will try to do that. At the moment, given the current situation, we will not be increasing the risk.    51:25   ElPro: How do you plan on hedging risk for the residential mortgage-backed securities when exposed to it via arrangers?  57:26   David Utrobin: Given the current environment, why not go all-in to earn over 4% with minimal risk?   Sebastian: We could, but the potential problem is that we will have to give back part of this cash flow by increasing the DSR.    1:00:36   David Kret: All these MIPs are in Maker Core. How do you envision vault adoption taking place from a technical perspective?   Allan: We\u2019re still determining. We know it will take place, but the technical features will be developed over the next months. These are still very early stages.    1:01:50   David Utrobin: To what extent can you be a true DAO while engaging with entities and regulators?  1:10:16   David Utrobin: Is the Viridian Cluster responsible for risk assessments regarding its RWA deals?   Rajiv: I believe so, but we are only a few weeks in and building the team for this.    1:11:35   David Utrobin: Is the Viridian Cluster intending to be its metaDAO?   Allan: If we can all find a good way to work together, there\u2019s an opportunity for cross-cluster sharing. But Viridian can work on its methods for asset management strategies to support DAI stability and growth.    1:14:56   David Utrobin: Has anyone considered what happens to the protocol if any of the \u2018horses\u2019 go insolvent?   Allan: We\u2019ve built it to be highly unlikely. However, each arrangement is very solid and has a very low probability of losing a large amount of value.

It enables canceling a past executive vote waiting to be executed within the GSM pause delay.   1630\u00d7712 180 KB  13:31   Astro: The purpose of this MIP is to defend Maker against Governance attacks: where the attacker has enough MKR to take over and pass potentially malicious executives.  The distribution of MKR could end up concentrated in a few people\u2019s hands. When there is a potential attack, there will be misinformation. If we can stop a malicious executive without shutting down the protocol, that would be preferred. TLDR version: if MKR holders think Maker is under governance attack, and the hat cannot be retaken, they can deposit their own MKR into a contract called DSS Defender. Some threshold amount needs to be deposited before the contract is activated, and it can only be triggered once. Once the threshold is reached, the protocol is locked into its current state.    21:12   Prose11: Why delegates can\u2019t we use the defender contractor for the lockup in particular?   Astro: I wanted a version where delegates could use it. However, we currently have a liquid delegation, which causes issues between delegates and delegators regarding the penalty of MIP91.    22:58   ultraschuppi: How can you lock your MKR and Dss Defender and put it into the emergency shutdown module?   Astro: You can\u2019t move it to any address except the ESM.    23:34   David Utrobin: Can DSS Defender delay an executive multiple times?   Astro: If the attacker has the hat, they will spam multiple execs. The Dss Defender will cancel all of them permissionlessly.    24:20   David Utrobin: Is it correct that after the cancel duration, the DSS Defender Auto redeploys itself?   Astro: That\u2019s not true. Check MIP91c3: Post-activation Permissions and Events on the forum for more information.    25:58   David Utrobin: Do delegates or other stakeholders have any cons on their minds about this?   Derek: An attack where PE deploys a fix to an existing vulnerability where an attacker can reverse engineer the vulnerability by looking at PE\u2019s fix within 48 hours. They can deposit MKR into the defender as well.    27:17   David Utrobin: Can\u2019t the DSS Defender contract be designed in a way where it cancels all except some?   Astro: You would end up trusting governance in that case.    35:35   Prose11: How likely is such an attack in the first place that e have seen attacks like these?  In terms of severe attacks, the answer is no. If we were ever in this scenario, our only option is the ESM, which would ripple throughout the entire industry.     Discussion  MIP84c10-SP1: Modify Emulated SB Upper Limit 42:32  Overview1588\u00d7803 141 KB   1033\u00d71016 160 KB   1069\u00d71012 129 KB  47:35   Psychonaut: The idea is to change the defaults from the current proposal to a proposal that does not envision immediately taking on considerable leverage.  53:06   Chat: The Starting Capital defines the DC. The initial 20m would be divided by 1.25 to define the Lower Limit. If there is some Excess Dai which is the remaining amount of Dai in the Surplus Buffer, and if there is something about the Upper Limit, this Excess Dai will effectively become part of the Starting Capital.  57:19   Psychonaut: The Collateral Ratio defines the Lower Limit. And because there is a sub-proposal to change the Collateral Ratio, the Lower Limit can also be changed by it.   David Utrobin: If the Upper Limit was set high to the point where we do not have Excess Dai. Does it mean we would have zero Starting Collateral?  Psychonaut: No, because Starting collateral is defined as its parameter.  Payton Rose: Once that happens, if the Upper Limit does not change, the initial MIP suggested is at 40 million Dai, so if we accrue more than that in our Surplus Buffer, we would be automatically expecting to lever it back in. If you raise the Upper Limit, then that re-up levering would only happen at the Risk CU\u2019s direct wishes, which is mandated with overseeing this and giving monthly reports.    1:00:07:   Payton Rose: As the proposal author, why do you feel more comfortable with Dai emulating as the Surplus Buffer instead of a leveraged ETH position for backing Dai?   Psychonaut: If we have a leveraged position in stETH, we risk the protocol becoming insolvent. We have a Surplus Buffer to sustain losses if some of the collateral goes bad and does not become insolvent. If we have the Surplus Buffer in Dai, we know that buffer against losses will be there when needed. If it is stETH, then we do not know.    1:02:07   PaperImperium: I would like to see an effort to define and separate Dai held as loss reserves.   monet-supply: The flip side of the scenario is that Maker\u2019s capital at risk tends to increase in bull markets.  ElPro: People who are fully sitting on ETH are much more comfortable than those sitting on other things. If you are holding ETH, you are not feeling much pain. This helps build a lot of DAI backing into decentralized collateral. It gets away from the addiction of being backed by USDC and others.    1:05:21   Payton Rose: ETH is super collateral. Liquid State Derivatives will play a huge part in this ecosystem going forward, and getting your hands o a bunch of them sooner rather than later could prove quite lucrative. It is also powerful to keep in mind that these are yield-bearing assets.   Psychonaut: stETH is a great asset, but it is one thing to invest in that asset without leverage, and another thing is to invest it with leverage. If you are trying to keep your loss reserve safe, then you do not use leverage.  ElPro: You have to weigh what risks you want to take and how safely you want to think. With the lower mint and the upper mint, and with the risk involved and analyzing it, it is worth giving it a try. There is a lot that still needs to be figured out.    1:07:57   Payton Rose: Why did you pursue raising the Upper Limit instead of trying to stop this entirely from happening?   Psychonaut: I was tempted to stop it from happening, but there seems to be a lot of momentum and interest in support of Rune\u2019s idea, and I want to respect that. It was the minor change I could make to reduce the risk that Maker would be taking on with the POVE.    1:10:40   Payton Rose: This Vault Engine is still being developed. Some technical aspects might force our understanding to change slightly, but this is the intention of Rune\u2019s MIP and what the DAO will be trying to carry out since it was passed.   Derek: The technical work is already known. It is ordered, so we will see what comes back, pending any feedback from it.    1:13:56   Robert: Quick update that relates to MIP 81. We are trying to confirm and evaluate the timing of the two solutions\u2019 overhead. There is the one listed in the MIP and the one with the smart contract. The smart contract approach continues to lead with a shorter overall implementation time and reduces risk in managing USDC. PE has reviewed and provided feedback on the smart contract. Again, indications are that the smart contract approach is faster than finding a new arranger, which is the traditional custodial approach. With the smart contract approach, no monies are transferred in the real world, allowing us to use an existing arranger like Monetalis and formalize the arrangement with Coinbase.  Feedback from Strategic Finances shows that this could be implemented by December 7th. We are working as hard as we can to complete it this year. Reach out to us for any questions.

Discussion  Discussion: Recent Events & Impact on MakerDAO   Risk CU & Others 37:41  836\u00d7419 121 KB  38:33   Rema: I will speak on why we had the emergency executive vote. We are experiencing a crypto-centralized financial crisis that also impacts the DeFi ecosystem and permissionless actions to a certain extent. Some crypto projects, some even calling themselves DAOs, used FTX for custody. Due to fear and uncertainty, we might see large liquidations that will result in significant drops in prices. This will affect Maker\u2026  48:43   Payton Rose: Patrick O\u2019Donald asks in the chat what the impact on demand from borrowing from certain vaults is.  50:48  850\u00d7473 369 KB  52:43   Sebestien Derivaux: To answer the first question, Gemini is a trust and more secure than Circle. The main issue is that the funds would be frozen for some time.  To answer the second question, we have a PSM, but it still needs to be developed to dispose of GUSD. Deployment would take up to one week. It would take up to a few months to redeem our GUSD safely. Gemini does provide proof of reserve. The last report was in September.    57:46  847\u00d7477 275 KB  58:26   Sebestien Derivaux: These events won\u2019t affect the implementation of MIP81. We have smart contracts that remove additional risk and allow for quick liquidation. Coinbase has ensured that they are top-notch custody.  1:01:21  849\u00d7474 345 KB    Payton Rose: Kianga from ArkInvest asks whether you can speak to the de-peg risks.  1:03:50   Payton Rose: What about USD, for example? We saw a lot of speculation on Twitter. What if people on Twitter gather up and try to sell in mass, and we say a de-peg on GUSD? What would be the protocol there?  1:05:51   Payton Rose: What risks does the protocol have, and what actions can we take to mitigate it?  1:08:44   Payton Rose: Do you have figures on how our value-at-risk compares to how it was a month ago?  1:17:45   Sebestien Derivaux: Regarding the last question, you have the vault type and the current situation. We always looked like debt weighted collateral ratio.  1:20:34  848\u00d7479 312 KB  Suggestion Box  Credits  Constanza produced this summary. Larry Wu produced this summary.
