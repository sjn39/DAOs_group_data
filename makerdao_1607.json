I\u2019m getting the titular error when attempting to pay back all my DAI debt with the \u201cChanging Vault\u201d action. I tested both Firefox and Chrome and tried the trezor bridge as well as metamask with trezor connected. This error can be reproduced in all cases. I didn\u2019t assume there was a backend server, as dapps often are static, but apparently, the error indicates that there is one. Here is the behaviour of the site when trying to change the vault. I did not get a transaction to sign:  screenshot983\u00d7692 59.4 KB  And this is the error text:  Lost connection   It looks like we lost a connection to some data. Hit reload below to reload your page. If this error persists, please get in touch at [email\u00a0protected]  I did send a support email but I hope there is a google-searchable discussion here so users with similar issue can stop bothering the support. I repeated the test with Singapore and Australian IP address with the same error. ",

I understand from the Oasis.app support team that your specific case has since been resolved. The Lost Connection error showed up misleadingly, whilst this was a calculation error. We will make sure that this error is properly shown to users. ",
