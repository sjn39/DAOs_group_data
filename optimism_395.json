That is, people flock where they find permanent, evergreen educational resources. For example, when I personally started looking into picking up a few blockchain skills I (unsurprisingly?) began with Googling quite a bit. What I found is that Ethereum was the only blockchain skills I could really pick up quite quickly. Not because the tech was the best, or because this education was the lowest cost or most effective, etc. It was because trying to learn anything beyond Solidity and its associated skills was very, very difficult because of the simple fact that they couldn\u2019t be located. There was just nothing out there. It seemed like \u2018everyone\u2019 was learning and building with Solidity and Ethereum. So if the focus is maximising the number of developers building on Optimism, then wouldn\u2019t vast amounts of educational content and permanent, online communities be a straightforward solution? Content with a low barrier to entry, that is globally accessible, that offers a quick way for existing developers to transfer their existing skills across to Optimism\u2019s technology? Overall, when choosing successful grants, let\u2019s try and make \u2018everyone\u2019 think that Optimism is the Layer 2 \u2018everyone\u2019 already uses. I think this requires mass distribution over anything too niche or discrete. ",

                    "content": "Nice list, @Gonna.eth - especially like the EIP Implementation tryouts. In general, I think a good way to structure these RfGs is with the following in mind: we don\u2019t want \u2018categories\u2019. We want specific additions that will directly unblock the experience for builders and users in a way that\u2019s unmatched by other ecosystems \u2013 that is, in a way that gives Optimism a competitive advantage over other EVM ecosystems. There is some powerful stuff happening under the hood on Optimism, but we\u2019re at a stage where increasing accessibility to the new features rolling out and having a product-oriented focus will pay off significantly down the line. This may be an evolving post, but below are examples of things that could work well for Optimism. Some are concrete and tightly defined, some came through dev feedback, and some are possibly crazy and undoable ideas but hopefully might spark some thinking.  Contests I think it\u2019s worth canvassing the protocols that exist now and see what sorts of things will make their lives easier. I think of Perp Protocol, which recently supported a lone dev in building out a swap layer that uses other protocols for liquidity. These types of multi-protocol integrations could be very interesting. One could hold a competition seeking implementations that maximize composability between protocols, and devs could show their work to demonstrate how others could follow. In addition, the absence of a robust bizdev team means there might be an opportunity for the community to help forge some larger partnerships. Imagine a partnership with Visa the way Starknet has made. We could offer bounties to individuals or teams facilitating some connections.  Devtools  Agnostic pricing APIs. Working with existing pricing APIs is a big dev drag in defi, as they often are incomplete and buggy. Illiquid assets are very difficult to track. Cron jobs for view functions / historical data. The engineer who floated this idea to me had this to say: \u201cRight now if e.g. a derivatives dex wants to be able to have users trustlessly figure out what their current open positions are, they generally need to build an entire complex subgraph pulling data from many contracts. But often these teams have to cut corners and don\u2019t build out subgraphs or historical data solutions. A non-Dune/Graph solution could help.\u201d Oracles (e.g., https://oracles.rip/  Official account abstraction SDK. This could be immensely useful for appchains leveraging OP Stack. Official ENS support More onramps and offramps with large institutions More facilitation of staking ETH through OP. E.g,. what if we could make all ETH deposited onto OP contract staked immediately?   Defi and dApps  More complete ETH staking plugins. Right now there\u2019s nowhere really Gearbox fork (would help with yields on LSDs) Autocompounders / LP managers for bridge liquidity More metagovernance projects that can call back to L1 (more involved versions of what Curve made to facilitate voting on Mainnet) More synthetic assets please @Matt  Anything involving the use of OP Stack (I\u2019m intentionally vague here because we need people to start working on it to pave a way for others) MEV tooling for mainnet, .e.g., batch user transactions on OP and execute them together on Mainnet Flashbots SUAVE chain on Bedrock More derivatives and structured products; interest rate derivatives (a la swivel/ipor), volatility derivatives (volmex), forex derivatives Ways to get more yield out of liquid staking (so all that liquid staked value comes to OP), e.g. leveraged staking, synthetic leveraged tokens. I think this could make an enormous difference in capital flows.   NFTs Onchain pricing / oracles for NFTs. Pretty much all pricing on NFTs uses some sort of centralized service. This is probably one of many examples of NFT infrastructure still being in its early stages, and we could pioneer a great deal of things. I know for a fact that there\u2019s been a lot of underappreciated innovation in this space by individual developers, and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in bringing them here. ",

He will be helping us to tackle many of the issues we see here on Optimism that still have yet to be solved over the course of 2023. When I look at the Optimism network I see a very nascent and premature NFT / Gaming sector with a ton of potential. Our goal here at Fractal Visions is to create a foundation type of framework within our own ecosystem to help support artists and educate them 1 on 1 when choosing deployment on Optimism based on prior knowledge about blockchain. The technology that this network provides is a great example of how blockchain technology works in a positive manner with existing systems currently in place in the world around us. Fractal Visions is adopting the values of the Optimism DAO, integrating the Public Goods ethos into the creative hub ecosystem, and provides educational content or 1 on 1 personal assistance and mentoring to help guide the way. We will continue to create a carbon copy of these types of morals based around creating a better world together and reiterate the intentions to educate others specifically about Public Goods! ",

                    "content": "Here are some of my current thoughts on various categories of grants that could help grow the # of users operating on Optimism: Liquidity Incentives: I think liquidity mining is OK but we need to be pretty cognizant of why we are granting the funds. Some considerations:  Will this incentives program lead to sticky usage? Specifically, why would this program be more effective than programs we\u2019ve funded in the past? Will this help bootstrap liquidity to a fledgling protocol that needs it?  Education: This category is very important given that the majority of potential L2 users might not know why Optimism is good, why L2s are the future, or how to use dapps like Velodrome/Synthetix/Lyra.  Having a robust education ecosystem lowers the friction to dive into a network. Potential grants:  sponsored educational content education creation competitions support for educational platforms/events (scavenger hunts like OP quests)    Awareness: One category not mentioned above but I think it\u2019s important. Some ideas:  Community meme competition on twitter Sponsoring local IRL meetups Best TikTok talking about Optimism or an OP-native dapp NFT-design competition (for some kind of quest)  It may sound silly but I\u2019ve seen these things work really well for web2 businesses. They drive engagement by the participants and increase the social proof of Optimism. Overall, I think we should bias towards experimentation this season, especially with smaller-sized grants. This is an iterative process and the more variety in grants we see now, the more data we\u2019ll have moving forward on what works best. Can\u2019t wait to see what happens! ",

We have about one mile of Gicl\u00e9e fine art canvas stockpiled and we are looking to donate this to some sort of awareness initiative for NFTs and blockchain technology via IRL events.  image4032\u00d73024 3.2 MB   image3024\u00d74032 2.16 MB  Take for example we have some Augmented Reality real estate properties we own located near the fountain of city park in front of the Denver Capital building, the front entry of the International Convention Center, and Red Rocks Amphitheater which is a live music venue and houses 12,000 people per event. It\u2019s always been a dream of ours to utilize these parcels of land to create an experience with our augmented fine art prints that leads into the educational side of blockchain technology with printed packets of educational information and interactive art. Maybe this year we can develop our concept a bit more. We have positioned ourselves to become educational leaders for NFT art and blockchain technology to some of the most well known visionary artists and musicians from around the world which I have personally met over the course of my traditional art career and formation of my fine art printing business which has served over 400 different artists from around the globe. The transition from a traditional art business with blockchain integration really makes sense as an actual real world use case we have been working together towards for the past few years here in the crypto space. Expenses for physical event spaces, travel, setup/breakdown labor costs, and physical print production are always the biggest barriers keeping us from accomplishing this.

Has anyone thought of a grant to help cryptoartists/defidegens who are trying to learn everything they can while building at the same time. I think it would be awesome to have a small grant that would help people like me who would love to have a little more time and options to learning how to code fullstack while at the same time just diving into the optimism world. I think it would be great to sort of get paid to learn. I know git hub has done similar things in the past, or so I\u2019ve heard with git, I would love to see this with OP. ",

                    "content": "These grants for growth are a great idea! This made me think about how we would apply at Fairmint and I wanted to share it with you. First, some context about Fairmint: Fairmint lets founders turn their community (users, customers, partners\u2026) into investors by letting them buy or earn equity directly from their website, at any single time (in a fully SEC-compliant way). Fairmint is made for non-crypto people (\u201cnormies\u201d), this is why you won\u2019t find any mention of blockchain or smart-contracts in our website\u2026 However, our backend is completely crypto-based: equity is represented by an ERC20 token, a market contract handles the issuance rules (price / valuation etc\u2026) and a compliance contract handles the transfer restriction rules (that\u2019s equity we\u2019re talking about, so there are restrictions :)). We\u2019re now 100% committed to Optimism and want to contribute to making Optimism thrive. Fairmint started on Ethereum but we recently switched to Optimism. Since our launch in November, any new Fairmint customer is now an Optimism user, issuing tokens on Optimism that represent their equity and every new investor landed by our customers de factor becomes an Optimism user  Fairmint\u2019s app is fully automated and we\u2019re starting to scale so a Growth grant would be perfect timing for Fairmint. Most likely, the way we\u2019d use it would be to reward our customers (reward amount tbd). To claim their amount, we would make our customers go through a small educative flow that let them know about Ethereum, Optimism, how Fairmint leverages it before giving them the ability to claim their tokens. So we would use the grant approximately like this (obviously the exact percentages would depend on the grant amount):  [10-20]%  of the grant to create a beautiful education + token claiming flow (including the legal required for the claiming flow). [80-90]%  of the grant for customers reward  We think such a use would benefit greatly Fairmint and the Optimism ecosystem in general. Looking forward to being able to do that  ",
