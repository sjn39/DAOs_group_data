                    "content": " Overview A week ago the executive spell to increase the Surplus Buffer from 4MM to 10MM got executed. Until now the System Surplus has grown to 5MM. At the time of the last Signal Request the SB/DAI-ratio was at ~0.33%, by the time we reach a System Surplus of 10MM the ratio will be at 0.63% (assuming we stick to a total DAI of 1.6B) Aside from usual risk mitigation (where we might have probably at least 2%), we are seeing a lot of conversations around the increased ETH-exposure circling around that we should not (only) think about raising the Stability Fee for ETH-A, but also about increasing the Surplus Buffer. We are still 5-7 weeks away until the Surplus Buffer is full again (depending on extra income through Liquidation Penalties, PSM fees, adjustments on the SF\u2026), but I don\u2019t think it is too early to make a decision about raising the Surplus Buffer again. If we want to raise it, it would be nice to do that before the MKR-burning starts again. We have to decide on two things regarding this topic:  How high do we want to set the Surplus Buffer Do we want to put all the fees into the Surplus Buffer or do we want to slowly lerp it so some of the fees get into the MKR-burning  To make it more tangible, I added some tables. Please bear in mind, that the fees might go up (and down) based on vault-utilization, Stability Fee changes - so I based the tables on the current state of the System (1.6B DAI, 2.38% average fees) Let\u2019s start with the Surplus Buffer itself. Assuming we stick to 1.6B we would end up with the following ratios:     Surplus Buffer in MM Surplus Buffer/DAI     10 0.63%   15 0.94%   20 1.25%   25 1.56%   30 1.88%    Now looking at the effects on increasing the Surplus Buffer. The two dimensions are: how much do we want to increase it, how much of the fees accrued shall be used for MKR burning. This result is the amount of weeks it would need to get the Surplus Buffer getting filled. Please bear in mind that Weeks until SB filled up counts from the point in time where we reached the current (10 MM) Surplus Buffer. The guestimate about the weeks is probably pretty conservative and might be a bit lower (due to more DAI in circulation or higher Stability Fees).     Increase Surplus Buffer by MM MKR Burn Fraction Weeks until SB filled up     5 0% 3.7   5 25% 4.9   5 50% 7.3   5 75% 14.6   10 0% 7.3   10 25% 9.8   10 50% 14.6   10 75% 29.3   15 0% 11.0   15 25% 14.6   15 50% 22.0   15 75% 43.9   20 0% 14.6   20 25% 19.5   20 50% 29.3   20 75% 58.6    (spreadsheet to clone)  Increasing the Surplus  Buffer Pros:  likelihood of flopping new MKR in a \u201ctoo much bad-debt\u201d-event gets decreased I hope we feel a bit better about keeping up with the DAI-demand without going crazy on SFs.  Cons:  DAI in SB is DAI taken out of circulation (probably not a big issue anymore, the supply side is elastic due to the PSM) no / less MKR burning  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     10 MM (no change) 15 MM (+5 MM) 20 MM (+10 MM) 25 MM (+15 MM) 30 MM (+20 MM) Abstain     0 voters      How much of the fees should go into the MKR burning? Pros:  We burn some MKR again  Cons:  It takes longer for the Surplus Buffer to get filled (see tables above on the effect)  Please note that the actual % cannot get guaranteed, as we would basically just calculate the end-date before adding it to the exec - if we accrue a lot of more fees than expected the burn-ratio will go up, if we accrue less, the ratio will go down. Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     0% 25% 50% 75% Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until February 11th; its outcome will result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

                    "content": "Just to contextualize my vote. 30+ M minimum.   I would fill it at 100% revenue at this point but am ok with any option < 100% going to MKR burn, and my order preference is 0, 25, 50, 75 in the poll.  (for some reason the poll wording got me).  Use part of the treasury to set a price floor to buy MKR at (at least 500 now).  Once this fills continue to burn MKR. I have an alternate idea.   Build treasury/reserve and start putting this extra cash into instruments that provide return and use that return to burn MKR since this preserves revenue as investments (cash or cash like stuff - stablecoins in DeFI vaults earning something) and will steady out MKR burn at a lower level (don\u2019t care the price in this situation as we are then banking all revenue to earn additional return while retaining liquidity if possible). This gives the system  reserves building via revenue which can also be used in a liquidity emergency. more consistent return to burn MKR with to build long term consistent MKR burn even at significantly reduce levels. provides more liquidity into DeFI markets reducing farming returns on DAI, also reducing demand. a reserve fund that can be used to set a MKR price floor to buy when MKR price drops vs. buying when price is high, and potentially selling (if even possible) when price is low. supports the ecosystem and multiple protocols earns governance tokens from other systems that can either be used with Maker governance to affect what these other protocols are doing or just convert to MKR and burned.  We need to start thinking beyond strictly burning MKR and building multiple tiers of buffers and funding sources.  Maker has many good problems once we get even 10% of our reserves earning 2-3-5-10% in DeFI and reducing returns for everyone else we can get demand under control and maybe many of our real problems under control.   We can then build a real steady MKR burn that costs us only our profits on our treasury - not locking capital away from markets but exposing it to them (keeping liquidity out there).  With such a model we protect MKR from being diluted with large and growing surplus/reserve/treasury tiers.  We bank money not just to be able to commit to core groups, and people not just for 2-3 years but for 10-20.  We can also pay salaries that won\u2019t just attract good people, but the best the brightest, the cream of the defi crop. It might take 1-2 years to get to the 10% mark of surplus/reserve capacity and we don\u2019t have to eliminate burn entirely just reduce it (to say 50-25% even) but once we get there we will have people, cash, probably a much higher MKR price, and a much more robust Maker DAO that hopefully isn\u2019t struggling with much other than thinking about how to expand markets\u2026 BTW:  with SF avg running 4-5% on 2B we are banking 80-100M/yr (6-8M/month) and I consider this to be a likely scenario within as little as 3 months at current rate of growth.  Maker could be at 3B or higher by end of year with SFs on that 4-5% (120-150M or 10-12M/month).   Lets try not to piss away all of this revenue just on MKR burn but expanding system security, and talent. Get a salary closer to 150K/yr+ and a commitment even for 5 years and I might quit my day job and come and work for MKR full time.   Others might need a bit more actually (our key smart contracts folks imo - my California and other high income area peers making 200-250K or higher). Imagine if you will a MKR system with 200M (or 10%) reserves (mostly stablecoins in LP with 100% or good liquidity) earning even 5% we could then burn 10M/yr of MKR without losing any cash reserves.  Do this at a even a 50% rate and we will have burned 200M worth of MKR and will use the other 200M to burn at 10M of MKR per year as long as 5% returns on the reserves hold.  Reduce the chance of having to worry about minting and selling MKR to deal with a loss event to near 0 permanently. ",

It is also why I distinctly refer to a reserve vs. the surplus as the surplus is connected intimately with collateral and balancing the system.  Once pulled from the surplus this DAI while part of the system (and can demand assets in an ES) would require a governance vote to be put back in to \u2018cover\u2019 anything.  It is capital (or if you like debt notes) effectively pulled from the system (vat, vaults) but is completely collateralized.

If the markets can\u2019t handle even 2% we have other liquidity problems. Also this is precisely the reason to build reserves by exchanging this DAI (freeing it into markets) for USDC, TUSD, GUSD, god knows what else raising funds to build a treasury/reserve that should have decent DAI liquidity especially when markets are dropping.  I think a DAI surplus of something at a minimum of 2% isn\u2019t going to kill these markets.  And if they want to drop USDC or other stablecoins to mint DAI into the PSM take the fee give them the DAI and move on. @cmooney as you know I started here with Maker asking about how we deal with DAI liquidity generally.  I harp on it constantly.   We added USDC (starting as a emergency) now have tons of stablecoins (like or not like).  Governance went to LR101 vaults to get PEG to 1.01 (500M worth).  Now switching to PSM (that probably needs an IAM to manage DC liquidity with 500M).  Governance probably needs to raise the DC on the emergency USDC-B to handle emergencies (the system needs at least 5-10% of the outstanding dai as available liquidity at all times under varying terms vaults/rates/whatever). I think the markets can easily find 10% liquidity here - virtually in a single block if done right (I wondered what defines the most DAI liquidity that could be sourced in a single block tx via flash loans etc.). This is another reason in our largest collateral vault classes to have a sequence of vaults with different SF, DC, LR.   To provide emergency buffers for collateral in case DCs on the normal vaults get exhausted quickly and needs more DAI (so DC is there waiting for them in more profitable and/or less risky vaults).  THis has the added benefit of spreading out Liquidation Risk into different LR/CR bands as well and I will continue to encourage adoption of this for ETH in particular, wBTC second. ",

I believe a more correct metric for that is the stability fees owed but not recovered yet, I think that is what makerburn shows here : makerburn880\u00d7163 29.8 KB I believe the buffer should be something between 0 and this number.

Keg is on the horizon, strategic reserve is in discussion - but none of this is in place right now if Maker would be a traditional company nobody would expect a share-buyback or similar. We should invest as much money as possible on growth. If we start failing on spending money: start burning MKR. as long as this is not the case: don\u2019t burn. we constantly struggle with increasing the debt exposure, raising the fees is nice for the profit, but bad for the growth. I know the increased SB is not helping right now, but it surely is not helping if we start burning again - even if this is just a fraction of the fees. we can easily reduce the SB again as soon as there is something better in place, but right now we should make sure to put everything in there. don\u2019t even burn 25% of it.

The buy & burn is quite useless and I would note that we get the best price increase when we are not burning \u2026 If needed (market crash), we can always buy&burn later (but we need a surplus buffer for that) 2- The Yearn incident shows that you can lose $10M quite easily and suddenly. 90% of the value of Maker is the trust that DAI holders give us. Not signaling 0% burning strongly is choosing farming behavior over growth. The risk exposure is growing faster than our surplus buffer. I don\u2019t want us to artificially limit our growth. I feel bullish tonight. Let\u2019s hit 10B DAI end of this year. @Aaron_Bartsch, @alexis has almost 10 MIPs to put idle USDC at work, I also have crazy ideas and DAI bonds are coming.  RWAs are coming as well. Really what we need is more DAI issuance, not MKR burn. ",

In the last signal about the SB, there was a rough consensus that we should first flap some MKR. As of now we burned almost 2k of MKR already bringing is under 1MM MKR supply again  The SB should protect the system against bad debt, my feeling is that having just ~0.33% of coverage is not high enough. There are some interesting conversations around automatically increasing the SB, but I think we should not wait for them to resolve in an implementation. Please also note that increasing the SB is also revertable - if we for some reason decide that the SB needs to get lowered, we can do that the same way as we do the increases.  Pros:  likelihood of flopping new MKR in a \u201ctoo much bad-debt\u201d-event gets decreased maybe also allows us to experiment more with lower liquidation-ratio vault-types like WBTC-B backed by B.Protocol    Cons:  DAI in SB is DAI taken out of circulation  no more flapping as long as the SB is not filled if we combine this with the lerp we can stretch the filling of the SB over a longer period so a fraction of the surplus goes into the buffer while the other fraction goes into flapping  Currently we generate ~19 MM fees per year. Assuming we stick to this  Adjust the Surplus Buffer to       4 MM (no change)     6 MM (+ 2MM / + 50% / ~5 weeks without flap)     8 MM (+ 4MM / + 100% / ~ 11 weeks without flap)     10 MM (+ 6 MM / +150% / ~ 16 weeks without flap)     Abstain       0 voters      shall we lerp it and if yes how much should should get burned? Lerping: increase the SB over time so we can burn MKR and increase SB simultaneously. Upside of lerping: a fraction of the fees can still get used for MKR burning. Downside: it takes longer to fill the SB     Burn 75% (4x the time to fill the SB) Burn 50% (2x the time to fill the SB) Burn 25% (1.5x the time to fill the SB) Burn 0% (as above) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will run until January 14th and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome the poll deems it necessary.

The author argues that this amount is not high enough to protect the system against bad debt and proposes increasing the SB to 6 MM, 8 MM, or 10 MM. The post also discusses the possibility of \"lerping\" the increase in the SB over time and burning MKR simultaneously. The post invites feedback and questions from third parties and will run a poll until January 14th to determine the next steps.",

And we all expect to increase our exposure next year, not decrease it right? We currently generate $20M of revenues per year for a $1B DAI exposure. I want to pause growth unnecessarily (like waiting for capital generation because we were too greedy) until $1B annual revenues. I understand you want to increase MKR price but burning shares is the solution when you have nothing better to do. MKR price = (revenues - expenses) * PER / #MKR (with PER = price earning ratio (market dependant)) Expenses will come in 2021 so increasing revenues is mathematically a better solution than decreasing the number of MKR shares thanks to operational leverage. And to increase revenues we need to increase the surplus buffer. ",

If you think the loss will come from USDC, that\u2019s good. In September, @Primoz showed that with a base case scenario the 350M ETH-A might generate an average loss of 14M DAI (23.5M for a VaR 99.9%). Probably, this isn\u2019t perfect, but the parameters make sense. Now the problem is obviously just bigger (even before adding ETH-B, YFI and a tail risk). No one wants to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going. But you can feel how that will end if the bull market stop. Removing USDC from the PSM vault will be easy (we are all working on that with RWA and farming collaterals). Generating surplus not so, that takes time (I take for granted that we don\u2019t want to issue MKR). ",

I am not sure. We have experience that when SHTF, MKR value drops significantly: e.g., during Black Thursday it went from 600usd to 200usd in 1day. This drop occurred even before any MKR mint. So we had to print new MKR (about ~8000 IIRC) at historical lows. In this sense, having the surplus in DAI seems to offer a more predictable layer of protection. Because the \u2018hole\u2019 generated by bad events is denominated by unbacked DAIs, not by MKRs. [Or at least, this is my understanding. I am happy to be corrected.] ",

Being used by financial institutions is the key to go from 1B DAI to 100B DAI. Assuming a 2% interest rate, you can figure out what that means for the $MKR price.  The stablecoin arrangement should have appropriate systems, controls, and practices in place to manage these risks, including to safeguard reserve assets. Strong reserve management practices include ensuring a 1:1 reserve ratio and adequate financial resources to absorb losses and meet liquidity needs  @alexis The crop join is coming soon. No longer we will have idle assets. The buffer the surplus buffer, the higher our safety, the higher also the DAI demand which will lead to more yielding assets i.e. higher revenues. ",

So the money is there. I tried to make an illustration below (data thanks to https://www.mkranalytics.com/ ). The purple line is our leverage ratio (assets, i.e. DAI loans / capital, i.e. surplus buffer). We are currently at 0.3% which is ten times lower than what banks need to have (but we are not having the same assets). If we keep this level it will only decrease (the blue line is a forecast for DAI supply using the last poll on the subject). Black Thursday didn\u2019t go well with a 0.4% leverage ratio and I\u2019m guessing we have riskier assets now. If half of the revenues (a bit below $1M per month) are used to increase the surplus buffer we will more or less be flat which is the minimum to be serious. I\u2019m not against spending money on growth, but you can\u2019t spend what you have used to buyback MKR tokens. I\u2019m fully open to spending $1M per month on growth. image857\u00d7491 27.1 KB @alexis Thanks for those kind words on the surplus buffer not being filled with DAI  Actually, it is still a reserve, and using something like strategic reserves is probably not the best solution.

The initial plan is that MKR dilution will cover inadequate liquidations. This is what occurred after BT (the 0-bid auction winners is a separate issue). I agree that a buffer against too frequent MKR dilution is acceptable (although I also wouldn\u2019t mind no buffer at all and everyone getting used to constant MKR minting offseting some of the burn), but my intuition is that forcing the buffer to play a backstop role for larger and larger black swans would stifle our growth and make us complacent (while regular MKR minting would keep us on our toes). Compare the amount of DAI loans in existence and our revenue; whether you add none of the revenue or all of it to the SB, you are not significantly protecting the system. On the other hand growth is crucial at the moment and every resource spent to that effect matters a lot. ",

The definition of INVNs is as broad as any distributed database system. It got me wondering whether: 1/ participating in an existing INVN as a node AND/OR 2/ inviting banks to join an existing INVN as a node is enough of a \u201cticket\u201d for Maker to be allowed issuance of stablecoins in a same level playing field as other charted banks?  Any reading clarifying this question is appreciated.  As discussed below, INVNs and related stablecoins represent new technological means of carrying out bank-permissible payment activities. We therefore conclude that a bank may validate, store, and record payments transactions by serving as a node on an INVN.  ",

We should raise the Surplus Buffer to 10M for a multitude of reasons:   With the current Dai supply of 1.3B and hyper-reflexive markets where tokens can pump or dump 30%+ in a day we are at severe risk of losses on liquidating collateral when the market contracts. Keep in mind liquidations 2.0 hasn\u2019t been released yet so the risk of a 0-bidder is still there.   Part of the transition of shutting down the Foundation and handing over responsibilities to the DAO means extra expenses the DAO will have to takeover. These include things like:    Domain Teams Oracle Feed Stipends (26,000 DAI / month) gas payments for relayers (variable based on gas cost and number of Oracles)    We have been seeing consistent 0-bidders on surplus auctions (daiauctions.com). Looking at the auction participants in these auctions, they look to fairly capital constrained meaning if a large amount of surplus auctions were to kicked off at once they would not have the capital to bid on all of them. Given the volatility in the market right now, and the risk for a large pullback, there is a chance that a large amount of liquidations could occur, which would generate a large amount of liquidation penalties, and subsequently trigger mass surplus auctions at the same time.   Now that the MKR price is higher, burning tokens isn\u2019t as attractive anymore.   ",

The problem is how to avoid unnecessary liquidations (the liquidations like on BT that caused us $5M+ of realized loss and $100M+ of loss of potential profit). The goal is to use the underwater vaults as our reserve when appropriate. One way is to introduce another ETH oracle that would complement the current oracle. It could work like this: If the liquidations are \u201cnormal\u201d - i.e. happening at near market price and not producing loss/excessive surplus depletion: use the normal oracle. If the liquidations are not \u201cnormal\u201d - use the \u201cETH permabull/buy the dip/hodl\u201d oracle which returns \u201call time high\u201d ETH price ($1400) from the last bull market which was at least 2 years ago. That should be tweaked so that it does not cause problems when the price crashes from $2000 to $1500\u2026 People have confidence staking ETH to a contract that has no way to get the funds back yet (for X years possibly), but we are treating ETH like a hot potato that should be disposed of as soon as possible. Yes, we are in the stablecoin business, but we are doing the business on the ETH blockchain. People will not get their collateral back if something terrible happens to the ETH blockchain. Even if we managed to start the ES in time, the execution will be a mess (that\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing testing the ES in the production). EDIT: Is it possible to stop/pause all vault liquidations in progress with one executive vote and no delay? ",

The poll has seen significant attention, with 64 voters at time of writing. The poll shows a majority outcome, with voters favouring an increase to a 10M surplus buffer. Risk and other mandated actors have shown strong support for an increase.  Given the lerp poll is inconclusive, and with the plurality favouring no use of the new lerp functionality, this part of the poll will not be moving on-chain and the lerp functionality will not be used in this instance.

                    "content": " Overview Last time we raised the Surplus Buffer we had around 1.6B total DAI and by raising the Surplus Buffer to 30 MM we managed to almost match a ratio of 2% of Surplus Buffer / total DAI. Since then, a good Billion of new DAI was generated, bringing our ratio back to 1.15% again (and we haven\u2019t even filled the Surplus Buffer yet). We still have a couple of weeks left until the Surplus Buffer is reached (60 days according to makerburn.com) - but as we need to be at least at 2%, we should prepare to make another move here again. We have to decide on two things regarding this topic:  How high do we want to set the Surplus Buffer Do we want to put all the fees into the Surplus Buffer or do we want to slowly lerp it so some of the fees get into the MKR-burning  To make it more tangible, I added some tables. Please bear in mind, that the fees might go up (and down) based on vault-utilization, Stability Fee changes - so I based the tables on the current state of the System (2.6B DAI, 3.75% average fees) Assuming we stay at the current 2.6B DAI (and the chances it keeps growing are pretty good) we would end up with the following ratios:     Surplus Buffer in MM Surplus Buffer/DAI        30 (current setting) 1.15%      50 1.92%      60 2.31%      70 2.69%      80 3.08%       Now looking at the effects on increasing the Surplus Buffer. The two dimensions are: how much do we want to increase it, how much of the fees accrued shall be used for MKR burning. This result is the amount of weeks it would need to get the Surplus Buffer getting filled. Please bear in mind that Weeks until SB filled up counts from the point in time where we reached the current (30 MM) Surplus Buffer. The guestimate about the weeks is probably pretty conservative and might be a bit lower (due to more DAI in circulation or higher Stability Fees).     Surplus Buffer in MM Increase Surplus Buffer by MM MKR Burn Fraction Weeks until SB filled up      50 20 0% 10.7    50 20 25% 14.2    50 20 50% 21.3    50 20 75% 42.7    60 30 0% 16.0    60 30 25% 21.3    60 30 50% 32.0    60 30 75% 64.0    70 40 0% 21.3    70 40 25% 28.4    70 40 50% 42.7    70 40 75% 85.3    80 50 0% 26.7    80 50 25% 35.6    80 50 50% 53.3    80 50 75% 106.7     (spreadsheet to clone)  Increasing the Surplus  Buffer Update: please have a look at the details provided by @SebVentures and @Primoz Pros:  likelihood of flopping new MKR in a \u201ctoo much bad-debt\u201d-event gets decreased I hope we feel a bit better about keeping up with the DAI-demand without going crazy on SFs.  Cons:  DAI in SB is DAI taken out of circulation (probably not a big issue anymore, the supply side is elastic due to the PSM) no / less MKR burning  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     30 MM (no change) 50 MM (+20 MM) 60 MM (+30 MM) 70 MM (+40 MM) 80 MM (+50 MM) Abstain     0 voters      How much of the fees should go into the MKR burning? 0%: no lerping, the Surplus Buffer will be directly set to the target value. No MKR burning. >0%: we slowly increase the Surplus Buffer over time to try to burn some of the Surplus. Pros:  We burn some MKR again  Cons:  It takes longer for the Surplus Buffer to get filled (see tables above on the effect, up to 4x)  Please note that the actual % cannot get guaranteed, as we would basically just calculate the end-date before adding it to the exec - if we accrue a lot of more fees than expected the burn-ratio will go up, if we accrue less, the ratio will go down (maybe even to 0). Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     0% 25% 50% 75% Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-04-01T13:00:00Z; its outcome will result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Aside from MKR holders not seeing their token go up in value, is there any objective reason to care about a delay to reignite the MKR burn?   So when I bring up using lerp, I\u2019m also thinking about long term MKR value, not just short term. The benefit of mixing a bit of burning is that the protocol gets to burn over a longer time period. Possibility of being able to burn more MKR in the long term instead of waiting to max out. Assumptions:  A 30MM DAI buffer doesn\u2019t present an existential risk to Maker, but we\u2019d still be committed to growing surplus reserves. Once we get an 80MM buffer, MKR will be a lot safer. Price might be a lot higher. May result in less MKR burned.  We\u2019ll see what the Risk team has to say about how dangerous the current reserves are. The SB isn\u2019t the only thing regarding protocol safety. Bigger impact is the risk exposure from vaults and the robustness of the liquidations system. So great steps forward with Liquidations 2.0 underway. And also had some recent improvements to the current liquidation system with a higher \u2018beg\u2019 on some vaults, meaning less risk of loss. And a 2x in throughput of the liquidation system. 30MM DAI \u2192 60MM DAI in 12 hours. Anyways this isn\u2019t a binding poll, we could always resignal to start lerping when we get more System Surplus. And with the future growth of the DAI supply maybe it\u2019s fine to not start burning until next year. ",

                    "content": "Regarding increasing the Surplus Buffer, this post provides some risk and business-related elements elaborated by @Primoz and myself. Feel free to ask more questions. In short, we are advocating to increase the Surplus Buffer to 2.5% and 5% of Maker\u2019s RWA (risk weighted assets), e.g. something between 70M and 80M xxM. Nevertheless, each community participant should take an informed decision. At the end of the day, it is a business decision on how much risk MKR holders want to take. Here are some data points you could consider: Risk-weighted assets One way to objectivize the risk of the protocol is to use the leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is surplus buffer/assets (all loans). This is around 0.5% right now. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t take into account the underlying risk of each asset type. Indeed, holding some USDC isn\u2019t risky except on the tail events (regulatory ban of USDC on Maker Protocol). ETH-B is strictly riskier than ETH-A or ETH-C. Additionally, we currently face a lack of Keepers for Uniswap LP vaults making them risky (as we can have 0 bids). A better way to think about risk is to use a risk-weighted approach when each asset is weighted by a risk factor. This is called Core Equity Tier (CET1) 1 ratio in the real-world. The bank regulation set the minimum level of the leverage ratio to 3% and the CET1 ratio to 4.5% but those are not necessarily adequate to evaluate the risk of MakerDAO.  Chart1200\u00d7742 49.5 KB  Real-world assets (MIP21 and MIP22) Currently, both MIP21 and MIP22 are quite aggressive regarding loan impairment. Indeed, they all start with a soft liquidation that is transferred to a hard liquidation after a delay (MIP21) or after a governance decision (MIP22). When the hard liquidation is triggered all the remaining tab (debt) is declared as sin which decreases the Surplus Buffer and might lead to MKR minting. This is not necessarily a good representation of the reality and it might well be that most of the loan will be recovered in the future (days, weeks, months, \u2026). Nevertheless, that\u2019s the best solution at this stage. For this reason, it could be safer to have a Surplus Buffer at least the size of the biggest RWA vault loan. Regulatory risks It might well be that regulations about stablecoin will be enacted in the future. One is MiCa (European regulation on stablecoin that apply also on USD-pegged stablecoins) which requires a 2% leverage ratio. Should this regulation apply in 2024, it might cut us from EU-based exchanges/centralized products. If the bank regulation is taken (Basel iii), the minimum leverage ratio should be 3%. This might be the case with the STABLE Act (US-based) that requires stablecoin issuers to apply for a bank license. Again non-compliance might cut us from most US-business. MakerDAO is currently far from being regulated under those legislations. Moreover, there are plenty of other rules that MakerDAO doesn\u2019t match (meaning having a proper Surplus Buffer doesn\u2019t solve everything). Nevertheless, in case such capital levels are needed, it would take significant time to reach those objectives (assuming we don\u2019t want to dilute MKR holders). On MKR burn lerp If the community decides on a surplus buffer size as adequate for the community risk appetite, it doesn\u2019t make objective sense to delay aching the goal by burning MKR. Nevertheless, the need to burn some MKR along the way might be needed for PR. At this stage, we are generating $100M of revenues annually from lending and we could forecast around $30M of operating expenses annually (Core Units mainly). This lead to a Surplus Buffer increase of around $6M/month. Impact of the Surplus Buffer on the MKR earnings The Surplus Buffer is on the liability side. It is therefore not resources we can use for anything per se. Nevertheless, assuming the demand of DAI to be constant no matter the size of the Surplus Buffer, the only impact would be the size of PSM-USDC-A. This is not an earning asset yet, but some MIPs are proposing to use those USDC in a more lucrative way. At this stage, and even without earnings, the level of the Surplus Buffer doesn\u2019t impact significantly the MKR return on investment. Indeed, if the Surplus Buffer is 1% of MKR market cap, the impact on earning is 1%. Competitive landscape Without going into much detail, the existence and the level of the Surplus Buffer is a key element of the value proposition of DAI. USDC, PAX (incl. BUSD and HUSD) don\u2019t have Surplus Buffer equivalents in their design. Nevertheless USDC has a surplus of assets of 0.5% of the issued USDC currently. Moreover, their investments are risk-free assets (T-Bills and FDIC-guaranteed banks deposit mainly). DAI has a Surplus Buffer but also has more risky assets (crypto-backed loans mainly, RWA soon). This provides a much better return for MKR holders but DAI might want a share of the cake (as they take some of the risks). DAI holders also don\u2019t get $ convertibility. This might lead to a needed increase of the DSR to compete with USDC-like stablecoin if we can\u2019t be better on some other aspects. Other competitors in the future can be lending platforms (CeFi like BlockFi or DeFi like Compound). They might want to issue a stablecoin to decrease their funding cost and increase profits. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the DeFi space currently doesn\u2019t care as shown in the USDT case and the existence of algorithmic stablecoins like FRAX. Risk of having a big Surplus Buffer As designed currently the surplus buffer belongs to DAI holders at the emergency shutdown of the DAI Protocol (as discussed here). The limit of the Surplus Buffer (before game theory suggests triggering an Emergency Shutdown) is hard to define and depends on the quality and liquidity of the collateral that can be retrieved. Intuitively, you can say that the Surplus Buffer shouldn\u2019t be above a few percents of the DAI outstanding. Solutions to this problem are either:  Using the mandated actors multi-sig (which require significant trust in the mandated actors) to store excess funds (above 1% Surplus Buffer) Implementing Strategic Reserves (which demands SC work) Finding a solution to have residual collaterals (after all DAI holders are given $1 of collateral) given to MKR holders (or mandated multisig or Strategic Reserves) after an Emergency Shutdown. Probably hard to solve.  The first two solutions are not perfect as nothing guarantees MKR holders will refund DAI holders if they get less than $1 at Emergency Shutdown. Risk premiums and VaR According to the latest risk premiums table, the weighted risk premium for MakerDAO\u2019s portfolio is about 6%. This means expected losses per year would amount to about 115m on a portfolio of 1.9bn (excluding stablecoins). This metric is however based on the Liquidations 1.2. Further, the 99% VaR value from Andy\u2019s presentation in January measured about 10% of debt exposure (again excluding stablecoins). Applying this to today\u2019s debt levels, 99% VaR would likely amount to around 200m. Again this number doesn\u2019t assume implementation of Liquidations 2.0 and its positive effect on expected and tail event losses. Assuming huge improvement with Liq 2.0 we could say that the reasonable amount of Surplus Buffer would be between 50m and 100m (also depends on the community\u2019s confidence interval to be hedged against worst case losses, in other words what % of VaR is chosen). This potential range of Surplus value would represent between 2.5% and 5% of Maker\u2019s RWA (risk weighted assets) and would be also somehow in line with Basel recommendations for banks. Conclusion Assuming a middleground figure of 75m targeted Surplus Buffer and net income of 6m per month (after DAOs costs), we would need to wait until the end of 2021 to get Surplus Buffer to target levels. This also means no MKR burning in 2021 at this pace of net income. From MKR holders perspective the issue really lies in current inability to achieve some minimum safe yield on Surplus Buffer assets (currently Surplus Buffer counterparty is non-interest yielding USDC in the PSM). Imagine a 5-10% yield that would be achieved on a 75m of Surplus Buffer. We therefore think that from a risk perspective a Surplus Buffer of 70m to 80m would be preferred going forward with no burning or a minimum amount of burning (25%) if we are able to make yield on Surplus Buffer assets by implementing strategic reserves or similar type of treasury management concept.

I would suggest to get working on one of the first two in the list as I have been advocating for SR pretty much since I came to Maker.   I have also been advocating for a minimum of 1% SB forever which we still have not reached.   To put this in perspective BT cost the protocol about 4% of total outstanding which at the time was something like 150M if I remember right.   4% of 2.7B is now 100M which if you believe the MKR price will only drop 50% would mean a dilution of about 100K (or 10%). BTW:  Regarding negative MKR event like BT I realized Maker could have done a 10%/yr bond offer and saved itself something like 5M and not diluted one MKR.   This would have been paid off in about 6 months.   So again I would urge research into different DSR facilities that could be used during liquidation events to backstop the system and or to offer up as longer term deposit facilities (which could pay out against and manage interest rate fluctuations against longer term loans capturing interest rate deposit loan spreads - think RWA here).

Lets say the worst happens and we used the buffer and also need to use mkr to cover the loans. And the shock of just not having enough buffer would drive mkr price down even more and we be auctioning mkr for less then what it is to buy back  the dai. If we had a buffer and also burning a % of the fees we have a strong mkr also. So in a event of failure we can apply bought measures if needed. say an 75% buffer  and 25% mkr model. Having a buffer and doing nothing is putting money and losing value.  I like to share this idea. ",

Unfortunately being open to this sort of compromise opens up ambiguity over how Facilitators should set the compromise value. In this case, those voting at 0% may not want or accept a compromise value because their reasons for voting 0% may not be related to the relative amount of burn. They may be opposed to burn on a general level, or disagree with the proposed method. If the leading options were 25% and 50% this would be safer, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to allow  governance facilitators to choose compromise options in the general case.

Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on us. Having a faster filled and higher Surplus Buffer provides optionality. If the market crashes and our Surplus Buffer is in excess of undercollateralized vaults, we can strategically buy back and burn MKR at basement bargain prices. Following this strategy we reduce risk in diluting ourselves at unfavorable prices which should be a priority. Let\u2019s also not forget that we are in the midst of onboarding the first CUs and without any treasury, funds must effectively come from the Surplus Buffer.

The example for this would be, turn off the surplus buffer if/when annual MKR burn =>5%. The other concern that not supporting the price through burns brings up is that if people aren\u2019t buying and the MKR price is too low, this can create existential security risks to the protocol (as attackers can accumulate MKR cheaply to takeover governance), therefore it can be argued that some amount of burn/price support is warranted.

Can you imagine if BTC was at $60k but its hashrate was still at 2015 levels?     Aes:  Having a faster filled and higher Surplus Buffer provides optionality. If the market crashes and our Surplus Buffer is in excess of undercollateralized vaults, we can strategically buy back and burn MKR at basement bargain prices.   This would provide a great long-term option. Unfortunately, however, the risk of needing the Surplus Buffer is higher when MKR price is lower. When the system\u2019s liabilities are at their largest is also when MKR needs to be at its peak. We absolutely can\u2019t underallocate on the Surplus Buffer. But if MKR is too underpriced then a governance attack becomes a reality. What\u2019s the balance between the two? I don\u2019t know.

Mature banks are usually close to book value (x0.5-x2). The same will apply to Maker at some point. Obviously, we are far from that in DeFi, it will take years for the competition to mature. Using capital to buy MKR actually decreases BVPS as MKR is $2100 and BV is $20. It is not saying that burning MKR when the price is low is a bad idea. We need to create $2080 of BVPS to justify the price (let\u2019s assume x1 to ease the math). It may make sense to start by decreasing (or not increasing it) BVPS first in order to decrease the number of MKR, then it will be easier to increase BVPS. There is at least $1B of profit to generate (and store) to justify the current price (assuming BVPS x2 because we have a \u201csuperior management\u201d).

Our growth prospects alone put us in a different category.   It brings a different light. My point is that when you need to add billions to the surplus buffer (or whatever it will be called in the future) to justify the current market valuation in 10 years, you don\u2019t care about spending a few millions on buyback. Apple is not a good example because its balance sheet doesn\u2019t really matter for its business. I would point out that they keep 5% of their market cap, or 3 years of expenses without profit, as cash (which is stupid to me but who knows). Something like yearn or Aave, asset managers, doesn\u2019t need capital for instance. Their business model is to take e.g. 10% of the yield they generate to users. A user puts $1M, Yearn generates 12%, they keep 1.2%, the customer gets the rest. If they lose money, that\u2019s life. We are lending at 5% and our DAI holders get 0.01%. We pocket the big buck here 4.9% vs 1.9% of assets managers. This is because we put capital (and MKR issuance) at stake to cover any loss. Now if we are too reckless and don\u2019t pay them enough, they will just put the capital at Aave. Or to a competitor that will just fork Maker and be less greedy. It is clear to me that the goal is to have at least 1T DAI outstanding when DeFi will be mainstream. Assuming a 2% net interest margin that gives you 20B of net interest income. How to get there is what matters. Reducing the SB growth might be the fatal flaw at some point due to either a crash or competition that seems safer (not going to happen soon after the FEI mess). But the same can be said to not pumping the MKR price with buybacks regarding the governance issue. All I\u2019m saying is that if you use the short-term price of MKR as a motive, you might fail to achieve the end game. ",

Second it doesn\u2019t match the timing, what we would like to do it is to buy to protect the chief and fight against a cheap MKR. ",

I think its more than few weeks though, closer to two months actually but in reality it depends on DAO costs and liquidation income\u2026 This recommendation that we published with @SebVentures still holds (see full reply from Seb above):     SebVentures:  In short, we are advocating to increase the Surplus Buffer to 2.5% and 5% of Maker\u2019s RWA (risk weighted assets), e.g. something between 70M and 80M xxM. Nevertheless, each community participant should take an informed decision. At the end of the day, it is a business decision on how much risk MKR holders want to take.   This would put Surplus recommendation currently to 100m DAI and above (2.5% of about 4bn risk weighted assets). It probably also makes sense to start discussion whether we want to make something useful out of such large Surplus. Strategic reserves / treasury management should be one important topic going forward in my opinion. ",
