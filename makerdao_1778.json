September Ratification Polls: Outcomes We\u2019ve got six Formal Submissions for the September Governance Cycle; their Ratification Polls went up on September 12 and closed today on September 26 after a two-week run. Here\u2019s a summary of the outcomes:  The Strategic Happiness Core Unit offboarding was rejected. The MIP61 (Delegate Compensation) amendment that shortens the measurement period for delegate participation metrics passed. From now on, the shorter of 1) the previous 120 days or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate will be used to calculate participation metrics. The MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set that aimed to formalize the role of delegates and their compensation within the MIPs Framework was rejected. The 81k SPF to fund further work from the Ambassador Program team was accepted. GovAlpha\u2019s MKR budget passed. Its 1.5 multiplier option (330.27 Total MKR) was the winning option. GovAlpha\u2019s MKR budgets are semi-annual. StarkNet Engineering Core Unit\u2019s (SNE-001) MKR budget passed. It totals 810 MKR, with a one-off transfer of 270 MKR and a stream of 540 MKR ending on September 28, 2024.  And here\u2019s a table for good measure:     Proposal Summary Impact (?)
