                    "content": "Hi Everyone, As the Maker Foundation dissolution reaches its final stages, one of the remaining tasks is shutting down the Maker Rocket.chat channel by taking the databases offline. This means all the public chats (ie #general, #speculation etc\u2026), and conversations with other community members will be taken offline and become inaccessible after October 31, 2021. We recommend that any conversations a community member would like to keep should be screenshot or copy/pasted. The MakerDAO Community is tasked with exploring and/or deciding on a new communications platform (ex. Discord). Moreover, given certain legal obligations (related to the ongoing class action, for example) the Foundation is required to maintain the Rocket Chat channels and cannot \u201cpass\u201d the RC account or channels included therein to the community. Lastly, we understand the inconvenience this may cause for everyone and appreciate everyone\u2019s understanding. We hope that with a two-month headstart, the community can find a suitable replacement and transition to a new platform. If you have any questions, please contact Brian (@bri174) or Coulter (@Coulter). @LongForWisdom @prose11 ",

Like others have said, there are bots and moderation tools that can mitigate scammers and other riff raff. If we create permissioned rooms for the more regular community members we can still have the quality convos we are used to on RocketChat. As an added benefit, we will probably gain more community members as it lowers the barrier to entry. Sure, some will be passerbys with low-quality input, but with the permissioned rooms I don\u2019t see this being much of an issue.

Some have already pointed out that there is an issue on the Forum where there\u2019s people making useless posts just to earn cred. It\u2019s not widespread but does happen.

We had like 6 MKR addresses voting in that period. What about promoting the POAP thing with events, like MKR drops or something like this instead of silently shutting down the thing?

But only partially because I don\u2019t like the idea of sharing my Ethereum address in a forum. Somebody with access to it could check out my voting behaviour, or worse, how much MKR/ETH/tokens I have. This is not web3 in my opinion. I did like very much the Poap thing because it was something awarded via the Forum (old-internet), via a PM, but could be claimed by any 100% anonymous wallet of choice (web3) in xDai for free.     twblack88:  That\u2019s a @juan question   @juan could you please throw some MKR at POAP addresses?
