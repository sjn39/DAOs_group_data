                    "content": " General Updates  Gaming guilds and DAOs. Gaming guilds are gamers with the necessary funds and tools to play video games together and share data. Thanks to the appearance of various play-to-earn games, crypto gaming guilds have become the source of income for thousands of people worldwide. These guilds share their proceeds with the players, which are in the form of the native token of the game -not a stablecoin- exposing their players to the token\u2019s volatility. And that\u2019s how tokens as SLP have become quite popular in certain regions:  1600\u00d7523 448 KB  no Dai in the Philippines  1570\u00d7426 102 KB  SLP and Dai in Venezuela  1094\u00d7384 65.2 KB  Usually, SLP doesn\u2019t appear in other countries Although we have tried to convince these guilds to use DAI, not just for tournament prizes but to pay the players, they don\u2019t have an incentive to do it. And this is the same as what happens with other DAOs. So, what if we could create incentives for them to use Dai\u2026 as by accepting their tokens as collateral and giving them a convenient credit line. Until now, the collaterals in our system support Dai\u2019s supply, but would it be possible to think in collaterals that help us increase Dai demand?

                    "content": "Hi everyone. I would like to give a little context about YGG token and gaming guilds. Maybe most of you have heard about NFT games like Axie Infinity and how they are making a great impact in damaged economies like Phillipines, Argentina or Venezuela (where I live). This games introduced a whole new concept for the Play to Earn economies inside videogames, this by integrating the game with the blockchain techonology. On these days many games are little bit down on their economies and tokens (such as the Axie Infinity SLP) also influenced by this market down trending. Gaming guilds like YGG have a big amount of players inside their guilds, playing games like Axie, League of Kingdoms and many games where we already had presence. Due the recent market down trend, giving a credit line opportunity to big guilds like these with thousands of players all over the world could represent a big chance for help even more their players and get them to know about Dai and DeFi, and how they could empower themselves with games and Dai. But how could be this with everything going down down? Well, the answer is DeFi. Imagine a Maker Vault with the YGG token and a mint of 10M DAI (this is just for example). Those DAI could then be deposited on a DeFi protocol (let\u2019s say Aave), meaning an earning of possibly a 10% (or more) annualy, after this the 10% earning could go on a monthly reward distributed to their players, creating then a new way for incentivize their players for remaining on the guilds, playing games and now being rewarding and using DAI. This will bring lot of new users and gamers to get to know about MakerDAO, DAI and DeFi, mostly from South America and Asia. This could then start to be attractive to other guilds, maybe not with their tokens but at least with their treasury on ETH for example. So gaming guilds will have this new way for incentivizing their players and generating revenue for their own community treasury. As I always try to remember the community, one of the principles of MakerDAO is serving the underserved, most of these players are people looking for ways to bring food to their tables and helping their families, so initiatives like this one could be a way for helping those who need the most.

For the guild treasuries, most of the guild don\u2019t have a token like YGG, but have big treausies on ETH or other tokens, with those they can open Vaults and do the same with the DAI minted as stated above.  Those two should be the main cases for the Gaming Guilds around blockchain games. ",
