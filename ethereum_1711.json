ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 all contain some form of approval in order to allow the transfer of tokens out of an owner\u2019s account. After listening to Evin\u2019s talk, I was wondering if a new \u201cConsent\u201d standard might make sense. Consent would be dual to approval. In a consent model, you would need to give consent before anyone can transfer a token to you. The idea is that a token transfer can, in some circumstances, be a form of harassment. I think this is more of an issue for women and under-represented demographics. I know I had never even thought of this problem that some people face until Evin\u2019s talk. I think a consent standard would make sense and am curious what others might think. I\u2019d be happy to help draft a more formal proposal if there was interest. Take care, Eric ",

Also would like to see that development in multi-signature wallets, so incoming transactions can be collectively approved/rejected before them landing to the account. haven\u2019t yet finished reading them all however, would u consider also elaborate and contemplate further on this aspect on your proposals as well? maybe in terms of account types, along with the various asset type  in case there are works in progress around this, and as well for collaboration, please let me know.
