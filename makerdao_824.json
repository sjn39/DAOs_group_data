Background With the bull market cooling off we are facing the issue of decreased vault demand, and an ever-increasing demand for DAI. To keep the peg balanced we are needing to onboard more and more non-interest-bearing USDC. This has the double negative effect of reducing revenues for the protocol and increasing counter-party risk vs. Circle as a centralized counter-party. Additionally, this increases the regulatory risk for Maker as centralized stablecoins become a key focus for prudential authorities.  There are crypto levers we can lean on such as institutional vaults or borrowing incentives, but inevitably we will need to rely on Real World Assets (RWAs) or other complex and more innovative use cases to scale to the next order of magnitude and beyond.  sc2460\u00d71046 116 KB  We believe the time is right to kick the RWA effort into overdrive. Along with our own efforts to improve and scale the pool of borrowers we already collaborate with, there are a number of off-chain counter-parties and on-chain protocols that have emerged over the last year spearheading the effort to connect RWAs into crypto. This is where we believe we should focus. We are proposing a 2-step plan:  Step 1: Capital Raise Following up from Kris Kaczor\u2019s post we propose this first step to stop the burn and focus on building a massive system surplus. By refocusing all profits into the surplus buffer this will allow us to risk-on for the protocol without causing existential threats like flop auctions. The system surplus is currently at 65M which is peanuts compared to the total DAI supply of 9.7B (0.7%). To protect ourselves from flop auctions we have used this surplus buffer amount to give us padding against tail-risk losses. As a comparison, a traditional regulated financial institution would retain 15-20% of high-quality capital to back unknown risks. Additionally, these institutions have regulatory capital and liquidity requirements which would place Maker below the riskiest institutions at this point. We want to be better than traditional lending institutions, we know, but there is something we can learn from institutions that have been around for tens or sometimes hundreds of years. A larger buffer means we can take on larger debt ceilings for individual loans for which we consider losses more likely, and test other avenues that might be critically risky without such a safety cushion. We propose turning off the burner indefinitely and raising the system surplus by about a half-order of magnitude (~5x) at current DAI supply levels to facilitate new opportunities. We have multiple mechanisms to achieve this, but can focus on two specifically:  Issue Debt Equity is the most expensive source of funding for any project, and also due to the relatively low price of MKR relative to revenues, it makes sense to have debt as the number one source of financing in our pecking order. A module can be built which will act as an insurance fund to protect us from large individual loss events.  debt-fund1709\u00d71400 165 KB  The example above is a module which accepts DAI from anyone, inserts it into the Surplus Buffer and allows them to withdraw at any time with a time-lock of maybe a few months. What users get for inserting their DAI is a preferential payout from revenues. IE we can direct 20m / year into the fund to give 10% APY for a 200m loan. If there is some large loss event it will eat into the insurance buffer and users will no longer be able to withdraw their full amount. They can always wait for the buffer to refill. They get the senior-most position. This revenue sink can be offset by new revenues from the riskier loans. Using a market-driven interest rate curve we can tune this module to provide us with most of the loan we need for the best price. Interestingly enough this can also be used as an indicator for how the market views the protocol risk overall. This could be used to either step on the gas or pull back in the future. The details of this module will need to be worked out, but this is the general idea. In addition, we believe that issuing a fixed-rate financial instrument from the protocol could act, especially during those uncertain times, as a great marketing tool to expand and improve Maker\u2019s perception throughout DeFi.  Sell / Issue Equity We have about 84k MKR sitting in the treasury. We could sell a portion of this under a multi-year vest. @Nadia is confident they will be able to find buyers. Despite uncertainty in the markets there are still VCs interested in making large investments, especially in a protocol as central as Maker to the ecosystem. Terra for example has closed multiple deals in the past few months for 1B USD. Some combination of these two approaches is probably ideal, and if the market changes from here we will probably want to adjust between the two. Instead of committing up-front to a particular plan we can form a working group amongst relevant DAO members to negotiate the best deals possible.  Step 2: Risk-On (Although Conservatively) Maker so far has been fairly risk averse - perhaps scarred by the events of Black Thursday. Almost all of our exposure has effectively no risk of losses, but this is not how lending normally works. We should instead expect losses on individual loans and offset that with overall interest rates. We believe this conservative attitude needs to improve for us to thrive. As stated above there are a number of protocols which are focused entirely on bridging RWAs, and they need cheap credit. Something which we have in spades. One of the main issues we\u2019ve run into is legal blockers and structuring frameworks that work cross jurisdictions. That is MKR holders are concerned about being \u201crugged\u201d without a legal agreement in place. While we should strive for legal guarantees in the long-term, it should not be a blocker in the short term if we ensure the presence of the right on-chain guarantees and a conservative debt ceiling. Many protocols operate entirely by not wanting to damage their reputation in such a new market. It\u2019s clear that the tail-risk of a rugging for many projects can be over-exaggerated. In any case this should not be something that blocks us entirely, but instead is just factored into the cost of doing business. This is not to say that we should just start extending credit lines to everyone. There are scams out there, as well as sub-par counter-parties we don\u2019t want to engage with, but there are also a lot of projects wanting to push the boundaries. With a much larger system surplus we are free to experiment and assist these teams that are dedicated to solving the problem of on-chain sophisticated credit. The idea is that when one or two projects achieve scale, it will allow us to more than compensate those that lose money and break free of this crypto-only impasse. Beyond RWAs, having a larger system surplus will allow us to do other activities which were previously deemed too risky. These are things such as deploying MCD to Polygon PoS, loaning DAI to a centralized market maker or even just simply lowering the collateralization ratio requirements. The risk of losses in all these scenarios is definitely higher than our current state, but they are individually still relatively small. We just need to be okay with a few of these loss events occurring on occasion. To protect ourselves from draining the surplus buffer we need to expect one or two of these events to occur, possibly in rapid succession. With the current system surplus size we cannot exceed around ~30M per independent loss event (~half of system surplus). This is nowhere near enough to clear the 6B+ in stablecoin backing we have. By increasing the system surplus to the 250m range we can 5x this amount to something more like ~150M per independent loss event. If we can onboard 10+ of these then we are starting to see numbers approaching the 6B. This gives us protection in a worst-case scenario where all the DAI is stolen, but in reality this sort of complete loss event is unlikely to happen. We\u2019ve even seen hacks in the past rescued by off-chain efforts in order to preserve the company\u2019s reputation. Protocols that prove themselves reliable and build a reasonable track record can receive larger debt ceilings.  The General Direction of Maker As I outlined in a personal post, I believe to scale to the numbers we need we have to be more reliant on delegating to protocols that are focused on specific efforts. We should be going wider and giving the opportunity for success to a large number of protocols. In addition to individual deals we should be connecting to lenders that have existed in TradFi for hundreds of years. These people are experts in assessing risk and who to extend credit to. There is no need to reinvent the wheel here. They need cheap credit and we need expertise. Maker needs to focus on being a competitive and innovative credit wholesaler rather than assessing individual loans. We need to onboard protocols like Maple, TrueFi and others which are solely focused on connecting RWA borrowers to on-chain lenders. This is their whole business and by delegating minting rights (within reason) we can grow the workforce indirectly. Let\u2019s use the DeFi legos to grow exponentially.  risk-on2113\u00d72009 417 KB  As you can see in the image above, a larger system surplus is a multiplier on all the high risk pools. Individually they can all be pretty small compared to the total DAI supply, but if we go wide we can meet the 6B number we need. It is important to note that these risks need to be independent from each other in order to diversify enough to survive individual loss events. Due to the under-collateralized nature of these loans they are inherently riskier than what we\u2019ve dealt with before, but that also means they sometimes carry higher interest rates, and that they expand the accessible use cases for the protocol. If we can go wide with these loans, and the average return is higher than the average losses, we can scale. We start small, build confidence, approach the system surplus size and eventually exceed it. Some of these pools are yielding around 10-20%. That\u2019s 20-40m / year in additional revenue at 200m in loans. Granted we need to expect losses, but over time we can create a forward-looking model of how big we expect these losses to be. This will allow us to smooth over individual losses. Again, we want to stress the importance of maintaining a rigorous understanding of the losses potentially involved, and we are not advocating to become the last option for low quality borrowers. We need to balance both sides of the equation. We make it clear to any protocol that can execute this strategy at scale in a safe way will be getting several billion in DAI loans at a reasonable rate.  Beyond the Immediate Problem Once we have overcome the DAI supply problem we do not have to stop there. Currently the value proposition for DAI over USDC is not terribly strong. If we re-enter the excess DAI supply territory we will be able to drive DAI demand by doing things such as re-activating the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) or coming out with cashback programs. This will create a positive feedback cycle which will allow us to scale to the next order of magnitude and out-compete USDC as the DeFi currency of choice. Another opportunity on the horizon is rising interest rates. Central banks in most countries have indicated that they will be raising interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation. This will allow us to undercut the traditional banks and provide cheaper credit to those that need it. In summary, we have reached a critical point where we need to grow into new markets or risk losing out to a competitor. Crypto-native lending has more or less worked so far due to the bull market, but we need uncorrelated assets at scale and we need them now. We already have a massive advantage with DAI being one of the most trusted stablecoins available. Let\u2019s not squander this first-mover advantage with decision paralysis. Instead let\u2019s lean into the future and embrace crypto\u2019s merge with the real world. We are sure to find partners in this journey, both as investors and as potential counter-parties.  Next Steps The aim of this post was to start the high level discussion on this pivot. @Growth-Core-Unit will be releasing a more detailed post soon with a concrete plan of action. Let\u2019s make 2022 the year of Maker. ",

There are several pros and cons of debt vs equity vs other forms of stakeholder financing we could consider at a later stage. Happy to have your and the community\u2019s views on this. Based on my years in investment banking for financial institutions, I like the debt idea because:  Debt is obviously cheaper and less dilutive than equity/ token financing Debt in fixed rates is something that the DeFi (institutional) market is truly interested in and peer-to-peer or peer-to-protocol money markets haven\u2019t yet been able to meet - due to their competitive disadvantage vs a protocol that is sovereign with its own stable Debt can be tweaked up / down based on needs and market - to do this with token/ equity is much more difficult  Having said that, probably the sweet spot is a combination of various financing sources, also considering the amounts we are talking about. I also agree with you that we should try to \u201cuse\u201d capital raising as a tool to increase engagement and create a virtuous effect that benefits the ecosystem as a whole. But this can be done through several levers. The divide and conquer approach could be the right one. ",

In the same way, we could optimise our cost of capital by trying to maximise debt issuance but also issue tokens that are not as easily redeemable but more dilutive. Again, in trad banking, this would be similar to issuing Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Alternative Tier 1 capital (like convertible hybrids), Tier 2 capital (some form of redeemable senior debt). And we are DeFi, so we can learn from the mistakes, do things better, and leverage permissionless technology. Many details to iron out, but the future is bright  ",

Some observations from a beginner in this DeFi world:  As you have rightly pointed out in your articles before, which this capital raising initiative is aiming to solve for, the current loss absorbing capital base of MKR is thin However, if the collateralisation level and the quality (mainly liquidity and volatility) of the collateral are calibrated appropriately, the capital base should not cause a concern Seems to me that even with the current collateral definitions there is a need to re-inforce the loss absorbing capacity of MKR In my humble view, you might want to ensure that the aim of this capital raise is clearer? Is it to increase leverage (thereby increasing the risk profile of the equity base) or for the new capital to provide (in addition to leverage) additional loss absorbing capacity? I do not see why someone would be willing to provide pure leverage (senior) with a wafer thin loss absorbing buffer at the equity level. Upside is capped but downside could be large. Providing some warrants type features (MKR linked) would be required in my view (to also align incentives) Furthermore, rapid expansion into illiquid / higher volatility collaterals and RWAs (reg risk) could potentially increase the risk profile multi-fold all at once. Sometimes, one or two steps better than leaping too far\u2026  All the best, ",

                    "content": "Thanks for this @Naren_Ramachandran, great to see you here. As you mentioned, nothing truly new under the sun: the protocol aims at strengthening its capital position in the most efficient way in order to do more business. Looking at a lending institution\u2019s balance sheet through the lens of a lender is useful up to a certain point. I guess the key point here, is the intention to improve Maker\u2019s solvency position. I think \u2018first loss\u2019 definition isn\u2019t truly applicable in a financial balance sheet, and it would be more useful to talk about \u201cpermanence\u201d and \u201cremuneration discretion\u201d of loss absorbing capital. Obviously, as an institution we would like to have the most permanent / discretionary type of capital possible. That type of capital, typically, is expensive - or dilutive. I believe that @hexonaut\u2019s point over a debt issuance shouldn\u2019t be seen as prescriptive. The main point is that we believe there is a market for a cheaper/ less dilutive type of capital that is not a straight token. But that retains the same type of permanence and remuneration discretion. Most probably we will reach a mix of capital sources, at a mix of costs for the protocol. I find fascinating that we are having those conversations in the first place. To @Naren_Ramachandran\u2019s points.     Naren_Ramachandran:  Seems to me that even with the current collateral definitions there is a need to re-inforce the loss absorbing capacity of MKR   I fully agree. The stop to MKR burning has gone in this direction, but we will always be behind if we wait for endogenous profit generation. Also, and I know this is difficult to master for old FIG warriors like us, there are a bunch of operational risks in a protocol such as Maker, mainly related to collateral liquidation mechanisms, that need to be protected by the buffer. In addition, Maker is still a very young venture, and although we should aim at consistent profitability we cannot rely on profit reserves to finance operations if, like it happens today, our revenues are still extremely volatile.     Naren_Ramachandran:  In my humble view, you might want to ensure that the aim of this capital raise is clearer? Is it to increase leverage (thereby increasing the risk profile of the equity base) or for the new capital to provide (in addition to leverage) additional loss absorbing capacity?   I think on this @hexonaut and @Nadia have shown the path. As of today, we have no loss reserves to absorb any loss even in the most conservative off-chain / illiquid collateral exposure. Aim of a healthier surplus buffer would be to offer more confidence in doing business. Even if an off-chain exposure is activated with an effective 1% expected loss (investment grade level), at 1b of this exposures (which is a conservative ambition) we could see fluctuations of 10s of MM (pre recovery) and probably more with portfolios ramping up to maturity. And this is only for the known unknowns, that we should aim at protecting through over-collateralisation and excess spreads in the structures. Still, I have been advocating with Growth and others that we shouldn\u2019t forget the need to remain conservative and loyal to Maker\u2019s mantra of prudent innovation.     Naren_Ramachandran:  I do not see why someone would be willing to provide pure leverage (senior) with a wafer thin loss absorbing buffer at the equity level. Upside is capped but downside could be large. Providing some warrants type features (MKR linked) would be required in my view (to also align incentives)   As I was mentioning before, I believe this will be a negotiation with investors. Ultimately we aim at minimising cost of capital of a surplus buffer while also innovating beyond a straight token issuance. We will learn about appetite while exploring. You are suggesting warrants, I think a hybrid / contigent convertible structure is plausible. It would be great to have senior financial professionals chip in the conversations here on the post or through other channels to structure this in the best possible way.     Naren_Ramachandran:  Furthermore, rapid expansion into illiquid / higher volatility collaterals and RWAs (reg risk) could potentially increase the risk profile multi-fold all at once. Sometimes, one or two steps better than leaping too far\u2026   You are preaching to the preachers. As @Eumenes and the rest of the RWF CU knowns, we have done enormous work in trying to share our views with the community that we should increase the quality of the collateral, the quality of the structures, the solidity of the legal contracts, while we prudently ramp up our exposure. We know that Maker is hungry for growth, but we are ultimately running a currency and we shouldn\u2019t forget that currency holders\u2019 trust is our most precious asset. ",

In that timeframe DAI only ever deviated upwards. I am glad to see additional layers of protection, but even without loss absorption mechanism beyond  dilution, history so far shows that trust in DAI is extremely strong. ",

The Protocol Engineering team is working on standardizing the D3M design such that adding new protocol to protocol connections takes way less time. Depending on the protocol (and if they use standards such as ERC-4626) the turn-around time for new protocols can be quite low. Intermediary costs totally depend on the protocol.     Traster_Tray:  How do we go about determining the worthiness of the protocols themselves?   Relevant Core Units will still be doing due diligence on everything being onboarded. This will include technical analysis, liquidity constraints, legal risk, counter-party risk, etc. Seeing protocols working properly for some period of time is very helpful as well.     Traster_Tray:  What\u2019s the timeline for all this to happen?   All of this is being worked on that has already been signalled from the technical side (Maple D3M, Compound D3M, Rari D3M, multi-chain). It\u2019s just until we grow the surplus buffer we cannot issue large loans to some of these protocols. Growth will be publishing a concrete plan to do the capital raise in parallel.     Traster_Tray:  Do we have to wait for the surplus buffer to contain 250m to start looking into any of these ventures?   No, we should be onboarding this stuff at small debt ceilings to get the ball rolling imo. As the money comes in for the Surplus Buffer we grow the ceilings to match. For example, we\u2019ve already received a signal request to prioritize onboarding Maple. We can proceed to do that, but we can\u2019t give them large loans until we have the other piece     Traster_Tray:  Will you want to continue building the SB even after you have 250m in there?   Yes, although we will need to re-assess whether further capital raises are warranted or if we have reached escape velocity with recurring revenues. ",

Anyone could then purchase this bond at at price of 1 Dai per 1 \u201cdai bond\u201d, that at maturity (1 year) can be redeemed for 1.01 Dai. This would increase the surplus buffer upfront by 100 M. The module would then over 1 year suck 101 M dai from the surplus buffer to the bond module similarly to the budget streams. Maker would then need to make a 1 % yield on the raised capital to be net neutral. Furthermore, we could allow dai-bond holders to borrow Dai against the bond as collateral.

I think what Super-T is asking here, what are some of the crypto-related strategies and innovative solutions that this proposal is advocating for? And I can answer him by specifying some of the ideas in the works. Such as the development of Maker Wormhole to feed CanonicalDAI into other realms, deployment of StarkNet, the possibilities of launching MCD Vaults on a Layer 2, D3M deployments, etc., etc. But what Super-T wants to hear is what will MakerDAO do today? Specially when you hear that AAVE is launching v3 on EVMOS, and they will receive 50% of every smart contract transaction that gets executed on AAVE v3. That\u2019s extra free revenue that usually goes to Validators on PoS Chains. So, I get it that the stars are not currently aligned, the market is off a step, or two. But things are happening. And they will continue to happen, as this community continues to debate in what direction this DAO should go. Folks, it\u2019s time to start making things happen.  ",

However I think what @flipflopflapdelegate is trying to say (@flipflopflapdelegate please correct me if I am wrong) is that, beside this well organised (CUs) work,  there is seemingly also the need of also having more organic growth in terms of spontaneous contributions (as in FOSS projects), which should naturally lead with connections with other crypto projects, etc. In my opinion you (@hexonaut) are the greatest example of this so far. You independently came out with the Smart-contract code for swapping DAI with USDC at the time. This was a relatively small piece of code, but a huge contribution to Maker. For this I have advocated a few times that we should promote Hackatons, \u2018courses\u2019 and whatever kind of activities that are required to boost this movement. In short: beside a well-organised and well-executed plan (by CUs) we perhaps also need some more agile development and experimentation. ",

Crypto-native lending has more or less worked so far due to the bull market, but we need uncorrelated assets at scale and we need them now. We already have a massive advantage with DAI being one of the most trusted stablecoins available. Let\u2019s not squander this first-mover advantage with decision paralysis. Instead let\u2019s lean into the future and embrace crypto\u2019s merge with the real world. We are sure to find partners in this journey, both as investors and as potential counter-parties.   I really like this paragraph.  Given that there are significant networks effects for stable coins, a stable coin needs to scale rapidly\u2026  or die on the vine. As long as Maker doesnt blow up due to DAI instability, I think rapid growth is the smartest (and lowest risk) path forward. As such I fully support taking smart risks in learning & building organic DAI demand! ",

IMO we need a stronger dose of \u201cFi\u201d to power the \u201cRe\u201d (need more de-finance expertise to add to the regenerative economy disciplines leading in that space).
