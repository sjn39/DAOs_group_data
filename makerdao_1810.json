Facilitating the \u201cStrategic Finance Core Unit, CES Core Unit, or Growth Core Unit\u201d in creating a proper entity-onboarding Signal Request. Coordinating with technical teams on producing an expected Executive date once a legal entity has been onboarded(and cleared with Coinbase) Facilitating(drafting copy, getting confirmations from stakeholders, merging PRs to list) an executive bundle with a transfer. Putting people in touch for questions and comments.   Strategic Finance (SF-001)  Seek approval for a specific legal entity, i.e., an arranger. Maker Governance will have control over the funds and access the funds.   Collateral Engineering Service (CES-001)  We want to look at the trustless way of considering and base primarily on the feedback we see in the community and some of the concerns raised. That would be my signal if this MIP were passed I would highly encourage any of these MIPs to look at our past work, how we have answered the questions, the details around the deal, the legal and regulatory structure, and the technical implementation. Before you put up a MIP, talk and gain consensus and agreement of the individual CUs you are requesting work from, and then place the MIP out there. Please reach out. We are here to help.   Growth (GRO-001)  Our main focus is to find the opportunity, the partner. Once approved, it is more in the hands of CES, PE, SF, and other CUs. As we do with everything inside Maker, we will prepare an announcement, talk with a partner and the people at Maker who helped to onboard or make it happen to work on a PR, and have the announcement everywhere. It is important to remind delegates and the Maker community to look at these deals not as unique but as part of a solution. We have all of this idle capital. What can we do with it? Strategic Finance has presented a framework for taking advantage of that idle capital and increasing revenue for Maker.   The Exercise 33:13  The &quot;Yes and...&quot;1417\u00d7802 119 KB   Discussion Segment 37:03    Payton Rose: Who would like to start and say something about MIP81?  39:47   PaperImperium: Is there any dark magic we can use to get around the custody downside? Can we get around the risk of giving full custody to Coinbase?   Robert: We can explore the trustless option, which allows Coinbase to have custody of a smart contract. This special function will enable us to claw back if we need to. Before recommending it, we are working with Coinbase to see if this is a real solution. Miguel also made a good point: a trustless solution requires some development, audit, and verification work. A manual solution may be quicker, but we have identified its downsides.  Raphael: The smart contract is amazing. However, considering Coinbase\u2019s perspective, they will have input on the contract\u2019s nature. While a smart contract is ideal, it is for the longer term. They have no reason to rush it and will likely stall it, at least for a couple of months.  Mark: I spoke with Coinbase, and from the beginning, they were interested in an automated and permissionless solution. They want to help us make it a reality. However, the challenges are more on the non-technical side. The DAO needs to decide the liquidity level on-chain. That will determine how much funds are moved back and forth. From this, it makes the most sense to start manually to get cash in the door. Then, we can transition to a new solution.    46:05   Raphael: Have your concerns been addressed from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective?   Patrick: Yes and no. GovAlpha initially had concerns about the incompleteness of the MIP. It did not fit the template. This concern has been addressed. We still do have concerns from the governance perspective. Specifically, we have concerns about the withdrawal of the funds, their time frame, and the governance process around that. However, this is a legitimate MIP and will go on-chain next week.    48:23   Frank: The 3F Delegate Platform supports MIP81 and what Gemini has proposed. We want to greenlight this but are also in favor of automation. We would love a trustless environment because custodial services and risk management is missing. This includes transaction, compliance, and credit risks. What are the parameters Risk CU provides to the community?  51:07   Tim Black: If the MIP fails, will they submit again?   Payton Rose: I do not have a direct answer, but I believe so.    52:19    Justin: I see a situation where the DAO ends the agreement in the future. This MIP asks for a huge portion of the PSM, and the payoff percentage is insignificant. We have several things that could utilize the USDC in the PSM. In the future, we might not have that much USDC in the PSM or even a PSM. It is prudent for us to end this agreement if that comes to fruition. It could be a nice baseline if we can manage that risk\u2014however, there are other opportunities to earn more money on our balance sheet than the one percent.   David Utrobin: Automating the MIP is not all or nothing. Automation could potentially be done in phases. Before we determine that, we need to confirm with Coinbase their criteria for custody of a smart contract. One of our team members, Nikolai, suggested that if Coinbase can custody a smart contract, it could be as much as taking our MIP21 output conduit. The only way the USDC can be taken out of that smart contract is via return to the PSM. Then, further automation could be done later on.    55:58   PaperImperium: Does voting on this lock us into a schedule or implementation? Or is it just conceptual?   Payton Rose: I would say a level above conceptual. The MIP outlines what happens after it passes. It asks a CU to pass a signal to push this forward. Of course, that gives the option for the entity to get rejected.    56:59   Raphael: I want to further Patrick\u2019s point of auto-signaling when the PSM reaches a certain level. We can say in their arranger agreement that one signal will withdraw funds immediately at a certain level with no executive requirement.  58:23   Payton Rose: David said in the chat that the implementation requires sign-up from CUs. That is a potential blocking point. Paper has pointed out some questions about implementation that lie in Robert\u2019s earlier points. It falls on your shoulders if you do not talk to a CU and expect it to happen.  59:09   Frank: I would like to address the community question. I see from the telegram chats that people do not think MakerDAO and Dai are cool anymore. If Aave were doing this, you would not hear this chatter. Regardless, this is a huge opportunity for MakerDAO.  1:01:45   Payton Rose: Considering the Gemini proposal, what other opportunities exist for Maker? Does this open the door to pursuing other partnerships?  Chat: The Coinbase MIP is a big deal. Everyone is starting to realize the opportunities of working with Maker. The positive attention given to Maker through this MIP proposal is huge.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:08:05  Big thanks for everyone coming out. Check out forum.makerdao.com, and see you soon.

Monetalis is trying to set up the metaDAO situation with MIP 65 as the pyramid foundation. MIP 65, 88, 89, and 82 are trying to get us to a place with a sufficient amount of approved counterparties for the metaDAO to develop an appropriate asset allocation strategy that would work for a stablecoin\u2026  38:46   Jeremy: Redwood Trust is a publically traded company; our ticket is RWT. Our business involves residential housing. We aggregate loans to create assets for our investor base. Redwood has been doing this since 1996.   Alan: That was a wonderful introduction.     Discussion  Discussion: MIP89: Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian 47:57   John: I am the head of group I.T. with a second function as the principal of distribution and securitization for blockchain tokenization. Arrow is a vertically integrated asset manager and servicer in Europe. We service loans and assets on behalf of 200 banks across five countries. We own 17 servicing platforms and have 70 billion Euros under management. We own about two billion.  56:48   Jeremy: Paper asked about the discount for Maker. Any costs associated with that are on the Redwood side.  1:00:26   Jeremy: There is another question about commercial-backed securities and the inclusion of this collateral. We would not cross-collateralize residential and commercial levels.  1:03:33   Allan Pederson: Someone asked why there are so many MIPs when MIP 65 is just starting. This is because I need to ensure that the metaDAO has a sufficient range of options to invest from.  1:04:43   Allan Pederson: Someone asked why I think cash from the issuances should be reinvested. In both cases, there is monthly interest coming in from the principal. The cash flow will go back to Maker for its operating costs. This maintains the exposure.  1:06:04   Allan Pederson: Now that signal requests are no longer valid, how do you engage the community\u2019s appetite to keep investing versus taking back the proceeds to SB?  I need to work on solving that.    1:08:09   Allan Pederson: Will the Sequoia Platform also incur allocations to the CMBS market?  No, not in this particular case.    1:08:53   Allan Pederson: Who bares the Balloon Risks in the RMBS?   Jeremy: The investor.  Person 3: Is there an RMBS tranche in the portfolio?  Jeremy: Not in the current structure, but we could.    1:13:27   ElPro: How will MIP 89 structure itself to the appetite of the Maker community?   Alan: Arrow will define a credit box that specifics the portfolios going into this MIP.    1:16:13   ElPro: Can you walk us through non-performance loans (NPLs)?  We will not be doing NPLs. The future relates more to ESG and green lending.    1:19:33   Alan: How much should we allow a single actor to control? Is it better to split existential risk levels between several actors?   David: Where does the risk lie?  Alan: We are not at the point of failure because we are not making the investments.    1:23:19   Alan: Who is monitoring the total rehypothecated USDC number?  Strategic Finance is doing work on this.    1:28:00   Alan: How do these two MIPs relate to MIP 65?  They both work to present the metaDAO with a range of asset options to build a portfolio with the stablecoin. They also share similarities in legal setups.    1:28:56   Alan: Can you explain the MIP titles? Why the houses?  A project always needs a memorable title. I ride horses, and each initiative is named after another horse breed.    1:29:37   Alan: How is this related to the Clean Money Initiative?  Redwood and Arrow are very receptive to using greenhouse gas accounting.    1:31:06   Alan: Are there any management fees? How does Monetalis make money? Are there any kickbacks?  There are no kickbacks. We are trying to figure out reasonable fees. There aren\u2019t many comparable models for arrangers.    Suggestion Box  Credits  Larry Wu produced this summary.

If there is still a need for such a person, it is because someone must make final payments and oversee the overall shutdown of the operation.   Juan: The Auditor\u2019s role will not be to set up agreements and continue working with other CUs but to do what Governance asks them to do.   Payton Rose: Such as GovAlpha\u2019s role is to ensure that, for example, any given MIP proposed and passed by MKR Holders is accordingly put up as an Executive and executed promptly.      36:36   Frank Cruz: Regarding the need to address the possibility of grifting, it is 3F\u2019s Platform point of view that it is fundamental to start onboarding individuals with the best intentions at heart when it comes to making sure that this DAO prospers from their work. It is a new paradigm. It is about building an ecosystem with contributors that will produce good results with honesty and are willing to do the right thing, no matter what their future might be within the DAO.  40:06   Robert: Moving forward with the End Game plan, we should take advantage\u2013if the End Game MIPs pass\u2013of the change of times and start looking into our vetting process and how to apply it when onboarding new Meta DAOs and individuals. It should always be all about MakerDAO. We must always look out for Maker\u2019s best interest. A vetting process could be a fine addition to the culture of MakerDAO.  42:27   MakerMan: Once the offboarding process ends for RWF, what is the wind-down time/close date to submit invoices?

How will that be drafted and ratified?   Payton Rose: Within the Pre MIP Set, it is not specified. It would have to be a Standalone or separate governance motion that would draft a Constitution. The general idea is to gather more aspects from the overall plan and try to put that into a less mutable form.    52:07   ACREinvest: Regarding the Constitution, is it a gating item for any other mandates?   Payton Rose: This PreLaunch MIP Set is putting us in the direction of tackling an EndGame. If passed, we can work on those items, one of them being the Constitution, which will be more solidified in terms of what can be changed and how easily.  Derek: The idea of gating is a good one to add because there is a lot implied in the EndGame plan, but it is not explicitly written out or documented. So, on the technical side, we will have to figure out what elements need to be tackled first, even if they are long out in the overall scheme of EndGame.    54:55   Jacob: Could MIP 4 still be used to repel the EndGame MIP Set?   Payton Rose: Unless there is a rule that passes saying that no more amendments would stand and could still be used,  our MIPs are the closest that we have to the Constitution.    56:39   David Utrobin: What is the possibility of breaking this into bite-sized technical, social, and governance chunks? Can we do one MetaDAO, for example, to start?   Payton Rose: A lot of us are waiting to see how that will be done.  Frank Cruz: To build a new organizing principle, you need more than just one MetaDAO because you have to use this circle of different clusters where each cluster can work together and somehow cluster together to become a MetaDAO. If you get one MetaDAO, you will not be able to grow that ecosystem.    1:04:08   Nadia Alvarez: What will happen with CUs if the focus is on clusters and MetaDAOs?   David Utrobin: CUs should see what is happening with clusters and MetaDAOs and see where they may fit.  Payton Rose: It is a year minimum from when the pre-launch stuff passes from when we might see MetaDAOs. There is a lot of work and things to be figured out during that time, and many of the mandates are about keeping the DAO running.  Frank Cruz: It is a difficult question. Some CUs are essential to keeping the protocol working. In my opinion, if you are a CU that provides a service that can equate to an ecosystem actor, you should start thinking about how you can provide that service either as an ecosystem actor or a member of a cluster.
