In the coming months we will start the migration to launch Multi-collateral DAI\u2026 and thereafter to launch the DSR. The objective: Arrive at the end with MCD and DSR with DAI not changing the price off the peg more than it would have if we stayed on SCD. The challenge: introducing new market forces & changing fundamentally from a monetary policy to a risk & monetary policy Suggestions: Forum rough consensus as to the big picture steps to arrive\u2026 Recommended Step #1: Launch MCD and use ether as the sole collateral with the identical risk parameters as in SCD including a materially similar debt ceiling\u2026 further use the same stability fee. {Logic says that if there are no market force changes, the price, nor the supply nor the motivations of the participants should change} Recommended Step #2: Add an additional collateral package of ETH but with a stability fee that is approved by the interim-risk team. {note this is purely a risk question\u2026 nothing to do with monetary policy}\u2026 with one material change of a debt ceiling that is extremely low. Around $100 {by setting the amount very low, we will not cause the minting of any material amount of DAI thus not disrupting the price equilibrium} Recommended Step #3: Launch the DSR with an interest rate that is extremely low {by setting the amount very low we will not cause the usage to be high thus not disrupting the price equilibrium} Recommended Step #4: Increase the debt ceiling on the new collateral package by $10,000 {something but enough to cause the price of DAI to be impacted Recommended Step #5: Increase the DSR by 10bps {something but not enough to move the price of DAI} Recommended Step #6: Iterate of steps 4 and 5 over and over until we get the debt ceiling to not be the limiting factor on the amount of DAI issued. {the core objective here is to control the increase of issuance of DAI withOUT moving the DAI price} Recommended Step #7: Start to reduce the debt ceiling on the original collateral package until down to zero. the above are purely recommendations. as a community we need to discuss / debate the merits of the above or come up with something different all together. most importantly, we need to form rough consensus on the concept of bifurcating the existing monetary policy only via SF to one where there is distinct and segregated risk policy (via the SF(MCDx)\u2026 and monetary policy\u2026 one where the monetary policy is controlled via the DSR\u2026 ",

As a SCD CDP owner you can move your CDP to the MCD CDP through the redeemer portal that you\u2019ll find at makerdao.com at launch. Or close your CDP by paying back your debt and redeeming your ether back.   If you hold your Dai in a wallet where you control your private keys, then head to a page on makerdao.com which will be announced at launch. Follow the instructions to upgrade to MCD and optionally activate Savings Dai, which allows you to earn savings.  Both taken from https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/mcd/upgrading-to-multi-collateral-dai/upgrading-to-multi-collateral-dai.md, last updated June 8th. Some thoughts:  There will be the ability to like for like migrate CDPs from one system to another. This means that there will need to be \u2018room\u2019 for migration within the new debt ceiling for Eth, we would want to ensure this because we want migration to be as easy as possible, forcing CDP holders to wait, or to migrate a bit by bit is a really crap user experience. How can this even work regarding migrating old Dai to new Dai? Dai has to be backed by a CDP. The only migration possible can be by selling old and buying new, in which case holding the peg for both systems will be both essential and nightmarishly difficult.  Would be good to know how this is going to work behind the scenes. ",
