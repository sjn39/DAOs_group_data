                    "content": "The intended audience for this post is users of the makerdao github. (cc @Core-Facilitators ) Currently Dai Foundation is the caretaker of the makerdao github. This post outlines the plans for a cleanup and categorization of repositories in the makerdao github such that we can try to minimize bureaucracy around managing github repositories. When a repository in the makerdao github is used for publishing information this is considered communicating on behalf of MakerDAO. This means such a repository is an intangible MakerDAO asset, and the right to manage content in it has to go through the same process as for getting allowed to use a makerdao.com subdomain, manage the MakerDAO twitter account and so on. Meanwhile, most repositories in the makerdao github are used to support software development and store the resulting software. This software is also an intangible asset. However, here the challenge is not to make it hard for people to work with the repository, but to ensure that the software is open source and that the copyright is assigned to Dai Foundation such that the software remains a public good. Finally, there are a lot of repositories in the makerdao github that aren\u2019t used anymore, and the plan is to archive all such repositories. To distinguish between different types of repositories we plan on using the classification that is described in the following section.  Classification of repositories To know which repositories falls under the Maker Intangible Asset Assignment process and facilitate the archiving process, all repositories will be categorized in one of the following classes:   Repositories used to support software and/or content development benefitting the Maker Protocol.  The output from this class of repo is SOFTWARE or content that is deployed to some platform (decentralized or centralized) OUTSIDE Github.  These repositories will have publishing of github pages turned off. Managing these repositories does not need to involve the MakerDAO Intangible Asset Assignment process, but it should be ensured that the output remains MakerDAO public goods (by assigning Copyright to Dai Foundation)   Repositories used to manage content that is PUBLISHED using GITHUB AS PLATFORM. This can be using github pages, but it can for example also be by storing markdown documents in the repository (for example, as was the case with the awesome.makerdao repository). To get Content Manager ownership of a Class 2 repository one must follow the MIP60 process.   Repositories that hold software which no MakerDAO Core Unit is ready to maintain and isn\u2019t considered actively developed currently/anymore, but it still IS PART OF THE MAKER PROTOCOL (Example: This could be an early auction keeper)   Repositories that hold software NOT USED IN THE MAKER PROTOCOL. This will be from the time when Maker Foundation managed the github project or even before that.    How to specify which class a repository belongs to In the non-archived repositories the first line in the About section must contain the following  For Class 1: SW Repo; Content Manager: <Core Unit Name or Individual>  For Class 2: Content Repo; Content Manager: <Core Unit Name or Individual>    Cleanup steps As part of the above classification listed above, the following steps will be taken  Class 1 - SOFTWARE - repositories will be assigned to a Core Unit willing to take responsibility for the software in that repository. These repositories will also have a Contributor License Agreement assistant integrated to ensure that contributors share their copyright with Dai Foundation. No formal process is needed for changes to these repositories outside what the responsible CU agrees with TechOps.  Repositories that nobody are ready to take responsibility for, but where there clearly need for maintenance/further development (like for example the Maker Website software) will remain in a PENDING state Class 2 - CONTENT - repositories will be assigned to a Core Unit willing to take content ownership assigned as content managers - either via grandfathered access (meaning they already have access) or via the Asset Allocation MIP60.   Dai Foundation will maintain ultimate access control ownership of these repositories -  as any other MakerDAO intangible asset - ensuring they are used according to the MakerDAO principles.  Repositories that nobody is ready to take Content Manager responsibility for will be archived with a message that states the content is OUT OF DATE. Class 3 repositories will be archived, staying public thus become read-only Class 4 repositories will be archived and made private   What is next While soliciting comments on the cleanup plan for the makerdao github described in this post, Dai Foundation will begin the work to classify repositories and assign responsible parties in collaboration with relevant Core Units. If you have any comments please add them over the next couple of weeks. ",

One question regarding class 4 assets; could it be that this includes components & applications that are no longer actively maintained by a Core Unit? If so I\u2019d recommend to exercise caution in deprecating these repos/making them unavailable since they might still cover critical user paths, although rarely used. Examples would be the Migration Dashboard (for post-ESM redemption of collateral and SAI>DAI migration) and the Auctions Dashboard (for flap/flop auctions). ",
