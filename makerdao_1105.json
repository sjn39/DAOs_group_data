So there is hope for you @wingstick_99942 . But this compensation mechanism, if voted and if implemented (two non-trivial if\u2019s) will take quite a while. The best you can do is to start participating in MakerDAO\u2019s governance (as you started doing by writing on this forum) and ask the DAO to vote/implement on the above compensation scheme.
