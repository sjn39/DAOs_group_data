I think it would be really helpful and also more efficient to have a weekly All Hands type call for all of the Core Units. There could be a weekly stand up where all of the Core Units attend and give an update on what they are working on, answer questions, etc.  This meeting could include everyone and replace the other office hour meetings, update meetings, etc, and streamline the Community meetings. I would personally find it beneficial to have a weekly update call on what\u2019s happening in the CUs and what everyone is working on.  Curious to hear others thoughts as well! ",

The point of them is that anyone can show up and speak to the relevant core unit about stuff, this isn\u2019t possible if there is one meeting where everyone is giving updates. Imo this is important for transparency and accessibility, and it also provides a way for CU people to drop-in with other CU\u2019s to ask questions, clarify joint work, etc, which I feel can help with efficiency - no need to book in a meeting when you can just show up.

As the numbers of meetings grow, they begin to consume a lot of valuable time for both speakers, listeners, and even the contributors who help transcribe. Written updates provide each team the ability to comprehensively detail their weekly updates at their leisure, potentially resulting in higher-quality updates. Also, David provided a great illustration and breakdown supporting the decision towards written updates. ",
