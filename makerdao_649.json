                    "content": " General Updates  L2 DAI liquidity We\u2019ve been following DAI liquidity on L1s and L2s, focusing on L2s (as it\u2019s part of our multichain strategy) and we have concluded what\u2019s obvious for everyone: we need more DAI liquidity out there.  image2630\u00d7544 194 KB  Thanks @Facundo for the research By observing what has happened, initially, there\u2019s a preference towards USDC, which is why all new projects launching try to get liquidity in USDC in the first place, pushing the ETH/USDC and wBTC/USDC pairs and USDC liquidity in general. In previous updates, I\u2019ve discussed the possibility of working with an MM, but these L2s are pretty new and usually don\u2019t have a developed strategy for them. Other options we have are giving rewards and incentivizing Dai liquidity or partnering with a DEX, by providing liquidity (ETH/DAI and wBTC/DAI at least). Recently ZigZag presented a proposal to the terra community to bootstrap UST liquidity on zkSync and StarkNet with 15M UST, helping them increase UST adoption on those L2s. This is an open call for the community to support us by developing an L2 Dai liquidity strategy. With @pyramidmaker we will start working on this, but we would like to count on more people thinking about solving this challenge. @MakerMan  Growth Offsite Next week all the growth team will be almost offline in our offsite, with limited access to emails/discord.
