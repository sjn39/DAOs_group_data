                    "content": "This is primarily an input to Delegates. I know delegates have been looking at various governance structures as input for thinking about their role. Here is one such input. It is just purely food for thought. I have spent a good number of years on IC and been part of deal-teams feeding an IC and I will here try to sum up some observations on how this governance structure operates - but please remember this is n=1 and focus entirely on private equity/large private credit where you live \u201cdeal-by-deal\u201d. Pension funds,  Investment Trusts, Venture Capital etc etc have different IC work. So here goes:   Investment Committees are fairly small sized and have on them, at the very least, the core persons that the LP\u2019s/capital providers are betting on to deliver capital deployment and returns.   Many have independent members with experience to get an external voice in the room - this also adds some comfort to LPs/capital providers. This member may, in some cases, carry a veto right.   Voting rules are various, but generally 100% yes votes is the informal or formal requirement for a yes.   The pressures on the investment committee to perform are very real:  Set of real legal responsibilities in terms of investment care and duties Personal wealth locked up in and dependent upon the investment performance Bad return performance can lead to no further funds raised Lacking care and duty in the investment process definitely will lead to no further funds.    As a consequence, this committee has a heavy hand on the full deal process, its analysis, negotiations and decision-making. It directs and decides.   The deal teams, ultimately serving the Investment Committee, are set up ad-hoc from the pool of talent in the fund based upon availability and skill, and each active deal is appointed a Deal Lead. The Deal Lead is often a Partner sitting on the IC - or at least very close in career to being capable of sitting on an IC.   All deal processes I have seen have roughly 3 major decision \u201cgates\u201d and the IC\u2019s heavy hand is seen in all:   Gate 1: Do we want to start investigating and shaping a potential deal? I.e Do we allocate internal manpower to this deal and start a deal team?  A deal appears from somewhere (investment bank/advisor usually) and gets to a senior fund member. Phone calls are made to check it out, An Analyst may do some analysis - and ultimately a small document is written on the deal and put up to the IC. It is discussed on IC - often it is sent back for a bit more investigation and another round of discussion on the IC - but within a few weeks it is either a yes or no.  At this Gate the IC is basically evaluating whether the core, inescapable, parts of the deal make sense (i.e. market space, competition, economic outlook, partners etc), sit within your mandate and theory of value creation. And, importantly, whether you think you can shape this deal into an attractive one. Because no deal starts out perfect - you need to believe the counterparties and the underlying economics and structures will allow you to shape this deal into an attractive one.  But let\u2019s say IC votes yes, the deal-team is formed and away they go. The target is to either kill the deal quickly, should deal-breakers be uncovered, or, more slowly, get to an attractive term-sheet with appropriate underlying logic and analysis.   Gate 2: Should we sign the term-sheet? I.e. Do we accept the deal as it stands and are willing to spend the money on necessary advisors (legal/audit/etc)?  As you can imagine, the process between Gate 1 and 2 is an iterative one, with a large information/analysis flow moving between IC and deal-team. The best functioning IC\u2019s I have seen, have weekly discussions on active deals: Deal-team presents where they are, what is troublesome, what works etc etc and the IC questions and directs until such time the IC decides to pull the plug on the deal - or a term-sheet has been negotiated with sufficient logic, analysis and attractiveness for the IC to vote yes on it.  I want to emphasise that this rather intense interaction dynamics between IC and Deal-team is an essential feature of a good deal-making process.  Deal-teams can easily get lost in the trees and may need help thinking about the forest. Hard for the deal-team to not develop some degree of disinclination/inclination towards the team for day-to-day interacting with \u201cthe other side\u201d that may be more emotional than rational. IC members are the ultimate party to decide and so, of course, must constantly course-correct the deal-team in respect of what is important to analysis (and what is not), and how deep to analyse etc.  Only the IC can determine when a term-sheet is sufficiently attractive and so must constantly input, guide and debate this point with the deal-team so what is being negotiated is moving in the right direction.  From my observations, when this positive dynamics between IC and deal-teams are not working properly - i.e. information flow is small, interaction limited, conversations less than frank, direction unclear etc - the fund is up a certain creek without a paddle. Does not end well.  You will, from time to time, make changes to the deal-team \u201cin-flight\u201d - Sometimes the dynamics in the team just doesn\u2019t work or you spot a bad dynamics between the Deal-team and the \u201cother side\u201d. We want to squeeze out emotions and personalities from the Deal environment as much as possible. The process is, by its very nature, already quite \u201chot\u201d . Let\u2019s say we get to yes on the term-sheet and the deal-team can now start engaging the lawyer/auditors/accountants/consultants and try to get to a deal closing.   Gate 3: Should we sign the final agreements and execute? I.e. do we execute the transaction - or not?  The intensity of interaction between deal-team and IC does not decrease between gate 2 and 3. It actually increases as new loads of info from third-parties are coming in and you need to consider if that is enough or you need to dig deeper. Also, of course, because the devil is indeed in the detail - the specifics, not actually detailed in the term sheet, of the legal agreements and structures can have immense impact on the deal\u2019s viability. Whilst the core of the deal is negotiated in the term-sheet, there is still plenty to disagree about in the final agreements - and as such to discuss between IC and the Deal-team.  But, in more cases than not, a well-designed term-sheet and pre term-sheet analysis, ends in final agreement being approved and executed. (when this is not the case, the fund drowns in broken-deal expenses.)     The IC doesn\u2019t just meet and discuss at these deal meetings. Substantive informal comms happening between members of course.   I probably need to clarify that IC members do not just sit in the deal review meetings, have a cup of tea, look at deal-team slides and then have a broad debate. They broadly receive all info gathered, analysis and work done by the Deal-team and third-parties and dig in - and happily between these deal reviews request further info or analysis or face-to-face meetings with key deal characters from the Deal-team. Very reasonable, as they are ultimately responsible for the capital deployment.  I will admit it can feel invasive and mistrustful when you sit on the deal-team side of this dynamic, but - as said - IC is responsible, so you just have to suck it up.   How much digging? As deep and wide as you can imagine. From my experience - just as incomplete examples:   You definitely check the financial models, the scenarios and assumptions - and spot check formulas and data sources. When the model is large enough you are almost bound to find items you need to discuss (and yes I have found errors - deals move fast so sometimes the deal-team just skip a beat).   You read as much of the raw-material as you can (i.e. interview notes, work notes, financial reports, third-party analysis, audits etc) and think hard about whether the conclusions drawn from them are appropriate or thin and need further evidence etc. After doing this for some time you sort of know what are the most important parts for deal success (i.e. what causes this deal to perform and what causes it to fall apart) and so you focus a lot of time on these in respect of the raw material to review and the conclusions to critically assess.   Often there are persons who provide key industry interpretations that a part of the deal decision logic relies on (go/no-go). You will want to speak to them directly to see if you agree with the conclusions.   Obviously - what you are buying/investing in etc usually has some sort of a senior team - it goes without saying that you will want to speak to them and test them out a bit. Some I know also makes a point out of always visiting the asset being acquired.   You will be all over the final agreement details and the specifics of the term sheet.     Just as with boards, the individual strengths of the members of the IC somewhat determine emphasis in this process. I.e. one is very strong in financials/statutory reporting/etc and you know he will dig very deep so you can perhaps relax a bit on that aspect. Another knows all about operations mgmt and so he takes the lead on that etc\u2026   One related point is what you could call \u201cduty of care\u201d. You know that in today\u2019s world CEOs/Boards can\u2019t fundamentally cover themselves behind \u201cmy staff said this or that and I trusted them\u201d - i.e. you cannot \u201coutsource\u201d your responsibility and you have a duty to check all is running as it should. It is in practice (and potentially legally) the same in funds and with the IC: you cannot cover bad investment decisions or behaviour behind \u201cmy Deal-team said it was all good\u201d. The IC retains the responsibility and has a duty to check that all is as it should be. Obviously above IC/deal-term dynamics and concerted \u201cdigging in\u201d efforts get you quite far down the road of having satisfied reasonable duty of care requirements, but as IC member you will have to review the deal with the \u201cduty of care\u201d glasses on from time to time - and certain before signing the final agreement. I think most IC members have their own little checklist. Something like: Did I read all the principal documents? Did I speak directly to key parties? Did I spotcheck some of the raw data vs analysis? Did I see the following key original documents? Did I visit the asset/company? Etc.   \u2026and that\u2019s that. I hope some it spurred some new thoughts. @Doo_StableLab / @flipflopflapdelegate ",

Thank you Allan for putting together this write-up on the work and best practices for ICs. I also imagine that after a transaction/deal passes through Gate 3, throughout the history of the investment, the IC needs to examine the results of operations, any additional capital requirements, the RoI, budgets, forecasts and other variance reports. In other words, it just doesn\u2019t end once a deal is approved. I also appreciate the effort that is put into getting to know the senior team, and also making a \u201cpoint of visiting the asset being acquired.\u201d     Allan_Pedersen:   One related point is what you could call \u201cduty of care\u201d.

As a Recognized Delegate protecting the welfare of MKR token owners for me, is priority one. But I also understand that it comes with a lot of risk to my Delegate platform and LLC.

                    "content": "Nice. Always thoughtful. I appreciate the time and effort to draw an analogy to a structure familiar in finance. Rather than blithely tearing up the playbook, we should always be looking toward precedent/history for lessons as to how to best design systems. Ultimately, the efficacy of a system lies in in the incentives embedded within it. You detail several components of an effective IC (Independent participants, personal skin in the game, performance feedback etc.) which will be instructive for any arbiters of investment decisions. With that said, I think the more accurate analogy for Delegates is that of a Board of Directors. In my experience, ICs are typically constrained to a fairly narrow band of investment activities. Of course, some ICs have a broader remit than others (e.g. VC/PE). In any case, an IC typically oversees a principal investment fund. And MakerDAO is not an investment fund, but a complex protocol with a number of related but different businesses built atop it. Each business requires a different set of skills to understand. As these departments grow and new ones are added, the complexity will increase exponentially. Not only do I think a Board is the more descriptive analogy today, but I think the role of the Delegates should increasingly morph into that of a Board and away from that of an Investment Committee. Rather than make investment decisions at an asset-by-asset or project-by-project level, the Delegates should make strategic, more directional decisions. i.e. constitutional, hiring, firing, and budget allocations. We should increasingly seek to add delegates with deep expertise in disparate domains such as legal, credit underwriting, risk management, sustainability, software engineering, and political science/governance. As currently contemplated, each delegate is expected to not only A) somehow have a mastery of each domain relevant to the business lines of MakerDAO but also to B) be able to ingest and synthesize the context of the activities happening across each core unit. Even with core units making recommendations within their domains of expertise, as complexity grows, specialization and autonomy must grow accordingly. Just as a Board of Directors does, the aggregate skill-set of the Delegates should be well suited to the domains underpinning Maker. Ideally there\u2019d emerge a natural specialization of decision making within the ranks, with delegates deferring to those who know more about the subject domain. @Eumenes and I are going to flesh this distinction out in a post soon. (He probably does not agree with everything I\u2019ve said here\u2014I speak for myself only). But MakerDAO is ultimately growing far too complex for the current decision-making framework. From conversations with large holders over the past month, the reason they are not participating is due to the sheer complexity. Although I disagree with many components of @rune\u2019s MetaDAO package, I think many of the basic premises are accurate. Specialization and autonomy of function under the Maker roof is one. Solving MKR voting apathy is another. Rather than restructure the foundation of the DAO, I think both of these issues can more immediately and less disruptively be solved by shifting the decision making framework to more closely mirror that of a company. I recognize that many will dislike these suggestions, as decentralization is viewed as a sacred condition and this will be invariably be perceived as a suggestion for less decentralization. But we must recognize where and how decentralization makes the most positive impact, not blindly append it to all activities of import at Maker. Decentralization is valuable when it bolsters censorship-resistance. Decentralization is pernicious when it blindly blocks specialization and makes an organism less responsive to environmental conditions. Specialization is natural law of systems and should not be fought without damn good reason to do so. Complex systems do not continue to converge on specialization and hierarchy (by competence, not decree!) by coincidence. Form = function. ",
