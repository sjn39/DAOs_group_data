                    "content": " Lending Market Analysis - Cross-Collateralization Market Opportunity Executive Summary  AAVE v2 has been increasing market share vs COMP v2 and Maker since 2/24/2022. Most of this growth is in a small number of huge accounts, many of which use WBTC and ETH blended collateral. We estimate conservatively that a WBTC+ETH blended vault could increase revenue quickly by about $1.06M. This revenue estimate can be used to determine the priority of adding blended vault capability.    This analysis begins on 5/1/21 because AAVE v1 is excluded and AAVE v2 started gaining traction in late April '21 when the incentive program began. This analysis covers Maker, AAVE v2, and COMP v2 on ETH L1. As shown in the below chart (as of 4/18/2022), the general stablecoin lending market has declined fairly significantly since late 2021. Only recently this trend began to reverse, and most of this recent growth comes from borrows that are greater than $10M. Also shown in this chart is a tangential insight that industry-wide, the vast majority of stablecoin borrow is from borrows of at least $100K.  1482\u00d71008 122 KB  However, this growth is coming almost exclusively from AAVE (as of 4/18/2022):  1452\u00d71136 116 KB  As shown below (as of 4/18/2022), AAVE V2\u2019s stablecoin lending market share has been significantly increasing since February 24th, 2022:  1392\u00d71130 113 KB  We have looked at each individual AAVE v2 stablecoin borrower who has had at least $10M of net stablecoin borrow on any day since February 24th with the aim of assisting in answering the following question:  Why are these entities using AAVE instead of Maker?  Here are the trends we have noticed, along with how they could potentially be addressed:  Many were borrowing against a blended collateral of primarily WBTC and ETH.  Maker could prioritize the capability to offer vaults with blended collateral and open one with WBTC and ETH   A fair portion were borrowing against just ETH. The relatively high ETH supply APR of 0.43%, most of which comes from ETH borrowers borrowing against stETH, effectively subsidizes the stablecoin borrow APR by about 0.7-2%, depending on LTV.  Maker could prioritize the capability to offer offer vaults with rebasing tokens as collateral and open one with aETH   Some were borrowing stablecoins against stETH or a mixed bag of stETH and ETH.  Tough to address this without potentially reducing profit from our existing stETH vaults as users were likely receiving better loan / liquidation parameters on AAVE.    The most prominent trend noticed is the first regarding blended collateral of WBTC and ETH. This is also likely the one that persists the longest - we don\u2019t know how long it will be popular to borrow ETH on AAVE, but it is likely that some end users will always prefer to borrow against blended collateral. For this reason, we decided to dig into blended collateral and have looked at two datapoints, as of 4/20/2022:  25.8% (dollar-weighted) of Maker borrowers of at least $100K are borrowing against multiple types of collateral. This amounts to ~$814M of borrow. Note: Maker vaults that were not formed via DS Proxy contracts were excluded from this analysis, as it is not possible to ascertain ownership of those. 37.9% (dollar-weighted) of AAVE v2 stablecoin borrowers of at least $100K are borrowing against primarily WBTC and ETH. Namely, at least 20% of their collateral is in each, and at least 90% of their collateral is in sum of WBTC and ETH. This amounts to $1.003B of stablecoin borrow.  There is clearly a gap. $94.5M of borrow would have to flow from AAVE v2 to Maker to to equalize the dollar amount borrowed against multiple collateral in Maker with the dollar amount borrowed against WBTC+ETH in AAVE v2. It is also noteworthy to mention that it would take significantly more movement to close the gap in the two percentage datapoints above: 25.8% on Maker and 37.9% on AAVE become 28.0% and 35.6%, respectively, if this $94.5M of borrow flows from AAVE to Maker. I would also like to emphasize here that the dollar amount gap is actually larger, as we are looking at all types of mixed collateral on the Maker side but only WBTC+ETH on the AAVE side. Regardless, we will assume the gap is $94.5M to err on the side of conservatism. Let\u2019s assume half of this gap is closed (and also ignore how much more market share AAVE takes if we do nothing, to be conservative). This would assume a conservative $47.25M increase. At the 2.25% blended average rate that $100K+ WBTC and ETH vaults have (as of 4/20/2022), this would cause an increase in interest revenue of $1.06M. As previously discussed within the DAO, implementation of blended collateral could be very straightforward via Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse, specifically implementing the D3M to a Maker Fuse pool (with WBTC and ETH as collateral). Featuring this pool on our front-ends so that end users have the same user experience as they would have when opening a regular vault seems very much within reach as well. Conclusion We estimate conservatively that a WBTC+ETH blended vault could increase revenue quickly by about $1.06M. This revenue estimate can be used to determine the priority of adding blended vault capability, which seems to take a relatively low level of effort if we use Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse.

I don\u2019t think this will hamper D3M\u2019s ability to drive revenue, as it will largely only affect those borrowing ETH against stETH on aave. From what I\u2019ve seen, most of the cross-collateral on aave is WBTC and ETH. Some market participants may be just as comfortable borrowing against a combo of WBTC and stETH instead, which did just get more attractive with this move due to the more lax liquidation threshold for stETH. May make it a bit tougher to take cross-collat market share from AAVE but there\u2019s only one way to find out ",
