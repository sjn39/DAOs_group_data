                    "content": "This post summarizes an as-of-yet unwritten EIP for a compromise on ProgPoW. It has been created solely by myself, Ben DiFrancesco, without the input or suggestion of any other persons or entities. The intent of this post is to share the idea, collect said input, and gauge community interest. Should such interest materialize, a formal EIP would be created. A Note On Compromises By definition, a compromise entails an agreement where neither side is fully satisfied with the result. That means\u2014 if you have a strong opinion on ProgPoW\u2014 you won\u2019t be happy with this proposal. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a workable path forward for the community, so please don\u2019t dismiss it outright. Motivations As succintly and fairly as possible, I aim to present the motivations of each group below. Pro-ProgPoW (PPP)  Ethereum should strive for ASIC resistance because it\u2019s part of the social contract as defined in the Yellow Paper. Specialized hardware is inherently centralizing. It places the network at risk of being 51% attacked by secret ASIC\u2019s, and/or disrupted intentionally while attempting to transition to PoS in ETH 2.0 by miners with mis-aligned incentives.  Pro-Status-Quo (PSQ) All consensus breaking upgrades are inherently risky, none more so than a change to the PoW mining algorithm. Thusly, the burden of justification lies with those proposing a change, and the threshold of such justification is very high. Based on the current state of the network, and on the unsettled state of the research related to ASICs and security, the Pro-ProgPoW arguments fall well short of the necessary threshold. Goals This proposal aims to balance the security concerns of the PPP group with the risk aversion of the PSQ group. The security concerns of the PPP group are (to date) theoretical, but if we wait until attacks are observed to take action, it may be too late to avoid serious harm to the network. Conversely, if the PPP group\u2019s concerns never actually materialize, then we risk serious harm to the network by implementing an unwarranted change. The proposal does not aim to resolve the PPP group\u2019s belief that ASIC resistance is an immutable part of Ethereum\u2019s social contract (labeled #1 in the PPP Motivation section). Ultimately, this contention is a value judgement, one that each individual must evaluate for themselves. The Proposal  ProgPoW should be fully implemented and tested across all major clients. ProgPoW should not be included as part of any planned or future upgrade hardfork. All clients should include a command line switch which enables ProgPoW at a block height specified by the node\u2019s operator. A ProgPoW enabled hardfork of the Ropsten testnet should be created and maintained using this switch. (Up for debate: should this fork be a new, parallel testnet, or should it simply replace Ropsten). A strong Schelling point should be encouraged in the Ethereum community: if clear evidence of an ASIC-lead attack on the network is ever demonstrated, Ethereum stakeholders will coordinate to activate an emergency ProgPoW hardfork, at an agreed upon block height, using the switch.  The Reasoning Both the PPP group and the PSQ group share a desire for Ethereum to remain secure and decentralized, and to successfully transition to Ethereum 2.0. By fully implementing, testing, and maintaining compatibility with ProgPoW\u2014 and standing ready to activate it in the case of an emergency\u2014 we can coalesce on a solution that focuses on these common goals. The existence of a fully implemented, tested, and easily enabled ProgPoW would serve as a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of any would-be malicious miners. If they\u2019re altruistic, it does them no harm. If they\u2019re inclined to attack or to thwart Ethereum 2.0, it changes the incentive structure of any such attempt. Put simply, it acts as a deterrent ",

Compromise is a very legitimate way to do this within the current system.  A few notes:  This entire proposal may not make sense to have be an EIP. I think what should be done (coordinated further by this discussion) is 1) Move EIP-1057 to Accepted 2) Write a Meta-EIP coordinating the Ropsten fork. These make sense given the current EIP process, and aligns things up nicely for the political process to occur most efficiently. The political components of this discussion (this post, the letter called EIP-2538, other writings and posts spanning the entirety of this discussion) should be collected together in a reference-able format, perhaps a blog post on the Ethereum website. The agreement should be achieved on an ACD call by having people from both sides of the discussion come together and formally agree on this being the path forward, mentioning the work they\u2019ve done in aligning the community down this path.

I\u2019m a little weary about giving the nodes the option of which block height to activate, because that can cause a consensus nightmare and unplanned/unprepared-for network splits. But if we can work around the switch as more of a flagging mechanism than activation mech that could work. A strong signal to help the nodes coordinate, which is typically managed by the ACDs but puts them in a precarious decision on highly political proposals. I\u2019d like to also relay some of the risks those against ProgPoW are concerned with from my own perspective. This is my own list so anyone else can add if they need:   All hard forks carry significant risk of an unclean activation resulting in a a chain split whether they are contentious or not. This is why coordination is so important and having everyone from mining nodes to service nodes  on the same page as far as planning and supporting the new chain. I don\u2019t believe we have the coordination to execute this HF cleanly given a subset of the mining nodes cannot support it and have no option but to continue mining blocks under the old rules. Service nodes, like Infura\u2019s, generally take a conservative approach, upgrading at the last moment to avoid any release bugs/issues from impacting them. It\u2019s likely some end up on the ethash chain at least temporarily, causing all sorts of confusion and uncertainty. This is even greater an issue during political HFs as they take a wait and see approach.   There will be a chain split. There is no question of that. There is hashrate that cannot upgrade so their will be blocks mined on the prior chain. How long that lasts for is anyone\u2019s guess and is dependent really on there being zero economic incentive to mine it any longer. With that all but certain, there is a high likelihood of opportunists seizing the chance (perhaps in coordination with the ASIC manufacturers) to ensure the chain survives by getting it listed on an exchange. There are very deep pockets involved and the listing fee on many exchanges is relatively small by comparison to the potential earnings (see BCH). If someone paid the \u201cdonation\u201c to Binance, they\u2019d all but guarantee the ethash chain never dies, as speculation can sustain it. Additionally, the state itself is valuable. There isn\u2019t much work needed, if any, to make things like Uniswap just work on the new fork. Thst said, the fork isn\u2019t something we can really prevent now or later on, it\u2019s a permissionless system, but rushing to make it happen now is IMHO not worth the risk of destabilizing Ethereum and pushing projects, users, etc. away due to a loss of confidence.   The concerns over the transition to PoS are largely unfounded speculation. ASICs can play information games and fork the chain at any of the upcoming planned forks, but it would not be in their economic interest to do so until the final fork to enable full PoS, as they will still reap rewards from Ethereum through Phase 2 and the migration of ETH 1 state to an EE in ETH 2. It\u2019s more likely they simply sustain the PoW chain following the transition, which, to be honest, is their right as a marginalized party (ETH 2 marginalizes all miners to the point of irrelevance). Additionally, the idea that massive GPU operations will not play similar games or sustain the Ethereum PoW chain post transition is a naive assumption that minority coins or illiquid GPU mineable coins provide a stronger incentive for GPU miners than a fork of Ethereum, with all its valuable state and pre-built dapps/defi infrastructure. If this were the case all minority fork would have no hashrate and be dead on arrival, and we know that\u2019s not the case. So long as some actors have the means and motive to keep the PoW fork alive, it will be valued in the market. To this point I see now reason why we fork now, versus then. If we fork now, it\u2019s likely we will end up with 3 chains come PoS transition, vs 2 if we simply do nothing. Each surviving fork carries the potential to dilute Ethereum\u2019s network effects, as well as place significant burden\u2019s on those developing atop it.   The dApp developer / user burden. Every fork of Ethereum in which the prior version does not die, carries a burden for those building atop Ethereum. I would ask everyone to read Alex Van de Sande\u2019s piece on that subject: https://medium.com/@avsa/avoid-evil-twins-every-ethereum-app-pays-the-price-of-a-chain-split-e04c2a560ba8   This sums up my primary reservations with the ProgPoW fork in general. If we can find a workable compromise, such as what Ben has proposed, I think it\u2019s worth analyzing. ",
