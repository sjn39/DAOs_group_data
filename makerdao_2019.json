                    "content": "MKR holders, MakerDAO and Maker users are losing at least millions $ of value per year and risk losing even more due to the curbed risk estimate accuracy. Reason: key risk model inputs are rough round CONST guesses with no data or research validation behind. The status quo has been cemented by the fact that risk management has been invariably run by the private contractor Block Analitica with no competition or even outside methodology audit. Block Analitica\u2019s unchallenged monopoly has gatekeeping incentives worth $2.76mln/year. Risk management is Maker\u2019s crucial component. Stability Fees, Debt Ceiling, System Surplus Buffer levels, collateral and arranger onboarding and Maker\u2019s overall solvency are dependent on its accuracy and quality. Maker\u2019s risk management has invariably been run by Risk CU, but de facto by a private company Block Analitica (BA). BA\u2019s risk model optimises around the assumed necessity to withstand two price drops per year at exactly 45% for WBTC, 50% for ETH, and 60% for all other volatile assets. These assumed figures have no connection with the changing DeFi environment, no data or research validation behind. They are just rough round CONST guesses. Not risk estimates, but plugs in the absence of ones. Importantly, on the other hand, past performance is not indicative of future results. If MakerDAO is building the most robust lending platform possible, we can\u2019t base risk modelling on the assumption that even the worst-case past scenarios won\u2019t be surpassed in the future, as is assumed in the BA\u2019s framework. That\u2019s just not justified by the history. Paradoxically, Maker is currently significantly limiting itself without gaining any guaranteed stability.  Recently I initiated an effort aimed at gradually replacing these CONST guesses with variables, whose values are learned from data on DeFi community activity and onchain txns. I start with a tool for probing DeFi community sentiment \u2013 a crucial risk factor for highly speculative and volatile crypto assets. This will increase risk estimate accuracy => bring risk modelling and protocol parameters closer to the reality. This will fix key shortcoming in the BA\u2019s framework. To illustrate: if ETH-A Jump Severity goes only 50% => 45% and Jump Frequency 2 => 1:   Risk Premium at current Debt Exposure: 0.3% => 0.1%;   Maximum Debt Ceiling (Risk Premium = 10%): $500M => $740M;   Capital at Risk: $632,500 => $210,833.    And here comes the governance bottleneck. Admittedly, my proposal is rather technical. So, the first (natural?) reaction of the community members was to seek BA\u2019s judgement on the proposal\u2019s merits. There is a clear conflict of interest worth $2.76M/year here. Block Analitica serves both as MakerDAO\u2019s unchallenged risk management contractor and the goto judge/reviewer on risk-related proposals questioning their approaches or presenting alternatives. BA\u2019s reaction to the proposal was skeptical and curt: they did not comment on the shortcomings of their own approach and their impact on the protocol, DAO and users, but rather misrepresented the impact of the proposal on Maker\u2019s risk exposure and expressed skepticism about its scientific validity. I was also informed that they have different priorities. I addressed BA\u2019s questions on the proposal\u2019s scientific validity and its urgency for MakerDAO both from the high level POV and zooming in. However, nobody has ever reviewed or audited scientific validity of BA\u2019s own framework. Block Analitica has never faced competition in terms of funds allocation. Moreover, BA\u2019s framework has never been scrutinised with the same questioning:    MIP55c3-SP11: Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication   If you find some empirical research where that\u2019s been validated in a meaningful way, please do share.   On top of that, I approached delegate @Doo_StableLab (disclosing with his consent), who seemed particularly skeptical. I offered to have a call, where I could address doubts, clear up ambiguities, explain details. He declined arguing that he would let the governance decide with voting. This reasoning is surprising to say the least. It\u2019s him, the delegate, who is the governance. MakerDAO pays him $12k/month, not a small amount by any account, to look into the essence of any proposal and come to an unbiased and measured conclusion. To refuse to have a 30 min call => get to the bottom is hardly in the MakerDAO\u2019s or MKR holders\u2019 interests. Block Analitica\u2019s (Risk CU) most recent budget saw a 26% increase over 6 months and reached $2.76M/year ($230k/month). On top of 2400 MKR over 3 years. And this is in the bear market times, when other CUs are being deprecated or squeezed. Note, Risk CU focuses only on market risks. E.g. operational risks remain uncovered. For this kind of money MakerDAO could get a lot of risk management, far better than now. Competing proposals scrutinising and disrupting the incumbents are in the best interests of MakerDAO, MKR holders, and protocol users. @rune @Porter_Smith @humancapitol @brettlyons @cnoyes @paraficapital @alexhevans @Recognized-Delegates ",

                    "content": "@pvl you have been attacking our methodology for weeks despite our team responding to you multiple times. Clearly you want your proposal to succeed and you started this thread to question our company\u2019s risk management capabilities. On capabilities and methodology I started Block Analitica more than 2 years ago when Maker was transitioning from Foundation to Core Unit model. Initially it was only me and @rema and I am proud to say I was able to scale the team to 10 highly skilled individuals. Not many know about us in DeFi, since we don\u2019t brand ourselves as heavily, but we managed to build the most sophisticated risk model applicable to MakerDAO and the most advanced risk dashboard. Also note makerburn.com is working under our CU. I am not going to go into details of your criticism because you are essentially focusing on a part of the model that is only one of tens of inputs, of which some are based on heuristics and high conservatism which is the key principle of MakerDAO\u2019s success and kept us safe throughout all this turbulence! MakerDAO is conservative with parameters for a reason: it keeps DAI holders safe and stabilizes DAI demand, which is the key ingredient to build borrowing capital at Maker. Also if you focused on our model more in detail you\u2019d see one of the main inputs at estimating losses and risk premiums is really about estimating and simulating how many users protect their vaults before getting liquidated, so called vault protection score. Because at the end all it matters is who gets liquidated and in what amounts. This is unique to Maker because of 1h OSM delay. We recently made improvements by using Vault liquidation ML Model and we started an ambitious project that will enable us to assign a Credit Score to each individual borrower by collecting his wider DeFi interactions (his wallet defi activity, liquidations, external capital held, tenure of debt, repayments\u2026). In short, our goal is to have full granularity on each borrower\u2019s behavior in DeFi, assign a risk score and aggregate it into risk metrics for each vault type at Maker. I can\u2019t see a better attempt at measuring risk in DeFi. On gatekeeping By your interpretation every Core Unit at MakerDAO is a gatekeeper for its own field. We have MIPs that allow any team to spin up competing Core Unit. Also if you really wanted to contribute you could step in touch with us directly and start cooperating on improvements that you saw. Instead you decided for your own budget financing (which is fine), but now you decided to attack us. As much as I can see you are a skilled individual and I built most of our team by picking talented community members. On costs Our DAI annual budget is 6th largest at Maker and I do believe we are one the main 3 CUs if you consider protocol financial safety of highest importance. Our annual aggregate 700 MKR compensation is actually one of the lowest compared to other CUs (measured per contributor) and talented DeFi Risk people are hard to find. Can\u2019t stop telling everyone how proud I am to have this current team in place because it can take years to find people familiar with Maker risk. Regarding wider industry cost competitiveness I suggest you look at proposals at Aave and Compound. Gauntlet, which is perceived as the main industry risk management service provider, charges similar amounts at each of both protocols. Yet, we offer much more: we cover all collateral evaluations, cover all the parameters, have made best risk dashboards and we even open sourced our risk models and our dashboards! When we proposed two important parameter changes to Aave and Compound recently due to ETHPoW fork (example here and here), we proposed MakerDAO to be paid instead of us. Final note To be honest I feel pretty bad I need to defend my CU after years of hard work. As said, nobody knows about us because we don\u2019t show up on podcasts and are loud on twitter. It is because we focus on risk monitoring and building 24/7. And I must say this year was quite stressful, for me personally at least. While all the CeFi lenders are blowing up because of bad risk management practices and some DeFi lending markets are being exploited due to aggressively tweaked parameters, MakerDAO has come out of this crisis without a scratch (knock on wood). To my knowledge the only bad debt accrual from liquidation event I remember in our mandate was in May 2021, about 13k DAI. ",

In fact, I find it particularly disturbing and against the interests of MKR holders, Maker users and the overall DeFi community, given Maker\u2019s role and impact, that not one question was asked about your methodology, e.g. during the last $2.76M budget approval. Feels like it was greenlit as a status quo blackbox. While some delegates are being paid $12k/month to look expertly into the proposal and evaluate its merits.      Primoz:  Also if you really wanted to contribute you could step in touch with us directly and start cooperating on improvements that you saw. Instead you decided for your own budget financing (which is fine), but now you decided to attack us. As much as I can see you are a skilled individual and I built most of our team by picking talented community members.   I\u2019ve been talking to @josolnik, responsible for data analysis, since September. Strange that you would claim the opposite. I saw big flaws in your risk assessment methodology and offered cooperation in all good faith. Jan informed me that you had different priorities. Not sure: you\u2019re either unaware of all Risk CU communications, or just misrepresenting facts.  There is a bit of contradiction in your reasoning. You\u2019re downplaying the impact of Jump Severity and Jump Frequency inputs in your model:     Primoz:  you are essentially focusing on a part of the model that is only one of tens of inputs   (are they equally weighted?) But you\u2019re also saying:     Primoz:  MakerDAO is conservative with parameters for a reason: it keeps DAI holders safe and stabilises DAI demand, which is the key ingredient to build borrowing capital at Maker.   To keep Maker constantly prepared to withstand two price drops per year at exactly 45% for WBTC, 50% for ETH, and 60% for all other volatile assets is your central \u201cconservative\u201d decision. So, it\u2019s either one of tens factors => not that important (hardly). Or it\u2019s what keeps DAI holders safe, in your view. It can\u2019t be both. I think I\u2019m focusing on pretty important factors in your model. They answer the question: what kind of challenge we\u2019re getting Maker prepared for? In fact, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re now downplaying the impact of these factors, when you\u2019re giving them in your own publication as 1st and 2nd factors used to estimate potential market shock:  Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 15.44.111428\u00d7320 32.5 KB   Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 15.44.411428\u00d7470 41.4 KB   Now, the question of healthy conservatism. There is a difference between healthy cautious life decisions based on the informed understanding of the environment and locking yourself up in the sterile bunker in the woods. In the second case you\u2019ll probably dodge  the bulk of life problems along with all life opportunities. Although you\u2019re probably still not safe from major challenges like a major war. At the moment Maker works under the assumed necessity to be constantly prepared to withstand two price drops per year at exactly 45% for WBTC, 50% for ETH, and 60% for all other volatile assets. The questions you and Jan have been dodging all along: where did you get these figures from? Why not 43.32%, 51.876%, 58.1231%? Why not 70% \u2013 that would keep DAI holders even safer. Why are they always the same regardless of market climate, good or bad? Why is Maker constantly getting prepared for these exact market shocks? Each percentage point here costs MKR holders, MakerDAO and Maker users millions $ of missed value. I can answer these questions for you. You took one biggest historic price shock for each collateral type. Rounded it up, because obviously no price movement could be = 50%. Hard-wired these rounded CONSTs into the Model. Hope they represent life behind the bunker walls. They\u2019re not connected to the live DeFi environment. Current Risk Model locks Maker up in the sterile bunker. You tighten parameter nuts with no data or research validation. As I said above, these are not conservative risk assessments, but plugs in the absence of ones. On the other hand, you just got lucky that collateral price movements didn\u2019t exceed rounded historic extremums. There\u2019s absolutely no guarantee that future problems won\u2019t exceed the past ones. History is proof to that.  BTW, where can I find Risk Model methodology description with a full list of tens of inputs? Is it outsourced?  Not to confuse things. You evaluate, what kind of shock you should be getting prepared for. Then you evaluate how prepared you\u2019re. Both are important.     Primoz:  We recently made improvements by using Vault liquidation ML Model  and we started an ambitious project that will enable us to assign a Credit Score to each individual borrower by collecting his wider DeFi interactions (his wallet defi activity, liquidations, external capital held, tenure of debt, repayments\u2026). In short, our goal is to have full granularity on each borrower\u2019s behavior in DeFi, assign a risk score and aggregate it into risk metrics for each vault type at Maker. I can\u2019t see a better attempt at measuring risk in DeFi.   Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find Vault liquidation ML Model in your repo. Is it outsourced? I, myself, am working on vault-level ML modelling and would be particularly interested to learn how you captured non-Euclidean invariances of vault-level DeFi activity. It\u2019s not trivial and crucial in this case.      Primoz:  By your interpretation every Core Unit at MakerDAO is a gatekeeper for its own field. We have MIPs that allow any team to spin up competing Core Unit.   In theory. Happy to explain the mechanism one more time: you\u2019re Maker\u2019s sole contractor on all things market risk. At the same time you\u2019re a goto judge/reviewer on all things market risk. When a proposal challenging/questioning your methodology pops up, community members refer to you for judgement, including some delegates, who are paid to be independent and qualified judges on proposal merits. There is a clear conflict of interest.      Primoz:  Gauntlet, which is perceived as the main industry risk management service provider, charges similar amounts at each of both protocols.   Gauntlet, btw, is asking to be disrupted. They\u2019re running their modelling on the assumption of 100% market rationality (GBM for asset price trajectory == Efficient Market Hypothesis) and agent rationality in their simulations. And they\u2019re certainly not delivering value worth their price tag. Funny that you\u2019re giving Gauntlet as a benchmark. ",

Maker had plenty of CUs onboarded and also offboarded as you are aware. So I find it odd that you are framing the discussion as the community is not enthusiastic about your idea because of conflict of interest. There\u2019s a likelihood that the community might not be supportive because they simply do not find it significant. ",

We might want to tackle them independently.  Governance  Does the Core Unit framework + Delegation Framework allow for fair competition, or are incumbents at an advantage? Who is checking or auditing the work done by Core Units? Should delegates do this? Should external teams do this? Should Core Units not need to defend their annual budget? Would some audit deter talent from joining the DAO (as they don\u2019t want to be scrutinized in the open)? Should the people making the decisions for the protocol be the same as those providing the protocol\u2019s services?   The Risk Framework  Is the current risk framework appropriate for Maker and the current conditions? Should the risk methodology be public and open source?   Block Analitica  Is Block Analitica doing a proper job assessing the risk? Is their price aligned with the market (could Maker get a (significantly) better deal keeping the same quality?   Here comes Endgame! The first two sections are addressed in the Endgame Plan. Through Scopes and Frameworks, Maker is supposed to create \u201copen recipes\u201d that deal with these concerns you point out, separating the experts (which are the \u201cbuyers\u201d in a way) and the providers (Ecosystem Actors, Sub/mini/MetaDAOs). Regarding the last section, I can only say that Primoz (and the whole BA) has always behaved professionally and responsively to Maker\u2019s needs and urgencies. Not being an expert in Risk makes me unqualified to address your other points, so I\u2019ll leave that to the bigger brains out there. Thanks again, and please don\u2019t let our Governance deter you from contributing. We\u2019re trying to make it better. ",
