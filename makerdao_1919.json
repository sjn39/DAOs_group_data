                    "content": "Hey all, In light of recent events in the crypto ecosystem and surrounding uncertainty regarding financial stability and asset liquidity of various entities and their possible relations with token governed protocols, we are proposing following temporary emergency measures:  Decrease MATIC-A Debt Ceiling from current 20M to 10M Decrease LINK-A Debt Ceiling from current 25M to 5M Decrease YFI-A Debt Ceiling from current 10M to 3M Decrease renBTC-A Debt Ceiling from current 10M to 0  When the situation becomes clearer and the environment less risky, we (@Risk-Core-Unit) or either MOMC will propose further parameter changes to adjust parameters based on the future state. While we do not necessarily want current positions to unwind, we want to limit further possible exposure. Exceptions where debt unwinding is preferred is  MANA-A. RenBTC has high tail risk due to uncertainties around current market conditions. We also propose proceeding with the aforementioned parameter change for MANA. Despite borrower reacting and topping up its collateral a few days ago, we think the debt exposure is still too high compared to on-chain liquidity. MANA-A:  Decrease Debt Ceiling to 3M from current 10M (pending current executive vote execution) Significantly increase SF to 50% from current 7.5% (pending current executive vote execution) Increase liquidation penalty to 30% from current 13%     Do you agree that Maker should take the urgent actions listed above?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This expedited Signal Request will run for 24 hours until 2022-11-12T18:00:00Z as per MIP24c4. If a majority is in favor, the Governance Facilitators and Protocol Engineering Core Unit will post an out-of-schedule Executive Vote to the Governance Portal once this Signal Request has ended. cc @Recognized-Delegates @Core-Facilitators ",

The downside to this is it erodes confidence in Maker as a reliable, long term actor. Sudden and large changes to the parameters of our vaults should not be an easy or frequent occurrence. The need for large and sudden changes shows that we engaged in excessive risk taking. I want to add that this is severe detriment of the conditions for vault users. As such it is my opinion that this urgent executive comes with an extraordinary responsibility to warn. We should immediately start to signal our intentions to the wider cryptosphere and to vault holders in particular. ",

It looks like we\u2019re trying to create liquidations and take as much as possible for ourselves, as oppose to just de-risking the protocol.   Yes, good question. Higher penalty fee can protect Maker when it comes to partial liquidations. The auction\u2019s throughput for MANA-A was set to only 1m due to liquidity concerns. It is quite possible that the first few tranches liquidated might carry less slippage than the subsequent ones. Therefore collecting more fees on first few tranches can safeguard Maker from potential loss in other tranches when price could spiral downward. And as said, we want this user to unwind before getting liquidated so we thought of proposing both SF and PF sufficiently high for him to react.     lyt:  It seems that link has more on chain liquidity than matic. I just checked a yield aggregator and a $10M sell has a fair amount more slippage for matic than it does for link   Partially because main vault user at MATIC-A maintains 961% collateralization ratio and partially because  CEX liquidity is far better for MATIC-A (even though I agree on-chain liquidity is of the most importance). Also it is really more about limiting further exposure than reducing it (MATIC-A has 14m exposure already and limiting DC temporary to 5m or 10m won\u2019t make a difference). ",

Its very clear that the MPC holds reserves and can easily be verified. I would still vote for a reduction to zero just to be safe and maintain MakerDAO, but under the requirement of a future plan to raise the limits later, and possibly faster after completion of a new audit. Ren will be upgrading to version 2 in the next few months, so let\u2019s limit exposure to tail risks of engineering and plan to bring assets back in the future. I would in general caution labeling everything Alameda touched as toxic in a market witchhunt. I really do want to support a decentralized wrapped BTC, but I understand not doing it right this second. ",

The non regular parameter changes therefore accomplished the wanted result as exposure is much more appropriate given current liquidity and ongoing crypto CeFi financial/liquidity crisis which also impacts permissionless protocols to a lesser degree. Risk CU will therefore recommend altering MANA-A parameters in the next week\u2019s regular MOMC meeting to levels which reflect the new state. We will also initiate a discussion surrounding possible changes to the design of how stability fee functions in relation to maximum debt ceiling and its utilization for less liquid assets. Because we want to minimize similar interventions, we believe that an interest model similar to what is currently used in lending markets could highly optimize the alteration of parameters based on fast changing factors for less liquid assets. For clarity, we want to assure the community that MakerDAO is completely safe and was at no point in an unsustainable situation regarding on-chain collateral assets. Even in the case of a larger market drawdown, the current surplus buffer is more than sufficient to absorb all potential bad debt from less liquid asset exposure. The Maker protocol and community has demonstrated strong robustness once again. ",
