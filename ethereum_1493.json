It appears to be desirable to have something like this in place already for the merge, to avoid (or at least greatly reduce) throughput degradation due to missed slots, or even due to potential consensus issues. To maximize the chance of this EIP being included in the merge fork, the adjustments are kept to a minimum, with more involved changes discussed in the rationale section.   github.com/ethereum/EIPs         Time-Aware Base Fee Calculation   ethereum:master \u2190 quilt:time-aware-basefee            opened 03:59AM - 29 Oct 21 UTC               adietrichs             +158 -0       This EIP proposes to modify the base fee calculation to take block times into ac\u2026count and target a stable throughput per time instead of per block. Its aim is to keep changes to the calculation to a minimum, only introducing a variable block gas target proportional to the block time. The EIP can in principle be applied to either a proof of work or a proof of stake chain, however the security implications for the proof of work case remain unexplored.       ",
