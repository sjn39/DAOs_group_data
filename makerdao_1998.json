Monitoring notes Strategic Finance has started to take over RWA monitoring. No evidence of any monitoring by the RWF facilitator have been found. @roo , credit analyst, will take the lead n the next few months. Community should expect it will take a few months and be an iterative process without all collateral under consideration initially.  Collaterals  MIP65 - Monetalis Clydesdale Exposure to MIP65 was $401M at the end of November. The value of the underlying portfolio was $400M, the difference being some setup and transaction cost. For instance, we paid 15bps (600k at end of the period) for the Swiss stamp duty. Community should consider a 30bps friction when we buy or sell. Reducing this friction is obviously important. We are currently earning a bit north of 4% on those asset after arranger and custodian costs which represents 1.6M DAI per month (at 500M exposure). Exposure is 2/3 0-1yr maturity and 1/3 1-3yr maturity.  image798\u00d7354 18.5 KB  The Dune dashboard provide more informations and we are working on a more detailed and accurate V2.  HVB HVB is now in green territory thanks to interest earned on idle cash. Loan outstanding are 17M out of a 100M facility.  image1089\u00d7533 31.2 KB  After we finish to stabilize New Silver monitoring, we will move to HVB. For instance, some label are still a bit unclear and we don\u2019t have loan characteristics. No monthly audit call was performed. Dashboard (still under construction)  New Silver New Silver is close to 13M exposure. We performed a monthly audit call and found nothing to report. We still have due diligence on the manager to perform. @roo will perform a credit assessment regarding the debt ceiling increase.  image840\u00d7846 60.5 KB  ",

Totally agree with this. I have not been paying close attention to our RWA methodologies, but am curious as to how often do we take profits from all these RWA efforts. It definitely is desireable to take profit as often as possible to realize our profits and get an ROI for our investment. ",

I deduct 15bps for Monetalis and 5-10bps for custody. This is what I look at instantaneous looking forward earnings which is what make sense business-wise. I leave you to define whatever earning you want. Finance has move towards fair value through profit or loss, for instance in IFRS 9. For historical PnL, we plan to recognize earning when they hit the Surplus Buffer. Not because it is accurate (which it is not), but because it is more convenient and simpler to understand. Off-chain accounting should be a temporary thing before everything moves on-chain. Community can follow the discrepancy between what is recognized in the Surplus Buffer and the actuals with the report, ideas is that with one payment per month it remains very small.     psychonaut:  Are we getting interest on idle cash?   This is my current understanding (HVB related).     0x336c6:  What is the net exposure per maturity date after taking into account the cash allocation of individual funds?

Appreciate the response @SebVentures \u2013 I believe one of the biggest challenges / opportunities on our doorstep is to translate the same rigor with which the industry is focused on proof of reserves and proof of solvency to due diligence and valuation of RWAs. This is a step-function improvement and an entirely new model that has not existed in traditional finance, and which a blockchain-based Oracle has a unique ability to create in a trustless way. Is anyone working on this right now? Without the ability to understand underlying collateral in real-time, we\u2019re leaving ourselves at a massive disadvantage in evaluating risk. This is particularly troublesome when we consider the regulatory uncertainty around a DAO (or associated legal wrapper) being recognized in a court of law and having the ability to enter into any sort of adjudication process in the result of a margin call. If there isn\u2019t anyone working on this, I\u2019d love to help solve this challenge. ",

For instance, some label are still a bit unclear and we don\u2019t have loan characteristics. No monthly audit call was performed.  On HVB, do we have any idea what loan types were purchased? I think scaling with banks is a no-brainer, but it seems problematic that all of the exposure is concentrated with one (especially one as small as HVB) and the visibility is limited. It would be interesting to compose a bank portfolio that is more diversified across loan types, originators, and geographies. Given most banks have much more sophisticated reporting systems than HVB, think there is a real opportunity to parse loan-level data and report that to the community. These off-chain deals are essential but no reason we can\u2019t improve substantially on how we execute. - especially if we want to scale this responsibly!
