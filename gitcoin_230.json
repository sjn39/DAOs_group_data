In S16, we will continue to support key initiatives to support contributor professional development, and with budget increases to support the success of our Grants Program and Protocol development. Also, in light of recent shifts in our community engagement strategy, we will be winding down our Community Experience initiative to focus even more on cross-stream collaboration, accountability and project management across the DAO. Based on what we learned in S15, we will be focusing our resources on supporting DAO and contributor success vis-a-vis our cross-stream DAO operations, governance, tooling, people operations and success initiatives.  Amount DAO Ops requests $348,260 USD in S16. Included in the budget is a placeholder for a Technical Support hire to support our Design Partner Program and 2 months of parental leave for 1 contributor. This request does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the full budget can be found at the end of this proposal.

Milestone Report for Past Season  Success  Incomplete, will hit goal or priority change  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled - out of workstream\u2019s control     Initiative Project Key Results Status Value Delivered/Notes     Community Experience Increase engagement and satisfaction among DAO Citizens interested in our grants program or grants protocol. KR1: Increase the average weekly percentage of engaged citizens on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.  Though there isn\u2019t a way to measure engagement on Discord, the average engagement on the DAO Vibes citizen calls has increased between 66-80%.     KR2: 50% reduction in requests to change Discord logic when compared to S14  Discord Managers have been assigned for each workstream. We audited roles, optimized access, and documented the access control process.    Develop a strong \u201cWhy\u201d for community management initiatives that aligns with the DAO\u2019s Purpose. KR1: Support the MMM community engagement strategy through weekly syncs, with insights from seasonal community management audits.  The MMM community audit and strategy creation is still underway. DAO Ops is coordinating with MMM to understand what support is needed in S16.     KR2: Identify and document the community and Discord needs of each workstream.  Guides and audits are in progress and will continue in S16.    Continuing to improve how we work at CSDO level KR1: Adopt a streamlined budget process ahead of S16.  Multiple proposals were made over the past season, but at CSDO member direction, DAO Ops paused this KR in favor of focusing on cross-stream strategic decision making.     KR2: Improve the quality of cross stream meeting processes, and the documentation of reviewed and adopted proposals.  Implemented changes to CSDO meetings, including format and facilitation changes and additional process documentation. We will continue to experiment with our format and to improve transparency in the upcoming season.   Community Governance Improve community governance and steward engagement through simplified processes that streamline decision making for the largest GTC delegates. KR1: Create a clearly understood onboarding and incentivization process  A new Steward Council proposal is live on snapshot and a proposal for onboarding new Stewards will be posted before the end of October.     KR2: Launch a Governance Documentation Hub for new and existing stewards.  A documentation hub has been created and will be shared in the next Stewards meeting.     KR3: 80% of stewards and workstream leads view steward meeting structure, pacing and content favorably.  Anecdotal feedback about this meeting has been positive, and we have created a standardized survey which will be administered 1x per month. Beginning in S16, DAO Ops will track and adjust meeting structure based on feedback from this survey.     KR4: 80% of top stewards vote on 100% of formal S15 proposals.  Current Steward Council voting engagement = 62%   People Ops Ensure contributors are in the right roles, and embrace a DAO-native hiring approach that further develops well supported contributors. KR1: 100% of core and trusted contributors have received a quarterly peer review.  MMM, FDD, and DAO Ops review complete. PGF and GPC\u2019s reviews should be completed by late October.   People Ops Empower DAO contributors to grow and support our ImpactDAO and protocol development. KR1: Four or more workstreams receive compensation leveling recommendations from People Ops.  Recommendations were made to 4 workstreams. Implementation to be completed by workstreams.     KR2: Provide GPC contributors comprehensive support transitioning from holdings to the DAO.  We\u2019ve created resources and set up calls to ensure a smooth onboarding.   Tooling Ensure a coordinated and transparent software tooling approach. KR1: Deliver a recommendation for cost reductions based on a deep dive into all tools used by DAO.  DAO Ops has reviewed access for several tools transferred from Holdings, which led to removing 30+ contributors from paid tools; we have also sunsetted a number of tools that were no longer actively used. We also inventorized access to all tooling and will continue to track access and needs in the upcoming season.     KR2: Facilitate access to all control domain requests within 48 hours.  In S15, we implemented changes, including a list of tool owners that facilitated quicker responses to the requests.     KR3: Ensure that all workstreams can use Notion as their primary tool for meeting notes and outward facing workstream description by end of season.  During the season, the Tooling initiative completed project management guidelines and revamped the Notion contributor database. All workstreams have been transferred to the current structure and have the ability to use Notion.   Support Continue to implement processes that improve our grants rounds and support our transition to a protocol-focused DAO. KR1: During GR15, support tickets (Discord+Email) are resolved within 20 hours (on average).  The average handling time of support tickets during GR15 was 13hours and 42 minutes.     KR2: Current state of the Grants program and protocol development is reflected on Knowledge Base within 10 business days of changes.  40+ Knowledge Base updates completed before and during GR15.     KR3: Deliver easily used data to grants round workstream partner post-GR15.  Without many trending technical issues, there wasn\u2019t a lot of data to share with workstream partners.

I am not really convinced in how important this workstream\u2019s work is for the operation of the DAO which is bleeding a very big amount of funds in the most severe bear market we have seen in years. I am happy to see that you have unspent reserves from S15. I am not happy to see an increase in budget request during such market conditions. If I compare the salaries you guys pay they are higher than I have ever made as an opensource developer, even in good market times. I am also trying to understand and judge what exactly does the DAO gain from this workstream. Looking at the S16 commitments and the outcomes and initiatives I just don\u2019t see any of these as actually important, except perhaps the Support section which is indeed something Gitcoin should have. As things currently stand I will have to vote No in this proposal with the feedback being to recognize the terrible state of the market and the industry and adjust the budget accordingly. And to also keep only the stuff that is absolutely essential to the DAO and shed everything else. ",

Our first two seasons as a workstream included a couple key personnel moves, including several contributors transitioning to the DAO from Holdings. A couple of those moves took longer to occur than planned, which led to larger than expected rollovers at the end of each season. Then, ahead of of S15, four contributors left DAO Operations and excess funds in our multisig were returned to the DAO\u2019s treasury (about $270k).     GClayMiller:   Check out https://statbot.net/   and some of the documentation here: Understanding Server Insights   Appreciate this suggestion. Tagging our discord manager to follow up with you with questions. @kylejensen     GClayMiller:  I am a brand new steward and have not seen anything about the Steward Council calls or steward-specific channel yet!   Tagging @shawn16400 to help get you onboarded.     GClayMiller:  Are there specific KPIs you are trying to meet? Is there existing data on where bottlenecks exist, where contributors fall off, where onboarding stalls, topics that get lost between workstreams etc etc?   We don\u2019t have specific KPIs for CSDO. But anecdotally some of the important projects CSDO members asked DAO Operations to drive in S16 include:  An updated CSDO charter and DAO OS with clear metrics A streamlined budget process that balances planning with execution, and borrows from best practices in the broader ecosystem. Experimentation with workstream coordination that improves internal communications and project management (i.e., working in cross stream pod or guild structures).  Each is listed as a DAO Ops project commitment this season. ",

                    "content": "We appreciate you naming these concerns. For our part, in S15, People Operations rolled out a compensation framework that tried to balance fiscal responsibility with the ability to attract value-aligned talent. Based on those recommendations, most workstreams (including DAO Operations) re-leveled contributor pay to 50% of U.S. median salary. This ensures that all contributors, regardless of where they live, are paid the same for the same work.     griff:  I am happy to work with the Gitcoin Hiring team to explain how Giveth finds intrinsically motivated high caliber contributors in lower income countries to keep our budget at 1/10th of the cost.   But we love feedback. We have one contributor repping our hiring team \u2013 tagging @safder should you want to connect with him or if he has more to add regarding our compensation work last season.     lefterisjp:  I am not happy to see an increase in budget request during such market conditions.   If not for one projected Support Engineer hire, DAO Ops\u2019 budget would be flat, and like last season, we will look for ways to spend less than budgeted wherever possible. This is why our S15 rollover balance includes approximately $31k of unspent budget.     griff:  We have given strong warnings over the last few seasons and they don\u2019t seem to be enough.   And we\u2019ve also heard stewards on spending, only using reserves in S15, returning $261k to the DAO\u2019s treasury.     lefterisjp:  I am also trying to understand and judge what exactly does the DAO gain from this workstream.   As for our value to the organization: our commitments to the DAO remained largely unchanged in S16 in accordance with CSDO\u2019s decision to keep planning to a minimum this season. That said, DAO Ops is a service-oriented team that is constantly responding to the needs of the DAO. That means that in addition to the commitments listed above, we are also assessing a number of projects that stewards, workstream leads and contributors have already raised since the start of the season, including:  an updated treasury dashboard contributor pay survey creation of a CSDO charter Facilitated strategy sessions to set the DAO\u2019s operating system and set value proposition as a protocol and grant giving DAO.  Hope all this helps but @krrisis and I are here if either of you would like discuss further. ",

                    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful engagement here Griff, and I\u2019m very much in alignment with the need to minimize costs. On compensation/hiring, we recently went through the process of developing a compensation model in collaboration with workstreams, one that aligns incentives with performance and accountability. Currently the DAO Ops, FDD, and MMM workstreams are using this new performance-based compensation model. As Jodi mentioned, this model uses the US median for base salary numbers from the data provided by OpenComp, which aggregates salary data from hundreds of companies in its database. The base numbers here are pretty reasonable, and NOT meant to be competitive with FAANG/high CoL area tech salaries. One reason we use US numbers, and it makes sense for us to continue to do so, is that a majority of our full-time contributors are US-based. It would not be prudent to lay off and attempt to replace our entire workforce with contributors from lower CoL regions. I would note here that the costs of replacing a strong employee/contributor can be much higher than potential benefits of rehiring someone at half the cost. Here is a good read on the costs associated with turnover, and there is a lot of research that has been done on this. That being said, what is important is ensuring that compensation makes sense for the skills/experience/value each contributor is bringing to the DAO by having high levels of accountability, and I think this is an area the DAO could definitely improve. This is what the compensation model attempts to solve, as well as potentially some of the budget auditing work @shawn16400 is looking into. Would love to continue working with you as well as other Stewards in exploring how we can continue to ensure that we\u2019re only taking what we need from the treasury in the ongoing market conditions.

Here is a good read on the costs associated with turnover, and there is a lot of research that has been done on this.   I\u2019m not saying we need to fire good contributors that are making high US salaries, we have who we have and if they are performing we should keep them 100% agree. That said, it is a huge mistake to be spending so much when there is no clear business or economic model for a path forward for GTC, and setting the salary rate high for people that are hired in the future doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Fine, people are paid a lot who work here now\u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean we should maintain that policy into the future. There are incredible people all over the world that can do work just as well as someone from the states. I know because we hire them at Giveth, and they don\u2019t care that they aren\u2019t getting paid American wages. I said as much here when the idea was presented, and i\u2019m surprised it was pushed through anyway given the debate there:    A Compensation Commitment \ud83e\udd16 DAO Governance and Vision       I love many aspects of this proposal, but am skeptical of a few as well   Transparency I am neutral here\u2026 I like the ideals of transparent salaries, but in practice, i haven\u2019t found it very beneficial, so i could go either way.   Global Salary Benchmark I strongly disagree with the proposed policy.  US Base + 30% ? This doesn\u2019t make any sense in general IMO\u2026 If you are hiring a strategic expert solidity dev, you might need to pay a lot more than US base + 30%, or if you are hiring an admin from \u2026     In general we are going backwards with the approach in budgeting. We should say how much GTC and DAI we are willing to spend each quarter, given our current holdings and the macro outlook, divide that up amongst the working groups and live within our means. This is how we need to build a budget for the DAO in the bear. Right now we don\u2019t actually have a budget, our process (cynically) looks like this: Each working group spends way too much time trying to sell their work in forums and calls, then they put out a number that gets nickel and dime\u2019d by a bunch of stewards that don\u2019t have enough of an incite to really judge the request and then it gets approved eventually and we spend whatever, with no concern (at least outwardly) about how the increase in supply is going to be met with demand. ^^^ This is a fine pattern in a bull market where the macro environment can generate tangential demand\u2026 that is not where we are right now.
