It appears to be the case that most clients decided to only support eth_call even though EIP-3368 mentions the \u201cuse of CCIP read for transactions\u201d:  While the specification above is for read-only contract calls (eg, eth_call ), it is simple to use this method for sending transactions (eg, eth_sendTransaction or eth_sendRawTransaction ) that require offchain data. While \u2018preflighting\u2019 a transaction using eth_estimateGas or eth_call , a client that receives an OffchainLookup revert can follow the procedure described above in Client lookup protocol, substituting a transaction for the call in the last step. This functionality is ideal for applications such as making onchain claims supported by offchain proof data.  We think using EIP-3668 for \u201cwrite\u201d transactions is powerful, especially when combined with EIP-712 for offchain signing of payloads returned by the Gateway. What could be done to emphasize the support for eth_sendTransaction? Would it be helpful to create a new \u201cEIP - CCIP Write\u201d or is the existing EIP good enough? ",

The author thinks that using EIP-3668 for \"write\" transactions is powerful, especially when combined with EIP-712 for offchain signing of payloads returned by the Gateway. The author also asks for suggestions on how to emphasize the support for eth_sendTransaction and whether a new \"EIP - CCIP Write\" should be created.",
