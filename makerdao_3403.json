Please provide public references for the above where possible: N/A  Introduction Motivation for running a Light Feed As long time participants in the MakerDAO ecosystem and passionate builders on the MakerDAO protocol, we recognize the importance of maintaining the protocol healthy and want to further help make it more robust. Community What has your organization contributed to the crypto community? DeFi Saver has most notably provided one of the most popular alternative management apps for MakerDAO, ever since early 2019. During our time building in the Maker ecosystem we believe we both helped the protocol grow, as well as maintain its health and stability, especially through major market drops. We have also provided additional tools such as DeFi Explore (an MCD explorer akin to mkr.tools for SCD), a liquidation auctions UI, and automated SCD to MCD migration options, aiding the move to MCD in late 2019. Successful products, services, tools, libraries, thought-leadership DeFi Saver as an alternative management app for MakerDAO. (https://app.defisaver.com/) DeFi Explore as an MCD version of the famous mkr.tools. (https://defiexplore.com/) Maker auctions UI as an alternative tool for participating in liquidation auctions. (Intro post) How will the Maker Community benefit from your inclusion as a Light Feed? Being one of the most well known teams in the MakerDAO ecosystem and among the longest building teams in the DeFi space, we believe our addition as a stakeholder will help further strengthen the MakerDAO ecosystem.

In fact, let me ask: have you considered forming a \u201cDeFi Saver\u201d Core Unit to integrate even more your products with MakerDAO, and potentially be supported (to some extent) by MakerDAO? Of course you now have your own business, total freedom etc. But the \u201cMakerDAO Core Unit\u201d structure is very flexible, and it would easily accomodate for some kind of lax-integration  Keep up the great job!
