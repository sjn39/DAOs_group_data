At the moment they are not overwhelming the other threads, but I do think there would be utility in categorizing them into their own section. This would reduce noise and would increase the quality of the other major discussion sections.     Add stand-alone \u201cQuestions\u201d Category Leave the forum as is, we\u2019ll deal with it later I like having questions intermingled with discussion threads in the major sections     0 voters     ",
