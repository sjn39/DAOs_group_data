(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): We are two French content creators who have been actively producing videos since 2017.

By creating engaging and informative YouTube videos, this proposal aims to increase awareness and understanding of the benefits and features of the Optimism ecosystem, and to help grow the community and user base.  The videos will cover topics such as how to use and interact with the platform, covering projects and individuals utilizing Optimism, and updates and developments within the ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to drive adoption and usage of the Optimism platform and to support its growth and success. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Our goal is to create a series of engaging, informative videos that will explain the basics of Optimism and optimistics rollups , how Optimism works, and how users can bridge, start using DeFi, covering different dapp of Optimism.These videos will be made available on our Youtube and social media channels, and will be promoted through various online and offline channels.In addition to our YouTube channel, we also host a weekly podcast on Twitch. Our podcast features guest appearances from industry experts, project founders, and other key players in global DeFi space and Web3 ecosystems. Through our podcast, we aim to provide our viewers with a platform to learn directly from those who are shaping the future of DeFi. In return for your sponsorship, we would be happy to promote Optimism in our videos and podcasts, provide shoutouts on our social media channels. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: The value-add of these sponsorship is two-fold: first, they will help to promote Optimism and its services to a wider French and not only ETH native audience, increasing user adoption and engagement. Second, they will serve as a valuable resource for people looking to learn more about cryptocurrency and Optimistic rollups. By providing high-quality, accessible education, we aim to democratize access to this exciting and rapidly growing industry. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: Never Number of OP tokens requested: 10000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: / How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Not applicable How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): The budget will be used to support the creation and distribution of the educational content as well as incorporating Optimism branding into our videos and live streams.The funds will be allocated as follows:1. Video Production: The majority of the budget will be dedicated to the production of the six educational videos. This will include equipment, camera crew, writing and editing services.2. Marketing and Promotion: A portion of the budget will be used to promote the videos and live streams through social media channels and advertising.3. Miscellaneous Expenses: The remaining funds will be used for miscellaneous expenses such as travel to conference, software, and other production-related costs.We are committed to utilizing the funds efficiently and effectively to produce high-quality educational content that will inform and educate our viewers about Osmosis and the exciting developments happening on Optimism. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Grant timeline The grant will cover a 3-month sponsorship and will include the following:Six educational videos:- An overview of how works optimistics rollups and Optimism- A guide on how to get started with Optimism, bridging, usage of the wallets, large covering of the ecosystem- A series of video with in depth coverage of the Optimism DeFi ecosystem- A series of videos on the NFT & P2E ecosystem- Utilisation of Optimism branding in our live stream- Shoutouts for Optimism on our social media channelsWe are excited about this opportunity to collaborate with Optimism and are committed to delivering high-quality educational content to our viewers Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: To ensure that our sponsorship progress is tracked and monitored effectively, we propose the following milestones:1: First video release featuring Optimism branding and promotion.2: First podcast episode with a segment dedicated to Optimism and its features.3: 10,000 views on our YouTube channel with Optimism branding and promotion.4: After the 6 educational videos and 3 month sponsorship with shares of different tracks of impact, click, views, and new users. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: The YouTube videos produced through this grant request will help to demonstrate the value and utility of the platform to potential users, and will help to build a strong and engaged community around Optimism. Additionally, by regularly providing information and updates about the platform, the videos will help to create a sense of connection and loyalty among users, and will encourage them to continue using the platform even after incentives are no longer available. By effectively communicating the value of the platform and engaging with users, this grant request aims to ensure that Optimism continues to thrive and grow, even after incentives have dried up. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): We don\u2019t have any other grant from other ecosystem.
