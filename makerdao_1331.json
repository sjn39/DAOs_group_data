There is also a related Signal Request live right now that we would like to bring to your attention: [SIGNAL REQUEST] [BEAR] Building Financial Resilience & DAO Targets This is not a Signal Request, but an open voluntary invitation. There are good compelling business needs why some cash should and must remain on CU wallets (Oracle gas, PE continuity, one-time business-critical projects). All Core Unit Facilitators are kindly requested to:  Confirm the accuracy of actual expenses reported in the below on-chain snapshot Confirm on-chain snapshot of cash on hand and intent to return excess DAI to the DAO Provide an expense forecast through Q3 End (June, July, August, September) Return all excess cash over 3mos of monthly forecasted spend  More aggressive returns that could be possible due to underspend relative to budget will be greatly appreciated     image820\u00d7592 82.6 KB  Returning over 3mos of the budget is now part of the regular MIP40 process - this is more aggressive considering almost every CU has underspent their budget. We are kindly asking for CU proactivity in starting it early given market conditions. Doing so will not change much beyond enforcing shoring up loss-absorption ahead of Core Unit business continuity. Excluded from this snapshot are Oracle gas wallets and Foundation reserves, which bring the total balance to 15.8M. We would appreciate feedback on this by next Friday, July 8th. Thank you  On-chain process Calculation Example: Core Unit A\u2019s forecast is 100,000 DAI per month for three months. If a Core Unit has 400,000 DAI on hand, they must return 100,000 DAI to the DAO. Core Unit Balance - (3 * Monthly Forecast) = Minimum Amount to Return 400,000 - (3 x 100,000) = 100,000 Transfers should be made to the DssBlow contract, simply send a standard ERC20 DAI transaction: 0x0048fc4357db3c0f45adea433a07a20769ddb0cf  Updates on feedback from various CUs below Editing as responses come in.

In GovAlpha\u2019s case, we returned 150,050.83 DAI in June (transaction), but this has been lumped in as an on-chain expense. I get that technically it\u2019s a wallet outflow but I was just wondering if there\u2019s a better way of splitting out SB returns as otherwise, it looks like we\u2019re spending all of our budget when we\u2019ve actually been returning some to the protocol.

There are no budget cuts as those would require MIP40 processes mostly likely (governance to confirm) and that has not taken place. As actual run rates have been significantly lower than budgets this cash claw back asks essentially for the difference. What may be helpful for your planning is: forecast the next 3 months of actual (not budget) spend, compare that sum to the cash on hand in the CU wallet and return the excess. Should the SR pass and set a parameter of rNPI, it would effectively ask for a % of run rate to be further reduced. This does not affect the ask to claw back cash today. ",

But Rune and others have expressed the desire to move excess non-operational cash from CU wallets to the surplus buffer.  image1812\u00d71408 301 KB  Although we account for operating reserves as part of the surplus buffer in theory, it is true that in practice sheltering operational funds in CU wallets makes operating expenses senior to token holder funds as loss-absorption. So asking for a claw back is reasonable in this regard. This is unrelated to budgets, other than the fact the reason we have so much excess cash accumulated is that Core Units have mostly underspent relative to their budgets.

With regards to the Contingency Multisig, your Dune analytics are only reflecting DAI, but in our case we have diversified stablecoin holdings (DAI, USDC and PAXG) so should be reflected accordingly.

Enforcing such best practice means we can get back on track of building a culture of collaborating on a trust-minimizing system. Once money has been sent off to core units, there is no reason we should expect to get it back if a dispute occurs, or a market downturn, or an organically emergent internal group gets an idea for something to spend it on etc. We can trust the core units today to not do this, but we are falling into the trap of relying on the integrity of the team today to fill the gaps we leave in the workforce design. There could be plenty of legitimate reason to leave teams with buffers, but they need to be formally defined and agreed on by the community (and afaik they already are, just in a way that caused this unintended buildup). They shouldn\u2019t randomly accumulate when that wasn\u2019t the intention or expectation, and when we discover that something like has happened we need to take action to fix our mistake. ",

We originally had a burn prediction of DAI 65k per month but did not hire as much as planned because we did not need to given the context (delay on the fast withdrawals and the teleportation, delay on Starknet features). We originally planned to ask for a budget extension in July, but given the savings, we swill be able to sustain the core unit on the current budget until end of September or October (depending on exact audit cost). We will be requesting a budget extension in September which should sustain us until teleport is fully delivered. Depending on the final audit cost, our excess budget (over three months) might vary between DAI 0 and DAI 40k. Happy to answer any questions you might have. ",

                    "content": "For those that are unfamiliar, here is an overview of the SES model with the built-in mechanism for returning excess funds:  20220702-budget-flow2782\u00d71732 103 KB   Monthly Cycle The model follows a monthly cycle:   Core Unit submits their monthly budget statement with actuals and forecast for the next 3 months of their expenses to the Auditor. The 3-month forecast is based on expected invoices, so it can be significantly lower than the budget cap. For example: SES almost never expects to use the full incubation program budget because it rarely runs at full capacity.   Auditor reviews the budget statement, and once it is approved, the reconciliation happens: a) DssVest funds are pulled from the protocol. b) The Core Unit\u2019s operational wallet(s) is/are topped up to the level of the 3-month forecast. If there is an excess amount in the operational wallets already (more than the 3-month forecast), these funds are returned to the Auditor wallet. This can happen if big expected costs are cancelled. c) Once the top-up is completed, any excess funds in the Auditor Wallet that exceed 2 months of budget cap are returned to the protocol via DssBlow.    Cash Buffers and Claw-back Abilities If this process is applied strictly, this results in the following buffers (ignoring only administrative delays in forecast updates):  Less than one month budget cap buffer in the DssVest contract. Less than two months budget cap buffer in the Auditor wallet. Less than 3 months forecast buffer in the Operational wallet.  In terms of claw-back capabilities:   The protocol is the beneficiary of the Auditor wallet which allows it to claw back these funds following a governance vote.   The protocol is sometimes the beneficiary of the Operational wallets in which case it can claw back these funds too. This depends on what the core unit proposed in their MIP40.   This setup seems reasonable from a number of perspectives:   It gives the core units enough runway so that (1) they can be confident they will be able to meet their obligations towards contributors and external service providers and (2) business continuity can be guaranteed, including in the event of a Maker governance deadlock.   It has accountability built in via the transparency reporting requirement that the operational top-ups depend on.   It gives the protocol the ability to claw back funds and relinquishes control over less than 3 months budget cap (how much less depends on the variability of the expenses, i.e. the difference between forecast and budget cap).   The DssVest stream limits the total spending rate to the budget cap as a hard guarantee.   Note that, in order to initiate this setup at the beginning, MIP40s have typically included a one-time seed transaction to fill the buffers that are mentioned in the process before the DssVest stream kicks in.  Participating Core Units Core Units that are following this setup are SES (auditor is GovAlpha), DUX, SAS, IS, TECH, and RWF. Changes in the buffer parameters (runway lengths) would require a MIP40 update of these Core Units. DECO follows a similar flow, but the funding model is quite different and does not depend on actual expenses. Instead there is a fixed maintenance fee and a profit sharing clause that kicks in once the maintenance fees have been repaid to the protocol. Budget statements:   SES \u2013 auditor: GovAlpha  DUX \u2013 auditor: SES  SAS \u2013 auditor: SES  IS \u2013 auditor: SES  TECH \u2013 auditor: SES  RWF \u2013 auditor: SES  DECO \u2013 auditor: SES  Currently we\u2019re using GitHub to publish these. This will soon be made more accessible as we are working to make them available via the Performance Dashboard (included in the first release.)  Note on the Auditor role The auditor\u2019s responsibilities have been restricted to objective, formal transparency reporting checks by design. What this means, is that the auditor makes sure that the core units are reporting their expenses regularly, and that they check the numbers add up before their operational runway is replenished. Additional clarification is requested from the core units when the expenses exceed the budget categories\u2019 caps (for example due to cashflow delays or pre-payments, unforeseen costs, etc.) The auditor does not make any judgement calls on whether or not the funds are spent responsibly or wisely. For example, the auditor is not involved in negotiating fees with contributors, much less in judging whether the fees are reasonable and fair. Similarly, the auditor cannot prevent outright fraud if a core unit decides to lie in their transparency reports.  Action Items Action items relevant this forum thread:   In the past, DssVest pulls haven\u2019t always been executed when it was possible to avoid, often to save gas costs. Excess funds have typically been left sitting in the DssVest stream rather than returned through DssBlow. I have asked our auditors to strictly apply the process going forward so that the maximum amount of funds are returned to the protocol (but also pulled).   We\u2019ll be working with SF to make it easier to have live access to the data and connect it to the on-chain transactions that are taking place.   We\u2019re working with the core units (1) to improve the timeliness of the reporting and (2) to ensure that forecasts aren\u2019t overly conservative in covering unlikely future expenses.   We are continuing the work on our budget tooling and DAO performance dashboard to remove the manual overhead from the process and make on-chain verification of the numbers trivial.   ",

TL;DR with an un-budgeted expense over the next month we do expect to use all our vested funds. Details: We were running below budget in the beginning (2021) due to some of our service still being provided by Maker Foundation, and the board not being at the budgeted 7 members. OTOH we are now experiencing higher than budgeted expenses. This is due to:  We budgeted Techops costs before the Techops CU was created, and the costs have been slightly higher (Much tools and process work have been completed this year, and the outstanding work will be spread out so we have agreed with TechOps to reduce this post notably in the new budget) Trademark legal expenses have been higher than budgeted We did not budget to pay VAT on any services. While a company can deduct VAT from their expenses this is not the case for a non-profit organization, so we have to pay VAT for our EU based service provider expenses The budgeted time for facilitator work was minimal and it has been necessary to use more time on facilitator work Finally and importantly, we have a significant un-budgeted one-off expense: For the reserves our assumption was that we could add these to the foundation base capital and then if needed move them to be operational capital. It has unfortunately turned out that the authorities do not allow this, so if we added the reserves to the base capital they can not be used for \u201coperational\u201d expenses and thus not serve their purpose as stated in the budget \u201cto have a \u201cwar chest\u201d to cover extraordinary expenses or temporary issues with funding of day-to-day operations.\u201d. To keep the reserves available indeed as reserves that are ready for a critical situation, we have to pay an estimated un-budgeted amount of $185k DAI in taxes. We have certainly taken this learning into account and have made sure to adjust our new budget such that we won\u2019t be hit with any tax on the reserves buildup for this next period.  ",

April 2022: The report states a 110k DAI spend as opposed to the actual spend of 105k.

June 2022: 1801 DAI difference which can be explained through a purchase of 1 ETH on June 7th, of which 0.3 ETH is sent to one of DUX team\u2019s CU members to fund his signer wallet (ie. the wallet used to execute all DUX CU multisig transactions)  Also, the report states a current DAI balance of 285,081 DAI, whereas the actual DAI balance of our operational wallet at time of writing is 204,599 DAI. Our monthly budget statements are accessible by anyone, are audited by SES, and can be verified together with our team\u2019s multisig (ie. \u2018operational wallet\u2019). Compliance with SES model As the first incubee of SES we fully comply with the SES model for budget management, with SES being our assigned auditor. They perform checks on our monthly financial reports and control the auditor wallet which sits in between the Maker Protocol and our team\u2019s multisig wallet. Based on the model\u2019s prescription we will never have more than 3 months of budgeted runway in our operational wallet (ie. the wallet that is within control of the DUX CU members). Refer to Wouter\u2019s elaborate reply for more information about the checks & balances built into the model. Lastly, we\u2019re currently being onboarded as one of the first CUs to start using the SES transparency dashboard. The dashboard will aggregate CU information, including monthly financial reports and roadmap updates. Q3 forecast and buffer Over the third quarter of this year I expect our CU\u2019s monthly spend to average out at 115k DAI/mo, taking into account the payment of an annual contract (RPC endpoint provider), the preparation of our 2nd (and last) team offsite, and some one-off legal fees. Right now we have less than 2 months of runway sitting in our operational wallet, and therefore we won\u2019t be returning any funds as part of this initiative by SF CU. As we do not have control over the DssVest buffer and/or our Auditor Wallet, we refer to @wouter\u2019s commitment regarding these funds (as quoted below).     wouter:   In the past, DssVest pulls haven\u2019t always been executed when it was possible to avoid, often to save gas costs. Excess funds have typically been left sitting in the DssVest stream rather than returned through DssBlow. I have asked our auditors to strictly apply the process going forward so that the maximum amount of funds are returned to the protocol (but also pulled).    (edit: added correction to DAI balance) ",

I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re super relevant for this thread if they span only one month. In general, most of our reporting is currently reflecting cashflow. For example: security deposits that will be returned on a later date are reported as expenses. It\u2019s a potential area of improvement on our reporting that we can have a look at in the future. It definitely tends to muddy the reporting. But for now, we\u2019re still streamlining the basics. This will improve the timeliness of the financial reporting, which in turn will reduce the differences between cashflow reporting and expenses. ",

                    "content": "Indeed, believe this phasing difference is due to the difference between cash movements visible on-chain and reported expenses which may come closer to an accrual basis. Still useful nonetheless to double check our queries, thank you @0xdeniz and @wouter. I\u2019m starting to come around to the view that blockchain accounting might always be expressed on a cash or at best a near-cash basis. Being able to record something as simple as a non-cash depreciation expense requires an incredible amount of assumptions around trust, contracts and enforceability. For an on-chain protocol, it is always more conservative to assume that once a value has changed it has changed for good, until reversed. SES\u2019 wallet setup helps in this regard, as would some form of automatic enforcement of cash returns to the surplus buffer. ",

A more effective improvement might be to better identify all cash buffers and make this information easily discoverable and accessible to stakeholders. ",
