                    "content": " MIP13: Declarations of Intent  Preamble MIP#: 13 Title: Declarations of Intent Author(s): @LongForWisdom Contributors: n/a Type: Process Status: Request for Comments (RFC) Date Proposed: 2020-05-12 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: MIP0 Replaces: n/a   References MIP13c3-Subproposal-Template.md MIP13c4-Subproposal-Template.md  Sentence Summary MIP13 introduces declarations of intent, which allow Maker Governance to signal an intention to the wider community.  Paragraph Summary MIP13 introduces declarations of intent, which allow Maker Governance to signal an intention to the wider community. MIP13 defines a list of Active declarations, and the processes required to declare, revoke and modify declarations. These declarations can help to inform DAO members or the Maker Foundation as to the issues and priorities that Governance considers to be important.  Component Summary MIP13c1: What is a Declaration of Intent? Describes the desireable properties of a Declaration of Intent, and the considerations that should be made when creating or modifying one. MIP13c2: List of Active Declarations A list component which contains a list of the currently active declarations of intent. MIP13c3: Declaration of Intent Process A process component that allows Maker Governance to create, replace or amend-through-replace a declaration of intent. MIP13c4: Revocation of Intent Process A process component that allows Maker Governance to revoke a declaration of intent.  Motivation MIP13 is designed to formalize and expand on a pattern of behavior that has appeared consistently in the Maker Governance community. This pattern of behaviour tends to look like this:  Recognise that something should be done. Discuss the problem. Vote in some form to ensure that a majority wants to do something. Hope someone does the thing.  We\u2019ve seen this pattern come up multiple times, across multiple different subjects. Three examples that come to mind are:  The shutdown of SCD. The introduction of ranked on-chain voting. Compensation of vaults that lost money on Black Thursday.  In each of these cases, there was no formal record of the declaration of intent beyond an on-chain poll and the various forum threads that led to the decision. By formalizing this process in MIPs, anyone wishing to interact with Maker Governance can easily discover what has been agreed on various topics in one place. In addition there will be a record of when each declaration took place, and the described reasons for it to have been declared.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP13c1: What is a Declaration of Intent? Definition A declaration of intent is a statement that declares an intention Maker Governance has to the wider ecosystem. Such declarations should be made with the aim of prompting action in a certain area. There may be other ways to use \u2018Declarations\u2019 outside of intention, this system could be generalized to declaring other concepts, such as beliefs, or goals. However, based on the principles of specificity and brevity, it is suggested that these variations are defined as separate MIPs if they are determined to be needed. Specificity Declarations should be worded carefully to capture the intention of Maker Governance as precisely as possible, however, that does not mean that declarations must always be specific and precise. There may be times when Maker Governance does not care about the implementation details used to solve a problem, only that the problem is solved. There may also be times where Maker Governance has already discussed possible solutions to a problem and already aligned on an implementation to a point where they would accept only that specific implementation. Declarations of both types (and anything inbetween) should be considered legitimate, but Maker Governance should take care to make it clear where each declaration lies on the scale between these two extremes.   MIP13c2: List of Active Declarations This list can be amended through subproposals created under MIP13c3, MIP13c4 and MIP13c5. Entries into this list should follow the following template: Declaration Statement: Sub-proposal Number: # Date Ratified: (yyyy-mm-dd)  Note that the subproposal code should link to the relevant subproposal. Active Declarations List There are currently no active declarations. Below is an example declaration which should be removed (as should this paragraph) when the first ratified declaration is added to this list. If there are no active declarations, the example declaration and this paragraph should be restored. Declaration Statement: All Governance Facilitators should be given chocolate on the 30th of February each year. Sub-proposal Number: MIP13c3-SP0 Date Ratified: 2020-02-30    MIP13c3: Declaration of Intent Process MIP13c3 is a Process MIP component that allows MKR Governance to create, replace or amend-through-replace a declaration of intent through a subproposal. If a declaration of intent is ratified through a MIP13c3 subproposal, it should be added to the MIP13c2 list by a MIP Editor. If the subproposal defines a declaration to be replaced then:  That declaration should be removed from the MIP13c2 list by a MIP Editor The replaced declarations subproposal status should be changed to \u2018revoked\u2019 by a MIP Editor  MIP13c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Feedback Period: 4 full weeks  Frozen Period: 1 full week  MIP13c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP13c3-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified if this MIP moves to Accepted status.   MIP13c4: Revocation of Intent Process MIP13c4 is a Process MIP component that allows MKR Governance to revoke a declaration of intent through a subproposal. If a declaration of intent is revoked through a MIP13c4 subproposal then:  That declaration should be removed from the MIP13c2 list by a MIP Editor. The revoked declarations subproposal status should be changed to \u2018revoked\u2019 by a MIP Editor  MIP13c4 subproposals have the following parameters:   Feedback Period: 4 full weeks  Frozen Period: 1 full week  MIP13c4 subproposals must use the template located at MIP13c4-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified if this MIP moves to Accepted status.  ",

I see nothing regarding closure of a Declaration of Intent, nor whether we also will maintain a complete list not just of active DOI\u2019s but ones that are formally closed and what the actual payment was vs. what the bounty offered was. Example:  Poll for compensation for Black Thursday people had a DOI in effect for someone to do a compensation report that included a bounty of up to 2000DAI.   I took on that bounty in effect and was paid 4000DAI.   I think we should record stuff like this somewhere and think at least with the DOI\u2019s perhaps a MIPXc7-Subproposal-Template.md That looks like (excuse the formatting my time is limited here) Declaration Statement: Sub-proposal Number: # Date Ratified: (yyyy-mm-dd): Date Completed: (yyyy-mm-dd): Bounty Offered: Bounty Paid: Closure Comments: Now I am thinking we are going to have to have governance close these or can we have a DOI manager being some EPC to do it? All of this is making me think perhaps we need a MIPXc7:   DOI closure, payment disbursal, recording via MIPc7-Subproposal-Template.md. but I honestly can\u2019t think straight atm to write up something. I do see the above is somewhat covered in submitting a MIPc5 for closure listed in MIPc6.   I was thinking here more of the formal MIPX: DOI closure process and then recording the payment and closure date and creating a dataset of formally closed MIPX\u2019s generally as a record of work.   We may also want to record revoked DOIs as well as rejected DOIs. ",

Regarding making contracts there has to be some sort o severability clauses or contractual obligations.

MakerMan:  also will maintain a complete list not just of active DOI\u2019s but ones that are formally closed   Good point. I did think about adding this, but talked myself out of it on grounds of length. We certainly could have a list of \u2018completed\u2019 and/or \u2018revoked\u2019 declarations. I\u2019m not sure we would need an additional subproposal for those lists though. Maybe just amend to them and link to the MIPXc4 and MIPXc5 subproposals?     MakerMan:  Do we need a section regarding partial Bounty compensation if someone is working on a revoked MIP i.e. MIPXc4? Or at least how this is handled?   As written, it isn\u2019t really handled. I added a point in MIPXc6 along the lines of \u2018Make sure the thing you want to work on isn\u2019t going to get revoked.\u2019 I think this is probably something that can be handled using the Protocol DAI Transfer generic MIP?     MakerMan:  I am not sure if we can just treat these DOIs as \u2018bounties\u2019 where one completes or gets nothing.   I\u2019m not entirely sure either, but it struck me as a good first-pass version of this MIP. In the future I\u2019d hope to have some sort of escrow system and more details. Would want to get more feedback from others on this. Adding more detailed logic here will require a more complex MIP, which is the downside.     MakerMan:  I see some of this is handled in MIPXc6 so perhaps add something regarding above there?   MIPXc6 is probably the weakest section. Once this moves to RFC I\u2019d be happy for people to contribute changes to this or other components in the MIPs github. ",

Arrgh.   Not really a simple solution here except to leave these as bounties and put the onus on the bounty hunter(s).  I feel like we may not get too much work done here or it will not be well co-ordinated so there is no duplication of effort.   i.e. what if two people take on a DOI? etc.   What if one starts and another finishes?   This is particularly true of large projects that likely will require multiple individuals or a team to be assigned and someone act as the DOI project manager to account for and disburse funds as well as take on repsonsibility for completion. Do we literally need a manager to mange the bounty hunters efforts?   Deal with bounty hunters bailing on a project, assigning new ones, etc.  All sounds ugly - like middle management. ",

Meaning if someone decides to take on the MIP the deposit is held in escrow for them in case the DOI is revoked and this is why the bounty hunter needs to make sure the DOI is not revoked.   Yeah, this is the direction I was thinking this could evolve into in  a future iteration.     MakerMan:  Not really a simple solution here except to leave these as bounties and put the onus on the bounty hunter(s).   Pretty much. This was the simplest method of incentivisation I could think of for this sort of thing.     MakerMan:  What if one starts and another finishes?   This one is at least answerable. Whichever finishes it creates a MIPXc5 subproposal and puts both his address and the other guys address in, with a split he thinks is reasonable. If they end up arguing about it, Governance can just not payout to either until they come up with something that both can agree on.     MakerMan:  Do we literally need a manager to mange the bounty hunters efforts?   I think that ideally someone would keep track. In some respects it can be approached from the low maintenance angle of \u2018see if someone presents something that meets the criteria and is worth paying for, if so, pay them the bounty. If it doesn\u2019t end up getting done, increase the bounty until it does.\u2019 Part of the hope is that whomever authors the MIPXc3 subproposal wants to see \u2018their\u2019 intention get realised, and so will work with bounty hunters working on it.

To address your points:     andytudhope:  it really requires a point-person with the technical knowledge required to judge whether a given piece of work satisfies the declaration of intent   Hm, I think it would make sense if the person that authored the initial Declaration of Intent did this in some cases? MIP13c5 allows the division of the bounty between multiple addresses. I\u2019m unsure whether to include this as a requirement in the MIP though, it adds complexity and length and I\u2019m not sure it is necessary in all situations. Furthermore, I think it may prove to disincentivise people from running them if they are required to overseer the work. One of the advantages to having the system be as open and non-restrictive as it is currently defined is that these structures can evolve naturally. A project manager type person can take on the role of delivering the Intention to the satisfaction of governance and award themselves a share of the bounty from doing so.     andytudhope:  It\u2019s [having to wait for bounties] a deeply unattractive feature imo   I agree, but I think this can be overcome by just offering larger bounties. The issue with putting funds under the control of an overseer is that that overseer needs to be trusted. Ideally some smart contract can be in control of the funds, and they can be released partially as milestones are completed. Unfortunately this adds technical complexity to this MIP, which I\u2019m not sure its desirable in this initial version. I really want to just get something workable ratified, and leave room for iteration and improvement in later versions of the MIPs. If you can think of a way of adding an overseer role in such a way that is:  Safe (with regards to funds) Incentivised (so people want to do the overseer job) Does not add too much technical complexity (as few smart contracts as possible) Does not add a barrier to entry.  I\u2019d be happy to discuss and work on an improved version of this with you in the future. That said, I don\u2019t think that should stop us from ratifying this version as soon as possible. In combination with MIP14, I think there is enough flexibility here that we should be able to handle most cases with what we have. MIP13c3 can be used to amend-by-replace declarations of intent to reflect agreements between bounty hunters and someone in the \u2018overseer\u2019 role. Any additional payments (for example for audits) can be covered by MIP14. Worst case scenario from ratifying this asap is that we decide on a bunch of intents and no one does them because the terms are too unfavourable. Anything else should be able to be solved with the tools available in MIP13 and MIP14. ",

However, if we just specify that the author of the Declaration of Intent is responsible for reviewing and testing the submission, and that the DAI drawn to fund any DoI is sent to a StandardBounties contract which the author can release (or not), then I think that improves things massively. We would likely need to add that, if the Gov Community is happy with the work, they can optionally choose to reward the author with ~10% of the bounty as a separate payment in the next cycle, which will take longer (but is less of an issue as the author is likely to be more embedded in the gov community than any bounty hunter).

                    "content": "Nice to see you here! @owocki  On the topic of bounties platforms, I think it would be an interesting experiment to use a combination of a bounties platform and this MIP to shape a process for how a future open/decentralized workforce could operate. For example, let\u2019s say there exists an elected/dedicated white label solution of a bounties platform and a MIP is ratified that defines processes for how to propose requests for work, get elected, and paid. A possible process flow could look as follows:  Bounties for Maker Protocol or DAO work are proposed on the platform by community members or domain teams The bounties go up for an approval vote Bounties are approved Workers apply to work on the approved bounties Workers are approved (by domain team greenlight and governance) Work begins Once work is completed, the respective domain teams verify the work Once verified, payment is sent out through the platform to the worker (done through governance, where the paying address would be the dedicated address that Dai is sent to from the Maker Protocol).  In terms of concerns with a process like this, I suppose the main one would be with the security of the funds being held in the platform and how they would get distributed upon the completion of work. What do you think? (cc @andytudhope @LongForWisdom) ",

                    "content": "So I feel like there are a couple of options here with regards to the issues brought up by @andytudhope @MakerMan and others. Option 1: Remove the bounty-related sections from this MIP, and have this stand as a way to declare intents without defined bounties. This avoids any potential downside from an inadequate bounty system. Add a bounty system in a future replacement of this MIP. Option 2: Rewrite this MIP now to include a better defined bounty system, either integrating with gitcoin bounty contracts, developing something else, or defining additional roles that manage the process. Option 3: Keep the MIP as is with regards to the bounty system, and hopefully get it ratified as a first pass version of a bounty process. Create a second, more robust version to replace this MIP in the future, using the usage of this initial version to inform changes. Of these, I favour Option 3, but would be willing to go with Option 1 if there is widespread opposition to the bounty portion as written. Option 2 I dislike, because it will mean a greater delay to getting this MIP ratified. If we have to integrate a full bounty system, I would not expect this MIP to move into Formal Submission earlier than August, and possibly much later than that. I would love to get people\u2019s input on which route this should take. It\u2019s hard for me to tell from feedback how strongly people oppose the MIP as currently written. Do people still view this as net-positive? Or do people think this will actually cause more problems than it will solve? Here\u2019s a poll to make feedback super easy.      Option 1 - Remove bounty-related sections of this MIP to avoid possible negative outcomes.  Option 2 - Rewrite this MIP to include a more robust bounty system (bearing in mind this will likely delay ratification by several months).  Option 3 - Keep the bounty system largely unchanged, and improve upon it in a future version of this MIP.     0 voters     ",

The unique features here are:  The Approval vote process Charles outlined, which I think would be really awesome to see. Anyone can propose bounties, and governance votes on relevant ones each cycle (i.e. month), and then funds them. Funds coming directly from the protocol itself, hence the concern over safety. We\u2019re going to suck DAI and send it directly to a specified address. Should be easy enough to create the bounty first, then fund it like this, no? Potentially a group of reviewers/green-lighters. Should be easy to handle through multiple Approvers no?  @charlesstlouis I think approving workers can fall to MIP editors for now (i.e. it\u2019s just an admin step that requires looking at reputation scores and browsing GH profiles to get a sense of real skills). Potentially can fall under the remit of others later on. ",

Anyone can propose bounties, and governance votes on relevant ones each cycle (i.e. month), and then funds them.   Worth noting that this process of voting + funding should probably be an atomic operation, as in the approval of the bounty comes in the form of funding for said bounty     andytudhope:  I think approving workers can fall to MIP editors for now   I think I disagree with this, could you not make approval of a specific worker its own subproposal? This would give the opportunity for the worker to pitch themselves and their plan to complete the work to the community at large. Would lead you to a process something like the following:  Intention + Bounty proposed using subproposal. Intention + Bounty proposal accepted by governance. Interested workers submit subproposals to governance. One of these subproposals is accepted by governance (And this sets the target address in the bounty contract but does not yet release funds?) Work happens. Final subproposal submitted by worker which governance approves if they are happy that the work fulfils the intention.  You could potentially delegate one or more of these steps, but eh, delegating responsibility for any of these to a single party is risky, imo. Delegating choice of worker is open to abuse. Delegating when to release funds is potentially also abusable, but less so in that it requires two malicious parties to abuse. Delegating to multiple parties in a multisig setup is probably secure enough though, and could be worth investigating. ",

Funding the intent means an \u2018intention\u2019 by governance to ACT.    Let them fund intentions and figure out how to do it.   In the loosest sense I am getting tired of wiping governances butts here trying to catch all and be all. First rule of MIPs right.  DO ONE THING.    Declaration of Intent is just that - intent.   How or whether governance chooses to fund intents - lets leave that for another MIP related to funding activities or some such. I totally understand the desire to make this into Declaration TO be DONE but I think your Declaration of Intent as it stands without funding for the bounty amount is fine.   WE DO want goverance to declare what they believe the bounty should be - they can argue these as they come - later use funding MIPs to fund the things. Honestly your wonderful DOI MIP LFW really makes much more sense from this perspective than trying to deal with the money part of DOI\u2019s.   Lets baby step these in a way that keeps them simple.   DOIs with a proposed bounty desperately needed.  If governance doesn\u2019t fund them - they basically sit DOA but who knows maybe someone will decide to take on a DOI simply because it was already within perview of other work they were doing and then once done solicit for bounty payment to release the work to the DAO. As to MIP Editors dealing with the bounty and people side of this.   I really have a concern MIP Editors are going to end up with a tremendous amount of power here if we start putting a lot of funding decisions or personnel choices within their domain. I think the rest of the mechanics of how DOIs are dealt with are ok.   Just leave a hook for DOI bounty funding to another MIPX DAI Funding or some such. ",
