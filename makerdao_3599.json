The Dai loan is paid back with results, but unlike other vaults, it can pay back more Dai that it borrowed. MakerDAO takes some risk.  The Core Unit might not pay back the loan in full by getting results that outweigh the funding.  The Core Unit\u2019s reputation could get liquidated and MakerDAO lose some funds. How likely are these outcomes? How like that the funds could be wasted or worse? How likely is MakerDAO to get results that repay the loan and more? Since the collateral type is the reputation of the Core Unit team, that needs to be evaluated. It it Core Unit made up of anonymous people? Is it composed of people with a good track record, anonymous or not? As the post-Maker Foundation landscape emerges, campaigns have broken out over the debt ceiling of a proposed Core Unit vault type. I think we can say for certain that governance will not be uninteresting. ",
