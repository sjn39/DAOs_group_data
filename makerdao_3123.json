                    "content": " Preamble MIP13c3-SP#: 9 Author(s): Yaron Velner (@yaronvel) Contributors: n/a Status: Withdrawn Date Proposed: 2021-1-05 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Declaration Statement: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol. Declaration to Replace: n/a   Specification  Context and Motivation  Maker, and the DeFi ecosystem in general, has conservative collateral ratios (CR), in order to mitigate potential failures in the liquidation process. High CRs narrows the potential user base, and the potential profit from stability fees (SF). B.Protocol introduces the concept of a backstop made of committed liquidators, who get priority in the liquidation process, in return to their commitment. B.Protocol is live since October 2020, backstopping over $18m of ETH-A collateral and $6m debt. Few successful liquidations were already done. In ETH-A collateral B.Protocol is an opt-in system, where users can decide to manage their Vault with, and give priority to the liquidators. B.Protocol liquidators in return share some of their proceeds with the users who give them the priority. In particular, it requires the user to interact with a new set of smart contracts. An experiment is proposed for a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B or ETH-C, with lower CR than WBTC-A or ETH-B (respectively), which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop.   Committed backstop design For simplicity we describe a system with a single liquidator. Scaling the system for multiple liquidators, in a permissionless way, will be handled by B.Protocol, and it is not in the scope of this writeup (we presented some ideas on how to achieve fairness here). We illustrate the protocol with an example of WBTC collateral, $5M ceiling, and 0 liquidation penalty, however, this is only for the sake of illustration, and it is not part of the declaration of intent Initialization: the liquidator opens a Vault with $0.5M WBTC deposit, and 0 debt. We denote this liquidator\u2019s Vault with lv. Liquidator can withdraw collateral or increase his debt, only if his net position (collateral minus debt) is over $0.5M (according to MakerDAO price feed). Liquidation: when calling bite to an unsafe Vault v, then if v==lv, or lv does not have a net position of $0.5M, then v is subject to a standard liquidation process (by the cat or the dog). Otherwise, the entire position of v is forked and added to lv. The user of v is losing all his collateral (which is effectively a maximum of 10% penalty). lv get all the user collateral and all of the user debt. The bite function is callable by anyone.  Declaration Detail Maker Governance declares its intention to experiment a native integration with B.Protocol. Namely, to on-board a new collateral that gives a priority(*) in liquidations to B.Protocol, in return to an on-chain commitment of B.Protocol backstop liquidators through an on-chain crypto-economic incentive (**), towards successful liquidations. (*) If B.Protocol fails to liquidate a Vault, then the Vault will be liquidated by the standard Maker keepers, like today. (**) Liquidators who fail to liquidate, will incur an economical cost. Further, it is the governance intent that:  The development work will be done by the B.Protocol team, to the satisfaction of the Maker\u2019s smart contract team. The collateral oracle will be recommended by the oracle team. The risk parameters, namely, the CR, debt ceiling, and auction parameters (if still applicable) will be recommended by the risk team. Stability fee and liquidation penalty will be discussed again with the community, in the form of signal requests.

                    "content": "I managed to find the vaults. Out of 175 vaults, only 118 deposited ether at all. Only 22 of them have more than 100 ether in collateral, the top 1 vault represents 31.5% of all collateral and the top 5 represent 70%. Out of the top 30 vaults (>50 ETH) majority of them were migrated from normal MCD vaults. You can find them here if anyone is interested. The #1 vault immediately stands out due to how big it is compared to others and also how active the owner is across wider defi, but it is also the only vault which is currently maintaining low CR (~160%), other vaults seem well collateralized. In regards to Keepers, and the recommended blog post, it seems currently B.Protocol is integrated with FPR (feed price reserve) based reserves in Kyber Network only. Those are also the largest FPR reserves in Kyber currently, namely; Anonymous Reserve, OneBit and Kyber FPRv2. As mentioned in the blog post, the Anonymous Reserve is also an old Maker Keeper, while OneBit and Kyber are new to the table. As seen here, Kyber Reserves hold 160k dai, OneBit holds 140k while Anonymous holds 2.7m. In total, new Keepers brought ~300k dai. There is an additional issue. In instances of severe dai liquidity crunch, reserves would get dried out, as the price of dai would spike. The reserves of dai for B.Protocol are the same as dai reserves in KyberNetwork. ",

What is special about professional liquidators, is that they have robust hedging systems. e.g. see here. In the current version, our keepers are in best effort more without a strong commitment. In the proposed Vault they will lockup collateral, that will be lost if they fail to liquidate.   Eventually a system like Maker need to make it possible for liquidators to profit. And asking high capital lockup is not an efficient way to do it. Now please take a look at Maker auctions. Check how many players participated there (spoiler, around 3, and normally 1 wins everything, if you filter smart contracts that are used by multiple senders). See how much capital they have. And what kind of commitment they have during times like black thursday. Anw, what we propose is to have Maker keeper as the ultimate backstop also in this RFC. ",
