The goal of my research is to provide the community with a better understanding of trust in the field of blockchain that should ultimately lead to better dApps and more adoption. To collect the data for my research, I am conducting a survey and I would very much appreciate it if you would fill out my survey. The cool thing about the survey is that it is a dApp itself. This means that a smart contract is managing the survey and conducting an automated lottery at the end. The lottery raffles of 5x50\u20ac in MATIC. The only thing you need to participate in is a MetaMask account. Link to the survey dApp: SurveyApp If you want to check out the source code of the smart contract, you can find it here: Contract Address 0x6da6ee8d5d56b578994c4ce111d0ff73746dfbe0 | PolygonScan I am looking forward to your opinion! Please also feel free to ask me questions about the survey tool, we have created the tool especially for this survey to make questionnaire research a bit more exciting again  ",
