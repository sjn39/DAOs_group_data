Welcome to the MakerDAO Meet Your Delegate meeting #06. I am LongForWisdom. Today we have the chance to talk to newish potential recognized delegate GFX Labs.     Christopher Cameron and Getty Hill  Delegate Introductions  01:00  1920\u00d71105 187 KB   PaperImperium: this is Getty Hill, one of the big cheeses at GFX labs, and we are here to answer your questions.  Getty: Thanks, guys, for having us here today. I\u2019m looking forward to getting involved in MakerDAO Governance more. It\u2019s been wild for me since I was involved in the world of MakerDAO, and I missed the days aside; you guys have quite a complicated protocol these days. We\u2019re glad to have Chris joining us, helping us navigate the world of MakerDAO, and understand all its ins-and-outs and what can be improved, where we can add value, and try to do some incredible things. We like to participate in other protocols and build cool cross-protocol integrations and a bit participation. I think everyone knows very well that the world of DeFi is a pretty small one so that we can do pretty neat things in the grand scheme of things.   We\u2019re looking forward to answering questions you have for us; if you guys want to hear more about what GFX Labs is doing outside of the governance space, happy to talk about that.       Questions  Can you give us a summary of the platform? 03:08  Getty: The general gist is we\u2019re a team of builders. Everyone on the team is, especially when it comes to Governance matters, we believe. We\u2019re not trying to go out and do a million different protocols and be a name that we get to throw around and say: \u201cwe did 20 different protocols of Governance, and we made a proposal on each of them\u201d, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about, I\u2019ve been involved with Compound, that was the first DeFi protocol that I fell in love with, but by far, and over time, have branched out into many others. We used a lot of them.  The beauty in our team especially is, we don\u2019t have a mandate to make money. Of course, some of you would have to make money. We are a startup, but we don\u2019t have the same type of purview in the grand scheme. We\u2019ll probably get votes from some of the funds, or the hope is to get delegate votes from them. Generally speaking, they\u2019re all very kind, and they understand that we\u2019ve done good work on these other protocols. We\u2019ve driven value; we\u2019ve helped improve the protocols. They don\u2019t ever really message me and say I got to vote this way. You got to vote this way. You should do this or that. They understand the gist: that we\u2019re going to drive value. We looked for our compensation on a protocol basis. We realize that this is an emerging field and that there will be many more questions and answers. Our stick is we\u2019re going to take the initiative; we\u2019re going to find places where we can add value; we\u2019re going to start small and build into it. We hope to do some meaningful things. In particular, what the governance team looks like today. We do a lot of things at GFX, and governance is part of it. The governance team right now is Chris. Another nice guiding face shaver on the FADE protocol, who does protocol stuff, myself for doing Compound UniSwap. We do all of these, each of us individual one, but then we help audit each other\u2019s decisions and thoughts and proposals on each of them. You see that we\u2019ve been posting and voting on all the different polls that are coming through. Chris has been doing an excellent job and helping the rest of us who aren\u2019t so familiar with MakerDAO to understand all the different polls in digesting that information. We\u2019re using some of the knowledge we have from other protocols to be like, Hey, we should be doing this or that, how can we improve? That\u2019s a decent general overview of the governance efforts and our platform. Chris, do you want to add anything?   PaperImperium: No, but responding to some questions in the sidebar.   Astro: Why would I want to go from having my contract to working with GFX? 06:18  PaperImperium: GFX will receive the delegation pay for this contract? Because there\u2019s a cut to the chase of this line of questioning. You know, why would I want to go from having my contract to working with GFX? Quite frankly, I think the future of delegation will be to bring delegates house within groups and companies that can provide them with the economic, legal, and technical advice and expertise that helps them make informed decisions.  I think it\u2019s no secret that here at Maker, we\u2019ve suffered from delegates not having access to the expertise they want. It has led to many circular arguments and reasonings around several different topics, such as the Deco Protocol proposals; I mean, that\u2019s the kind of thing where if we\u2019d had access to straightforward legal advice like this would have been a settled issue months ago. So I think there are big advantages to being inside a slightly larger organization where you can develop professional expertise in protocol governance, so I think it\u2019s just better than going alone.   Getty: One of the cool parts is we have different perspectives. My co-founder and I worked in Grapefruit Trading for the last three years, and our expertise became doing DeFi based trading and understanding protocol risk and liquidity and markets.  We are familiar with: using different apps, putting size through these apps, what all the liquidity and market side of this, all the protocols will ever participate in at least seemingly right now are all going to be finance-based. That\u2019s what everyone\u2019s background is on the team. What\u2019s awesome is whether the guy who\u2019s on phase Ph.D. candidate for Econ at a great school in the United States, and we have a great collection of opinions and views on stuff in addition to having developers solidity knowledge, straight knowledge all around, so that\u2019s the beauty of working together. We can leverage each other\u2019s knowledge because, in the grand scheme of things I\u2019ve done in governance by myself for a while, you only can get so far. If you want to scale, you got to do with people.     Joshua Pritikin: Will Maker see forum posts from Getty and Christopher, or will Christopher handle the communication side of the work? 09:04  Getty: The tentative plan right now is none of us will be posted individually on the forum, all the comms will come through the GFX labs handle, and we\u2019ll be signing with our names to like each of them. You can know that all the posts will be the opinions of the firm. PaperImperium: For those who have asked PaperImperium\u2019s handle, you should expect to see very little of that from now on. I will periodically check it for DMS for direct messages just because people notified me there. Any opinion or Opposition of GFX labs will come through the official GFX labs handle. Even if you privately messaged me about something business-related. Please, be aware that it would not necessarily be the views and opinions of GFx.   David Utrobin: For your communications on Discord, will you be on a GFX handle instead of PaperImperium moving forward? 10:16  PaperImperium: At the moment, I\u2019m PaperImperium on there as a point of contact. I generally try to avoid weighing in on it. It may be imperfect for the first week or two, but I\u2019m trying to avoid weighing in on anything that would be contentious or up for a vote. I was just there; several of us brainstormed ways to control Peg about novel ways to control going under the peg. In the future, if that ever happens\u2026 You might see me on there for chitchat, but we\u2019ll be trying very hard not to get in the weeds about anything that is for a vote or anything. So but I\u2019m available as a point of contact.   David Utrobin: Before things go to a vote, are you going to be talking from the handle about opinions and gathering feedback to inform your decision-making? 11:14  PaperImperium: Yes. You can send a message to the GFX labs handle if you prefer to communicate through the forum, but most people prefer quicker and more user-friendly. Feel free to reach out to me on Discord or whatever your preferred platform is where you can find me. Just remember that you were talking to me, that I will have my own opinions and recommendations that we internally discuss, and we\u2019ll publish our informed opinion at the end. If you have input, it\u2019s how I will solicit input. Getty: We\u2019ll try to do a good job telling people on the forum: especially the big topics, how we think on issues, and outline when we support something.  Most employment, we don\u2019t support something. I\u2019ve been on the side of putting a lot of effort into governance proposals. Don\u2019t only watch them get like shut down because a big contributor didn\u2019t voice their opinion early on. You have to go back and rework the entire thing. I know that firsthand is very frustrating. We\u2019ll do our best to try to prevent causing that pain for anyone else.     Astro: Why does the company as an entity want to be involved in governance across different protocols? Why do you expect such involvement to be profitable despite holding no crypto positions? 13:08  Getty: The world of governance is largely untapped across protocols. In the grand scheme of things being the exception MakerDAO, Governance has only existed for a year and a half for most protocols, like comp tokens. It was one of the first major ones kicking off the original DeFi. Summer. We think it\u2019s largely two. There\u2019s a lot of talent to come in. There\u2019s a lot of meaningful progress that can be made. At the same time, we are a startup trying to make money, and we will look to get compensated for the value that we provide to protocols in a meaningful fashion. We\u2019ll be transparent about that, as anyone outside of paper peering will be involved in the voting decisions. Yeah, I think we addressed that, that we make decisions on a team basis over here with a single point person for protocol.   Chat: What amount of time per week do you think PaperImperium and others will be involved? 14:30  Getty: This is Chris from a full-time gig pretty much. He does some other stuff for DeFi, but like this is, that\u2019s one of the beauties by us employing him. He gets to do this all the time. We think that\u2019s meaningful for him: being able to do that and for us to focus on governance things everywhere. So the answer is a lot of time.   Someone: Hasu and Monet Supply contributed to a piece recently about DeFi treasuries, and they picked apart makers. When Maker\u2019s revenue surpasses certain buffer limits, Dai is used to buying back and burning Maker. Hasu believes protocol should retain earnings. From a more philosophical view, what do you think about that? 14:57  Getty: I generally agree with what Hosu and Monet Supply were saying. I think in particular with Maker, though, and the argument perhaps has less weight. This should not be taken as necessarily a pro-burn lots of MKR stance. I like the burning mechanism, but to what degree and how much is always an open question. When it comes to retained earnings, the difference is that Maker is uniquely positioned amongst DeFi protocols and that if it has something that it is worthwhile to spend money on, in particular, if it\u2019s an investment, it can create Dai,  those obligations can back done, though, the one exception, I would say is if you\u2019re trying to stockpile cash to pay for personnel, which is quite expensive at Maker it\u2019s hard to mint Dai against people\u2019s time. But let\u2019s say if you see some collateral or business deal that we want to get into. Maker\u2019s main line of operations, as in the creation of guarantee of user-generated Dai, then it\u2019s the cost of capital is very low for Maker, but simply because sourcing it is so easy for most purposes. I would say I think they were spot on, but Maker is a strange bird. So for many expenses, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant.   Someone: When you say the low cost of capital. What is their cost of capital? Can they mint Dai at zero cost, or is that not correct logic? 17:19  PaperImperium: That\u2019s not correct but let\u2019s say Maker wants to diversify its reserves by holding some treasury bonds or something; let\u2019s say there\u2019s an easy way to do that. If Maker is sure that the collateral is worth Dai, then that\u2019s literally what happens every time someone deposits Eth into a vault; Maker can also do that of its account, presumably, right. That\u2019s what we do when someone trades Maker USDC or USDP, as a new Dai as minted; Maker has acquired that USDC or USDP by creating a Dai.  Now Maker, of course, has a solid commitment to always be over collateralized. Even with the safest collateral, you would still need to mint no more than the par value. But it\u2019s like I said, there are exceptions where this might make sense, like stockpiling cash to pay for personnel in a revenue drought or something like that, because we cannot easily mint Dai to pay for people. But if we see a project we want to partake in and are confident in it, then you can mint Dai against it. That\u2019s what Maker does.     Astro: What are GFX Labs going to do about conflicts of interest and the fact that we will participate in governance in a meaningful fashion of multiple protocols? 19:00  Getty: We\u2019ll state how we feel on the things we vote, and if there ever is seemingly a place where we have a conflict of interest, I think you could perceive as in the recent polls for asset off-boarding for a handful of coins, including Compound to stand on those. Having a personal opinion on there, but it didn\u2019t seem appropriate. And we\u2019re just going to keep on doing that. We\u2019ll keep on trying to be as transparent as possible. And we encourage you guys to ask us any questions about those if you ever think there is perhaps, you know, a conflict of interest anywhere will seem to be as transparent as possible, you guys.   Someone: Is the company holding MKR? 20:03  Getty: No, we don\u2019t hold any assets. I hold all the DeFi tokens because I am just spraying prey on them; I believe in DeFi. The company itself does not take positions.   Prose11: About the idea of political parties within the delegation, do you see yourself combining forces with other delegates to push for what you believe in? Do you generally have a feeling about how DAOs should address that? 20:25  Getty: Corporate Governance is a very popular thing in the corporate world that occurs everywhere, and lobbying people to get your initiatives done. It already exists in fashion; I don\u2019t believe it will not happen in DeFis law and governance; we\u2019re not all that different in reality. In my mind, it\u2019s inevitable. We certainly have seen those collaborations and other protocols. In the grand scheme of things were in all these protocols, to reach quorum or to get your proposal if passed executive and implemented, you need a substantial amount of assets to do that. We\u2019ll need to be friendly with one another. Perhaps political parties will form over time; I guess it won\u2019t be nearly as formal as the actual political system, but more like the corporate governance system.   Someone: What is the profit model if no assets are held? 21:39  Getty: There are two parts to this one. The GFX Labs has to regulate products; we have Eth lands, which is like a fun video game that we\u2019re developing, like Ostensibly Minecraft on the blockchain; you all should check out we have a playtest that\u2019s quietly running right now on elance.com.  And that\u2019s what like majority of the team is currently working on; we also have our more Boomer product for less of a term that I think would be exciting. And that\u2019s Poppy, which is like the DeFi credit card. Users can do it as people put up their Eth or any other coin, go down to Starbucks, wherever swipe it and use borrowed USDC, or whatever to pay for their assets. Essentially, like right now, everyone does this, or a lot of people do this, they\u2019ll put up assets and Maker DAO or ave a compound, withdraw USDC or something Coinbase get in their bank account, but it\u2019s just an exhausting process. In particular, the governance efforts, it\u2019s to part one, we hope to be seen as an exciting place to work that is for a formidable force in governance that does incredible things. That can help us attract talent as hiring is hard these days. And then the other part, two, is we look to get compensated for our participation, the value that we provide to protocols over time.     Someone: Do you envision that compensation to be an MKR bonus or a fixed fee or maybe a combination of both, or you have not taken an opinion on that one yet? 24:02  Getty: In the context of Maker DAO, they\u2019re going to be looking to get our feet wet. First, make sure that we can instill some good faith into the community that we\u2019re here to do some productive things. And once we\u2019ve built up some more infrastructure on our side, we\u2019re going to we\u2019ll explore a bit more about which model makes the most sense for both parties. To to be determined, I would say is the answer, but there will be something, so I\u2019ll be transparent about that. PaperImperium: Right now, Maker is unique in that it is doing a trial run of compensation to delegates which covered a lot of costs right there. To be clear, that\u2019s where the revenue for our government tactic activities that Maker is coming from now.   Someone: Are there any efforts to specifically build up a multi-disciplinary team that could cover more areas of expertise that might be required than a single person can provide? If so, which profiles are you looking to employ to provide that? 25:31  Getty: We talked about this a little bit earlier; I\u2019ll glance over it right now. The general idea is that we have a pretty collective team that will have a single protocol. Who does governance stuff on our team, that they focus on that they\u2019re an expert in that they feel like they know exceptionally well and can meaningfully contribute to. We don\u2019t want them to spray and pray to other protocols. And at the same time, we are hiring for a lot of things. For both: the products that we\u2019re building and governance stuff if you\u2019re interested in doing that. We are Chicago-based. If you are in Chicago, you\u2019d get points or willing to move there, but I won\u2019t show it working for us too much. But I would be very excited to talk to anyone who wants to.   Someone: My question was specifically about the challenge for delegates to form an opinion about different proposals or even in a single proposal that might require different areas of expertise. For example, one can be at the same time an expert in real-world assets legal structures as well as smart contract security as well as operations and finance, or governance. 26:45  Wouter: I think you answered, but my question was specifically about the challenge for delegates to form an opinion about different proposals or even in a single proposal that might require other areas of expertise. At the same time, one can be an expert in rebuilding assets, legal searchers, smart contract security, operations, and finance, for example, governance.  Getty: We have team members who are very good with the economic standpoint of this. Chris is good with the regulatory side of this stuff. And the legal side of this. I say I\u2019d be more so in the coverall or perhaps operations; we got team members who are very good with solidity and can help look at solidity things and write things as well. We don\u2019t want anyone on the team to feel they\u2019re taking a load and are trying to get in uninformed opinions. If we don\u2019t have an excellent opinion somewhere, like you\u2019re just not contributing to that or say, we don\u2019t have it on for one or try to become informed, hopefully. So that\u2019s an excellent answer to your question.   PaperImperium: Part of the advantage is having multiple wheelhouses under the same roof, so the other person in the governance section right now is a Ph.D. candidate in economics. That\u2019s helpful, and GFX will itself have access to legal counsel and other forms of maybe technical expertise. Maker has excellent technical knowledge that delegates can ask opinions, but not all delegates have access to these things. As you pointed out, that\u2019s been a pain point at Maker. And then, of course, we can also build off the fact that perhaps other folks in the governance section have seen the same challenges and other protocols; that\u2019s probably less likely and makers case, but that\u2019s another source where sometimes people have seen things before.   Someone: Some of the positions that you take need to fit in a vision. For example, the DAO market-rate compensation should not be above it; it should be below. All options could be valid depending on what the strategy is. If you want to 100 percent put everything on onboarding, you might compensate higher than when you pursue a different strategy. How do you plan to deal with developing that vision? Do you agree that that is needed to provide a consistent governance framework or delegation participation? 29:04  PaperImperium: I think it\u2019s hard to give an honest, thoughtful answer about how a vision might affect particular policy positions, right? Just because crypto is a as a whole and Maker itself, that they move so, so quickly. Perhaps we could get back to you with an answer.   Someone: Will you be giving feedback? For example, if there is a proposal that you disagree with for a specific reason you already outlined that, will you be very clear about these reasons? The more specific you get at one point, you start more or less holding the pen of the proposal. Do you think delegates should ever put forward their proposals because ultimately, your best opinion is what you write yourself? If not, what is the line exactly that is (x?)(31:07)(across) there? 30:33  PaperImperium: I think there\u2019s no obvious reason why if we see an easy value add, we would not want to propose it, but I will. You know, I, it\u2019s not necessarily my decision to make by myself.  Getty: There are a million things we would love to do. There\u2019s so much low-hanging fruit in the world of governance; right now, in participating protocols, there\u2019s a lot of optimizations that can be made but can\u2019t possibly do all of them. So to make any protocol productive requires helping people\u2019s I think we would take more of the opinion: we\u2019re going to push specific initiatives that we believe are essential in time. But mostly, if someone you know has a hard time navigating governance or gets the attention that it deserves, those are things that we believe are important to help people. And the only way we can build a constructive protocol is to make sure others have a platform to grow. I mean, everyone starts from zero at some point.      Conclusion  LongForWisdom  LongForWisdom: Are there any final shoutouts that you want to make? 33:35  Getty: If you have MKR come delegate to us, please have you that\u2019d be very nice. If you have tokens on other protocols, and you like what you hear about the general stuff that we\u2019re doing, you can do that as well. It\u2019s all going to be the same address as well. Of course, I\u2019m Maker DAO, you have an actual delegate contract, but the owner of that delegate contract is the governance handle that we\u2019re using everywhere.

Welcome to the MakerDAO Meet Your Delegate meeting #06. I am LongForWisdom. Today we have the chance to talk to our newish potential recognized delegate GFX Labs.   Christopher Cameron and Getty Hill  Presentation 01:00  1920\u00d71105 187 KB   Discussion 03:08 - LongForWisdom: Can you give us a summary of the platform? 06:18 - Astronaut: Why would I want to go from having my contract to working with GFX? 09:04 - Joshua Pritikin: Will Maker see forum posts from Getty as well as from Christopher, or will Christopher handle the communication side of the work? 10:16 - David Utrobin: For your communications on Discord, will you be on a GFX handle instead of PaperImperium moving forward? 11:14 - David Utrobin: Before things go to a vote, are you going to be talking from the handle about opinions and gathering feedback to inform your decision making? 13:08 - AstronautThis: Why does the company as an entity want to be involved in governance across different protocols? Why do you expect such involvement to be profitable despite holding no crypto positions? 14:30 - Someone (from chat): What amount of time per week do you think PaperImperium and others will be involved? 14:57 - Someone: Hasu and Monet Supply contributed to a piece recently about DeFi treasuries. When Maker\u2019s revenue surpasses certain buffer limits, Dai is used to buying back and burning MKR. Hasu believes protocol should retain earnings. From a more philosophical view, what do you think about that? 17:19 - Someone: When you say the low cost of capital, what is their cost of capital? Can they mint Dai at zero cost, or that is not correct? 19:00 - AstronautThis: What is GFX Labs going to do about conflicts of interest and the fact that we are going to participate in governance in a meaningful fashion of multiple protocols? 20:03 - Someone: Is the company holding MKR? 20:25 - Payton Rose: About the idea of political parties within the delegation, do you see yourself combining forces with other delegates to push for things that you believe in? Do you generally have a feeling about how DAOs should address that? 21:39 - Someone (from chat): What is the profit model if no assets are held? 24:02 - Someone: Do you envision that compensation to be an MKR bonus or a fixed fee or maybe a combination of both or you have not taken an opinion on that one yet? 25:31 - Someone: Are there any efforts to specifically build up a multi-disciplinary team that could cover more areas of expertise than what a single person can provide? If so, which profiles are you looking to employ to provide that? 26:45 - Someone: My question was specifically about the challenge for delegates to form an opinion about different proposals or even in a single proposal that might require different areas of expertise. For example, one can be at the same time an expert in RWA legal structures, smart contract security, and operations and finance, or governance. 29:04 - Someone: Some of the positions that you take need to fit in a vision. For example, for compensation in the DAO, the market rate should not be above it, it should be below it. All options could be valid depending on what the strategy is. If you want to put everything on talent onboarding, then you might compensate higher than when you pursue a different strategy. How do you plan to deal with developing that vision? Do you agree that you need that in order to provide a consistent governance framework or delegation participation? 30:33 - Someone: If there is a proposal that you disagree with for a specific reason, will you be very clear about these reasons? The more specific you get at one point, you start more or less holding the pen of the proposal. Do you think delegates should ever put forward their proposals because ultimately, your best opinion is what you write yourself? If not, what is the line that is crossed there? 33:35 - LongForWisdom: Are there any final shoutouts that you want to make?  Closing Comment  LongForWisdom  Outro 34:20  Thanks again, both of you. Thanks to everyone.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",

Welcome to MakerDAO\u2019s Meet Your Delegate episode #07. Today we are meeting just in case one of our hopefully newly recognized delegates.   Delegate Introduction  JustinCase 01:00  Justin Case/Delegate Platform1920\u00d71132 117 KB   Background1920\u00d71134 158 KB   Motivation1920\u00d71133 158 KB   Core Values 06:14  Core Value: Maintain Obligations1920\u00d71136 162 KB   Core Value: Growing Profits1920\u00d71135 158 KB   Core Value: Simplicity1920\u00d71129 160 KB   Working Methods 12:05  Working Method: Communication1920\u00d71131 154 KB   Questions 15:31 - Someone: One of the ongoing challenges in the DAO is figuring out how to deal with things that traditional businesses enjoy. For example, a framework to get legal advice and act on that. There is much weirdness because different CUs can get different advice, which differs from the DAO getting advice as a whole. There are other examples like HR and operations in general. Coming from your background in management, have you thought of the quirks of operations and management within a DAO versus a regular organization? 20:04 - Payton Rose: You mentioned the Surplus Buffer being burning and that being important. Do you have a mental model or a way to determine what an appropriate Surplus Buffer is? Risk might say they tend to look at a percentage of non-stable assets. Others might argue for a multiple or a fraction of projected expenses. Going forward and voting on those, is there any model you are sticking to for considering the Surplus Buffer size? 25:36 - Someone: Right now, we have the trial for delegate compensation happening. Do you have specific feelings about the way delegates should or should not be compensated, as well as to what extent? 28:02 - Payton Rose: Does your pro-burn sentiment apply to MKR as well, in terms of vesting? Would you be against the protocol minting MKR for vesting purposes? 29:29 - LongForWisdom: Before we finish, are there any shoutouts you want to do? Any links to forum accounts or Discord accounts? Anything you want to share?  Conclusion  LongForWisdom 30:27  We will get you up on the UI very soon so people can start delegating. Thank you, Justin. Thank you to everyone for joining us. I will hopefully see you all at the next meeting.

Welcome to MakerDAO\u2019s Meet Your Delegate episode #07. Today we are meeting JustinCase, one of our hopefully newly recognized delegates. To do a brief overview of how these meetings run. The delegates do a presentation, introduce themselves, and talk about their platform. The rest of the time goes to the audience to ask questions, and the delegates will answer them. This meeting is being recorded. Please, do not talk over each other. We encourage questions. Feel free to chime in.   Delegate Introduction  JustinCase 01:00  JustinCase/Delegate Platform1920\u00d71132 117 KB   Thank you very much, LongForWisdom. I am excited to be here. It is a little intimidating to give this presentation since I have been coming out of the shadows as a lurker recently. I will do the best I can.   Background1920\u00d71134 158 KB   We will start with a bit of background. One of the reasons I am going by JustinCase is because I am Norwegian. This means I have a name that I have yet to hear any English speakers have any chance of pronouncing correctly. It is also to not make my identity known, given that we are in the crypto space. If anyone wants to get my real identity, I am happy to write that on a more private channel. My background is in business management, before that military. I am probably coming at this from a slightly different angle than many people in this space. There is some value there. I have something to contribute to coming from such a background. I am also a smaller investor. I started investing way back in 2007. Then I started with crypto back in 2017. If anyone sees a pattern emerging, yes, there is. This has given me an appreciation for the risks involved. The arrows do not only go up. They also go down and sometimes dramatically. That is a valuable experience to bring into this role. We need to prepare for the bad times, even when everyone is having a party and making lots and lots of money.I am early to the party with Maker. I got my first makers way back in 2018. It has been quite a ride. It has been very interesting. There is still a long way to go for Maker.   Motivation1920\u00d71133 158 KB   Why am I doing this? It ties a little bit to get into Maker in the first place. When I started with Maker, as I am sure many other smaller investors did, we got the elevator pitch. Elevator pitch is that MakerDAO is a protocol generating revenue by lending out its stablecoins and using that revenue to burn it. I am sure everyone here is aware that there has been a discussion going around Surplus Buffer as of late. The increase in Surplus Buffer has resulted in the burn being off since way back in early June. The voices I have been hearing and reading around echo some of my sentiment that this is a little bit damaging to Maker\u2019s reputation since the elevator pitch seems such a central part of Maker\u2019s value proposition that prolonged periods of no burn are seen as a breach of contract or leads to a loss of investor confidence. I wanted to give that sort of concern of voice. I also wanted to be a part of the community and contribute in a way I have not been doing before because, as luck would have it, I have recently come into a lot more time than I am used to having. I have more possibility to contribute. Some of you may have noticed that I have been popping up around the forums, voicing some opinions, solutions, and maybe some questions. I can at least provide some perspectives in doing so. Of course, everything is down to the votes and how we all react. There is some value in putting more voices to the table. Lastly, it is communicating. Today, Maker has a little bit of a barrier to get into. Coming from a smaller investor\u2019s background and a business management background, I might be able to translate, for less lack of a better word, some of the more technical parts into something more understandable for someone who does not have 10, 15 hours per week to browse the forums and stay on top of everything.   Core Values 06:14  This leads me to three core principles or values that will guide my decision process as a delegate.   Core Value: Maintain Obligations1920\u00d71136 162 KB   The first one is maintaining obligations. This is a very important business principle, and even more in the crypto space, where one of the usual ways of enforcing contracts is absent because we are operating in a space that is not regulated so far. The weight of our word means a lot. We build trust by honoring commitments, and trust is essential for adopting and using the protocol. The very foundation of the protocol is stablecoin. If people do not believe that we will honor the one-to-one stablecoin promise, the whole protocol will fall apart. That trust can also be eroded from other things than losing the peg. It can come from perceived broken promises. Trust is a concept that is hard and gradual to build. You usually start with some base trust. Then you need to prove that trust over time and build that trust with other actors. It is a long and slow process. It takes much time to build trust, but it is a rapid process to destroy it. You do not get to make many missteps before you start to lose a lot of trust. You can see some of that in the aftermath of Black Thursday. These kinds of events, like the big events, will take a lot of trust. You can also gradually erode trust if you are not living up to the obligations you had taken on. A more recent example can be seen in the discussion going around the offboarding of the MATIC token, where you have parts of the MakerDAO who have committed to another protocol. And there is disagreement whether those commitments have been met and so forth. Even the act of bringing up a potential for offboarding them can be seen as a breach of commitments. In such a case, my base attitude would be not to offboard such a thing as long as there is an explicit or implicit obligation to be had.   Core Value: Growing Profits1920\u00d71135 158 KB   The next core value is growing profits. Growth for its own sake is good. I want to see Dai become the leading stablecoin in the crypto sphere. In order to do so, we must also maintain profit growth. The profit growth keeps Maker holders invested and aligns our interests with the Maker holders. Therefore, I will look to any proposal and see if this is helping on the path to growing profits. One way of growing profits is also cutting expenses. We are not in that particular place for MakerDAO just yet. We are still in this early startup innovation phase where it is more important to foster innovation and creativity than curb costs. I would instead focus on increasing revenue rather than reducing costs at this stage. We have a winning proposition as long as we can increase revenue more than increase the cost. That is going to be the case for quite a while yet. As an extension, the most significant potential for MakerDAO going forward is in RWF. There is tremendous potential there if we can do it right. There are pitfalls we can go into along the way.   Core Value: Simplicity1920\u00d71129 160 KB    The last one of my core values is simplicity. We are in a very innovative space. There is a lot of good ideas floating around. It is prudent to weigh complexity against what is being proposed. If I choose between a complex and a less complex solution, I will favor the less complex one. If several systems are trying to do more or less the same thing, I would want those merged into one rather than having separate systems. I would avoid too many external tokenized systems and anything that adds complexity. Every time you add complexity, you are at risk. The more complexity you add at the user end, the higher the threshold for using MakerDAO. I will favor less complex solutions if they are presented.   Those are the three core values and principles that will guide my decision-making. If anyone has checked, I have already started doing some votes and putting these things into practice to reason why I am voting the way I am voting. I am trying to refer to these principles and what has been weighing the most in that decision.    Working Methods 12:05  Working Method: Communication1920\u00d71131 154 KB    That leads me to the last part that I want to talk about, which is not a principle. This will not guide my decisions per se, but it is about my method of work, and it goes into communication.   There is something you can see an example of in my reasoning for my decisions, which is communication. We have to bridge a gap when it comes to communication. I will make it my job to make my reasoning as easily understandable as possible. I am going to try to refrain from using abbreviations. I will try to refrain from using too many technical terms if there is a simpler way to explain the discussed concepts. My goal is for anyone to go and read this reasoning and have an understanding of why this is happening. Even people from outside who are not familiar with the forums or with different technical terms can go in and get some value out of reading those reasonings.   I will try to be active on other platforms and communities, especially smaller investors, and explain Maker. I will try to drum up enthusiasm for Maker. I will try to make Maker more accessible for lesser actors. We are doing ourselves a disservice if we are putting too high of a bar in this, and if we are catering, to a large extent, to existing users, then we will hamper our growth. There is much potential in people who are not already using the platform in the crypto sphere. That is where our greatest growth potential lies. Once collaterals rise in value, existing holders will have more opportunity to mint more Dai the way the system is constructed right now. We can expect some growth there. If we want to see the kind of growth we have been having so far, we need to reach into other segments of the crypto population and try to track those, and in that, we need to have easier and more understandable methods of communication.   That was my prepared written introduction. I hope there are some nice questions that I can answer, and I hope I have some good answers for you. As I said, this is a little bit intimidating because I have been listening to a lot of very intelligent people with a very deep knowledge of all these systems speak and write their opinion. I am not coming at this from a technical background. I am coming at this from a business background. I might not be as well-versed in those particular technical details just yet. I am fortunate enough to have much time to devote to this. I can only get better as I read more.    Questions 15:31 - Seth Goldfarb  One of the ongoing challenges in the DAO is figuring out how to deal with things that traditional businesses enjoy. For example, a framework to get legal advice and act on that. There is much weirdness because different CUs can get different advice, which differs from the DAO getting advice as a whole. There are other examples like HR and even operations in general. Coming from your background in management, have you had the chance to think about the quirks of operations and management within a DAO versus a regular organization?  It is a very cool question. In MakerDAO, you have a very flat structure and several autonomous units. You have a coordination problem. As you rightly point out, you would have more of a hierarchy of this in a more traditional business. You would have more specialized units taking care of accounting, legal advice, HR. But we are trying to build a decentralized organization. Part of that is trying to live with some of these pains and figure something out. I see some good things going forward with some of the strategy meetings trying to put more coordination into the effort. That is the most important thing to sort out first. Maybe some of these support functions could be more their CUs, and other CUs could interact with, which might be a way forward. We have to figure out some way to set more followable objectives before the CUs to have more guidance on where they want to go. When it comes to legal, it is a pretty complex issue. One thing is getting legal advice, but the first question when getting legal advice is for which jurisdiction. The US will be a very important jurisdiction, but MakerDAO could potentially be embroiled in legal disputes in any jurisdiction in the world. Already there, you have some issues on how to tackle this. There is some value in having this experimental approach to the whole thing. We are working on the frontier here. This is uncharted land. If we can develop workable solutions that can satisfy legal stakeholders, we are well served by making our own rules set and presenting this to lawmakers otherwise. When it comes to legal issues, the primary concern different governments have is that they want to protect their citizens from scams and economic instability. These are the major issues that governments hold. This is getting a little bit long-winded. Let us go back to the organization. It is a challenge. I can see the challenge. We have to live with it and feel our way forward.    20:04 - Payton Rose  You mentioned the Surplus Buffer being burning and that being important. Do you have a mental model or a way to determine an appropriate Surplus Buffer? Risk might say they tend to look at a percentage of non-stable assets. Others might argue for a multiple or a fraction of projected expenses. Going forward and voting on those, is there any model you are sticking to for considering the Surplus Buffer size?  There are several claims to the Surplus Buffer, if you will. There are other competing objectives on this one. A very retailing example is that we discuss releasing the Surplus Buffer from a risk management perspective right now. We want to keep it at a certain percentage of the outstanding funds, which is a very understandable position. I have no problem with that. At the same time, we have this perception that a prolonged period of no burn is bad for our reputation, losing investors\u2019 confidence, and so on. We are also using this one for running expenses. We have Oracles coming in soon and removing a fairly substantial chunk of the Surplus Buffer. This is also a risk-mitigating measure because they need the funds to put up their risk fund to make sure they have gas to cover the Oracles costs. Risk needs to play a central role in determining an appropriate size in many ways. If Risk argues that we need a certain percentage, I will support that as a target. But there is a timing issue, and how are we getting to that target? When you put it up together, we need to compromise between these different stakeholders and their interest in what we are doing with a certain buffer. Say the Surplus Buffer, according to Risk, should be two and a half percent, and that would today mean 190 million. That is one risk. Then you have the Oracles, which need their money right now. Should we reduce the Surplus Buffer even more? We have to make a compromise between these different risks. Accept that we may be going on with a slightly higher risk than we want to, but we are working towards closing that gap. In this particular case, I would agree with Risk on the target, but I will be arguing for a more gradual response, which we have seen a discussion about already. Ideally, I would want this to be based on percentages. I know there is a technical limitation to doing that. We are forced into this, either all or nothing scenario. Some days, we are not going to burn anything. Otherwise, we are going to burn 100%. Overall, we might end up at a certain percentage. With that, we still run the risk of making that decision based on the criteria as they are right now. Assuming the bull market holds, maybe with the current data or settings, we will end up with a burn of 60%. But two weeks downline, suddenly our profits have grown by another 10 million a week. Now we are burning 70%. It is a bit unfortunate. I would rather set a percentage limit and leave it at that. You had seen the flip side of that whole thing in June when you had this compromise that we wanted to burn about a third of the profits. It worked well for a few weeks, and then suddenly, the revenue fell off a cliff. As expenses rose, the profits fell. We needed to increase the Surplus Buffer, and all these events together conspired to have a prolonged period of no burn. Let us make this concrete in the coming days because we have some actual polls on this. For the coming time, the funds needed for the Oracles have to go, which means that we will see a drop in the Surplus Buffer for the coming few days. For the coming vote, I am most likely going to vote against not increasing at this time because I would ideally want to refill the Surplus Buffer up to the 60 million that we have right now and then start racing the buffer at a gradual burning pace to make a meaningful compromise between these different objectives.    25:36 - Jerry Goldfarb  I wanted to ask you about the delegate compensation situation. Right now, we have the trial for delegate compensation happening. Do you have specific feelings about the way delegates should or should not be compensated, as well as to what extent?]  This is a question that is not well suited to be answered by a delegate. The question of delegate compensation is a conflict of interest in its very nature. In these kinds of discussions, I would prefer someone else to do the discussion and arrive at a meaningful conclusion. Even the most virtuous person can argue as well as possible, but it is impossible to do this without being biased. You are directly benefiting from whatever is being proposed. I will say this, though, delegates should hold a meaningful amount of Maker. That is part of aligning their interest with the interest of the protocol. Delegates should have skin in the game. I have skin in the game. It is not a lot, but it is around two years\u2019 worth of salary to me. It is meaningful, should that go tits up. That would be a meaningful financial loss to me, and I have incentives to make it a job in the long run. That is something that should be criteria for all delegates to align interests. Maker should be locked up for a while, as long as you serve as a delegate. And maybe a year or two after so that you are making sure that everyone is acting in good faith and acting for the good of the protocol.    28:02 - Payton Rose  Does your pro-burn sentiment apply to MKR as well, in terms of vesting? Would you be against the protocol minting MKR for vesting purposes?]  I can see where you are coming from. However, part of the Maker story is this notion that there is a million MKR minted. It is not entirely true right now, but there is some value to the optics of MKR having a set pool, and this pool is constantly shrinking. We run an additional risk by minting. To do a business parallel, a company issues and buys back stocks. In effect, minting and burning MKR are some of the same mechanisms. This whole idea of this one-round number will shrink, and it will increase the value of MKR holders. It is too valuable to mess with. My initial stance would be to not mint more Maker for vesting.    29:29 - LongForWisdom  Thank you to everyone for the questions. Thank you, Justin, for taking your time to speak to us all. Before we finish, are there any shoutouts you want to do? Any links to forum accounts or Discord accounts? Anything you want to share?  I just want to say thank you to the whole community. It is a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable community, and it is very inspiring to interact with. There are so many people so vested in the success of this project that I am really happy to have this chance to be part of it. These last few weeks, when I have been dedicated more or less full time to this, it has been extraordinary. I cannot wait to keep on doing that.   Awesome. If people want to contact you on Discord on the forum, are you JustinCase?  Yes.     Conclusion  LongForWisdom 30:27  We will get you up on the UI very soon so people can start delegating. Thank you, Justin. Thank you to everyone for joining us. I will hopefully see you all at the next meeting.

My name is Peyton: Prose11 online, and I am one of the Governance facilitators. This is a series where we meet applicants for the recognized delegate position and go over their platform, background, ask questions that hopefully make it easier for Maker holders to decide if they wish to get delegates. This call is for ACREInvest.   Delegate Introduction  Kianga 00:48  Thank you, Peyton. I am pleased to be here and excited to offer our Acre Invest platform for consideration. I would love to give a little quick presentation, and then I look forward to spending most of this time with the question and answer. I am the founder of ACRE of America, an impact investment firm. We have recently launched ACREInvest: a blockchain virtual network service provider. We are interested in new technologies and rural problems. I am speaking from Hudson, New York, in the Hudson Valley, about two hours north of New York City. Our mission is to regenerate how capital markets work and for whom. We are focused on Web3 infrastructure, tools, social incentives for DAOs governance, peer-to-peer stakeholders, looking beyond the horizon at where all these forces in our world are converging and what does a fascinating business look like from a legacy financial markets perspective? I have been in financial markets during my career; I went to law school initially and worked on Wall Street and, have been excited about what I have seen happen with Maker: what I see evolving in the space, from my earliest days as a lawyer, which was the most fun working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, and of thinking about new markets, both from the legal regulatory, but also documentation. Trading contracts and standardization of trading contracts could facilitate new product growth. Years ago, I worked on EMU in law school, like the euro\u2019s launch and the implications of making that successful, early days of credit derivatives. That collaborative work in the context of a trade association was, as I say, intellectually engaging technically. In later years, I have often thought about how much fun I had at that point in my career, and I see my role as a delegate and MakerDAO to draw on some of those experiences. We are a firm with our three general partners. Each of us has passions and particular areas, Chris Lindstrom, involved in many initiatives around the regenerative economy and local currencies. I learned so much from him about the impact and regenerative principles, and I have been thinking about how two different worlds can come together in the context of blockchain. Our other partner, Nick Feinberg, has been in the early internet infrastructure from day one and runs a data center here in the Hudson Valley. We have a lot of experience and capacity around the physical, internet, structuring of support for the stuff we are doing in the cloud. To give a little bit context about my perspective, this is how I got online, coming out of law school when I was a young professional, and this is where I worked out of cut my teeth at five Broad Street working with the commodities traders, and later on at Lehman Brothers. I was at Lehman in 2008, working with the energy business, and saw that implode from the inside. For a lot of us in this space, this is a seminal world event and moment, and the kickoff of Bitcoin, and all of our concerns about structurally, our monetary system and our financial markets and how fragile they are and sort of what would be needed to be done differently. I have spent much time where I would say the past ten years, sort of after Lehman Brothers, I took a pause from Wall Street and so tried to recover a little bit. I did much work in the art world and internet communications. I had to credit that experience helping me navigate crypto in 2017 as an outsider, just because I was familiar with memes, surfing online channels, and setting up accounts. As you are pretty nimble, from my time, my sabbatical from Wall Street in the art world, and my internet presence, as such as it is now. I like to share and talk about what is happening in the world; from a macro perspective, socially, politically, we are not so much politics. Still, politics is underlying, I think a lot of the work that we are doing, and to try to make it fun, a little bit more accessible for people, the masses, the normies, that we all want to recruit into the space. These memes around work have inspired what we are doing at ACREinvest, looking at disruptions in accessing talent, business models for companies, being a DAO, it is like turning all of these principles inside out. I am super excited about looking at the whole structure from a governance perspective, how Maker DAO can operate, and be successful, this new model, and leaning into that, and the regulatory issues and all of those things are interesting to me on top of like, the specific substance of the collateralized, stable coin, business model. Here is a diagram; spend two more minutes sharing ACREinvestment with you and what we have been working on. This is a conceptual map for a decentralized mechanism that connects technology and capital with projects in the real world\u2014and thinking very much about the hyper-local context. Coming to Hudson to establish our headquarters here, just at the beginning of the pandemic, helped me focus. I spent a lot of time outside of the virtual realm and in the real world, wanting to understand the problems with adoption for what we are working on. It felt very strongly that at that moment, as we were shutting down, the world supply chains were breaking; from a local food economy perspective, the vulnerabilities were, glaring all the wrong things, really began to be much more visible in ways that I am sure all of us on this call, have been thinking about for a long time. They began to manifest, and I felt that what I\u2019m focused on in terms of crypto and decentralized technology does not make a difference in people\u2019s lives. If people are not using it or not solving problems for business or business models, what are we even doing? So I have spent a large part of this year and last year anchoring in place. We are in a country region that\u2019s very rich in agriculture, but small and medium-sized farms. This diagram a way of thinking about pulling all these pieces together? What does it look like? How can we use non-fungible tokens to map toward real property? What is a new model for converting traditional land to regenerative agriculture? Many of these projects that will have the kind of impact that many people would love to see in the world do not have a functioning business model. Moreover, I am always talking to people about what we are doing in crypto. There are these problems like this that do not work. Have you ever thought of blockchain? Hey, nobody knows about crypto. Moreover, you are like, what is that? What is that all about? And so again, it is like guys; I cannot just keep talking about the potential; let\u2019s see if we can build a product that does all this. That has given birth to ACRE DAOs, which just literally launched a week ago, a very new portal that we built as a sort of platform or structure for a decentralized impact investment club. This month, we have an open call to invite anyone; everyone interested in these topics would like to see how virtual assets can provide a solution at the retail level, so, for the individual, but without regard to their capacity to invest. Something that can work for, you know, the inherited wealth generation next generation, like our partner, Chris, or folks who may have, you know, $1,000, at the end of the year, or even less, that is what is beautiful about the tokens and the token technology, but that this is a community for all of those folks to come together and workshop. How to make compliant investments, what the tools are, and I see, Maker DAO is so core, and have thought a lot about how the Dai currency and other mechanisms could somehow integrate with this real-world vision that we have. Just related to that, there is a secondary sort of sponsorship pool that we\u2019re also launched. Moreover, using the newest tools and Web3, this is like the juice box platform made famous by the constitution, DAO. Furthermore, I was following that with just Glee and amazement. This moment is extraordinary. I am just thrilled to have the capacity now. It aligns with our overall interests as a firm in serving decentralized communities, figuring out the governance question delivering investment products, and hopefully drawing on this community of members within acre Dows to expand our capacity. It is not just us as a firm that needs to bring all the knowledge and capabilities to bear. If we design incentives correctly and use these structures, we can incentivize and recruit people to work from their passions and do their best. We are using SourceCred as well. I have been excited to dig in on the source code trial that Maker has been experimenting with; we are also implementing that on ACREDaos. I am proud to say that one of our early founding members who joined that community has taken a genuine interest in MakerDAO, and I have been talking to that person about potentially also contributing just by learning and that they will be able to earn ACRES within the MakerDAO platform for any time that they spend on something like this. There is a massive pool of talent that this person is already working a young person working in credit on Wall Street, and in my view is like this is much more interesting, like this product, knowledge is way more exciting, and you are going to put yourself head and shoulders if you want to stay on Wall Street, you\u2019re going to have everybody there a rafter on your pinky finger, or if you ever want to leave, we\u2019re what we\u2019re doing here, obviously the future. I want to let you know, bring all that we are doing to bear personally in terms of delegation; I am the person making, doing the voting, and meeting the decisions on the I want to listen to everyone in the Maker community and others that may be able to recruit to follow along and participate. I think it is a little bit the best of both worlds. We have some of the support. Have an institution and act as an institution. There is no internal kind of \u201cLike: I am the monarch,\u201d what the actual votes will be. We will see how that may evolve. With that, I hope that was quite long. I hope that was useful. I would love to dive into any more specific questions.   Questions 16:04  In your delegate platform, you mentioned that compliance is one of your three top areas, and in the presentation just now, a lot of stuff about real-world assets and tokenization of those. Could you talk about some of your views on how you go forward with the DAO in terms of keeping compliance in mind when dealing with these real-world asset structures that perhaps the law has not exactly caught up to? And in the crypto space?  Yes, it is a vast Lee important issue, and it ties in with my other value creativity. For all of us to succeed in the world, we need to succeed. We are in a larger context of a TradFi world. Moreover, to scale, we need to think through I mean, these are my views, think through the existing regulatory framework, and how we are building will be characterized by that legacy system, either sort of factually or from a legal perspective, or even just sort of politically like right now. There are congressional hearings here in the States about stable coins. I see the issuers of stable coins as a convergence of our banking rules; banks are looking for this sort of merger that\u2019s eventually, I think, just going to happen. There is a lot that I see will happen. Creativity is about being thoughtful and nav in structuring, being very careful about our words, thinking about the framing of what we are doing in a way that has a clear path forward, potentially, or at least preserves specific arguments that align with how we want our space to be viewed. It is some of the earliest work that I did in credit derivatives, as an intern in law school, met with the Central Bank of France, with the Bank of England met with members of the Fed. The argument was that credit derivatives should be regulated because they are not insurance. They are what we know there is a trade association that\u2019s, has an army of lawyers and a staff that\u2019s writing position papers that\u2019s making a legal argument that excludes our activity from either excludes it or exempts it. This is how the derivatives industry has been so successful. When I started, it was largely unregulated. That has changed a lot since 2008. There is always an analysis. There\u2019s always an argument. I would be very engaged and involved and think about all the potential roadblocks and the sort of threats, potentially, and anticipate how we can shape and define and language our actions. That may not solve all the issues. There will be some litigation, and there will be new laws that will be cases. We need new precedents to make a new law because what\u2019s happening is unprecedented. Compliance is very much like a friend of what we all want. I know there are other views, and I think there is still such an important role for being an on is an essential role for not worrying about the rules. We have to be also careful because we are doing something different. We want it to succeed, and some things in a legacy system may be against our values or inherently like what we are trying to disrupt. That is where creativity also comes in. How do we do it? How do we avoid being too compliant or asking for permission? Cannibalizing our potential results or more. It is involved with that. That\u2019s a bit of compliance. Very important, but also a fun challenge.  20:39  I was just wondering about your background, how you felt about delegates having the ability to go up to Washington DC or travel down to Washington DC in your case? And do some lobbying work? What is your thought on lobbying? Being that you have a background? I believe you mentioned you are a member; I think it\u2019s cool. There will be what your thoughts were behind and getting the politicians down in Washington DC to precisely understand what we are doing here. What are your thoughts on that?  I was a lawyer for is, so I was an attorney and outside counsel for a trade association. I think the question of lobbying is, and I\u2019m not an expert. There are a lot of rules around that activity. I am not sure it is something I will think a lot about the terms of the delegate role. What would that mean, and whether it would be appropriate for delegates to be lobbying? I am not; my initial thought is maybe not, I think. Overall, a way that I plan to contribute to that is through my blogging, writing; I like to have to turn up the dial on this, but it is a big part of what I want to do in this role is Communicate, communicate to the little bit more of a general audience about what is happening in non-technical terms. Putting that perspective into the world can potentially help influence policymakers or be close to the policymakers. The dialogue has to occur at that level; I am not sure again, in mindful of the time, if that is the appropriate role for a delegate. Then when it address Julian\u2019s question in the chat about how Maker works, I am learning fast, and we are fast wine going to spend the holidays absorbing all of the details and nuances. Give us another couple of weeks, and then by the New Year, you will see us start to engage and participate. I think it is luckily a good time. Because I know some things are slowing down for the holidays. I think just last thing I wanted to say I mean, there were some conversations last week about sharing power, incentives, skin in the game, the different communities or stakeholders in Maker, not all of whom have sort of Maker token power, or I would love to continue to talk. I will share some thoughts in the forum about: how we can think more broadly, what skin in the game means and whether the delegates having significant Maker tokens are aligned in terms of the short term profit or value of the token, how that might potentially be unhelpful, in terms of having objective views on voting that look at the long term value or that look at the things that might benefit other people in the ecosystem that may in the short term, not be something that those who have significant holdings of the token might like. I would like to contribute to thinking about these incentives, and not so much power-sharing, but how to change some of the dynamics so that regardless of the different ways power can be leveraged in the system that\u2019s appropriate that that gives that kind of outstanding balance that Satoshi was able to figure out of not having a major party in control.  25:21  You mentioned you know how wonderfully unique Maker is and being at the forefront of both DAO and all these different types of building. From here, I wondered what your thoughts are on scaling and optimal growth strategy, our being that we do not have a ton of people to glean the information off of?  I think that the operations model is key: attracting talent. The trials around SourceCred are terrific. How can people be compensated monetarily? Most people cannot afford to spend time on something; if opportunity costs, they have to pay the rent and other things. We do not want a system where the only people who can afford to participate do not need to get paid for their time. I will highlight the source cred, which is a beautiful model where someone can just come in the register. They can potentially earn something or, if it is not recognizable, without having to be a delegate or have the capacity to do something on a large scale. I think that that model, and then maybe also the marketing, communicating, this making Maker a little sexier, translating what complex and challenging stuff I love to dive into is. The product side is just one side. Making it more accessible and exciting for people to meet fresh blood to come in and engage would be like number one.   Conclusion  Payton Rose  27:23   Thanks for sharing those thoughts. As we wrap up here, ask you further questions if people want to get in touch. What\u2019s, what\u2019s the best way to do it?  I\u2019m in Discord, ACREinvest#2401, and obviously, the forum. Those would be the best two ways. I\u2019m also on Twitter a lot. Personally, my primary social tools, really Twitter at KDerrington. I also post on Instagram; I have a blog. If you saw the earlier slides but, in terms of the delicate work, the Discord and the forum would keep everything very consolidated, and I won\u2019t miss your messages there.  Prose11: Certainly. Thank you so much for doing this meeting to let us know a little bit of value for people on the call. By the time your next meetings are over, you should see the ACREinvest possibility to delegate on the voting platform for MakerDAO.com. If you\u2019re watching on YouTube, it should already be up. Thank you so much for this, and I look forward to engaging and participating with you in the community.

This is up to the fifth Meet Your Delegate meeting. My name is Peyton; I go by Prose11. I\u2019m one of the governance facilitators. I\u2019ve got the honor of hosting Tim Schupbner, who goes by Schuppi or UltraSchuppi, depending on the Maker platform. The structure is pretty simple after the recording. We give our delegates five to 10 minutes to let them know about themselves and their platform and share any slides they want to present. The rest of the session will be Q&A. We do cap these at 30 minutes to try to be respectful to all delegates. Whether you joined earlier or later on in the process, keep it as standardized as possible. If you have questions, feel free to chime in, or you can drop them in the sidebar; I\u2019ll be watching the chat. We\u2019ll be incorporating things as appropriate; this is being recorded, so be aware of that. We\u2019ll be going on YouTube later. Please try not to speak over each other and mute yourself when you\u2019re not talking just to cut down on background noise. Without further ado, I\u2019ll pass it over to you.   Tim Schuppi 01:40  Welcome to the My Media delegates session. My name is Tim Schupner. I\u2019m 40 years old, married, and have three boys at home, age 10, seven, and five. I\u2019m a German citizen, and I\u2019m living pretty close to the border to France in the southwest. My professional background is in computer science. I have been working in software engineering for more than 20 years now. I\u2019m currently serving as a senior engineering manager. Right now did a bit of my background and my relationship with Maker. So I got in Ethereum in 2017. By the time, we hadn\u2019t too many projects running on Etherium. I quickly found Maker and found the product very interesting. I opened up a ward or CP at the beginning of 2018, minded some Dai leveraged on ETH. I also bought my first MKR token and participated and liquidated through this friendly UI we had by the time. Then I started lurking in RocketChat and the forum for about a year. I think I signed late because if you\u2019re just reading, you don\u2019t need anything there. Around that time, I felt that having MKR tokens as an investment and something that I should use. I put my MKR into the voting contract. I participated in every poll, and the executive burnt roughly five ETH already, which is pretty tiring to know. I realized that Aaron was making signal requests in the forum to deal with the parameters of the Maker protocol. He stopped doing his work. It\u2019s not working because it\u2019s not paid. It\u2019s the classic from user to contributor story. I picked up this work, and I was bombarding the forum for a couple of months with signal requests. I was dealing with debt ceilings, stability fees, not stability speeds because we already had the rates by the time but basically, many parameters needed to be set. That was also why I joined the rates group at the beginning of 2021, which became the Maker Open Market Committee. I\u2019m still a member of, and I enjoy working there. At the beginning of this year, I also had some time in the autonomous MakerDAO working group, which consisted of people not on the foundation\u2019s payroll or any existing CoreUnits, but interested in growing the DAO. By the time I collaborated with Seb, I was on the idea of creating the EuroDai. A Dai currency pegged to the euro and tried to push Core Units to deal with it. So basically bootstrapping, I think, almost a month ago. Being a delegate has always been something I wanted to do. Two years ago, we had a guy called The Drunk Whale in RocketChat. I poked him regarding support to the executive, mentioning we\u2019ve been waiting for two weeks already. In the end, he sold all his MKR tokens. That\u2019s not the first victim I would have for delegation. When I decided it would be a part of it, I ditched it for the Maker labs Core Unit. But now that it is over, I can do what I wanted to do in the first place. I think delegation is a great thing, and we are so much better now in terms of being able to do executives and bundle under voting power in the end because voter apathy is still striking me. From my point of view, voting is not optional. If you buy MKR, you need to participate there, or you delegate. As Planet X is out, we don\u2019t have any delegates outside of the S. My background is different compared to other delegates: I don\u2019t have a real background in finance despite working in the Maker Market Committee. I think I can bring some non-US aspects into the voting or the delegation crew. Looking at stuff from a technical perspective may help as well. How am I generating my opinions? I spend my time on the forum, most of the time passively, ingesting what I see there, and I observe intelligent people there. We lack expertise in certain areas; the decor MIP that we did not pass in the last cycle is a good example of where we need experts. But certainly, I think delegates do not have to be an expert, and you certainly cannot cover all the relevant aspects, but you need experts that you can consult. I think delegation should not contain lobbying or some kind of outside representation. In some cases, you probably cannot avoid that, but I would rather have a lobbying Core Unit for dealing with some stuff that we probably need to do. I propose myself as a recognized delegate because I have been doing it for more than two years. Probably not all of you have seen my posts on the forum. Instead of having a nice write-down of the core values and stuff like this, it\u2019s putting my hot bullet for voting. You can see that I have participated constantly in all the polls in executors for the last two years. What\u2019s changing for me is that I need to be more transparent about why I vote for or against a proposal. But the added effort is writing that down and probably being more open to communicating with people who may have questions or concerns. I\u2019m not happy with how I think, which is not that much work because I\u2019m already spending time with the protocol. That also means that I\u2019m going to vote anyway, so this is not a warning. I will not change my voting behavior just because somebody is delegating a lot of MKR to me. I\u2019m not doing that for some kind of money that might eventually pop up for recognized delegates. I also don\u2019t fear that this will be a full-time job because I already have a full-time job. If it turns out that it evolves in this direction, that\u2019s fine. So far, I\u2019m happy if this does not work out and if nobody\u2019s delegating to me. I won\u2019t feel like I failed.  Prose11: Right on time, thank you. Appreciate the platform presentation. As I mentioned earlier, this will move us to the Q&A section. Anyone who\u2019s attending is welcome to ask questions. I\u2019ve got a list of general questions we prepared to ask the delegates; there shouldn\u2019t be any silence, so I want to hear from the people attending here if possible as I haven\u2019t seen anything pop up in the sidebar. So if I don\u2019t see anyone on mute in a moment, I will fire off the first question. Remember, yours is probably a better question than mine.   Schuppi: 10:56 It would be nice to see your list first. There should be some kind of surprise in yous, right?   Questions 11:02  Q1: No surprises. Sorry about that. We had it a little more organized on the RocketChat. I realized we don\u2019t have the delegates extension anymore at Discord. One of the questions is about delegate compensation. What are your thoughts about how delegates should be compensated? Does that affect how you\u2019ll be acting as a delegate going forward?  Schuppi: The main point about delegates\u2019 compensation is that we should avoid this looking like the kleptocracy. Before this goes unchained, we should have discussions, and probably even people from the outside saying how this is dealt with in comparable situations. It would look strange to me to push something unchained as a poll, where delegates could already vote on their salary. I understand that from a different angle we need some compensation for people who spend a lot of time there. I think it\u2019s hard to make a good plan, but it needs to be well prepared before it goes unchained. It feels weird to decide on my salary. I think we need something to check people, experts, for example, and we need them, but maybe we just need experts in Core Units that act as working groups proposing or evaluating. The same goes for collateral onboarding. I just looked at the two collaterals that are on the pause right now. I just have feelings, and this is not good and not working. You cannot avoid that you have a gut feeling on a certain topic. But it\u2019s better if you have some facts on it, and I cannot provide them.  Prose11: Thanks for that insight. Still no questions.    13:37  Q2: I like the reflection in your delegate platform of kind of growth over profits. I was wondering if you wanted to talk about that and share your vision for MakerDAO. What is MakerDAO supposed to do? How does that vision of growth over profits fit into that?  Schuppi: It\u2019s not really that I have a vision for Maker as a product. I think that we are just in a growth stage. We are far away from harvesting; I would say we are still at the very beginning of the hopefully of your hockey stick. Before the meeting, I was working on a new Signal request for increasing this surplus buffer again. I realized that it doesn\u2019t matter if we burn MKR or just accumulate a surplus and the surplus buffer from a value perspective and our wholeness. It is important from a PR perspective. Instead, I would pile up cash that we could spend on new Core Units or some crazy ideas, even on experiments, rather than going into harvesting mode early. That\u2019s the reasoning behind that.  15:32  Q3: Do you anticipate not wanting to be delegated more than an X amount of MKR? For example? Some people don\u2019t want more than 10 or 20 MKR. It\u2019s a big responsibility. Do you have a certain number that you ideally would like delegated to us recognize the delegate?  Schuppi: It\u2019s getting scary, and at some point, you need to think about how you protect against bribes or against people kidnapping your kids to get something done? I\u2019m not expecting this to happen anywhere, to be honest. It would probably be a good idea to think about this before going into panic mode once this happens. I\u2019m currently not expecting this. I didn\u2019t; it\u2019s probably not even doable. I mean, the delegation contract we have right now does not have a capping mechanism. I guess.  David Utrobin: My understanding is there\u2019s no cap mechanism. Not yet.   Schuppi: I\u2019m going to think about this, but I don\u2019t have a clear answer to that.  16:52  Q4: Have you looked at what it costs voting on polls in the past and executive in terms of fees? This isn\u2019t getting cheaper. Why should everybody who\u2019s not doing anything get a free ride while the people who work a lot get nothing? Yeah, I\u2019ve worked in a lot of. I\u2019ve also donated my time, and co-ops, and intentional communities. A theme in all of these communities is a lot of people, or I should say, a fair number of people doing 90% of the work, while the other 70% does nothing. I think that\u2019s unfair, so compensation based on action is reasonable. I want to encourage you to think about that, and if you want hard questions, I will have to leave; I\u2019ll probably have to listen to this later. Here\u2019s a couple, the PSM 10, TNT out going to zero. I want to hear what your views are on that. What\u2019s going on with Feb, and how was that approached? We didn\u2019t even have a poll on this, and there was a MIP thrown up that we didn\u2019t even get a chance to discuss. Before a MIP was thrown out, I think that was very fast, very hard.  Schuppi: I have been hearing stuff from different delegates of people delegating their Maker kind of levering in on, in the sense that we want to vote as delegates. The way we see fit for the protocol. If we don\u2019t have a material stake, maybe it\u2019s the case that these people who have the Maker have a correct view, and perhaps I should go along with them, but if I do that, why don\u2019t they just vote their Maker themselves? So I have a real heart issue. One of my biggest problems with delegates and political systems is a conflict of interest in voting. I was not just bribing somebody but controlling them with a vote because this isn\u2019t a democratic system. It\u2019s one Maker one vote system, and if you have 50,000 Maker, you get 50,000 votes, and that is not democracy. I think there\u2019s a lot of issues here to work out. That creates a lot of hazards. I\u2019ll listen to this later because I have a deficient phone battery left. I eagerly anticipate hearing your answers on some of these. Let\u2019s start with compensation. There needs to be compensation. My incentive for doing this is because I\u2019m over-invested in MKR. It\u2019s unreasonable how much I have acquired compared to my net worth; it\u2019s probably not comparable to other people. Compared to what I think is reasonable, it\u2019s a way of being good. My main incentive is I want to participate here to make the protocol better. To have this as a good running investment. The gas fees that I have to pay for participating in Governance are covered by this whole square payout scheme I get right now. This is not a good way of thinking; I get power, of course, like money. For me, it feels like participating in an open-source project but with skin in the game. Right now, that\u2019s okay for me if I would need to quit my job for doing that. It\u2019s not so quickly, the PSM thing. Did I vote in favor of the PSM thing? I\u2019m not 1% sure if that\u2019s the right decision, but I think it helps the growth of teams to underline that we have a heart pack, essentially, to the USDC. Or to USD. I think it\u2019s worth the effort of trying that if we find out it\u2019s not working and I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to come up with a doomsday scenario. If we find out that it\u2019s not working, then we can sketch out a plan of how to get rid of that again, as well. So what\u2019s the next step? I mean, I think it\u2019s in the platform statement; I already said something about I\u2019m trusting my and people that I trust and KPIs, and it\u2019s probably wrong. Probably many people already know that I already work for SAP quite frequently. In the end, the Maker\u2019s Mark committee, also Euro Dai. So I trust SAP. I hate this drama aspect, but I agree with Rune that we cannot avoid drama in this situation because we are in the worst of both scenarios being not a democracy, but also not we don\u2019t want to have stuff closed doors that transparent and open. Could this have been handled better? Of course. Right now, I would not vote in favor of the offboarding proposal because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a major flaw in the system we have right now or WhatsApp has been working on. I think it\u2019s good training for us as a DAO to go through that. The only downside we have right now that is hurting precisely one person, which is sad. That\u2019s a bad situation. It would have happened a couple of months later. Anyway, I have seen this coming to be honest. Since summer, we have had some friction in the river finance area, maybe even earlier, so this is not new. I mean, Sebastian was already saying something like, if you want to remove me, please just propose this sub proposal; I didn\u2019t know two months ago at the Governance and Risk meeting. It\u2019s not surprising but disappointing. I mean, it\u2019s not going to happen before January. I guess there will be some kind of discussion before that, and maybe some effects. It\u2019s good that we don\u2019t need to vote on that today. I would say\u2014private entanglement. Again, I\u2019m not an expert on that. I have no idea if this qualifies as a private entanglement on it. Not, I can just say I still have trust. John, it hasn\u2019t changed because of this offboarding proposal. If I need to vote today, I will not support the offboarding proposal. Did I cover all the questions from MakerMan?  Prose11: Those are the three. Schuppi: We are already in a fatal situation there. So the only downside from my point of view of going to zero on the tin is that we are missing out on fees. But if UCC is losing the peck, we will get a lot of UCC onto our balance sheets. That\u2019s going to happen anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter if we have a point or 10 bits or zero bits; that doesn\u2019t make a difference. From my point of view, I\u2019m not expecting a lot of change there because right now, we see a lot of offboarding from the PSS and not onboarding. So I don\u2019t expect there\u2019s a lot of change there at this point.    24:29  Q5: It might be interesting to hear your thoughts about the challenges between bringing on Core Units and potentially off-boarding them. How do we, as a DAO, with this new structure? Now we\u2019ve got delegates, another player of power in the system. I\u2019m curious if you have thoughts in the system on how our process can be improved?  Schuppi: I made my own experiences with a EuroDai fish Maker lapse thing, so I\u2019m biased. I\u2019m not willing to share a lot of details on that. I have to admit I\u2019m still digesting that. We have great mechanisms, and I think it\u2019s great that we have some tools for incubating teams, which is essentially part of the function of SES. When you look at my MIPS 39 thing for Maker labs, there were a couple of things in the comment section that made me think, are we doing this right? Is this SCS the only way of doing incubation? Probably this right now. Is that correct? Is that the proper approach? Maybe it is for now, but is it in the long run? There was stuff like maybe make a left should be done within the growth coordinate? Shouldn\u2019t we have the goal of having multiple growth Core Units in the end? And is something like prototyping stuff part of that? It\u2019s not related to me as being a delegate. It was an interesting ride to learn about aspects of how we deal with this. So far, we\u2019ve been pretty good at onboarding new Core Units. I wouldn\u2019t have expected so many by the time the foundation decided to shut down.  Prose11: At the beginning of the year, when we had this autonomous MakerDAO working group, Amy told us that the foundation wanted to shut down in a couple of months. Schuppi: What\u2019s going to happen? All the teams from the foundation are going to transition over, which is essentially happening. So let\u2019s deal with it. That\u2019s the way it goes. And it\u2019s okay. There\u2019s talent and people that already know how the system is working. I mentioned not sure if we are good enough for onboarding external talent as well. I don\u2019t have data, to be honest. But this is stuff I\u2019m thinking about for sure. Prose11: Perfect reflection, thanks. Mark, do you want me to get to you? We are coming up at the end of time here. So let\u2019s have Mark ask his question, and then we might be wrapping up after that.    28:14  Q6: I just wanted to circle back real quick on the process related to offboarding facilitators. In this situation, we should have some sort of process and structure. In the US, that will employ the generally like, as a business matures, the leadership gets more experience. Formal plans lead to someone being fired; you just don\u2019t fire someone out of the blue with no notice. It\u2019s just not a good way to run a business. It\u2019s not a good way to build the company culture. You want to give someone a chance if they\u2019re not doing something or you\u2019re not performing up to the standards to make amends and get to the standards. Businesses call them performance improvement plans. I don\u2019t see why as a DAO, we couldn\u2019t implement something similar and avoid drama. It\u2019s unproductive and distracting from the overall mission of the DAO. I want to get your thoughts on that.  Schuppi: I agree. Again, humankind has no history of running DAO, so we are pioneers here. And, of course, stuff like this is supposed to happen. We should be more professional in that. I\u2019m not sure how this will evolve. In the concrete case of Sebastiaan. Definitely, but in the long run, this is a great opportunity to learn from that. How could we do that better? I think we should have something in place. To be honest, we also don\u2019t have anything that finds out that Core Units is adding value to the same amount they get funding. This is also something where we lag. We know how much money we put into each Core Unit but do we know how is this spent? Or what some call units are transparent on that some are not. It\u2019s not a primary problem. We are in the lucky situation of needing to spend a lot of money anyway, or we should do that. Is there a certain efficient way in the long run? No, for sure, and we better prepare for that before it\u2019s a big mess. The same applies to having a plan for people who are probably not delivering the same way as expected, and we were backed out. We should be better at that, for sure.  Someone: Thanks. I think that makes sense, and I think you see some of that feedback. Some of the Core Unit budget proposals for people renewing their budgets, you saw that, like content productions, that, for example, where I think there\u2019s a mismatch of expectations between some delegates and holders. That\u2019s one major issue I see is, you know, sometimes there\u2019s a gap and what the DAO or delegates expect relative to what the Core Units are doing. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t even show up in the Core Unit threads themselves until this budget comes up for a vote. Quickly, people can find themselves without funding without being a job. You could say that the onus is strictly on the Core Unit facilitator to maintain the delegates relationship but, I feel that\u2019s an area that needs improvement.   Schuppi: I think it should be taken off the responsibility for Core Unit facilities. This needs to be standardized among all the Core Units anyway, from my point of view. It\u2019s not that you get a carte blanche for whatever you want to do with the money you get; there should be some kind of metric or standardized system on how you deal with it. However you call it, OKS, whatever, there\u2019s so many tools put in there. But they need needs to be something for sure.  Unknown Speaker: I\u2019ll have a post that\u2019s relative to that subject coming shortly.   Schuppi: Looking forward to it; I enjoyed the session last week with you about strategy reviews as well.  Unknown Speaker: I appreciate that. It\u2019s 100%\u2014the same subject. So keep an eye open. Prose11: It\u2019s always exciting to see working collaboration take place on the calls well. Appreciate you doing this for a stem. Take a look at Tim\u2019s delegate platform on the voting contract; I will be merging his GitHub pull requests that contain his platform and all that other fun stuff. You will probably be able to delegate him if you\u2019re watching this back to the lobby live and for the was here with us now. Just wait a little bit. Thanks, everyone, for coming. And I do encourage us to continue the conversations in the forums. Take a look at Tim\u2019s delegate platform and engage there further.   Schuppi: Please reach out wherever you want to forum discord, even this funky email address I have. So I\u2019m really happy if we can have some follow-up conversations here. Even if you\u2019re not interested in delegating to me, it\u2019s always nice to talk to people with different opinions.

Welcome to the MakerDAO Meet Your Delegate meeting #05. My name is Payton Rose. I am one of the governance facilitators. Today I have got the honor of hosting Tim Schuppener.   Delegate  Presentation 01:40  Discussion 11:14 - Payton Rose: Do you have feelings about how delegates should be compensated? Does it affect how you will be acting as a delegate going forward? 13:36 - Payton Rose: What is the reflection in your delegate platform of growth over profits? Can you talk about that and maybe mix in your greater vision for MakerDAO? 15:32 - David Utrobin: Do you anticipate not wanting to be delegated more than x amount of MKR, for example? Do you have a certain number of MKR that you would like delegated to you as a recognized delegate   16:51 - Makerman: I heard you on delegate compensation. Why should everybody who is not doing anything get a free ride while people doing a lot of work get nothing? That is unfair. Compensation based on action is reasonable. What are your views on the PSM 10, TNT out going to zero? What is going on with Seb? What are your thoughts on how that was approached? Also, one of my biggest problems with delegates and political systems is the conflict of interest in voting. Can you talk about this? 25:16 - Payton Rose: Can we hear your thoughts about the challenges between bringing on CUs and off-boarding them? We, as a DAO, with this new structure, have got delegates, another player of power in the system. Do you know how our process can be improved? 28:11 - Mark: I wanted to circle back on the process as it relates to off-boarding facilitators. We should have some process and structure. As the business matures and the leadership becomes more experienced, there are formal plans for someone to get fired. We could implement something similar to what businesses call performance improvement plans and avoid drama. I would like to hear your thoughts on that. 33:41 - Payton Rose: Where can people contact you?  Closing Comment  Payton Rose  Outro 32:53  I appreciate you doing this for us, Tim. Take a look at Tim\u2019s delegate platform on the voting contract. We will be merging his GitHub pull request that contains his platform and other fun stuff. Thanks to everyone for coming. I encourage us to continue the conversations in the forums. Take a look at Tim\u2019s delegate platform and engage there further.
