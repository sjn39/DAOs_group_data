Time TBA (but most likely from 2pm till 6pm Osaka time with group dinner afterward) In the meantime, we are trying to get to know what topics you guys are interested in to talk about during Council. Please comment on this post which topic you would like to bring up  Update (9/25)  Schedule, Magicians in Osaka Activities and more. Due to not enough feedback, we decided to not have any official space and Council on Monday (Oct 7th). It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t form a ring and have a ring meeting - of course, you can, feel free to create a new wiki post and self-organize this meeting.

Could Kialo help improve the quality of contentious conversations? Signaling Ring       Hey everyone! I presented Kialo at the DGOV node at Web3 Summit. Kialo describes itself as a \"platform for rational debate.\"  I\u2019ve had some conversations with the team that created this tool, and it is pretty clear that they have put in a lot of work - it seems to be pretty far ahead of many of the debate mapping/tracking tools I have tested over the last few months.  A few notes from my conversations with the team over there and my experience playing with it thus far:    One of the cool things \u2026     ",
