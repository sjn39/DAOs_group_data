                    "content": "As outlined in the Credit Agreement, 6s Capital Partners LLC (\u201c6sCP\u201d) must complete an audit of its financial statements after each calendar year and deliver the results to the Trustee.  Why is it required in the Credit Agreement? As 6sCP is a financial ratio driven operating business, oversight on the amount of equity in the business is an essential component. The more equity the company has, the more credit 6s has access to (constrained by the debt ceiling). Thus the audit is the ultimate \u201coracle\u201d for real-world assets. Including the audit in the Credit Agreement was not a requirement demanded by the MakerDAO community. 6s, foreseeing this would be appropriate, needed, and customary, volunteered to have this added as a compliance and safeguard to protect all parties. As anyone in financial services that has been in or around a GAAP audit knows, completing the audit and then receiving a clean opinion is an accomplishment and not issued easily. This audit is the independent certification that the numbers in the financial statements have been reviewed and inspected. Further for operating businesses that are in the non-bank lending space, auditors inspect originated loans (closing statements, line-by-line, etc) to ensure that they are compliant with applicable documents. (This last part is >> essential << for the DAO). A U.S. GAAP financial statement audit is a milestone and from our lens should be a required component for all RWA DAO participants. If the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that all publicly traded companies file annual reports with GAAP audited financial statements, so should the DAO. The DAO should leverage external service providers to scale (including auditing services and intentionally avoid the private entanglement of trying to accomplish the same with a core unit). To that end, 6s is happy to announce that the 6s Capital Partners LLC - 2021 financial statement audit was completed by Watkins Uiberall, PLLC. Further, it was issued \u201cclean\u201d and has been shared with RWA Company LLC and WSFS.
