                    "content": "It was brought to GovAlpha\u2019s attention earlier today that the wording of a Governance Poll posted yesterday was potentially misleading. The Governance Poll in question asked MKR holders whether or not they approved a proposal from the Strategic Finance CU for a tactical re-allocation of budgets. The initial copy could have been misunderstood to suggest that any changes as a result of this process could have entered directly to an Executive Vote, which was not the case. This has now been clarified in the poll copy by this Pull Request. The Outcomes section of the vote now appears as follows on the voting portal:  image921\u00d7289 17 KB  We felt this means of clarification appropriate as not much MKR had voted so far, and stopping the poll and delaying it until next week seemed counter-productive in this instance. GovAlpha apologises for any inconvenience or confusion that this may have caused. Please get in touch with us if you have any questions. I have reached out to the Recognized Delegates who already voted on this poll. cc: @strat-fin-core-unit @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates ",

This is already happening, except without any structure or transparency, as delegate conversations and performance assessment discussions are currently being held behind doors, if at all.

We agreed that the devil is in the details, and @monkey.irish pointed out that KPIs can be a major productivity drain and we have to be very cautious in implementing these, while @pipko pointed out that the first generation of KPIs we develop is unlikely to be the silver bullet we look for. And second, I find the proposal gives too much discretion to both SF and delegates, mainly in an off-chain process to arrive at KPIs. I\u2019d love to see something much simpler and more decentralized. CUs take the KPIs they already have, SF helps them tie that to overarching DAO goals like break-even profitability, and CUs publish these KPIs with their budget proposals. Delegates can then individually vote on that. I know this is not the kind of \u201cefficient decision making\u201d which we all probably know from traditional orgs, but this is not such an organization. We need to make very sure we do not create the impression of centralized control. I also do not want to have power concentrated in advisory CUs or delegate councils. Delegates can and do talk amongst each other, and this helps to expedite decision-making. I think CUs already have high-level, measurable goals they strive to attain. SF should work with CUs on a one-on-one basis to gather these metrics, help CUs understand how budget constraints can affect them, and then help them present these to voters during budget proposals. SF could be a kind of information hub and DAO accounting powerhouse. ",

I think anybody from this DAO should be able to participate and make recommendations, and in fact help develop Key Performance Questions, before KPIs are set in stone. What do I mean by Key Performance Questions? Well, as an example (humor me for a second) someone in the working group can ask the Question:  How many new devs does the DAO need to onboard by Q4 2022, and why does it need new devs onboarded by Q4 2022?  Which in turn is measured by a KPI such as, \u201cDevs to be hire in 2022\u201d and why devs need to be hire by Q4 2022. The DAO needs to figure out what Questions it needs to have an Answer to in order to understand how well a CU is performing and executing a strategy. Sometimes in life it\u2019s better to ask a Question than to have all the answers. I believe it was Google who once said that they run their operations by asking Questions, rather than having answers. Hence, I don\u2019t believe this Poll is asking any of the participants to centralize KPIs. A good example of how KPQs can be designed via a Decentralized interactive workshop working group, is what @0xdeniz & @Davidutro did with a Figma Tool:  image1538\u00d7884 84.8 KB  This  workshop ask Questions first, and then it tried to define what Performance thinking related steps need to be taken in order to measure good performance. Once the working group composed of many participants has identified the questions that need to be answered\u2013then evaluating all existing data will lead to the right KPIs. And yes it sounds easy, and its not. But as I always believe, we won\u2019t know until we try.     rspa:  I also do not want to have power concentrated in advisory CUs or delegate councils. Delegates can and do talk amongst each other, and this helps to expedite decision-making.   The problem with not having delegates involved is that when it comes to voting on KPI parameters most won\u2019t understand what Strategy, Questions, and Answers were used to define a certain CU KPI. Therefore, each Delegate Platform will be guessing based on their own unique belief\u2013versus putting in the work and getting their hands dirty, aka, participating in a working group. Believe me when I tell you that since inception, I and other Delegates have played a guessing game, or an opinionated game, because we had no idea what Strategy, Questions, and Answers were being asked.     rspa:  I think CUs already have high-level, measurable goals they strive to attain.   While I agree with you that most CUs have goals that they aspire to attain, the problem is MKR token owners won\u2019t know and won\u2019t understand what those goals are without identifiable KPIs. Unfortunately that\u2019s just human nature. Show me the money.  ",

Let\u2019s say it ends up at 0M. Well that would be a good time to analyze why I didn\u2019t. Because I didn\u2019t worked, wasn\u2019t pushy enough, bad luck? Doesn\u2019t need you punish the CU directly but at least you have a discussion and try to improve what can be improved. If I have such an 500M target and no one complained, it should at least avoid that, down the line, delegates are all having concerns, those KPI could be bring up. The KPIs would go both ways to me. A tool for discourse. Key point, being a tool. Community already spent too much time overthinking that. ",

CUs are free to develop their KPIs on their own before presenting to the community or can ask SFCU for assistance. SFCU\u2019s role will be to collect and aggregate the initial and updated budget and KPI information from the forums and present this information back to MKR holders to inform their competing capital allocation plans.

Much like the recent delegate MIP set, there could be a prolonged RFC term where the various stakeholders work together.

What is the ambition: Scale DAI supply by 3B in the next 12-months. Target Market: RWA Portfolio Managers that have at least 5-years experience and that provide first loss-capital and assures MakerDAO as Senior Secured.

Core Competencies: Decentralized lending platform that allows Arrangers to develop and produce a unique product (DAI) offering to the Real World. Finance Objectives: produce Stability Fees of 120M DAI per annum. The Surplus Buffer incurs 120M DAI minus RWF CU expenses then the DAO makes a profit of ______. Competition and Risk: What is market competition doing that MakerDAO does not do well, and what are the operations and financial risks to the DAO.

What is the time horizon to onboard an Arranger, and is it possible to speed up the process? How can the DAO communicate to the world that DAI is an innovative tool for onboarding RWAs? To what extend can MakerDAO offer lower rates than its competition, and how will MakerDAO outperform other Platforms vying for RWA collateral Types? How will this indicator be used? Will it be used to measure success of the CU or just to measure growth of this type of asset class?   Name & Assign the Indicator  Gather available & supporting metrics or data that you need in order to answer the questions above. Make sure the data collection is completely aligned with the  strategy and it can help fully answer the questions above. Every KPI needs a name so that the participants can discuss it collectively.  Indictors are not targets. The DAO should use benchmarks. Example: in Q3 2022 500M of RWAs will be onboarded. In Q4 of 2002, the benchmark will be 1.2B, etc. (define thresholds) Collect KPI date on a monthly basis, therefore MKR owners can track trends via the SES KPI Dashboard Assigned responsible key stakeholders that will monitor & feed the data into the SES KPI dashboard (hopefully this can be automated) Assign an expiry/revision date for indicators. Seasons change, people change. Assess 12-months later if the indicator is worth using.  ",
