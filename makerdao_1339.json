If you are a MKR holder and not completely self-destructive then I think you will agree everyone taking a second to stop and think would be a good idea. I am going to go hide and work on a very rigorously constructed incentive-compatible collateral onboarding and collateral pricing mechanism. At this point you can be sure I am not going to be deploying anything with even one unresolved design problem, there are simply way too many highly motivated individuals with zillions of dollars looking at all my shit in particular for me to expect to be able to make anything with even one flaw and have it not come get completely broken. The problem once again is not that I think someone borrowed MKR to engage in the collateral onboarding mechanism but that I think simple majority voting is a bad fucking mechanism, period. If you break the only reason to act rationally as an MKR holder which is proportional risk offset with fucking buy/burn and then having simple majority voting, you are absolutely inviting to get completely cleaned out. If I was a multi-billionaire I would be eyeing this and running the numbers on how easy it is to plunder the whole system too. To me it seems obvious these borrowers were planning to voot themselves some new collaterals, which is fine, if we had a reason to suspect the collateral onboarding mechanism would select sound collateral types, but since it is fucking simple majority voting, there is absolutely no reason to think that would be the case. I think that actually, it is likely a lot of that collateral would have been complete garbage. Here is what I think Maker should do. You guys should plan to think just a little bit about how to use the MKR token itself, or, some kind of other external backstop, or perhaps even a combination of both, and maybe use some prediction markets to help with decision making. You guys should plan to have an approximation to a sound collateral onboarding mechanism. You can still voot to change things if you think there might be a better way. But you need to start by experimenting with \u201cskin in the game\u201d solutions and not things that are going to get obviously targeted by smarter-is-stupider funds who cannot do a single fucking thing and repeatedly just lose money over and over. If you need help with specifics, you all have guys in my chat by now, so just fucking ask in good faith and we can share some ideas. ",
