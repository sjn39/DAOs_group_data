After The Merge, we will have a 5 week period from Sept 23 to Oct 27 without any AllCoreDevs or Consensus Layer calls. Despite not having formal weekly check-ins, it would be good to keep making progress on planning the Shanghai network upgrade. Here is a proposal for how to organize this in a more asynchronous way.   EIP Champions use the shanghai-candidate topic to signal they\u2019d like to be considered for the upgrade. Either by creating a new discussion thread, like this, or adding the label to an existing discussion-to link, like this. This will allow people to quickly see which EIPs want to be proposed. Notify anyone who has signalled on Github that they want their EIP considered to add this tag.   During this period, client teams, researchers and EIP champions are encouraged to use the tagged Ethereum Magicians thread as the main place to discuss the technical details of proposals.   For EIPs which require more synchronous discussions, organize breakout rooms which are advertised on the EIP\u2019s EthMagicians thread, ethereum/pm and the R&D discord.   On Thursdays 14:00 UTC, have optional #party-lounge sessions in the R&D discord to discuss EIPs, general planning, etc. Unlike ACD/CL calls, there is no expectation that all client teams would be present or that the scope of the upgrade would be decided in these, but they should be useful for general context sharing.   It is worth noting that the goal of this month is to move forward the technical specifications of the EIPs and for client teams to familiarize themselves with them, not to update/change the scope of the Shanghai upgrade. Discussions about this will resume on the next AllCoreDevs call, scheduled for Oct 27th. For reference, the list of EIPs currently Considered for Inclusion in the Shanghai upgrade can be found here:  EIPs Considered for Inclusion Specifies changes potentially included in the Network Upgrade, pending successful deployment on Client Integration Testnets.

The challenge is that as part of doing core dev work there\u2019s a need to understand the protocol and asking in #allcoredevs is good for that, but a general \u201clearn about the Ethereum protocol\u201d is not something core devs will be able to keep up with. A #protocol-questions type channel is likely to become general community support quite quickly and just be too hard to keep up with. Discord just isn\u2019t the way to scale that kind of learning - it needs something more persistent like blogs, talks etc. ",

While rest in this marathon is a good idea, because at the end of the day folks have an obligation to their own personal needs, scheduling the fork (or subset) during devcon might be a good idea. Here as a test of culture, especially geopolitically. Plutocracy: As key-strokes become information for stakes, & VCs accumulate asymmetric value as a front-runned members bank on Ethereum movements from conversation. This doesn\u2019t align with what we hope to be as a people \u2018first\u2019 chain, especially with POS. most of the grife with Ethereum from bitcoin community etc. was early \u2018founders\u2019 banked.

Maybe discourse can use an index of some sort for clearer communication. Separating Project Management with Protocol conversation: We believe that project management & protocol conversation should be incorporated. depending on platform, dropdown of threads can be used to the advantage. if current platforms do no accommodate, then are alternatives open for conversation? As a note, some links that stood out during our research, while not exclusive we can dig in more if need be if the arguments are not there:   EIP1153 - case of reentrancy locks, working on \u2018till\u2019 contracts which have the feeling of counterfactual, which played out in the real world could have larger impact on getting to a clearer market view   EIP3047 - Removing WETH9?

NFT art etc. Might be a disaster for alts, but naming convention clarity might be noice.   EIP2315: relative jump as a philosophy to enable consensus builders to be shepparded into philosophical designs for stronger protocols when placed in context, with also a new OTA of subjective oriented programming becoming a greater standardized, why?

Alternatives like Urbit (reasoned through our own tests with the Matter.direct community, a sub-culture of r/NFT, especially after having a community of 60k+ people hacked)   We use Discord mostly as a matter of convenience for client devs and researchers, but it\u2019s worth noting that aside from day-to-day conversations, Discord isn\u2019t the \u201cplace of record\u201d for network upgrades. This is one of them, so are multiple Github repos, as well as ethresear.ch. Many discord channels are also bridged to Telegram. If anyone prefers to participate on TG, please ping me and I\u2019ll happily add you. As for using more \u201cweb3 native\u201d platforms, like Urbit or, say, radicle.xyz, it\u2019s definitely we consider from time to time, but currently it feels like the feature set offered + friction of migrating doesn\u2019t warrant it.
