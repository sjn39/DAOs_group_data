                    "content": " Context As part of the discussion around what to do with SourceCred, a number of individuals correctly pointed out that we should be more aware and intentional about the objectives of off-chain governance incentives. This post is intended to clarify GovAlpha\u2019s approach to these objectives. GovAlpha will post at least one follow-up to this post in the near future which will cover options and recommendations. Posts in the Off-Chain Governance Incentives Set  Off-Chain Governance Incentive Objectives SourceCred Report SourceCred and Coordinape Tool Comparison List of Options and Recommendations (coming soon.)   Off-Chain Governance Incentive Objectives  Possible Objectives There have been four major objectives that were highlighted in our discussions around SourceCred.  Attract new members to the community Retain new members of the community and compensate their time and energy. Encourage community members to take initiative and get more heavily involved in the off-chain portion of Maker Governance. Encouraging meaningful forum engagement from Recognized Delegates.   Which should we be focusing on? Given the options, GovAlpha feels that we should primarily focus on objectives two, three, and possibly four. There are a number of problems with attracting new members to the community using incentives. First, you need a solid marketing push to make people aware of the incentives. Second, most individuals that \u2018join\u2019 the community primarily due to offered incentives do not make the best community members. GovAlpha is not a marketing Core Unit, and currently, the DAO does not have a Core Unit for this purpose. Furthermore, a marketing Core Unit should ideally be able to attract new community members to the protocol without needing to rely on incentives. There are lots of great reasons to be involved in Maker! The second issue is more serious. If you sell the initiative as a way for individuals to make money, individuals will approach it with that objective and will try to manipulate the incentive system to that end. By advertising the incentives you filter for individuals who will try to maximize them.  Retention Retention is a safer objective because individuals in the forum have already self-selected on the criteria of interest in MakerDAO. Maker is a very complex system, with its own history, norms, levers, and baggage. Joining the community as a new user can be very intimidating. While compensation doesn\u2019t help reduce these costs, it can make them more bearable. This is beneficial for the protocol because it creates a small pool of individuals that have an emotional stake in Maker, and that have started to learn the institutional knowledge and culture at Maker. This positions these individuals well for further employment at Maker and continued, deeper engagement in governance. Anecdotally, this appears to be the objective at which SourceCred has been most effective so far. There are multiple core members of the community and core units that stuck around in no small way due to the existing SourceCred distributions.  Governance Actions Incentivising concrete and outcome-producing governance actions has also been a goal of GovAlpha\u2019s since SourceCred was introduced. Initially, we had hoped that the SourceCred algorithm could be modified to skew compensation more heavily towards individuals that participated in certain threads or categories connected to governance outcomes (MIPs, Signals, etc.) Unfortunately, this proved not to be feasible. However, this remains something we would like to investigate, as it has the potential to result in some meaningful wins. As an example, the community does not engage deeply with the existing ratified MIPs unless they have a concrete motive (ie they want to do something with a MIP.) This leads to lots of low-hanging fruit being ignored with respect to MIP quality and consistency. Effectively incentivizing MIP proposals may result in improvements here.  Delegate Engagement If possible, it would also be worthwhile to measure and incentivize meaningful engagement in the forum from delegates. The two delegate metrics we have currently (communication and participation) do a good job of tracking the bare minimum of a delegate\u2019s responsibilities. However, there may be room for a third metric that can track meaningful engagement in the community. SourceCred or some similar system may be a good fit for this. Even if we don\u2019t pay out using SourceCred (or similar), the data could be used to feed into the existing delegate compensation formulas. ",
