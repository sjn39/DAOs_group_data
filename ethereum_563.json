                    "content": "Recap (This is just a personal recollection, for the sake of posterity; you\u2019ll see shortly that it\u2019s of parts where I participated myself (what a surprise!..). Phrases in quotes are not actual quotes, but me paraphrasing.) The meeting lasted ~1 hour. There were ~30 (~50?..) people in the room, of various backgrounds - researchers, protocol developers, [d]application developers, auditors (security specialists?..), \u201cgenerally interested\u201d. Of those present, ~10 (15?..) voiced one opinion or the other, or asked questions. Others participated in the \u201cintroduce yourself\u201d part only. The room was \u201calmost big enough\u201d, but there were not chairs for everybody. So, during several show-of-hands, we could\u2019ve missed someone in the corner. One person had a laptop open, but I\u2019m not sure if they were taking notes, or just keeping an eye on the clock. Two topics were discussed broadly: \u201cstate storage rent\u201d and \u201cgovernance\u201d. State storage rent  A mention of why state bloat is increasingly an issue was made. A general description of \u201crent\u201d was given. Of everyone present, no one was against the idea \u201cover my dead body\u201d (via show-of-hands).  One person was willing to argue against rent if need be, for the sake of those not present. This was not explored.   \u201cStateless\u201d contracts (of the \u201cmerkle proof\u201d variety) were discussed, but not delved deep into (as they do not provide a mechanism to remove state entries \u201cno longer wanted by anybody\u201d?..). It was noted that, indeed, all contracts would have to be rewritten under the new \u201crent paradigm\u201d, as they\u2019ve so far been written without the consideration. Recent proposals by @AlexeyAkhunov were mentioned.  Of those present, only one person seemed to have at least some familiarity with those (via show-of-hands) - me, with the first one. I tried to describe a non-essential facet of the proposal, as it related to the discussion at hand: namely, that a \u201crent balance\u201d is introduced, how it is drawn from, and by whom. Think I butchered it. The core of the proposal - namely, modification of the \u201cstorage layout\u201d to allow for direct attribution of \u201cwho wrote what to the state\u201d, using new opcodes, - was not discussed. Alexey\u2019s second proposal, revolving around CREATE2, was not discussed.   The issue with rent remaining for infrastructure/\u201ccommons\u201d on-chain contracts, such as the ENS Registry (hash map) was mentioned.  Governance  Of those present, at least two were \u201csatisfied with current governance in general\u201d (via show-of-hands). The need for a systemic/actionable approach to this broad topic was raised - namely, either:  identify undesirable aspects of the current system/process, and describe approaches to get rid of them; or describe a desirable system/process, and then approaches to transition from one to the other.    (I was one of the two \u201calready satisfied\u201d people, so zoned out during most of the discussion. Someone else could provide a summary\u2026) Post-meeting There was a brief shuffle on the balcony, after which the participants dispersed throughout the congress. Assume undocumented \u201cwork in workgroups\u201d. A session (unrelated to the above) was organised by @chriseth, to present JuliaLang; was not there, can\u2019t describe. I\u2019m aware of no other Ethereum-related sessions. Ping if you do. ",
