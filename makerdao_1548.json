[Signal Request] Immediately Onboard BUSD & Introduce 0% PSM Signal Archive       Note: This is an urgent request to expedite a MIP6 & PSM launch for BUSD to diversify DAI\u2019s collateral backing.

BUSD was launched in 2019. It is issued and custodied by Paxos. Currently, BUSD is issued on both Ethereum and Binance chain (this application addresses only erc20 BUSD), with total BUSD circulating on Ethereum of ~170 million.

This is far from a new or novel issue - Maker\u2019s use of USDC has been debated umpteen times in the forums, Twitter etc. The truth is there is no easy or simple way to \u201cde-risk and decrease\u201d USDC from the protocol without causing some other kind of major issue in a domino effect. The other point to emphasise is that Tornado is not the same as Maker: we are talking about different categories of risk. It is straightforward to see why Tornado is in the crosshairs of regulators: the protocol, whatever its other benefits, is clearly a tool to launder money for North Korean hackers. It is not clear why Maker would be under risk of blacklisting by regulators/Circle and there are no signs of this happening - whereas there have been lots of danger signs for Tornado. My view is that we should be looking to diversify away from USDC, particularly where we can also generate some revenue. But I don\u2019t think the Tornado news shifts the needle very much on this.

To be fair, @monet-supply did loosely agree that he\u2019d make sure BUSD gets rolled out at some point\u2026 sooner or later. Since now it\u2019s definitely later and not sooner, by deductive reasoning\u2026 that means we should be good to go for porting over to BUSD! : ) Our reliance on USDC is solved!  /s Of course, jk\u2026 @monet-supply, I\u2019m just poking fun.   I know everyone\u2019s been quite busy lately. I fully agree that our number one priority right now is to focus all of our collective mental bandwidths on detailed expense reporting, cutting staff and expenditures, and, most importantly. making sure that all members and contributors in our community adhere to strict standards of professionalism and operate under clearly defined expectations of their roles. Once we nail that down perfectly\u2026 everything else will fall into place!  Anyway, @Moi, like I said, I hope I was just overreacting to the USDC thing. The Tornado stuff is a little unsettling. We really should diversify sooner than later\u2026 but I think we may still be okay for now.  ",
