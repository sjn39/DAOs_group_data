A public PDF version of this post can be found here.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  A16z team members put together an epic four-part series outlining some intriguing suggestions for innovating MKR tokenomics. The MCD vault and governance tracker dashboards have been updated with some cool new features! Several informal polls are underway to gauge interest in taking action to increase the competitiveness of ETH & stETH collateral.    News and Announcements A RWA DeFi ecosystem: more than just onboarding collateral @roollie from Centrifuge gave us an overview of the RWA Market on Aave after seeing many questions from the Maker community about it. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, Aave allows for creating markets where people can borrow tokens by depositing collateral. Interest rates increase and decrease depending on market utilization. The RWA market launched on December 28th of last year and represented the first diversified real-world asset market on Aave. Initially, the market launched with seven pools and allowed liquidity providers to deposit USDC. Four of the pools are integrated Maker vaults. It currently has a market size of US$19.1M, with 10.8M USDC deposited. With this market, when a pool wants to increase its capital, issuers can deposit pool tokens in the Aave protocol and borrow directly from any RWA Market investor.  This additional funding source provides stability and longevity, giving issuers peace of mind that \u201cthere are reliable sources of income across multiple fronts, similar to multiple banking relationships that a traditional company might have.\u201d Maker Operational Manual - Updates! A new Flowcharts section of the Maker Operational Manual covers Governance Flow, Urgent Governance Flow, and the Governance Process Selector. Thanks go to @LongForWisdom for creating these!  The Spanish translation is ongoing thanks to the continued efforts of the Ambassador Program in collaboration with the GovAlpha Core Unit. Starknet simple bridge limit poll: Risk assessment & mitigation This post gathers together the work done on analyzing potential risks associated with the Starknet simple bridge and exploring ways to address them. Risk Review and Mitigation  The risks related to the simple bridge were summarized in a joint post by Bartek (PECU) and Maciek (Starknet Engineering CU): Starknet DAI bridge and Starknet platform technical risk assessment. Each risk is broken down and assessed by severity and frequency of occurrence. Mitigating actions and processes have been implemented for each risk vector. A spreadsheet summarizes this work.  Risk Parameter Proposals  We propose a bridge limit\u2014the maximum amount of DAI in the L1 bridge contract, and so the maximum amount that can be lost by users\u2014of 5 million Dai. The bridge launch will require completing all the mandatory items on the checklist.  Vaults (MCD) & Governance trackers transfer The Data Insights Core Unit gave a short update about the vault and governance trackers, which have been transferred to new addresses. beta.mcdstate.info is now available at tracker-vaults.makerdao.network.  1809\u00d7960 204 KB  beta.mcdgov.info is available at tracker-gov.makerdao.network.  1811\u00d7960 297 KB  The new trackers are faster and have some nice new features, including:  New vault charts End-of-day snapshot history for vaults Full protocol parameter history for governance  Any feedback is appreciated as well as feature requests.

Flash Loan Debt Manipulation During Emergency Shutdown Vulnerability Postmortem @Kurt_Barry of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit submitted a detailed postmortem of the emergency shutdown vulnerability discovered July 2021 when DssFlash was integrated with the mainnet protocol deployment. In short, the flash mint module, DssFlash, allows Dai flash loans to be taken out in newly minted Dai, which is repaid at the end of the transaction. During the execution of a flash loan, the outstanding debt of the system is correspondingly increased. This debt value is read and cached at a particular step of the Emergency Shutdown process. Because of the vulnerability, a malicious actor could have taken out a flash loan during the shutdown process and called this read-and-cache function in the same transaction, causing an anomalously high debt value to be recorded. This would have reduced the collateral disbursed per-DAI compared to the \u201ccorrect\u201d value. Since this devalues post-shutdown DAI, the attacker could have secured a profit by shorting Dai before executing the attack. In the short term, this attack vector was mitigated by deploying a module that allows DssFlash to be permissionlessly disabled after an emergency shutdown. In the near future, a mechanism for disabling flash mints after a shutdown that does not require extra Keeper intervention will be implemented. Check out the full post for more details, including a timeline and lessons learned. Additional information: Post-Shutdown Flash Loan Vulnerability - Announcement and Remediation Plan Quick Comparison of stETH lending markets Maker vs. AAVE  1239\u00d7834 115 KB  @lyt of the Strategic Finance Core Unit published a comparison of stETH lending markets on Maker and Aave. If you\u2019re not familiar, stETH is the token users receive for depositing ETH into Lido Finance\u2019s decentralized Ethereum 2.0 staking protocol. Aave\u2019s stETH collateral has seen a big increase, leading to Maker\u2019s market share, defined as the total value of wstETH in Maker vaults vs. the total value of stETH/wstETH stored as collateral in Aave pools, dropping from 100% to 29%. However, when we look at stETH collateral backing stablecoin loans, this more \u201capples to apples comparison\u201d yields more promising results. In @lyt\u2019s words, \u201cUsing this comparison, Maker market share is truly 77.6% by collateral value. By value of stablecoin loans drawn against stETH/wstETH collateral, Maker market share is 73.1%.\u201d Could some of this liquidity be coaxed into leaving Aave for Maker? @lyt concludes that while $132M of stETH collateral on AAVE and $41M of stablecoin loans drawn against that stETH could potentially be moved over to Maker, the addressable market is not currently very substantial and probably not worth expending resources to target.   Active Discussions  A16z MakerDAO Tokenomics Proposal Overview Members of the A16z team, including Luca Pro, co-authored a four-part proposal titled \u201cSuggestions for Community Discussion: Innovating MakerDAO\u2019s Token Model.\u201d In the initial overview post, the team explored the existing MKR tokenomics model and introduced its three-pronged approach to innovating it. Under the existing model, Maker\u2019s profits are directed to filling a System Surplus Buffer. When the Buffer has a surplus, MKR tokens are permissionlessly bought back and burned to boost the price of the MKR token. As has been pointed out by several Maker contributors, the buy-and-burn model may not be optimal for achieving the community\u2019s broader long-term goals. With the aims of \u201cmaximizing value creation, creating new utility for the MKR token, adding an additional yield-bearing layer of financial resiliency, and increasing the durability and efficiency of governance processes,\u201d the team has put forward three proposals for discussion, each with its own separate post.  The following posts were submitted as a three-part thread, which has a separate overview available summarizing all three proposals: A16z MakerDAO Tokenomics Proposal One: Adding Utility Functionality to the MKR Token This proposal, split into three sub-proposals, focuses on increasing the utility of the MKR token. Sub-proposal 1: Require MKR as additional on-chain collateral for any RWA-based or structured vaults involving less transparent off-chain liquidation mechanisms, ideally as a first-loss capital. This MKR can also be combined with other external assets like ETH as an on-chain collateral package. This requirement would be in addition to the normal RWA collateral structure. This change could help improve the alignment of the borrower and serve as an additional margin of safety. Sub-proposal 2: Create a Secondary Surplus Buffer to serve as an additional layer of consumer protection (in line with the Self Insurance Fund proposal) that offers a yield distribution to those who voluntarily stake their MKR. Much like other major DeFi insurance pools, these tokens would be used to help backstop a potential shortfall event, in this case, one beyond that of the System Surplus Buffer. Sub-proposal 3: Incentivize auction participants to stake MKR in collateral auctions, better aligning the interests of auction participants with the overall interests of the system. The main idea is to offer a discount, applied as a rebate, to the collateral auctioned for participants who stake their MKR in the auction. A16z MakerDAO Tokenomics Proposal Two: Aligning Governance Incentives This post, focused on aligning governance incentives across the Maker ecosystem, is also broken down into three sub-proposals. Sub-proposal 1: Incentive Alignment: One idea to address incentive alignment among the MakerDAO workforce, MKR delegates, and MKR holders is to reward both regular voters and official delegates with a vesting bonus denominated in MKR tokens based on MakerDAO\u2019s long-term performance and each contributor\u2019s cumulative activity. Sub-proposal 2: Participation: There are various pros and cons to weigh regarding a possible Curve-inspired \u201cveToken\u201d model application to MakerDAO. There could be some benefits to rewarding long-term participants with more voting power; however, @NikKunkel and @monet-supply both raised excellent counterpoints against implementation of the proposal as written. Sub-proposal 3: Information and Expertise: One item that could be especially helpful to the community is a new governance dashboard that clearly shows the linear flow for proposals, provides links with details to discussions (the forum is like a maze even for experienced users, let alone new ones), and organizes topics in a way that any newcomer can easily understand. A16z MakerDAO Tokenomics Proposal Three: Increasing Financial Resiliency and Fostering Growth The series concludes with the third and final proposal: Increasing the System Surplus Buffer to begin aligning it with calculated, vault-specific expected losses related to credit and liquidation risk as the primary insurance pool for MakerDAO. To summarize the reasoning, \u201c@krzkaczor elegantly outlined why MakerDAO should focus on aggressive growth with retained earnings: capital is hard to come by and should be used most efficiently to achieve more long-term earnings. Given the start-up nature of MakerDAO and its incredible potential, capital could be reinvested in ways to improve Maker\u2019s profitability and sustainability as it grows.\u201d For now, the team suggests that MakerDAO could keep the Surplus Buffer at $250M while the community decides on capital allocation routes and finalizes the metrics that determine its size. Moderating \u201cSuspicious\u201d Accounts This post gives us an overview of how GovAlpha engages in forum management in response to several inquiries about new accounts, suspected sock puppets, and forum moderation. Generally, moderators prefer only to take action on posts that are \u201covertly against policies and expected behaviors.\u201d All forum members can flag posts, DMs, and public comments they feel warrant closer scrutiny by the moderators. The post also provides a list of \u201ccommunity considerations\u201d\u2014questions for moderators to ask themselves and for forum users who favor a more active approach to moderation to consider:  Should accounts that attempt to obscure their speech patterns (using specific vernacular, \u201cbroken\u201d English, or other formulaic tools) be treated with greater suspicion? To what extent is it the moderator\u2019s job to \u201ctone police\u201d criticism in an effort to promote healthy dialogue? Should anonymous/pseudonymous authors be treated the same as known members of the community? What is the appropriate escalation of moderation? When should accounts be banned, if ever? Who should have the power to moderate these discussions, and how should their work be evaluated? Are there steps/procedures we can implement to limit spam and encourage more discussion on governance proposals?  The discussion has already begun, so feel free to throw your two cents in if you\u2019re interested in forum moderation and management. [Informal poll] Actions to increase competitiveness of ETH & stETH collateral stETH, the token users receive for depositing ETH into Lido Finance\u2019s decentralized Ethereum 2.0 staking protocol, has been gaining in popularity as DeFi collateral. Maker, however, has seen stETH adoption slow down since late February. We learned in the comparison post between the Maker and Aave stETH markets, adoption on Aave has been rising rapidly. This post offers informal polls regarding three different ways to increase MakerDAO\u2019s competitive advantage in this area: 1. Shall we add a stETH vault-type with a lower liquidation ratio? Pros  Allows users to increase their exposure to stETH Higher stability fee can be requested for this  Cons  Could see the usage of ETH-B moving to this new vault-type, which could increase the risk to Maker protocol Increases risk to Maker protocol in case of lost peg between stETH and ETH  2. Shall we add a stETH vault-type with a higher liquidation ratio? Pros  Allow users to get cheaper liquidity with their stETH, attracting more risk-averse users Can increase the total amount of stETH collateral in the Maker protocol ETH-C users might switch, which could net more SF revenue if SF for this vault type is higher  Cons  stETH-A users might switch, which could net less SF revenue if SF for this vault-type is lower  Increases risk to Maker protocol in case of lost peg between stETH & ETH    3. Shall we request core units to investigate aETH as collateral in Maker? Pros  Allows users to go long on the supply-side interest rate for ETH on Aave Adds downward pressure on the interest rate on Aave for ETH, making borrowing DAI with ETH on Maker more attractive  Cons  The downward pressure on the ETH interest rate on Aave might make stETH on Aave even more attractive  The informal polls will run until March 28, 2022.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 There\u2019s only one active signal request right now? I don\u2019t believe it! [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG Sebastien from the Strategic Finance Core Unit revisits the topic and attempts to push PAXG to be onboarded. All risk assessments have been submitted during 2020:  [PAXG] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Domain Community Assessment [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment (MIP10c3-SP16) [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation  Additionally, PAXG was previously approved for onboarding through a governance poll. Today, both market cap and liquidity for PAXG have significantly increased, and the Uni V2 pool, although small, is handling 2M of hourly volume and 50M daily. Parameters proposed for PAXG are a Debt Ceiling of 5M, Liquidation Ratio of 125% (which may be instead set to 130%), and a Stability Fee of 4% that may also be altered based on current situations. Sebastien provides the pros and cons of onboarding PAXG and concludes the signal request by asking the community whether they want to onboard PAXG as a collateral type in Maker\u2019s MCD? Vote will run until April 5, 2022. Here are the current voting results:  1677\u00d7995 137 KB    Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  Check out the discussions (1, 2) on improving off-chain governance incentives via SourceCred.  Part 2 discussing the strategies towards implementing market liquidity is now available! To burn or not to burn; growth solutions may increase MKR speculation without burning MKR.    ICYMI - Announcements [3F Delegate Pre-Vote Notice] SES Incubation of the Proposed Talent Core Unit is Inadequate While attending ETHDenver, @flipflopflapdelegate had conversations with @manomad about his goals as a Talent Core Unit facilitator, offboarding processes, and the unique necessity for Human Resource procedures. Many questions were discussed regarding potential improvements for Core Unit incubation and education of recruitees. 3F Delegate believes that the SES Core Unit requires additional resources to help improve their incubation process and align cross-Core Unit communication because Maker Talent presents some concerns with their KPI reporting, the long-winded search for a facilitator, and readiness to deliver. 3F Delegate believe that SES should have performed a fitness investigation prior to releasing Talent CU on-chain. The recent successful strategic focus approach that @lenkla and her SES teammates placed on gathering Project Xray could have been used to understand if current CUs promote positive sentiment toward HR procedures. In conclusion, 3F Delegate believes the Maker Talent Core Unit cannot create a hiring forecast going six months out. Nonetheless, we applaud the team for being resilient and willing to demonstrate their value to the DAO. Growth Core Unit Offsite The Growth Core Unit had an offsite in Mexico from February 7th to 11th, 2022. Participants included the Growth Core Unit team and members from various CUs (PECU, Oracles, DI, and one Delegate). Objectives for this offsite included: Building relationships between CUs. Looking back on all the work achieved in 2021. Presenting strategic initiatives for this year. Presenting upcoming opportunities. Understanding various perspectives between different Core Units and members. The Growth Core Unit presented their completed agenda, which can be found in the original post. Outcomes from the offsite were positive and helpful; there was a shared conviction that involved relationships will further enhance collaboration and communication between Core Units. The teams have identified Maker priorities that will require collaboration in the coming weeks and months. In addition, they identified the priorities that are of particular concern to the Growth CU. Visit the original post for a detailed list of the Maker and Growth priorities mentioned above.  NPS score (n=9): 90% ! (8 promoters and 1 neutral at 8/10)  Forum maintenance announcement - Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022, 9-10 UTC The TechOps Core Unit performed maintenance work on the forum on Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022, between 9 and 10 UTC. Activities included:  Upgrading the Forum to the latest version. Applying security fixes. Installing a necessary plugin. Updating some configuration and configuration files.  For current and future maintenance progress, keep an eye on or subscribe to the MakerDAO Statuspage or the #general channel on Discord, where TechOps posts live updates. Progress Update on the legal structure for Centrifuge RWA vaults @elidco shared the progress on the legal structure for Centrifuge US-based assets. They introduced the Jersey Real World Asset (RWA) structure and explained how they expect this structure to work in the future. The Jersey structure will provide formalization for Centrifuge\u2019s pool transactions and is intended to better protect investors and issuers from potential litigation claims. It also provides a consistent and coherent story for discussions with regulators and third-party service providers such as custodians and banks. Two key changes are highlighted:    Progress Update on the legal structure for Centrifuge RWA vaults    We propose that issuers appoint a third-party trustee to act on behalf of the DAO and other investors. The trustee will be able to protect the interests of the DAO and ensure independent control of the assets. It would also handle distributions in case of default, leaving it no longer in control of the issuer or a liquidator. We are in initial discussions with some potential trustees. The second proposed change is the introduction of a lock-box. A lock-box is a term of art meaning a segregated account for assets held outside the control of the issuer and the SPV. This structure means that the SPV assets are no longer in control of the issuer but in control of the trustee. It will be the role of the trustee to receive and handle payments to and from the lock-box and make sure the right parties (for example, Maker) receive the payments. This means the issuer does not control the funds from the borrowers to the Maker vault, reducing the risk of loss of funds or misuse of funds by the issuer.    Using this structure should make it easier to bring TradFi players into DeFi, which will expand the types and quantity of real-world assets available to Maker. Centrifuge and @christiancdpetersen provide a work-in-progress schematic of the Jersey RWA structure.  The Centrifuge team just had a Community AMA Call; keep an eye out for the video recording and editorial transcription to be posted in the AMA Call thread!

You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 SourceCred and Coordinape Tool Comparison Adding to the ongoing discussion about using SourceCred to reward MakerDAO contributors, @LongForWisdom has put together a comparison of SourceCred and Coordinape, a similar tool.      SourceCred Coordinape     How to use Users feed data to the algorithm by just using the forum. The algorithm fetches forum information by using its API Users need to connect to Coordinape site and manually allocate their GIVE to other members of the circle each period (epoch)   Target team/org size Performs better when used in relatively large groups/communities. The larger the community, the more data it can evaluate to produce better results Although a circle can have 200+ users, they are thought to be used for smaller groups where members interact with each other since it can become difficult to remember contributions from tons of users   Contribution evaluation precision It can measure lots of contributions easily in an automated way, but its precision depends on every user in the forum correctly understanding how the algorithm works and what giving a like represents It offers a more direct reward allocation mechanism where every user gets a limited amount of tokens that they can distribute based on how valuable they think other users contributions were   Overhead SourceCred needs maintainers to ensure the instance works well and develop the best configuration parameters based on weights given to contributions, which can take time. They also handle user onboarding and distributions generation Coordinape circles and user information live inside Coordinape DBs and can be accessed through their app, making maintenance almost unnecessary. Distributions are easily generated at the end of an epoch, and the members can handle user onboarding.    Off-Chain Governance Incentive Objectives Continuing the SourceCred discussion, @LongForWisdom made a post aiming to clarify the objectives of off-chain governance incentives. Four main objectives were identified:  Attracting new members to the community. Retaining new community members and compensating their time and energy. Encouraging community members to take the initiative and get more heavily involved in the off-chain portion of Maker governance. Encouraging meaningful forum engagement from Recognized Delegates.  GovAlpha feels that the focus should be on objectives two, three, and possibly four. As @LongForWisdom points out, \u201cMaker is a very complex system, with its history, norms, levers, and baggage,\u201d which can make it intimidating for new members to join. SourceCred distributions have already been shown to improve retention. Incentivization may improve governance actions, such as higher quality MIP submissions. It may also be useful to measure and incentivize delegate engagement on the forums. Off-Chain Governance List of Options and Recommendations Continuing the SourceCred discussion, @TheExistence presented a set of options and recommendations to encourage governance engagement within the community with greater precision and effectiveness. Once again, the objectives are:  Retention: Retaining newer community members and compensating them for their time and energy. Governance Initiative: Encouraging community members to take the initiative and get more involved in the off-chain portion of Maker governance. Delegation Engagement: Encouraging meaningful forum engagement from Recognized Delegates.  To achieve these goals, the post outlines seven different options together with their pros and cons:  New SourceCred Instance   Pros  Separate budgets. More transparency. Greater predictability and flexibility in the allocation of incentives.   Cons:  Separation in two instances does not ensure greater participation or encourage community engagement. Greater management and operational costs.     Exclude Groups from SourceCred   Pros  Prevents Core Unit members getting double-paid and reducing payouts to other contributors. Facilitators are paid and mandated to communicate actively with the MakerDAO community. Delegates are already paid. SourceCred could provide input into that payment rather than paying out to delegates as part of SourceCred.   Cons  On-going maintenance cost, adding and removing accounts as employment status changes across the DAO. Causes issues when an individual goes from excluded->included due to how SourceCred tries to make catch-up payments. Excluding delegates may be counter-productive to objective C. We want to incentivize delegates to engage in the forum.     Limit Rewards from SourceCred   Pros  Incentives placed more efficiently with contributors not affiliated with the DAO receiving larger SourceCred payouts.   Cons  Risk of Sybil abuse by employees of the DAO to avoid limits Core Unit Members and Core Unit Facilitators less incentivized to engage with the community     Reduce/Remove SourceCred   Pros  Reduction in the budget will reduce perceived overpayment when only a small number of engaged and active contributors. Allows budget to be used to trial or run other off-chain incentive options. Removing all payments or the entire system would remove the ongoing maintenance costs.   Cons  Individuals currently benefiting from SourceCred would no longer benefit (or not as much) SourceCred provides useful information in the form of Cred scores separately from issues of monetary incentive that would be lost if we abandoned it completely. Would reduce the incentives for delegates to be very active in the community if these were not replaced in some form. Several upfront costs paid in relation to SourceCred would no longer provide many benefits if it were completely removed.     Delegate Engagement Metric   Pros  Encourage Delegate\u2019s engagement. Add a new indicator of the Delegates tracking performance, making the evaluation of their contributions more accurate.   Cons  More work to track and produce delegate metric reports. Greater management costs for option B since Coordinape is likely to have an ongoing management cost than the SourceCred instance.     Direct Proposal Incentives   Pros  Directly helps with objective B, encouraging community members to trigger governance processes with tangible outcomes. Should result in better community knowledge of the governance processes.   Cons  Risk of spam proposals, though this should be partly mitigated by the \u2018if successful\u2019 clause. Some upfront cost to develop a framework to determine how proposals are rewarded, especially with multiple authors or contributors. On-going maintenance cost, though not hugely problematic given the existing GovAlpha involvement in the governance processes.     Coordinape   Pros  It generates direct recognition of each other\u2019s value by manually allocating Give between members. Indicator of the value that Core Unit Members bring to their working groups Sybil resistant.   Cons  Doesn\u2019t scale well. Although a Circle can have many members, they are thought to be used for smaller groups where members interact since it can become difficult to remember contributions from tons of users. Potentially more management cost.    The post closes with a pair of recommendations and asks trust_level_2 forum members to participate in a poll. Recommendation 1a:  Slightly increase existing delegate compensation to balance removed access to SourceCred rewards. Use the third delegate metric (engagement) input into the existing delegate compensation formula.  Recommendation 1b:  Create a new SourceCred instance for Recognized Delegates and divert some of the SourceCred budgets to this instance. Change the payout formula to 100% recent contributions.  Expectations of a delegate Recent discussion concerning whether to exclude certain categories of contributors from SourceCred led to a debate concerning delegates and their role, which revealed a gap between expectations and reality of what delegates do and should be doing. @JustinCase assembled an overview of the current state of requirements for delegates accompanied by expectations previously expressed across the forums. JustinCase aims to initiate a discussion about these expectations and push for a clearer consensus from the community on what kind of delegates they want going forward.    Expectations of a delegate   The formal requirements to become a delegate is as follows:  Sharing contact details Publishing a delegate platform post. Appearing on a live call to speak to MKR holders and community members to answer questions about their platform. Publicly agreeing to follow a Code of Conduct.  Following the code of conduct gives certain responsibilities that require a time commitment:  Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal prior to the submission of their vote Delegates should ensure that they communicate the rationale behind each of their votes in a clear and accessible way. Delegates should maintain a working knowledge of developments at Maker and in the wider cryptocurrency space. Delegates should - within reason - be accessible to the community to answer questions, respond to comments, and discuss issues.    Expectations by the community:    Expectations of a delegate    Should delegates work full time as delegates (time commitment expectation tied to compensation) Should delegates stick to Maker exclusively or be free to work for other protocols at the same time (non-compete considerations) Should delegates be part of a core unit (possible conflict of interest) Should delegates initiate governance processes like signal requests or MIPs (possible separation of powers issue, same person initiating and voting on a proposal) How closely should delegates be involved with Core units? (time costs, possible infringement on CU autonomy) Should delegates communicate with outside entities on behalf of Maker? (possibly creating expectation of protocol action)    A culminating question arose from these requirements and expectations; how active should delegates be in shaping the community? Please visit the original post and submit your feedback or opinions! The case for payouts to token holders In this post, @someone asked what gives MKR value without \u201ca possibility of cold hard cash being distributed to MKR holders in the distant future,\u201d listing several potential arguments for holding MKR and explaining why they think these arguments don\u2019t work.  MKR tokens give you voting power.    @someone argues that while voting power may be desirable for some people who want to influence the protocol for non-financial reasons, it doesn\u2019t generate any financial value.   Burning tokens increases the Earnings Per Share ratio.   \u201c\u2026if there will never be a method for returning cold hard cash to holders (as opposed to buybacks), there\u2019s never going to be any \u201cearnings\u201d distributions, so really the EPS is 0 (or, conversely, P/E ratio is infinity).\u201d   Burning tokens increases buy-side pressure and so increases MKR price.   But the moment we trade some DAI for MKR to burn, we are not worth more; we are worth the same because we are down an equivalent amount of Dai.  Framing The Debate on Market Liquidity - Part Two - Strategic Goals GovAlpha core unit contributor @LongForWisdom has published the second part of his series to facilitate discussion about how and why to increase the market liquidity of DAI and MKR. While Part One discussed Decision 1: How does MakerDAO fund its liquidity strategy?, Part Two focuses on Decision 2: What is our liquidity strategy aiming to achieve, and how? Part Two focuses primarily on objectives: What does MakerDAO stand to gain by implementing a market liquidity strategy? Part Three will bring the focus to practical methods for achieving these objectives. The post outlines three potential goals a liquidity strategy may seek to achieve and what makes them desirable.  Increasing adoption of DAI on L2s, sidechains, and other L1 chains Increasing DAI adoption on other chains will increase the demand for DAI directly and indirectly, ultimately \u201cconvert[ing] directly into revenue and profits\u201d for MakerDAO.  Attempting to add DAI to the ranks of USDC and ETH as a default routing token for on-chain liquidity Securing a place alongside ETH and USDC as a default routing token will dramatically increase demand for DAI and encourage further adoption.  Dampening MKR price movements and increasing ease of entry into and exit from the token Improving MKR liquidity across the market will help reduce MKR volatility, bolstering MakerDAO\u2019s resiliency. It will also make it easier for MKR holders and potential holders to enter and exit positions. Read the full post for a detailed breakdown of these objectives, their potential risks and benefits, and a discussion of how we can achieve them. Proposal for the Creation of a MakerDao Nft Marketplace @cryptenthusiastic proposes the creation of an NFT marketplace in which 2% of sales commissions will be distributed as follows:  1% for the Maker treasury 0.6% to the buyers (each in proportion to their purchases) 0.2% to increase the multi-collateral backing of Maker Collection 0.2% for maintenance and reinvestment in the development of the marketplace.  Under this proposal, each NFT will be backed by a certain number of different tokens, giving them a more consistent floor price. Against the burn @krzkaczor has previously promoted and discussed the benefits of growing the Surplus Buffer to fuel revenue growth. Now, he presents his argument to disable the burn in the belief that burning MKR before we dominate the stablecoin market is very shortsighted. Kris provides a summary of MKR and burn history, which has been happening for years, and displays that despite the fundamental theory, MKR burn and MKR price increase does not correlate, and simple mkrburn data analysis proves this\u2026 unless it\u2019s a very massive burn! We have seen a very large amount of MKR burned during January 2022, which influenced an increase in MKR price that ultimately reverted. Rekt   The buying pressure caused by burning ~1% of total supply yearly is just too small to cause a supply crunch anytime soon. We would need to burn huge amounts of MKR (a few % of supply) every year to see immediate burn effects.  Kris believes that we should focus on aggressive growth, which can be easiest done by growing the Surplus Buffer. That new revenue can then be reinvested, avoiding the risk of flop auctions. In addition, we are currently facing a DAI supply crisis. We will need to use our cash flows to help DAI dominate the stablecoin market; DSR, cashback, and increasing the real world DAI adoption \u2013 it all requires a lot of funds. In conclusion, Kris believes that a joint refocus on MakerDAO growth is exactly what will make MKR price more speculative.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Implement Governance Mining Trial Signal Request Ends March 2nd In recent months, a decline in governance participation has been brought to light. Unfortunately, attracting engaged, informed voters is a problem that has largely gone unsolved. @GFXlabs believes it is time to take an actionable approach through a governance mining trial to help improve voting participation to compare polls treated with potential payments vs. polls before and after the treatment and the difference between treated/untreated and governance participation one year earlier. The initial trial is aimed at polls, with more straightforward metrics to monitor. The design of this trial includes an assurance payment of .1 MKR provided to any address that contributes \u2265 1 MKR in a non-abstain vote on at least one low-turnout poll. A maximum of .1 MKR may be awarded to any address for any individual closing date of this trial. All MKR rewards will be sourced from the MakerDAO treasury. A budget of 8 MKR will be reserved for this trial. This trial will be in effect until the MKR budget is exhausted or after six weeks, whichever occurs first. This design offers the potential for payouts without guaranteeing that MakerDAO will incur expenses and provide a meaningful reward to smallholders willing to provide a public good at their own expense. @GFXlabs agrees to take management of the reporting and administration of this trial. They will track and provide public updates on which addresses (if any) are eligible for assurance payments following the close of each trial date. @GFXlabs will provide a written report (via forum post) and oral report (if desired) on a Governance & Risk call after the close of the trial.  Pros:  Potentially increases governance participation, particularly among smaller holders Offers payments only when marginal increases in participation are needed Allows experimentation with a novel mechanism without committing to large or ongoing payments Trial will be administered by GFX Labs to avoid adding to the governance burden of core units    Cons:  Could incur a maximum expense of 8 MKR and 1000 DAI May not generate conclusive results If chosen to be extended or made permanent, this program would likely require an increased workload to administer on an ongoing basis Will require some measure of marketing/communication to make MKR holders aware of the trial program If the assurance payment amount of .1 MKR is too low to attract voters to polls, then rewards would accrue to those already voting rather than the marginal voter   @GFXlabs is asking the community whether MakerDAO should implement the Governance Mining Trial. Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot Signal Request Ends February 25th The Ambassador Program, which provides non-English-speaking communities with resources and educational materials, had its funding disrupted by the offboarding of MKT-001. @Kat took the initiative to spearhead the Program without the attachment of a Core Unit and is seeking 25,000 DAI to complete the pilot and associated projects over the next three months. She is asking the community whether MakerDAO should fund the Ambassador Pilot Program. Allocate 20M to Protocol-Owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP Signal Request Ends March 3rd In response to a recent discussion, @psychonaut believes the simplest method for improving MKR liquidity is to add protocol-owned Dai/MKR LP shares to UniV2. He asks the community whether Maker should allocate 20M to a protocol-owned UniV2 MKR/Dai LP and presents his argument that the pros outweigh the cons:  Pros:  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g. Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc.) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set it up and forget about it)  Cons:  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise large amounts of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is nearly the opposite of flop auctions    Bring Back the MKR Burn Part II Signal Request Ends March 4th @ultraschuppi states that the recent executive vote to temporarily disable Surplus Auctions and MKR burn had intentions to return to the original lerp mechanic. However, an on-chain poll added the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module. In response, Schuppi asks the community whether the protocol should return to the previous partial burning configuration as agreed in November, but with the following conditions:  The Rate Limiter has been installed on mainnet; this will take a couple of weeks. An initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set.

I see Cordinape as a more direct system, a karma system. In short, sourcecred limits the inclusion of new users to participate, that is undoubtedly true. But I do not think it is right to pay double to those who are already employed by the DAO (my personal opinion). As mentioned there, it is possible to increase their payment so that it is a greater compensation than the sourcecred. I mean equally their work is correlated to being active on the forum. ",

Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  There is no Governance and Risk Call on Thursday, February 17th. Check out the new and improved Delegation Resources thread. Welcome our new Delegate, Doo Nam. Join him on the Meet Your Delegate #10!     ICYMI - Announcements Maker Academy\u2019s First Status Update! Please give a warm welcome to Maker Academy and its first status update! Maker Academy has finished the mock-up of its website and is en route to complete and release an initial version by the end of March 2022. Also, content for the incubation program and onboarding programs are coming soon. Maker Academy presents community needs and their associated tasks to meet those needs: Need #1: Onboarding Material Task A: There is a lack of onboarding material for MakerDAO. Maker Academy will both create content and facilitate content. Task B: To scale content production, Maker Academy plans to incentivize a decentralized workflow of content production using content bounties. Task C: Maker Academy will cooperate with SES to produce educational content used during the incubation program. Need #2: Contributor Pipelines Task A: Maker Academy\u2019s educational site will track users and show content. To complete the pipeline, Maker Academy will have a contributor portal that explains the different methods of contribution and lists current opportunities for contribution. Need #3: Primary Education Platform Task A: Maker Academy plan to improve their website and create a written content mock-up. Task B: Maker Academy plans to improve upon past educational websites released by the Maker Community by adding many more useful features when it comes to education. Task C: Maker Academy is currently using MongoDB to store its data. They will eventually have to store a lot of content and user information, so it is important to optimize it. Check out the original post for more information on community needs and associated tasks. SourceCred Report @TheExistence and @hernandoagf have completed their report on SourceCred performance. Here are some key takeaways:  The Governance Forum currently has 1,157 users who have generated at least 1 Cred, and only 120 contributors have opted in and have been rewarded at some level by the algorithm. 908 users have joined the Governance Forum since the algorithm is in operation. 764 users have generated at least 1 Cred, and 76 new users have opted in. 23% of registered users in the forum opted in after adopting the algorithm. Of the 120 current users who participated in the program, 63% were not part of the Maker community prior to the adoption of SourceCred. Engagement metrics selected in the report are engaged users, likes, new contributors, page views, forum visits, topics created, and posts created.   985\u00d7605 48.7 KB   The number of users receiving payouts over time can also serve as a proxy for overall activity. Secondary Approach - Sampling: A sample study selected 20 collaborators who participated in the protocol to measure their activity before and after receiving their first payment as a reward for their contributions. Findings:  There are 4 (20%) collaborators who have increased their activity, 5 (25%) who remained constant, and 11 (55%) who decreased in their production of posts and topics. The sampling shows a practically null correlation between the incentive of the first payment and an increase in productivity.  7 (58%) of the 12 users received more likes, and only half of the universe received a greater number of replies to their posts. There is no clear correlation observed between the monetary incentive and an increase in the quality of the discussion, expressed in the likes and broader participation of the rest of the community in the posts created by the contributors of the sample. ROI of SourceCred breakdown: The SourceCred initiative spent 75,000 DAI in 2020 and was projected to have an estimated budget of 361,400 DAI for 2021. By the end of the year, 82% of the budget was executed for a total of 297,562 DAI. In the first 3 months of 2021, the foundation financed the program, but since March 2021, Gov-Alpha has been in charge of its financing and implementation. Another finding shows that the top 1 contributor has collected 19,372 DAI, and the 120th has collected 21. The top 3 have received more than 15,000 DAI each, the top 8 have all received more than 10,000 DAI, and the top 15 have all received more than 5,000 DAI, while 55% (66 of the 120 users who have opted in) have received less than 1,000 DAI. 9 users of the top 15 (60%) receive payments by other means in the DAO. Solution: A possible solution could be to propose a percentage deduction from SourceCred payouts to users who already receive DAO payouts by other means. That would favor dispersion, spilling into more users, while most of the top contributors would not see their interests in participating in the discussion affected since their main incentive to do that lies elsewhere. In conclusion, It was impossible to establish a correlation between the monetary incentive proposed by the algorithm and a higher production or quality in the discussion by users. Nor was it possible to find a constant trend capable of standardizing or structuring a user\u2019s behavior. Also, The overall activity of our Governance Forum was much higher in 2021 compared to 2020. Analysis of the engagement metrics shows that the discussion grew substantially, intensifying the governance process in the DAO. Payouts have proven to be highly centralized to a handful of users. The highest decile has received the same accumulated pay as the remaining 9, and of those top 12 users, 7 work directly or indirectly in the DAO. Check out the original post for more detailed information on the research, results, and next steps. No Governance and Risk Call - 2022-02-17 As a result of a majority of the Maker community attending ETHDenver (as well as the super bomb  DaiVinity event which had us all dancing our feet off), GovAlpha decided it is best to skip Thursday\u2019s, February 17th, Governance and Risk Call. Next week\u2019s G&R Call during February 24th will resume as normal. Delegation Resources @LongForWisdom publishes a thread containing all resources related to delegation. It includes a General, for Recognized Delegates, and MKR Holders categories of links. Thanks! Doo Delegate Platform @Doo_StableLab steps in as a delegate and presents his delegate platform. Doo\u2019s objective is to be interested in the Maker protocol and hear and share their feedback with the greater Maker community. He plans to connect the West and East by communicating with various Asia communities and reflecting them in voting. Currently, the Maker protocol is mainly in English, and many non-English communities are declining as the strategy and management are lagging. We need to provide more content in different languages. Finally, Doo will support sound proposals to lower transaction fees and/or gas costs. @Doo_StableLab will be presenting his delegate platform at the Meet Your Delegate #10 happening March 2nd, at 6 PM UTC.

Insights that fuel sustainable developer growth strategies at MakerDAO The SES Core Unit shares with us their second major report on the developer journeys into and inside of crypto & Web3 ecosystems. They collected responses from 519 developers representing 140 crypto ecosystems and 20 different industries outside of crypto. We have witnessed that developer talent and capital are rapidly flooding into the crypto/Web3 ecosystem, indicating growth with 18K+ developers now consistently contributing to the space. However, there are headwinds on the horizon. Key challenges for crypto/Web3 developer growth:  Price cycles and interest to action gap. Skepticism, criticism, and FUD.  To help fight these challenges, SES believes it is best to keep the crypto/Web3 technical interest alive and growing. It is also important to double down on efforts to help grow the developer community.  1380\u00d7776 73.1 KB  Developer growth rate has been low compared to other ecosystems.    Why do developers join crypto/Web3 and keep contributing to the space? Insights that fuel sustainable developer growth strategies at MakerDAO   Crypto/Web3 developer journey survey findings We have analyzed 519 responses and categorized them into 3 distinct developer profiles:   Crypto Curious  developers (outside of crypto but interested in joining full-time)  Current Crypto developers (contributing to crypto/Web3)  MakerDAO developers (past or present Maker protocol contributors)  For each of these profiles, we have mapped the developer journey consisting of 3 main stages:   Awareness (insights into crypto discovery, learning, interests, and AHA! moments)  Onboarding (insights into focused learning, top resources, tech & career bottlenecks, and AHA! moments)  Retention (insights into satisfaction, most loved & frustrating, and reasons for churn)    Awareness takeaways:  Being on the frontier of technology is the primary driver that has pulled developers into Crypto/Web3. Most current and crypto-curious developers have discovered crypto through their social circles or popular social networks like Twitter and Reddit. The crypto AHA! moments for prospective crypto devs revolve around the tech\u2019s vision, problems, and builders. Current crypto devs, problems, use cases, and builders ranked the highest.  Onboarding takeaways:  For MakerDAO devs, they have to overcome an additional set of hurdles. Specifically the \u201cprotocol complexity,\u201d \u201cprevious commitments,\u201d and \u201cfeeling of being intimidated by the skilled team and the community.\u201d  Retention takeaways:  Developers in crypto are very satisfied with their careers. The average for all crypto developers is 8.4. When segmented to developers that work within DeFi, the score reduced slightly to 7.9. MakerDAO developer satisfaction average a very high 9.2. Developers were asked what the most frustrating aspects of working in the crypto industry are. The answers centered around the \u201cuncertainty of regulation,\u201d \u201chype from speculators,\u201d and \u201cnegative crypto narratives in the media.\u201d Frustrations specific to MakerDAO developer/contributor experience include \"coordination, collaboration & knowledge sharing among core units\u201d and the aspects in which \u201cthe documentation & learning materials could be improved.\u201d  The insights gathered help SES identify and refine the strategic opportunities. Having the tactical ways to solve challenges and act on insights identified, we all need to get the ball rolling. The SES team uses the X-Ray insights actively to inform its current and future initiatives. Check out the original post for a more detailed breakdown of the research and insights.

You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 Statement regarding B.Protocol v2 and Maker integration and risk considerations As a follow up to [WBTC-B] and [WBTC-BProt-A]: Review and Plan of Action and the latest B.Protocol v2 Declaration of Intent, the Risk Core Unit have decided to recommend freezing the declaration of intent to integrate until further notice due to the reasons listed in the post. From the Risk perspective, they believe that the integration has no downside. Nevertheless, they have doubts about DAI demand for BAMM, especially if we want to scale this integration into hundreds of millions of DAI minted. Additionally, DAI deposited into BAMM effectively reduces supply on the market, adds pressure to DAI premium, and increases PSM stablecoin reserves. Arguments supporting a delay:  Lack of potential of B.Protocol v2 to scale to sufficient level required by Maker. Concerns such as that DAI can be withdrawn at any time from the BAMM contract, meaning that there is no guarantee that the DAI suppliers will follow through with a large market drawdown. The low LR WBTC-B vault demonstrates the general lack of demand for higher leverage.  Risk CU believes that benefits from integrating with B.Protocol v2 at the current time do not outweigh the opportunity cost of resources needed to achieve current objectives.  If B.Protocol can demonstrate high demand for dai locked in BAMM and implements time lock mechanism, we think this proposal has more potential of being implemented sooner. Still, for the time being, we think CU resources would be better spent by focusing on L2 and D3M type of modules.  [Discussion] Open Discussion with TrueUSD @AnnabelTUSD opens up a public discussion thread as an opportunity to discuss with the community and address any grey areas there might be or any issue that remains unsolved with TrueUSD.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 [Signal Request] Implement Governance Mining Trial Signal Request Ends March 2nd The decline in governance participation has been previously discussed and brought to light. Unfortunately, attracting engaged, informed voters is a problem that has largely gone unsolved. @GFXlabs believes it is time to take an actionable approach through a governance mining trial to help improve voting participation to compare polls treated with potential payments vs. polls before and after the treatment and the difference between treated/untreated and governance participation one year earlier. The initial trial is aimed at polls, with more straightforward metrics to monitor. The design of this trial includes an assurance payment of .1 MKR is provided to any address that contributes \u2265 1. MKR in a non-abstain vote on at least one low-turnout poll. A maximum of .1 MKR may be awarded to any address for any individual closing date of this trial. All MKR rewards will be sourced from the MakerDAO treasury. A budget of 8 MKR will be reserved for this trial. This trial will be in effect until the MKR budget is exhausted or 6 weeks, whichever occurs first. This design offers the potential for payout without guaranteeing there will be an expense for MakerDAO as well as a meaningful reward to smallholders willing to provide a public good at their own expense. @GFXlabs agrees to take management over the reporting and administration of this trial. They will track and publicly update what addresses (if any) are eligible for assurance payments following the close of each trial date. @GFXlabs will provide a written report (via forum post) and oral report (if desired) on a Governance & Risk call after the close of the trial.  Pros:  Potentially increase governance participation, particularly amongst smaller holders. Offers payments only when marginal increases in participation are needed. Allows experimentation with a novel mechanism without committing to large or ongoing payments. Trial will be administered by GFX Labs to avoid adding to the governance burden of core units.    Cons:  Could incur a maximum expense of 8 MKR and 1000 DAI. May not generate conclusive results. If chosen to be extended or made permanent, this program would likely require an increase in the workload to administer on an ongoing basis. Will require some measure of marketing/communication to make MKR holders aware of the trial program. If the assurance payment amount of .1 MKR is too low to attract voters to polls, then rewards would accrue to those already voting rather than the marginal voter.   @GFXlabs is asking the community whether MakerDAO should implement the Governance Mining Trial. MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp Signal Request Ends February 18th The Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier poll passed, which led to compensation calculation changes for December. However, one delegate, @MakerMan, received no compensation for November and would have received 8,245 DAI if the new compensation model had been in place. In response to this event, @prose11 has submitted a signal request asking the community whether the protocol should pay MakerMan the 8,245 DAI for his Recognized Delegate duties in November, calculated based on the December formula change. Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot Signal Request Ends February 25th The Ambassador Program, which provides non-English-speaking communities with resources and educational materials, had its funding disrupted by the offboarding of MKT-001. @Kat took the initiative to spearhead the Program without the attachment of a Core Unit and is seeking 25,000 DAI to complete the pilot and associated projects over the next three months. She is asking the community whether MakerDAO should fund the Ambassador Pilot Program. Allocate 20M to protocol owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP Signal Request Ends March 3rd In response to a recent discussion, @psychonaut believes the simplest method for improving MKR liquidity is to add protocol-owned Dai/MKR LP shares to UniV2. He asks the community whether Maker should allocate 20M to a protocol-owned UniV2 MKR/Dai LP and presents his argument that the pros outweigh the cons:  Pros:  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g., Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc.) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set up and forget about it)  Cons:  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise lots of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is practically opposite to flop auctions    Bring back the MKR burn Part II Signal Request Ends March 4th @ultraschuppi states that the recent executive vote to temporarily disable Surplus Auctions and MKR burn had intentions to return to the original lerp mechanic. However, an on-chain poll added the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module. In response, Schuppi asks the community whether the protocol should return to the previous partial burning configuration as agreed in November, but with the following conditions:  The Rate Limiter has been installed on mainnet; this will take a couple of weeks. An initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Where else can this post be found? Online public PDF version Medium publishing soon! | GovComms Medium Account   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  A new Core Unit is being proposed for incubation. The Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit aims to create a network of legal professionals who can help onboard new real-world assets in a scalable way.  Towards taking asset risks - A primer analyzes several assets in an exploration of ways to invest Maker revenues into productive assets. The GovAlpha Core Unit will be trying out a system of impact estimations, making it easier for community members to gauge the importance of new governance items.  February\u2019s Expenses vs Budget is now up! Check it out.   News and Announcements Introducing Impact Estimations Summary The GovAlpha team is currently looking into applying \u201cimpact estimations\u201d to active MIPs and Signal Requests. The primary goals are to:  Provide delegates, core unit members, and the wider community with an idea of how important it is to pay attention to a given governance item during a limited time. Provide a clear escalation path for reviews within GovAlpha (e.g., if a newer member of the team reviews something they think should have a \u201chigh\u201d impact score, it can be escalated to a member with more experience).  For this initial trial period, GovAlpha will give a \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d impact score to active governance items for the next several months to gauge their effectiveness and measure community sentiment about the initiative. While each impact estimate will ultimately depend on the person making the judgment, GovAlpha will generally attempt to adhere to a basic set of guidelines: Likely High Impact  Anything that adds concretely identifiable risk to the Maker Protocol Anything the DAO is doing for the first time Anything that removes a non-trivial amount of money from the surplus buffer Core Unit onboarding and offboarding Anything that permanently changes governance processes or structures within MakerDAO  Likely Medium-Impact  Items that may lead to later decisions that add risk or deplete the surplus buffer Anything that removes a trivial amount of money from the surplus buffer  Likely Low Impact  Minor wording changes and/or fixes to existing MIPs   Attention TUSD-A Users: Collateral Offboarding Timeline Update Summary MakerDAO TUSD-A users have been unable to change their vaults for the past several weeks due to a change in the token\u2019s implementation. A March 25 executive vote has returned full access to these Vaults for affected users. Users now have two weeks to make the necessary preparations before TUSD-A is offboarded.  SES Incubation Announcement: Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit (LTS) Summary @christiancdpetersen of the Real World Finance Core Unit made a post announcing plans to incubate a Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit. The idea of this CU is to develop an independent network of legal professionals with the skills and expertise to help scale the onboarding of new real-world assets into Maker vaults. Why a legal CU? @christiancdpetersen explains what makes transaction lawyers valuable and what they could bring to the Maker ecosystem: In real-world finance, transaction lawyers:  Collaborate with commercial, risk, and technical teams to identify and find solutions to mitigate various commercial, legal, technical and other risks. Drive and manage deals towards closure. Communicate with relevant stakeholders. Manage and supervise external counsel. Generally support the financing process.   LTS lawyers will have similar roles for support opportunities that reach the DAO. They may:  Undertake transaction due diligence involving the legal structure of entities, counterparties, and fiat/Dai flows. Research applicable legal requirements and obtain local counsel as needed. Negotiate commercial and legal positions, implementing the DAO\u2019s legal risk appetite. Review borrower-provided lending documents, supporting the process through closing and disbursement. Coordinate cross-Core-Unit initiatives to solve multidisciplinary challenges. Perform transaction management by preparing and negotiating the term sheet, financing agreements and ultimately coordinating transaction scheduling. Perform post-closing transaction management, providing administration of events during the deal\u2019s life. Provide transparent and open communications with all stakeholders and the MakerDAO community.  The proposed facilitator of this CU is Christian Petersen, an experienced lawyer and the author of this post.  MakerDAO Actual Expenses vs Budget - February 2022 Summary The February update on monthly Core Unit expenses is hot off the presses, including forecasting for March, April, and May. In a nutshell:  Dai expenses decreased by $0.3M to $2.3M Forecasted Dai expenses are expected to increase to $3M/month by April   Adding in estimated annual Oracle gas costs of $5.1M, these metrics bring us to an annual cash burn rate of $41.4M, representing a $0.6M decrease from January\u2019s estimate. Additionally, we have enjoyed a significant decrease in gas costs associated with Oracle use as the NFT market slows down and gas prices fall.    Active Discussions Towards taking asset risks - A primer Summary  This week, we highlight @SebVentures\u2019 post exploring ways to invest the MakerDAO balance sheet into productive assets. In the Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Framework for MakerDAO, asset risk is defined as \u201casset fluctuation risk over the long-term,\u201d plus an additional value at risk (VaR), thought of as \u201cthe minimum amount of equity required to safely hold such an asset and be in line with MakerDAO risk appetite.\u201d If you want to learn more about VaR, check out Measuring Market Risk by Kevin Dowd and Risk Management in Banking by Jo\u00ebl Bessis. (Note: It is important to be aware, as the author points out, that the VaR paradigm remains fiercely debated in the finance world.) After providing a formal definition of VaR, we encounter our first case study: ETH. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of ETH, while volatile, is impressive overall.  966\u00d7583 18.7 KB  As @SebVentures points out, we know that much of the price action going forward will be linked to the burning mechanism and the inflation rate. While these are expected to eventually settle into low single-digit numbers, a 50% or 100% metric for return on assets (RoA) is prudent for the coming years. The VaR/RoE model is given below for 50%, 100%, and 200% RoA.  Judging by our model, @SebVentures concludes that ETH seems to be an investment option worth exploring despite its high volatility. However, this strategy will require a bigger Surplus Buffer and will not help make Maker\u2019s idle assets more productive. Check out the full post for further case studies and conclusions on gold, short-term corporate bonds, short-term treasury bonds, and short-term blended bonds.   Request to Poll for Maker Wormhole Deployment and Associated Risk Parameters Summary In support of MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit is requesting a poll on approving L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals. This will require the approval of several parameter changes. Parameter Summary Approve the following gateways (domains), as documented in MIP69 and the GitHub implementation:  Optimism Arbitrum  Debt Ceiling Parameters  Set the Optimism Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M Dai Set the Arbitrum Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M Dai Set the Global Debt Ceiling to 2M Dai, as a sum of all debt ceilings for each domain  Wormhole Fee Parameters per Domain  Set the Arbitrum Wormhole Fee parameter to 0 Set the Optimism Wormhole Fee parameter to 0  Approve Oracle Quorum of (TBD) Feeds This is the minimum number of feed attestations required to complete a Fast Withdrawal transaction and will comprise any of the 25 oracle feeds provided by the Oracles team.  Clarity Around Collateral Onboarding Process Summary The Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES) seeks to clarify and expand the collateral onboarding (COB) process. So far, we have primarily been using the COB process outlined here. By this process, the COB process should begin with a collateral onboarding application, as defined in MIP6. This is how we have defined \u201cgreenlit\u201d collateral up to now: \u201csomething that has followed the MIP6 process leading to an onchain poll.\u201d However, the community has been experimenting with different signaling support methods for different collateral types. Going forward, CES will recognize collateral as \u201cgreenlit\u201d if a non-MIP6 is ratified or an onchain passing vote has taken place for it.    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG Summary Sebastien from the Strategic Finance Core Unit revisits the topic and attempts to push PAXG to be onboarded. All risk assessments have been submitted during 2020:  [PAXG] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Domain Community Assessment [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment (MIP10c3-SP16) [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation  Additionally, PAXG was previously approved for onboarding through a governance poll. Today, both market cap and liquidity for PAXG have significantly increased, and the Uni V2 poll, although small, is handling 2M of hourly volume and 50M daily. Parameters proposed for PAXG are a Debt Ceiling of 5M, a Liquidation Ratio of 125% (which may be instead set to 130%), and a Stability Fee of 4% that may also be altered based on current situations. Sebastien provides the pros and cons of onboarding PAXG and concludes the signal request by asking the community whether they want to onboard PAXG as a collateral type in Maker\u2019s MCD? Vote will run until April 5, 2022. Here are the current voting results:  1677\u00d7995 137 KB     Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and DAI holders?\u2019  Participate in new Signal Requests for onboarding Notional Finance and PAX Gold.  Learn about the recently uncovered flash loan vulnerability and how we can mitigate it. Vote on GovComms\u2019 post to help decide which topic is best for their upcoming Issue Discussion Call.    News and Announcements Protocol Engineering Core Unit Workstreams Protocol Engineering has identified several optimizations to its internal structure; they are formalizing it into three workstreams (Core Protocol, Cross-Domain Scaling, and the Safety Workstream). This post describes the optimizations being considered and is intended to be referenced alongside their new budget request.  Protocol Engineering\u2019s Current Operating Model:  As PE team members have naturally gravitated towards their strengths and/or interests within the bounds of our team mandate, it starts to require clearer ownership as cross-dependent workstreams begin to form. With PE undertaking such a broad scope of work, the current budget renewal offers an opportunity to introduce structural changes set up for success while also improving transparency to the community.  Protocol Engineering\u2019s Existing Mandate:   1232\u00d7586 119 KB  the overall mandate has not changed since the team\u2019s formation; the definition of these vertical focus areas can be better categorized:  773\u00d790 5.54 KB   The Core Protocol workstream is concerned with depth and all interactions that touch the Maker Protocol on L1. The Cross-Domain Scaling workstream is concerned with the breadth and all initiatives that seek to scale MCD in a multichain world. The Safety workstream is concerned with safety and is the go-to for all protocol correctness and security-related initiatives.   Formalizing Protocol Engineering\u2019s Team Structure  The structure is not necessarily a difficult task because it already informally exists today. However, it still requires formally assigning ownership within the core unit.  1380\u00d7744 145 KB  The mandated actors will not be new hires - they are experienced, team members. The role of the mandated actors will be to represent the workstream with architectural vision, technical leadership, and strategic oversight, working alongside the Facilitator for a united core unit vision. The role of the core unit facilitator will remain as it is today, managing the strategy, operations, and cross-community communication requirements of the core unit while assisting the mandated actors in their duties and shielding the team from distractions.  Setting the Team and the New Structure up for Success:  To support this new structure, PE is proposing to grow the core unit by three individuals:  Product Manager / Coordination Engineer for the Cross-Domain Scaling Workstream Smart Contract Engineer for the Cross-Domain Scaling Workstream Smart Contract Engineer for the Core Protocol Workstream  Check out the original post for additional information and reasoning behind each section of the post, as well as the benefits of the proposed structure. [Mar9 \u201922] Post-Mortem for Immunefi bug report #5565 On February 11th, 2022, a report from a whitehat hacker, smsecurity, was submitted to the Immunefi bug bounty platform, on a vulnerability affecting the Governance Portal. The vulnerability was classified as \u2018Medium\u2019 severity. DUX team patched the vulnerability and deployed a hotfix. A bug bounty of 2500 DAI was granted to the whitehat hacker and is currently pending payout. The DUX team patched the vulnerability through the aforementioned changes based on the report and further investigation. To fix the vulnerability, a hotfix was deployed outside of our usual biweekly release cadence. Check out the original post for a detailed analysis and additional mitigation steps. SourceCred Bi-Weekly Happenings #1 GovAlpha publishes their first issue of SourceCred Bi-weekly Happenings. March, so far, had 19910 DAI distributed based on Cred scores.

March, so far, also had a total of 13,967.38 Cred has been generated with 167 topics, and 1,414 posts created:   Check out the original post for more data and information into recent SourceCred activity. Remaining Autonomous MakerDAO Budget Returned    Remaining Autonomous MakerDAO Budget Returned   The (closed and inactive for quite some time) Autonomous MakerDAO working group has returned the remainder of the budget requested here  in January of 2021. The final transaction can be found here  and sent the remaining 28,640.09 DAI to the DssBlow contract , which was then returned to the surplus buffer here . Transfer history for this multisig can be found here .   Post-Shutdown Flash Loan Vulnerability - Announcement and Remediation Plan On Thursday, March 3rd, a vulnerability was found in the Maker protocol involving the DAI flash loan module (\u201cDssFlash\u201d) and the Emergency Shutdown (\u201cES\u201d) process. With the way the system is currently set up, a bad actor could take out a flash loan and call the thaw function before repaying it, causing outstanding Dai to be read by the End module as higher than normal. The bad actor could profit from this state of affairs by shorting Dai before the attack. For now, the mitigation plan involves a module being deployed that can permissionlessly disable the DssFlash module after Emergency Shutdown has been triggered. An executive vote on adding this new module will begin on March 9th, 2022. GovAlpha also mentioned the submission for this out-of-schedule executive proposal. The executive is currently live on the portal and can be found here. [CurveLP-stETH-ETH] Parameters Adjustment With CurveLP-stETH-ETH collateral approaching mainnet launch, the Risk Core Unit made a post reviewing the original CurveLP-stETH-ETH risk parameters and providing an updated set of recommendations.

Meeting ID: 832 5830 0025 Passcode: QSR001 Monetalis MIP6 - Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation The Real World Finance Core Unit published an extensive risk evaluation for onboarding Monetalis as collateral. Ultimately, the team recommends not onboarding Monetalis as collateral, \u201cas it presents significant, off-market risks to Maker across three key dimensions:\u201d  Facility Risk: Monetalis underperforms, and Maker incurs a significant loss on its loan. Maker Reputation Risk: Counterparties do not want to do business with Maker due to negative publicity or concerns regarding Maker\u2019s credit investment activities, governance processes, or overall DAI stability. DAI Stability Risk: The market views the collateral backing the DAI as risky due to significant weaknesses in its asset managers, assets, and/or investment structures.  The post dives deep into the topic, including the following sections:  Executive Summary Proposed Structure & Economics Risk Assessment Methodology Facility Risk Assessment Market Transaction Comparison Investment Grade Standard Arm\u2019s Length Transaction Standard Market Reputation Risk DAI Stability Risk Conclusion  Monthly Core Unit Updates: February 2022 @Artem_Gordon compiled the monthly Core Unit updates into one easy-to-reference forum post.

Active Discussions  \u2018What is going on? You think what?! You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 Fire drill, request for discussion + informal polls Immunefi Security has a core unit mandate to perform a fire drill. However, their fire drill was delayed because it turned out that nobody knew exactly what we were supposed to do. Today, executive spells are often passed in less than 24 hours and usually within a few days. However, this is still not quick enough during an emergency response. Psychonaut proposes the following:  A fire drill will be declared every month at a random day and time. Delegates will be asked via emergency communication channels to sign a message. Reaction time will be measured and recorded.  Conducting a periodic fire drill will ensure that Recognized Delegates can react promptly to an emergency. In addition, a plot of reaction times shall be displayed on a Delegate\u2019s information page, which will help MKR holders decide where best to delegate their MKR. Median (or some other quantile) reaction time could be incorporated into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier. In conclusion, psychonaut asks the community the following questions through an informal poll:  What is the recommended frequency for fire drills? How quickly should a Delegate react? Should we incorporate some reaction time measure into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier?  Visit the post, and don\u2019t forget to vote! [Informal Poll] Issue Discussion Call #5 For the next Issue Discussion Call happening March 23rd, Thomas provides a list of suggested topics is inquiring from the community which of these topics pose the greatest interest. Options:  How do we meet our growing external communication needs (social media, website, branding)? What steps would improve the Core Unit budget modification process? Abstain Is Real World Asset Fast Tracking a viable solution? Open Suggestion What ways could we improve the onboarding process?  Content Production Core Unit Offboarding Post Mortem Forum members had a lot to say about this post discussing the first Core Unit offboarded by MakerDAO, the Content Production Core Unit. After the onboarding, four primary issues came to light with how offboarding is handled in Maker, particularly concerning internal CU finances and post-offboarding obligations to the DAO. Offboarding Expectations The Core Unit MIP Set did not formally propose Offboarding Expectations and Procedures. This led to a situation where, following offboarding, there were \u201cexpectations of labor during a transition period, without the promise of compensation.\u201d In practice, following the vote to offboard the Core Unit, there was \u201ca total cessation of all work by the former Core Unit.\u201d Returning Core Unit Funds There are also no formal requirements for Core Units to return unused funds when they do not utilize their full monthly budget. This is likely a DAO-wide vulnerability. Commitments Made by Former Core Unit After offboarding a Core Unit, \" unresolved business may remain, particularly regarding third-party contractors and Core Unit contributors. \u201cUltimately, the community must answer the question of what should be done in the case of unfulfilled commitments by an offboarded Core Unit.\u201d Entanglement of Key Infrastructure Different Core Units have differing access to pieces of key Maker infrastructure. Revoking and reassigning the relevant permissions in a standardized way will be an important aspect of saving post-offboarding labor after future Core Unit onboardings. Recommendations    Content Production Core Unit Offboarding Post Mortem    Create an incentive structure (\u201cgolden parachute\u201d) for teams that complete an end of the Core Unit transition. The reward should unlock key milestones for a smooth transition. This recommendation needs active ownership as it is outside GovAlpha\u2019s wheelhouse. Separating Continuity funds of Core Units from the main operational wallet. Ideally, these should have 3+ signers required from other areas of the DAO to keep excess funds safe and legitimate in the event of an offboarding. GovAlpha will be putting this into practice shortly, and we intend to encourage others to do so as well. Establish standardization/procedure for periodic budget returns. I believe @wouter has already thought deeply about this subject within the context of Auditors Wallets, and we both encourage and offer assistance in crafting a DAO-wide mandate. Amend MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management to clarify setting up and suggestions for best practices. In addition to applying practical lessons from our first year with this MIP, I intend to highlight that Proxy revoking powers will only be relevant in issues of lost keys. Expect a replacement MIP to be submitted before May for RFC. Review access to key infrastructure, attempting to avoid siloed access maintained by a Core Unit that could be offboarded. This is probably best suited for groups like @immunefi-core-unit @daif-core-unit, though GovAlpha is happy to lend our institutional knowledge to this endeavor.    What Core Units does the DAO need next? The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit Team published a post outlining the redesigned Core Unit Incubation Program. This latest iteration, aimed at improving throughput and effectiveness, begins in Q2. The team has put together a comprehensive list of ideas for new Core Units to be assembled and onboarded:  Transparency Reporting Support Core Unit Software Quality Assurance Core Unit Accounting Support Core Unit Accounting Support Core Unit Red Team Core Unit MIPs Review Services Core Unit Smart Contracts Auditing Core Unit Management Support Core Unit DAO Resiliency Auditing Core Unit MarComms CU1 Events Core Unit Community Development Core Unit Makernaut Support Core Unit Developer Relations Core Unit End-User Dai Adoption Core Unit Integrations Support Core Unit Advocacy & Public Policy Core Unit Regulatory Advisory Core Unit Self Insurance Core Unit Legal Network Coordination Core Unit Core Unit Incorporation Support Legal Review Core Unit Special Purpose Core Unit(s) Transparency Reporting Support Core Unit  While the full public announcement about the redesigned Incubation Program is still a couple of weeks away, the post gives a preview of a few of the main themes:    What Core Units does the DAO need next?    The tentative timeline we are targeting has the start of the program in the second half of April, with graduations in November, i.e., in the last governance cycle of 2022. The program will feature three separate tracks: Outreach, Legal Resiliency, and Transparency & Quality Control - three focused curricula for the facilitator candidate to choose from, critical to the development and sustainable scaling of MakerDAO. Contrary to last year\u2019s approach of full coaching teams, this program\u2019s season will focus on training the facilitator candidates. Focusing attention on the facilitator candidates aims to increase the number of Core Units added to the DAO over the year while providing the best onboarding experience that empowers the participants to successfully lead their teams.    The list of potential new CUs and the redesigned Incubation Program are not final and are currently under heavy discussion.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Real World Asset Fast-Tracking The GovAlpha core unit has posted a signal request aiming to:  Clarify Real World Asset (RWA) issuers\u2019 options for getting onboarded into Maker. Gather feedback on a \u201cfast-track process\u201d idea to ease friction for existing RWA issuers that have worked with Maker in the past.  There are currently two main ways RWA issuers can propose being onboarded:  Work with the Real World Finance Core Unit using the weekly governance cycle. Propose a new MIP.  The GovAlpha team strongly recommends the first option. Regarding a fast-track process for existing issuers, @LongForWisdom points out that exiting issuers have noted a delay between proposing the onboarding of a new RWA and concrete decision-making about that proposal. The goal of the fast-track process is to minimize this delay. Pros and cons include: Pro: This shows that Maker can be flexible and sensitive to issues facing RWA issuers/arrangers that wish to work with MakerDAO. Pro: Could allow MakerDAO to onboard RWA faster, leading to more DAI minted and increased revenues. Con: Requires Maker Governance to decide whether proposed collateral is safe and benefits Maker without evaluation from core units. Con: May expose Maker to additional risk due to imperfect legal frameworks. Con: Undermines the mandate of the Real World Finance Core Unit. Con: Bypasses the monthly governance process.

At issue: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount 6 Considerations (not pros and cons):  Increase the payout for critical severity web bugs from 5k-50k to a single amount of 50k. Reduce negotiation around the critical severity bounty amount. Increase incentive for whitehat hackers to pursue Critical potential severity web bugs.  Onboard D3M For Notional Finance Recognized Delegate GFX Labs is signaling to onboard a D3M (DAI Direct Deposit Module) for Notional Finance\u2019s 3-month-maturity DAI lending pool 1, with an initial debt ceiling of 10 million DAI (unless recommended otherwise by Risk Core Unit).    [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance   Pros:  Increased revenues. As of writing, the 3-month rate on Notional is north of 7%, on a base of around 85m DAI. For example, even a trial 10m DAI DC would firmly put a Notional D3M in the top 10 ilks by revenue. (10m DAI is currently estimated to suppress rates only to 6% as of writing)   For reference, estimated yearly revenue from other top ilks are below:   Increased control over the front end of the yield curve. Strategically, Maker\u2019s use of D3Ms across multiple lending venues will exert control over more of the total market, dampening effects of fragmented liquidity for DAI, as well as volatility during market downturns. Being fairly insensitive to gas costs, Maker\u2019s D3M for Aave has allowed for steady DAI rates even in the face of intense volatility. That stabilization can also be applied to the very shortest portion of the yield curve. Diversification of counterparties. Maker currently faces existential risk from various counterparties: Circle, Lido, Bitgo, Paxos, and occasionally Aave. By growing DAI supply and increasing the rate by which the Surplus Buffer grows, a program of diverse D3Ms advances the goal of reducing excess reliance on individual counterparties. Familiar credit risks and technological risks. The risks represented by exposure to Notional\u2019s overcollateralized lending platform (listed under Cons) are risks that Maker has deep expertise in evaluating and monitoring through Collateral Engineering Services, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Units. Reduced reliance upon stablecoin collateral. As of writing, the DAI supply is 68% backed by stable collateral, the bulk of which is 5,300,000,000 USDC and nearly 500,000,000 USDP. D3Ms can scale quickly and are limited only by the depth of their deployed markets, allowing them to grow as demand for DAI on the lending platform grows. Not only does this increase DAI supply, but it should also lower the demand for the PSMs, as there are alternative methods of obtaining DAI.   Cons:  Smart contract risk. There is always smart contract risk with any protocol-to-protocol interaction. Steps to mitigate this for Notional include an audit by ABDK, a $1,000,000 bug bounty program on Immunefi, analysis via Code4rena, formal verification via Certora, and a pending diligence report by Consensys. Multisig risk. Notional\u2019s governance mechanisms are still in the early stages of decentralizing. At the moment, key portions of the protocol are governed by a 3 of 5 multisig. No firm timeline is set, but the multi-sig\u2019s admin powers are intended to be phased out over time. A possible mitigant of risk to Maker is that one of its delegates (GFX Labs) is one of the signatories, and all signatories are fully doxxed 1. Note that other underlying collaterals already in Maker\u2019s portfolio also include governances with multisigs, so this is not a novel form of risk. Illiquidity risk. If the amount of DAI in the liquidity pool drops due to LPs withdrawing their capital, there may be insufficient liquidity for Maker to withdraw 100% of its capital prior to maturity. It should be noted that Maker will always be able to withdraw its capital upon maturity regardless of the liquidity in the pool. This illiquidity risk only refers to withdrawals prior to maturity. A gradual scaling of maximum exposure can keep in mind to mitigate this. Capital loss risk. If liquidations do not perform properly, capital loss is risk. Notional has built a robust liquidation infrastructure 1 and currently utilizes conservative parameters. Being an overcollateralized lending platform, the risk of bad debt stemming from default is, in principle, low. While probably unnecessary for Maker, there is also coverage available for Notional under Nexus Mutual. Oracle risk. Notional utilizes Chainlink oracles for the four listed assets. Maker is already exposed to Chainlink oracles via Aave and (soon) Compound.    Onboard PAXG Another Signal Request for new collateral onboarding was posted by the Strategic Finance Core unit, this time for onboarding PAXG (PAX Gold).    [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG   Pros  Gold might be an important building block for DeFi. When we onboarded WBTC, it was small and unproven in DeFi; since then, it has been an important piece, in part thanks to MakerDAO. The same thing can happen with PAXG. DeFi can provide yield for gold and attract TradFi people This onboarding might increase our relationship with Paxos. US Dollar dominance is under attack (especially after the weaponization of the dollar), and strong inflation is on the menu. Both are good for gold.  Cons  Gold can fall into oblivion soon. The current rates increase are bad for gold. PAXG is centralized by Paxos Demand can be lacking, and we would incur a loss and a defocus (Oracle costs)      Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Check out and vote on the proposal to aid Ukraine by sending Dai. Submit your feedback and opinions for new educational content here.    News and Announcements Flipside Crypto Delegate Platform Welcome to @fig and his governance team at Flipside Crypto, who have thrown their hats into the ring and announced their recognized delegate platform. Flipside Governance was established in September 2021 to directly support, contribute to, and drive participation in partner communities, helping improve the efficiency of this critical piece of protocol health. The team operates in various DAOs and communities, such as Aave, SushiSwap, ENS DAO, OlympusDAO, and many others. Flipside Crypto presents some of its accomplishments to show its value as a delegate in the MakerDAO community. Flipside Crypto believes there is plenty of room for improved proposals, a greater understanding of the governance landscape, and strong relationships with key players and stakeholders. The team believes governance is best achieved through:  Proper education (what votes mean and why) Fairly distributed voting power (quadratic voting, voting rewards) Engaged, rewarded community members  Flipside aims to represent the views of a range of users and provide unique analytics to justify their data-driven decisions. As delegates, Flipside Crypto promises:  Constant monitoring of votes and participation in each vote Open discussion and contribution to the DAO forum and Discord Transparency about when they vote and how they vote A shared commitment to the future success of Maker  Conflicts of Interest:  ENS Delegation Paladin Delegation/Transferability Committee Aave Grants  Flipside Crypto Delegate presented their delegate platform on Wednesday, March 2nd during the Meet Your Delegate #10. [EXECUTIVE VOTE NOTICE] 3F Delegate Cannot Support an INCREASE of the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling 3F Delegate states their opinion to not increase the GUSD PSM DC. They believe there is a lack of motivation supporting the recent executive vote.  1380\u00d7160 182 KB  The Growth CU team has indicated to 3F Delegate that there are no deals in their pipeline associated with GUSD. Growth does maintain an open relationship with Gemini, but increasing the GUSD PSM is not a priority for either party.

Comments Calculations around starting/leaving delegates:  Recognized Delegate\u2019s MKR weight is measured once per day, which is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with is an average of the days they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for part of the month.  Performance Modifier: The vote to introduce a Performance Modifier passed on-chain. monetsupply\u2019s amount was amended by the Performance Modifier this month\u2014see Notes column in the table above. Distribution: Recognized Delegate Compensation will be distributed as part of the first Executive Vote of the month. Parameter Changes Proposal The MakerDAO Open Market Committee has put forward a set of proposed parameter changes:  WSTETH-A: Increase debt ceiling to 300M and gap to 30M. This will \u201callow Maker to meet growing demand and cement our position as a leading DeFi platform for liquid staking tokens.\u201d DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Reduce bar to 2.85%, increase the debt ceiling to 300M, and increase the gap to 65M. This \u201cis expected to lead to full or nearly full utilization of the D3M debt ceiling, which should drive a roughly 3M increase in annualized protocol revenue despite a marginal decrease in deposit rate earned.\u201d  The proposed changes, if confirmed, should increase yearly revenue by about 3 million Dai due to an increase in expected debt exposure to the Aave D3M. The MOMC is not recommending any other rate or parameter changes at this time but may submit a mid-month proposal depending on how market conditions develop.  *Looking for more posts and updates?

Active Discussions  \u2018What is going on? You think what?! You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 Ukraine Vault/Loan/\u201dWar Bond\u201d Purchase Proposal @Allan_Pedersen has submitted an informal poll proposing that Maker lend 1-5M DAI to Ukraine to aid their ongoing war effort. If the community supports the idea, Oasis Pro Markets and Monetalis have pledged to help execute it using real-world collateral.    Ukraine Vault/Loan/\"War Bond\" Purchase Proposal   I cannot, exactly, at this hour, tell you what will be the specific means of execution, but I will strive for getting to a situation where, as real-world collateral, we will have a loan obligation from the Nation of Ukraine (preferably a recognized bond) held by a Monetalis-Maker BVI Trust (or similar) structure and then a vault, set up specifically for this situation, and an immediate DAI minting (and probable exchange to USD) and payment.   Polls are currently underway to gauge support for the loan and the amount if the proposal is approved. Maker Academy: Educational Content Poll [Forms Now Accessible] The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit seeks feedback on what it should focus on when producing new educational content. Fill out the forms to share your perspective:  Topics in Governance Relevant to MakerDAO Organizational Topics Relevant to MakerDAO Financial Topics Relevant to MakerDAO Legal Topics Relevant to MakerDAO Topics Relevant to the Maker Protocol\u2019s Architecture Topics in Development Relevant to the Maker Protocol  Offloading growing Centralization risks to Maker and DAI. Opening a general discussion @MakerMan made an extensive post discussing Maker collateral custody centralization. USDC, wBTC, USDP each account for over 500M worth of collateral. Because these assets are issued and controlled by centralized entities, there is a chance that this collateral could be removed at any moment. @MakerMan argues that such an event\u2019s effects on the MKR market cap and DAI adoption are not well understood. He outlines both a set of potential solutions and a set of questions these issues raise.    Offloading growing Centralization risks to Maker and to DAI. Opening a general discussion   Put; the collateral risk is centralized at the vault level. Worse, Dai in being over collateralized is rapidly approaching at best a 100% collateralized due to the PSMs. With the tin/tout, 0/0 Maker makes ZERO return on parties laying off their collateral in exchange for DAI. Solutions all involve one form or another of growth.  Try to get more decentralized collateral on-board (well, oracle costs are causing MakerDAO to offload collateral, creating an increasing collateral concentration risk) Bring on institutional vaults. This again centralizes counter-party risk because instead of having 100\u2019s or thousands of autonomous agents managing risk on a finer grain, Maker instead has maybe ten players responsible for over 50% of the collateral assets. This means (as we have seen in the past week) a single player can shift their assets away from Maker and significantly decrease our revenues. This will eventually be seen in the surplus buffer dropping vs. rising. RWF. Frankly, to date, RWF hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Nor does it appear to be materializing in a way that helps us at all with risk. In the loosest sense, practical concerns are causing our RWF players to want large vaults that they manage because doing deals for specific collateral 10M or even 50M at a time won\u2019t scale to B\u2019s much less a T DAI borrowed. If Maker brings on even one player and gives them a 500M DC, we then centralize our exposure to a centralized player again.  \u2026 So here we are left with questions.  What is the latency to apply such collateral? Is this using one kind of centralization to offload risk of another kind of centralization Does it cost more or less to have more or less centralized players with more or less DC. (i.e., take 4B and spread 400M across ten managers cost more than 1B across 4? which is better or worse) Does having an arranger model where we have single arrangers with 1B vaults (even institutions) create its form of centralization risk that puts the protocol at risk. Is having a single deal or chunk deals of 100-200M simply not practical to manage this risk, and then is MakerDAO forced to centralize Is there any other approach that could mitigate this growing centralization risk, more D3Ms Maker finally taking the step to grow a treasury of assets we can borrow DAI against as a secondary backstop before MKR is flopped - that is liquid and not centralized (say Uniswap, GUNI, and other assets in DeFi that has reduced price and value volatility that maybe can also earn a return while providing DAI liquidity in case of losses).    Multi-protocol stablecoin stability vault @jrkirby proposed an idea for improving the stability of \u201cstruggling stablecoins\u201d as a way to \u201cimprove Dai stability, help alleviate the demand for Dai, and additionally to provide revenue to the protocol.\u201d The idea involves collaborating with another stablecoin protocol to back a stability vault jointly. \u201cWhen someone creates a vault, both protocols will jointly mint stablecoins, such that no stablecoin trade imbalance is needed to create (or liquidate) vaults.\u201d @jrkirby argues that many stablecoin protocols would jump at the chance to generate such liquidity, \u201ceven with terms more favorable to makerdao.\u201d Intra DeFi stablecoin issuers money-market @SebVentures detailed his idea for a decentralized clearinghouse for stablecoins and how such an entity could fit in with Maker. He describes the idea\u2014codenamed ClearingDAO\u2014as \u201ca PSM-like interface that is a money-market in the background. You can, for instance, convert 1 DAI to 1 FEI and, in the background, MakerDAO issue a $1 loan to Tribe Protocol according to a bilateral agreement.\u201d ClearingDAO solves two problems:  It provides price equivalence to all major DeFi stablecoins ($1). It moves the supply/demand imbalance from the price to an interest rate stablecoins issuers will pay each other.  How does this relate to Maker?    Offloading growing Centralization risks to Maker and to DAI. Opening a general discussion   In short, it is similar to a D3M but with more features and a different profile. Like the D3M, it allows to delegate the investment part for non-strategic items to other players and focus on other strategic items. Moreover, it\u2019s safer in the sense of being an investment in a diversified portfolio with credit enhancement (but with an idiosyncratic smart-contract and governance risk). The huge value-add is that it is fully one chain. Investing in short-term bonds is off-chain, but the activity of other stablecoin issuers should be mainly on-chain. \u2026 An illustrative example is below where MakerDAO extends a loan to Fei Protocol with 2x the notional as FEI collateral.  \u2026 It fits well with MakerDAO as the decentral bank of DeFi as we will be a funding provider (of last resort and high rate during a crisis?).   Proposed parameters for offboarding TUSD-A @primoz of the Risk Core Unit published a list of proposed parameters for offboarding TUSD-A:  Enable liquidations Use Abacus/LinearDecrease -- tau [seconds]  Set liquidation penalty to 0 Set liquidation ratio to 150% Set buf to 1 Set ilk.hole to 5m Set tau to 21,600,000 second (est. 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0) Set tail to 432,000 seconds (5 days, implies a minimum price of 0.98)  cusp is not relevant, stays the same (tail will stop the auction) Set chip to 0 (no need to be fast) Set tip to 500 (bit higher value so that we guarantee kicking all vaults)  These changes will safely liquidate current open positions, taking user experience and protocol loss into account.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Implement Governance Mining Trial Signal Request Ends March 2nd In recent months, a decline in governance participation has been brought to light. Unfortunately, attracting engaged, informed voters is a problem that has largely gone unsolved. @GFXlabs believes it is time to take an actionable approach through a governance mining trial to help improve voting participation to compare polls treated with potential payments vs. polls before and after the treatment and the difference between treated/untreated and governance participation one year earlier. The initial trial is aimed at polls, with more straightforward metrics to monitor. The design of this trial includes an assurance payment of .1 MKR provided to any address that contributes \u2265 1 MKR in a non-abstain vote on at least one low-turnout poll. A maximum of .1 MKR may be awarded to any address for any individual closing date of this trial. All MKR rewards will be sourced from the MakerDAO treasury. A budget of 8 MKR will be reserved for this trial. This trial will be in effect until the MKR budget is exhausted or after six weeks, whichever occurs first. This design offers the potential for payouts without guaranteeing that MakerDAO will incur expenses and provide a meaningful reward to smallholders willing to provide a public good at their own expense. @GFXlabs agrees to take management of the reporting and administration of this trial. They will track and provide public updates on which addresses (if any) are eligible for assurance payments following the close of each trial date. @GFXlabs will provide a written report (via forum post) and oral report (if desired) on a Governance & Risk call after the close of the trial.  Pros:  Potentially increases governance participation, particularly among smaller holders Offers payments only when marginal increases in participation are needed Allows experimentation with a novel mechanism without committing to large or ongoing payments Trial will be administered by GFX Labs to avoid adding to the governance burden of core units    Cons:  Could incur a maximum expense of 8 MKR and 1000 DAI May not generate conclusive results If chosen to be extended or made permanent, this program would likely require an increased workload to administer on an ongoing basis Will require some measure of marketing/communication to make MKR holders aware of the trial program If the assurance payment amount of .1 MKR is too low to attract voters to polls, then rewards would accrue to those already voting rather than the marginal voter   @GFXlabs is asking the community whether MakerDAO should implement the Governance Mining Trial. Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot Signal Request Ends March 4th The Ambassador Program, which provides non-English-speaking communities with resources and educational materials, had its funding disrupted by the offboarding of MKT-001. @Kat took the initiative to spearhead the Program without the attachment of a Core Unit and is seeking 25,000 DAI to complete the pilot and associated projects over the next three months. She is asking the community whether MakerDAO should fund the Ambassador Pilot Program. Allocate 20M to Protocol-Owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP Signal Request Ends March 3rd In response to a recent discussion, @psychonaut believes the simplest method for improving MKR liquidity is to add protocol-owned Dai/MKR LP shares to UniV2. He asks the community whether Maker should allocate 20M to a protocol-owned UniV2 MKR/Dai LP and presents his argument that the pros outweigh the cons:  Pros:  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g. Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc.) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set it up and forget about it)  Cons:  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise large amounts of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is nearly the opposite of flop auctions    Bring Back the MKR Burn Part II Signal Request Ends March 4th @ultraschuppi states that the recent executive vote to temporarily disable Surplus Auctions and MKR burn had intentions to return to the original lerp mechanic. However, an on-chain poll added the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module. In response, Schuppi asks the community whether the protocol should return to the previous partial burning configuration as agreed in November, but with the following conditions:  The Rate Limiter has been installed on mainnet; this will take a couple of weeks. An initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set.

Links reflect my view of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.  A public PDF version of this post can be found here.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  A group of several members proposed an aggressive growth strategy to tackle the issue of decreased vault demand as the bull market subsides.  @cryptenthusiastic made an interesting proposal for decoupling Dai from the inflationary pressures brought on my fiat currencies. The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit presented the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard, a tool aiming to increase transparency and accountability while reducing information costs.    News and Announcements No Planned Executive - 2022-03-18 With nothing in the backlog and this week\u2019s polls not requiring immediate action, there is no planned executive proposal for this Friday. Financial Report - 2022-02 Overall Net Protocol Income was $4.8M, down 81% month on month and 27% year over year. Summary:    Financial Report - 2022-02    Recurring income decreased to $4.5M (-27% vs. a year ago) driven by a 34% decline in net interest income, offset by lower workforce expenses DAI risk ratios increased favorably on the back of an 11% reduction in risk-weighted assets ETH lending share declined 21% YoY vs. 3% increase in the supply of ETH. Aave and other protocols have been increasing supply at our expense with aggressive liquidity mining incentives Maker WBTC lending market share increased >300% YoY, well ahead of WBTC supply YoY increase of 110% Dai outstanding increased to $9.4bn, up 0.9% vs. the prior month     Aggressive Growth Strategy As the bull market subsides, vault demand decreases while Dai demand rises. Keeping the peg balanced requires onboarding an increasing amount of USDC, which does not bear interest, reducing protocol revenue and increasing centralized counterparty risk. The post\u2019s authors and contributors believe that the best way to approach this issue is by kicking the push toward real-world assets into high gear with a two-step approach.  Step one is raising capital by stopping the burn and shoring up a large surplus. This can be achieved both by issuing debt. The team proposes an insurance fund module to protect Maker from large individual loss events.  1709\u00d71400 165 KB  Step two involves taking on a more risk-on approach, thereby boosting revenues.

Content for the MakerDAO Twitter Account The Growth Core Unit will be managing two content calendars for the MakerDAO Twitter account: one internal calendar and one DAO-wide calendar with content from all the Core Units. The team has come up with four main types of communications:    Content for the MakerDAO Twitter Account    Discussions around the future of Maker and Dai: In the forum, there are engaging discussions about the future of Maker and Dai, although for a regular forum user, it\u2019s easy to understand, we want to aim for the inclusion of a broader audience by using Twitter to explain these discussions. We already published a thread explaining one of these discussions extracted from the forum. The next step is to thematize this type of recap. The Maker Community Update (Maker UpDaits): A general update about the state of MakerDAO, we will talk about governance, the protocol, and community matters. Initially, the recurrence will be bi-weekly to study its performance, and depending on the results, we could modify this event in the calendar. Wait for the first Maker UpDait next Monday! CU Updates (CU UpDaits): Monthly updates of the milestones achieved by the Core Units through their work within their specific MakerDAO vertical. We\u2019re hoping to publish the first version in April\u2019s first week to explain what happened in March. MakerDAO Announcements: We have the responsibility to update our users with changes occurring in Maker, such as collateral onboardings and offboardings, liquidation updates, and any other change that will have a direct impact on them. Also, Partnerships or special initiatives fall into this category.    The post also provides a step-by-step guide to preparing Tweets. [StarkNet] DAI Bridge and StarkNet Platform Technical Risk Assessment The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has put together a very thorough assessment of StarkNet and the potential risks involved with the StarkNet Dai bridge. So far, the implementation of the bridge has undergone an initial audit by ChainSecurity, with the final audit set to take place after the release of StarkNet 0.8.0. After giving an overview of the StarkNet zk-rollup platform and its platform risks, the post dives into the StarkNet Dai bridge implementation and its associated risks.  1040\u00d7640 102 KB  Topics include authorization, controlling the amount of bridged Dai, a deposit limit, upgradability, minting uncollateralized L2 Dai, censorship, and a lot more. Attention TUSD-A Users: Collateral Offboarding The TUSD-A vault type is being offboarded. Check out the relevant Signal Request for more details.    Attention TUSD-A Users: Collateral Offboarding   Method TLDR; The facility will have its liquidations turned on, Liquidation Penalty set to 0, and Liquidation Ratio adjusted 150%. This will enable all these vaults to be liquidated.  Enable liquidations for TUSD-A Use Abacus/LinearDecrease 1 Set Liquidation Penalty to 0 Set Liquidation Ratio 1 to 150% Set Auction Price Multiplier (buf) to 1 Set Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) to 5 million DAI Set tau for Abacus/LinearDecrease to 21,600,000 second (estimated 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0) Set Max Auction Duration (tail) to 432,000 seconds (5 days, implies minimum price of 0.98) Set Proportional Kick Incentive (chip) 1 to 0 Set Flat Kick Incentive (tip) to 500    Introducing the Ecosystem Performance API and Dashboard Objective In this post, The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit presented the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard, a tool that aims to:    Introducing the Ecosystem Performance API and Dashboard Objective    Increase transparency by allowing for ease of comparison across timeframes and highlighting work performed and delivered output Increase accountability by making the data provided by Core Units more accessible and easily understandable Reduce information costs by collating scattered information into more consumer-friendly formats    The full post dives into why we need a performance dashboard, the benefits of an API-first approach, and much more. The team hopes this tool will help \u201cincrease the level of transparency and quality control\u201d in the Maker organization as it grows in size and complexity. The Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001): CU Overview & Incubation Update Note: This core unit hasn\u2019t been ratified yet and is currently in the seedling phase of incubation by the SES core unit. The Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) wants to help Maker on its quest to become the central pillar of the DeFi monetary ecosystem by onboarding tens of billions of complex assets with use cases beyond trading. LOVE believes that a new approach to onboarding real-world assets needs to be developed so that the process can scale gracefully. This involves focusing on credit quality, scalability, structuring, and risk management. The team also believes that it\u2019s time to move toward 100 billion Dai. We\u2019ll need to ensure coordination, improve connectivity, move to scale, protect protocol resilience, and continue educating. This initiative will involve several Core Units. @williamr will help set up a lending incubator dedicated to scaling, accelerating, and further decentralizing all activities related to structured financing.  1346\u00d7686 202 KB  Introducing: RWF-001 Weekly Office Hours!

Active Discussions  Product Discussion: Maker Owned Fuse Pools and Maker Fuse D3M This post explores product ideas regarding Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse Protocol. The Risk Core Unit Team believes onboarding a Maker-owned Fuse Pool and implementing a D3M for that pool is an idea worth investigating. The post is broken down into four sections: \u201c(i) a brief introduction to Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse Protocol, (ii) examples of other stablecoin issuers that are currently involved in Fuse, (iii) how MakerDAO could potentially benefit from Fuse, and (iv) an overview of the suggested next steps.\u201d As the post puts it, \u201cRari Capital\u2019s Fuse Protocol allows the creation of lending pools, or money markets, with any combination of tokens for lending and borrowing.\u201d In contrast to the single-pool model, the Fuse Protocol isolates risk into siloed pools. Fuse can benefit Maker in several ways:    Product Discussion: Maker Owned Fuse Pools and Maker Fuse D3M   Possibility 1: Supporting Long-Tail Assets In the last few months, we have seen occurrences of collateral offboarding. There have been two main reasons for this. (i) The maintenance costs have outweighed the revenue produced. (ii) Certain collateral types have been too illiquid, which has increased the risk of the vaults. Fuse allows pool creators to choose between different third-party oracle providers. In practice, the fees associated with the oracle are subsidized as there are no recurring oracle costs. Fuse normally charges a 10% fee generated from the interest paid by borrowers. However, the key point is that, unlike Maker, no revenue threshold from stability fees is required to meet oracle costs. A Maker-owned Fuse pool would also allow MakerDAO to support low liquidity assets. The advantage of a Fuse pool is that creators have greater control of risk parameters. They can mitigate risk by setting supply caps, whitelisting certain addresses, and limiting particular collateral from being borrowed and only supplied. In summary, by adopting Fuse, Maker would have greater flexibility and choice in onboarding either new or previously offboarded collateral types that we would like to support but are currently not viable as vault collateral. Possibility 2: D3M - Full Control of Our Own Secondary Market The D3M is a very powerful tool. However, the exposure of the D3M is normally limited by the particular parameters and conditions of the associated lending market to which the DAI is being issued. This includes solvency and credit risk of the counter protocol. A D3M implementation to a Maker Fuse Pool would allow Maker to extend DAI minting rights to its lending market. By having full control of the market where DAI is issued via the D3M, Maker could eliminate certain counter protocol-related risks. However, other risks would still be involved, such as governance risk, smart contract risk, and competitive risks. Possibility 3: MKR as Collateral - Safety through Flexibility Fuse pools can be easily customized. This flexibility means that pools can support assets as collateral while disabling the same asset for borrowing. The usefulness of the MKR token would be increased if MakerDAO were to offer it as lending collateral in a Fuse pool to generate yield. By disabling borrowing of the MKR token, the risk of governance attacks or Emergency Shutdown (ES) attacks would be controlled. At present, MKR can be borrowed on Aave and Compound. This entails preexisting governance and ES attack risk. Maker could create a Fuse pool for MKR tokens and several acceptable stablecoins, including DAI and the ones currently held in PSMs. The governance and ES attack risks could be reduced if the incentives for depositing MKR on a Maker Fuse pool were higher than on Aave and Compound. A D3M should probably not be deployed to a pool where MKR is used as collateral to avoid collateralizing DAI with MKR tokens. Possibility 4: D3M - Scaling DAI by Supporting other Fuse Pools D3Ms can also be added to any other Fuse Pool that supports DAI. For example, Maker could implement a D3M to the FeiRari Pool 8 1 as it supports DAI for both borrowing and lending.   Anti-inflationary proposal In this post, @cryptenthusiastic proposes a way to decouple the value of Dai from the inflation factor of fiat currency in such a way that:    Anti-inflationary proposal    If the Dollar decreases, Dai would remain stable If the Fed succeeds in making the Dollar rise in value (which is difficult to maintain in the long run), Dai would rise along with the Dollar    @cryptenthusiastic argues that achieving this would lead to increased Dai adoption. Potential risks and disadvantages include:    Anti-inflationary proposal    Mild impermanent loss in Dai pairs with other stable currencies. Will probably slow down the adoption process in the short and medium-term; borrowers will be a bit less motivated to open a vault because of rising interest rates. It would be less attractive for users borrowing Dai to buy and increase their position in different cryptos (the solution to this may be option B below).    stkMKR: Maker Staking and Tokenomics Revision In this post, the Risk Core Unit describes a new economic token mechanism to supplement the existing buyback value accrual system. The new mechanism aims to preserve the gas and tax efficiency of the existing buy-and-burn mechanism while also addressing its drawbacks.    stkMKR: Maker Staking and Tokenomics Revision    Lack of targeted incentives - token economics can incentivize positive behavior within a protocol, but buyback and burn returns capital to all MKR holders equally and doesn\u2019t target incentives towards those token holders providing excess value Weak crypto narrative - buy and burn is out of favor, and an update could stoke greater interest in the Maker protocol; while in my opinion tokenomics should not be focused on price impacts, positive narrative shifts benefit the protocol by making MKR issuance for hiring, capital raising, and user incentivization more efficient Limited deterrence against governance attacks - Currently, it is possible for MKR owners to vote on a malicious proposal and then immediately withdraw funds and interact with DeFi protocols, which makes it nearly impossible to burn an attacker\u2019s stake (they could be commingled with lending or AMM exchange pools and contaminate funds held by other users)    The new mechanism, dubbed stkMKR, is inspired by Cosmos governance and the token economics of stkAAVE and xSUSHI. The process works as follows:    stkMKR: Maker Staking and Tokenomics Revision   A new token, stkMKR, will replace MKR as the core governance token of MakerDAO. stkMKR will be non-transferable and represents MKR staked in governance. Staked token-holders will receive a share of MKR tokens purchased through surplus auctions so that stkMKR will be backed by an increasing amount of MKR over time (automatically compounding like xSUSHI). Withdrawing from stkMKR requires waiting through a pre-set unbonding period, which improves protocol resilience and governance security (similar to Cosmos and stkAAVE). The figures below offer a high-level overview of the stkMKR mechanism.  Users can stake MKR in governance to receive stkMKR, representing their voting power and right to redeem a share of underlying MKR. stkMKR is held within voting contracts and can be freely delegated/redelegated across registered voting contracts with no delay or unbonding period.  A portion of MKR received through surplus auctions is diverted from burning to stkMKR holders. This could also be topped up manually by governance from the treasury or new minting. MKR is drip-fed into the pool overtime to smooth out yield volatility and support countercyclical yield increases if a large share of staked MKR is withdrawn. Rewards gradually increase the ratio of MKR per stkMKR.  Users must initiate withdrawal and then wait through a fixed unbonding period to withdraw funds. During this time, stkMKR is burned, and the corresponding MKR is transferred to an escrow, where it will no longer earn yield or have voting rights. After the unbonding period elapses, users can claim liquid MKR tokens from the escrow. Any additional withdrawal requests from the same address will overwrite the escrow unlock date, prolonging the unbonding period for any partially unbonded MKR. Alternatively, users can immediately re-stake their MKR back into stkMKR during the unbonding period (for example, if they want to vote on an important proposal).   Call for Responsible Budget and Process Delegate Doo Nam made a post calling for streamlining the budgeting process. While every budget modification request needs to be carefully examined, this has been difficult due to having too many budgets to review and cultural pushback against challenging budgets. Doo presents several suggestions for discussion:    Call for Responsible Budget and Process    Implement a hard freeze for an increase in a budget request for a long time frame  For example, once they have an approved budget, a Core Unit should not be allowed to ask for an increase in the budget request for at least six months or one year. While this might hinder some flexibility, it encourages Core Units to do more with less.  Limits the number of Budget Reviews per cycle  For example, we can set a cap, whether 1 or 2, instead of too many to allow the Maker community to fully discuss and examine the budget increase request. I believe the SES can also help by encouraging only a limited number of potential CUs to be presented.  Require or encourage the budget submissions to also provide market rates.  For example, what\u2019s the market rate for a potential new contributor\u2019s role? If it\u2019s a budget for a new service, how much would this service cost if it was a third-party professional company? Even major companies like Apple don\u2019t build everything by themselves as it\u2019s sometimes more efficient to use partners instead.  Rethinking the structure of Core Units.  Currently, Maker Core Unit is quite heavy with both budget and MKR vesting. There are many benefits to allowing a more flexible approach, especially with services that are more likely to be temporary.   RFC Budget request MIP - Break on-going from expansion budget requests. Budget Polling to RCV @MakerMan made another post providing some suggestions for dealing with budget requests.    RFC Budget request MIP - Break on-going from expansion budget requests. Budget Polling to RCV   I want to propose for discussion the following suggestions to help governance manage budgets.  All budget requests should break into \u2018on-going\u2019 costs for services provided, delineating these services and their associated costs. In these budget requests, a first shot analysis of what happens if funding for the CU ongoing request is cut to 95, 90, 80, 50, or 0% should be undertaken to provide governance information as to what happens to services the CU provides is cut. All CU \u2018expansions\u2019 to budget need to be a separate request including what new CU functions will be added, what including these will do to the \u2018ongoing budget\u2019 and implications, if any, for what we won\u2019t have if the budget expansion is rejected. Also, an analysis of what we get or extended timelines if this expansion is funded at 50,80,90,95%. Change polling on budget requests from yes/no on these to ranked-choice voting 100, 95, 90, 80, 50, 0 (a choice of 0 effectively being a no to this request).  Goals of these changes.  For both CUs and governance to get a sense of budgetary continuity Segregate budget expansions from ongoing expenses. Allow governance not to have to deny a total budget due to an unsatisfactory expansion component Allow governance the first shot at reducing budgets (50,0 would be extreme, but 95% not so much) Allows governance to adjust not just the total budget but also the total MKR vesting over the budgetary period - these should track anyway, so why not have them track in the budget process      Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Promote \u201cMIP4c3-SP1: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount\u201d to on-chain poll Psychonaut submitted a very straightforward Signal Requesting. At issue: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount 6 Considerations (not pros and cons):  Increase the payout for critical severity web bugs from 5k-50k to a single amount of 50k. Reduce negotiation around the critical severity bounty amount. Increase incentive for whitehat hackers to pursue Critical potential severity web bugs.  Onboard D3M For Notional Finance Recognized Delegate GFX Labs is signaling to onboard a D3M (DAI Direct Deposit Module) for Notional Finance\u2019s 3-month-maturity DAI lending pool 1, with an initial debt ceiling of 10 million DAI (unless recommended otherwise by Risk Core Unit).    [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance   Pros:  Increased revenues. The 3-month rate on Notional is north of 7%, on a base of around 85m DAI. For example, even a trial 10m DAI DC would firmly put a Notional D3M in the top 10 ilks by revenue. (10m DAI is currently estimated to suppress rates only to 6% as of writing)   For reference, estimated yearly revenue from other top ilks are below:   Increased control over the front end of the yield curve. Strategically, Maker\u2019s use of D3Ms across multiple lending venues will exert control over more of the total market, dampening effects of fragmented liquidity for DAI and volatility during market downturns. Being fairly insensitive to gas costs, Maker\u2019s D3M for Aave has allowed steady DAI rates even in intense volatility. That stabilization can also be applied to the very shortest portion of the yield curve. Diversification of counterparties. Maker currently faces existential risk from various counterparties: Circle, Lido, Bitgo, Paxos, and occasionally Aave. By growing DAI supply and increasing the rate by which the Surplus Buffer grows, a program of diverse D3Ms advances the goal of reducing excess reliance on individual counterparties. Familiar credit risks and technological risks. The risks represented by exposure to Notional\u2019s overcollateralized lending platform (listed under Cons) are risks that Maker has deep expertise in evaluating and monitoring through Collateral Engineering Services, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Units. Reduced reliance upon stablecoin collateral. The DAI supply is 68% backed by stable collateral, the bulk of which is 5,300,000,000 USDC and nearly 500,000,000 USDP. D3Ms can scale quickly and are limited only by the depth of their deployed markets, allowing them to grow as demand for DAI on the lending platform grows. This increases DAI supply, but it should also lower the demand for the PSMs, as there are alternative methods of obtaining DAI.   Cons:  Smart contract risk. There is always smart contract risk with any protocol-to-protocol interaction. Steps to mitigate this for Notional include an audit by ABDK, a $1,000,000 bug bounty program on Immunefi, analysis via Code4rena, formal verification via Certora, and a pending diligence report by Consensys. Multisig risk. Notional\u2019s governance mechanisms are still in the early stages of decentralizing. At the moment, key portions of the protocol are governed by a 3 of 5 multisig. No firm timeline is set, but the multi-sig\u2019s admin powers will be phased out over time. A possible mitigant of risk to Maker is that one of its delegates (GFX Labs) is one of the signatories, and all signatories are fully doxxed 1. Note that other underlying collaterals already in Maker\u2019s portfolio also include governances with multisigs, so this is not a novel form of risk. Illiquidity risk. If the amount of DAI in the liquidity pool drops due to LPs withdrawing their capital, there may be insufficient liquidity for Maker to withdraw 100% of its capital before maturity. It should be noted that Maker will always be able to withdraw its capital upon maturity regardless of the liquidity in the pool. This illiquidity risk only refers to withdrawals before maturity. A gradual scaling of maximum exposure can keep in mind to mitigate this. Capital loss risk. If liquidations do not perform properly, capital loss is risk. Notional has built a robust liquidation infrastructure 1 and currently utilizes conservative parameters. Being an overcollateralized lending platform, the risk of bad debt stemming from default is, in principle, low. While probably unnecessary for Maker, there is also coverage available for Notional under Nexus Mutual. Oracle risk. Notional utilizes Chainlink oracles for the four listed assets. Maker is already exposed to Chainlink oracles via Aave and (soon) Compound.    Onboard PAXG Another Signal Request for new collateral onboarding was posted by the Strategic Finance Core unit, this time for onboarding PAXG (PAX Gold).    [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG   Pros  Gold might be an important building block for DeFi. When we onboarded WBTC, it was small and unproven in DeFi; since then, it has been an important piece, thanks to MakerDAO. The same thing can happen with PAXG. DeFi can provide yield for gold and attract TradFi people This onboarding might increase our relationship with Paxos. US Dollar dominance is under attack (especially after the weaponization of the dollar), and strong inflation is on the menu. Both are good for gold.  Cons  Gold can fall into oblivion soon. The current rates increase are bad for gold. PAXG is centralized by Paxos Demand can be lacking, and we would incur a loss and a defocus (Oracle costs)      Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Links reflect my view of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories right now. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or a pm.  A public PDF version of this post can be found here.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  There will be no executive vote on-chain until February 25th, 2022.  Check out January\u2019s Financial Report of MakerDAO! Click here to enter the 10B Dai meme competition to win a one-of-a-kind NFT.    ICYMI - Announcements Planned Executive Proposal Update Yesterday, February 8th, the mandated actors discussed upcoming executives. In the interest of providing transparency and sync expectations, @prose11 announced that the discussion resulted in postponing an executive vote for the next two weeks. February 11, 2021 Executive: This week, only one item needs an executive vote: TUSD-A Offloading, which may require additional domain work prior to the executive. In order to efficiently save resources for a full executive, this week\u2019s votes will be bundled with the next executive on February 25th, 2022. February 18, 2021 Executive: This is the week of ETHDenver, and many Core Units and delegates will be involved in the event. All non-urgent votes will be bundled into the following week\u2019s, February 25th, executive vote, including TUSD-A Offloading. GovAlpha will be running non-executive polls as usual. There should be plenty of items to bundle when executive proposals resume on February 25th. Reach out to GovAlpha for any inquiries or concerns. Financial Report - 2022-01 The Strategic Finance Core Unit brings us January\u2019s Financial Report showing a decreased demand in lending driven by recent market conditions, leading to lower stability fees and recurring income. Check out the original post for their entire slide deck; but here are some key points:  Net protocol income is up 121% MoM, driven by an 869% ($16.3M) increase in net liquidation income. Net interest income is up 312% YoY. Recurring income increased to $7.9M (+216% vs. PY). Both Dai risk and liquidity ratios increased favorably. ETH lending market share increased 2.6% MoM. WBTC lending market share increased 0.4% MoM. Dai outstanding grew from $9.1 to $9.35B over the past month, a 2.7% increase!  Makerburn\u2019s 10B DAI NFT meme competition We did it! The Dai total supply surpassed 10 billion!   For this special occasion, @makerburn announces the opportunity to win an exclusive one-of-a-kind NFT, commemorating the 10B DAI Makerburn moment. Throughout the next two weeks, everyone is invited to submit their best meme accompanying this glorious moment, and multiple entries per user are allowed (unless you spam). The meme with the most likes will claim victory and ownership to the NFT. Good luck! The competition closed on 2022-02-22T16:00:00Z Misleading Sentence Summary on Live Poll the Signal Request to bring back the MKR burn passed and went on-chain to Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper, which is live until February 10th. However, due to a misleading summary noted in the body of the poll that @Primoz pointed out, @prose11 submits a post to help clarify that this vote is in reference to the technical implementation of a Rate Limiter, which will have no immediate bearing on the MKR burn rate. Polls cannot be taken down or modified once posted; please share this announcement with any known MKR voters. GovAlpha and @ultraschuppi discussed how to move forward with the poll\u2019s results, which led to the [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Part II mentioned in more detail below. Rate Limited Flapper A recent discussion and Signal Request expressed that majority of the community would like to introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper to continue MKR burn, which went on-chain and ends Today, February 10th, at 4 PM UTC. The @Protocol-Engineering Core Unit published more details on the Rate Limited Flapper.  This is a simple amendment that allows Governance to limit the amount of DAI that is allowed to be auctioned off at once, accomplished by adding the following two new parameters to the flapper contract; lid and fill.   lid is the total value of dai allowed to be sent out to auction at once.  fill is the current amount of dai that is currently in auction. calling kick() increases fill. calling deal() decreases fill.   Keepers must update their logic to deal() finished prior auctions to clear out space for the new kick(). The next steps involve an additional signal request determining the correct DAI limited to be auctioned off at once. Solutions have already been written by @hexonaut, which will undergo an audit before implementation and successfully passing its on-chain poll.  Looking for more posts and updates?

You are 100% wrong, and here is why\u2026\u2019 Grant Announcement: KYC/AML Compliance Research The @SES-Core-Unit welcomes Patrizia Crespi and announces a research grant to study the potential impact of upcoming regulations on the Maker protocol, in particular know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations. In the report, she will analyze potential KYC and AML sanction risks and propose regulatory risk mitigation strategies. The grant\u2019s objective is to foster Maker\u2019s core values and protect contributors and governors. This research should help serve as a point of contact for external compliance relations and inquiries for MakerDAO. In addition, @SES-Core-Unit will restructure their Incubator and Grants Program, allowing incubation of up to five candidate facilitators per educational track providing the ability to focus on 10-15 facilitators to run individual Core Units across three educational tracks. Patrizia Crespi will help ensure these legal incubation tracks meet appropriate legal infrastructure. The grant will continue into March 2022 with the delivery of a final report reviewing the research results. Please, check out the Governance and Risk Call #178 (coming soon!) for a deeper discussion about this grant.  960\u00d7540 136 KB   960\u00d7540 136 KB  Framing The Debate on Market Liquidity - Part One - Funding There have been previous discussion on improving Dai and MKR liquidity, which is still open for ideas and continued discussion. @LongForWisdom submits a post to help the community understand the costs, benefits, and options available across on-chain and off-chain trading venues. Three significant decisions must be addressed before implementing actionable steps towards a consistent and effective market liquidity strategy for Dai and/or MKR:  Decision 1: How does MakerDAO fund its liquidity strategy? Decision 2: What is our liquidity strategy aiming to achieve, and how? Decision 3: What tools/methods do we use to implement our liquidity strategy?  This post speaks on Decision 1 and provides four methods for funding a liquidity strategy, which may require implementation methods addressed in upcoming posts. Method 1: Mint Dai directly and use it to purchase liquidity in some form, which can be used to back the minted DAI. Check out associated pros and cons in the original post. Method 2: Use Dai in the Surplus Buffer to only purchase liquidity. Check out associated pros and cons in the original post. Method 3: Sell MKR that\u2019s either minted or in the treasury to use and buy Dai or other liquidity components. Check out associated pros and cons in the original post. Method 4: Lock MKR that\u2019s either minted or in the treasury into a secondary lending platform and borrow Dai against that locked MKR. Check out associated pros and cons in the original post. @LongForWisdom will publish additional posts covering Decisions 2 and 3.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Advance \u201cRapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties\u201d to on-chain poll Signal Ends February 11th @psychonaut submits a signal request asking the community whether we should push MIP4c3-SP1: Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) towards an on-chain poll. MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp Signal Request Ends February 18th The Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier poll passed, which led to compensation calculation changes for December. However, one delegate, @MakerMan, received no compensation for November and would have received 8,245 DAI if the new compensation model had been in place. In response to this event, @prose11 submits a signal request asking the community whether the protocol should pay MakerMan the 8,245 DAI for his Recognized Delegate duties in November, calculated based on the December formula change. Allocate 20M to protocol owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP Signal Request Ends March 3rd In response to recent discussion on MKR liquidity, @psychonaut believes the simplest method is to add protocol-owned Dai/MKR LP shares to UniV2. He asks the community whether Maker should allocate 20M to a protocol owned UniV2 MKR/Dai LP and exhibits that the pros outweigh the cons:  Pros:  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g., Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc.) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set up and forget about it)  Cons:  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise lots of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is practically opposite to flop auctions    Bring back the MKR burn Part II Signal Request Ends March 4th @ultraschuppi states that the recent executive to temporarily disable Surplus Auctions and MKR burn had intentions to return to the original lerp mechanic. However, an on-chain poll added the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module. In response, Schuppi asks the community whether the protocol should return to the previous partial burning configuration as agreed in November but only if the following are met:  The Rate Limiter has been installed in the mainnet - this will take a couple of weeks. An initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set.    Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.
