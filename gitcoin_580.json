Previously there hasn\u2019t been an easy way to gauge their level of engagement within the DAO. The Steward Report Cards aims to solve this problem by providing the most valuable metrics of each steward and improve the transparency and accountability of their work. The cards may function as a tool to assist delegators making informed decisions and to allow stewards to compare their involvement relative to their peers. Public data of each stewards involvement in discourse, workstreams and governance participation are presented and combined to calculate an overall health-score. The titles on the card are clickable and will respectfully route the user to the data source with more info. A quick walk through of the cards   Steward since: This is the date that the Steward introduced themselves on the governance forum. The earliest date is the launch of Gitcoin DAO, 25th of may 2021. Link goes to the Stewards introduction post on the forum.   Forum posts: The number of comments and threads started on the governance forum. Link goes to the Stewards profile on the forum.   Workstream: Involvement in any of the Workstreams of Gitcoin DAO according to the public information of the governance forum and on Notion. Link goes to gitcoindao.com   Voting weight: The percentage of governance tokens delegated to the Steward in relation to the total number of tokens. Link goes to the stewards GitcoinDAO-profile on Tally.   Vote participation: This value displays the percentage of proposals Snapshot the Steward has participated in. Non-serious proposals on Snapshot are not taken into consideration. As of writing this post, participation in 20 out of 25 proposals are required to achieve a 100% score. On-chain voting on proposals via Tally are not displayed on the cards but are taken into consideration in the health-score calculation, more on this below. Link goes to the GitcoinDAO-page on Snapshot.   Health: The metrics described above are combined into an overall health-score, displayed in the top right corner of the card. The current formula for calculating the health of a Steward is based on three sub-scores; Forum-score (F), Voting-score (V) and Workstream-score (W):   F = 1.75 * Posts/Weeks as Steward (the maximum forum score is set to 1.5)   V = (2.2 * S + 1.5 * T) / 2 where; S = Snapshot participation T = Tally participation   W = Lead Stewards of a Workstream gives 5 points. Workstream contributor gives 3 points.   These are combined to achieve an over-all health-score:  Health = F * V + W  (We are exploring additional ways to represent Steward involvement in Workstreams and DAO-wide initiatives.)   [Statement]: Link to the stewards introduction post on the forum.   [Delegate]: Link to the stewards GitcoinDAO-profile on Tally with an option to delegate GTC.   The search field at the top of the site allows the user to quickly find a specific steward or group of stewards. It is also possible to link to a specific card, or a group of cards, by utilizing the search function. As you search the URL-bar auto-updates with the shareable link. For example:  https://www.daostewards.xyz/#search=public will display all stewards in the Public Goods Funding-workstream. We are continuously working on improving the cards are looking forward to receive feedback! Signed, @Fred, @seedphrase and the rest of the MMM-Workstream  ",

Voting weight is calculated as the percentage of tokens delegated in relation to the total amount of tokens, as opposed to the amount of tokens in governance.

After some iterations we ended up with the formula presented in the OP. This formula takes into account all of the currently tracked metrics and the results it produces are aligned with how we understand Steward participation so far. We are finalizing the specifications for v2.0 which we aim to ship this quarter with added features and metrics developed alongside the new Steward Council initiative. An important aspect of the new version is to make sure the site does not turn into a dystopian surveillance tool like @kelsien touched upon above by only showing relevant metrics i.e. score per season/quarter or similar. We also don\u2019t want to penalize a Steward or hinder their health score forever due to periods of low engagement whether it be other obligations, health reasons or similar.  We\u2019re looking into how Stewards can potentially own their cards and personalize them with social media links and other customization options. ",

I\u2019d encourage other large holders of tokens to publish similar reports too. Maybe in leiu of that, someone would be able to issue a report on who is delegating to who using on-chain metrics? I\u2019d like to treating this initial delegation as an invitation for conversation.
