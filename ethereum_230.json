I am doing an hour and a half workshop on governance at EthBerlin and wanted to see if anyone from Magicians would be there that would want to spend some time talking about it or participate in the Q&A. If you all think of someone who would be good for that role and is attending EthBerlin please let me know!  Also, this is a good opportunity to gather interest around the various emerging Rings, if you are attending a relevant talk you might ask the presenter to mention your working group. ",
