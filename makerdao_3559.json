                    "content": "Hi All, I wanted to bring up a small but critical task as the Foundation continues on its path to dissolution and the community towards full decentralization. As of today, May 3 2021, the Foundation has transfered technical ownership of the redeemer contract to Maker Governance. Until today, the Foundation\u2019s multisig owned the redeemer contract. The redeemer contract holds a remaining 19,587 MKR that permits addresses to swap their old MKR for new MKR. This redemption process is possible via the makerdao.com/redeem page. This page was created in 2017 in preparation for the launch of Single-collateral Dai. Please note that this does not change the current mechanics for users who wish to redeem - that process remains the same and interested parties may visit https://makerdao.com/redeem/. What do you have to do  Nothing; to verify the statements above, one may verify Governance ownership of the redeemer by checking check the \u201cMCD_PAUSE_PROXY\u201d (0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB).

Despite the initial redemption beginning several years ago this contract still processes redemptions pretty frequently. ",
