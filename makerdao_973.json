Join us 2022-04-26T15:00:00Z as we host Jordan Sutcliffe @Jstar from Stakewise DAO to lead a discussion on sETH2 and the value of onboarding this collateral type.  Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by StakeWise DAO\u2019s Jordan Sutcliffe @jstar. Community Q&A.   Vote Here  [Community Greenlight Poll] sETH2 (Stakewise Staked ETH)   [MIP6 Application] sETH2 (Stakewise Staked ETH)   StakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain. ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users\u2019 interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2). sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise\u2019s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts like an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH, providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.   When Time in your local-timezone format: 2022-04-26T15:00:00Z Mark it on your Google Calendar!

I am Retro from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU. I am joined by our facilitator Juan. Today we have Jordan Sutcliffe from StakeWise DAO to talk about a new collateral that is being proposed for onboarding into our ecosystem. Stakewise is a tokenized staking pool whose interest-bearing token is sETH2. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.    StakeWise sETH2  [sETH2] Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6)   Jordan Sutcliffe  Presentation 00:49  StakeWise - Liquid ETH2 Staking1737\u00d7980 72.3 KB   Who we are1738\u00d7981 163 KB   Dual Token Model1737\u00d7979 160 KB   Staking Infrastructure1738\u00d7979 136 KB   Liquidity1736\u00d7979 135 KB   Considerations1737\u00d7977 127 KB   sETH2 on Maker1738\u00d7981 68.1 KB   Discussion 17:51 - Frank: I saw a slide at an EthDenver presentation comparing all the StakedETH providers, and StakeWise had 90%+ of Prysm Usage. When did you reduce it to 50/50? How difficult was it to reduce the Prysm Usage without incurring slashing? Why most taking facilities are so dependent on Prysm? 20:26 - Retro: How is the DAO preparing for the merge? Are there any other challenges you could anticipate, or do you see it going smoothly? 21:58 - Juan: How big is the DAO? To have an idea of how that would be a potential surface attack in terms of vulnerabilities. 24:43 - Juan: Do you have any ideal risk parameters to get this started? Do you have any idea of the debt ceiling or the stability fee you would like?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 26:16  The voting for this Collateral Onboarding is in progress. There are about six days left, and we already have a strong vote of confidence from the community. Jordan is available in the forums as @Jstar. I appreciate everybody\u2019s attendance today. Thank you, Jordan. It was great having you!   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @Gala produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
