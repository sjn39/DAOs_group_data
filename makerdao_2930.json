                    "content": "Hey all, dust parameter is the minimum possible debt of a vault. Currently all vault types have 100 DAI dust value. The last time governance increased dust from 20 DAI to 100 DAI was in mid August when gas prices started to rise due to the liquidity mining craze. We saw how gas price increased over 200 Gwei on Black Thursday and even above 700 Gwei during the summer due to hype around yield farming opportunities. @monet-supply made this really nice table a while ago, which shows what is the minimum debt (dust) size tolerated if gas price increases and we want auctions to clear without a loss for Maker. For instance, when liquidating a 150% collateralized position in a distressed scenario where gas price increases to 500 Gwei, auction costs (kick, tend, dent, deal, trade) for keepers amount to about $160 of gas fees. This means the debt size (or dust) can not be below 323 DAI in case the keeper makes such a transaction with zero profit or loss and no loss is made for Maker. If you assume about 10% profit for the keeper, minimum tolerated debt size already increases to 462 DAI. Also note that unwinding of a vault costs approximately 400k gas which again, in extreme events of gas price around 500 Gwei, costs can amount to $90. We propose governance to increase dust above current 100 DAI level due to concerns mentioned above. There are also other negative effects that low dust levels may cause, particularly related to keepers\u2019 reduced incentive to bite smaller vaults. The fixed gas costs compared to small dusty positions they bid on might outweigh their expectation of profits in a competitive bidding strategy that takes 6 hours. The question of course is what amount of dust is still tolerated by governance, since we know increasing dust has downsides related to excluding part of retail users. Furthermore, according to our knowledge other platforms such as Compound and Aave don\u2019t use dust equivalent debt limits. Few reference data points:  There are currently around 1.700 Vaults opened having debt less than 500 DAI, which sums up to 180.000 DAI in total. Some of them might be abandoned. There are currently around 2.000 Vaults opened having debt less than 1000 DAI, which sums up to 400.000 DAI in total. Some of them might be abandoned.  What should be the new dust level?     100 DAI (no change) 250 DAI 500 DAI 750 DAI 1000 DAI Abstain     0 voters     This poll will close on Sunday 15th November. ",

Now, back to the current issue - we cannot make an educated answer unless the risk team provides the expected gas fees for the next 1 month. Today, the \u201cnormal\u201d gas price is 45-60 Gwei. IMO, the liquidations should be profitable with 150 Gwei gas price which could happen anytime and for a prolonged period of time.

Nobody can reliably forecast gas prices during liquidation events. They are definitely higher during liquidation events than what you observe on average. But imagine having some intense farming going on and at the same time crypto crashing. Also DeFi is growing and protocols are becoming more and more interdependent. ",

Since we are moving to a dutch auction system for liquidations, there is no longer an inherent incentive for keepers to trigger auctions. To combat this, we are introducing two new governance params that will be configureable for each collateral type: uint256 chip;  // Percentage of due to suck from vow to incentivize keepers uint256 tip;   // Flat fee to suck from vow to incentivize keepers  When bark() is called by a keeper to trigger a liquidation, tip + due * chip amount of DAI is printed and given to the keeper as an incentive, where due is the amount out for liquidation before the liquidation penalty is accounted for. This allows for a good degree of flexibility for incentivizing keepers:  If chip is set to zero, it is just a flat fee. If tip is set to zero, it is just a linear increase with vault size.  tip can be configured to be above dust in extreme scenarios where the protocol is willing to incentivize liquidations at a loss.  Regarding gas, I just compared gas used by the current LIQ-1.2 bite() vs. the upcoming LIQ-2.0 bark(): bark() gas used: 360644 bite() gas used: 343711 difference:       16933  bark() currently does use slightly more gas than bite(), but because of the explicit incentive from the protocol, that should not cause any issues. We also must note that LIQ-2.0 is still a work in progress so this number could change. ",
