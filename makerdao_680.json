As a part of the mandate refresh, we restructured our public drive\u2019s 02 | Programs folder and created program roadmap charts for all of our programs. You can see a .png image of each within their respective folders.  646\u00d7788 49.3 KB   Budget Expansion A budget modification proposal will be coming from us around the first week of March. Expect:  Increase in part-time Contributor funding needs by 2x. Increase in full-time compensation needs, forecasting a potential new hire in Q3-Q4 and raises to existing employee salaries. Other house-keeping modifications, outlined in [column L of our public budget sheet\u2019s Monthly Budget View.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H41VHDwZDlF9CSAlbR-u5NBUhp1qwTcaSGNkYB5C5bI/edit#gid=82177123&range=L:L     Contributor needs A couple of people have reached out and several referrals have been sent our way. Thank you for hearing our needs! We are in the process of onboarding at least one individual, with more to come.  MakerDAO.World acquisition We\u2019ve come to an agreement with the former MKT-001 facilitator to acquire the makerdao.world domain and associated gsuite account for 500 Dai. We have no intention to use the domain for any active projects, feel free to reach out to us if you\u2019re interested. We acquired these assets to take ownership of the @makerdao.world email server which our team uses.  ETHDenver Our team is set to be there from February 16th - 20th. We are collaborating with various MakerDAO folks on a shared resource to track events, talks, people, and other resources. Our trip overview document outlines our team and individual goals for the trip.  COM-001 Feedback Survey Our team set up a Governance Communications Happiness Feedback Survey with the objective to help us receive feedback on your experience with our communication, relevance, timeliness, transparency, collaboration, inclusiveness, and integrity as a Core Unit.  Program Updates  Weekly Relay We are onboarding a new contributor to help us with production.  State of Dai We are considering ways to expand coverage to vault user behavior analysis. If you are interested in contributing to this, reach out to @Artem_Gordon.  Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance now contains greater detail for the descriptions of each post. This has increased the amount of time needed for each release, and has resulted in late publishing times these past two weeks. Artem has shifted his workflow to make sure it is published on time before Thursday\u2019s Governance and Risk call.  Monthly & Annual Governance Review January\u2019s issue came out Friday, February 4th.  Monthly Core Unit Updates January\u2019s issue came out Monday, February 7th. Artem_Gordon erroneously missed the Risk team update, and made the fix to include them.  Initiatives Tracking, Reporting, & Stakeholder Alignment Calls COM-001 acts as the coordinator for the CMON, CMOFF, and SEC initiative Stakeholder Alignment calls. Over the last two weeks these three initiatives have been moved from the Work Breakdown phase into a Production Coordination phase which will help streamline the tracking of deliverables and milestone progress within these initiatives. We will be presenting updates once per month per initiative until we have the capacity to move to a bi-monthly update schedule.  Public Calendars No major updates here. Calls Votes & Important Dates  Stakeholder Database We are continuing to work with TechGDPR to bring this project into a state of GDPR compliance.  Issue Discussion Calls On February 9th, Thomas Flitter hosted our monthly issue discussion call where we explored the facilitator and core unit offboarding process. Check out the video below        Emergency Playbook We reviewed a new Incident Response Roles document created by the IS-001 team and are in the process of building it into the Emergency Playbook and creating a Incident Role Assignments Tracker which we will soon do outreach to populate.  Press Relations Support We spoke to several people on the topic this week and will be moving forward with expanding our scope in this program. Assuming our mandate renewal and upcoming budget modification passes in April, we will be clear to start hiring for a full-time Public Relations PM in May 2022.

We are in the process of creating incident roles and a tracker so that Core Units can assign their team members to these roles. This along with more complete resource sets for various emergency types is on our backlog. Unfortunately my bandwidth has been quite full, so progress has been slow and steady as I balance my other responsibilities. This is part of the reason we are proposing another hire.
