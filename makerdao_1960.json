                    "content": "I would like to open discussion on what the DAO views to be \u201cexistential exposure\u201d because I think this term gets thrown around a lot incorrectly (myself included). This is especially important now as we now have RWAs in excess of the surplus buffer. Ideally we should arrive at some threshold with which single asset exposure moves from being \u201creally bad\u201d to \u201cexistential\u201d. Furthermore I would like to discuss possible mitigation strategies for large loss events. First let\u2019s define \u201cexistential exposure\u201d. To me this means we take on bad debt to such a degree that DAI permanently loses its peg in an irrecoverable way. This does not include temporary loss of peg, but it\u2019s a little subjective when this becomes permanent or not. I think we can bucket losses into three categories:  Loss <= Surplus Buffer Surplus Buffer < Loss <= Existential Threshold Loss > Existential Threshold  In the first category we are completely safe as we can absorb the loss entirely by the surplus buffer. Obviously if we lose all our equity this is not great, but the protocol will likely survive. The second category is the space where I feel we haven\u2019t thought about enough. Currently the strategy here is to almost immediately mint MKR to cover the hole, but I believe this may be sub-optimal especially in a bear market. It would be a shame if the protocol could have survived a loss of this size, but we hyper-inflate MKR and blow up the protocol by default. So what is the alternative? I suggest we consider having some tolerance for temporary under-collateralization. Obviously we can\u2019t go crazy, but something like 10% of outstanding DAI supply could probably work. This would allow for a loss of 645m at current numbers (10% of 5.7b supply + Surplus Buffer). I believe if we took a loss of this size in the current system it would cause massive inflation in MKR supply due to illiquidity, and this would be catastrophic to the stability of the protocol. But MKR inflation is not the only backstop. In the worst case scenario we can always trigger emergency shutdown to give everyone what they are owed with the 10% haircut. This is pretty extreme though. I\u2019d like to come up with a middle-ground solution. Specifically I think if the loss (minus SB) is less than 10% of outstanding DAI supply we do not immediately issue MKR, but instead just leave the bad debt on the books and work to gradually recapitalize over time. This can be done through issuing MKR tokens (slowly), debt or maybe tighten up expenses and wait for revenue to refill the hole. This really isn\u2019t that crazy. Frax routinely operates at a 10-20% under-collateralization and they trade at $1 just fine. Same with MIM. They managed to incur 10% in bad debt (8.6m) and are just leaving it there. Peg is still at ~$1. To be clear I\u2019m not recommending we turn into FRAX. I think this should be treated as a crisis which we work to remedy asap. One issue we create with leaving a sizable hole in the balance sheet is that a bank run becomes possible, and we are not currently set up to deter this. In particular the PSM redemption of always 1:1 is problematic as it encourages a race to redeem at $1. Once the liquidity runs out the remaining DAI users may get close to $0 for their DAI. This is not great. I think we can do better. I would like to investigate adding a redemption curve to the PSMs such that the tout parameter increases during panic sell off events. I don\u2019t think this needs to be super complicated. We can give some \u201cnormal\u201d 1:1 amount every day and any abnormal redemptions above that cause an IAM to kick in and start raising the tout. Having a redemption curve does two things we want.  It deters people from panicking. If we have a 10% hole in the balance sheet then DAI holders can be fairly confident they will recover at least 90% of their value vs the current situation where ~0% is a real possibility in a full bank run scenario. This will improve confidence in the system as we can establish a market price for DAI below $1. People who panic pay fees into the surplus buffer to recapitalize the system. An equilibrium will be reached where those who have lost confidence and are okay with recovering say 95% of their value will pay the 5% to those who stay.  If we want to proceed with this @Protocol-Engineering can investigate a mechanism to tack this onto the existing system (or maybe we want to upgrade the PSMs). Here is what a sample curve could look like:  psm-redemptions2183\u00d71511 81.2 KB  As we venture into new territory with 4 RWAs now having 500m+ exposure, I think it\u2019s important to start being explicit about what amount we think we can survive and within that limit improve the resiliency of the system. Establishing this threshold will make it so we conscientiously move beyond the survivable loss limit instead of just picking nice round numbers. We likely want to limit existential loss exposure to be 1 or fewer. If we establish a threshold of say 10% then we would need to decide to move say MIP65 or GUSD from survivable to 1b if we want to scale it up. ",

It\u2019s hard to mitigate risks that are not clearly identified.     hexonaut:  This really isn\u2019t that crazy. Frax routinely operates at a 10-20% under-collateralization and they trade at $1 just fine.   Just a quick note here that FRAX is (as of writing) less than 7% uncollateralized and arguably more fully reserved (but less collateralized) than DAI. They have also been steadily reducing the uncollateralized portion of their float for the last 12 months, with a stated goal of no longer having unbacked FRAX.     hexonaut:  I would like to investigate adding a redemption curve to the PSMs such that the tout parameter increases during panic sell off events. I don\u2019t think this needs to be super complicated. We can give some \u201cnormal\u201d 1:1 amount every day and any abnormal redemptions above that cause an IAM to kick in and start raising the tout.   This is an interesting idea, but DAI\u2019s main advantage to users (and in this particular instance, to regulators) has been its lack of capital controls. This would mark a fairly substantial policy shift and should be considered very carefully.     hexonaut:  As we venture into new territory with 4 RWAs now having 500m+ exposure   Note that this is not the only list of things capable of \u201cone-hit kills\u201d on Maker. Expanding the list to include both indirect financial exposure and political exposure for today would include: Centre Consortium (USDC) Gemini (GUSD) Paxos (USDP) Coinbase (MKR custodied there is easily enough to control the protocol if seized) Silvergate/Signature/State Street (Custodians of both USDP and GUSD reserves) Blackrock (Custodian of USDC reserves) Monetalis HVBC (soon to be Citizens Financial Services) The list should also likely include various infrastructure that can also be co-opted to break Maker beyond repair. Once all the existential exposure is identified, then they can be sorted into buckets of higher or lower relative probability, and then mitigations considered. Thank you again for beginning this conversation. ",

I would agree that having a redemption price that can fluctuate is good. Nevertheless, in my view, the redemption price should be min($1, asset/liabilities). This is prone to front-run so having some curve as you mention could be an addition. Moreover, having proper on-chain accounting is quite challenging with off-chain stuff, we might want to wait for a migration to 100 on-chain and liquid. I personally don\u2019t like the \u201cwe can be insolvent but all is fine\u201d. While I was in the view to have no exposure above the surplus buffer at some point, reality is that it is impossible. We need to indeed list major counterparties, exit the riskest one, and improve the one we can\u2019t. ",

With some of the RWAs MakerDAO is onboarding, defending the peg may require selling RWAs at a significant loss. It would make more sense to allow the peg to float and wait out the maturity of those assets. As we start getting consistent revenue from RWAs, it is worth considering enabling the DSR and accept that if the USDC in the PSM gets drained then we may just allow Dai to freefloat. ",
