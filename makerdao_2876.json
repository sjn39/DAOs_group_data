Collateral factors: Aave: 80% Compound: 75% Maker: 66.67% Interest rates: Compound: 0% Maker: 2% Aave: ~5% If I\u2019m going to draw debt on my ETH, why would I choose Maker over Compound or Aave? Maker has the lowest liquidation threshold and does not have the lowest interest rate. I understand interest rates will normalize on Compound with time, but let\u2019s say we remove interest rate from the discussion. The collateralization factor is very important. No rational actor would draw debt close to their liquidation point to begin with, but the larger the buffer the better. Maker is non-competitive in that sense. I understand stability of the protocol is important, but trust is growing on Compound and Aave and I believe they are safe enough. Even in a March 12 situation I imagine they\u2019d be okay (but maybe not). Maker being the trusted protocol for RWA would be a great reason to be conservative. But how is Maker going to compete in the cryptoasset realm? Where is the competitive advantage going to come from in the future? I don\u2019t even fully understand why TVL is growing so rapidly to begin with. Clearly the yields for DAI are going to be on par with other stablecoins in the future, so that isn\u2019t something to rely on. Just trying to gain a better understanding of DAI growth and the vision for the future. Thanks. ",

OP is also right about collateral factors, in other platforms the liquidation price is lower, it offers more safety buffer there. I really like Maker, but when coming to the above point I do see Maker losing out. The good thing about Maker is it is still the most secure (in my opinion) and decentralised. But with time, other platforms are going to be more battle-tested and getting more robust. Can Maker stands out then? ",

But Maker has taken the lead by making all MKR holders be in all cases guaranteeing the solvency of the system. In times of substantial DSR this will attract many participants. There is research from the legacy world on how CDS issuers reduce cost of capital for borrowers. ",

We are going in the wrong direction there by catering to whales (which are still not interested) instead on concentrating on regular users who want a safe loan and a stable DAI.   We are lowering the stability fee down from 6% to 4%. The product is also very new. Give it a chance. It seems like a very narrow view to be opposed to an offering because it hasn\u2019t gained traction right away. An additional offering for the most widely used collateral in the Ethereum ecosystem that is on par with industry standards sounds like not only a good move but a mandatory one. A higher collateral factor caters to all users. Also you can\u2019t target regular users while having the worst UX in the lending/borrowing space. Aave and Compound have a significantly superior UX than Maker. Firstly, going to makerdao.com and having to navigate to Products > Oasis > Borrow DAI is unnecessary friction. There should be an additional frontend that deals directly with the borrowing app. It should be on a different domain name so we can have both options. Then you have a list of collateral types. None of them just say the collateral type. They all have \u201c-A\u201d or \u201c-B\u201d next to them. That\u2019s not good from a UX perspective. There are no images of the coin logos. The \u201cLIQ RATIO\u201d is not the industry standard way of displaying the liquidation threshold. Most protocols use \u201ccollateral factor\u201d instead. If you want to target \u201cregular users\u201d then you should have a UX that caters to regular users. I think this is an important upgrade that needs to be made. What forum category can I post this suggestion in? Are there any existing proposals/posts that discuss frontend design? ",

As of now I think getting to the vault creation UI is higher friction than ever after the new updates to the makerdao.com website. I have to navigate to makerdao.com > Use Dai > Open a Maker Vault > Connect wallet page. When the change was originally made, it took me a few minutes to get to the vault page. If a power user such as myself is having difficulty, I can only imagine what the experience is like for a retail user. Maker isn\u2019t even an option for many retail users as the friction and UX aren\u2019t user-friendly enough. If there was a standalone Maker Vault website that looked like Compound, I believe it would bring in more liquidity. And if we are in a bull market, we need to be ready for retail. ",
