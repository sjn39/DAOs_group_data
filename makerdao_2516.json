In times of uncertainty when emergency shutdown become a possibility, the price of Dai will trend towards the expected payout in an emergency shutdown.

That said I love that people are still looking at the protocol\u2019s cash reserves and maybe raising it (even if it is mostly just a gesture) is worth doing so long as we have sufficient interest in doing so. If we ARE looking for ways to protect the protocol against potential future downturns given the current market conditions there probably are options I\u2019m just not sure that the stability buffer is our best one. Ones that immediately come to mind would be to preemptively trigger a flop auction while the price of MKR is still high, or potentially raising the LR to lower our VaR. Don\u2019t really expect either of those to be terribly popular options though so it really hasn\u2019t been something I have tried pursuing. ",

Would be used to pay for stuff as Maker functions become fully decentralized.  The cons of doing this in DAI exclusively is that it removes DAI liquidity from the markets and management issues (either by governance and/or smart contracts to place and fill orders) Which was why I suggested taking the system surplus and using it to buy assets that either rise in value when collateral in vaults drop, OR retain value.   DAI we know appreciates when markets are stressed and it would be a good thing to be able to directly inject DAI liquidity but this begs other questions. Based on what I see about the MKR flop/flap pricing mechanics honestly would rather buy MKR with DAI setting a floor price and sell it when price is high.   What that is - a moving target.  But the protocol sold MKR to cover losses at around 250 after buying it between 400-800 give or take.   Not really an ideal use of capital really. A longer term solution regarding creating and managing a secondary system surplus portfolio using the primary surplus DAI would probably be the best option here as then this secondary surplus asset portfolio could have in place some automatiion controlled by governance to place bids and offers for collateral using other DEXs to either inject or remove DAI as market conditions and prices of assets warrant.

Personally i think this boils down to what you view as a bigger risk market movements or people losing faith in the peg. I\u2019m of the opinion that being 1-3% off peg while not ideal probably isn\u2019t the end of the world especially since the arguments against it seem to be vague and hypothetical. Having no cash reserves on the other hand, well we saw how that played out last time. If this model by the risk team is to be believed we\u2019ve already burned through about 20% of the capital we could expect to raise through dilution, so we might be particularly exposed in the event of another large downturn and this time we have even more DAI lent so that further worsens the situation. That is why i would view bolstering cash reserves as a higher priority. Unfortunately though to save up a bit of a rainy day fund requires revenue and the way this protocol makes that is through loans, so at least for now I think these two problems likely have the same fix which is more collateral options. IMO the most important thing right now is finding collateral options that people are willing to pay premiums for in order to get leverage. If we can find that holy grail collateral and fill the current buffer then we can worry about whether or not we want to raise it. Until then though raising it is just a moot point. IMO its basically just setting a lofty savings goal. ",

                    "content": "    Planet_X:  Large buffers are bad.   I agree a large DAI surplus buffer is bad from a DAI market liquidity standpoint.   I disagree that a large surplus buffer of other assets (stablecoins and things that maintain or preferrably increase in value, that have largish market liquidity in DAI, when collateral values are dropping) is bad. imo Maker to be fully decentralized will probably have yearly expenses on the order of 1-2M DAI - minimum.  I am still waiting for an accounting of Maker Foundation yearly expenses honestly because I think they are far above 1-2M DAI/yr and more like 5-10M.   So yeah a secondary surplus buffer of at least 2M DAI is going to be required and while Maker likes to pay for work in DAI, it is not a good idea to have this liquidity removed from markets doing nothing. At some point, sooner than later, Maker governance is going to have to approve of something like MIP14, as well as the creation of a secondary surplus reserve to fund operations expenses, etc. and to also appoint working groups to adminster those funds.  The idea that Maker governance is going to micromange fund disbursal for anything will grow old and tiresome pretty fast imo.   The compensation group has been putting hours into the whole compensation thing now basically for free with no real compensation on the horizon whether it succeeds or fails.   I have seen dependency on volunteer work in other organizations grow until basically people providing it disappear. IF it is time for this organization to grow we need to step back and address the real issues directly and proactively vs. waiting for them to become problems that need \u2018emergency\u2019 measures. This is not only true of the concept of how to manage the system surplus, but how to deal with managing DAI liquidity, PEG, handle dark fixes and dark topics.  Giving responsibility and authority to EPCs regarding changing SFs, DCs, RPs, etc.   A group making a recommendation that governance votes Yes/No on anothing thorny topic.  The whole idea of Maker deciding to manage the PEG directly.   CBs and governments handle this by making surprise announcements, then doing surprise interventions etc.  (discussed/planned a secret way) is completely lost here in this open governance model.   Which means we lose tools to manage market expectations to help us. Everything has pros/cons.   The multiple tasks set before us, in a very agressive timeline, is daunting.  A working group just to discuss and create such a larger visionary plan for Maker desperately needed vs. this micromanaging everything as someone puts it forward all the time organic model.  Providing funds for even a basic level of compensation for work on any of this stuff also needed.   While people have in their heads what will be needed, how to do this in a secure, trusted, verifiable, well managed/controlled AND decentralized model I think is not at all understood much less tried and tested. Increase the system surplus.   To me this one is a no-brainer.   The only issue is we don\u2019t want to hold it all in DAI to drain system liquidity and to create a secondary working account to deal with funding Maker operations.   This to me is also a no-brainer YES.   The thought is then how much and what kinds of funds (NOT DAI) to fill this secondary working account/buffer (whatever you want to call it) as well as how to administer it. ",
