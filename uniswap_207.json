                    "content": "There has been a lot of discussion around whether the \u201cFee Switch\u201d should be turned on. In most of this discussion I see an assumption that using the fee switch = money going to UNI token holders. I think this is limiting. The design space around how a fee switch can be used is much larger and it\u2019s crucially important to all of DeFi that we consider the design space broadly. Mindlessly adopting a generic \u201cstake UNI = get some sort of fee\u201d would miss the incredible opportunity we have to think creatively about how protocols, governance, and value accrual can work in Web3. The purpose of this post is make clear UNI governance has two very different decisions to make 1). should a fee switch be turned on? and 2) how should fees be utilized? By separating these decisions we may actually be able to move faster. The stakes are high Uniswap is the #1 DeFi protocol \u2013 both in terms of utilization and ethos. What Uniswap chooses to do with the \u201cfee switch\u201d will set precedent for the whole industry. Much like the retro-active UNI token airdrop set precedent for how to distribute governance. The high stakes make complacency a comfortable option but there is equal risk in waiting too long to explore this tool. The \u201cfee switch\u201d Design Space I believe the term \u201cfee switch\u201d is a misnomer. It refers to the ability for the Uniswap protocol to retain a portion of what is already being paid to the liquidity providers. The protocol retaining a portion of this gives UNI token holders new tools to leverage in furthering the growth and mission of the protocol. It does not create any expectation the retained tokens will be paid out to UNI token holders.   Public goods funding (thus far the #1 use of the protocol treasury)   Building protocol owned liquidity   Funding grants / developers / etc. for the Uniswap Protocol specifically   Other things we can imagine!    Should the \u201cfee switch\u201d be turned on? I believe the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d. It should be turned on in a limited testing capacity. Doing this now will 1) provide us with real data and 2) provide the community more time to consider how assets accrued via this mechanism should be used. At this point, it\u2019s too large of an unexplored design space to neglect. As mentioned already, this will not increase fees for people using the protocol to swap. It will simply retain a small portion of what is currently being paid out to liquidity providers. What are the next steps? Uniswap V3 sets fees on a per pool basis. This means we can turn the fees for a limited set of pools. We can analyze the impact this change has and use results to discuss. I\u2019m suggesting a simple standard \u2013 if trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the \u201cfee switch\u201d turned on \u2013 the experiment is a success. I suggest we start with two of the largest pools, one stable <> stable pairing and one stable <> volatile. I also suggest we start with the lowest possible setting of 1/10. Based on recent data, these modest changes should accrue $20-$40k per day to the protocol. According to this Dune dashboard, total LP fees over the last 7 days have been $9.5 million. Assuming the lowest possible setting (1/10) that\u2019s 950k per week the protocol hypothetically could be accruing. The cost of inaction is high. Specification:  USDC / ETH @ 0.05%, initialize 1/10 \u201cprotocol fee\u201d USDC / USDT @ 0.01%, initialize 1/10 \u201cprotocol fee\u201d  Feedback! This is an important decision, let\u2019s discuss! In accordance with governance procedures, I\u2019ve created a temperature check vote here: Snapshot ",

This positions the proposal as somewhat of a win-win; if LPs are put off by the protocol fees, they may be interested to move their liquidity to the lower fee tier pools which would provide improved utility to the Uniswap ecosystem.

Incentivizing LPs to lock their liquidity within specific ranges for certain periods of time would make Uniswap TWAP oracles provably harder to manipulate (ref: https://blog.euler.finance/eulers-oracle-risk-grading-system-93f47d68205c). Safer oracles would make it easier for lending protocols to adopt Uniswap TWAP oracles instead of relying on more centralized solutions like Chainlink. I think it could be an interesting way to experiment with the fee switch for the following reasons:  Safer oracles would benefit the whole DeFi space; Over time this initiative could lead to Uniswap TWAP oracles becoming the gold standard in DeFi; All of the fees would still go to LPs, therefore potentially limiting the loss of pre-existing LPs as the fee switch is enabled; The fees would compensate longer focussed LPs over Just In Time liquidity providers; This initiative would be quite easy to roll back if it fails vs paying $UNI holders a dividend.  Just my two cents. Curious to see if there is any interest in this! ",

The fees are desperately needed to offset any IL in that pair.  So, I would not take fees away from USDC / ETH.  It\u2019s one of Uniswap\u2019s most dominant pairs, and any fees taken away from that pool will likely diminish Uniswap\u2019s market dominance. USDC/USDT 1 bps fee tier pool is extremely dependent on fees to make a respectable profit as well.  The margins are razor thin already.  Curve and CEXes also do offer respectable competition for these swaps. I guess the main purpose of this test is to see how much liquidity would leave after implementing a fee switch? I think that\u2019s a dangerous game.  The AMM design of Uniswap v3 was genius in that the concentration of liquidity allowed it to have an amplified effect, which got Uniswap 80% trade volume market share on a fraction of the TVL, but I don\u2019t think it should get too cocky or complacent with that lead.  Other AMMs like Curve v2, Sushi, Quickswap, Orca, and Shell Protocol are all developing their own concentrated liquidity platforms, which will likely make some dent in the trade volume market share of Uniswap in the future. Uniswap seems to be very well capitalized and endowed with a lot of funds for protocol development.  They even have enough funds to make venture investments of its own. So why is this needed?  Protocol owned liquidity is great, but it need not come from the fees.  I would rather see Uniswap fund these developments via providing liquidity in their own pools.  There are plenty of stable-stable pairs where good income can be made through either incentives programs provided by other protocols (such as Frax Finance and Angle Protocol, which offer double digit yields on Uniswap\u2019s stable-stable pairs) and via leveraged stablecoin liquidity providing.  Thus, I\u2019d rather see Uniswap bring in this income via liquidity providing in their own pools versus taking fees away from the LPs.  Its double benefit that way where you increase Uniswap\u2019s liquidity and maintain a competitive edge over other AMMs that are vying to take market share away from Uniswap. ",

I can understand concentrated liquidity managers and others building on top of Uniswap charging fees for managed services. But the base layer? 10 percent of all fees?! Just like in government or business, if you\u2019re going to create taxes or fees that make you less competitive and less capital efficient, you should probably have a rigorous plan of how you wish to spend those funds. A plan with accountability that benefits the protocol, UNI holders, and LPs (especially LPs in this case).  Public goods funding (thus far the #1 use of the protocol treasury) Building protocol owned liquidity Funding grants / developers / etc. for the Uniswap Protocol specifically Other things we can imagine!   This is not an acceptable plan. The last one is particularly concerning. Just fund whatever you want because you can? That\u2019s defi education fund vibes. Seriously consider reducing the % of the fees you are seeking, create a spending plan for any raised funds, and create a backtest for a variety of pools (small, large, stable-stable, stable-eth) before you just stick it to the LPs.

I\u2019m pro-experimentation but think this proposal is riskier than it seems on the surface. The risk in my opinion doesn\u2019t necessarily come from the action of turning on the fee switch itself, and indeed I think that liquidity providers should build their businesses around the assumption that that happens some day in the future. Instead, I think the decoupling of two distinct but related questions (\u201cCan the protocol charge fees\u201d and \u201cWhat will the protocol do with the fees that it earns\u201d) is where the danger lies. Uniswap\u2019s governance is still in its formative stages and though the past year has seen some positive outcomes, kicking the can down the road and trusting that we\u2019ll figure out how to manage and deploy this income stream is not a good look. It\u2019s irresponsible to make a foundational shift in the economics of an entire set of users without telling them why that shift is being made. And this is not even taking into account the regulatory risk to token holders which, \\ __o __/, I\u2019m not qualified to speak on. With that said, there is definitely an opportunity to fund research around this topic so that we can make a more comprehensive plan on how to change a key tenet of the biggest dex in the market and arguably the most important protocol on Ethereum. Off the top of my head, I\u2019d like to have as a start:  a framework for categorizing pool types. @wilsoncusack gets at this a bit in his post but I think a more rigorous quantitative and qualitative definition would be useful in figuring out a) how to test and b) assuming test results positive, how to roll out to all existing pools a plan for converting long-tail shitcoins into useful stables (a la 1Inch) and a backtest run on that plan including a sensitivity analysis on what happens when LPs leave in varying quantities.  I would be hugely supportive of anyone that wants to propose that type of research and am happy to be a sounding board for anyone that\u2019s thinking along those lines. ",

                    "content": "TL;DR: I am 100% supportive of this proposal to add the 1/10 protocol fee to a selected number of \u201csister\u201d pools. I propose to first activate it for the following pools:  DAI-ETH-0.05% USDT-ETH-0.3% USDC-ETH-1%  The Uniswap Grants program (or internal research) should then study the effects of the protocol fee on LP revenue to guide the general decision-making process for fee activation.   I think a major consideration here is whether or not liquidity providers remove liquidity as a result.  The impact on the revenue liquidity providers for doing so will be minimal, here\u2019s why. First, one has to understand where fees come from. While fees obviously result from trading activity, the way orders are routed play an important role in how much volume each pool gets. Transactions will always be routed to the pool that minimizes the slippage, which means that the 0.05% fee pool will \u201callow\u201d more transactions through because it will always capture all transactions between 0.05% and 0.3% slippage limit. We can see the price of each pool and the number of transactions in each pool for the ETH-USDC pools:  image1920\u00d71053 93.9 KB  Note how the price in the lower left panel is much finely-grained for the 0.05% than for the 1% pool. However, the 1% pool sees larger jumps between trades. But each of these pools should track the same price and, by association, each pool should have the same properties, including the fees collected and the price\u2019s realized volatility. How does volatility relate to LP revenues? I explicitly derived this relationship between volatility (which is related to expected revenues), feeTier, liquidity and dailyVolume in several post (this post is the most relevant), and it is given by  image1400\u00d7221 68.8 KB  where gamma \u03b3 is the feeTier+protocolFee, and LP revenue is ~Impl.Vol * \u221atimeInPool Therefore, regardless of the feeTier+protocolFee, each pool of the same asset pair should generate the same amount of fee per unit of liquidity. An intuitive way to think about this is that if PoolA generates less revenue than PoolB, then rational LPs will relocate their liquidity to PoolB to capture that edge. This is also true if we look between the ETH-stablecoin \u201csister pools\u201d like ETH-USDC/DAI/USDT: they should all generate the same revenue as long as the keep the same peg, and that means they should all have the same implied volatility. Is this really a valid assumption? If we look at the implied volatility as derived above for all ETH-stablecoin pairs, we see that the IV for all pool are somewhat consistent at around 130% for most pools:  image1920\u00d7995 92.2 KB  hint: rational LPs should re-deploy liquidity to the high IV pools to maximize revenue There are a couple of outliers, but let me focus on the USDC/ETH pools:  USDC/ETH 0.05%: IV = 116% USDC/ETH 0.3%: IV = 131% USDC/ETH 1%: IV = 125%  While each pool has a different feeTier, transaction routing means that each pool gets a different amount of daily volume, and this daily volume is matched by a different amount of \u201ctick liquidity\u201d that minimized slippage. This, in a way, magically brings them all within a similar implied volatility and LP revenue range, but there is no clear trend (we have IV: 0.3% > 0.05% > 1%, but volume is: 0.05% > 0.3% > 1% and tickTVL is: 0.3% > 1% > 0.05%). Hence, I predict that activating a 1/10 protocol fee to any one of those pools would re-shuffle some of the liquidity provisioning, but all pools will still converge to the same IV and LP revenue at the end of the day. So, I propose that the Uniswap Governance enables the 1/10 protocol fees for a few ETH-stablecoin sister pools and use the Uniswap Grants program (or internal research) to study the effects of the protocol fee on LP revenue. The pools could be:  Dai/ETH 0.05% ETH/USDT 0.3% USDC/ETH 1%  Or any combination of ETH-stablecoin pools across non-overlapping feeTiers. ",

More precisely, we modelled how high the take rate (or \u201cprotocol fee\u201d) should optimally be. For more details, see this post: Research on the Fee Switch That being said, for the beginning, the lowest possible value, i.e. 1/10 = 10%, as suggested by the proposal, is probably a good choice.   One crucial question that could be answered by experimenting with the fee switch, is measuring how strong Uniswap\u2019s moat is over other DEXs. (In a fully rational market, the DEX with the lowest protocol fee should attract most liquidity and volume. But in reality, Uniswap, as the clear market leader, likely has an competitive advantage over other DEXs, and can afford a higher protocol fee. The question is, by how much?) However, one Uniswap v3 pool of course has no moat over another. So this effect could not be measured, if the fee switch is only flipped for one fee tier for a certain pair. Instead, flipping the switch for all fee tiers for a certain pair could be considered (maybe for a \u201cless important\u201d token pair?).   Finally, a more philosophical thought  In the long run, it might be inevitable that a part of trading fees goes to UNI token holders - simply due to the fact that exactly these token holders can decide on the matter. The longer token holder receive no rewards, and the lower the expectation of this happening in the future becomes, the more the value of UNI tokens declines. Until at some point, it becomes cheap enough for someone to buy a sufficient amount of UNI tokens to vote to distribute fees to token holders (including themselves). ",

One of the things that I think we need to be aware of is not just the allocation of trade volume and the IV of strictly the Uni v3 pools, but the effect this would have in diverting the trade volume away from Uniswap as a whole to another AMM when using a DEX aggregator.  Small divergences in liquidity could lead to leakage of trade volume that would have been allocated to Uniswap.  I think it\u2019s a mistake to assume that the fee switch would involve liquidity or volume moving to a different Uniswap v3 pool as they could just leave Uniswap entirely! For example a 10 ETH trade for USDC on Paraswap does not even make it to a Uniswap v3 pool as the price impact would be lower going through Paraswap\u2019s pools instead.  image1790\u00d7896 105 KB  So, I can\u2019t imagine that any further restrictions on liquidity such as a fee switch would help us in competing as a whole against other AMMs when it comes to DEX aggregators.  Therefore, I think a technical analysis needs to include how a fee switch could affect our competitiveness on DEX aggregators as well. But more importantly, before we even get there, I wish there was more clarity and information given on whether implementing a fee switch is really the best way to achieve the outcomes we\u2019re trying to accomplish.  I\u2019m not so sure.  What alternatives are there to implementing a fee switch in getting the revenue that we need to get?  I worry that this sets a dangerous precedent and moral hazard issues when it comes to a treasury that is flush with trade fee revenues.  Like it hasn\u2019t been made entirely clear what specifically these funds would be used for.  Like what kinds of public goods?  Like the DeFi Education Fund?  I sure hope not. I\u2019d rather we have the specific goal in mind first before getting the funds.  Right now, it seems like we\u2019re getting the funds first and then figuring out what to do with them.  It creates a moral hazard in my opinion.  Right now the UNI distribution is still very much concentrated in the hands of a very few influential parties.  I would wait for a more decentralized distribution of UNI before implementing this kind of power. Research without actually implementing the fee switch is certainly possible thru backtesting.  Using the pretenses of \u201cresearch,\u201d to actually implement a fee switch into production for the first time is a very dangerous precedent. ",

It seems kind of silly to be limited to such a large increment increase. Can this be changed?  The whole point of my post is that I am suggesting NO PLAN for how these accrued tokens might be used. I\u2019m explicitly trying to separate the testing of value accrual from how / if that value is disbursed.  But this plan does propose how these funds might be used, by suggestion and omission. The glaring one is no distributions to UNI holders. I get what you\u2019re saying, but any fee switch is inevitably going to discuss the trade-offs from taking said fees. Just like a tax increase, someone has to pay for this, and someone gets to spend the money on something. I think that is the most important part of a fee switch scenario. If this is just a test in prod of how the fee switches will affect liquidity, the LPs, and determine fee generation/mechanics, I would suggest conducting a controlled test over a specific period of time. Then stopping to assess the test. ",

Only then should we think about the financing decision: How are we going to fund what we want to fund? Said another way: By taxing LP\u2019s fees by 10%, you\u2019re implicitly saying \u201cUniswap governance knows what to do with this 10% of these fees better than you do\u201d. I agree with @Buckerino\u2019s point that it\u2019s not the most important question. I think the most important question is \u201cWhat is goal/mission of Uniswap and its treasury?\u201d Until that question is answered, along with how funds would be allocated to further that goal, it doesn\u2019t make sense to divert fees from LPs to the treasury.

                    "content": "I\u2019d like to offer an alternative perspective on some comments I\u2019m seeing. @ConcernedLP, @Brenner, @Buckerino and @eek637 have all voiced concerns along these lines:  Fee switch is not high priority at this stage, and other projects are higher priority Uniswap Governance needs to figure out what it wants to even spend funds on first  Other Internet has studied Uniswap governance extensively and has talked to stakeholders of many different types, and while I hear these concerns, I do not believe they are entirely correct.   Part of the reason for general governance inaction in Uniswap is, in fact, the lack of non-UNI funds in the treasury. Without stables or more liquid currencies like ETH to spend, the UNI token must be liquidated every time a significant opportunity arises. We currently are in a situation in which UNI selloffs to service providers, public goods projects, and grantees that exert downward price pressure on the token in the long run. (Recall the significant backlash about UNI price when DeFi Education Fund liquidated $12.5m in one day). Moreover, generating assets in the treasury that can be spent on protocol growth and expansion makes the governance token more valuable. Recently governance nerds have been obsessed with NounsDAO, a protocol with extraordinarily high levels of governance activity. The number one reason Nouns has generated such a high volume of proposals is that it has significant treasury holdings, spending of which do not dilute Noun holders\u2019 token value. Everything we\u2019ve seen so far suggests that if Uniswap were generating even $10k of ETH & USDC in fees per day, we would likewise see a much higher volume of governance activity and proposals on this forum.   Firstly, we have to stop referring to \u201cUniswap Governance\u201d as a monolith. What we are is a collection of actors with very different incentives. Uniswap is very poorly structured from an ownership perspective, having airdropped to all classes of users. This makes it incredibly unrealistic for people to come together to intentionally decide what to fund at the current moment. Outside of an off-site retreat for major UNI voters, I don\u2019t see a good way to reach consensus on this. OI has taken some responsibility for advocating for specific outcomes we\u2019d like to see here; one of these is the creation of concentrated centers of authority, such as an expanded version of Uniswap Grants Program with a bigger mandate, who we believe would be suitable to set specific goals and drive specific visions. In lieu of these authority centers existing right now, I believe that the higher volume of proposals stimulated by more liquid assets in the treasury would incentivize a greater degree of competition and higher quality proposals brought to this forum. Right now delegates have too little work to do. Perhaps this is idealistic, but more competition among a higher volume of proposals would force all of us to be more selective and evolve a set of criteria for treasury spend.   A final comment is that nonnative assets in the treasury would make it easier to conceive of spending money on things like paid delegation programs, which would overall improve the quality of governance. In short, I can\u2019t conceive of the fee switch initiative as low priority. The fee switch is one of the few clear on-chain levers we have available to us to drive more governance work and better outcomes at this time. ",

Without stables or more liquid currencies like ETH to spend, the UNI token must be liquidated every time a significant opportunity arises.   There are two ways to get non-UNI funds into the treasury.  Sell UNI from the treasury, which impact UNI holders (by decreasing the price) take a portion of LP fees, which impacts LPs (by taxing them)  Assuming LPs are providing liquidity out of pure economic interest, to impose #2 on LPs, the case has to be made \u201cthis tax will improve your economics in the long run\u201d. I have looked through everything I can find from/on Uniswap, and I cannot find a stated goal or mission.* I agree that having some amount of ETH or USDC in the treasury might attract more proposals. But without having a more clear goal or mission for UNI holders and arguably more importantly, for LPs to get behind, the fee switch is a hard case to make. A world in where I see turning on some fees working:  State the goal of UNI is to create the deepest liquidity and thus the best to trade in the universe Pick a number: $5m, $10M, and turn fees on for less important pools until that number is reached, and then turn them off. It\u2019s a seed round. Fund individuals / teams that are directly aligned with the stated goal of UNI.  Long term, I think fees on top of LP fees instead of taking a portion of the LPs\u2019 fees is more sustainable. It affects LPs less, and doesn\u2019t directly drive liquidity to other AMMs.  Which can or may be separate from Uniswap Lab\u2019s goal or mission. Since it\u2019s a C-corp, by default it is \u201cmake a return on investment for shareholders\u201d. And I\u2019m sure they have their own way(s) they plan on doing that, separate from the fee switch.  ",

Taking away 10% of revenues from LPs risking impermanent loss etc\u2026 Might be considered too high. On the other hand, LPs are indeed interested in seeing Uniswap have more assets to incetivize development and innovation. Instead of doing a unilateral proposal for fee switch with predetermined parameters, I think an invite to LPs should be done and ask what would be an ideal fee switch for them to decide to provide more liquidity, in different pairs, for example. I think this kind of proposal should be really discussed with LPs, a roadmap should be designed, and the future should not be uncertain, the opposite as Uniswap only exists because of the LP-protocol relationship. Having said that, until april 2023, Uniswap has a form of protection, what will happen after that, what about VCs, using the Uniswap code, forking it and developing for stocks for example\u2026 So many questions out there, but honestly, I feel like the fee switch is something that could benefit everyone if enacted properly.

Variant is an investor in the UNI token and Uniswap Labs, Inc. TLDR:  In favor of experimentation The experiment should test non-core pools for data points that map to the rest of Uni pairs; strong candidates include WBTC/USDC, DAI/ETH, and USDC/ETH The first fee switch worth testing may be one that generates non-UNI assets for the treasury; these funds should be used to incentivize ecosystem growth among other Uni stakeholders  Derek and I are in favor of experimentation with fee splits, and think the proposal outlined is incredibly thoughtful and a strong step in the right direction. Pool Analysis We agree that the biggest risk, as pointed out by several commentators, is a liquidity drain among core pools. As such, there\u2019s likely a good middle ground of pools to test \u2013 ones that are not core pools (e.g., USDT/USDC and USDC/ETH, as pointed out by Monet Supply) but are still sufficiently large to gather data points that map to the rest of Uni pairs. Having relevant data points will help better understand the potential impact of broader / more widespread fee switch implementations. The optimal pool should satisfy the following conditions:  Relatively high Volume / TVL (APY) so LPing still remains profitable Relatively deep liquidity to not potentially drain important liquidity Ideally relatively similar valued assets to avoid potential IL increases  Below is an analysis of Uni V3 pools 11th-20th in TVL:  From the analysis, WBTC/USDC, DAI/ETH, and USDC/ETH (1% tier) seem to be suitable pools for experimentation. Fee Switch Design We\u2019re supportive of directing a portion of the fees toward building non-UNI reserves in the treasury (with funds potentially stored in stables), in line with Toby\u2019s comment. We agree that those funds should be invested in continued growth, e.g., funding grants, incentivizing integrations, and whatever else the community determines may help Uniswap grow. ",

Guillaume suggests that liquidity reshuffling between fee tiers would create an equilibrium of LP fees per unit of liquidity provided, which is in theory completely correct. However, this equilibrium would either be:   a) Lower than the previous equilibrium - i.e., the protocol fee is \u2018spread\u2019 across all fee tiers (and \u2018sister pools\u2019 in theory) and still paid by LPs, albeit by each pool in a smaller amount;   b) The same/similar, but transaction routing moves trades to tiers with worse net pricing as a result of liquidity reshuffling, and so traders pay the fee;   c) Some combination of a) and b), which is what would happen in reality.   A key insight from a) is that a lower equilibrium fee switch, i.e., below the 1/10 minimum, could be applied to all LPs by only turning on the fee switch in select pools (as is being suggested for testing). To think about this differently, the current liquidity distribution is, of course, optimizing for LP revenue, which in turn is optimizing for maximum daily volume per unit of liquidity in each pool, which in turn is optimizing to give traders the best net pricing experience across the pools. Turning on a switch in any fee tier will alter the liquidity distribution and result in sub-optimal/worse net pricing across all tiers for a given pair/collection of \u2018sister\u2019 pairs. The traders who would have been trading in that pool on the margin will then either continue with their trade anyway (i.e., scenario b) or halt their trade entirely (scenario a). The extent to which scenario a or b occurs will be determined by the price sensitivity of the traders, which in turn will be determined by the availability of strong alternative protocols. ",

However, I think that you are not giving enough credit and consideration to the unique potential of UNI holders passively accruing fees simply by staking UNI. This possibility should neither be written off nor disregarded. Please consider this more carefully. The Uniswap protocol touches just about every compelling asset in cryptocurrency landscape by enabling permissionless liquidity provision. Now imagine staking UNI and passively accruing an entire portfolio of assets (volume-weighted by trading volume on uniswap). UNI, in this sense, could become the ultimate Web3 \u201cfixed-income\u201d asset. Holders of UNI can passively accrue every asset that trades on the protocol. This is incredibly powerful and unprecedented. Wealth managers across the world would pile into UNI simply to have this exposure, and accrue exposure for their clients to all Web3 assets trading on the Uniswap protocol.  Nothing like this has ever been done before. It\u2019s magical, in a way. Eventually, we can assume that tokenized equities, fixed income assets, tokenized real estate, tokenized fiat currencies, tokenized derivatives/options/swaps/etc and much more may trade on Uniswap v3. And simply by holding the UNI token, one can slowly accumulate exposure to all these different assets\u2026 Imagine that. WoW! Incredible\u2026 You say at the beginning of your proposal: \u201cI see an assumption that using the fee switch = money going to UNI token holders. I think this is limiting.\u201d I disagree strongly. I don\u2019t think this line of thinking is limiting at all. In fact, it is fascinating! I believe this is what UNI was in part destined to be\u2026 the primary asset that allows holders to accumulate and accrue a vast and diversified portfolio of positions across every Web3 asset that trades on the Uniswap protocol. To me, a veteran of traditional finance, this is simply an incredible opportunity for the UNI asset - and it should not be ignored. ",

This would allow UNI holders to stake the uni and provide that wrapped UNI to the pool to limit loss from the fees lost in the LP, Also having a UNI/WUNI pool would allow routing through this pool with regular UNI token routes Now the main reason we can bring in UNI LP providers is that in this contract we would want to retain UNI Holder Voting rights, the Vote would need to be done via this contract and have a ipfs site to vote on, but by tracking and setting the users ability to send vote via the contracts holding of their UNI, this would allow them to still Vote, although a different delegate system would also have to be set up But by reducing the loss in LP fees and allowing UNI holders to keep their voting power, I do believe this would be enough incentive for LP providers of UNI token at least Obviously this would be a very complicated contract, but I do believe that this would offer a good incentive to open a Fee Switch Testing pool ",

                    "content": "What an exciting conversation! Our community (Civilization) have been working over the past 12 months on building a decentralised hedge fund, with an initial priority focus on v3 liquidity mining. So we have collected a significant body of evidence, research and technical expertise. Rather intimate knowledge of the mechanisms surrounding concentrated liquidity. This proposal directly affects and changes our ability to generate a return for our community, and I feel it\u2019s worth sharing my perspective for everyone\u2019s benefit (in case anyone cares to follow up, please feel free to give me a shout @civ100 on Telegram). In my view, the \u201cfee switch\u201d is equivalent to a \u201crevenues-based income tax\u201d, similar to European-style VAT, whereby the government earns a % of revenues before anything is paid into the seller\u2019s account. There are some technical differences, in who pays how much and how, but substantially the outcome is the same, minus the important \u201crecover VAT on purchases\u201d element, which makes VAT sustainable. As an income-generating entity, the LP provider will only get 90% of their earnings, whereby 10% is paid to the \u201cgovernment\u201d (UNI governance). In this way, the \u201cgovernment\u201d effectively can accrue a benefit equivalent to having up to $400mln of TVL invested = 10% of current total TVL of >$4 billion, assuming the fee will be switched on for all pools, which eventually would likely be, post-experiments. Crucially, the \u201cgovernment\u201d doesn\u2019t suffer any entrepreneurial risk, no impermanent loss, and doesn\u2019t actually need to invest those $400mln. Is this beneficial, desirable and survivable for both Uniswap and UNI? Yes, for sure. Uniswap has a strong enough brand and technology lead for sustaining this over the medium term, beyond the initial experiment. The concentrated liquidity research was pioneering and market-defining, and I am sure Uniswap will continue to lead the rest of the DEFI market by a wide margin. However painful this will be for LP, who already contend with extremely razor-thin profits after hedging, this is unavoidable. Today, v3 is the only protocol with a chance of going mainstream. Also, this must be tested and implemented well ahead of the 2-year code-lock expiring, so it feels like the time has come. Writing and maintaining protocols is complex and expensive, and after all, there must be rewards for their authors, it\u2019s only fair. But - will this be sustainable long-term? It depends. If the comparison reference is to the government\u2019s VAT tax, then a 10% tax is relatively cheap when compared to a 20% VAT rate, or even higher in some countries. If the comparison is the government\u2019s \u201crevenues tax\u201d levied by some countries on e.g. technology companies, then 10% is a lot: 2-3% is more common. However, crucially, if the comparison was to TradFi, I can\u2019t begin to imagine how exporting Uniswap technology beyond DeFi could sustain this type of monopolistic margins. A traditional market-maker charged 10% of their revenues to access a platform just feels unreal. Market-making will need to be more profitable and easier than would be the case for v3 LPs after the fee switch, so the new technology can be equally beneficial to all parties. Long story short: I think the fee switch is inevitable, but in Uniswap v4 it better be brought to a lower level than 10%. This brilliant tech will then get the mainstream adoption it fully deserves!

                    "content": "Disclaimer: The authors of this post do not currently hold UNI tokens or provide liquidity to the protocol, although they have in the past. We are an unbiased third party. This post was co-authored by Matt Fiebach and Dan Smith from Blockworks Research. In our opinion, the protocol fee switch should be activated for a trial period at the minimum 1/10 protocol fee with revenue flowing to the Uniswap treasury address 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC. Uniswap\u2019s most valuable pool is USDC/ETH 0.05% as it single-handedly generates ~50% of protocol volume. Therefore, including it in the trial risks liquidity outflows that jeopardize Uniswap volume dominance. Selecting the remaining highest volume pools limits the risk of the trial while accurately measuring its impact on LPs. Including one USDC, USDT, and DAI pool allows LPs who are not happy with the fee switch to move to different pools for the same assets. The following pools should be included in the trial set: \u2022 DAI/ETH 0.05% \u2022 USDT/ETH 0.30% \u2022 USDC/ ETH 1.00%  We agree with \u201cguil-lambert\u201d that LP shuffling is an essential factor in determining which pools to include in the trial set. The repercussion of implementing the protocol fee across the board is very different than for only 1 fee tier as the protocol fee is effectively dispersed across pairs.      guil-lambert:  Hence, I predict that activating a 1/10 protocol fee to any one of those pools would re-shuffle some of the liquidity provisioning, but all pools will still converge to the same IV and LP revenue at the end of the day.    Prior to activation, we strongly suggest agreeing on a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d level that discontinues the fee switch if Uniswap stable/ETH volume market share decreases by X% for Y length of time. However, this metric can be maliciously influenced by LPs. If a circuit breaker is not determined prior to the activation of the fee switch, the protocol risks losing market share while governance debates potential options.  It is worth noting that if this test goes successfully without a liquidity drain, it does not necessarily imply that the same would be true if the fee were imposed on all stable/ETH pools. In the scenario that the trial period is deemed a failure and the fee switch is discontinued (i.e. leads to a negative impact on Uniswap\u2019s stable/ETH volume), we believe LPs should be compensated using treasury held UNI. We propose LPs are repaid, in UNI, for the 1/10 protocol fee they forfeited. To prevent immediate UNI dumping (negative UNI price impact), creating a vesting contract that would look something like LPs getting the protocol fee back in 2 year locked 6 month vested UNI. This essentially acts as a Uniswap treasury swap to diversify assets without the same implications as market selling UNI. ",

                    "content": "Really happy to see this discussion take place. I\u2019ll share my current thoughts: Firstly, restating the important and obvious: Currently, all initiatives (costs) are paid by UNI holders by diluting the token price. The only upward pressure to UNI price comes from investors expecting a return in the future. Thus, the first conclusion is that something needs to be done to generate revenue or alternatively run an unsustainable operation to zero. I\u2019d like to echo @tobyshorin\u2019s first point. I\u2019ve previously had the intuitive sense that activating the fee switch would supercharge Uniswap governance. Toby\u2019s first point argues that having a treasury of stables would make governance participation more attractive. It should also result in more financial discipline in the DAO. The external positive effects seem understated in the discussions. I believe there is a wide false sense of \u201chaving a lot of money to spend\u201d from the UNI treasury (= genesis allocation). This capital should be treated with the same level of rigour as corporate equity. Uniswap needs stables to its treasury to have better understanding of real costs and to always carefully consider when to dilute the UNI token. The fee switch is probably the best bet of accumulating this treasury. As for the execution, I support @guil-lambert\u2019s direction of testing out the fee switch in various \u201csister\u201d pools. I do see the risks involved to run the tests on the most important pools as outlined by @BP333. I\u2019d also encourage people to dive into @rfritsch\u2019s model. The main purpose of running the fee switch test should be to get an understanding of Uniswap\u2019s real market position and possible moat (Modeled by sticky volume & sticky liquidity). We could then use this information to estimate the behavior in other pools. @MattOnChain\u2019s idea of compensating LPs with vested UNI tokens for possible losses is interesting, but I am against this. Having this type of \u201cbailout\u201d mechanism could distort the test behaviour of LPs, leading to results not beneficial to future use. Furthermore, any protocol revenue generated this way would not count as net revenue. Liquidity mining programs could be run at some point again but should be kept separate from this test. ",

Too easily manipulated. So it\u2019s important to have accurate numbers and hard facts to inform the democratic process.  think about how easy it is to become a market maker with UNI v3, and a profitable one, with each its own parameters.  To become a market-maker and earn tokens in liquidity fees is agreeably very easy. Are you sure, however, that to do so on a consistently profitable basis is equally easy? We have been researching hedging strategies against impermanent loss over quite a long period of time. We ended up with a complex delta-neutral hedge operation, involving automation of multiple dex and cex positions linked to each LP. This FYI is the main point of our own Civilization protocol - to offer broad access. And if our fund is still in pre-launch mode 1 year later, this is only due to the complexity of an operation that saw other providers attempting a similar development in the past suffering either zero profits, hacks (or both). For sure, such hedging strategies are beyond reach of the average retail investor. If I remember correctly, even the white paper of Uniswap v3 suggested that devs expected this not to be a retail-friendly system. Unsurprisingly, some 2021 research suggested that many LPs operate at a loss. Now I do not trust that piece of research at face value, as it was partial and funded by other protocols with conflicting interests. However, the complexity of running a consistently profitable operation at scale (vis-a-vis buy-and-hold or simple staking) does match my field experience. If my hypothesis was indeed correct, then a 10% tax could make the whole difference between profit and loss, or even sustainable profit vs unsustainably razor-thin margins, even for professional operators. Do you have personal experience with easily profitable LP strategies on v3 at scale? If so, I would love to chat further: our decentralised protocol offers immediate incentives to anyone helping to improve our service to the broader DeFi and crypto community. Making v3 liquidity provision consistently profitable would be a huge step toward mass adoption in TradFi, wouldn\u2019t it? So let\u2019s make it right  ",

Asserting my own opinion\u2026 I don\u2019t believe taking an academic/research driven approach prior to proceeding with the fee-switch for experimenting with non-core pools is exactly necessary. The Uniswap governance has the flexibility to learn from liquidity data of how toggling the fee switch on the pools suggested by @guil-lambert, and @alanalevin impacts liquidity drain. Backing out of the protocol fee is an option at a later date. I would wager with high conviction that the minimum 10% protocol fee as a percentage of the swap fees on three (small low-TVL) non-core pools is unlikely to be an existential threat to the attractiveness of Uniswap being the dominant AMM for consistent APY. Only after we have collected data can the community be okay with making heuristic arguments on whether if the protocol fee can be extended to a wider list of pools (or the protocol in its entirety). I don\u2019t mean to sway away researchers, but we need to maintain a healthy balance between practical solutions rather than surgically polished academic research that would realistically take months to produce. Hypothetically speaking, if the protocol fee of 10% on all swap fees can be broadly applied to all pools, what would stop the governance to pushing-up the protocol fee to 25% for all swap fees, or variable based on the classification of the pool? What we\u2019re trying to achieve here can never be fully described and optimized in formal language. We need to maintain focus and keep the momentum up with a monumental 40M large voting barrier, or we risk stagnation. There probably are going to be times where we can get it wrong for some select pools. Though how hard would it be re-incentivize liquidity by backtracking the fee-switch? ",

My questoins regarding the MEV JIT LPs is, is it positive for Uniswap? Is it a necessary evil in order to make sure the pools are liquid enough for traders ? Or without it is it better because of a better redistribution to passive LPs ? Maybe UNI should implement a fee switch in order to foster research in this direction, and maybe manage to prevent bad actors (if MEV JIT LPs are actually bad) to \u201csteal\u201d liquidity from \u201chonest\u201d LPs\u2026 It\u2019s a lot of question marks here, I honestly don\u2019t have the final answers as to this phenomenon.

I absolutely want fee teirs on but turning it on on a few pools to \u201ccollect data\u201d seems incredibly stupid to me. Imagine you are in a casino that doesn\u2019t charge rake. The casino is thinking about charging rake so it turns on the rake on a few tables. What happens? Everyone will leave the newly raked tables to go to the non raked tables. The casino concludes that they should avoid rake because everyone would stop playing if there was a rake. But this is wrong because at casinos that have every table raked people still play. TLDR the data that comes from \u201cturning on a few pools to test\u201d will be completely useless and lead to false conclusions bc of spillover effects. We know that exchanges can exist with rake, just add it on everything. Posting a reply to my tweet since it was also relevant:  Mihai: or add it to all pools of a certain pair, so there\u2019s no rake-less pool to go to (on uniswap)  My reply: Yes this is good but there is still the issue of bypassing since Uniswap is a network For example, if you rake DAI ETH, you can go DAI \u2192 USDC via DAI/USDC 0.01% fee their and then USDC \u2192 ETH via USDC/ETH so you bypass the rake for only a 0.01% fee. This is particularly a problem for orders that are routed using a smart router, since you will see flow tend to bypass the pool which creates a vicious cycle that can basically make the pool obsolete. no hard feelings towards @guil-lambert, OP, or anyone else who is advocating for this approach but IMO this is completely the wrong way to go about this. The data we gather will be incredibly misleading. ",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to specify a use for these funds, but some obvious things come to mind. In terms of adding funds to existing initiatives, options are:  Funding next version of Uniswap Grants Program with fees. Adding funds to the bug bounty.  In terms of new initiatives, there is an enormous amount of value to be gained in funding dedicated entities to take on certain aspects of protocol governance work that currently is not happening because none of us are getting paid.  Designing a paid delegation program. Creating a special purpose vehicle to act as legal counterparty on dao2dao transactions and contracts, e.g. like those that have happened with Voltz, the Polygon team, Moonbeam, and so on. (We have another report coming out soon that details some of the accountability issues that we\u2019ve seen in the Uniswap ecosystem that covers this in greater detail). Independent team focused on procurement work along the lines of what we have been doing with our crosschain governance initiative. This is especially critical now that Uniswap Labs has increasingly stepped back. Hiring new development orgs to make new contributions to the protocol, like what Scopelift has done with its recent grants from UGP.  Even without deciding a larger \u201cmission\u201d for Uniswap, these opportunities are pretty obvious and I daresay necessary steps for growing Uniswap\u2019s competitiveness. @leighton I think a viable next step for moving this conversation forward would be writing the code for a parameter change that takes the preceding conversation here into account and posting it here as a concrete artifact for debate and more discussion.

                    "content": "Hello all, excellent discussion so far. Some thoughts as a humble Uniswap tourist.  I don\u2019t quite get why LPs are particularly concerned with this experiment on a limited set of pools. Either (a) the margins on the pools are really low and they leave, (b) margins are high for some LPs and they stay while others leave, or (c) LPs leave the pools that have the fee switch turned on en masse. In any case, LPs can vote with the purse, and I don\u2019t buy that turning the switch on is an irreversible transgression against LPs.  @Game_Theorist, you and I share a name and a passion for algo game theory! Your approach aligns perfectly with a rational-self-interested-agent approach, which is where my dispositions lie as well. But I see the point of this proposal being to test just how efficient liquidity provision is on Uni V3. I love hypothesizing from theory as much as the next guy, but to fully reject this proposal on your grounds, one would need to assert that these markets are efficient. And who the hell would dare rest their name on a claim that crypto markets are efficient? I think there\u2019s been precious little said about the legal concerns with this. I\u2019m no lawyer, but I at least know there\u2019s stuff I don\u2019t know, and it\u2019d be great to get someone who knows one to start thinking about the intricacies of the fee switch legally. This seems much higher priority than squabbling about LPs\u2019 opportunity costs for a short period of time on a limited number of pools. In a way, the fact that so much debate has occurred already on the fee switch is perhaps a valuable prior for understanding the probability that turning on the fee switch (for some pools) is \u201cgood\u201d. When optimal parameters are not known, it is necessary to search the param space to hone in on optimal parameters. Of course, if this exploration is extremely high-cost, e.g. in the form of securities backlash or bitter LPs, then there\u2019s reason for pause. But if LPs\u2019 capital allocation is nearly as rational as the naysayers claim, then their equilibrium strategy will be to return their liquidity once the experiment concludes, same as before (assuming these LPs don\u2019t have enough power to grim-trigger the pools, which I think is a fair assumption). Under a consequentialist framework, which seems to be the one most agreeable to economics, taking no action is an action itself. And if legal concerns are resolvable, the search for optimal fee switch obviously requires turning some on.  As I said, I am but a tourist, and I\u2019m likely missing context here. But if this experiment is tractable legally, the conversation should be on how it should be conducted, rather than if it should be conducted, due to the apparent lack of clarity that the community currently has regarding the effect of a fee switch.

I think we need to think carefully about conducting the expiriment in a way that minimizes spillovers for example we should do the experiment on an entire chain of pools, since bridging is expensive and can be considered enough of a moat to contain most of the spillovers. I would recommend turning on fees on Arbitrum system wide for all pools and all fee tiers. Going back to the casino starting to rake pools, imagine you own a chain of casinos. you want to figure out how raking will affect your attendance and the sale of ancillary stuff like hotel rooms and drinks/food. So instead of turning on rake on a few tables in every casino, you turn on the rake in a few casinos. As long as there is sufficient geographic distance, you will have contained the spillovers pretty well. I think markets are pretty localized here so for example it wouldn\u2019t make any sense to have a market for a bunch of arbitrum tokens exist on polygon or visa versa. ",

                    "content": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m from Fluidity and we have experimented with an alternative solution to this, which uses both the fee switch and our Transfer Reward Function (TRF). Fluidity works by rewarding users for spending their crypto, including swaps on DEXs. For every reward that is paid out, it is split between sender and receiver, which means that the Uniswap treasury would earn yield every time somebody performs a transaction on Uniswap using fluid assets. We have done some calculations with this, and they have shown that Fluidity would generate approximately the same amount of revenue for the three pools that have been chosen for the test run. Because of this, we propose a hybrid model that uses both fluid assets and the fee switch, where fluid assets would be used on pools that have lower LP fees and where it would otherwise become unprofitable for LPs to provide liquidity. For pools where this is not the case, the fee switch can be activated. With this, Uniswap would prevent liquidity leakage while still generating revenue for the treasury that can be used to incentivise token holders. It also discounts any increase in trading volume due to incentivising utility. For example, we can assume around 200,000 daily transactions on Uniswap V3. If Fluidity captures only 5% of this volume, we can estimate the mean daily revenue for the treasury to be $1,100, or $400,000 annually. If we compare this to the DAI-ETH-0.05% pool, it would have earned the treasury an average of $136 daily in the last 7 days. For some reason I can\u2019t include images in this post, but we have written an extensive blogpost on how this would work as well as this thread. This is first and foremost meant as a thought experiment and not an official proposal, nevertheless we would love to hear your thoughts on this! Edit: embedded links ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone! All being equal, a successful fee-switch would mean LPs help finance development costs, right? It would be good to have some a-priori statistics of LP impermanent loss, for different pairs, liquidity concentrations, time-scales up to 120 day max bins. Data should exist that if show LP are mostly in profit, would be good to know. If I read this right, with the fee switch turned-on: a small fee percentage on every pool Tx would go to a treasury fund. But what then of these funds? Can they be matched by the long term released UNI team funds to fund development? Although this might put buy pressure to Uni holders, it might be difficult to take for LPs that have encumbered significant impermanent loss on liquidation so though LPs might not be too deeply involved in this discussion, if loses are significant they may still want to pull-out of those LP pools, against the best interest of the protocol so caution seems good advice. Lastly: What about Pros/Cons of choosing either ETH/WBTC or WETH/WBTC pools in the pilot switch study? (For statistical purposes might be useful, since both are inextricably tied to \u201cbitcoin\u201d, the commodity!) ",

JIT LPs are making a decent return, as long as they manage to hedge their position properly, not sure how that would work, but my guess is that they manage, as they continue doing it. Running a system at a loss would be stupid. What would be really nice would have some JIT liquidity providers and automated arbitrage BOTs talking here, as they are generating most of the volume on DEXes from my understanding. ",

                    "content": "Hello guys, I have an idea, but first I need to tell that UNI only current utility which is governance is weak, it needs to capture value somehow, governance doesn\u2019t capture value, maybe it captures value In the treasury but not in the UNI hodlers pockets, so it makes sense the fee switch to actually give UNI hodlers the value they deserve, and giving fees to UNI hodlers, will increase the demand for the UNI token and give passive income to UNI hodlers. Instead of paying dividends to UNI hodlers, there are other ways to capture value for UNI hodlers, here\u2019s my idea: Essentially we need to align the interests of UNI hodlers and LP\u2019s and at the same time increase demand for the token. So, Instead of paying 0.25% to LP\u2019s, and 0.05% to UNI hodlers, we need to make LP\u2019s THE UNI hodlers, so how we do that? Don\u2019t take the option from lp\u2019s to keep earning the 0.3% from fees, give them two options:   first option is they will only earn 0.25% if they do not wish to hodl UNI tokens   second option is, they will be entitled to earn the full 0.3% If they hodl a portion of the capital they are putting to provide liquidity in UNI tokens   For example: If they put $1,000,000 of capital in ETH/USDC pair, to earn the full 0.3% of fees, they need to lock or stake 16.66% (1/6) of the 1M in UNI tokens, so in this example they will need $500,000 in ETH, $500,000 in USDC and if they want to earn the full 0.3% of that 1M, $166,600 in UNI they will need to lock, otherwise they will earn only 0.25% of the fees. This will inevitably create demand for the token and UNI hodlers and LP interests will be finally aligned, and also\u2026 this will be considered a utility and not a security under the eyes of the SEC.
