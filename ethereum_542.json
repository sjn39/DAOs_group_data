See zcash/zcash#3473 for more detailed...        Thanks to ETHGasStation for making me aware of this (via this tweet https://twitter.com/ETHGasStation/status/1065717539689414657) It could completely remove the need for a service like ETHGasStation and lead to better UX. Currently as @owocki states in this thread the whole gas thing is one of the biggest UX hurdles. Hope this post can help shining some more spotlight on this - so perhaps we can have it in the hard-fork after constantinople. ",
