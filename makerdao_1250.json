Organic DAI demand continues to rise, while most other stablecoins struggle   Lots of reasons to be optimistic about Maker amidst this bear. Onwards! ",

People are selling their crypto and turning to DAI to hold value while other coins go down.  Those who hold DAI are probably waiting for low enough prices to buy back into other coins.  What I\u2019m worried about is that usd rates becomes too attractive and DAI starts to get converted to usd.  That\u2019s when you start to lose demand forever.  Waiting anxiously for the ability to invest portions of the PSMs into bonds.  MKR has a special ability to profit during upturns and downturns.  We are very close to making it happen sustainably. ",

However I think Maker has gone a long way to streamline these over the last year or two, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had an issue with inefficient liquidations since the big crash in early 2020. Sophisticated players will be automating most of this process across DeFi, is my operating assumption. ",
