As you can see from the below table, DAI expenses were up at 3.2M in May, 0.6M lower than forecast. Forecasted expenses are expected to stabilize around 3.7M/month by June, a 44M annual run-rate (in line with what we forecasted in April). Oracle gas expenses continue to trend lower based on lower network congestion and OCU work to minimize gas expenses in a secular way. We have started proactive work around reducing burn-rates to mitigate the impact of the bear market on the protocol. The different initiatives are all captured with the bear-prep tag on the forums.

Adding in estimated annual Oracle gas costs of $6.8M (January actuals of $563K annualized), brings us to an annual cash burn rate of $42M, a $12.9M decrease from prior month\u2019s estimate. Over the past two weeks, we\u2019ve seen a significant decrease in Oracle gas expenses, driven by lower Gwei prices. During this period we\u2019ve been spending ~2 ETH per day, or about $150K/month at current ETH prices. This is too small to be a meaningful sample size and extrapolate off of, but quite positive to see as these cost savings drop directly to the bottom line. I\u2019ve included a tab for the MKR vesting schedule for every Core Unit and summarized the P&L impact incurred to date based on the vested price. To date this only covers Risk due to the 300 MKR retroactive payment approved by MKR holders, but this will increase by 4.1K additional MKR vesting by April, primarily driven by the PECU.

What is interesting about the article is that it only pertains to sales on opensea and fails to take into consideration that there are other platforms and the like, as well as that people may be staking their NFTs, or holding them for other reasons (such as the massive amount of airdrops people are receiving for holding- $APE, etc.). Most importantly, this article fails to discuss the trade volume going back to the summer of 2021, which was referred to as the summer of NFTs.  If I recall, subsequent to the summer the trade volume dipped only to sore back in the start of this year (as is evident from the chart in this article).  Seems to me the article is more FUD   ",

As you can see from the below table, DAI expenses increased to 2.5M in march (0.2M vs prior month), but 164k lower than had been forecasted 30 days ago. Our forecasted expenses are expected to increase to 3.5M/month by April, a 40M annual run-rate (4M higher run-rate vs what we forecasted in February). Estimated annual Oracle gas costs are 3.6M (vs 5.1M last month) based on a trailing three month average of 300K annualized (427K last month). This brings us to an annual cash burn rate of 43.6M, a 2.2M increase from prior month\u2019s estimate. Oracle gas expenses continue to trend lower based on lower network congestion and ahead of any volatility or pickup on mainnet, it is an encouraging sign to see these savings go straight to the bottom line. The MKR vesting schedule for every Core Unit and summarized the P&L impact incurred to date based on the vested price has also been included. The next major vesting cliff takes place in June, mostly for the Oracles team. Full year MKR compensation in DAI terms is estimated at 17.3M.

However, what @PonJerry has started doing is involving third-party partners who are cobranding the events and reducing the per event expense by sharing it with multiple sponsors. This will in effect reduce the projected run-rate for this CU as they are generating some amount of revenues to offset the expense of running the events. Eventually, the excess will be sent back to the surplus buffer. The above is now Events CU expenses, net of revenues including projected sponsor revenues for the next three months. ",

As you can see from the below table, our DAI expenses have increased to $2.4M in December, or a $29M annual run rate. Onboarding the Tech Ops and Strategic Finance increases our Dai burn by about $250K per month or $3M annualized. Over the next few months we expect expenses to increase by roughly $130K per month - if we extrapolate this out, we would finish 2022 with approximately $39.3M in workforce expenses. Adding in estimated annual Oracle costs of $15.6M (Q1 estimate from Nik, annualized), brings us to an annual cash burn rate of $54.9M. Gwei prices have increased thus far in 2022, offsetting some of the oracle cost favorability driven by lower ETH prices. If the ETH price recovers, our oracle expenses could be significantly higher than estimated. I\u2019ve included a tab for the MKR vesting schedule for every Core Unit and summarized the P&L impact incurred to date based on the vested price. To date this only covers Risk due to the 300 MKR retroactive payment approved by MKR holders, but this will increase by 700 additional MKR vesting at the end of March for the Risk Core Unit. Link is provided at the very bottom if anyone would like to view the full vesting schedule and spreadsheets.

Potentially with a separate operating expense line item specifically for oracle gas costs. Looking through the your forecast file it seems that oracle expenses take up ~80% (15MM) of the oracle CU budget, and would probably be on par with a line item such as \u201cSelling, general and administrative.\u201d I took a stab at what i think might make sense in a copy of your document.

                    "content": "All, Please see below for the April update of the monthly Core Unit expenses, including a forecast for the subsequent three months. As you can see from the below table, DAI expenses were flat at 2.5M in April, in line with forecasts. Forecasted expenses are expected to stabilize around 3.7M/month by May, a 44M annual run-rate (4M higher run-rate vs what we forecasted in March). Oracle gas expenses continue to trend lower based on lower network congestion and OCU work to minimize gas expenses in a secular way. Ahead of any volatility or pickup on mainnet, it is an encouraging sign to see these savings go straight to the bottom line. The MKR vesting schedule for every Core Unit and summarized the P&L impact incurred to date based on the vested price has also been included. The next major vesting cliff takes place in June, mostly for the Oracles team. Full year MKR compensation in DAI terms is estimated at 17.3M based on a 1,320 DAI market price. Link here if anyone would like to view the full vesting schedule and spreadsheets.  image1305\u00d7452 142 KB   image1232\u00d7211 39.7 KB   Thanks as usual to @Kayleigh for the help putting it together.

In the event of a phasing issue or off chain transactions we have backups from CUs to verify. There are two sources of forecast error or ongoing variance. Firstly, budgets have a tendency to undershoot. We might not necessarily welcome this eg if a core unit could invest in something worthwhile but doesn\u2019t it\u2019s a double miss for the protocol - once for not having invested and twice for not being able to invest those funds elsewhere. With the new MIP40 requirements we tried to tackle this by asking Budgets to be evaluated through an ROI lens, ie if someone pads their budget it should look like too much money for the stated objectives. If it appears to be too good to be true they should be challenged to invest more. Secondly, forecasts are evolving quickly with the ongoing macroeconomic context. Hopefully this source of variance should stabilize soon as core units get used to operating at a new baseline level. ",
