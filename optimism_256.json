I would like to first start by thanking the community for all of the feedback on our Governance Fund Observations post! After receiving your very encouraging feedback from the community, @raho and I have expanded upon our original post with a State of Optimism Governance Report. Our goal for the report was to create a formal, recurring reporting structure to provide transparency and analysis following each Season of the Optimism Governance Fund.  Optimism Governance Results1920\u00d71080 149 KB  Inspired by Optimism\u2019s culture, which emphasizes public goods, we are happy to release these without a paywall as we look to continue providing value-add services to the DAO. We\u2019d love to hear the community\u2019s feedback and we appreciate the collaborative nature and community of the Optimism Collective. To stay up-to-date with Optimism Governance, feel free to use Messari Governor which tracks and summarizes discussions and proposals across forums, Snapshot, and enables the ability to vote directly!
