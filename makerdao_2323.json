                    "content": "Hi everyone, Every month we highlight and feature the most interesting developments that have come out of the Maker community. This happens in the form of a tweetstorm, usually on the first Monday of the month. In the interest of archiving these monthly mentions, I\u2019ll be posting the monthly tweetstorm here in the forum. We do this to have a bit of fun with the Reddit community, and to highlight community developer creations, articles, threads, comments, and more. We hope you all enjoyed the month of July!  1/ Sometimes when I\u2019m sad I start to think about the @MakerDAO community members who did awesome things during the month of July, and then I\u2019m not sad anymore. This thread highlights some of the cool stuff that has come out of our community this month.  2/ The @InstaDApp guys, @sowmay_jain & @smykjain, released a Maker<>Compound bridge tool that allows anyone to refinance their debt from one protocol to the other. This made the ReFi market waaaay more efficient as we saw Dai supply plummet and the Compound Dai market grow.  3/ u/myetheroll released the (link: https://makerburn.com/) makerburn.com website, which contains some super neat numbers to keep an eye on as MKR is continually burned as a result from Stability Fees. 3500>   image905\u00d7605 74.3 KB   4/ Our community-driven Translation project has been a wonderful success. Early in the month contributors managed to translate 5 FAQs into 7 languages, resulting in 36 new pages of content in a handful of popular languages (and we have more on the way!)    reddit    r/MakerDAO - MakerDAO Translation Project 29 votes and 2 comments so far on Reddit       5/ In the land of Governance, the community has begun using a new forum (forum.makerdao.com). A ton of great discussions and threads have emerged already. It seems clear that this is a better home for Governance discussions than our old r/mkrgov subreddit.  6/ In the new forum, u/LongForWisdom has put together a handful of key threads: Governance at a Glance: Governance at a glance - Old Signaling Guidelines: Signaling Guidelines (Old) Meta: Coordinating Collateral Due Diligence: Meta: Coordinating Collateral Due Diligence  7/ Probably one of the most enjoyable pieces I\u2019ve read in the last couple of months was written by @HunterGebron, highlighting the fascinating parallel between MakerDAO and the old Land-Bank System in the American Colonies.    Medium \u2013 26 Aug 20    MakerDao: 18th Century Edition Land Banks, DAI, and Colonial Money Supply  Reading time: 9 min read        8/ A ton of contributors have come together to create their own USE DAI repository on GitHub. Excited to see this list grow! Use Dai  9/ @alexhevans and the peeps at @placeholdervc published a paper about the first public MakerDAO Risk Model. This is a huge and important step in the evolution of MakerDAO as a risk-managing organization. This model is already being iterated on!   static1.squarespace.com    Maker-Ratings.pdf 397.91 KB       10/ Lix did some analysis and presented a case for using on-chain order book data rather than direct on-chain trading data for determining the Dai Peg.     Estimating DAI/USD from the eth2dai order book instead of dex trades Risk       Throughout the history of DAI the vast majority of the volume has been through the oasis/eth2dai contract. This poses a problem when it comes to estimating the DAI/USD price using trades because it takes a few blocks to cancel a limit order. If ETH/USD moves against the maker, an arbitrager/market maker/metamask meatball will take it. In terms of DAI/USD, this trade looks like it occurred at an outlier price of +1.02/0.98 when compared to a centralized ETH/USD feed. This adds unnecessary noise t\u2026      11/ Someone created a chart on scout.cool showing the flow of Debt between Compound and Maker https://scout.cool/makerdao/mainnet/charts/5d27b638634bd61b44a7379f?startdate=2019-05-21&enddate=2019-08-06  12/ With help from several community members, we were able to soft-launch the first version of our Community Development Portal! A single domain where our community can find out about the projects and initiatives we have on the go! https://community-development.makerdao.com/  13/ With some turbulence at first, DAIHard, an \u201cUnkillable Crypto-Fiat Gateway\u201d, managed to relaunch. This project is a cool dive into some new Game-Theory for how to facilitate p2p fiat to crypto transactions. Use with caution!   Medium \u2013 20 May 19    DAIHard Game Theory How a Credible Threat of Burn can Power an Unstoppable Gateway to Crypto  Reading time: 10 min read        14/ As quickly as @PoolTogether_ launched their V1, it looks like an exciting V2 is coming after the conclusion of this last pool which is set to draw a winner on August 17th. Excited for the new features!    Medium \u2013 30 Jul 19    Next Steps for PoolTogether We\u2019re extremely happy with how the first version of PoolTogether was received! The first two pools had participation by over 500 unique\u2026  Reading time: 2 min read        15/ @Callisto_Audits decided to perform an audit on the Dai ERC-20 contract just for fun.   twitter.com    Callisto Audits @Callisto_Audits  #CallistoNetwork aims to make the #cryptocurrency ecosystem safer by improving the programmable #blockchain.

Two this month!     Weekly (almost) Narrative on MakerDAO - 02 July 2019 Governance and Risk Meetings       General During the course of the last week, the community held a polling vote where the winning proposal was to increase the rate by 100bps to 17.5%. At the time of this narrative, the executive vote looks unlikely to pass as market conditions (a DAI price that had sagged slightly below 1.0000 has since partially recovered without a rate change). Further, the underlying collateral has had some material price erosion during the same time-frame.  The overall price* of DAI has solidified around its\u2026         Weekly (almost) Narrative on MakerDAO - 28 July 2019 Governance and Risk Meetings       General:  During the course of the last week, the community held a polling vote where the winning proposal was to decrease the rate by 200bps to 18.5%. At the time of this narrative, the executive vote looks somewhat unlikely to pass as an edge case with the voting contract was discovered / stumbled upon. (Detailed summary may be found at An Explanation of Continuous Voting and the Peculiarities of the 7/26 Executive Stability Fee Vote ). That said, should the conditions that caused that edge ca\u2026      17/ Hot off the press, @santimentfeed and Block Analytica came together to produce an amazingly comprehensive MakerDAO Stats Dashboard. https://graphs.santiment.net/makerdao  18/ See @PrimozKordez\u2019s recap of the Dashboard in this tweet-thread:   twitter.com    Primoz Kordez @PrimozKordez    Presenting @MakerDAO Stats dashboard developed by Block Analitica and @santimentfeed tinyurl.com/y3ufhjs9.

As a major catalyst in the Maker community, Rune has never failed to get me excited for the vision we have and the progress we\u2019ve made so far.    Epicenter   Epicenter The conversation starts at the Epicenter       20/ Our community is awesome. Deal with it.  ",
