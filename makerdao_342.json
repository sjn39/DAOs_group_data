FratDAO pledge @cap_asw sent ~0.152 MKR to MCD ESM This represents the first deposit into the emergency shutdown contract ever recorded. As acting FratDAO Prez \u2013 I write to you to propose either of the paths outlined as immediate remedies to a grave risk.   A drastic increase of MKR needed to initiate an emergency shutdown.   A formal recommendation (from a certain governance community member) re: a more humorous alternative contract to receive financial hazing deposits.   As financial hazing (think frat findom) ramps up with incoming pledge classes, we expect the 50k MKR threshold to be reached in early Q1 2022 (could be much sooner idk). While the Maker governance community would act to redeploy in such an event (see example framework outlined outlined ) \u2013 the ensuing network disruption would create a profit opportunity for bad actors in the space (read: Nancy Pelosi). FratDAO financial hazing deposits would also be disrupted. FratDAO is committed to remaining a beacon of virtue \u2013 we urge the Maker governance community to consider our recommendations. In the bonds of brotherhood. -0xThad ",
