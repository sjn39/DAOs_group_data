These Kudos are Quadratic lands themed - We envision the quadratic lands as a promised land; a place where everyones preferences for public goods are optimally expressed. To me this looks like a place where  There are numerous opportunities to create financial sovereignty while working side-by-side with people who share similar values. Individuals have sovereignty to make their own choices, but incentives are aligned for cooperation that generates both individual and community benefit. The economic infrastructure is a set of economic games with transparent rules that cannot be changed on us. Because of composability of blockchain-based systems, the surface area of opportunity is growing exponentially as the tools compound upon each other.  Anyway, the point is that we\u2019re celebrating the QL by creating some NFTs that are QL themed  Click here to browse the QL Kudos, and I\u2019ve even taken the liberty of creating an NFT airdrop for the first 100 visitors to this community hangout.  Click the kudos below to partcipate.  ",

Kudos are pretty cool concept, I minted one so far and was planning to make way more, even animated, though I didn\u2019t got rewarded for the 100 ones minted because the application form somehow defaulted to gitcoin address, even though I pasted my address.
