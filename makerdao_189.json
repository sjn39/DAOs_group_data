Dai on Different Networks: The Dashboard   Highlights The bridges are packed and the liquidity mining rewards are worth a double-take. I think it\u2019s safe to say DeFi Fall is upon us. Which brings us to this week\u2019s theme: bridging.  Bridging is the new cool. Liquidity mining incentives and weekly protocol drops are dragging users from chain to chain. The flavors of the month are Avalanche and Fantom, and the bridge of choice has been AnySwap. The bridge now has over 5bil in TVL with 3.9bil headed towards the Fantom network. The Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge also been seeing its fair share of volume, with over 253 million Dai now held in its contract.  Fantom\u2019s become very active, very quickly. The Geist money-market surprise-launched on October 3rd before locking up over 2bil in assets in under a day. That growth has slowed but it hasn\u2019t stopped, with its actualized TVL now seated at a comfy 7.3bil. With strong incentive offerings for both Dai deposits and borrows, the protocol has managed to lock in around 213 million Dai. Geist, as well as the farming protocols Curve, SpookSwap, and SCREAM drove around 45 million Dai to the network last week, pushing the Dai circulating on the chain to over 320 million - or around 4.5% of Dai\u2019s total supply.  Avalanche is trending back up. An underwhelming launch of the Avalanche Rush liquidity mining program saw users migrate to Fantom in droves, but the trend has reversed and humble farmers are once again migrating back to the chain. Aave is the money market of choice, with over 250 million in Dai locked into its contract. Through the protocol, users have generated around 446 million in leveraged Dai. Over 266 million Dai now lives on the chain or 3.78% of Dai\u2019s total supply.

To start, here\u2019s a brief rundown of Avalanche\u2019s three-chain network:  The Contract (C-Chain) chain is EVM compliant, allowing devs to copy/paste projects and enabling easier bridging for end-users. Platform (P-Chain) chain controls validators and creates \u201csubnets\u201d or sharded side-chains. The Exchange (X-Chain) chain is used for the creation and exchange of assets.  We\u2019ll be focusing on the C-Chain, where nearly all the network\u2019s current Dapps are housed.

                    "content": "This is getting so long I am going to have to take some time to read. You need a DAI at a glance - 1 pager to go with this that has the salient highlights. I still am wanting to just see a $$ DAI went to, and gone from in a list of largest gainer to 0 and 0 to largest loser. I see you pointed out about \u2018bridges\u2019     alec:   Bridging is the new cool. Liquidity mining incentives and weekly protocol drops are dragging users from chain to chain.   Something to think about because I see Celo warming up to basically provide bridging functionality between multiple networks. I really would like to hear anyone from Protocol Engineering, Growth, whomever chime in on an issue I see cropping up which may lead to an opportunity for Maker. Bridges if you anticipate a N2N (network 2 network) topology will always require 2*N the DAI funds to exist for N DAI funds to move from one network to the next.    Lets say we want to have funds to move 1000 DAI in a single bridge that covers K networks. This is going to mean K*1000DAI just for 1000 DAI to move from one network to another so the liquidity profile will look like 1000 1000 \u2026 \u2026 1000 0 2000 1000 One network will have 2000 in liquidity which now can only move to 1 of the K-1 other networks etc. after only 1000 DAI moves.   Not very capital efficient. This is if we only have one protocol bridge, this gets worse if we have 3 bridges trying to supply 1000 DAI to all K networks. Here are the questions. Is the bridge liquidity bi-liquid.  Meaning instead of one protocol having 1000 1000 \u2026 \u2026 1000 on each network does each protocol have to have 1000-1000 (on each network pair due to the fact that bridging is a cross network atomic swap). Implications of bridges between networks being limited to cross network atomic swaps is that liquidity to provide these 1000DAI on each side of K networks becomes 2Kliquidity vs K*liquidity. Those numbers are for a single bridge.  What if there are multiple bridges B? Then we end up with liquidity requirements that scale at BKliquidity. What this means is that even if we evenly distribute existing DAI the average DAI available on each side of a bridge is going to look like MINTED_DAI/B*K.  Say we have 10 networks and 3 bridge players trying to bridge all of them 6B/30 = 200M/bridge side.    But this assumes all DAI is available.   If DAI available for bridging is only like 10-20% this number drops to 20-40M/bridge side. Which as a problem begs a solution that only Maker might be able to provide.   Since DAI would live in these bridge contracts and would never be available to anyone unless they provide DAI on another side of a bridge isn\u2019t Maker uniquely suited to run DAI bridges everywhere? Because DAI sitting in these bridge contracts basically makes no claim on the system.  Maker in principle could mint this DAI unbacked to be used to make these bridges highly liquid in DAI. By running the exclusive DAI bridges Maker could reduce bridging fees across these network to make DAI cheap and liquid.  All the protocol has to do is come up with the bridging technology that protects the unbacked DAI in these contracts (or figures a good way for how to deal with this).  Should there be reason to limit DAI in these contracts then also works with some bridging keepers to basically cycle the DAI as necessary to \u2018rebalance\u2019 the bridges should there be reasons to only have so much DAI liquidity in these things. Is there a real opportunity here or is Maker still stuck under the security assumptions of the bridging network to be obligated to use backed vs. unbacked DAI on these networks? Is there a solution to this problem that can be a opportunity uniquely suited to Maker solving? ",

                    "content": " Dai on Different Networks #14  If you missed last week\u2019s update, here\u2019s a link to Dai on Different Networks #13.  Dai on Different Networks: The Dashboard (soft-launch)  I created a dashboard to track some of the stats I\u2019ve been reporting in real-time. Dune Analytics currently tracks Ethereum and Polygon proficiently but databases for the other L1s and L2s are limited or non-existent; that said, more are being added every week. As more information becomes available this dashboard will be updated! With the dashboard now available, we\u2019ve made some changes to the format; namely, an extension of the highlight section and a pivot to focus on the week\u2019s anomalies. Hopefully, this format will prove to be a more valuable week-to-week format. As always - we\u2019re open to any all and suggestions.  Now, on to the meat and potatoes.  Highlights DeFi Summer is transitioning nicely into DeFi Fall - this time driven by absurd multi-chain liquidity mining programs. In response, humble farmers are hopping from chain to chain in search of fertile yields. And therein lies our theme of the week (and likely the month): liquidity mining.  Avalanche saw a lot of action last week after the announcement of a ~$700 million incentive program the AVAX team calls Avalanche Rush. That hype reached a peak over the weekend after the release of the long-awaited Aave and Curve protocols.  The news saw another ~20 million Dai flood the Avalanche network, now totaling a strong 211 million circulating Dai. Through BenQi and now Aave, over 394 million interest-bearing Dai are being leveraged on the chain - with the majority held in Curve and Trader Joe.   Fantom has seen peaks and valleys over the past month, but this past week was a big one.   Geist Finance launched over the weekend and saw its TVL rise from around 17k to over 2bil in 24 hours. This amounted to around 131k in Dai bridged to Fantom, or a 134% increase in circulating Dai.   Rollup szn is still underway, though some steam was lost as money moved to Avalanche, Terra, and Fantom.  Optimism and Arbitrum saw a combined 109% increase in circulating Dai or just over 10 million Dai. Optimism\u2019s ecosystem is still a little sparse and is primarily controlled by Synthetix and Uniswap. Arbitrum\u2019s top projects include multi-chain staples like Curve, Sushiswap, and Abracadabra (MIM).   Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  915\u00d7378 55.1 KB  Source This week saw a ton of chain-to-chain movement, and it shows, as Dai in bridges and EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) increased by a combined 2.7%.

To start, here\u2019s a brief rundown of Avalanche\u2019s three-chain network:  The Contract (C-Chain) chain is EVM compliant, allowing devs to copy/paste projects and enabling easier bridging for end-users. Platform (P-Chain) chain controls validators and creates \u201csubnets\u201d or sharded side-chains. The Exchange (X-Chain) chain is used for the creation and exchange of assets.  We\u2019ll be focusing on the C-Chain, where nearly all the network\u2019s current Dapps are housed.

Conceptually what I want to see is where the DAI moved to, and where it moved from. I am not sure if the 100% graph works for me here because while I think % of cap is important also seeing the actual amounts help a bit.   Don\u2019t get me wrong if you had amounts I\u2019d be the first person saying I want to see MC as a % of total too. So maybe when it comes to winners and losers list maybe these should be in % MC? I mean 20M or 100M may seem like a lot but this is what .3% and 1.5% respectively. So tables and graphs of amounts in % of MC and $$ might also be useful. I can look for a chart but I think it is also important to state how much total DAI there is and whether this increased or decreased over the week. I keep wondering as well if the collateral backing DAI is important when it comes to the state of DAI but maybe this is a risk anaysis report thing so out of your domain. Something like N DAI outstanding this week + some reasonable high level breakdown into ETH, wBTC, rest with amount of DAI borrowed and average vault CR.   idk maybe this is a risk/vault analytics thing.   I just think it would be nice to have with the State of DAI report\u2026 ",

                    "content": " Dai on Different Networks #16  If you missed last week\u2019s update, here\u2019s a link to Dai on Different Networks #15. Dai on Different Networks: The Dashboard  Highlights DeFi Fall\u2019s been surprisingly green, an uptrend that saw another exodus of humble liquidity miners chasing gains. So, at this point, it\u2019s settled - our theme for the month: liquidity mining and bridging.  Bridging The Avalanche and Fantom chains have had a nice back-and-forth as new platforms continue to launch with shiny, new APY\u2019s. This week\u2019s top mover was the Avalanche chain, which utilizes the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge. The bridge now holds around 318 million Dai or 4.24% of the total supply. Despite the downtick, the AnySwap Bridge is still one of the largest off-chain Dai holders with over 270 million in locked Dai. As discussed in last week\u2019s thread, in a multi-chain world - layer-2 solutions, bridge security, and Dai liquidity are topics worth further exploring. I\u2019m working on a separate post to dive into this further.  Avalanche The Avalanche Rush liquidity mining program saw an underwhelming launch, but Trader Joe flipped the script. The farming protocol launched its incentive rewards early last week, and in response, another 61 million Dai moved to AVAX. Aave is still Avalanche\u2019s money market of choice, with nearly 141 million Dai locked into its contract - and through the protocol, users have generated around 514 million in leveraged Dai. Over 266 million Dai now lives on the chain or 3.78% of the total supply.  Fantom The Geist money-market surprise-launched on October 5th before locking up over 2bil in assets in under a day, but as towering APY\u2019s have toppled back to earth, that growth has finally stalled. That said, the protocol still has over 128 million Dai locked in its contract, and the recent release of a Geist 3pool (gDAI-gUSDC-gUSDT) on Curve could see that number rebound. Geist\u2019s swift rise and decline can also be attributed to the rapid growth of the Fantom ecosystem as a whole:   SCREAM, a competing money market, has seen its TVL shoot to around 392 million with over 25 million in Dai. An Aave Governance poll that recently passed in support of a Fantom launch.  After a week of slight decline, Fantom currently holds over 250 million Dai or around 3.4% of the total supply.  Overview  Where is my Dai (General)  overview913\u00d7370 53.1 KB  Source Recent weeks have seen a shift in dominance from the \u2018Other\u2019 category in favor of DEXs, Lending protocols, and good old-fashioned cold storage.
