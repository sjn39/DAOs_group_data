EIP-1 states:   Security Considerations - All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status \u201cFinal\u201d without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.   The reviewers here I believe predominantly means those who are very familiar with the Ethereum RPC system. ",
