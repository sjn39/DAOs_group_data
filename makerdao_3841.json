I seems none of the deposit transactions were even sent to the blockchain in the first palce. I was able to deposit from Metamask but that\u2019s only an account that I use as a hot wallet, now I need to transfer the deposited DAI back to my Ledger, but the deposited DAI don\u2019t show up on Metamask nor the block explorer, only on oasis.app. ",
