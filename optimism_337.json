We\u2019re FranklinDAO/Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter), a leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently has over 50 members and we\u2019re expecting many more in the semesters to come! We have committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business Development, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, Maker, etc. Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet. We\u2019d love to be your $OP delegate as many of us have been closely following Optimism for a while now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3. My view on the Optimistic Vision: \u201cTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\u201d We couldn\u2019t have put it better ourselves. The ushering in of a new digital democratic governance used to drive rapid and sustained growth is one that resonates well with us, and something we entirely support! Languages I speak and write: The member spearheading the Optimism governance initiative (@juanbugeth on twitter) is fluent in English and Chinese. However, our club members\u2019 come from some of the most diverse countries in the world. Pretty much all of these languages  are accounted for. Thanks to everyone for starting this communication thread style. We will be following this style in the future as well to effectively voice our reasoning and opinions for our votes. ",
