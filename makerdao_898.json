We received some feedback back then and now, based on those and some ideas we think might improve user experience we\u2019ve pushed the first Forum Explorer update.  forum-explorer1149\u00d7872 64.2 KB   What\u2019s changed  User group filters: you can now filter topics not only by their category or tags but also by those created from members of a specific group (e.g. topics created by Recognized Delegates or those created by members of the GovAlpha CU). You can find these user group filters at the end of the sidebar, after the tag filters. Time filters: we added support for Custom Filters to only display topics created X amount of days/weeks/months ago up to now. UI/UX changes: we moved the Custom Filters to the top of the sidebar to unify the Explorer navigation and to simplify the plugin layout, we now only have two columns, one for navigation and one for results.   Feedback As always feel free to leave any feedback if there\u2019s something you think would be useful we added or changed  ",

Thanks to some dedication and hard work from @hernandoagf, we\u2019re now in a position to share the first of these. TL;DR: The explorer view makes it easier to browse forum content through accessible filter mechanisms and configurable queries. Screenshot below. Link here.  1165\u00d7896 56.5 KB  The plugin is based on the open-source docs plugin for discourse, with a few minor additions that help to make it more flexible and suited to MakerDAO\u2019s use case.  Main features  Forum admins can create custom queries complete with titles and descriptions as seen at the top of the page. This lets us surface key forum content more effectively than with the default tools. Users can apply tag and category filters using the sidebar at the left, allowing more natural exploration and discoverability of relevant content. Search / filter boxes for posts, tags and categories within this UI to further aid navigation to relevant content.  The Explorer can be accessed via the menu bar here:  1195\u00d7101 3.9 KB   Feedback Any feedback you can give us would be super useful as there\u2019s potentially quite a lot we can do with this UI, and the query structure. Specifically:  What queries do you think you would find most useful? Is there anything you find unintuitive or confusing about this UI? Are there additional query criteria you\u2019d like to see? (Currently supports tags and categories.) Are you noticing any bugs while using the Explorer?  ",
