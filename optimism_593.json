An essential part of CIAN Protocol\u2019s growth strategy is to build tools and strategies around LSD related use cases and yield opportunities. In this project, CIAN creates an EARN platform on Optimism which offers users the ability to earn yield derived from the ETH LSD strategies, starting from recursive loops utilizing Aave v3.  Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:   Our expectation of CIAN\u2019s success on Optimism stems from CIAN\u2019s notable growth and contribution on Avalanche and Polygon, where CIAN were first deployed. Shortly after the inception, CIAN grew into the largest LSD-related strategy and automation tooling provider on both networks, contributing about $30m TVL to the networks. By far almost 100% of maticX on AAVE Polygon is supplied through CIAN Protocol.   As the largest yield source and the fastest growing asset class in DeFi, ETH LSDs have yet quite limited reach to Layer 2s. CIAN\u2019s successful experience in accelerating the growth of early-stage LSD ecosystem on a network eg. avalanche, polygon will contribute to the bootstrap of ETH LSD ecosystem on Optimism as well as CIAN\u2019s own growth in the ecosystem.   CIAN is working closely with the core team of major ETH liquid staking service providers incl. LIDO, Rocket Pool etc. to devise LSD based yield strategies, automation tools and structured products. Optimism dedicated cooperation with LSD partners is under discussion, which will provide CIAN with a competitive edge on Optimism.   CIAN has agreed with a number of leading crypto asset management platforms eg. Matrix Port, centralized exchanges eg. OKX and large wallets for the cooperation in yield strategies. To secure our success in Optimism\u2019s ecosystem, we are committed to directing a substantial part of the strategy participants and assets from the partners to the OP ecosystem.    How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:   Unique addresses (from our monitoring system, could also be verified through Dune Analytics): 3435  TVL (Defillama): $30M   How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: This grant will go towards (as incentives) supporting CIAN to grow the ETH-LSD recursive strategy implemented on OP (currently in Beta testing) to generate delta-neutral yield on the following assets:   Network Tokens - ETH, wBTC, OP. With  Lido\u2019s potential incentive on AAVE Optimism AAVE\u2019s potential Uoptimal optimization for ETH Optimism\u2019s lower gas cost,  CIAN\u2019s OP optimized ETH-wstETH recursive strategy stands a good chance of providing competitive APY compared to similar strategy implemented on ETH mainnet. With extra 3%-4% OP incentives, we expect to bring considerable ETH investors from ETH mainnet.   LSD:  wstETH - same as above rETH - to be deployed when rETH is listed on any of the mainstream lending protocols on OP. Only rETH holders are targeted in this strategy considering the lower staking yield from Rocket Pool compared to Lido. cbETH holders - same as rETH    USD stable coins - DAI, USDC, USDT   Further, the grant will provide us with better chance of attracting non-DeFi users to OP ecosystem from CIAN\u2019s wallet partners and centralized partners eg. OKX, Matrix Port etc\u2026  Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Plz. refer to our answer to the previous question.  How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: Long-term interaction is expected.   From both implementation cost perspective and protocol growth perspective, CIAN primarily implements long-term sustainable yield strategies that could accommodate large capital/assets. ETH-LSD recursive strategy meets both requirements in that:  Along with the growth of ETH LSDs, dynamic balances will always be reached between ETH\u2018s borrow rate VS LSD\u2019s staking yield, leaving a small gap between the 2 rates because ETH\u2019s borrow rate is primarily determined by the demand of ETH-LSD recursive strategy. The strategy is therefore long-term viable. LSD will stay as the largest yield source in DeFi for quite some time, rendering this strategy one of the largest home to the capital.    To gain and maintain the leading position, it\u2019s in CIAN\u2019s interest to keep and grow its user base on OP. CIAN strives for this through new strategies and structured products. An example is CIAN\u2019s next strategy will boost the yield from the LSD recursive strategy with a quasi delta-neutral option strategy.    Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: [1] Website: [2] Twitter: [3] Discord/Discourse/Community: [4] Github: [5] [6] [7] Technical/Economic Documentation: [8] Other: [9] [10]   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):   Unique addresses (from our monitoring system, could also be verified through Dune Analytics): 3435  TVL (Defillama): $30M   Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: Instadapp, not on Optimism  Please link to code audits (if any): [11]   Team   Who are your founders?: Luffy  What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? CIAN\u2019s core team is an international group of ~ 30 ppl with 4 year + experience in both crypto arbitraging strategies (CeFi & DeFi) and blockchain dev. The team is a balanced composition of DeFi researchers, DeFi strategy designers, experienced blockchain dev, product designers and marketing/BD staff. The team has been running one of the earliest DeFi arbitrage funds since the beginning of 2020 (doing arb across CeFi & DeFi initially). The initial idea of CIAN was to bring to the DeFi community a set of decentralized blockchain automation tools that we built internally for our own DeFi funds. The team has strong experience and a proven track record in:  building and running decentralized automation for DeFi strategies. driving early-stage LSD ecosystem within a DeFi ecosystem  In recognition of the team\u2019s quality, multiple grants have been awarded to the team incl. AAVE grant.  Is this your first Web3 project?: No  If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.):  An ETH POS statistics website: [12] A number of internal automation tools for DeFi arbitrage; repository could be provided upon request    Grant Request   What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 150K OP  How do you justify the size of the grant?: This grant will go towards (as incentives) helping CIAN grow the ETH-LSD recursive strategy implemented on OP to $30m deposits in the course of 6 months. Because of the recursive nature of the strategy, this $30m in CIAN\u2019s vault will effectively bring $210m assets ($120m ETH, $90m other assets incl. wstETH, other ETH LSDs, wbtc, stable coins) to the Optimism network from mainnet through AAVE OP. 150K OP grant is approximately worth $375K. Direct distribution of the grant to $30m over 6 months leads to an average increase of 2.49% APY to the strategy APY, which coupled with LIDO\u2019s incentive has a good chance of diverting a good amount of ETH and other assets from ETH Mainnet to Optimism network. Considering the total assets to be brought onto Optimism by the strategy is worth $210m, a grant of $375K implies an average increase of 0.43% APY is applied to effectively attract $210m. Note: to maximize the effect of the grants, we will distribute the incentives unevenly across different assets and periods.   Roadmap and Distribution Plan   Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:   Considering the limited ETH supply on AAVE OP atm, we will divide the distribution into 2 3-month periods.The length of each period is subject to change depending on how fast ETH supply and ETH Uoptimal increase on AAVE.   In period 1,  We will start with higher APY incentives (+10%) to quickly attract initial volume Once deposits reaches $10m, we will drop the incentive gradually to 2% Incentive APY stays at around 2% until ETH supply on AAVE builds up to the point where new space is opened for vault deposits. Period 1 is done.    In period 2, we follow the similar distribution strategy as in period 1.   In view of ETH\u2019s distinguished value in this strategy and in the LSD ecosystem in general, 75% of the incentives will be allocated to ETH depositors, 25% to other token depositors.   The distribution will be adjusted on a weekly basis to cope with the evolution of the OP ecosystem.    How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the [no sale rule here 5]): 100% of the grants will go to user incentives to encourage vault participation since we believe increased APY appeals best to mainnet participants of the similar strategies.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: 6 months since the grant is awarded.  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: CIAN Protocol hopes to build a close working relationship with the Optimism community that leads to long term collaboration. Members of CIAN Protocol are also able to participate in any community meeting or other media communication events to discuss any project related topics.   Milestone #1 - grow the wstETH/ETH recursive strategy vault from $0 to $15m deposits (roughly $45m TVL), with 50K -75K OP incentives within 3 months (distribution period 1) after the grant is awarded. This should effectively create $30m ETH borrowing demands and push the wstETH supply on AAVE by over $45m (currently below $300K).   Milestone #2 - keep the wstETH/ETH vault size around/above $15m (roughly $45m TVL) with OP incentives being lowered to 2% APY before it\u2019s raised again in the distribution period 2 for next wave of growth.   Milestone #3 - grow the wstETH/ETH based stable coin vault, btc vault, LSD vault from $0 to $5m deposits (roughly $15m TVL) collectively, with 25K OP incentives within 2 months after the vaults are deployed. This should effectively create another $10m ETH borrowing demands and push the wstETH supply on AAVE by another $15m or more.   Milestone #4 - $25m (roughly $75m TVL) deposits for ETH/wstETH vault within 3 months after $15m deposits is reached, with no more than 50K OP incentives.   Milestone #5 - keep the TVL of the recursive strategy grow organically beyond $30m to $40m without OP incentives 2 months after the incentive distribution is finished.    Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Critical Milestone #1 - deploy wstETH/ETH vault on Optimism no later than 1/4/2023 Critical Milestone #2 - deploy wstETH/ETH based stable coin strategy vault on Optimism before 11/4/2023 Critical Milestone #3 - deploy wstETH/ETH based btc strategy vault on Optimism before 14/4/2023 Critical Milestone #4 - reach $15m deposits (= $45m TVL) in the strategy vaults on Optimism with the support of no more than 70K OP incentives before 1/7/2023   If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?:   A crucial result of CIAN\u2019s token distribution should be accelerated growth of LSD ecosystem on Optimism, which should then provide a good APY (compared to ETH mainnet) to recursive strategy on its own, especially considering that Optimism\u2019s lower network cost entails more frequent position management.   To gain and maintain the leading position, it\u2019s in CIAN\u2019s interest to keep and grow its user base on OP. CIAN strives for this through new strategies and structured products. An example is CIAN\u2019s next strategy will boost the yield from the LSD recursive strategy with a quasi delta-neutral option strategy.

If so how?: Yes.  We are well positioned to catalyzing the growth of infant LSD ecosystem on Optimism based on CIAN\u2019s successful experience in accelerating the growth of early-stage LSD ecosystem on other networks. Alongside strategy vaults, CIAN provides automation tools, which facilitates operations on Optimism much better than on ETH mainnet due to lower gas cost.   Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: This project is set to bring $210m assets ($120m ETH, $90m other assets incl. wstETH, other ETH LSDs, wbtc, stable coins) from ETH mainnet to Optimism network along with at least thousands of investors.  Is your project Optimism Native?: No   Confirmations   I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes  I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined [here]:[Yes/No]:Yes   Reference   [1] : https://cian.app [2]: https://cian.app [3]: https://twitter.com/CIAN_protocol [4]: CIAN [5]: GitHub - cian-ai/cian-protocol [6]: GitHub - cian-ai/cian-protocol-polygon [7]: GitHub - cian-ai/cian-protocol-ethereum [8]: https://docs.cian.app/ [9]: https://twitter.com/Luffy_He [10]: https://twitter.com/Castick7 [11]: Audit Report - CIAN [12]: http://postat.xyz/   ",

With the largest LSD-related strategy and automation tooling provider on both networks, contributing about $30m TVL to the networks, it is evident that CIAN has a good understanding of the ecosystem and user needs. The team\u2019s cooperation with major ETH liquid staking service providers, including LIDO and Rocket Pool, is a strong indication of their commitment to the project\u2019s success. CIAN\u2019s focus on optimizing its ETH-LSD recursive strategy for assets such as Network Tokens (ETH, wBTC, OP), wstETH, rETH, and USD stable coins is commendable. CIAN\u2019s plan to attract non-DeFi users to the OP ecosystem from CIAN\u2019s wallet partners and centralized partners, including OKX and Matrix Port, is an excellent strategy for expanding the user base on the platform. The team\u2019s long-term approach to sustainable yield strategies that can accommodate large capital/assets shows their commitment to the project\u2019s growth and success. Overall, the CIAN Protocol\u2019s project on Optimism is a promising initiative that can significantly contribute to the growth and success of the DeFi ecosystem. With a strong team and an excellent strategy, CIAN is poised for success, and the grant will undoubtedly help accelerate the project\u2019s progress. Super excited for this! #OPTIMISITC AF ",

For clarification, let me also provide our understanding on some of your comments.     Michael:  size of this grant seems large given the # of users and current stage of the project   We reduced it to 150K OP following your advice.     Michael:  While it\u2019s true that recursive TVL numbers may be bigger, looped TVL that is incentivized through outside means generally should be discounted relative to non-looped TVL.   We didn\u2019t calculate the incentive APY based on LTV. We know it\u2019s leveraged, so the additional incentive 3.32% (now reduced to 2.49%) is calculated for user\u2019s deposits, not LTV.     Michael:  If the wstETH/ETH vault is not yet deployed at the time of the first grant distribution, what is the planned use of the initial 50k $OP?   Great question, that helped us improve our milestones and critical milestones (check the new one plz.). To be clear - we bear all the dev and auditing cost, all grants go towards users. ",

It provides the digital infrastructure for token management. What today is done mostly manually in the asset management world (i.e. investment funds, index funds, and so on) can be done on-chain, with real time tracking of portfolio tokens and users positions\u2019 accounting, in a transparent and publicly verifiable way. Rigoblock is a fully open source and free to use smart contracts protocol that facilitates the interaction with DeFi applications by abstracting token allowances and makes it safer by removing exposure to external smart contract vulnerability risks. Rigoblock is multi-chain, live on Optimism since November 2022. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: Rigoblock improves a user\u2019s Dapp UX by removing the number of necessary transactions and removing the risk that a vulnerability in an external Dapp would result in a loss of tokens for the wallet. How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: Rigoblock V2 has about 40 smart pools, Rigoblock V3 about 10. While these are not exciting numbers, we haven\u2019t started promoting V3 yet. TVL is currently aroung 500k USD, we are working on displaying these figures on a public dashboard. Target users are specialized DeFi degens, therefore our target audience is in the order of thousands (or tens of thousands) as opposed to hundreds of thousands (or millions) of smaller users. How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: the biggest hurdle we are facing is in explaining why a user should use a smart pool instead of an EOA. We are aiming at using the distribution as funnel for user acquisition, where users are expected to keep using the platform even after the expiration of the program because of ease of use and ongoing Rigoblock incentives.  Promotion of program to public channels, praising benefits of Optimism L2 L1 users bridge to Optimism and create a smart pool User mints smart pool tokens with own tokens and activates GRG staking User receives GRG rewards and OP rewards at each epoch (2 weeks) User keeps receiving GRG staking rewards even after OP program ends.  The value added to an Optimism user is that a users\u2019 wallet, which generally won\u2019t generate yield, will generate yield in terms of GRG staking rewards, which is a win-win for the user and the protocol. Actors in the Rigoblock ecosystem are encouraged to take an active role, as passive GRG holders do not have any staking rewards nor governance benefits. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: we are aiming mostly at attracting Ethereum L1 users, where the protocol already counts around 500k USD TVL. However, even Optimism users will be able to obtain the same benefits by using Rigoblock . We also want to promote the program to L1 users who are looking to reduce transaction cost for swaps. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: we expect the users to keep using Rigoblock on Optimism even after the program comes to its end. Rigoblock has a continuous rewards program that will keep rewarding users in a competitive way. GRG smart pools compete for GRG stake in order to maximize their staking rewards. After the end of the OP program, users will find that they can earn a yield on their tokens by either staking GRG or by having GRG holders stake to their pool. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: live app  Website: https://rigoblock.com  Twitter: @RigoBlock  Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord  Github: https://github.com/RigoBlock  Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.rigoblock.com/  Other: https://app.rigoblock.com/#/smart-pool/{smartpooladdress} for smart pool data query, {smartpooladdress} must be changed with the target smart pool address  Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  40 V2 pools: RigoBlock   One of the top staking pools on the 0x staking system More than $50MM volume generated by Rigoblock liquidity on 0x on Ethereum mainnet. Around 500k USD TVL between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon, for the great part on Ethereum  Displaying V3 metrics on a public dashboard is work in progress. The data listed here is the result of onchain activity, i.e. transactions. Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: https://safe.global/ (on Optimism) https://enzyme.finance/ (not on Optimism) While safe.global is a multisig wallet, the Rigoblock tech is very similar and the products can target the same audience, i.e. project treasuries. Compared to safe.global, Rigoblock guarantees that only protocols pre-approved by the Rigoblock governance may be used by a smart pool. Compared to enzyme, Rigoblock pools are highly efficient in terms of gas cost for running a transaction. A swap on Rigoblock is at least 50% less expensive in terms of gas used. The creation of a Rigoblock pool, furthermore, is 90% less expensive than an enzyme vault. Pool minting, furthermore, is more than 80% cheaper than enzyme. Compared to both, Rigoblock guarantees that the smart pool is not exposed to external smart contract risk. Please link to code audits (if any): An audit has not been produced yet. However, all smart contracts have full test coverage, with overall >99% test coverage and 100% protocol test coverage.  Verifiable on coveralls Team Who are your founders?: Gabriele Rigo Linkedin profile What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? I have founded the project in 2016, built a team, successfully raised funds for the project and fully delivered what had been promised. In 2019 I had to let the other members of the team go because of lack of funds. After a critical vulnerability in Rigoblock V2 was exploited in early 2022, I rewrote the protocol and deployed a new interface and documentation. Rigoblock has constantly innovated, being the first onchain protocol connected to a Dex in 2019. I have earned a seat on the 0x DAO. While Rigoblock\u2019s success has so far been very disappointing, I strongly believe that the product creates value for its users. Is this your first Web3 project?: Yes. However, I recently launched a framework for upgradable governance, which is used by Rigoblock but can be leveraged by anyone (free and open source). If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): decentralized governance github link Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 25K OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: the size of the grant is relatively small as the Rigoblock TVL does not justify a much bigger OP distribution at the moment. If the cost/impact ratio is taken into consideration, I believe the program has good chance of attracting multiples in TVL which will not leave Optimism once the program ends. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here ): OP tokens will be distributed to Rigoblock pools based on their GRG staking rewards, augmenting the pools\u2019 rewards. Allocated tokens will be split by epoch (each Rigoblock epoch is 2 weeks long) and distributed to the pools on top of their GRG staking reward. We will distribute the allocated OP pro-rata to each smart pool based on the GRG staking rewards. While GRG staking rewards are accrued both by smart pools and stakers, the OP experiment distribution will only be directed to smart pools. After the end of each Rigoblock epoch, each pool is finalized and its reward paid to its pool operator. We will use a pool\u2019s staking reward as a % of the total pools\u2019 staking rewards as the % allocation of the OP distribution. As can be seen here (github) a pool\u2019s reward is an exponentially weighted average of its own active GRG stake relative to the sum of the other pools\u2019 active GRG stakes (2/3 weight) and the active stake of a pool relative to the sum of the other pool\u2019s active stakes (1/3 weight). In order to avoid confusion, GRG stakers will not be rewarded with OP. In order to guarantee fairness, we will stake at least 2000 GRG to the first 100 new pools and allocate the stake pro-rata to all the smart pools based on their TVL. As each participating pool is required to actively stake a non-null amount of GRG (any amount) and the pool must have at least 100 GRG staked to it (\u2243100$, either own stake or delegated) sufficient liquidity will be provided (either directly or indirectly) on Uniswap V3 on Optimism in order to guarantee the amount can be purchased without slippage. In terms of smart pool liquidity/TVL, smart pool operators are competing against each other, hence the more the assets, the bigger the stake and the bigger the reward. However, operators are not required to bootstrap liquidity like in AMM pools, therefore a smart pool can be run with any amount of tokens. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: 12 weeks. Each Rigoblock epoch is 2 weeks long. Therefore, 1/6th of the total amount will be distributed each epoch (i.e. every two weeks), exhausting the amount after approximately 3 months. The same amount of OP will be allocated to each epoch, with individual pool APY expected to decrease as the aggregate pools\u2019 TVL grows. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: The following dates assume a grant is approved on Mar 30th. Should actual event occur later, we kindly ask that the dates be adjusted accordingly, with the goal of maximizing program success odds with appropriate time for users to setup their own pools.  Milestone #1 - 100 new smart pools created by 100 different pool operators on Optimism by Apr 30th 2023 (32% of total OP tokens). Smart pools created by core team controlled wallets or smart contracts will be excluded from the count. Milestone #2 - 100K USD additional TVL on Optimism and public display of relevant information regarding smart pools, staking APYs, experiment APY by May 15th. Milestone #3 - Retain at least 50% of end-of-program-TVL on Aug 30th (i.e. 1 month after the end of the experiment). This metric will exclude TVL acquired after the program and will be used as a benchmark to assess the viability of a similar program in the future.  Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Critical milestone #1 - 1MM USD additional TVL on Optimism and independent TVL source (like DeFi Llama or viable alternative) by Jun 5th (48% of total OP tokens). Critical milestone #2 - 1MM USD in AMM liquidity from Rigoblock smart pools on Optimism by Jun 30th (20% of total OP tokens).  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Users will move from Ethereum L1 and will find the ideal environment for trading and providing liquidity on Optimism. On top of being a cheaper alternative for swapping tokens, Optimism still has not experienced the vast liquidity of Ethereum L1, meaning that returns on liquidity on i.e. Uniswap on many major pairs are still high. Rigoblock pools will keep receiving GRG staking rewards after the OP enhanced rewards program ends. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): ProofOfPerformance: Contract Address 0x9e895962AaceE64e42b8fFFa1efF0AcD7F0B6794 | Optimism StakingProxy: Contract Address 0xb844bdcc64a748fdc8c9ee74fa4812e4bc28fd70 | Optimism RigoblockPoolProxyFactory: Contract Address 0x8DE8895ddD702d9a216E640966A98e08c9228f24 | Optimism AUniswap: Contract Address 0xc1ad7e8ea82f2f5129428a46eb968d08cd40cb92 | Optimism Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:  DAO treasuries looking to run strategies (i.e. staking, liquidity mining, yield farming, treasury diversification) on the treasury tokens can delegate selected members from their community to perform such strategies and always 1) have real time accounting of token allocation 2) be guaranteed that the delegated \u201cmanager\u201d does not have access to the tokens besides what the protocol allows (i.e. swaps, liquidity mining and staking but also participating in governance). This is particularly relevant for delegation mandates where the strategy is simple and stable but needs constant rebalancing, making an onchain governance vote unnecessary and redundant. Users looking for a solution to run strategies for themselves and their partners, with real time allocation of token participation in a pool Users looking to minimize Dapp smart contract risk Users looking to generate yield on their portfolio Users looking to bootstrap their own track record for launching a professional asset management service. Users looking to launch smart wallets without writing smart contracts Users looking to deploy highly efficient smart wallets, as Rigoblock launches an effective transparent upgradable proxy pattern. In this context, the protocol uses an abstract approach to storage, which prevents storage collision by design (this is a huge problem if an upgradable proxy is not developed with care for storage collision). As a consequence of point 6., a publicly available framework for abstract storage upgradable smart wallet proxies, which can be used for an Optimism dev under the Apache2.0 License terms.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: a Rigoblock smart pool has the perk of being upgradable upon request by its pool operator and allowing interaction with DeFi protocols. This means that once a connected DeFi protocol upgrades, the transition will be managed by the Rigoblock protocol with minimal or no effort for the pool operator. Also, should a connected DeFi protocol be subject to a critical vulnerability, the smart pool tokens are never at risk of such vulnerability. A DeFi aggregator, for example, could be subject to the vulnerability of one of its liquidity sources. While the EOA would be exposed to allowance risk, a Rigoblock smart pool is not exposed to that risk. Last but not least, it can prompt DAO treasuries to actively manage their portfolio tokens, thus expanding their capabilities and Optimism usage. Is your project Optimism Native?: No. The project was initially deployed on Ethereum mainnet. The Optimism deployment does not rely on L1 for its operations/existence. So technically, the project on Optimism is independent, but was first deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

Please be sure to monitor it for updates over the course of the review period. At this stage, applications are mainly being reviewed for completeness, and nothing at this stage should be construed as support or opposition by any members of the Grants Council.     gab:  What are you building?: Rigoblock is a fully open source and free to use smart contracts protocol that facilitates the interaction with DeFi applications and the organization of tokens and group of token holders in smart wallets. It is aimed at making interaction with DeFi applications simpler (by abstracting token allowances) and safer (by efficiently removing token allowances when not necessary). Rigoblock is multi-chain, live on Optimism since November 2022.   Hey Gab! Just to be 100% clear here - I really don\u2019t know what Rigoblock is based on this info, and going to the dapp shows me a Uniswap V2 fork-esque protocol without any usable pools to play around with. Could you summarize some of the improvements of Rigoblock compared to similar protocols and also how you\u2019d come to the conclusion that safe.global / enzyme finance are competitors? Just having a bit of a hard time understanding what Rigo does here.     gab:  P tokens will be distributed to Rigoblock pools based on their GRG staking rewards, augmenting the pools\u2019 rewards. Allocated tokens will be split by epoch (each Rigoblock epoch is 2 weeks long) and distributed to the pools on top of their GRG staking reward. We will distribute the allocated OP pro-rata to each smart pool based on the GRG staking rewards. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: 12 weeks. Each Rigoblock epoch is 2 weeks long. Therefore, 1/6th of the total amount will be distributed each week, exhausting the amount after approximately 3 months. The same amount of OP will be allocated to each epoch, with individual pool APY expected to decrease as the aggregate pools\u2019 TVL grows.   Please provide more information on the distribution and how much is allocated to each. 100% is fine if that\u2019s the proposal. Though it\u2019s important to provide more details on the exact calculation of OP rewards and how liquidity will be sourced to support these Rigoblock pools.     gab:  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: The program will start after the Rigoblock epoch following the one when grant is received. All systems are deployed and in use currently, so we can start at any time. Each Rigoblock epoch is 14 days long. Therefore, as the grant is received during Epoch 0, the distribution will start at the beginning of Epoch 3. The last epoch of the program will be Epoch 7.  Milestone #1 - 100 new smart pools created by 100 different pool operators on Optimism by the end of Epoch 2 Milestone #2 - 100K USD additional TVL on Optimism by the end of Epoch 3 Milestone #3 - 1MM USD additional TVL on Optimism by the end of Epoch 5; Milestone #4 - 1MM USD in AMM liquidity on Optimism by the end of Epoch 6. Milestone #5 - Retain at least 50% of end-of-program-TVL 1 month after the end of Epoch 7. This metric will exclude TVL acquired after the program and will be used as a benchmark to assess the viability of a similar program in the future.  Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  Milestone #1 - Display public onchain TVL metrics, through an independent source like DeFi Llama (or viable alternative) by the 15th of May 2023; Milestone #2 - Create a staking section on the platform to display pools APY by 15th of April 2023; Milestone #3 - Provide public data on OP distribution and pools\u2019 APYs, either on the portal or on a public doc as OP distribution progresses by the start of the distribution. Data will be updated as new data become available.    The provided metrics lack specificity and are not tied to clear timeframes. Without specific target dates, it is difficult to assess progress and hold the project accountable. Additionally, the critical milestones mentioned seem to be unrelated (and less critical) milestones. Please revise the milestones to provide clearer and more measurable targets. Review the milestone assessment doc for more information.     gab:  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:  Users looking for a solution to run strategies for themselves and their partners, with real time allocation of token participation in a pool Users looking to minimize Dapp smart contract risk Users looking to generate yield on their portfolio Users looking to bootstrap their own track record for launching a professional asset management service. Users looking to launch smart wallets without writing smart contracts Users looking to deploy highly efficient smart wallets, as Rigoblock launches an effective transparent upgradable proxy pattern. In this context, the protocol uses an abstract approach to storage, which prevents storage collision by design (this is a huge problem if an upgradable proxy is not developed with care for storage collision). As a consequence of point 6., a publicly available framework for abstract storage upgradable smart wallet proxies, which can be used for an Optimism dev under the Apache2.0 License term    Yet again, it\u2019s very unclear to me on what RigoBlock does (based on the available UI, and other information) and how it would solve a core problem on Optimism.

                    "content": "Hi Matt, thank you for your observations. I have amended the proposal with some additions and will check if removing parts of the descriptions makes sense as you highlighted the description of the project is not clear to you. I will give some brief answers here relating to the parts that have been modified after your comments.  Hey Gab! Just to be 100% clear here - I really don\u2019t know what Rigoblock is based on this info, and going to the dapp shows me a Uniswap V2 fork-esque protocol without any usable pools to play around with.  I modified the project description.  Rigoblock is a protocol for on-chain asset management, replicating the operations of an asset management company in a transparent and publicly verifiable way. Reg. the dapp, it is aimed at facilitating interaction with the smart pools for pool operators. Hence, only the operated pools are displayed. I added a link in the project links to the url that redirects to information about a pool given its address (i.e. name, symbol, total supply, unitary value, pool operator, portfolio evaluation through Zapper, and other information like spread, fee, \u2026). The link is aimed at being shared by the pool operator with his relevant peers. With that said, a better displaying of existing pools is work-in-progress. Please note that while the interface is derived from the Uniswap interface, i.e. a fork of the Uniswap interface with new sections for operating a pool, the protocol is an original product. The reason behind choosing the Uniswap interface as base is that Rigoblock pools are connected to Uniswap and the format of the transactions is the same, therefore making deployment of the interface faster. Rigoblock pools can swap tokens on Uniswap (leveraging both V3 and V2 smart routing) and provide liquidity on Uniswap V3. Rigoblock pools\u2019 activity is not just limited to operating on Uniswap, as already staking on the GRG staking system and creating a proposal, voting in the Rigoblock governance is possible. In the future, more external applications will be integrated based on demand.  Could you summarize some of the improvements of Rigoblock compared to similar protocols and also how you\u2019d come to the conclusion that safe.global / enzyme finance are competitors? Just having a bit of a hard time understanding what Rigo does here.  I have added a comparison in the competitors section.  Please provide more information on the distribution and how much is allocated to each. 100% is fine if that\u2019s the proposal. Though it\u2019s important to provide more details on the exact calculation of OP rewards and how liquidity will be sourced to support these Rigoblock pools.  I provided details on calculation in the distribution section. This piece of code here (github) is relevant for the rewards calculations. The linked smart contract is deployed on Optimism at address 0xB844bDCC64a748fDC8c9Ee74FA4812E4BC28FD70.  The provided metrics lack specificity and are not tied to clear timeframes. Without specific target dates, it is difficult to assess progress and hold the project accountable. Additionally, the critical milestones mentioned seem to be unrelated (and less critical) milestones. Please revise the milestones to provide clearer and more measurable targets. Review the milestone assessment doc for more information.  I have amended the milestones with exact dates and program of grant receival. I have included what I initially defined as critical milestones in the milestones they are relevant to. I have also set two objective critical milestones.  Yet again, it\u2019s very unclear to me on what RigoBlock does (based on the available UI, and other information) and how it would solve a core problem on Optimism.  I have added a point as DAO treasuries can use Rigoblock to implement active treasury management strategies, keep track of their actively managed tokens, delegate management to community members/groups. Imo this is relevant as community treasuries will evolve over time and will want to generate yield on their otherwise idle tokens. Also DAO treasuries will have stricter requirements than normal users, which is something that Rigobock does accomodate. If the other points are confusing, I will remove them from the proposal. Please further comment should the answer still not be clear. Thank you again for reviewing the proposal in depth. ",
