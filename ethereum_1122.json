Especially for questions such as: What gives your life meaning? Why? lol  Besides Vitalik, who are 3 or more people in the Ethereum Community that make good role models? What do you admire in them? What are 3 or more organizations, communities, social movements and/or ideologies that are (loosely) related to Ethereum? What values does/should Ethereum embody? Why? What originally attracted you to Ethereum? Why are you still here? What is your happiest memory related to Ethereum? Why? Is there anything in Ethereum (past/present) that frustrated you, or could have been done better? Is there anything in the community that exhausts or tires you? Is there anything we \u2018failed\u2019 or are \u2018failing\u2019 at? In your mind, what would make a good Ethereum community member? What are the values/principles you use to help guide your life? What kind of future do you envision? Are there any fears you hold that you think are relevant to Ethereum? What gives your life meaning? Why?  ",
