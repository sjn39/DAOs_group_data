Security tokens differ materially from other token use-cases, with more complex interactions between off-chain and on-chain actors, and considerable regulatory scrutiny.

However, this is definitely a case of a proposal with the need for strong legal technicalities. I am sure the proposer has done due diligence as the proposal is well written, but I am curious from which jurisdictions this has been evaluated from a legal standpoint. SEC is a big one, ESMA for Europe, Hong Kong SFC, etc. I think adoption of this proposal is likely to hinge on the answers to various legal questions, so I think this should be determined first.  Also, another nitpicky thing: I think semi-fungible tokens (the denomination of a user\u2019s balance by tranches, and the possibility of restriction of transferrability by tranches) should be a separate standard. There is a lot being proposed here, and I think the separation of this functionality from security- and custodian-specific functionality would make this proposal better off. It\u2019s funny, because I was making a similar suggestion for reputation tokens (to be semi-fungible) just the other day. ",

Looks like one of the authors @thegostep joined us here. Welcome! Legal should be considered a SEPARATE layer. I know everyone is freaked out about this, but we need technical interoperability as a foundation to tweak the legal bits. So far, lawyers have tweaked implementation of security tokens on a one off basis (no joke), which is not the way to make for interoperability. Yes the work needs to be done to review, but I have found that I\u2019m the one suggesting technically how things can be done to meet legal needs, not the other way around. ",

In the end we decided we didn\u2019t want to fracture the conversation across two EIPs so combined. The PFT standard has some interesting non-securities applications (e.g. token provenance, in-game bonus mechanics) which we are putting together as a fun medium article right now. A community call would be great - very interested in more discussion around #1066 which we\u2019ve discussed a lot internally (and which led to the return argument specification for checkSecurityTokenSend). One question I have for more experienced forum members - currently we see the conversation being split between Ethereum Magicians and the GitHub Issue - is there prior art on the best way to manage this to keep the conversation in one place?
