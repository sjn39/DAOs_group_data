For the proposal to pass, 20% of quorum and >67% FOR votes are needed, so any vBNT (Bancor gov token) holders amongst the Gitcoin community should go and vote on the proposal. Bancor is the OG DEX where liquidity providers can get decent returns  on staked tokens without suffering from impermanent loss, Bancor has been a friend to Gitcoin community and has sponsored multiple hackathons and bounties in which many developers (myself included) have built features and broadened the horizons of our knowledge. There is currently a snapshot vote live for whitelisting the $GTC token for Bancor Single sided liquidity protection. This is immensely beneficial for GTC holders since they can now provide liquidity on the GTC side of the pool and earn passive yield on the GTC tokens without suffering from IL. This is 2 major benefits -  GTC holders no longer have to sell half their tokens for ETH in order to provide liquidity For a token like GTC which is still in price discovery phase, providing liquidity carries extreme risk of impermanent loss (magnified in UNI v3 where you could potentially involuntarily sell all your GTC for ETH if the token price significantly outperforms vs. ETH)  Additionally, pool whitelisting on Bancor is often followed by additional BNT Liquidity mining rewards for stakers (requires a separate vote) on both TKN side and BNT side of the pool.
