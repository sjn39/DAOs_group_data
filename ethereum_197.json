                    "content": " Proposal: Predictable Ethereum Testnet Lifecycle This proposal is one of the results of the previous discussion in the testnet workgroup with client teams and application developers. We seek general feedback from the Ethereum community on the following plan. TL;DR  launch a new testnet every two years on a defined date, e.g., Oct 1st, 2023, 2025, 2027, etc.  limit lifetime of testnets to five years maximum (four years plus one year long-term support if necessary) extend Goerli long-term support for another two years till 2024 if possible (depending on the outcome of the supply issue discussion)   Problem Statement The current situation of deprecating multiple testnets at once in preparation for the merge with only a few weeks\u2019 notice caused some frustration among application developers and infrastructure providers. The supply issues on the Goerli testnet added to this, unfortunately. As it stands, post-merge there are only two major testnets available (youtube#1UtcvVve32A):  Goerli, which is the only testnet for public testing of staking infrastructure (permissionless) Sepolia, which primarily targets application developers due to its permissioned nature  However, the better and more widely available infrastructure for Goerli prompted many application stacks and layer-2s to migrate to Goerli instead of Sepolia. Both, the network effect of already existing applications on Goerli and the lack of communication for best practices prior to the testnet deprecation and the merge may have caused this. There are efforts to address the Goerli supply issues through the Capella protocol upgrade on the Prater consensus layer for Goerli through boosted withdrawals (ethereum/consensus-specs#3073). This would hopefully allow extending the lifetime of the testnet drastically. Simulations and technical discussion is currently still outstanding (eth-clients/goerli#135).  Proposed Lifetime It is proposed to limit the lifetime of a public Ethereum testnet predictably to four years after genesis and allowing to consider one additional year of long-term support, in case networks are heavily used, to a maximum of five years. After the end-of-life date of a testnet, it will no longer receive support from client teams. In addition, a new testnet will be launched every two years respecting a predetermined schedule. Both client teams and infrastructure providers should commit to support these schedules to allow application developers preparing necessary migrations in advance. Such a schedule will allways guarantee the availability of at least two public testnets for every stakeholder in the ecosystem. A migration of applications will only be necessary every four years on average given the proposed schedule.  Applied Schedule Applying the schedule to the existing testnets would result in Goerli already entering the long-term support phase in Q1/2023. However, since there is currently a lot of migration happening to Goerli, it should be extended by two years till at least 2024. (Update, this is not going to be fixed, so we have to sunset Goerlin in 2023.) Starting with Sepolia Goerli, we commit to the previously defined 4+1 schedule.

                    "content": "Thanks for summarizing the discussion! Chiming in with a few thoughts from the perspective of application developers:  There was a LOT of friction in migrating recently from Kovan/Rinkeby/Ropsten to Goerli as was recommended for post-Merge testing. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than redeploying contracts - state and dependencies on state all need to be sequenced and migrated to minimize breaking environments. There is a lot of value to the demand and mainnet-likeness of Goerli we\u2019re seeing right now. Composability, liquidity, traffic volumes, decentralized/permissionless validator sets all make for a mainnet-like environment which is great for testing and iterating pre-mainnet. There is a lot of value to having a long term testnet where state can accrue, as opposed to ones that reset every few years. This builds on points (1) and (2) but you both lose a lot of value when migrating and there\u2019s a lot of overhead.  Would recommend as a v0 we explore a way to make Goerli more sustainable long term. One such step, as discussed, would be increasing the supply of gEth. I\u2019m sure more community members (Alchemy included) would step in to help the long term viability of this network and not put the whole load on the EF. If we\u2019re unable to mitigate supply side issues in a reasonable manner then perhaps we can try to identify paradigms that might be better suited to long lived testnets. I understand there\u2019s a certain burden on client/protocol development imposed here, but there\u2019s also a large, and increasing (with ethereum adoption) burden on the application layer as well. Thoughts? ",

Polygon: Mumbai Avalanche: Fuji Solana: Devnet BSC: BSC Testnet  I\u2019d like to echo the sentiments from @noam. From an application perspective, having to migrate to a new network every few years is a large burden on both developers and application/infra owners. As Ethereum continues to grow and gain adoption and more developers, I feel more focus should be placed on DX (developer experience) Right now, here is what IMO is the best developer experience regarding testnets:  There should be one, and only one testnet for developers. This network shouldn\u2019t ever change (or not for a very long time) Network should run on POA so its not dependant on stake or community validators, & have the ability to mint lots of ETH (or infinite). There should always be 0 demand for OTC testnet ETH This testnet should have all the major applications & infra (alchemy, opensea, chainlink, the graph etc) Network clients should be upgradeable over time rather than spinning up a new testnet  Right now it\u2019s really hard to get gETH, and gas prices can spike which means what little ETH devs have gets chewed up. I feel with these issues more and more devs will likely turn to L2\u2019s and other EVM chains to develop their applications (Polygon, BSC, Avalanche Fuji etc). We recently had to turn off our ETH faucet due to someone getting around our security measures and taking it to sell it OTC ",

If G\u00f6rli was expected to be deprecated in one year, it would lose its speculative value. DApps should aspire to work with any EVM-compatible chain. See EIP-1820: Pseudo-introspection Registry Contract for how this could be done. For example, a chain-agnostic Uniswap would check to see if there\u2019s already a router deployed, and if not, request that users send ether to the predetermined address and subsequently deploy the predetermined contract. In summary: ephemeral testnets encourage best practices. ",

I feel with these issues more and more devs will likely turn to L2\u2019s and other EVM chains to develop their applications (Polygon, BSC, Avalanche Fuji etc). We recently had to turn off our ETH faucet due to someone getting around our security measures and taking it to sell it OTC   That\u2019s exactly what we are addressing by predictably deprecating testnets.

As most of the apps will only be on the \u201capplication test net\u201d (aka Sepolia) the data that should be tested for indexing is there, but if you want to have a \u201cMainnet like\u201d environment to test reorgs and similar cases the \u201cvalidator test net\u201d (aka Goerli) would be more fitting. Another way would be to test indexing in \u201cprod\u201d (so Mainnet) as it is \u201conly\u201d reading state.
