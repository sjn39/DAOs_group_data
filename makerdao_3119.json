Today we have the xDai team, a very interesting project. We also have Patricio from POAP, the Proof Of Attendance Protocol, joining as a special guest; he\u2019s going to be describing his own project afterwards.

If a mint a POAP in xDai, am I supposed to receive it after two weeks on Ethereum?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:10:28  Patricio, how can people learn more about POAP and find you and follow you et cetera? (01:10:28) I actually wrote a tiny tutorial on how to create a POAP for your event; it\u2019s on definotes.com \u2014 and yeah: it\u2019s super straightforward. Let\u2019s keep the discussion in the forum. Looking forward to see how this evolves. Thank you for joining us.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
