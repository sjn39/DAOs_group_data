Paragraph Summary MIP119 is a proposal to onboard and activate a DAI 500MM vault that lends DAI to the Flux Finance DAI Lending Pool. Flux Finance is a decentralized lending protocol developed by Ondo Finance that enables over-collateralized lending and borrowing in a peer-to-pool model. The protocol is a fork of Compound V2 with minor modifications related to permissioning that have been audited through code4rena. Loans on Flux are overcollateralized by the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG), a class of limited partnership interests in Ondo I LP, a Delaware limited partnership. OUSG is backed by investments in the Blackrock iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) and uses third-party regulated service providers for custody, fund administration, and auditing. This proposal begins by providing an overview of Ondo entities and the structure of OUSG before turning to Flux and its DAI Lending Pool. THIS PROPOSAL IS PROVIDED FOR SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT MAKE, AND NEITHER FLUX FINANCE NOR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROPOSAL OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

OUSG Transaction Diagram  1076\u00d7942 114 KB    Ondo Finance wholly owns the Investment Manager and GP   The Investment Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of ETFs   The GP acts as the General Partner of the Fund   OUSG Investors send stablecoins to the Fund\u2019s Coinbase account, purchasing OUSG tokens, which the Fund sends to the OUSG Investors   The Fund has engaged Coinbase to hold stablecoins, convert stablecoins to USD, and wire funds to Clear Street, as directed by the Investment Manager   The Fund has engaged Clear Street for prime brokerage services and utilizes Clear Street to hold and trade assets   The Investment Manager instructs Clear Street (CS), which executes trades, clears, and custodies the Fund\u2019s assets in the Fund\u2019s CS Account    Ondo I LP On Feb 2, 2023, Ondo launched Ondo I LP (the \u201cFund\u201d) and its Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund limited partnership class (OUSG). The Fund enables stablecoin holders to gain exposure to the Blackrock iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) by investing in a tokenized bond fund that provides daily liquidity. OUSG is a total return fund that automatically reinvests dividends paid out by SHV. The Fund currently accepts USDC and DAI but could accept other stablecoins at the GP\u2019s discretion. The OUSG limited partnership class holds one primary asset, Blackrock/iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV), plus a small quantity of stablecoins and cash for processing during subscriptions and redemptions. SHV is a liquid, exchange traded (NASDAQ) ETF with approximately $19 billion in assets and averages almost $300 million in daily trading volume. OUSG is currently the only share class in the Fund, but others are anticipated, specifically OSTB and OHYG, which will each invest in a single Blackrock or PIMCO ETF. The market risks of the holdings in each share class do not impact the other share classes as the fund is not using leverage. If the investments of OSTB and OHYG both go to zero, investors in OUSG are unaffected. OUSG limited partnership interests are issued as tokens (\u201cTokens\u201d) on the Ethereum blockchain. OUSG can be minted (i.e. subscribed to) and redeemed on any US business day (excluding federal holidays). Subscriptions and redemptions are processed based on the next daily NAV as calculated by the fund administrator, NAV Consulting, Inc. Ondo anticipates redemptions to take up to 2-3 business days to settle (for an investor to receive their stablecoins/USD) if the fund does not have sufficient stablecoins or USD on hand to service the redemption immediately, as it takes two business days to access dollars and then stablecoins from the sale of the ETFs. NAV Consulting has read-only API access to the Fund\u2019s accounts, which are at Coinbase and Clear Street. On a daily basis, NAV Consulting calculates the NAV per Token as follows:   sum the current value of all the fund assets (SHV shares, cash, and stablecoins)   subtract accrued fund expenses and management fees, and   divide by the number of Tokens outstanding   Ondo updates the contract price for OUSG daily using the calculation provided by NAV Consulting. You can read more about this process in the \u201cFlow of Funds and Operational Controls\u201d section below. NAV Consulting also reports the NAV on a monthly basis directly to all OUSG investors. Expenses and management fees are capped at a combined 30 bps, as we explain below in \u201cMIP119c5: Fees\u201d. OUSG is available to both US and non-US investors. Potential investors are required to pass KYC/AML/CFT screening and be both \u201caccredited investors\u201d and \u201cqualified purchasers\u201d under Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and under Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, respectively. Permissioned Token holders may redeem their Tokens daily and also may transfer their Tokens on-chain to other permissioned investors. Ondo uses smart contracts to enforce these transfer restrictions. Though withholding tax applies to certain types of income for non-US investors (not US investors), Ondo has agreed to pay all investor withholding taxes on behalf of the Fund. Moreover, the vast majority of income generated by OUSG (~97% for the trailing twelve months) is exempt from withholding taxes, as it is Qualified Interest Income (QII), resulting in a very low withholding tax burden.  Flow of Funds and Operational Controls Ondo manages the flow of funds between the blockchain, the Fund\u2019s accounts at Coinbase Prime, and the Fund\u2019s brokerage account at Clear Street. Coinbase Prime acts as an intermediary that converts investor funds between stablecoins and US dollars, while the Clear Street accounts are where the SHV ETFs are purchased, sold, and custodied. The brokerage accounts (at both Coinbase Prime and Clear Street) are opened in the name of the Fund. Ondo implements strict operational controls with industry-leading security mechanisms for smart contract and fund management. On the blockchain, Ondo uses Gnosis Safe multisig contracts configured to require three signers for the execution of smart contract management or token transfer actions. Each participant in the multisig is an employee of Ondo and is required to utilize a hardware wallet. Ondo uses the following permissioned multisig contracts for their respective listed capabilities: Ondo Cash Management Multisig:   Configure minimum redemption and subscription amounts on the CashManager contract.   Configure rate limiter parameters on the CashManager contract. (i.e. what quantity of subscriptions and redemptions can be serviced in a single day)   Configure fee recipients on the CashManager contract (fees are currently turned off).   Set exchange rates for the minting of OUSG.   Mint OUSG to service subscriptions.   Pause functionality on the CashManager contract in the event of an emergency   Burn OUSG in the event of an emergency.   Upgrade the OUSG implementation contract in the event of an emergency.   Execute a multicall function in the CashManager contract for the scenario in which a user accidentally transfers tokens to the CashManager contract.   Ondo Redemption Multisig:  Can send stablecoins it has possession of through the CashManager contract to service redemptions.  Please note that Ondo uses role-based access control (RBAC) in its smart contracts and reserves the right to deploy additional multisigs to utilize a more secure and granular RBAC scheme. Ondo has worked with Coinbase to establish security policies that minimize employee access to the Fund operations and accounts. In order to perform critical actions on the account, a consensus of three employees must be reached and validated by each employee\u2019s respective Yubikey hardware authentication device. These critical actions include adding trusted withdrawal blockchain addresses, transferring funds on the blockchain or between Fund accounts, and changing user access levels. For withdrawals of a notional value larger than $500,000 the consensus requirement increases to four employees. All consensus configuration changes require a consensus of three employees and a video call with a Coinbase representative. The Fund accounts at Coinbase are only permitted to send US dollar wire transfers to the Fund\u2019s accounts at Clear Street. The Clear Street account wires are sent and received through its bank, BMO Harris, while Coinbase wires are sent and received through its bank, Silvergate Bank. It is not possible for the Fund to \u201cfat finger\u201d a wire to another account. In order to get another account approved to receive a wire transfer, the Fund would have to first receive a wire transfer from that bank account to the Fund\u2019s Coinbase account, and then work with a Coinbase representative to configure the bank as a trusted withdrawal destination. With respect to the Fund\u2019s brokerage account at Clear Street, Ondo employees only have read-only permissions to the Clear Street portal. All money transfers and trades are instructed over electronic communication channels and are strictly confined to sending (or receiving) money via wire to (from) the Fund\u2019s Coinbase Prime account or purchasing and selling the SHV ETF. In order for a new bank account to be approved as a new destination for outgoing wire transfers, the following criteria must be met:  One of the Fund\u2019s authorized personnel has to ask for the new account to be added over email. The new bank account must be under the \u201cOndo I LP\u201d name. The authorized person must give verbal confirmation on a phone call with a representative from Clear Street.   Legal Documents The OUSG subscription docs, limited partnership agreement (LPA), and private placement memorandum (PPM) are available here. You can find detailed risk factors on the offering in the PPM.  MIP119c2: Flux Finance Overview and Ondo DAO  1600\u00d7900 47.5 KB  Flux Finance: Permissionless Lending Meets Permissioned Collateral Flux Finance (Flux) is a special purpose lending protocol facilitating stablecoin loans against tokenized US Treasuries collateral. Flux is similar to Treasury repo markets, where large institutions effectively lend and borrow over-collateralized against Treasuries. Flux is designed to deliver Treasuries-backed yield in a highly liquid form on-chain. Flux was developed by Ondo and is now owned by Flux Finance, a British Virgin Islands business company and wholly owned subsidiary of Neptune Development Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company. Flux is an autonomous protocol on the Ethereum blockchain with certain upgrades governed by the Ondo DAO. Flux is a fork of Compound V2, with minimal modifications to enable support for assets that have transfer restrictions, such as OUSG. Just like Compound, Flux follows a peer-to-pool model and is designed to always quote a lend and borrow rate based on supply and demand. Lenders can supply stablecoins (currently DAI and USDC) to earn yield, while borrowers can pledge tokenized Treasuries as collateral. The tokenized Treasuries supported are in the form of OUSG (discussed above).  Flux Governance As part of the Ondo DAO, ONDO token holders have the ability to modify certain economic parameters of Flux through on-chain governance proposals. The Ondo DAO is a fork of Compound\u2019s Governor Bravo. There is a three day voting period and a one day timelock. Voting power is based on ONDO token ownership, and token holders can delegate their voting power to other wallets. You can read more about the Ondo DAO and its parameters at the following link: The Ondo DAO | Flux Finance Docs Tally maintains a front-end where ONDO token holders can participate in DAO votes at the following link: Tally | Ondo DAO Flux Diagram, including OUSG origination at Ondo and borrowing DAI via Flux  1600\u00d71410 255 KB   How Flux Works You can access documentation on Flux at the following link: https://docs.fluxfinance.com/ You can also read the most relevant details below.  fTokens Users supply assets into Flux to mint fTokens, ERC-20 tokens representing balances on the protocol. For example, a user can supply DAI into Flux to mint fDAI. Some supplied assets are lendable by the protocol and earn the user interest in return. In the case of DAI, the user would earn Flux\u2019s DAI supply rate. fTokens are a fork of Compound V2\u2019s cTokens, enhanced with additional functionality to support permissioned assets and their transfer restrictions. For example, fOUSG can only be transferred to addresses that are permitted to hold OUSG. Note that fDAI can be transferred permissionlessly, just like DAI.  Lending Users can become lenders by supplying assets to mint fTokens. The interest earned by the protocol isn\u2019t distributed; instead, the exchange rate for fTokens increases, and users will be able to redeem more assets over time as interest is earned. The interest rate earned by lenders (supply rate) fluctuates and depends on the market\u2019s utilization (i.e. the percentage of supplied assets that has been borrowed).  Borrowing Flux is an over-collateralized lending protocol. Borrowers must provide collateral worth more than the debt to guarantee an incentive to repay it. Each asset has an associated collateral ratio, i.e. the share of its value that can be borrowed. Assets with zero collateral ratio can\u2019t be used as collateral. Borrowers can use fTokens as collateral to borrow other assets. The borrow rate for an asset fluctuates based on its utilization (i.e. the percentage of the asset\u2019s pool that has been borrowed). The borrow rate increases as utilization increases, balancing supply and demand for a given asset. The borrow rate increases sharply once utilization surpasses a threshold (\u2018kink\u2019), incentivizing borrowers to repay some of the debt to maintain enough liquidity for lenders. If an account\u2019s liquidity (i.e. the aggregate collateral factor of its assets) becomes negative, this account becomes liquidatable and might incur a small liquidation fee.  Liquidation A borrower\u2019s collateral should always be worth more than the borrowed balance to ensure the protocol and its lenders suffer no losses. Liquidations should be rare on Flux, particularly for high quality Treasury-backed collateral such as OUSG. However, in certain extreme scenarios, a borrower\u2019s equity can become too low and the account might need to be liquidated: some of its collateral is sold off to pay back the debt. Third-party liquidators are incentivized to take on this role by being able to buy the collateral at a small discount compared to the oracle price. Liquidations on Flux are very similar to liquidations on Compound V2. An account becomes subject to liquidation when its liquidity (i.e. the aggregate collateral factor of its assets) becomes negative. At that point, a third-party liquidator will be able to pay off some of the borrower\u2019s debt and seize the corresponding collateral at a small discount. The protocol will also collect a small piece of the collateral and add it to its reserves. However, unlike on Compound, liquidations on Flux respect the underlying asset\u2019s permissions (e.g. KYC). For example, to liquidate an account using OUSG as collateral, the liquidator must be KYC\u2019d and whitelisted to hold that token. Additionally, as a safety mechanism, Flux\u2019s oracles never price stablecoins at more than 1 USD, reducing the risk of external oracle manipulation (e.g. to prevent a borrower from being liquidated due to a manipulation upwards in the price of a stablecoin).  Bad Debt Accrual Bad debt accrual should be extremely unlikely on Flux since its assets, tokenized Treasuries, are generally very stable. The greatest weekly move ever in SHV, the short-term Treasuries ETF that OUSG invests into, is less than 0.5% since its inception in 2007. Considering that liquidations of loans against OUSG begin at 92% LTV, this provides a tremendous margin of safety to lenders on Flux.  MIP119c3: Flux Market Parameters  Lending Asset Parameters: DAI and USDC  Interest rate curve:  0% utilization \u2192 0% APY 90% utilization (kink) \u2192 Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) - 50 bps* 100% utilization \u2192 OBFR + 300bps   Collateral Factor (LTV): 0** Borrow Cap: No cap ProtocolSeizeShare: 1.75% (Compound V2 uses 2.8%)  This is how much of seized collateral during a liquidation is added to reserves.    *A multisig controlled by Flux Finance (the BVI company) will, for the time being, update the nominal \u201cborrow rate at kink\u201d if and when OBFR moves by more than 5 bps, until a third-party oracle for OBFR can be obtained (e.g. from Chainlink). See \u201cFlux Finance Multisig Operations\u201d below for an overview of Flux multisig controls and operational safeguards. **There is a pending proposal to set the collateral factor for all assets other than OUSG to 0, accessible here: [FIP-01] Adding USDT Support; Setting Stablecoin Collateral Factor to 0% - Governance Proposals - Flux Finance Governance Forum You can visualize the fDAI curve at current market rates below (accessible at Flux Finance):  1392\u00d7822 54.6 KB   Borrowing Asset Parameters: OUSG  Interest Rate Curve: Not a borrowable asset, so N/A Collateral Factor (LTV):  92% Borrow Cap: Not a borrowable asset, so not applicable ProtocolSeizeShare: Not a borrowable asset, so N/A (0%)   Miscellaneous Parameters  Reserve Factor: 0% Liquidation Incentive: 5%   Flux Finance Multisig Operations Flux utilizes a Gnosis Safe multisig contract that is configured to require three signers for the execution of smart contract management functions. Each participant in the following multisig is an employee of Flux Finance (a BVI company) and is required to utilize a hardware wallet. The multisig can be found at this address. The \u201cFlux Governance\u201d multisig has the permissioned owner role of the oracle contract used by the Flux lending market, the interest rate model contract, and OracleSafetyWrapper. It has the capability to perform the following functions for the respective Contracts: InterestRateModel (a.k.a JumpRateModel) Contract:   Change the owner of this contract Change the interest rate model (see above section titled \u201cOBFR\u201d for more)  OndoPriceOracleV2:   Configure new \u201cfan out\u201d oracle associations. For example, having the oracle use Compound\u2019s price oracle for pricing USDC, or a Chainlink oracle for a different stablecoin Configure a price cap in which the oracle will not return a price higher than for a specific fToken\u2019s underlying asset Set the price of an fToken\u2019s underlying asset directly  To prevent operational mistakes, the OndoPriceOracleV2 contract\u2019s price setting functionality is wrapped with some basic checks to limit the amount that the price can change in-between price setting transactions. The Flux Finance multisig can set a change tolerance constraint in basis points. The initial tolerance constraint set is 200 basis points, or 2%. The OracleSafetyWrapper contract can be found here.  MIP119c4: Vault Deployment, Integrations and Migrations Flux Finance will collaborate with Protocol Engineering Core Unit or functionally equivalent Core Units on the best technical implementation. Implementation will only occur once a technical assessment has been presented by the relevant Core Units. We would kindly ask the Risk and Strategic Finance Core Units to make a recommendation on Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) parameters for this deployment.  MIP119c5: Fees Flux does not charge any fees or spread at the DAI lending pool. Ondo charges a 0.15% annual management fee for OUSG plus fund expenses, which are capped at 0.15% per annum, which are paid directly by OUSG investors (i.e. Maker would not pay these fees itself).

                    "content": "Thank you for your detailed questions. Please see below for initial responses from the Flux team:  What is the NAV Consulting company\u2019s function in the Fund, and how do they calculate the daily NAV per Token?  NAV Consulting is the Fund Administrator for Ondo Fund I LP, and performs several functions for the fund. First, NAV Consulting calculates the Fund\u2019s closing Net Asset Value on a daily basis, which corresponds to the price of OUSG. NAV Consulting has read-only API access to all of the Fund\u2019s accounts including its Coinbase and Clear Street accounts. NAV Consulting calculates the current value of all of the Fund\u2019s assets including its ownership in SHV at Clear Street, its USD at Coinbase and Clear Street, and its stablecoins at Coinbase. Then, NAV Consulting accounts for all of the Funds\u2019 intraday activities including market gains and losses on SHV, trading fees, and accrued management fees to calculate the total NAV at market close. NAV Consulting then divides the Fund\u2019s total NAV by the number of Tokens (equivalently shares) outstanding to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV per Token (i.e. the price of OUSG) at the close of each day. Second, NAV Consulting maintains an independent ledger of each investor\u2019s ownership. At the close of the day, NAV Consulting admits new investors and calculates how many OUSG tokens should be issued by dividing the value of new subscriptions by the closing NAV per Token price. Similarly, for redemptions, NAV Consulting calculates how much USDC should be returned to investors based on the closing NAV per Token price. NAV Consulting also tracks an investor\u2019s cost basis into the Fund which is used to calculate management fees contribution. Finally, NAV Consulting provides Ondo Fund I investors unaudited monthly financial statements including fund balance sheet, P&L, and income statement through their separate portal. With these documents, investors can verify the Fund\u2019s performance, price of OUSG, and their respective ownership in the fund.  How do participants redeem their OUSG tokens, and how long does it take to settle a redemption? Is it T+3 settlement?  OUSG investors can redeem in one of two ways: (1) by signing \u201cAPPENDIX 2 \u2013 REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\u201d (provided in the subscription docs) and send it to [email\u00a0protected] and Ondo will begin the redemption process, or (2) by sending their OUSG tokens to a smart contract address provided by Ondo to investors who sign subscription documents. Note that the functionality for (2) is coming very soon but is not live today. In either case, a redemption will be processed based on the next end of day NAV available (e.g. if an investor requests a redemption at 2pm on Tuesday, that will be honored based on market closing prices on Tuesday). If the Fund has stablecoins on hand (e.g. if another investor just subscribed) it can service the redemption immediately. Otherwise, the Fund will sell the required number of ETF shares, using Clear Street as the trading broker, then wait for the T+2 settlement before servicing the redemption. If the investor is redeeming from USDC, which is the only case live today, the Fund will send a wire transfer from the Fund\u2019s account at Clear Street to the Fund\u2019s account at Coinbase, convert USD to USDC at Coinbase, then send to the investor\u2019s wallet. (Soon there will be a smart contract, audited by code4rena, used to facilitate accounting around redemptions.)  Can you please provide a simple summary of the \u201cQualified Interest Income\u201d (QII), and why is it exempt from withholding taxes? Took a look at the link you provided\u2013might need to hire a tax attorney to dissect.   Apologies for the poorly-chosen link. We pulled the following from PIMCO: \u201cThe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allowed ETFs having regulated investment company status to designate amounts of QII and STCG as exempt from Nonresident Alien Withholding Tax (\u201cNRA Withholding Tax\u201d) when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with appropriate tax documentation. The exemption expired\u2026 but has since been extended permanently\u2026 with the \u201cProtecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015\u201d enacted on 12/18/15.\u201d We suspect the intent of this exemption is to encourage offshore investment into US-based bonds and loans. The precise definition is a bit technical, but most interest and short-term capital gains qualify as QII. Thankfully, Blackrock reports the QII for its iShares products here: https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/qualified-interest-income-qii-percentages-final-2023.pdf You can see the QII % was 100% for the only dividend made so far in 2023, but it was often more like 97% historically (as there are some long-term capital gains). Ondo is paying for the withholding for now to keep things simple for offshore investors. You can see an example explanation in the Ondo FAQ:  Do you withhold taxes?\u200b  Withholding tax applies only to certain types of income for non-US investors, but not for US investors. Thankfully, the vast majority of income from the assets Ondo funds invest in is exempt from withholding, as it is Qualified Interest Income (QII). For example, at the time of writing, ~99% of assets in OUSG are exempt from withholding. In the worst case scenario, for non-US investors in jurisdictions that don\u2019t have withholding tax treaties with the US, 30% of non-exempt income is withheld. For example, ~97% of SHV income is exempt from withholding, meaning a 4% gross yield would turn into 4% - 4%*(1-30%)*3% = 3.92%, for a loss of less than 0.1% to withholding (some of which can also be claimed back).   As an example; with QII does the term \u201c10-percent shareholder\u201d in this context refers to a shareholder who directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power, and those this mean that MakerDAO cannot own more than 10%?  The QII designation is with respect to income from the underlying ETF, which has $20B+ in assets, not with respect to OUSG. Additionally, under the proposal made by Flux, Maker would not actually own any OUSG directly, or have to directly deal with this issue (as it would lend DAI into Flux, over-collateralized by OUSG).  The architecture of Compound V2 was a bit too risky(why Comp is gradually moving to V3) \u2013 has Flux dotted all the i\u2019s and crossed all the t\u2019s when it comes to forking Comp V2?  We addressed Compound V2\u2019s First Deposit Bug operationally (by being the first depositors and burning a small portion of fTokens on when initializing a market). We don\u2019t have liquidity mining turned on so are not worried about previous high-profile bugs related to rewards distribution. As a general matter, Flux is very limited in scope and complexity compared to Compound\u2019s V2 deployment as there is only one collateral type (OUSG).  It also sounds like Flux can \u201cblacklist\u201d fTokens since there are transfer restrictions?  fDAI and fUSDC cannot be blacklisted unilaterally by Flux Finance since the only transfer restrictions that exist on these tokens are sanctions checks provided by a publicly available Chainalysis Sanctions Oracle. fOUSG has transfer restrictions that mimic the same restrictions as those on OUSG (where only investors who have passed KYC/AML/CFT and signed subscription documents with Ondo I LP can be added to a whitelist to hold OUSG).

EDIT: See below comment explaining this is no longer necessarily true. Thanks @hexonaut, this is an interesting new development for D3Ms! You may also wish to consider a Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for this deployment. The DC-IAM would mean that exposure would more gradually ramp up rather than deploying 500 million DAI in a single transaction, which would probably alleviate some of the concerns raised by @GFXlabs. If you would rather that Maker specifies values for these parameters (e.g. through the Risk and Strategic Finance Core Units), please specify that in the MIP for completeness. ",

I can answer on behalf of Ondo.     blockmagic:   It looks like the underlying ETF used in OUSG is already charging 15bps. Can you confirm that the all-in charge for this is 0.45%? 15bps of ETF fees, 15bps of Ondo Management Fees, and 15bps (max) of fund expenses.    Yes, max 45 bps, if you include the ETF fee. (I just want to flag, though, that Maker would not be responsible for any of these fees as the fees pertain to the collateral that borrowers would be pledging at Flux.)     blockmagic:   I don\u2019t see anywhere in the PPM that states the Fund Expenses are capped at 15bps. Why is this and where can we find this?     It\u2019s not in the docs but we will add it in. (We started making this promise once the Fund went live and we got a few questions related to Fund expenses.) We\u2019ll share the updated docs once this change is live (along with some other small language changes in favor of investors to tighten up our promises). In practice, the largest expenses by far are likely the administration fees from NAV Consulting (at roughly $2.5k minimum per month, and otherwise 6 bps per annum), plus the year-end audit and tax filing fees (TBD). With the Fund already greater than $40M AUM, the $2.5k monthly minimum already takes the administration expense down to <7.5 bps per annum (which will continue to decline as AUM increases until it hits 6 bps per annum).     blockmagic:   In the Fund Expense section of the PPM, it states the following blurb below.

Let me know if formally implementing the Fund expenses cap assuages your concern on this topic, otherwise happy to revisit. Please note as well that inquiries, judgments, etc. related to the Investment Manager (Ondo Capital Management), General Partner (Ondo I GP), Ondo Finance Inc., or protocols like Flux Finance would not be counted as a Fund expense under the above language. Let me know if you have any other questions related to Ondo! Excited to see this initiative progress. ",
