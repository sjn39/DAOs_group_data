If other delegates share any of these concerns, I\u2019ll be happy to address them but this is so inaccurate and disrespectful that I don\u2019t believe it merits a direct response.    We would like to make it clear to delegates and everyone else that this effectively puts us two months behind on hiring due to the lack of clarity around our budget. This is not productive for our team or the DAO. Without boundaries, there\u2019s nothing stopping anonymous accounts from effectively DDOS\u2019ing the DAO.

One concept that I think is important here is focusing on the idea rather than the person posting it. From the Governance side, we do not want to be put in the position of being asked to determine who can legitimately propose governance actions and who cannot. Instead we enforce rules on structure that allow the community to engage and give MKR holders some guidance as to how the community is receiving them. Offboarding is an inherently tense subject, but I think trying to engage with the content of the proposals is the best way forward to inform the MKR voters. From the governance end, as long as all further requirements are met, this proposal would be eligible for the January governance cycle. This thread is the best place to debate the proposal at hand and ultimately will be linked on the vote copy if this proposal proceeds onchain. ",

Specification  Motivation Experiments are great in every organisation. This becomes truer for web3 and truest for MakerDAO. That being said, when an experiment is not killed in time, it becomes a money pit or a missed opportunity. Several strong reasons indicate that this is a good time to release this team from their duties:  Lack of Quality This point might be hard to qualify or quantify when a shop is up and running. Ultimately it comes down to the metrics. The meme Wizard has done much better things and there are groups interested in making swag great again.  Lack of Service It has been reported by several community members that the site has been down for weeks, which is unacceptable at any point in time after 1997.  Lack of Accountability This team promised 50% of the revenue of the shop, and they have vested approximately 0 Dai to the Protocol. We probably don\u2019t care that much, but not delivering on a promise should have some consequences. Reputation?  Conclusion After wasting everyone\u2019s time and delivering zero results --both in terms of branding or monetary-- we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several miles higher.  Core Unit ID MDS-001 ",
