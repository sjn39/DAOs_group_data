                    "content": "This post is more for sentiment check For Maker protocol, there are many criteria in order to be a collateral but traditionally coins and tokens need to be liquid onchain (such as DEX on Ethereum) to be eventually onboarded. And this is not unique to Maker, other leading ETH based DeFi protocols such as Compound and AAVE also consider onchain liqudidity as important aspect of the collateral assessment. As I have hear feedback from various projects, I realized that there\u2019s a missing market at the moment where very large cap and liquid coins on Centralized Exchanges (or other chains) are interested in providing large collateral and mint a large amount of Dai but they also understand that as their liquidity on ETH mainnet is low or non existent, it\u2019s very unlikely to be onboarded. However, as RWA has been gaining attention for Maker Protocol, I realized that while the structure will be of course very different, in theory, it might be possible for Maker protocol to create a system where it holds collateral token in custody such as exchanges or OTC desks where if it is liquidated, is still able to sell them on the market to ensure the debt is repaid back (because they are liquid enough to handle millions on the market). And this also means potential large institutions that want to use BTC rather than WBTC might be able to access Maker protocol as well. But before I think more about this kind of set up, I was curious about the community\u2019s feedback. Initially, I believe only coins with:  More than $2 Billion in Circulating Marketcap More than $200 million in daily Trading Volume or better option would be examining ways to measure liquidity to see whether they can handle large sell off. Willing to mint significant amount of Dai (which we will examine in this poll)  ",
