                    "content": "Today I had a brainstorming about ways to create a secure Wallet UI representing transactions in a \u201csound and complete\u201d way. Where the \u201cSound UI\u201d should prevent Views from rendering misleading representation, and the \u201cComplete UI\u201d  means an ability to define a \u201csound\u201d View for any given type of data (pictures+text). We came to conclusion, that existing Layout Managers implementation were built without \u201csoundness\u201d in mind: it is possible to supply specially prepared data, moving visual elements into invisibility at least partially (and without any notification for the user). Looks like the silent cropping of the visual representation is considered as not that bad. Dear Wallet Devs: is the problem real? Do you use your own Layout Manager and Renderer to prevent misleading representations or you trust the usual one? ",
