Welcome to another KYM session, in this case KYM #05. We\u2019re going to be discussing the Term Lending Module, which is MIP43. Its authors are Alberto Cuestaca\u00f1ada and Alan Niemerg. Before we start, I don\u2019t know if you want to give a quick update on who you are for those that don\u2019t know you (0:30). For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.  Discussion Alan Niemerg and Lev Livnev Discussion and Questions  04:26 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: One of the questions that came up is, how do you determine the interest rate or the implicit interest rates?   07:24 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Stepping back a little bit, potentially Yield would take care of locking the ETH and minting fyDai. Is that how it works? And then the fyDai goes into Maker   08:23 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: And the fyDai is then locked into another vault within Maker?   08:58 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Usually Maker is more about generating fees. Why would Maker want to pay fees in this case?   09:49 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you walk us through an example with numbers, even if it\u2019s very rough math?   11:08 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you potentially redeem it within the\u2026 I guess not. The difference is that you can only redeem it at the end of the year, it\u2019s kind of like a zero-coupon bond   13:27 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Lev, who is the core user that would potentially be interested in using this product or this solution?   15:55 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Potentially the rate would be similar to a bank, in which the fixed rate is slightly higher than the variable rate. Is that how you guys thought about it?   17:25 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: I have a question on yield curves. You details the examples of short-term interest rates being much higher than long-term interest rates. The TLM module purchases these fyDai and effectively creates a price floor, and therefore ceiling on the borrowing cost for a given series. I\u2019m wondering if the opposite can work as well. If the DSS TLM is not going to be selling mature assets, how do you see it creating a floor on interest rates for long-term loans?   19:00 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: In the example, when stability fees are zero percent and we want to encourage a regular sloping yield curve where long-term rates are going to be above some X percent, I was wondering it that also could be done with the current implementation   21:02 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: It was just that I realized that the interest rates can be set only one way, so I just thought that I would ask that. And ultimately I think that long-term we should have that ability, so that it gives us more flexibility as we interact with the yield curve eventually   23:02 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: I see that one use case for having higher rates long-term in a market where rates are suppressed due to the demand of borrowing is basically for fixed-term lenders\u2026 or fixed-rate lenders that are more conservative in general. It wouldn\u2019t benefit borrowers, of course, but lenders for sure   24:08 \u2014 Primoz: What\u2019s the current liquidity of fyDai? As I imagine, if you want to borrow fixed-term, you need to find the lender and there needs to be some kind of market for fyDai so people actually buy it, because of the zero-coupon bond. I imagine the biggest benefits for you is that you\u2019re going to get a nice liquid market if this gets implemented. I was just curious about the current state, how liquid it is if someone wants to borrow   25:47 \u2014 Primoz: You said fyDai is basically mimicking ETH-A vault, but in some sense these loans that Maker would be buying, they are originated through your protocol. So, it does have the risk profile of your protocol, although it\u2019s mimicking ETH-A. Because we would be buying a pool of loans, right? What\u2019s your debt ceiling? What kind of auction system do you use? This is all relevant because, even if you set an interest rate higher long-term, there\u2019s also this risk aspect. And it\u2019s not Maker\u2019s risk in this sense; it\u2019s Yield\u2019s Protocol risk that we need to assess   28:21 \u2014 Primoz: If it comes to losses, do you have any buffer to cover them?   29:46 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: I\u2019ve been involved with the development of liquidation 2.0 in Maker, and we chose a standard Dutch auction, where the price starts high and then it\u2019s dropped. I\u2019m not an auction expert, so I\u2019m wondering if your team had a rationale for choosing a reverse Dutch auction over a Dutch auction\u2026 It\u2019s the same type of mechanism but it\u2019s done with collateral going up rather than price going down?   31:29 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: Relative to the OSM price or the price oracle at which the auction starts, where does the price of the collateral end at the top of the hour?   33:34 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: It makes sense why the price decreasing function is held within an hour and the rate of t increases\u2026 If you start at half and then go to probably the full liquidation price, isn\u2019t that like a floor of 33% or something? If ETH falls less than 33% within the hour, then it would be profitable to purchase it. This is an extreme, almost black swan-like market condition, but in the event that ETH drops over 33% in the hour, is that the failure mode?   37:22 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: I was looking at the smart contracts earlier and it looks like the maturing gem abstract is pretty general and could possibly be adapted to other fixed-term lending facilities. Yield is one of them, Notional is another, and I think there\u2019s another protocol called Mainframe. How do you think Maker Governance should assess these different zero-coupon lending facilities as it considers different maturing assets to purchase?   40:57 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I have a question regarding the maturity. Are you regarding the time or the horizon\u2026 Is it around one year always? What\u2019s the plan behind that?   42:31 \u2014 S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: If we look at Notional, the rates for July are 6%, 7%. That\u2019s the kind of things you can lock in, which is higher than the ETH-A vault, it\u2019s more fees from us. The interesting part is that it will decrease exposure to USDC because the current PSN is currently buying USDC and we might want to buy something else that is not related to USDC. FyDai is related mainly Maker and another protocol which is decentralized because the smart contract is immutable [\u2026] between these two. The only difference is that, if there is a drop in the demand of Dai, we can\u2019t sell the fyDai, at least in this current implementation   44:52 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Primoz asked on the chat \u201cAre you also planning on offering non-ETH based fyDai? How would you call it?\u201d   45:18 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Focusing on yield protocol, do you see a future where maybe your protocol is also going to focus on some of the new players, maybe like Compound Cash or maybe even USDC, and there will be an fyCash, fyUSDC\u2026?   46:34 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Seeing something like Linen, which is an app for the everyday Jane and Joe, to have access to a fixed rate via fyDai\u2026 I think it would be such a win for them. To allow someone like the average Joe just to get a six-month zero-coupon\u2026   47:39 \u2014 Free discussion with Teddy Woodward from Notional   51:47 \u2014 Kenton Prescott: I was trying to find information on the yield series, such as volume and tdl. I was wondering if you have an analytics dashboard that\u2019s currently public  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 52:19  Alan, where can people find more about Yield and more about yourself? (52:19). Lev, do you want to give your Twitter handle for people to follow your thoughts or write to you? (52:51). Teddy (53:07). Thanks to everyone for coming. It was really nice.
