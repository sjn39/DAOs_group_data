Overall, I think there are better ways to ensure a fair and legitimate launch of the project. ",

User Wallet Fraud Detection This API flags wallets with irregular patterns that are common among malicious actors. Banks have developed the ability to identify patterns of transactions that allow them to freeze accounts complicit in money laundering. SHIELD analyzes blockchain transaction history to develop its own fraud detection models. SHIELD gives access to input variables useful for predicting scams before they happen. Some variables include:     Fraudulent Behavior Money Laundering    Wallets with abnormal/rapid movement of funds in a short time frame or interacted with a known exploit Wallets sending amounts to an alternative wallet which then sends the same amount an exchange Wallets has created unverified smart contracts  User Tornado Cash Compliance Monitor your user base for malicious or irregular transaction history This library detects wallets that have interacted with sanctioned protocols such as Tornado Cash. We also scan for \u201cburner wallets\u201d used to obfuscate illegitimate transfers and a growing range of indicators for malicious actors. The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Tornado Cash on August 8th, 2022.

Plus the Attestation Station is also integrated with guild from OP Labs which is coming into play with the structure of the Optimism discord and token gated channels for designated members of the governance. Building an attestation station also provides a great way to verify the authenticity of the user.

Active 3rd party Attestations       Hey @Urban_Raccoon \u2026  We are starting out with simple Q & A on this tooling we are adding to our marketplace.  If you or other members of the governance forum would like to help us gather resources by giving feedback on the questions we have posted that would be amazing.
