This why I am proposing a new governance system similar to CRV governance in which your weight in governance depend on 2 factors: 1- how many UNI tokens you have 2- the length of the vesting period of your tokens\u2026 This means that UNI governance will be controlled by long term UNI holders and will protect governance from flash loans attacks and malicious borrowers. with flash loans attacks, the attacker can borrow almost unlimited amount of UNI and make a bad proposal and pay back the loan in one block\u2026 this kind of attacks could be very difficult to stop or reverse also another possible attack is a whale or multiple whales borrow tens of millions of UNI from platforms like Compound, Aave and Cream and make a malicious proposal (like looting the treasury), this will probably cause UNI price to tank so this will let the attackers make money from looting the treasury + shorting UNI Current governance design offer big incentives for attackers especially with the growing treasury (170m UNI in the 1st year) so a new governance design that make the voting power depends on 2 factors 1- number of tokens, 2- vesting period\u2026 will make these attacks impossible and will give the governance to long term holders who have the most interest is Uniswap success ",

By introducing the preparation period with it, all the attacks become harder to execute, as it gives time for UNI holders to mobilize their voting power. And the outcome of the attacks and the cost of them become much less predictable for attackers. When it comes to lending platforms, mobilizing UNI means that lenders have to pay bigger interest. In any case, as long as there\u2019s time to respond for the Uniswap community, I don\u2019t think these attacks would happen in the first place. The only way you can make a malicious proposal to work while bypassing the governance procedures - is if you have the \u2018effective\u2019 majority of the voting power. If you do have it though, it doesn\u2019t make sense for your direct financial interests to make such a proposal go through. ",
