                    "content": "Hello Friends!  Since Andre Cronje announced StableCredit last week there has been a lot of speculation on how it compares to Maker and Dai.  I\u2019ve pooled some resources that help explain what it is and would love to hear your thoughts! Announcement - StableCredit combines tokenized debt stable coins, lending, AMMs, and single sided AMM exposure to create a completely decentralized lending protocol Bankless Interview with Andre - My main take away from this is that the MORE popular an asset is in the system (eg ETH), the less efficient drawing credit will be (in proportion to the other assets in the pool). Codeup38 Interview Thanks to @marcandu for surfacing this great twitter thread that adds more depth and the drawbacks.   twitter.com    Robert Lauko (robert_lauko)  @AndreCronjeTech @iamDCinvestor StableCredit USD is an intriguing borrowing, trading and stablecoin system with the following neat properties: - Stablecoin has an intrinsic use as a transfer currency - No interests - No governance - No liquidations - Simple and elegant system  9:01 PM - 13 Sep 2020     15          2            So my main takeaways from this \u201cresearch\u201d - (let me know if I\u2019m off!)  StableCredit system limits upside exposure to deposited assets. Seems well-equipped to enhance trading between assets and encourage a well-balanced asset pool I don\u2019t believe StableCredit holders are protected during a black swan event Arbitrage traders will be key in maintaining a balanced system. Seems like it would work well in a neutral trading market, and less efficient in bull or bear markets Doesn\u2019t seem built for real world assets.  My Questions:  What happens when collateral drops and causes StableCredit to be unbacked?  ",

                    "content": "So I did some research on this as well. My takeaways (basically all negative because I\u2019m a pessimistic bastard) are as follows: It isn\u2019t governance free Ultimately, someone needs to decide what tokens make up this pool. If you allow any token into this pool, then this can be massively abused and the pool drained of assets with actual value. In v1 chainlink governs which assets can go in the pool by providing price feeds. In essence governance is offloaded to chainlink. The Single-side AMM socializes impermanent loss into the transfer token (StableCredit) I think this was addressed in that linked twitter thread, but yeah. You can\u2019t magically make impermanent loss go away (unless you use the oracle prices rather than  the AMM ratio to set the transfer rate, but then you have other problems.) By returning StableCredit in cases where the user has suffered impermanent loss, you inflate the StableCredit token. I actually think in a black swan the StableCredit token increases in value because more of it is burned when assets are removed from the pools. That said, I think it\u2019s still horrible for borrowers. The system attempts to balance pool value equally Great in theory, in practice I\u2019m not sure how this can work given that lending and borrow demands are not equal across assets. I think the plan is to use dex aggregators to trade into this and help balance these, but I don\u2019t see how that doesn\u2019t just result in a situation where borrowers can\u2019t withdraw their collateral. EG, there is 100M of USDC collateral, and 10M of DAI collateral. Traders balance these to 55M each. Now a good portion of USDC lenders can\u2019t withdraw collateral. For stablecoins this probably doesn\u2019t matter. For volatile assets, it probably does. yETH pool is almost certainly planned to use this new system (though maybe not immediately?) This is unrelated to the StableCredit system in itself but thought was worth mentioning. This will happen directly on uniswap This part is kind of cool, there is basically no reason to duplicate the contracts, so they\u2019re just using uniswap as the AMM part of this. I do wonder what happens if someone provides ETH-StableCredit liquidity on uniswap though, probably nothing good. ",
