                    "content": "Following my post on building GitcoinDAO\u2019s legitimacy , I wanted to take a moment to articulate how Legitimacy flows in GitcoinDAO - specifically \u201clegitimacy by process\u201d. eg if a process is legitimate, the outputs of that process gain legitimacy. While there are other ways to build legitimacy (read this post for more), \u201clegitimacy by process\u201d is an important part of how to judge which decisions within the DAO are legitimate, so this post focuses on that. Goals of this post:  Inform individual members judgements of what decisions are legitimate by process (or not).  The hope is that every member of GitcoinDAO learns to judge the legitimacy of various actions on their own accord (without having to defer those judgements to more authoritative community members). Articulate why DAOs are more legitimate basis for a public goods-centric mission like Gitcoin\u2019s than companies. By mapping out how consent flows in different organizations, we can map where legitimacy comes from (and perhaps spur some interesting discussions to keep legitimacy high).   Consent of the Governed Why does consent of the governed matter? From wikipedia:  the phrase consent of the governed refers to the idea that a government\u2019s legitimacy and moral right to use state power is justified and lawful only when consented to by the people or society over which that political power is exercised.  This goes on:  This theory of consent is historically contrasted to the divine right of kings and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of colonialism  I think this is a very important (and timeless) first principle. It is a principle that especially applies today as we migrate from web2 => web3. I believe that companies (especially web2 tech giants like Meta or Google) create their legitimacy through something that looks more like a Divine Right of Kings. In web2, there are no property rights and we are all serfs on Zuckerberg\u2019s land!  Whereas well designed DAOs can derive their governance from the consent of the governed.  This creates more legitimacy & a better platform for human thriving.  How Legitimacy flows in a Company like Meta Lets take a look at how legitimacy flows in a company like Meta:  Screen Shot 2022-01-27 at 8.55.45 PM840\u00d71328 127 KB  Legitimacy (high order social acceptance) flows from shareholders to the board to the CEO, and down an org chart. Users are not asked for consent, other than perhaps to give a yay or nay to a 40 page terms of service document which they can not negotiate, only take or leave.  This terms of service document may often dictate that any disputes must happen in a court of law that is halfway around the world from the end-users. Because the users have no ability to consent to changes to the platforms ruleset, there will always be an incentive for management to try and extract from Users in order to service shareholders.  How legitimacy flows in a DAO. Here is a shot at visualizing how legitimacy flows in a DAO like GitcoinDAO:  Screen Shot 2022-01-27 at 9.23.17 PM1350\u00d71448 121 KB  Here\u2019s how the legitimacy flows from top to bottom:  Users of Gitcoin from 2017-2021 were retroactively distributed governance rights to the Grants platform. These GTC Holders then have then delegated their governance rights to someone they trust (or to themselves) - what we call Stewards. Workstreams have their own governance to manage their internal affairs. Stewards grant tokens to workstreams via proposals.  These proposals are from self-assembled members of the community who (if the proposal is accepted via the governance process ) perform work to earn further GTC.  This could just mean being hired by a workstream lead, or it could mean being granted tokens through a more distributed means like through coordination party kit or Grants | Gitcoin - depending on the governance structure of the workstream. Workstreams can also optionally choose to make legitimate decisions together that affect  other workstreams to do things with consent based decision making. Workers in workstreams then deploy changes to the Grants platform, its ruleset, its terms, or its funds, which is then used to serve Users.   Consent of the governed We repeat the principal we started with, from wikipedia:  the phrase consent of the governed refers to the idea that a government\u2019s legitimacy and moral right to use state power is justified and lawful only when consented to by the people or society over which that political power is exercised.   Legitimacy should flow in circles, not just one way. A priori, because consent (and therefore legitimacy) flows from the GTC Holders (which were seeded from Users) => the DAO => back again, the DAO is a more legitimate vessel for Gitcoin\u2019s mission than other structures.  As more surface area is opened for GTC, it is possible that this legitimacy could grow in the future.  As the Grants platform becomes an immutable, open-source, & forkable protocol in the future, there will be even less agency for DAO workers to make changes that could be forced upon users, creating a \u201ccant be evil\u201d mantra that is better than web2\u2019s \u201cdont be evil\u201d mantra. Emperically, I am a strong believer that when people who govern any organization (company, nonprofit, DAOs, or otherwise) are a member of the communities they serve, they have longer term incentive alignment with those communities and less of an incentive to juice short term profits by extracting value from those users needlessly or by externalizing harm in these communities  Feedback welcome These are just my opinions, and I\u2019d love to hear from others. What did I get right? What did I get wrong?  What further improvements could be made?  Are there any great visual maps of other DAOs we could look at for comparision?

But in the meantime, this excellent post outlines some great best practices for keeping both legitimacy and productivity high in DAOs that require diversified skillsets to work together. For the prospective contributors out there wondering how to pitch in and build GitcoinDAO\u2019s legitimacy, I think that this post very briefly covers how to be successful in finding a position in a DAO.

If this burden can\u2019t be met, the authority in question should be dismantled.  I think Gitcoin has been very successful in carrying the burden of proof and based on the diagram on How legitimacy flows in a DAO, it would be easy to dismantle any figure of authority that is illegitimate without hurting the entire DAO or workstream.

Huxwell:  I just wonder how do we make sure to not turn that into elitist governance councels   imo the solution is  to continually create & reinforce intersubjective consnensus between the people who are specialists + have context, and those that have governance power. make those two groups of people the same people.   I\u2019m also concerned with the idea that people should just be very good at one thing  the paradox here is that for any given DAO that has to do something specialized (like product development), the specialists have context + the generalists have the power ( if people only are good at one thing ) but if the specialists are also the generalists (or in tigh tcommunication with them), then you dont have that paradox. curious what @Pop @loie @KrisJ thinks!
