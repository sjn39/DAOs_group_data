Paragraph Summary SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of the greenlit bIBTA application. The domain strategy for this collateral type is to evaluate the legal ramifications of onboarding a bIBTA vault. If the legal review is favorable, technical work can continue. If the legal review is unfavorable, it follows to avoid further investment and recommend deprioritizing.  Motivation SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of the greenlit bIBTA application. The domain strategy for this collateral type is to evaluate the legal ramifications of onboarding a bIBTA vault. If the legal review is favorable, technical work can continue. If the legal review is unfavorable, it follows to avoid further investment and recommend deprioritizing. The specific amount is indexed on expected hourly costs for tier-1 level legal review by Latham & Watkins or similar, as well as Swiss-based lawyers recommended independently to provide in-depth understanding of specific regulatory implications. This SPF is necessary to allow legal teams to begin work while final reimbursement details around the budget are ironed out, and thus prevent further delays. The aim will be for this SPF to come net neutral to the overall DAO budget. All excess funds unutilized by legal review will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.  Special Purpose Fund Name Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund.  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials  The scope is strictly limited to funding legal domain work by external legal teams relating to onboarding bIBTA as a collateral type The scope of work will be to conduct an independent legal review including, among other things:  Legal risk exposure undertaken by the DAO by adopting this collateral type. Robustness of the regulatory framework the collateral is issued in. International recognition of jurisdiction-specific rules that allow this collateral type to exist. Legal risk exposure from onboarding a vault for a token that is explicitly restricted for sale, minting, and redemption by US citizens. Robustness of tokenizer-specific implementation of rule and regulations related to DLT-issued ledger-based securities. Other open legal review questions to be added during RFC.   The deliverable should be a legal memo or similar summarizing key legal risks the DAO faces by onboarding a bIBTA vault. The external legal team should either have or recommend an independent country-specific legal team with deep familiarity of DLT-related rules and regulations in Switzerland.   Funding Breakdown  On funding, the SPF will be used to finance scope-limited legal due diligence relating to onboarding bIBTA as a vault type. Excess funds will be held in the multisig until the work is complete. Unspent funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.

Better solutions might always come during the rest of RFC.  image953\u00d7138 99.7 KB  However, understand your point and I take the feedback - what I propose as a solution is that we add a legal overwatch from another CU to observe all correspondence and examine all the work products. I know @layerzero  from SES has relevant legal experience so maybe he would be a good fit? @ACREinvest my experience tend to differ as we done just that @christiancdpetersen  . The DAO is obviously not the client, it would be my legal entity as stated somewhere else. While some legal firm have concerns to this construct, we were able to be onboarded at Latham, Shearman and Ogier which are Tier 1. Ogier agreed for a summary of memo that was published. The legal representation for DAOs is a big problem that we don\u2019t plan to resolve here. We are just following what was done to date and what will be done for MIP65 as well (still unclear on budgeting and execution for this one, so a SR SPF might come soon but in weekly process). @Doo_StableLab this is not a proposal to change mandates. We discussed this on the Collateral Status Index Update Call. We are doing what we agreed we would do.

This raises the possibility that a second and final SPF may be required towards the end of the month to complete the work. As of today, our estimates are as follows  12-16k CHF from top-tier Swiss legal firms to cover compliance with Swiss law max. 20k USD from North Lakes Legal to coordinate project 40-60k USD from a white-shoe US firm to cover US implications  This SPF was aiming for the lower bound of these estimates. We wanted to communicate this ahead of time so that people are aware during the voting period how we are thinking of sequencing this. To pay for a white-shoe US law firm, we may need to request a further 30-50k in three to four weeks to complete the domain work. With all legal work, particularly in this space, it is hard to pin down exact time estimates from lawyers. By then, hopefully we have a more accurate assessment of what it might cost. Thank you for your understanding - open to your questions or comments should you have any. ",

For this SPF, no commitments or endorsements are being provided by CES. If the community wishes Strategic Finance (SF) to do this scope of work, please communicate your preference in the current Governance Poll. If the poll passes, we will honor the community\u2019s request and SF will procure the work. As a general statement relating to the collateral onboarding process and most RWAs, there appears to be a disconnect in the roles and responsibilities with collateral applicants and MakerDAO. Based upon my limited conversations/observations to date, collateral applicants do their best to put an idea forward and MakerDAO assumes a lot of responsibility and cost to make the deal happen. Given the current state of the crypto markets and Maker revenue, I think we\u2019re all feeling pressure to \u201cget deals done.\u201d I get it! My suggestion is that we take a quick pause and evaluate roles/responsibilities for the RWA deals in the CSI. In the traditional finance industry, there are well know practices that identifies who does what and who pays for what. Since each deal is different, the level of work to be completed is different. An asset backed by a name brand investment company will probably require less work than one of a novel structure. If Maker decides to take on more responsibility for the deal since we think it will get done faster, I\u2019ll honor that request. Right now, it\u2019s challenging to provide what that looks like since the risk, return, and legal need to be evaluated (similar to an investment committee memo) and a fairness opinion needs to be provided by a third party. I agree with a comment I saw somewhere in the replies\u2026this will probably cost Maker more than this SPF request. If that is true, it supports Maker determining who is responsible for paying for the work, ahead of time. CES is starting to understand the true startup costs (and ongoing costs) of doing an RWA deal. I am not ready to share the data due to the limited nature of the analysis. I think we have a lot of room for improvement by adopting normal practices of doing deals. ",

This question is broader and more strategic that the current discussion. Happy to have CES facilitate that. There is the question of the legal fund, what to do with all the stuck RWA, \u2026 Nevertheless, I don\u2019t agree that wanting to change things is a good reason to blocking processes especially without a clear picture of the timing. The problem of blocked short-term bonds initiative was highlighted 23 days ago with the current solution we are following. The opportunity cost is significant, most MKR holders agree on the strategic importance of short-term bonds for MakerDAO (again a declaration of intent was voted) and, I guess, want to see results. In the CSI spreadsheet, it was written that the project based funding request could be used for Backed (and CES maintain this file). This probably lead the the misconception that CES was supportive.  image962\u00d7102 87 KB  The current task is to get the domain work done.

                    "content": "I realize the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process can be a little confusing. The process is well documented and lives here, https://collateral.makerdao.com/. As for the Greenlight Poll, its purpose is as a first filter, by the community, into the COB process. Once a collateral application is Greenlit, it\u2019s up to the domain teams, with input from a variety of stakeholders, as to the order in which the collateral moves through the process. To determine this order, it might be necessary for the domain teams to do a bit of evaluation before deciding if domain work will be done. I think it\u2019s important that we understand the scope and costs for all RWA deals. Specifically with Backed Finance, there are outstanding questions and part of those are attempting to be addressed by this SPF. Based upon the finality of the PRF vote last week, I think it makes sense for this SPF to exist since the MKR holders need to decide if Maker wants to pay for the professional services. CES does not plan to pay for professional services if we identify those are the responsibility of the collateral applicant. Professional service resources contracted by CES are used at the discretion of CES for collateral onboarding and management. Other groups are free to contract with the same resources if so desired. In addition, CES is currently doing an evaluation to understand the technical implementation strategy of Backed Finance. While the details are different, past experimental collateral onboarding attempts have been challenging and consumed a lot of time without yielding significant results. We also need to consider the relative priorities of other Greenlit collateral to see if those have a higher impact to Maker based upon the scope and expected return. As of right now, the status of the collateral application for Backed Finance is Greenlit and the collateral stakeholders are evaluating the next steps. ",
