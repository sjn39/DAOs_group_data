The full list of final results & payout amounts can be found here. We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Tuesday, April 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, April 15th.  Options to vote on:  Ratify the round results  You ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GR13 final payout amounts through the non-custodial GR13 deployment contract.  Request further deliberation  You do not ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.  TLDR from the GR13 Results Post:   Grants Round 13 (GR13) ran from March 9-24, 2022   Over $4.6M will be distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.2M came from the combined matching pools and $1.4M was contributed by the community.   GR13 featured 13 rounds:  The main round Nine ecosystem rounds: ENS, Radicle, NFT Ecosystem, Uniswap, ZKTech, Polygon, Open Gaming, Algorand and Olympus Three cause rounds: Climate Solutions, Human Longevity, and Support for Ukraine    In GR13, we continued on the same main pool structure as GR12 \u2013 in GR12, the community chose to pilot a single pool approach with a 2.5% maximum cap for the main round rather than a category-based setup. GR13 featured the same structure, which again was largely successful in distributing funding to a broad set of projects.   In both GR12 and GR13 side round matching pools had approximately double the total funds as the main pool. We\u2019re excited to see continued momentum with supporting ecosystem & cause rounds as we head into GR14.   Also, stay tuned for FDD\u2019s upcoming Governance Brief for a sybil detection overview.

That said, a grant could have raised funds from multiple rounds - for example, the Main Round and an Ecosystem or Cause Round (e.g., the Polygon Round, the Climate Round, etc.) which is why many have total match amounts well over $30K in the \u2018Totals\u2019 tab. To see the $30K cap in action in the results, go to the \u2018Round-by-Round\u2019 tab and scroll down to row 168 - you can see that the top grants in \u2018gr13-gitcoin-main\u2019 all have exactly $30,000 in matching.
