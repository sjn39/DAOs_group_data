We have extended the sprint due to a team offsite in Lisbon  for the LISCON conference. Our next sprint will start on Monday the 25th of October. This release includes some new features that should make it easier for users to manually verify the validity of Executive Votes and the related Executive Spells. It also includes improvements to linked resources, such as documentation or relevant Governance Forum posts. In addition the release includes some visual improvements and consistency fixes. Last but not least; this release contains a ton of changes behind the scenes! We have improved the code structure of the Governance Portal and migrated our testnet setup from Kovan to G\u00f6rli, in line with other Maker CUs. DUX team is eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this release! Feel free to reach out on our Discord or use our renewed public feedback board on https://makergovernance.canny.io/   Featured changes  Spell Details Tab   Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_4.47.14_PM.png926\u00d7855 74.4 KB   Ever since removing the \u2018On-chain Effects\u2019 tab from the Governance portal due to an API issue, it has been one of the most-requested features to be re-introduced. Today we are adding the Spell Detail tab to the Executive detail page\u2014a more elaborate tab that includes details about the Executive Spell related to the Executive Proposal. In the near future we will re-add the on-chain effects section to this tab, once the required API is back online. One notable addition to the Spell Detail tab is the executive hash, returned by the spell\u2019s description property. This hash can help verify that the Executive Proposal spell you\u2019re looking at matches the Executive Proposal which is included (as a hash) in the Spell smart contract. By running the raw markdown through a Keccak-256 hash function, you can see that the hashes are identical.  Vote Breakdown Progress Bar Color   Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_5.59.55_PM.png1025\u00d7272 16.2 KB   Previously each vote option in a plurality poll was colored the same. Based on some feedback, we thought it would improve comprehensibility to have these colors coordinated with the colors we use on the other areas of the UI to indicate \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cAbstain\u201d votes.  Improved Linked Resources    We have added a new section to the right sidebar to include more relevant and useful links to resources, based on the page\u2019s context. These links should help users new to Maker governance more easily find what they are looking for. Maker\u2019s governance system is complex and best understood when researched incrementally, which is what we tried to enable with this change. We intend to also make improvements to the governance documentation found at https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/  Full Release Notes   Add Spell Detail tab Add corresponding colors to vote breakdown progress display Add new poll category tags Fix incorrect differentiation between when a spell can be cast with regards to office hours  Format dates consistently across pages Add support for G\u00f6rli/Goerli testnet Maker Protocol deployment Add improved linked resources to sidebar Rearchitect code structure into modules Improve delineation between ranked choice and plurality poll types Various other UI/UX improvements  ",
