                    "content": "Maker governance is still in a beautiful early phase - call it springtime. One defining feature of such a early phase is that there is little separation between roles in the organization nor much in the way of hierarchy. Maker is however outgrowing this phase at a rapid pace and there could be time for a move towards a slightly more conventional structure. The amount of information that needs to be processed is steadily increasing and putting Maker governance under stress. Maker governance separation of roles1280\u00d7720 103 KB How did we end up in this situation? Largely because of two things: first of all because decentralized organizations have never really done much delegation and second because on a strategic level the Maker Foundation provided the long term guidance needed. As a result the Maker community was stuck with what remained, which has largely been day-to-day operational issues. The net result is the governance we have today. When stressed organizations have two options: either automate or delegate. The first steps towards automation are already underway in the form of MIP27, I will in this article argue we start doing the same with regards to delegation. My motivation behind this is simple - the need to scale. With the present state of affairs Maker is not able to onboard more than roughly two types of collateral per month, which is far below what we need in order to dethrone Tether. Simply taking the present process and multiplying it will not be sufficient as Maker governance voting is already an expensive clickfest and multiplying this x10 or x20 is simply not workable. Therefore we need to both delegate and automate. A spoonful of delegation will remove the issue of voting for proposals that sail through with 95%-100% of the vote anyway, an easy picking with regards reducing the overhead cost of Maker governance. It will also empower Domain Facilitators and so facilitate future automation in their respective domains. Delegate authority to domain facilitators1280\u00d7720 70.9 KB I hereby propose MIP_delegation_of_authority for a pre-MIP discussion. The MIP empowers Domain Facilitators to send specific issues straight to Executive Vote, bypassing the Governance Poll. Which issues? The typical issues that get close to 100% of the vote anyway. I plan to detail this with Domain Facilitator input if this pre-MIP passes. One example are Oracles where I have yet to remember an oracle proposal that did not go through. Another is Collateral Onboarding where the bad apples can be separated out by anyone that did not invest in OneCoin. I want to delegate my voting power to the Risk Team on this issue, I fully trust them to do the right thing. At the moment all the November 30 polls fall into this category where the onboarding of renBTC, 6s Capital and Uniswap as well as whitelisting of Yearn are all looking to be approved with respectively 99.85%, 100%, 98.7% and 100% of the vote. Let\u2019s streamline this! The MIP_delegation_of_authority is not imperative, meaning Domain Facilitators are free to subject decisions to a Governance Poll if they feel the decision is important or potentially divisive. Feedback appreciated.    Do you think this is a good idea?  Yes No Abstain Other - please explain     0 voters     ",

We should streamline them just because adding administrative work doesn\u2019t make sense. The best example for \u201cuseless\u201d governance work in my mind is setting SF for stablecoins with two failed polls. I think (may be wrong) that no result would have changed the world. The monetary and risk impact was low and temporary anyway. Thinking on how to improve governance like your post can change stuff significantly and impact Maker for the years to come. Just like the decision to onboard RWA or the decision (not taken) to decrease the collateral value per DAI. We probably should have spent more time on those strategic items. For RWA (just an example, because I\u2019m struggling with this one), I try to put minor decision to the community like here. Participation is low as I expect people have better to do than go deep in the implementation. Nevertheless, sometimes you get quite interesting feedbacks. The plan is to have a gov poll of all these micro-decisions (to avoid having x governance polls). But participation is low and having something set in stone is painful as well. We also might need to change stuff the next day because real life is not a clean theory. Transparency on what the domain teams is working is important so Governance can check and yell if needed. But having everything to be discussed with all governance is not efficient. It\u2019s somewhat moving from a Command and Control model to a Mission Command one. ",

                    "content": "    Planet_X:  I hereby propose MIP_delegation_of_authority for a pre-MIP discussion.   FYI:  In my experience you can\u2019t delegate Authority without also \u2018assigning responsibility\u2019.  In too many organizations authority to get something done DOES NOT lay with a single authority, it often requires coordination of multiple authorities to complete a single responsibility. Just keep this in mind with this MIP.     Aaron_Bartsch:  The problem with term limits long term is that it incentivizes short term thinking of mandated actors in order to implement their authority. If you know you\u2019re not going to be in a position long term you have more incentive to think about what can be done sooner rather than seeing the forest through the trees.   I completely agree with this observation.   Far too often there is this idea that someone with power (i.e. authority) should never be allowed to hold this for any length of time out of concern for abuse of power, forms of nepotism.  While these are issues, given that governance is the one to carry out the final stamps of approval on many key actions, I don\u2019t see this as a problem. Today far too many organizations don\u2019t even have long term planning groups with people who themselves come from, not just one but ideally, more than one authority/power roles as these people have the best view of what the organization does because they have done most of it.  These groups tend to act in advisory capacities to corporate boards or high level management. Now if this is going to be a who can win at politics contest then perhaps there could be reason to have \u2018term limits\u2019 but honestly if there are clear ways an \u2018elected\u2019 authority can be removed there shouldn\u2019t be too much problem.   The real issue here will be conflict of interest issues and how to be transparent about those as they crop up. I have argued Domain Facilitators should just do the micro work defining a proposal (say changes to SF, DC, collateral onboarding) and put their report up for review for a reasonable length of time for community to review and provide feedback. Then just on-chain poll yes-no the resultant DF package.  After this process completes governance should just yeah/nay the executive.   This whole governance micromanaging everything Maker in the end will become wholly impractical and this is why some form of heirarchy is desirable. The debate won\u2019t be around whether to delegate authority and responsibility, but how to structure it. Lastly, I want people to carefully consider robustness against decentralization in this authority/responsbility model.   In my own analysis on this I conclude that decentralized organizations will be less efficient in resource allocation (people) than centralized organizations because it will take at least 2x amount of people and effort to get that 1 level personel redundancy.   Quality assurance and fall back costs more in decentralized vs. centralized organizations to make sure that authorities are acting consistently and have checks/balances.  24/7/365 organizations will need to be at least 3 people deep in key positions (often this is really 5) with trainees and retirees simply due to nature of 24/7365 operations and staffing rotation (vacation, sick, changing jobs, training considerations/time etc.).

Building out a decentralized organizational framework is definitely one of the largest issues we will face and I look forward to seeing how that evolves. ",

Slightly off topic from the purpose of the post, but\u2026     MakerMan:  In my own analysis on this I conclude that decentralized organizations will be less efficient in resource allocation (people) than centralized organizations because it will take at least 2x amount of people and effort to get that 1 level personel redundancy.   Something to consider is how we define the value of a decentralized org. Centralized organization are measured through efficiency, and I argue that\u2019s the wrong value to measure to decentralized organizations. C-orgs will always win at efficiency. While we should try to be as efficient as possible, IMHO, we should optimize the opportunity for some of the values of distributed networks: more creative solutions (from the variety of people in the network), resilience through redundancy, and personal/team autonomy (with the right structure).

Assuming they will be community driven\u2013I got to believe some of their portfolio community projects will follow an orthodox style of decentralization\u2013by the community, for the community.
