Not only would this tax users and holders to the sole benefit of miners, on a user first network, it would set a precedent where by miners may make similar tantrum-like threats for any change in the future that MAY impact their short term bottom lines over clear improvements to the protocol. Ethereum is a user focused network, not a miner focused network. Horse trading with miners is not necessary. The dynamic of mining market competitiveness, the function of the difficulty algorithm, and the strong contingency of social coordination to mitigate attacks by miners are strong enough deterrents that I believe any such \u201cshows of force\u201d are merely theatrical, not a threat to be taken seriously given the motivations under game theory. The \u201cthreat\u201d this proposal attempts to address is a reduced security posture due to an exodus of miners who can no longer remain profitable. But in fact it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s an obfuscated ultimatum. The cost to attack Ethereum via rented hash attacks if miners leave due to negative short term profit impact is an irrelevant threat if 51% of the network can already mobilize via a show of force to a) enforce their will on governance via fear, or b) actually attack if so inclined. Scapegoating rented hash attacks is silly if your next move against 1559 is to prove coordination of 51% of the hashrate is possible. The only counter proposal acceptable to such a threat, if made real by colluding hashrate, is an abandonment of now verifiably flawed PoW ",

                    "content": "Can you explain how 2 years was decided as a mitigation time? The EIP\u2019s motivation section talks about the risk being \u201cA sudden drop in PoW mining rewards could result in a sudden precipitous decrease in mining profitability that may drive miners to auction off their hashrate to the highest bidder while they figure out what to do with their now \u201cworthless\u201d hardware. If enough hashrate is auctioned off in this way at the same time, an attacker will be able to rent a large amount of hashing power for a short period of time at relatively low cost and potentially attack the network.\u201d All of the above focuses on short-term security issues from the addition of EIP-1559\u2019s burn model that would be implemented instantly one block to the next - the \u2018cliff\u2019. Yet EIP-3368 is trying to help smooth out the reduction in block rewards over a 2 year period. However, there is no substantiated reason why this would be a 2 year problem for Ethereum. On top of this, the block reward sounds to be scheduled to \u201cdecrease slightly every block\u201d indicating a linear decay. Meaning for the first 12 months issuance will be higher then a flat 2 ETH per block reward. Then the second 12 months issuance will be lower then a flat 2 ETH per block. The second 12 month period then being the time where the long term supply is \u2018made whole\u2019 within that 2 year window. The problem is the likely hood of the merge of PoW to PoS not occurring within 2 years is basically nil. This means this will almost certainty result in a net increase to issuance - leading the chain away from Ethereum\u2019s goal of \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d. Simply put, the 2 year decay period is far out of balance with what is ultimately a rather short lived issue. ",

What I want to ensure is there is a real plan, implemented and ready to trigger that addresses a mass exodus. Ethereum should have that projection period. The algorithm has 0 protection against a 51% attack. Other networks with Ethash have been successfully attacked. The know how, the scripts and intention is there. The fact we have to debate is shocking. The force projection of Ethereum is nearly 2.5x ATH. This means the total network PoW GPU/ASIC hashpower is profound. Much of that hashrate is very new participants. The attack vector is there. Nicehash, MiningRigRentals, Cudaminer and about 10 other separate broker services all broker hash to the highest bidder.

Given recent events I 110% understand why that would be the primary thought, but truly I was more-so referencing the \u2018normal\u2019 timeline where the merge can is released without the quick / fast merge approach. It seems your first paragraph was geared towards that. Which is appreciated the response, but I\u2019m not sure struck the heart of my concern / question. I\u2019ll try to narrow down \u2014 by the time London is released w/ 1559 included the Beaconchain will have been running for 6 to 7 months. Assume the price / MEV / fee rates show a security risk and 3368 is launched, this means a 2 year decay window puts us to mid-2023. What is the basis for thinking this will be an issue going into mid 2023? 2023 is also notable because even with the old (and now defunct) Phase 0 / 1 / 2 model the docking was still expected in 2022. Given changes to that model to eliminate Phases all together and the general sentiment to merge before sharding (even  talked about outside the scope of 1559) it seems going into 2023 is essentially not going to happen and even a late 2022 is unlikely. Even the docking page of the Ethereum website is guessing 2021/2022 - https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/docking/ I understand track records / our lack of crystal balls can not lead us to a definitive statement, but surely a mid-2023 phase out is very conservative for a merge date. Mid 2022 puts us 1 year out from London and would be a more reasonable estimate for a merge date (even including the testing you noted). So what I\u2019m getting at is 2 years just seems far too long for something like this and doesn\u2019t seem based on any meaningful metrics. All of which looks beyond the point I hit on initially - this is a security issue that is relatively short term (think months, not years). As you noted, a cliff. So the merits of smoothing out make sense but the decay period seems very far off. While my opinion is meaningless on the grand scale of things, I would wager a majority of the community would see 2 years as a non-starter. I don\u2019t see how this gets traction at all unless that window is at least 1 year or less\u2026 likely even 6 months or less. The 2 year length makes the compromise of a 1 base reward essentially meaningless to the broad community since it will potentially get cut out completely or more likely just shortly lived. I wouldn\u2019t even begin to support this until the decay was at the 1 year or less length. ",

Miners do come and go and the market ebbs and flows, 100% agree, This is how eth was fine during the 2017 ATH to 2020 Lows of 89.xx; Mining retracted quite a bit, but benifited from the Bitmain E3 sunsetting due to DAG file decrease. Nearly 20+ TH fell off during that time, mainly E3\u2019s, which kept the force projection of GPUs at the time 110+ TH able to participate. We are taking 410+ TH and by July with the current growth thrend possibly 600+ TH. That will wholesale rely on average BR 2 + 2 Trans fee and 1500-1800 Eth Price. That drops to 2 flat or just over 2 from MEV ; the numbers can be up to 20% HR drop. If we are looking at 800 Eth price in July for whatever reason but BR 2 + 2-5 Trans fee that will go away due to 1559, now we move from 600+ TH to 300-350TH sustainable.   That 200-300TH will find homes or turn off. This is the time a would be attacker places a buy order on brokers. And before you tell me someone would pay if they had the chance to take down Eth, we live in a reality a NFT goes for 69m dollars, of which a Eth competitor TRX casually threw a bid on. Not saying Justin would attack, but I dont want to take the risk. This notion of paying a cartel or compromising with miners is an unfortunate mindset. As a advocate for mining since 2013, putting over 7000+ hours of content out there teaching people how to participate on networks, of which 4k+ on ethereum alone resulting in nearly 5.5 million views we are considered a shitshow. I would argue to say the engagement, involvement and value add as a Miner I have brought hundreds of million of value to this ecosystem of participants. I didn\u2019t have to do that and I don\u2019t need your thanks for it, but the misguidance that the mining participant is your enemy is misplaced. Lastly and in closing. The previous show of force may have been partially short sighted, I agree and mentioned such on YouTube today in front of 900+ live viewers in a 1.5h discussion. But the threat has not been seriously considered with a bunch of people not providing a lick of data and just standing behind the past that ethereum is safe. I see the existential threat to Ethereum and I have no doubt others willing to harm it do to. This is not a time to take a \u2018minimal security model\u2019 mindset.

Commodities dont decrease their supply\u2026 (More fleshed out argument at https://coingeek.com/ethereum-2-0-is-an-unexploded-regulatory-bomb/  + https://medium.com/@craig_10243/proof-of-unregistered-security-798f4df2fbb9 ) (would this EIP solve this because supply would not be decreasing if BR was increased? should net out?) (I disagree slightly with the author, POS isnt the main threat that would get eth classified as a security, its deflation\u2026 commodities dont reduce the # in circulation\u2026) (for example, 51% attack under POS, you destroy their eth with a hardfork, and you run afoul of U.S. securities laws immediately and yep, Ethereum isnt registered either\u2026) Reasonable minds can agree to disagree on whether the government would do this, but based on what ive seen, most governments are looking to shut down or restrict crypto heavily/regulate it. They would probably jump at the opportunity. Not sure how we could prove this is a threat though until its too late, so this a minor point against implementing deflation.   I believe the risk is large with EIP1559, im most concerned about the nicehash attack scenario which this EIP3368 would help prevent, if revenue to miners decreases significantly, so does the upfront cost to initiate an attack. Once the price becomes low enough for someone to begin an attack, it becomes self sustaining since any rational 51% attacker would censor the other 49%, and they can double spend / make off-chain bets to make back any upfront cost+profit.  (once the 49% is censored, it becomes rational to join the attackers) (miners can centralize on nicehash faster than devs can release the merge and respond\u2026) Hence, best to not allow a chance of that happening.   While i believe in the policy of minimum viable issuance, i dont believe in waiting for an attack to occur before you acknowledge it as a possibility. The nicehash scenario is a real threat given the anticipated revenue drops for miners, even ignoring difficulty. Although eth\u2019s price could rise to match, theres no guarantee it will. Hence, in my view, this is a necessary BR increase to compensate for the immediate drop off in revenue that 1559 will cause for miners. A sudden drop in revenue(1559 without 3368) is a strong motivation to attack the network, since other coins will have no time to attempt to fill the space (no other options), most miners will see dropping gpu resale prices and refuse to get out (in hopes they can recoup their investment), and that leaves us with a massive amount of hashrate looking for another home, all at the same time. (thats how you end up with a nicehash attack) This EIP would instead spread that time spent looking for another home through a year+, as the less power efficient cards would be dropped off the network first, while the rest remain profitable\u2026 gradually dropping off and finding new homes. This seems like a much smaller risk, especially since gradually dropping hashrate will cause difficulty to adjust accordingly.   GPU miners have less incentive to attack the network before the merge, their hardware remains with atleast some value after the merge. We can disagree over how much value, but it is some atleast. ASICS retain zero value after the merge, that provides a much stronger incentive to attack the network before the merge. Personally im concerned ASICS will continue to proliferate before the merge, if we decrease eth mining profits to such a point that GPUs are priced out, we end up with ASICs dominating, and much more difficulty and risk with a 2.0 merge.   It has not been lost on me that ASICS have largely been quiet or lightly supportive on EIP-1559, it isnt a threat to them, its an opportunity to push out gpu mining hash. (and thus gain more control and profits) GPU miners can threaten, but it is much more difficult for them to coordinate an attack than it would be if ASICs dominated the chain. (as ASICS have a good shot of getting atleast 50% of hashrate before the merge already imo, without any changes, pushing out the gpu miners should be regarded as a real threat, ideally we have both groups continue hashing)   Im of the opposite opinion of others in this thread, this BR increase is necessary to ensure profits remain high enough for miners until the merge is ready that attacks remain prohibitively expensive. Without it, the upfront attack cost drops drastically. (and once an attack is ongoing, it can be self-perpetuating) It also ensures we dont end up with an ASIC-only chain anytime soon.  (without a BR increase, less efficient setups will drop off in mass, entirely GPUs dropping off, no ASIC will be inefficient enough to be brought down by EIP-1559, but the revenue drop combined with difficulty increase will likely push out massive amounts of GPU hashrate, resulting in ASIC centralization) Best case scenario in my book is to implement this change and rush to POS ASAP, hopefully complete the merge before ASICS represent a majority of hash.   I also disagree that this would set a precedent for arbitrary changes based on social pressure, this EIP3368 isnt about social pressure and thats not the reasoning put forth for it, the goal is to deal with the network security issue that exists due to a sudden drop off in profits that will occur with EIP1559, smoothing this drop off out over a longer time period than 1 block is very beneficial for the security of the network, and it happens to be beneficial for miners aswell. Its worth noting, 3eth block reward would just about match current revenues with post EIP-1559 revenues, disregarding difficulty of course. A decrease from that 3BR point is still an overall decrease in miner profits (when factoring in lost fee revenues), its just this EIP would spread the gradual drop in miner profits out over a longer time period, and EIP1559 would cause the drop immediately in a single block. Hence, it deals with a legitimate security issue contained within EIP 1559, no one can predict how the majority of hashrate will respond to a sudden 40% drop in revenue (thus, initial attack cost dropping 40%) so it doesnt make sense to play a game of chicken with them! Miners can attack and cause significant damage faster than devs can release the merge in response. Users think that the miners knowing devs will rush POS will stop an attack before it starts, but when hashrate becomes unprofitable, they no longer care about the \u201ctheyll kill me sooner\u201d threat\u2026 they\u2019re already dead at that point\u2026 It makes sense to not risk it, based on the calculations ive seen, the drop off in revenues is a serious threat with EIP-1559 alone, couple in the difficulty rise, and we have a real security threat that needs addressing If POS is ready and able for an emergency merge, it should be done ASAP, if not, it shouldnt be used as a talking point as to why we dont need to give miners concessions. Clearly, if our other option is not ready, we must give concessions, or were playing a game of chicken with a $200bn network. My vote is 1559+3368+969(whenever someone proposes 969 again?) in the same hardfork 1559 for the predictable fees, 3368 to deal with the short term security risks posed by 1559, and 969 to atleast make future asic centralization more difficult (more might be needed prior to the merge to address this, personally i think people are drastically underestimating the progress ASICs are making currently due to a lack of hard proof) Edit to expound on the last point about ASICs: (I could also get behind 1057, but i understand thats a non-starter.) I simply do not believe that the recent hashrate increases weve seen could have been entirely gpus based on inventory numbers\u2026, given the magnitude of the rise, my person opinion is ASICS are probably 10%<x<20% of the network already. Ive heard their main downfall currently is the chip shortages, but this wont last,  and shouldnt be bet on continuing. I\u2019d like to see more proposed EIPs dealing with ASIC resistance. The break-glass moment (1057 becoming a necessity due to ASIC 40-51%) has a high liklihood of occuring before the merge can be completed in my opinion even if we pass 1559+3368+969. (simply due to the market forces, theres a massive amount of capital funding ASIC development and manufacturing currently, and they know they need to do this ASAP) (this has to do with EIP3368 because 3368 addresses the short term security issues of 1599, one of those security issues is that EIP1559 would further the domination of ASICs over GPUs by decreasing rewards to a level potentially unsustainable for GPUs, but entirely sustainable for ASICs.)

The best case would be to complete the merge asap along with this change, it still decreases overall issuance the sooner the merge is completed, even if BR is increased. If it decays to an unsustainable level before the merge is ready, then an emergency hardfork and another BR increase becomes necessary. (taking time and effort, and potentially causing danger if the foresight isnt there to do this before it becomes a large problem) at a BR of 1, id question whether anything but ASICs remain viable, and that not only increases the ASIC centralization threat, but increases the attack threat from all the sidelined gpus who cant make enough mining \u201cregularly\u201d now. If the timelines too long and overestimates the length until the merge, then theres little loss, the BR would have decayed mildly faster, but the merge came early anyways, and that means less total issuance (less time spent paying miners). (the BR is still decaying, and will likely get below 2 by the time any merge happens, meaning its got a good chance of actually being less total issuance, id love to see someone do a calculation on this to see what would be necessary to make the total issuance the same through the two scenarios) If the timelines too short and underestimates the length until the merge, then it either A. requires an emergency hardfork, and a BR increase (or some other solution that pays miners more so they break even on power and keep mining) or B. results in centralization of GPU miners on nicehash and other attack vectors (or sold/turned off), and centralizes ASIC control of the main chain as they\u2019ll still make enough at a BR of 1 likely. edit: +(part of the security issue created by 1559 that 3368 attempts to solve) If this change is implemented, and the hard fork goes without a hitch, theres no reason the tapering rate couldnt be increased, or BR straight up lowered, its much better to do that, using the benefit of our knowledge then, rather than attempting to figure out a perfect timeline now.

EIP1559 has been informed to miners almost half a year in advance, so has the plan to merge with the beacon chain. The only reason to give in to these condtions would be a credible threat posed by miners - by mining empty blocks, censoring transactions or else disrupting infrastructure. A hard fork is not a credible threat if it coexists with the current network, as most users are not interested in a fork not approved by EF. Some points for consideration:  It is too early to conclude whether miners will enter the war of attrition which is mining empty blocks or censoring the network. It is war of attrition because it involves miners taking short-term losses in return for perceived long-term gains. Whether these long-term gains exist is debatable too. ETH price will likely drop, and ethereum\u2019s reputation will be tarnished. This harms miner revenues. There is yet to be any statement from miners saying they will be peaceful once this EIP is accepted. Nor is there a way to hold them accountable to any such statement they might make. Accepting this EIP is effectively admitting miner authority over PoW consensus, which means miners get unlimited authority to propose even more brazen changes in the near future. Unlimited authority includes but is not limited to arbitrary increases in block rewards or block size (gas limit). Miners will then be rationally interested in ensuring the merge never happens as per the PoW consensus, it\u2019ll have to happen in a centralised fashion outside of the proof of work chain Giving miners the authority to change block rewards sets a bad precedent for all PoW chains including bitcoin. A similar attack occurring on other chains like bitcoin would further tarnish the reputation and prices of both ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole. The facts that we are merging to proof of stake or that EIP1559 is being implemented are not relevant to the fact that giving into miners demands sets a precedent for all proof of work chains. Namely that miners can arbitrarily change block rewards at any point in time if they are sufficiently coordinated.  ",

Let\u2019s work on solid founded principals and honor what all POW coins have done traditionally in the past and pay the miners the fees for transactions. Price should not be dictated by arbitrary manipulaition of the supply. This will only create short term gains and longer term declines in market confidence. Monitary policy in crypto was designed to be hands off and it seems the new influx of wallstreet investors thinks this is Fed2.0 and can manipulate supply to get what they want out of price. We already screwed up in the beginning with the DAO hack resulting in ETC chain split. Let\u2019s not repeat history again and make the wrong manipulated decision. This time history may not be so kind. If we want to burn fees then it should be done after the merge in POS. POW has always rewarded txn fees to the miners. 1559 is a mistake with the fees being burned and the miners reaction to it is admirable as they have the best intentions of the network to maintain security. They are doing their job as the arbitors of security. It is the ones trying to change monitary policy before switching to POS and kicking the miners in the balls just because they can are the ones to blame, not the miners. ",

There is no need to throw miners under the bus for (potential) increase in eth price. The reward is not worth the risk. Mining needs to remain profitable and attractive until the POS shift is ready (and I mean ready, not rushed through without essential features) and this is one of the only viable ways achieve that.

Cutting revenue from miners with brute force and without even trying to really talk it out with them? You cannot simply change the plane direction in mid flish as you please without a broad consensus. This just show the lack of decentralization in ETH in my opinion. If some simply have the power to change things on a whim without broad consensus then ETH is just a glorified centralized database that is super slow and super expensive. Also what I find really disturbing is the blatant missinformation being streamed and written about everywhere. Blogs, youtube etc\u2026 Most of that is spreading a lot of wrong info:  Miners will try to 51% attack ETH. Completely wrong. Miners cannot attack the network only the pool with 51% can. And it was clearly stated multiple times its just a show that 51% can be mustered not that any actual attack will happen EIP-1559 will reduce the fees. Obviously this is wrong EIP-1559 will make ETH deflationary. It might, but there is 0 guarantee that this will actually happen. If you really understand the fee structure and economics of ETH its very unlikely it will become deflationary.  My biggest gripe with all this is that there is tons of people not really understandting the PoW or the ETH project in general at the technical level. They simply dream of short term pumps and gains disregarding the important things. I do hope this will not backfire back badly. ",

Oh yeah, its totally a subsidy of miners to drop their rewards 25% immediately, and 75% over time. /s lol EIP1559 with 100% burn would be a nearly 50% immediate drop in revenues There are less security issues with a 25% immediate cut, and a gradual drop off beyond that, than there are with a 50% immediate cut. Namely, the ability to watch and respond to see if their hardware is actually absorbed by the market! Only the naive would believe that miners will sell their cards while gpu resale prices are dropping. They will hold them once they see resale prices drop. Then, you have a significant portion of gpu hash offline/on nicehash\u2026 (ASIC centralization threat, gpu attack threat) EIP1559 is a 40-50% Drop in revenues, on top of a possible 50% difficulty rise between now and then, I doubt eth has any chance of remaining the most profitable after this. Even EIP1559 alone would drop revenues enough that some hashrate would begin switching out to other coins and nicehash, and that ignores the difficulty rise, which will only increase as ASICs proliferate between now and then. \u201cno such thing as risk free business\u201d Miners are well aware of this, when their Ethereum opportunity ends, (when a gpu becomes unprofitable to mine with), they are either sold, used for attack, or their other purposes. The users seem to not realize that their business isnt risk free either\u2026 decentralized mining and eth remaining #1 in profitability reduces the users risk from an attack on the network they use substantially, if eth is no longer #1 profitable for miners, users will learn quickly why they need to be\u2026 Difficulty rise alone through July threatens to make a significant portion of GPU hashrate unprofitable, couple in EIP1559, and you have an existential threat to GPU miners on your network. If you want to keep a majority of hash in GPU\u2019s, and you want EIP1559, 3368 is a good start along with 969, but 3368 still doesnt remove the risk, merely reduces the risks created by 1559 by about half. (25% drop vs 50%) I urge you to reconsider if you want any significant % of your hash to be GPUs. If your fine with ASICs controlling 51% By august, by all means, stay the course and do 1559 without any compromises. ",

I would rather prefer to keep EIP 1559 as it is without a single change and to avoid the asics or any specific hardware to mine. The only risk with EIP 1559 is to get too many small miners going to other cryptos due to the reduced profitability of ETH and getting them replaced by ASICS which are owned mostly by companies in China which will have the negative effect to centralize the hashrate. This could be a problem when moving to pos and merging eth 1 to eth 2.

After EIP 1559, miners will get 2 ETH. A sudden ~50% drop in mining rewards sounds like an unnecessary risk. A sudden change in this complex network can have many unintended consequences. One potential consequence in suddenly dropping the mining rewards is mentioned here\u2026 but there are likely others that we are not predicting. There has never been a drop in mining rewards this large. the first reduction was 40%, from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, then 2 years ago there was a drop in mining rewards of 33% 3 ETH to 2 ETH\u2026 there have been no issues\u2026 but also this is a ~50% drop and there was a lot less at stake in the past and there was a less of a complex network of hashrate markets. Why take such a risk? I don\u2019t want to pretend to be an expert on either side, but there has got to be a way to include EIP 1559 while also reducing the miner rewards in a more gradual way than just a 50% drop and we hope nothing goes wrong.

                    "content": "Hello everyone. I am a rather large Ethereum miner - currently mining at about 150 Gigahashes mining ETH. I have mined Ethereum since genesis block. I built a business around mining and have personally brought millions of dollars into the ETH blockchain itself through my hosting company. During the last 6 years in the industry, I have followed the GPU mining market very closely and have watched a number of projects lose their footing to 51% attacks. On the other hand, I also am a major ETH HODLer and I believe in the project long term. I participate in DeFi and am learning more about NFT\u2019s. I have my feet in multiple \u201ccamps\u201d of the Ethereum community, but my expertise lies in the mining ecosystem. That all being said, major upheavals in the mining economy of Ethereum do not happen in a vacuum. Ethereum has enjoyed being the \u201cbest in class\u201d for mining since its inception and has not had to worry about a lot of security problems that many other PoW chains are forced to address. And as a result, I believe that has contributed to a large degree of hubris over the last year or so. Reading ETH twitter confirms this hubris to me on a daily basis. This kind of hubris looks to be playing a large role in downplaying miners\u2019 concern and misrepresenting their concerns as \u201cgreedy.\u201d As a result of talking past each other and seeing each camp as having nefarious intentions, communication seems to have broken down completely.I am reading many tweets about how miners are purposefully trying to stop Ethereum development. I have seen tweets arguing to reject 969 simply because miners attempted to show that a 51% attack is possible NOW, which means it is far more possible after revenue is cut in half. And this perhaps misguided move was attempted only after Bitsbetrippin has built models around the risks that appeared to have been ignored. I\u2019ve seen tweets that miners tried to 51% attack the network. The only party who could have 51% attacked the network IF that threshold was reached was Ethermine and they weren\u2019t even a party to the \u201ccollusion\u201d effort. So this claim is nonsense, and it demonstrates to me that a lot of the influencers are overreacting to the miners looking to prove a point. Miners have no intention of stopping development on the network, as some people claim. Miners know PoS was on the roadmap, and we have accepted reduction in block rewards multiple times (that were meant to increase price but didn\u2019t). We understand fees are high and we want DeFi and NFT\u2019s to grow. There was obviously miner opposition to EIP1559, but miners have coalesced behind BBT, who is not proposing we remove EIP1559 at all. What are we stopping exactly? In fact, there have been a few miner-backed proposals that did not get accepted. No one is saying devs are trying to stifle development on the network as a result of these EIP\u2019s not getting accepted. I got in this space for its long term utility, and to support in a way I understood how, not to leach on to the work of others. I support layer 2 solutions, PoS, and once it was accepted by ACD, EIP1559. Miners are seen as a carbon-creating evil that must be stopped at all costs. Every single miner I know mines green, including my business. Those that don\u2019t usually wise up and send a green mining co their equipment. We get all carbon neutral power. And that is the norm because power is cheaper when it is renewable. Smart miners set up their shops in renewable, asymmetrical energy production sites where supply varies wildly, and we can capture the difference in supply and demand. You are seeing this daily with wind, and seasonally with solar and hydro. Miners lately have been characterized as not ETH HODLers, which is untrue. I peruse various forums and groups all the time and miners are so excited about their mining rewards and plan to hold. I personally am holding as much ETH as I can. I have purchased 0. That is mind boggling to be able to participate in crypto finance by just providing a service to the network. Furthermore, miners are characterized as bad because they have overhead v. stakers which do not. I advise to all of my clients to grow their ETH as much as possible, and pay their hosting fees to me from more outside investment. Almost all of my clients have not sold a single ETH. Furthermore, my business is able to HODL all our ETH by sustaining our existing and bringing on more clients. We have not sold a single ETH since June of last year. Mining businesses can never sell their ETH by intelligently designing their business models. Now that I\u2019ve addressed many of the ad hominem or general attacks against miners, I hope I can address the miner concerns as they relate to ETH which are as follows:  The change in rewards is too stark, too quickly. Here the local utility raised the rates of crypto miners, but they did so over the course of four years in order to give crypto miners the chance to adjust their business models. While I wish the increase wasn\u2019t as steep, the truth is the utility was able to retain much of the revenue from those businesses as they did not go under. One county over, their utility raised rates overnight 500% and it killed a number of jobs there in one day. The utility has since reached out asking why the miners are now offline. They thought they could simply absorb the cost differential, and now the utility gets 0 revenue from those businesses. The point is, in multi-billion dollar industry, change is designed to be incremental so we can see the effects of policy play out. EIP1559 as its written does not allow devs the time to react if there was a miscalculation. The risk for 51% attack is real, and Ethereum has a lot of enemies right now. The truth is there have been over a half a dozen 51% attacks and all of them were during that unstable transition between GPU miners and ASIC\u2019s, or not best \u201cin class\u201d mining hashrate. VTC had Lyra ASIC\u2019s, ZEN had Equihash ASIC\u2019s, ETC was not best in class. Ethereum may find itself in BOTH situations where ASIC\u2019s are proliferating on their network, centralizing hashrate, AND RVN can compete for GPU hash due to its high emission rate relative to Ethereum. RVN does not need as a high of a price because its emission schedule is so much higher. Profitability falling off a cliff during a bull market leaves a lot of hashes on Nicehash wondering where to go. It\u2019s kind of a perfect storm. Raising the BR to 3 and tapering is still in line with minimum viable issuance policy (MVP). I have seen some disingenuous arguments made saying we cannot raise the BR as its an increase in issuance. This is not the case. Miners would still experience a net loss in effective revenue the day when EIP1559 launches. And through the burn mechanism, it woud be a net issuance decrease as well. And miners would likely accept (I would) a tapering schedule that would be a net loss in Ether over x period. The point we\u2019re trying to make is that the shock in the mining economics causes a risk. We are not fighting for more Ether in the long run. The timetable to 2.0 is the main driver for that. Some stakeholders are just saying they\u2019re going to rush 2.0. This is dangerous also, and anyone who argues it is not is taking an emotional stance. It is absolutely dangerous to rush a massive security consensus change on the 2nd largest blockchain in the world because of political reasons. ETH should be focused on scaling, not politics.  Anyway, I hope this is a level-headed post in a heated discussion around EIP1559 and Bitsbetrippin\u2019s EIP 3368. I think its important to retain a sense of community. Miners have been getting beat up lately, and it\u2019s actually kind of emotional to some of us to steer our entire career towards protecting a network silently in the background, only to have the entire segments of the community seem to switch gear and beat up on you. No matter what the outcome, I wish ETH success. I will be HODLing. ",

In any conversation, it is important that we assume positive intent, and having this discussion in long form makes it easierto assume positive intent than in twitter. Miners have a very relevant and informed perspective, but because of the existence of a monetary incentive, they are being assumed to have negative intent. This is incredibly short sighted. I\u2019m really happy BitsBeTrippin is beginning to be heard, and am confident that these VERY VALID CONCERNS will be heard by the risk adverse core devs in charge of these sorts of major upgrades. Full Disclosure: I have a very small mining operation (about .08 ETH a day, which PALES in comparison to my ETH holdings as a very early adopter), it was an educational experiment\u2026 I bought my rig from someone who was mining on NiceHash so i continued to use NiceHash, as selling my hash rate looked to be giving better returns than just mining directly from a pool. I am confident my rig was used to 51% attack ETC, and this honestly really pissed me off and I still feel guilty about it and I do not use Nicehash any more (In some ways, ETC is my baby, but thats another story  ). I don\u2019t think anyone can credibly attack my commitment to the success of Ethereum, nor my overall understanding blockchain networks (I have the first masters degree in digital currencies\u2026 ever)\u2026 This tiny bit of mining perspective, plus a focused study of Token Engineering for the last couple years helps me see how real and unnecessary this risk is. I am much more bias by my ETH holdings than my small mining rig set up, that is really more of a conversation piece in the Giveth home than any thing else. Please, so many people have so much riding on the continued trust of the Ethereum network\u2019s security, let\u2019s assume positive intent and listen to our well informed mining friends about this valid concern, and address it before adding EIP1559 to the network.

The last thing we need is toxicity and let bad \u201cnews\u201d articles and tweets with false information drive the discussion. It is obvious that miners also care about the future of ETH as many of them are bag holders and DiFi users. Miners also has been working as ambassadors for ETH in the crypto space for years. I discovered this thread after a tweet. I hold some ETH but is no whale of any sort. I work as an IT security consultant and has 20+ years in the field. This is why this EIP caught my eye. Playing around with the security reward midair when POS is 2-3 yeas out seems completely unnecessary. Why risk it. Even if you think the risk is very small. It\u2019s not zero. Let not take the risk with a 200+B network. The risk/reward do not make sense to me. I think the functionality and trust in ETH drive the price more than a tiny fee burn ever will create. Trust will be reduced if the developers can change a big security settings midair and ignore concerns from folks like this BBT that as put down the work to show multiple scenarios where this fee burn can create danger to the network. To dismiss all folks that think fee burn is a security risk as greedy miners is too simplistic. The best solution is often a middle ground. Pardon my English, it is not my first language. /A.A ",

Increasing the reward and then decaying it over time addresses the issue of sudden miner reward drops, and decreasing it from 2 to 1 addresses the issue of \u201cwe are overpaying for security\u201d. If the goal of the EIP is only to have a net-neutral issuance reduction then the EIP should ramp back up over time to the current reward of 2 (would need to do a bit of math to figure out the correct curve to achieve net neutral with a decrease followed by an increase).

There may be reason to extend or truncate the move from 2 to 1 that shouldn\u2019t affect the move from 3 to 2. And it gives devs more control in the event of 2.0 delay or separately in the event of unforeseen developments in the mining space directly after EIP1559. I am seeing a lot of posts here talking about how this will definitely bring up more net ETH to miners, but that may not be the case. I actually am okay with it being a net loss emission rate to miners over a 2 year period, but should be tied to milestone achievements by 2.0 devs. Smoothing out this emission schedule makes sense. One more thing I didn\u2019t note in my earlier long post: I fully expect the bull market to be raging in July, but I also recognize that this bull market is largely taking signals from BTC, which generally moves in 4 year cycles. If the party stops this July or so which isn\u2019t an unreasonable position, you could have a severely cut mining revenue measured in ETH terms IN ADDITION to negative price shock (outside of ETH\u2019s control) which is another combination of events that can lead to a risky environment that could lead to a 51% attack.

To be honest, Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle has more impact. In a bear market, especially with EIP1559, issuance is the security budget. How would an increase in the security budget make ETH less resilient? Resiliency does not mean positive price action. Resiliency means security. Furthermore, likely the bear market, if BTC\u2019s history is an indicator, would begin in late fall, early winter, where the BR would likely be somewhere between 2 and 3.

Basic economics of supply and demand, along with watching Bitcoins emission schedule, halvings have resulted in exponential growth. We could have one heck of a good debate if that is a current short term good thing for Eth or not, ahead of any proper scaling. A 3-5k Eth price is great for everyone that hodl eth and mines it for sure, but is down right asinine for users or prospective users UNTIL the L2/Sharding can help solve the fees. Usage decreases, scrutiny hits all time high that it\u2019s effectively became too expensive to do anything unless your spending big money on transactions. This is a completely different argument, not for this EIP, but addressing the statement that the inflation rate would \u2018destroy\u2019 ETH\u2019s blossoming \u201cSoV\u201d narrative (it has NO upper bound, wth are you even talking about) With regards to EIP and why the suggestion of a potential increase and decay. The basic analysis that has been completed show\u2019s 10 different scenerios,  specific to three key inputs.   Total potential hashrate - This is established by looking at known/known existing Eth Hashpower on network now, roughly 410 TH of output. + sum total of other GPU enabled Networks, calculating additional potential of Hashpower, which last calculation was roughly additional 110 TH of potential. The current growth curve, due to Eth\u2019s price/yield still is higher than most folks break even, thus more hashrate continues to increase near the point of equilibrium on the average ops cost to mine/operate.   Ethereum Price   Yield produced /v MH - (Currently Block Reward + Fee/\u2018MEV\u2019 + Orphan Inclusion)   My concern I raised at the ECH, that was refuted with \u2018MEV, MEV, MEV\u2019 declarations that when/if properly configured at the mining pool, they could extract a majority of the (fee) thus resulting in a much less potential \u2018loss\u2019 with the Basefee Burn. That very well maybe the case, not refuting that, I think the data you have provided along with reading into the flashbots discord has provided ample evidence this claim maybe in fact true. It\u2019s on the mining pools now to configure and ensure their miner clients are able to participate in the yield. The great risk though rest in the shear size the network has grown (Natural effect of PoW + traditional incentive model, working as intended) and will continue to grow ahead of the July London Hardfork. What is being missed is the fact much of this growth comes in the form of new participants, continued social media fervor (Linus Tech Tips yesterday, 13.1m sub channel showed his audience how to use NiceHash Quick Launcher, which focuses on Eth Mining Only) which puts additional pressure factors of risk, bringing up the 'nice hashable attack amount\" mixed with potential immediate yield hit on Eth, which we both agree could be LOW if conditions are right (high price, medium sized MEV); risk is next to nil in that regard. My concern stims specifically around a overall change in the environment where we could have rapid price decrease for whatever reason, atop the yield decrease, atop other chains being able to take from Eth\u2019s PoW dominance. The world is bigger than just Ethereum in the PoW space and other coins have gained some ground on taking hashrate away from Ethereum. This coupled with those other rapid decrease potential, no matter how small a percentage does not get around to the fact the Ethash Algorithm is not 51% protected and that Algo has been attacked on multiple other networks successfully. The entire point is centered around protecting Eth\u2019s network full stop. If a tapered emission schedule is \u2018not worth it to\u2019 the community, as ironically greedy as that sounds, then Eth should seriously consider a 51% attack solution other than the incentive to mine that wins by shear force. Implement what ETC had to do with MESS, Gravity Well or some other form of 51% attack protection against Ethash. That serves no emission and protects against the threat we are concerned against. Lastly I am updating the models that again show a range of theoretical attacks given specific scenarios, but I will reiterate there is nothing theoretical about the ethash currency being susceptible to a 51% attack, because it has, multiple times. I am arguing the climate, scale and incentive has changed and eth is no longer as protected as it once was. I hope I am greatly wrong and have no problem accepting the fact if nothing happens when nothing is done about it, I was lucky incorrect as we all have a lot to lose if nothing is done and I end up being unfortunately, for whatever left field (series of events that lead to 51%) turns out to be correct.

What is completely lost it seems here is the burden of loss (burn) isn\u2019t really on the Miner as much as it is on the user. User\u2019s are paying for the inclusion at high fees, not miners, miners are incentivized to order sort highest transaction value first and include with block reward. But the narrative is switched to 'by burning we can drive value to eth\u2019s bottom line\" This doesnt promote using ethereum, this promotes hodl ethereum and resting on the backs of people that use ethereum to burn a portion of their contribution for the betterment of everyone else.

The average transaction value back in August when everything was on fire was 240gwei, it costed me 12.xx to interact with a smart contract at 338.xx eth price. Now at 1800 eth price, that same contract interaction cost me 400+ at 540 gwei pricing. What am I missing here if eth price 5k and nothing is done for scaling? Less people will use Eth, which IMO sucks, unless eth is going to go on a crusade and drive the SoV narrative not usability.     norin:  Do you have the latest data on this?

An offset was suggested to ensure the yield decrease was not so drastic to cause a significant pullback in hashpower, opening up risk to the network. This number could be adjusted to 2.5 vs 3, halving amount and as long as MEV does in fact make up the difference, it becomes a mute point.

I was really surprised when earlier this year that GPU mining at home was still profitable.  This was the motivation I needed to finally jump into crypto.  Otherwise, I would probably be looking at the sky-high prices of BTC and ETH and think \u201cI\u2019ve already missed that rocket ship.\u201d  Now I\u2019m starting to get interested in things like Defi and staking Eth 2.0, and as I complete my CS degree I\u2019m interested in developing on blockchains.  I\u2019ve also turned two of my co-workers as well as my cousin onto GPU mining with their gaming rigs, and one of them has also decided to invest more into understanding crypto and mining.  EIP 1559 and the resistance to the compromise EIP 3368 are confusing to me.  What is the motivation behind burning the fees as part of 1559?  Does the Ethereum community want to discourage new miners from joining just so that they can boost the value of their own ETH through deflationary pressure?  Please explain to me if the rationale is something other than just to maintain an exclusive clique. ",

This is especially true because of the next point.  The average transaction value back in August when everything was on fire was 240gwei, it costed me 12.xx to interact with a smart contract at 338.xx eth price. Now at 1800 eth price, that same contract interaction cost me 400+ at 540 gwei pricing.  The key thing you are missing is that the increased fees you are paying now are not driven by the price increase in itself, but by the increased demand for block inclusion. These can of course be correlated to some extent in that higher price can attract attention to Ethereum. Importantly, in a world where virtually no goods and services are denominated in ETH, people think about fees in fiat terms (like you just did). This means that given increased price of ETH and constant demand for block inclusion, you would just see fee amounts in ETH lowered and in fiat terms the same. The last few months lends evidence to this point: increased price has come with increased demand for usage of Ethereum. Of course lower fees are desirable through better scaling, but the idea that price should be a factor when thinking about scaling is not logical.  Personally I think arguing about the merits of the EIP is unproductive until we have more data than the speculation thus far. Considering we are mere days until the ACD call, my intuition is I don\u2019t see how building consensus around such a big change could be done in that time even if the data were available today, let alone Thursday. It\u2019s always possible the data paints a convincing picture the change is needed, but as of now I am unconvinced. ",

Not fair to throw that completely out, more of a general statement of proceeding with PoS ahead of scaling ready for prime time is interesting. As a participant that is not tracking the progress on discord or reading our ramblings, just wonder if that transfer of conflagration is going to be worth it to the foundation/acd and dApp makers when less burdened transactions are not a thing upon the merge.

It doesn\u2019t make sense to destroy the value of Ether and confidence in Ethereum for a short term gain that will almost certainly assure their destruction and GPU miners\u2019 most likely along with it. In line with this whole thread. I have got to ask all the miners brigading this thread and proposing this, and the EIP-1559 thread, where were you all when 1559 was proposed almost 2 years ago? Most of the people with strongly head opinions against 1559 and for this proposal have surfaced those opinions in the last month. Hard not to correlate that with greed given 60% of the total hashrate today wasn\u2019t even around when this proposal hit, and 50% of it joined in the last 6 months. Again, this is not an improvement proposal. It\u2019s an attempt by mostly Johnny-come-latelys to sustain or increase their already exorbitant bottom lines because these fees (largely due to the inefficiencies and gaming of the fee market miners are partaking in that 1559 partially aims to fix) set an unreasonable expectation of payment for service. I have no problem rolling the dice to see what happens if 30-40% of the hashrate suddenly drops off the network. Considering 50% of it just piled in on FOMO. The Johnny-come-lately GPU hashrate can go mine Raven, Grin, whatever. I have no interest in supporting hashrate that has no interest in supporting Ethereum in bear markets and in bull markets pile in and immediately make demands on a two year old EIP. I know BBT has been around, but he has largely riled up a following of profit seeking opportunists who should have been aware of 1559, PoS, etc. before making investments or reinvesting in mining on Ethereum. Stop scapegoating 51% attack via suddenly available hashrate for rent. If Ethereum\u2019s economic incentives at $.11 avg fees, 400 eth per day total tx fees paid, and $168 ETHUSD doesn\u2019t invite GPU/ASIC rented hash attacks (the conditions when EIP-1559 was created) AFTER a 50% ejection of hashrate in a 6mo period from Aug 2018 to Feb 2019 (where miner revenue from fees dropped nearly 80%), and 150k GH/s was made available (> the GH/s securing the network at the time), there is absolutely no reason to think miners will suddenly make all their hashrate available for rent, unless part of a coordinated effort, which is a bigger issue with proof of whatever\u2026 We were paying an avg 170k GH/s of hashrate nearly 2000 ETH in avg fees daily in January 2018 at an average price price of $950 ETHUSD ($1,900,000 avg daily fees paid), basically at the top of the fee and price runs that cycle. 8 mos later in August 2018 we were paying nearly 300k GH/s (yes it went up because hashrate lags price / hype) 750 ETH in avg daily fees at an average price of $300 ETHUSD ($225,000 in avg daily fees paid). That means we were paying  nearly 80% MORE hashrate, nearly 88% less in fees\u2026 where were the proposals to increase BR then? When the network ejected all of that new hashrate plus 15% more over the next 6 months, why didn\u2019t it convert to rented/auctioned hash and foster attacks against a chain in an even more vulnerable economic state? Probably because the ability to successfully capture majority hashrate via rented hash has always been a) infeasible with what is ACTUALLY rentable, and b) too costly for profit, even at the most vulnerable points of the last bear cycle.

Doing it on ETC, or like, for which a magnitude more hash than their total hash is available on rent is one one thing. But claiming the same for ETH, with only a fraction of hash readily available on rent is another. It is not feasible. As I said earlier, during large parts of the last bear run, you could theoretically 51% ETH with less than $100k per hour. At times it was less than $30k per hour. NOTHING HAPPENED. Because if you build the scenario for ETH, you will realize that it will not be successful. ",

The environment in the past does project a level of confidence that nothing in fact will occur, if the start to retrace, mining traditionally follows that appropriately. My raise of consern now is highlighted in the Medium article. If the entire market retraces appropriately, no real creditable threat unless an obvious one was placed on NiceHash with some crazy buy order, I think everyone would be able to see that and act appropriately (hopefully) The core of the concern rest on the size the mining industry has grown to around Ethereum and a change that adjust the dynamics on how things operate on a fee structure could have a unintended consequence on incentive structures. A lot of this is in the delivery as much as it is in an example of how technical debt has came back to bite everyone. IF 1559 was implemented before the DeFi hype, the total size of eth participation would of been held back some. As a miner, this is a conflicting situation, as a user I absolutely hate high fees, as a DeFi participant, it scares me we are getting into a range of uncertainty that this causes on the ecosystem as an investor going long on ETH I see the eventual pontential in the long run it will have for Eth\u2019s Price Discovery. Weighing all of those factors I can not ignore the risk the size of this potential mining power has when some scenarios play out, that\u2019s where the risk plays in for me. This EIP was designed to lessen that uncertiny with the security that keeps Eth\u2019s network safe while tailing off emission toward PoS integration. The total emission over the time is the same over the 2 year period. If PoS is going to happen much sooner, then this is just a risk reduction proposal, but no doubt its going to get casted in the light of bad for the hodl clause. Maybe nothing is done and it works out (high likely-hood). Maybe nothing is done and an entirely different issue such as mining pools revolting and mining empty blocks (possibility). Maybe nothing is done and a catastrophe happens (much less likely). As a participant it\u2019s an uneasy situation. We will talk past each other on risk and take a hit on social credit no matter the outcome. Having a tool case of options on the table should not hurt anyone in this. MESS, DGW and other protections are options too. ",

You couldn\u2019t get a V10 in small batches and couldn\u2019t get them outside of China at all, same for much other privately funded fixed function and general purpose hardware and software, you would not have been offered.

This can only happen if every miner has a marginal cost = the the BR at the moment and we know it is not true. If say 50% miner turn off mining then the reward for the rest of 50% miner will double and be back to what it is today. And since miners are making good profit at the moment which mean more miners will then join mining again. In a worst case scenario I think hash rate may drop 20% If EIP 1559 justifies increase in BR then the bear market where ETH price dropped 90% would have justified BR increase.
