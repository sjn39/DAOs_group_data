Two groups in a governing system are codependent on each other. One group is forced to be reactionary against the other, and vice versa. It creates a spiral that necessarily divides communities. American government is the really obvious example of this. A much healthier prototype for this kind of governance would have three DVCs as a basis. This way the groups aren\u2019t constantly defining themselves in opposition to each other. I\u2019m curious what people might think of as far as three sets of values to group delegates around, but what I\u2019ve been mulling over is forming DVCs around different end states for the currencies. \u201cDAI Everywhere DVC\u201d, \u201cBank Yourself DVC\u201d, and \u201cTokenized Bond Pioneer DVC\u201d could be a triad of committees that each has its own identity but removes the reactionary element of a two-party system, as an example. I know the goal is to ultimately have more than two DVCs, but if we prototype the system as having two parties, it will begin a process of reactionary interplay that could also simply be avoided. Thanks for reading!  ",

I had already been developing a third DVC strategy that I think fills a natural gap, so I can just accelerate that and \u201claunch\u201d it asap, which requires relatively little work. ",

It is puts people in a situation of making a purely binary choice of having to allow progress or hitting a \u201cstop-everything\u201d button for a lot of different moving parts. Having parties aligned to broader end-states than tied to one-specific game-plan or another will make it easier for delegates to assign themselves along principles rather than just an ideological yes/no vote on a current system. The power of these committees is determined by the current MKR-token holder views anyway (if everyone is super pro-endgame, then great, that party will denominate) but having more parties than just two gives people the opportunity to hedge their vote for-and-against certain policies as they are implemented (their are quiet a lot of stages to the endgame plan!) without opposing an entire roadmap.
